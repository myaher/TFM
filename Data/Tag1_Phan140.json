He had videos to film. He had growing up to do, things to learn, a plan to figure out, YouTube projects to begin. He had a family to disappoint, and fans to entertain, and a boyfriend to try to be the best version of himself for.</p><p>But in the soft, drunken, afterglow, everything seemed easy. They weren\u2019t asleep, for some reason, just laying, naked limbs tangled together despite the sweat. Phil\u2019s hair tickled Dan\u2019s neck, and it\u2019d been nearly two years, and Dan sort of thought this was the end game. Though, he\u2019d sort of thought that since the day he saw Phil\u2019s blue eyes in person rather than through a fuzzy webcam.</p><p>But at first it was fiery and intense and new, and Dan was afraid it might burn out too quickly for his liking. But then the fiery newness started to go away, and nothing felt empty. That was probably when Dan knew.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>It was a scarily naive thought. The decisive thought Dan and Phil would work. Professionally. Publicly. Romantically. Quietly. Indefinitely. But he believed it.</p><p>Youtube could lose relevance tomorrow. The worst of Dan could get the better of him. Dan and Phil could grow and change in ways that weren\u2019t so compatible. Phil could tell Dan he wanted to take time apart to grow and develop as people. All these things were perfectly able to happen. In fact, it was\u00a0almost likely. But, as Dan laid in the presence of the first and only man he\u2019d ever loved, and the only man he could ever see himself loving, he knew none of those things would happen. It was a very rare moment for Dan to feel entirely confident and certain in himself, his career, his relationship. But then and there he was.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d Dan breathed.</p><p>The words didn\u2019t hold any weight. They both knew it. The sad truth was that at the moment they couldn\u2019t, even if they were ready for such a commitment. Still, he said them. Because if they were a girl and a guy and this was a romantic comedy, instead of being two irrelevant young men enjoying a single moment of peace in an insane world, the words would mean something. And, before tonight, saying anything like them would have felt far scarier. The thoughts behind them were there. The \u201cif we could, I would.\u201d So, Dan would pretend for tonight that these words did mean something.</p><p>Dan felt the rumble of Phil\u2019s chest, their skin pressed together, before he heard the chuckle. \u201cM'kay,\u201d he said easily.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Dan replied with a soft giggle.</p><p>\u201cGay marriage isn\u2019t legal,\u201d Phil mentioned, voice quiet and deeper than it would be if they were fully awake, fully sober, and not in private.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d Dan replied, his own words a bit slurred with sleepiness. \u201cWe can go to, like, California and find a liberal courthouse and a socialist priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d Phil mentioned. \u201cWe could do one of those, like, civil partnership things,\u201d Phil said, as though he\u2019d looked into it. \u201cGives us the benefits and\u2014\u201d He yawned. \u201cWe could even have a party for it.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned a little at that, at the idea that Phil seemed to have looked into how they could stay together in the future. \u201cFuck that,\u201d he replied anyway. \u201cI want a husband.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned back. \u201cPeople\u2019ll come to their senses eventually,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll still be around when they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so?\u201d Dan asked, moving further into him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, yawning again. \u201cThen I\u2019ll marry you, Howell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cM'kay,\u201d Dan replied softly, yawning as well.</p><p>The morning brought no further comment on it, though it definitely wasn\u2019t forgotten. They kept tentative eyes on the news when the gay marriage \u201cdebate\u201d was brought up. How couldn\u2019t they? \u00a0</p><p>And Dan moved in with Phil. And their popularity grew. And Dan began thinking that the naive thoughts he had about the future might actually come to pass.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>June 2012</b></p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Phil said, alcohol on his breath.</p><p>\u201cMmm, yes?\u201d Dan asked, trying his hardest to focus on looking Phil in the eyes. They\u2019d had way too much to drink tonight and there wasn\u2019t a single part of him that could see himself regretting it, except that he might\u2019ve ruined the conclusion to today\u2019s vlog. Fuck it. They were in Vegas. It was Dan\u2019s birthday. Sue him.</p><p>Well, it was his late birthday celebration, but he was away with his boyfriend, legally allowed to drink in the states, and giddy on being in love and having an expensive hotel room. It was like back when they were in Jamaica. But with more alcohol and less scenery. So, he was going to enjoy himself a little too much. They both were.</p><p>\u201cYou know how in Friends\u2014\u201d Phil started.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked, lost.</p><p>\u201cFriends! The TV show,\u201d Phil replied, \u201cYou know with the: <i>so, no one told you life was gonna be this way,</i>\u201d he sang to the tune of the opening theme for friends, a slur in his voice. He proceeded to clap five times in quick succession.</p><p>Dan blinked, remembering the show. \u201cOh yeah! We should watch that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Shut up. But you know how in Friends they go to Vegas?\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan replied, not sure he did actually remember. He leaned into Phil, who was somehow not so drunk they both fell over. He just wrapped an arm around Dan and looked him in the eyes, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel all decided to get married?\u201d he continued.</p><p>Dan frowned, trying to make his brain think of more things than just \u2018<i>Phil</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>lean in and kiss</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>smells like rum and coke and those stupid fruity drinks that are for probably meant for girls but fuck it</i>.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWait, they all got married?\u201d Dan asked, frowning as he thought (or attempted to).</p><p>\u201cNo, Ross and Rachel got married. And Monica and Chandler were gonna get married,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s Monica again?\u201d</p><p>Phil gently pushed him away, and Dan still stumbled, reaching to grip Phil\u2019s arm and steady himself. \u201cI\u2019m making you watch these with me when we get home,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cWait, okay, so they got married,\u201d Dan said, straightening up a bit.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, reaching for Dan\u2019s wrist. \u201c\u2018Cause you can just elope in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Dan took his hand, leaning in and pecking him on the lips. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying we should elope,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, kissing him again. \u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re drunnnk,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019re you, fuck\u2019off,\u201d Phil whined in reply. \u201cWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan laughed loudly. \u201cI think marriage licenses work differently than that,\u201d he theorized.</p><p>Phil shrugged, pulling Dan closer to him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well. We could get married,\u201d Dan said, pecking Phil on the lips. \u201cBut then we\u2019d have to leave this perfectly good hotel room and the perfectly good hotel bed,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather fuck me than marry me, I see how it is,\u201d Phil said frowning.</p><p>Dan giggled, kissing Phil on the lips again. \u201cS\u2019my birthday so you have to do what I say,\u201d Dan said decisively.</p><p>\u201cYour birthday was like two weeks ago,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cOkay compromise,\u201d Dan said. \u201cWe fuck tonight, and get married tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>Phil thought on this for a moment. \u201cDeal,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>Dan kissed him again, this time longer and messier. \u201cWait,\u201d he breathed, pulling back. \u201cBefore we do the sex thing, I have to go be sick,\u201d he said, tapping Phil on the nose and giving a wink before walking into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHot,\u201d Phil called after him sarcastically.</p><p>Morning would bring hangovers and chuckles and jokes about eloping. It would bring too real thoughts about spending forever together. It would bring too real hopes that they would be able to get married one day, with a proper ceremony and reception, back in the country they grew up in, the country they met in. \u00a0</p><p>Then they would force themselves out of bed, film the rest of their vlog, and enjoy their final day of vacation in Vegas before they had to return home to real life.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>July 2013</b></p><p>Dan and Phil both watched the rainbow flags waving on the television, soft smiles on their faces. The headline read that the queen had voted queer. She had given her royal assent and the bill finally been passed to begin allowing same-sex marriage. The news reporters spoke about the first marriages probably taking place next summer. Dan felt that this had been a long time coming.</p><p>Dan had sort of imagined he\u2019d lost the privilege of marriage when he fell in love with a man. Part of him knew that one day he\u2019d be allowed to marry, though, and that day would come sooner now.</p><p>Right now, he didn\u2019t need marriage to be happy. He knew Phil felt the same way. They were in love, committed, recovering from a rough patch in their relationship, and focused heavily on their careers.</p><p>Still, they each knew as they moved closer to one and other, soft smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes as they watched the rainbow flags and the happy couples on the screen, that they wanted this one day. That the cheesy normal romance wasn\u2019t out of the picture. Dan held Phil\u2019s hand and they didn\u2019t speak, but they still heard one and other.</p><p>For a moment they allowed themselves to feel pride for who they were and how they loved one and other, and they allowed themselves to imagine a day in the distant future where they maybe no longer felt the need to hide. Where they maybe wore rings on their fingers. Maybe even shared a last name.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>March 2014</b></p><p>The next year and Dan had his laptop on his lap, open to a word document with messily organized ideas, a million tabs open on google about book publishing. They hadn\u2019t even decided if they were going to do this yet, but Dan was taken with the idea already. Phil could probably tell by his research.</p><p>There was a bit of wine in their systems and the ambiance of a simple afternoon in. Starting with a silly idea and some giggling, they had now filled two pages with ideas. Dan had never been more ready for anything. He hoped the motivation didn\u2019t slip away before they could actually do this.</p><p>Phil read a headline on his phone and smiled softly before flipping on the news. He sat beside Dan as the screen lit up with the happy faces of gay couples piling into courthouses to sign wedding licenses.</p><p>Phil sat beside Dan and leaned against him. Dan looked up and smiled.</p><p>\u201cThink we should head over?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cDan and Phil spotted eloping in a London courthouse,\u201d Phil replied. \u201cWe\u2019d be on trending for sure.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled. \u201cWell, we missed the chance to be the first so, might as well wait I guess,\u201d Dan said with a sigh. \u201cIf the gaming channel fails, we\u2019ll call that plan B,\u201d Dan joked.</p><p>Phil chuckled. \u201cMaybe next year,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling into Dan\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Things were almost only looking up for the two of them. Popularity, working for BBC, working with charity, Dan\u2019s recovery plan when it came to his mental health, Dan and Phil\u2019s relaxation of their boundaries around their relationship when it came to viewers. Every day was spent together, they were discussing huge projects and undertakings, they were making videos, they were generally just working on being so happy, and they were both pretty sure the general level of happiness in their life as partners (in business, in love, in life) would only rise as the years went on.</p><p>So maybe next year, if they could find the time.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>April 2015</b></p><p>They were in Japan. They\u2019d been in Japan for a few days, and they were standing on the balcony of their hotel room, looking out at the lights of the city. Something about being in exotic places was insanely romantic. Dan and Phil had been wanting to come here for ages.</p><p>This had been sort of crazy for them. They hadn\u2019t really done something so spontaneous since they had first met, but they\u2019d realized that they could do it. Money wasn\u2019t an issue, they had the time, and they could say they were doing it for their book. Still, when the cameras were off, Dan described it as their romantic getaway and Phil just giggled and went along.</p><p>It was hilarious to Dan that it sort of felt like a honeymoon. They\u2019d taken vacations together before, Jamaica came to mind, but it was never just them. Never just a romantic getaway. There was always something else to do.</p><p>Dan\u2019s arms were around Phil as they stood, looking out at the cityscape. They\u2019d gotten back to the hotel rather late and both of them were exhausted, but there was still a residual giddiness from the loveliness of the day keeping them awake.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d Phil said with a hum. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled. \u201cIn Japan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cYeah. Just like elope. We don\u2019t have to tell anyone,\u201d he murmured, turning his head to look at Dan.</p><p>\u201cGay marriage isn\u2019t legal here,\u201d Dan mentioned, leaving out the fact that they were foreigners and therefore probably couldn\u2019t actually get married in a different country.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI always forget we\u2019re a gay couple.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking weird,\u201d he said. \u201cI love being here, though,\u201d Dan dropped a kiss to Phil\u2019s neck. \u201cWith you,\u201d he added. \u201cIt just, feels so freeing, to be somewhere they don\u2019t really know \u2018Dan and Phil,\u2019 so we can just, like, be Dan and Phil,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil breathed, leaning back into Dan. \u201cI wish we could stay forever.\u201d</p><p>They looked out at the lights. God, it was romantic. They were far from London and their beds and the sofa, but Dan felt right at home there, resting his chin on Phil\u2019s shoulder and taking in the easy intimacy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u202fshould\u202fget married,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan replied. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the tour, the book, we\u2019ll be set after this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could even throw a fancy expensive wedding.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled and hummed thoughtfully. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the tour,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a place to live, though. A long-term place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Dan agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll do that after the tour too then. 2015 is planning. 2016 is tour. 2017 will just be us,\u201d Dan said. \u201cLife stuff. You and me stuff.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cSounds good,\u201d he admitted. \u201c2017\u2019s so far, though,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan looked over at Phil, his eyes reflecting the light of the moon and the city. \u201cIt just gives us time to get there,\u201d Dan said. \u201cThese are going to be the best years of our lives,\u201d Dan decided.</p><p>Phil smiled because he knew it was true. They were doing everything they never dreamed they would be able to do. Big creative projects, performances, presenting truer and more real versions of themselves to the world, growing into the people they were always meant to be, watching their relationship mature into the beautiful, committed, healthy relationship that it was always getting better at being.</p><p>\u201cI knew when I met you these would be the best years of my life,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Dan replied, chuckling. \u201cYou probably thought we\u2019d forget about each other after a few months.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled. \u201cMaybe at first, but when we were in my bedroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked me and then knew it was true love?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil elbowed him in the stomach. \u201cShut up,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI actually hate you.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned, holding Phil tighter against him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I meant. When you were actually there in person, and we just\u202fworked\u202fand I never wanted you to leave, you know? I wasn\u2019t like, \u2018yeah this is who I\u2019m gonna marry,\u2019\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018yeah this guy\u2019s gonna give me some of the best times of my life.\u2019 I definitely wasn\u2019t wrong,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan grinned, squeezing his arms around Phil. \u201cI\u2019m, like, extremely, madly, in love with you, you know,\u201d he mentioned.</p><p>\u201cYeah I know,\u201d Phil replied. He finally turned around in Dan\u2019s arms to look Dan in the eyes. \u201cI think you\u2019re the guy I\u2019m gonna marry,\u201d he decided.</p><p>Dan nodded thoughtfully. \u201cYeah. That might be cool,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Phil grinned and leaned in to kiss Dan on the lips. One of those smiling kisses where it wasn\u2019t quite effective because they were smiling too much, but the thought was there.</p><p>Dan wrapped his arms around Phil, kissing him properly. They had two days left in the beautiful, exotic, vacation, and they were sure as hell going to make the most of them.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>February 2017</b></p><p>Some days, the prospect of marriage didn\u2019t feel so close or so comfy. Some days it was the furthest thing from their minds. Some days, it was a scary sort of change that they didn\u2019t want to confront. Some days it was a desire hanging over them, reminding them that they were sort of missing something, but not providing any sort of way to get there.</p><p>Dan and Phil hadn\u2019t had two seconds to breathe once the tour started. Between the documentary filming, the performing, trying to continue to post videos, and being tourists, they had been fully drained. They had collapsed beside each other each night, content, fulfilled but exhausted. Eventually, the shows ran out and they returned home. They released their movie, the story of TATINOF, and then all of a sudden everything slowed down. They had done it. Done a Dan and Phil book and tour. Immortalized themselves, in a way.</p><p>And, now, suddenly, they had time. Time to think. Time to feel. Time to talk.</p><p>Dan tagged along to see Phil\u2019s family on Phil\u2019s birthday. His thirtieth. In some ways it felt like Dan and Phil were both just kids when they met and then almost overnight, they were these actual adults with semi-functioning lives. And now Phil was turning thirty. Thirty years of life. Eight of those years with Dan.</p><p>It felt like it was time for something. Something more. Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t exactly time, but it was getting much closer.</p><p>Phil was pretty sure he knew exactly what that something was when he and Dan were walking over the grassy hills by the beach on the Isle of Man with Martyn and Cornelia and Phil\u2019s parents. When Dan slipped down after stepping on an overhang, cursing. When there was a brief moment of concern before Phil started laughing. When he climbed down a bit more carefully and offered Dan a hand.</p><p>And when Phil captured the moment for Dan\u2019s Instagram as he deemed the occurrence very on brand.</p><p>They did sort of want everyone to know that they were up here visiting Phil\u2019s family together. To stop the questions that would no doubt be running through the fan\u2019s\u2019 minds, maybe. Maybe just to show off a little. Maybe as a step further out of \u2018the closet,\u2019 a term they had both sort-of grown to dislike.</p><p>And Phil knew again when Dan was laughing and making jokes with Phil\u2019s family like it was second nature. When Dan volunteered to help Kath in the kitchen and when Dan crawled up to lay his head against Phil\u2019s shoulder on the couch when he\u2019d finished. When they crawled into bed later that night and Phil thought about how strange it was that they hadn\u2019t spent Christmas together.</p><p>The next day, they got up early, beat Phil\u2019s mum even, and left a note on the counter saying they had gone off on a walk. Sappy as shit, but Phil knew his mother would smile. Perhaps while rolling her eyes.</p><p>The paths here were lovely to walk down, the area small. It felt a bit like a little corner of the world where no one else could see them. Where they were hidden away, untouchable.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Phil murmured, his voice quiet as he held his phone camera up. He and Dan had always loved photos. Capturing moments to come back to later.</p><p>Dan smiled looking over at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look cute,\u201d he said. His voice was soft, coated in fondness. \u201cFor Instagram. Maybe,\u201d Phil replied.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Phil said, knowing what Dan meant.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right time for this conversation, but Phil was never a patient man.</p><p>\u201cI want them to know you\u2019re here with me,\u201d he said softly. He wanted everyone to know, really.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan answered. \u201cMe too.\u201d Dan shoved his hands back into his pockets, dimple popping even with just the slight smile he wore.</p><p>They continued walking and Phil tried to sort out his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he said before he had the chance.</p><p>Phil supposed that if they were another couple, Dan might\u2019ve looked up in surprise. That Dan might have grinned and cried and said \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019 over and over. As it was, they were Dan and Phil, and this was not the first time the words had slipped past one of their lips.</p><p>So, Dan smiled a bit more, looking over at Phil. He pulled his hand from his pocket, offering it to Phil.</p><p>They didn\u2019t do that. Normally. But Phil was starting to think that they were going to begin redefining their normal. So, on the empty stretch of beach, Phil took Dan\u2019s hand. No one was around. Dan and Phil were the only two people in the world right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>Phil realized that if Dan had simply said yes, he would have been happy. He knew that they would have come into roadblocks, though. They would have to postpone.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked over at him. He smiled again, tugging Phil after him and down one of the grassy hills and toward the water. The ground was wet with the early-morning frost, but Dan sat down on the sand, gesturing for Phil to do the same. The two looked out at the ocean.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you want me to,\u201d Dan said quietly.</p><p>Phil was surprised by that, looking over at Dan. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d marry you tomorrow if we had a plan ready tonight,\u201d Dan said, looking at his left hand. At the finger that sometimes, like now, looked naked.</p><p>\u201cI wish it was that easy sometimes,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will get married though, won\u2019t we? Soon?\u201d Phil asked. \u00a0</p><p>There was a longing to his voice. A longing for the future that was he had wanted to be here by now. Phil wanted to get married. Wanted to have that silly domestic bliss. Still, he knew that he and Dan weren\u2019t entirely ready, despite their ages, their financial comfort, and the family and friends watching them to see when they would. They would know when they were truly ready. They would build up to it. That was what they did. Sink into it, adjust to it. Maybe it was caution. Maybe they just wanted to savor the journey.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answered. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time, we\u2019ll know,\u201d he said. Dan had the habit of knowing just what Phil was thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re not the spontaneity type, anyways, are we?\u201d He looked out at the ocean. The serenity of waves lapping up against the sand. The cool wind stung his cheeks and he\u2019d pulled away his hand to bury it in his pocket where it was warmer.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>Dan looked over at him.</p><p>\u201cCan we be engaged?\u201d Phil asked, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand.</p><p>Dan sort of felt like they already were, but a little clarification never hurt. This felt like Phil saying that he wanted to speed things up, just a little. Wanted to bring this dream a little closer to them. Dan and Phil never really got a proposal, at least not a dramatic and life-changing one, so Dan grinned.</p><p>\u201cAre you proposing to me, Phil Lester?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShould I get on one knee?\u201d Phil asked, also grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even got a ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cSome people get extravagant romantic date proposals with rose petals and\u2014\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Phil shoved Dan, pouting and Dan giggled.</p><p>\u201c\u2014champagne, and diamond rings, and long emotional speeches, and\u2014\u201d He was laughing too hard now as Phil punched him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Dan, fine, hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, what are you gonna do?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil just grinned, looking around and patting his pockets. He reached into his coat pocket. Pulling out a glove, he seemed to make a decision. He looked at Dan and grinned, getting on one knee, offering up the glove.</p><p>\u201cDaniel Howell,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not have a ring, but that\u2019s just another decision that you and me can make together. So please accept this glove as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you even get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum sent me out with them yesterday, now shush.\u201d He cleared his throat again. \u201cDaniel James Howell. We\u2019re up here visiting my family, and it always feels so right to have you here as well. I think I\u2019m lucky enough that I get to have my family wherever I am because you are my family. You\u2019re my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Phil&hellip;\u201d Dan said, smiling at the silliness of it, but also feeling tears gather. He hadn\u2019t been expecting to actually get emotional.</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re my best friend and my family and my partner in, like, everything that I do. I love that. I want to celebrate that in every way in the world. I want you to be right here with me forever. I want to make endless memories with you. I wanna promise you that I love you forever and ever and ever. So, if you will please accept this glove, which I spent my whole life savings on, and let me know. Will you marry me? Be my fianc\u00e9, then, when we figure it out, my husband?\u201d Phil was beaming at Dan, his eyes sparkling, holding out a goddamn glove, and they were so stupid, but Dan loved it so much.</p><p>Dan knew they were going to get married. He had always known, but somehow hearing it like this felt different. It felt real. It felt tangible. He couldn\u2019t help that tears were starting to slip down his cheeks. He giggled. \u201cYes,\u201d he said through his giggles and sniffles. \u201cOf course.\u201d He offered his left hand.</p><p>Phil grinned, sliding the winter mitten, with some difficulty, onto Dan\u2019s hand. Dan held his hand up and looked at it. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Phil retorted.</p><p>\u201cCome here, you fucking nerd,\u201d Dan said, still cry-laughing a little.</p><p>Phil stood and offered a hand to Dan. He pulled Dan up and smiled at him, bringing a hand to his cheek to wipe away tears with his thumb. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tell your mum we\u2019ve gotten officially engaged, though,\u201d Dan mentioned. \u201cIt\u2019ll ruin your whole birthday month.\u201d</p><p>Phil just grinned and kissed Dan again. \u201cHere,\u201d he murmured, handing Dan the other glove. \u201cIt\u2019s a matching set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent two of your whole life savings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Dan giggled. \u201cGod, you\u2019re such a fucking twat. Fucking engagement glove.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned, absolutely pleased with himself. \u201cI was actually going to grab the first rock I saw, but I thought I\u2019d use something you could actually wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfffft,\u201d Dan breathed. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing though,\u201d Phil said, grinning. \u201cWhy should love and commitment need to be represented by material items? I mean, who even\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan cut Phil off by pressing his lips to Phil\u2019s. \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he breathed, pulling back. \u201cI want a ring.\u201d</p><p>Phil just grinned some more. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he murmured, looking over Dan. \u201cLet me take a picture of you.\u201d He looked stupidly adorable in his hat, cheeks flushed from the cold, eyes just a little watery from the emotion. He looked so happy.</p><p>Dan chuckled but complied. (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQBNr4Ujx_3/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\">link</a>)</p><p>And when they returned to the house, and Kath asked how their walk was, they shared a glance and a smile between themselves and simply said it was lovely.\u00a0</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>May 2017</b></p><p>\u201cOh my God, no,\u201d Phil said between giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Dan asked, giggling himself.</p><p>Phil shoved Dan. \u201cWedding rings are supposed to represent eternal love, not be a goth fashion statement,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan pouted, moving back to sit against the headboard. Phil leaned his head against his shoulder again, and Dan smiled a little. Phil looked back down at Dan\u2019s phone.</p><p>The two of them were sat in bed having a lazy day. Things in the new flat still needed unpacking and neither of them had eaten anything but takeaway in about a week, but they were exhausted, so they were in bed. \u00a0</p><p>Dan was scrolling through Pinterest wedding bands that cost way too much because the tour was over, they\u2019d become engaged, they were moving, Dan was planning a lot of change with his YouTube, and even though he\u2019d now realized 2017 was far too busy without any plan of marriage, he knew it would be coming up in the next few years. He hoped it would. And he was impatient, and he liked to fantasize.</p><p>Dan clicked on a suggested image of the ring beside another similar ring. \u201cBut, look, they have matching ones, we could be aesthetic husbands,\u201d Dan said, grinning as he looked over to see Phil\u2019s expression.</p><p>Phil was unimpressed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, is black the most romantic of colors?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBlack is the only acceptable color,\u201d Dan replied.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see a black ring on someone\u2019s finger and think they\u2019re married, you just think they\u2019re some sad edgy person,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cBut I am some sad edgy person,\u201d Dan argued.</p><p>\u201cYeah but\u2026I\u2026Well, I\u2019m not,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying my wedding ring shouldn\u2019t be true to myself?\u201d Dan teased, climbing over Phil in a way that had become a little smoother over the years, and sitting atop his thighs.</p><p>Phil grinned, looking up at Dan. \u201cI definitely think it should,\u201d he said. He took Dan\u2019s left hand, looking at it. \u201cSo maybe something gold, hm? Maybe with some diamonds, I dunno. That\u2019s more you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He looked back up at Dan. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Dan looked affronted, \u201cDo you know me at all?\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned. \u201cBetter than you know yourself, Danny boy,\u201d he replied, leaning forward and kissing Dan on the lips.</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips twitched up, face remaining close to Phil\u2019s. \u201cMaybe silver.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed him again. \u201cMaybe the engagement ring can be black, or grey. With diamonds and sapphire.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cOh, so you actually are getting me an engagement ring, are you?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m getting you one too then,\u201d Dan decided. \u201cBut we probably shouldn\u2019t make it a surprise, because we have to coordinate.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to go on another tour with all this talk, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you we should\u2019ve eloped in Vegas during tatinof,\u201d Dan said with a sigh.</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again, rolling him over to kiss him properly, the two of them giggling.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>March 2018</b></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going on tour again,\u201d Dan said with a pout, head leaning against Phil\u2019s shoulder as he looked through wedding Pinterest boards, an activity that had started as a distant, somewhat joke of a dream in 2015 upon seeing a suit that Dan could just perfectly imagine walking down an aisle wearing and needing to save it. It had evolved into a more frequent activity and saving posts to his board called \u201csoon \ud83d\udc8d.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d returned from today\u2019s rehearsals and promptly collapsed on the couch together, Dan absently opening Pinterest and being bombarded by posts for wedding planning, seeing as he\u2019d only really gotten the Pinterest to save the stuff he wanted to remember for when they finally did do what they\u2019d been quietly planning with each other.</p><p>\u201cIt was your idea,\u201d Phil replied, fingers absently stroking Dan\u2019s arm as he looked at his own phone.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan said, still pouting. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be amazing,\u201d he said.</p><p>Phil smiled, looking over at Dan, noticing what he was doing on his phone. Phil\u2019s smile fell a little.</p><p>\u201cOne more hurrah, right?\u201d Phil murmured. \u201cGo out, see the world, meet all the people who support us, give a real show, a more \u2018us\u2019 show. Like you said. Then,\u201d Phil kissed the top of Dan\u2019s head. \u201cThen, we\u2019ll do some more \u2018us\u2019 things, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d Everything the two of them did was an \u2018us\u2019 thing.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Phil murmured, and Dan did. He didn\u2019t just mean them. He meant them in the romantic sense and in the life sense.</p><p>Dan sat up, shifting to look at Phil. \u201cAnd what\u2019s next for \u2018us,\u2019 Phil Lester? What\u2019s the official list?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cSo, the official list that we\u2019ve both been unofficially making together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Phil suppressed his grin as he replied. \u201cAlright. Well, of course, a forever home, right? Buy our own place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Dan agreed. \u201cObviously. Get that one in the works. What else?\u201d he asked, looking Phil in the eyes, grinning himself.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Phil replied, plucking Dan\u2019s phone up off the couch, still open to a picture of a wedding cake. \u201cMarry me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan smiled at the words. <i>Marry me</i>.</p><p>Perhaps it had lost its intense, romantic, sound. Perhaps that was okay. It didn\u2019t sound like a proposal. Now, it sounded like a promise. It sounded like home. Like the next item on their list. It wasn\u2019t a crazy, romantic, spontaneous, idea. It was the thing they\u2019d been dying to relax into for so long.</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed, leaning to kiss Phil softly on the lips. \u201cNo more putting it off? I\u2019m tired of being a fianc\u00e9,\u201d he said softly. \u201cA guy needs to level up. When we get home again, after the tour, are we gonna figure things out? Actually, do it?\u201d</p><p>Phil reached to push his curls from his forehead. \u201cYes. I honestly don\u2019t think I can wait too much longer,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Dan replied moving into Phil\u2019s side and wrapping his arms around his waist, leaning against him. \u201cPromise?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Dan hummed. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, pulling back to look Phil in the eyes. \u201cI wanna be your husband.\u201d</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>July 2018</b></p><p>It was a late night in a hotel room in the states. Dan was sat against the headboard, occasionally grabbing a chip from their mostly-eaten room service dinner. Phil had crawled up next to him and sat beside him, shoulders and legs pressed together. Nothing had really brought upon the subject. Phil had glanced over at Dan\u2019s phone to find Pinterest wedding boards again. Phil was never sure if he was dreaming wistfully about the future or if he just opened Pinterest when he was bored and thought \u2018that\u2019s a cool wedding cake idea, save that for the future\u2019 and then got pulled into a vortex of aesthetically pleasing table-settings, bridesmaid outfits, and wedding venues.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Phil murmured, surprising Dan.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked, turning his head to see Phil looking at his phone.</p><p>\u201cScroll back up,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan complied, and Phil pointed to a set of rings. \u201cWhat about those?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat, for wedding bands?\u201d Dan asked. The set was his and hers style, one being a silver ring with sapphires and a diamond, the other being a silver band with diamonds embedded and wrapping around it.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, maybe engagement ones,\u201d Phil said. \u201cDo you not like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Dan looked down, blushing a little. \u201cI already have one that I, uh, thought would be good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said, feeling warmth grow in his chest at that.</p><p>\u201cNot that I was planning anything special to do with it. We are engaged, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cYeah,\u201d he assured. \u201cWe are. I did propose, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cWe still calling that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it\u2019s a little more romantic than just talking about getting married sometimes,\u201d Phil argued.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s cozier,\u201d Dan admitted. \u201cAnd a bit less stressful.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cCan I see the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Tell me if it\u2019s trash, or whatever,\u201d Dan said, opening the safari app on his phone.</p><p>Phil looked at the ring.(<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/rings/cyorings/purchase_review/?did=1153325&amp;ucg=true&amp;sid=1152801\">link</a>)</p><p>It was simple enough, the setting was platinum, in an intertwined pattern, twisting into a design that seemed to be silver plant buds surrounding the gem in the middle. The gem was a sapphire, teal in color and cut round.</p><p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too girly, or whatever?\u201d Dan asked. It was a women\u2019s style ring, but the men\u2019s style engagement bands were so boring in comparison.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like it,\u201d Phil said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Did you pick one for yourself too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dingus, that\u2019s your job,\u201d Dan said. \u201cBut do be aware that if it doesn\u2019t compliment yours, I will be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said softly. \u201cAlright. No pressure.\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cPhil, you offered me a glove and I agreed to marry you, I don\u2019t think you should be too concerned.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d He leaned his head on Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat about the wedding bands?\u201d</p><p>Dan set his phone down. \u201cI think we should look at that once we have a plan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all figured out, wow,\u201d Phil said, yawning. \u201cThink I can help when we actually plan the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on if you have good ideas,\u201d Dan teased.</p><p>\u201cExcuse you. I have the most brilliant ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did agree to marry me, so I guess you can have good ideas sometimes,\u201d Dan said, settling down against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cSee, exactly,\u201d Phil agreed, leaning against Dan\u2019s shoulder again.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>October 2018</b></p><p>It had been a long few months, and a lot of hours of driving and flying and time to think. And it had been a lot of shows of meeting with fans, of hearing their thoughts, of having a real interaction with the people who watched their content and making more sense of the boundaries between an audience and the act. At some points in the tour, there were these deafening moments of realization. At some points, everything seemed much simpler.</p><p>Phil was worried that those moments would wash away as they returned back to business as usual. But they returned home, and things didn\u2019t change or revert.</p><p>It was even quieter at home, gave them even more time to just think, especially as they spent most of their first day back in bed. While Dan was asleep at a normal hour, Phil had woken up far too early from the jet-lag. He and Dan had to edit their film, had to try and get any opportunity they could to reach Brazil or Mexico with their tour, had to get back to work for a while, do spooky week, PINOF 10, and eventually something for Christmas, but after they didn\u2019t really have anything major planned yet in their professional lives.</p><p>Phil thought back to the beginning of the tour, to the end of 2017, their \u201clife stuff\u201d year. Thought about how much Dan\u2019s Pinterest board had filled up in the past few years. Thought about when Dan asked him to promise that they would finally do it after interactive introverts ended.</p><p>Phil had never been too invested in the idea of marriage. His brother hadn\u2019t gotten married to his serious, long term, girlfriend. His parents had more recently been quiet about their wants, though Phil knew his mother was probably holding out hope. He had never been desperate to get married, but he couldn\u2019t say he\u2019d never fantasized about it as a romantic and lonely teenager, at the beginning of his and Dan\u2019s relationship, as he and Dan started to relax into their domestic, committed, life. He\u2019d thought it impossible for so long, just a distant dream. He had been able to dull it down in his mind, come up with reasons it was impractical, or silly, or an outdated tradition. But with the option available, with Dan seeming so interested in it, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. He suddenly began wanting to write \u201chusband\u201d on medical paperwork, started to wish they got those silly words, those silly rings. He even started to fantasize about vows, about actually celebrating their love, their romantic love, in front of friends and family. And Phil knew Dan probably started to feel the same around the same time that all these feelings had surfaced for Phil.</p><p>Phil opened his phone\u2019s safari app, clicking on the page that had been favorited for a while. He already had his preferences set in, but he glanced them over again.</p><p>Phil smiled a little. He put it in his credit card information, and clicked checkout, purchasing the two rings.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>December 2018</b></p><p>Finally, the official Interactive Introverts DVD, as well as a Director\u2019s Commentary, was out of their hands, their work done. They continued to film videos between dreamful conversations about the next \u2018phase\u2019 of \u2018Dan and Phil\u2019 as a professional duo.</p><p>The slowing of their lives had left room for the sadness to sneak back into Dan\u2019s head, which made sense, seeing as this was much like a come down off of a high, but he was readjusting well. He got back into the swing of day to day domestic life with Phil and even began trying to pick up the healthy habits he\u2019d managed to beat into himself before the tour began.</p><p>Things were honestly really fucking good aside from the occasional overwhelm that could creep up on Dan when it came to the next move in his career. He had made a bargain with himself to stay off social media (for the most part), which was a bit harder than he had expected it to be, but overall helpful in his quest to rediscover who he was by himself rather than as an entertainer.</p><p>Christmas seemed to happen all at once. One day it was December 1st and the next they were in their rooms packing to visit Phil\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019ll spend Christmas together next year?\u201d Dan asked quietly, folding a t-shirt and setting it in his case. The question came up every year. It always felt odd to spend so much of their time together only to part for the holidays. Dan was spending a few days with Phil\u2019s family up North and returning to his hometown just in time for Christmas Day, but it was still strange to him that the two of them weren\u2019t able to be together on Christmas Day. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Phil said. \u201cIt\u2019s just tough getting our families together, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, as he always did in reply.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan agreed with a soft sigh, knowing there was nothing that could be done about it tonight. \u201cYou know, this won\u2019t fly when we\u2019re married,\u201d he said, lacing his tone with humor that was just a little forced.</p><p>Phil smiled in a sad sort of way. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure it out by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so far away,\u201d Dan said softly. Sometimes this stupid marriage thing felt like a dream where as soon as they got close to it, it moved further away.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan, frowning a little.</p><p>Dan sighed. \u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just the holidays, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always feels weird to not, like\u2026you know, be a family around Christmas.\u201d He didn\u2019t look over at Phil as he shoved pairs of socks into the pocket of his suitcase.</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes were on Dan, however. He thought of the small box containing two rings that were hidden away in the flat, somewhere Dan wouldn\u2019t stumble upon it. Maybe he should have gotten it. Should have given it to Dan right then as a reassurance of his intentions. Maybe he should have gone and grabbed it so they could bring it up North with them and he could give it to Dan there.</p><p>It was Christmas, though. And Dan and Phil were going to Phil\u2019s parents, and then Dan to his. Though Dan and Phil liked to think of themselves as already engaged, the rings would look and feel like a proposal, a more official one than the few they had shared. They deserved to have that moment by itself with nothing else to take from it.</p><p>Dan was folding his clothing a bit faster now, shoving it into his case a bit harder, his jaw tense.</p><p>Phil sat on the bed. \u201cDan,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Dan paused and looked over at Phil.</p><p>\u201cNext year,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better make good on that, Lester,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI always keep my promises,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cDebatable,\u201d Dan answered with a small grin.</p><p>Phil threw a pair of underwear at Dan. \u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned wider. \u201cOh, you do, do you? Hmm, let\u2019s see. \u2018Oh, Dan, I won\u2019t leave the cupboard door opens anymore, promise,\u2019 or\u2014\u201d Phil threw another item of clothing at him and Dan giggled. \u201c\u2014or \u2018oh, Dan, if you get the post today, I\u2019ll do it next time I promi\u2014\u201d Dan was cut off when a pillow hit him in the face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst and I hate you,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan just grinned. \u201cWell you promised to marry me, so sucks to suck,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Phil agreed with a smile. \u201cPick up those clothes,\u201d Phil said, motioning to the clothes on the floor by Dan.</p><p>\u201cOh, the clothes you threw onto the floor, sure yeah,\u201d Dan said, throwing a pair of underwear at Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Dan mentioned, and it sounded a bit more sincere than Phil would have expected.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Phil answered.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>February 2019</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were walking down the same path by the beach again. Phil\u2019s birthday had been lovely, as usual. It was cozy and in the company of family, and all in all a nice time. Dan enjoyed the seclusion of the Lesters\u2019 home even more than the times before today. They were enjoying being just them.</p><p>The last few years had been spent learning how to comfortably open themselves up. Now, they had an idea of where they were going career-wise and in the eyes of the public. The fear was gone. Or at least dulled a bit. And with no fear creating a wall between Dan and Phil and the eyes that watched them, it was time to relearn which moments not to share, which moments would just be theirs. Dan himself had decided to just be his for a while. So, it went without saying that this trip was theirs.</p><p>Last year, walking down this path, they thought about how they were basically a year into being engaged. They\u2019d talked about the year they were embarking on. A World Tour. There was no time for life plans, and they didn\u2019t mind it as much as they had expected. For a year, the Dan and Phil of everyday life were the same as Entertainer Dan and Phil. Most of the time, Entertainer Dan and Phil is what Dan and Phil wanted to be. And so, they loved it. They loved standing in front of people who adored them for reasons Dan and Phil didn\u2019t always understand, hearing rooms of people laugh because of something they said, meeting people who said that Dan and Phil made them happy, made them feel safe, gave them a community. They loved this family. Their family was this huge, messy, family of people who watched their content to be entertained and the two weirdos who created said content.</p><p>This year, they walked down the path, they thought about how they were basically two years engaged. They realized that they were back to a family of two again. Entertainer and everyday life had to find a balance again. They were home. They had time for life stuff. Dan wanted that life stuff more than he ever had before, and he knew Phil wanted it to.</p><p>Phil turned to the right and Dan followed as he walked down onto the beach, sitting on the sand. Dan didn\u2019t say anything, sitting beside him. The silence laid over them like a blanket, and Dan wasn\u2019t ready to peak his head out yet. It was comforting to be with someone without feeling the need to perform, to talk, to be interesting. Dan supposed that was one of the reasons he and Phil worked so well. Neither of them ever had to be interesting around each other. They could go for hours just listening to one and other breathe, or, as Phil was doing, taking in the way the other looked.</p><p>Dan looked out to the ocean, but Phil knew he could tell Phil was looking at him. Their eyes on one and other felt normal, comforting. They quite liked to look at each other. And Phil was quite liking looking at Dan as it was. Dan\u2019s hood was down, and his hair was a mess of curls, the wind playing with it, tangling it. When they returned to the house, Phil would run his fingers through it and untangle it. His cheeks were flushed pink from the cold, the one spot on his cheek almost red.</p><p>Phil gripped the box in his coat pocket with his left hand and took in a breath.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Dan looked over. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s for me too,\u201d he said. He pulled the box out of his pocket and set it on the beach between them. Phil could tell the second Dan realized. He flicked his eyes up to meet Phil\u2019s, almost hesitant.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Phil murmured.</p><p>Dan bit his lip, reaching out his left hand to take the lid off the box. He held his breath, letting it out all at once when he saw the two rings. He\u2019d seen one before, on a LED screen, after spending hours picking it out for Phil. The other was new. It was gorgeous. It complimented the one Dan had picked out for Phil. The intertwining ring setting ended in leaves which surrounded a dark jewel. (<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/custom-rings/Solitaire-Leaf-Ring-1154259/\">link</a>)</p><p>Dan felt tears well in his eyes. It was strange how two shiny pieces of jewelry could make so much emotion well in Dan\u2019s chest.</p><p>Phil watched Dan\u2019s reaction, smiling a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014uh,\u201d Dan started, going to touch one of the rings. \u201cThat one\u2019s mine?\u201d</p><p>Phil reached to grab the ring from the box. He held it between his fingers and offered it out. \u201cCan I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Dan replied, voice barely a breath. He held out his left hand for Phil. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was shaking due to the emotion, the cold air, or a combination of both. Phil slid the engagement ring onto Dan\u2019s ring finger and Dan felt tears leak from the sides of his eyes as he watched it take its place resting snugly at the base of Dan\u2019s previously naked ring finger. Dan held his hand out, looking at it. He choked on a sob, laughing a little at the silliness of the overwhelming emotion. \u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI want to start planning our wedding,\u201d Phil said, and Dan had been aching to ask the same of Phil. Christmas and Phil\u2019s birthday and work had stopped him, but he was so glad Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Dan said, voice broken with the emotion. He moved the box aside and moved closer, leaning in to hug Phil tightly, burying his face in Phil\u2019s neck, shoving off the hood he wore. \u00a0</p><p>Phil held Dan back just as tightly, and they breathed each other in, held each other close, let the reality of the words Phil had just spoken sink in. Phil breathed out shakily, holding Dan a bit tighter, feeling tears well in his own eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan answered, laughing through his tears. \u201cFor real this time.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed a little too. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. He pulled back to look him in the eyes. \u201cFor real. As soon as we get home, I want to find a venue. We\u2019re going to book a date.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled, a few tears slipping down his cheeks. \u201cWait,\u201d he realized, sniffling a little. \u201cLet me&ndash;\u201d He reached to grab the box, taking out the ring he had picked out for Phil months and months ago. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled, himself sniffling a bit as he offered his left hand to Dan. Dan slid the ring onto Phil\u2019s ring finger. He compared their two left hands. \u201cThere. We match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled, looking down at his engagement ring. \u201cI never want to take this off,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have everything worked out. In fact, they didn\u2019t have much of anything worked out. They didn\u2019t know how they were going to manage their marriage and engagement publicly. They didn\u2019t know if they would announce it or lead up to it or quietly allow it to happen without much conversation by them. They didn\u2019t know if they would have to take the ring off when they sat in front of cameras and for how long. No doubt they would spend hours and hours talking it through and asking advice and getting unsure and frustrated.</p><p>But none of that mattered because this was the first step. And Dan and Phil were definitely going to book that venue. Dan was thinking of April next year. Phil was picturing Dan in an over-the-top white suit. Dan was thinking about writing vows. Phil was wondering about wedding bands. The two of them were getting married.</p><p>So, for now, Phil said, \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p>",

He had videos to film. He had growing up to do, things to learn, a plan to figure out, YouTube projects to begin. He had a family to disappoint, and fans to entertain, and a boyfriend to try to be the best version of himself for.</p><p>But in the soft, drunken, afterglow, everything seemed easy. They weren\u2019t asleep, for some reason, just laying, naked limbs tangled together despite the sweat. Phil\u2019s hair tickled Dan\u2019s neck, and it\u2019d been nearly two years, and Dan sort of thought this was the end game. Though, he\u2019d sort of thought that since the day he saw Phil\u2019s blue eyes in person rather than through a fuzzy webcam.</p><p>But at first it was fiery and intense and new, and Dan was afraid it might burn out too quickly for his liking. But then the fiery newness started to go away, and nothing felt empty. That was probably when Dan knew.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>It was a scarily naive thought. The decisive thought Dan and Phil would work. Professionally. Publicly. Romantically. Quietly. Indefinitely. But he believed it.</p><p>Youtube could lose relevance tomorrow. The worst of Dan could get the better of him. Dan and Phil could grow and change in ways that weren\u2019t so compatible. Phil could tell Dan he wanted to take time apart to grow and develop as people. All these things were perfectly able to happen. In fact, it was\u00a0almost likely. But, as Dan laid in the presence of the first and only man he\u2019d ever loved, and the only man he could ever see himself loving, he knew none of those things would happen. It was a very rare moment for Dan to feel entirely confident and certain in himself, his career, his relationship. But then and there he was.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d Dan breathed.</p><p>The words didn\u2019t hold any weight. They both knew it. The sad truth was that at the moment they couldn\u2019t, even if they were ready for such a commitment. Still, he said them. Because if they were a girl and a guy and this was a romantic comedy, instead of being two irrelevant young men enjoying a single moment of peace in an insane world, the words would mean something. And, before tonight, saying anything like them would have felt far scarier. The thoughts behind them were there. The \u201cif we could, I would.\u201d So, Dan would pretend for tonight that these words did mean something.</p><p>Dan felt the rumble of Phil\u2019s chest, their skin pressed together, before he heard the chuckle. \u201cM'kay,\u201d he said easily.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Dan replied with a soft giggle.</p><p>\u201cGay marriage isn\u2019t legal,\u201d Phil mentioned, voice quiet and deeper than it would be if they were fully awake, fully sober, and not in private.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d Dan replied, his own words a bit slurred with sleepiness. \u201cWe can go to, like, California and find a liberal courthouse and a socialist priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d Phil mentioned. \u201cWe could do one of those, like, civil partnership things,\u201d Phil said, as though he\u2019d looked into it. \u201cGives us the benefits and\u2014\u201d He yawned. \u201cWe could even have a party for it.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned a little at that, at the idea that Phil seemed to have looked into how they could stay together in the future. \u201cFuck that,\u201d he replied anyway. \u201cI want a husband.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned back. \u201cPeople\u2019ll come to their senses eventually,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll still be around when they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so?\u201d Dan asked, moving further into him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, yawning again. \u201cThen I\u2019ll marry you, Howell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cM'kay,\u201d Dan replied softly, yawning as well.</p><p>The morning brought no further comment on it, though it definitely wasn\u2019t forgotten. They kept tentative eyes on the news when the gay marriage \u201cdebate\u201d was brought up. How couldn\u2019t they? \u00a0</p><p>And Dan moved in with Phil. And their popularity grew. And Dan began thinking that the naive thoughts he had about the future might actually come to pass.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>June 2012</b></p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Phil said, alcohol on his breath.</p><p>\u201cMmm, yes?\u201d Dan asked, trying his hardest to focus on looking Phil in the eyes. They\u2019d had way too much to drink tonight and there wasn\u2019t a single part of him that could see himself regretting it, except that he might\u2019ve ruined the conclusion to today\u2019s vlog. Fuck it. They were in Vegas. It was Dan\u2019s birthday. Sue him.</p><p>Well, it was his late birthday celebration, but he was away with his boyfriend, legally allowed to drink in the states, and giddy on being in love and having an expensive hotel room. It was like back when they were in Jamaica. But with more alcohol and less scenery. So, he was going to enjoy himself a little too much. They both were.</p><p>\u201cYou know how in Friends\u2014\u201d Phil started.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked, lost.</p><p>\u201cFriends! The TV show,\u201d Phil replied, \u201cYou know with the: <i>so, no one told you life was gonna be this way,</i>\u201d he sang to the tune of the opening theme for friends, a slur in his voice. He proceeded to clap five times in quick succession.</p><p>Dan blinked, remembering the show. \u201cOh yeah! We should watch that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Shut up. But you know how in Friends they go to Vegas?\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan replied, not sure he did actually remember. He leaned into Phil, who was somehow not so drunk they both fell over. He just wrapped an arm around Dan and looked him in the eyes, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel all decided to get married?\u201d he continued.</p><p>Dan frowned, trying to make his brain think of more things than just \u2018<i>Phil</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>lean in and kiss</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>smells like rum and coke and those stupid fruity drinks that are for probably meant for girls but fuck it</i>.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWait, they all got married?\u201d Dan asked, frowning as he thought (or attempted to).</p><p>\u201cNo, Ross and Rachel got married. And Monica and Chandler were gonna get married,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s Monica again?\u201d</p><p>Phil gently pushed him away, and Dan still stumbled, reaching to grip Phil\u2019s arm and steady himself. \u201cI\u2019m making you watch these with me when we get home,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cWait, okay, so they got married,\u201d Dan said, straightening up a bit.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, reaching for Dan\u2019s wrist. \u201c\u2018Cause you can just elope in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Dan took his hand, leaning in and pecking him on the lips. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying we should elope,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, kissing him again. \u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re drunnnk,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019re you, fuck\u2019off,\u201d Phil whined in reply. \u201cWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan laughed loudly. \u201cI think marriage licenses work differently than that,\u201d he theorized.</p><p>Phil shrugged, pulling Dan closer to him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well. We could get married,\u201d Dan said, pecking Phil on the lips. \u201cBut then we\u2019d have to leave this perfectly good hotel room and the perfectly good hotel bed,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather fuck me than marry me, I see how it is,\u201d Phil said frowning.</p><p>Dan giggled, kissing Phil on the lips again. \u201cS\u2019my birthday so you have to do what I say,\u201d Dan said decisively.</p><p>\u201cYour birthday was like two weeks ago,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cOkay compromise,\u201d Dan said. \u201cWe fuck tonight, and get married tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>Phil thought on this for a moment. \u201cDeal,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>Dan kissed him again, this time longer and messier. \u201cWait,\u201d he breathed, pulling back. \u201cBefore we do the sex thing, I have to go be sick,\u201d he said, tapping Phil on the nose and giving a wink before walking into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHot,\u201d Phil called after him sarcastically.</p><p>Morning would bring hangovers and chuckles and jokes about eloping. It would bring too real thoughts about spending forever together. It would bring too real hopes that they would be able to get married one day, with a proper ceremony and reception, back in the country they grew up in, the country they met in. \u00a0</p><p>Then they would force themselves out of bed, film the rest of their vlog, and enjoy their final day of vacation in Vegas before they had to return home to real life.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>July 2013</b></p><p>Dan and Phil both watched the rainbow flags waving on the television, soft smiles on their faces. The headline read that the queen had voted queer. She had given her royal assent and the bill finally been passed to begin allowing same-sex marriage. The news reporters spoke about the first marriages probably taking place next summer. Dan felt that this had been a long time coming.</p><p>Dan had sort of imagined he\u2019d lost the privilege of marriage when he fell in love with a man. Part of him knew that one day he\u2019d be allowed to marry, though, and that day would come sooner now.</p><p>Right now, he didn\u2019t need marriage to be happy. He knew Phil felt the same way. They were in love, committed, recovering from a rough patch in their relationship, and focused heavily on their careers.</p><p>Still, they each knew as they moved closer to one and other, soft smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes as they watched the rainbow flags and the happy couples on the screen, that they wanted this one day. That the cheesy normal romance wasn\u2019t out of the picture. Dan held Phil\u2019s hand and they didn\u2019t speak, but they still heard one and other.</p><p>For a moment they allowed themselves to feel pride for who they were and how they loved one and other, and they allowed themselves to imagine a day in the distant future where they maybe no longer felt the need to hide. Where they maybe wore rings on their fingers. Maybe even shared a last name.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>March 2014</b></p><p>The next year and Dan had his laptop on his lap, open to a word document with messily organized ideas, a million tabs open on google about book publishing. They hadn\u2019t even decided if they were going to do this yet, but Dan was taken with the idea already. Phil could probably tell by his research.</p><p>There was a bit of wine in their systems and the ambiance of a simple afternoon in. Starting with a silly idea and some giggling, they had now filled two pages with ideas. Dan had never been more ready for anything. He hoped the motivation didn\u2019t slip away before they could actually do this.</p><p>Phil read a headline on his phone and smiled softly before flipping on the news. He sat beside Dan as the screen lit up with the happy faces of gay couples piling into courthouses to sign wedding licenses.</p><p>Phil sat beside Dan and leaned against him. Dan looked up and smiled.</p><p>\u201cThink we should head over?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cDan and Phil spotted eloping in a London courthouse,\u201d Phil replied. \u201cWe\u2019d be on trending for sure.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled. \u201cWell, we missed the chance to be the first so, might as well wait I guess,\u201d Dan said with a sigh. \u201cIf the gaming channel fails, we\u2019ll call that plan B,\u201d Dan joked.</p><p>Phil chuckled. \u201cMaybe next year,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling into Dan\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Things were almost only looking up for the two of them. Popularity, working for BBC, working with charity, Dan\u2019s recovery plan when it came to his mental health, Dan and Phil\u2019s relaxation of their boundaries around their relationship when it came to viewers. Every day was spent together, they were discussing huge projects and undertakings, they were making videos, they were generally just working on being so happy, and they were both pretty sure the general level of happiness in their life as partners (in business, in love, in life) would only rise as the years went on.</p><p>So maybe next year, if they could find the time.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>April 2015</b></p><p>They were in Japan. They\u2019d been in Japan for a few days, and they were standing on the balcony of their hotel room, looking out at the lights of the city. Something about being in exotic places was insanely romantic. Dan and Phil had been wanting to come here for ages.</p><p>This had been sort of crazy for them. They hadn\u2019t really done something so spontaneous since they had first met, but they\u2019d realized that they could do it. Money wasn\u2019t an issue, they had the time, and they could say they were doing it for their book. Still, when the cameras were off, Dan described it as their romantic getaway and Phil just giggled and went along.</p><p>It was hilarious to Dan that it sort of felt like a honeymoon. They\u2019d taken vacations together before, Jamaica came to mind, but it was never just them. Never just a romantic getaway. There was always something else to do.</p><p>Dan\u2019s arms were around Phil as they stood, looking out at the cityscape. They\u2019d gotten back to the hotel rather late and both of them were exhausted, but there was still a residual giddiness from the loveliness of the day keeping them awake.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d Phil said with a hum. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled. \u201cIn Japan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cYeah. Just like elope. We don\u2019t have to tell anyone,\u201d he murmured, turning his head to look at Dan.</p><p>\u201cGay marriage isn\u2019t legal here,\u201d Dan mentioned, leaving out the fact that they were foreigners and therefore probably couldn\u2019t actually get married in a different country.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI always forget we\u2019re a gay couple.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking weird,\u201d he said. \u201cI love being here, though,\u201d Dan dropped a kiss to Phil\u2019s neck. \u201cWith you,\u201d he added. \u201cIt just, feels so freeing, to be somewhere they don\u2019t really know \u2018Dan and Phil,\u2019 so we can just, like, be Dan and Phil,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil breathed, leaning back into Dan. \u201cI wish we could stay forever.\u201d</p><p>They looked out at the lights. God, it was romantic. They were far from London and their beds and the sofa, but Dan felt right at home there, resting his chin on Phil\u2019s shoulder and taking in the easy intimacy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u202fshould\u202fget married,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan replied. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the tour, the book, we\u2019ll be set after this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could even throw a fancy expensive wedding.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled and hummed thoughtfully. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the tour,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a place to live, though. A long-term place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Dan agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll do that after the tour too then. 2015 is planning. 2016 is tour. 2017 will just be us,\u201d Dan said. \u201cLife stuff. You and me stuff.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cSounds good,\u201d he admitted. \u201c2017\u2019s so far, though,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan looked over at Phil, his eyes reflecting the light of the moon and the city. \u201cIt just gives us time to get there,\u201d Dan said. \u201cThese are going to be the best years of our lives,\u201d Dan decided.</p><p>Phil smiled because he knew it was true. They were doing everything they never dreamed they would be able to do. Big creative projects, performances, presenting truer and more real versions of themselves to the world, growing into the people they were always meant to be, watching their relationship mature into the beautiful, committed, healthy relationship that it was always getting better at being.</p><p>\u201cI knew when I met you these would be the best years of my life,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Dan replied, chuckling. \u201cYou probably thought we\u2019d forget about each other after a few months.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled. \u201cMaybe at first, but when we were in my bedroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked me and then knew it was true love?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil elbowed him in the stomach. \u201cShut up,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI actually hate you.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned, holding Phil tighter against him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I meant. When you were actually there in person, and we just\u202fworked\u202fand I never wanted you to leave, you know? I wasn\u2019t like, \u2018yeah this is who I\u2019m gonna marry,\u2019\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018yeah this guy\u2019s gonna give me some of the best times of my life.\u2019 I definitely wasn\u2019t wrong,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan grinned, squeezing his arms around Phil. \u201cI\u2019m, like, extremely, madly, in love with you, you know,\u201d he mentioned.</p><p>\u201cYeah I know,\u201d Phil replied. He finally turned around in Dan\u2019s arms to look Dan in the eyes. \u201cI think you\u2019re the guy I\u2019m gonna marry,\u201d he decided.</p><p>Dan nodded thoughtfully. \u201cYeah. That might be cool,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Phil grinned and leaned in to kiss Dan on the lips. One of those smiling kisses where it wasn\u2019t quite effective because they were smiling too much, but the thought was there.</p><p>Dan wrapped his arms around Phil, kissing him properly. They had two days left in the beautiful, exotic, vacation, and they were sure as hell going to make the most of them.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>February 2017</b></p><p>Some days, the prospect of marriage didn\u2019t feel so close or so comfy. Some days it was the furthest thing from their minds. Some days, it was a scary sort of change that they didn\u2019t want to confront. Some days it was a desire hanging over them, reminding them that they were sort of missing something, but not providing any sort of way to get there.</p><p>Dan and Phil hadn\u2019t had two seconds to breathe once the tour started. Between the documentary filming, the performing, trying to continue to post videos, and being tourists, they had been fully drained. They had collapsed beside each other each night, content, fulfilled but exhausted. Eventually, the shows ran out and they returned home. They released their movie, the story of TATINOF, and then all of a sudden everything slowed down. They had done it. Done a Dan and Phil book and tour. Immortalized themselves, in a way.</p><p>And, now, suddenly, they had time. Time to think. Time to feel. Time to talk.</p><p>Dan tagged along to see Phil\u2019s family on Phil\u2019s birthday. His thirtieth. In some ways it felt like Dan and Phil were both just kids when they met and then almost overnight, they were these actual adults with semi-functioning lives. And now Phil was turning thirty. Thirty years of life. Eight of those years with Dan.</p><p>It felt like it was time for something. Something more. Maybe it wasn\u2019t exactly time, but it was getting much closer.</p><p>Phil was pretty sure he knew exactly what that something was when he and Dan were walking over the grassy hills by the beach on the Isle of Man with Martyn and Cornelia and Phil\u2019s parents. When Dan slipped down after stepping on an overhang, cursing. When there was a brief moment of concern before Phil started laughing. When he climbed down a bit more carefully and offered Dan a hand.</p><p>And when Phil captured the moment for Dan\u2019s Instagram as he deemed the occurrence very on brand.</p><p>They did sort of want everyone to know that they were up here visiting Phil\u2019s family together. To stop the questions that would no doubt be running through the fan\u2019s\u2019 minds, maybe. Maybe just to show off a little. Maybe as a step further out of \u2018the closet,\u2019 a term they had both sort-of grown to dislike.</p><p>And Phil knew again when Dan was laughing and making jokes with Phil\u2019s family like it was second nature. When Dan volunteered to help Kath in the kitchen and when Dan crawled up to lay his head against Phil\u2019s shoulder on the couch when he\u2019d finished. When they crawled into bed later that night and Phil thought about how strange it was that they hadn\u2019t spent Christmas together.</p><p>The next day, they got up early, beat Phil\u2019s mum even, and left a note on the counter saying they had gone off on a walk. Sappy as shit, but Phil knew his mother would smile. Perhaps while rolling her eyes.</p><p>The paths here were lovely to walk down, the area small. It felt a bit like a little corner of the world where no one else could see them. Where they were hidden away, untouchable.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Phil murmured, his voice quiet as he held his phone camera up. He and Dan had always loved photos. Capturing moments to come back to later.</p><p>Dan smiled looking over at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look cute,\u201d he said. His voice was soft, coated in fondness. \u201cFor Instagram. Maybe,\u201d Phil replied.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Phil said, knowing what Dan meant.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right time for this conversation, but Phil was never a patient man.</p><p>\u201cI want them to know you\u2019re here with me,\u201d he said softly. He wanted everyone to know, really.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan answered. \u201cMe too.\u201d Dan shoved his hands back into his pockets, dimple popping even with just the slight smile he wore.</p><p>They continued walking and Phil tried to sort out his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he said before he had the chance.</p><p>Phil supposed that if they were another couple, Dan might\u2019ve looked up in surprise. That Dan might have grinned and cried and said \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019 over and over. As it was, they were Dan and Phil, and this was not the first time the words had slipped past one of their lips.</p><p>So, Dan smiled a bit more, looking over at Phil. He pulled his hand from his pocket, offering it to Phil.</p><p>They didn\u2019t do that. Normally. But Phil was starting to think that they were going to begin redefining their normal. So, on the empty stretch of beach, Phil took Dan\u2019s hand. No one was around. Dan and Phil were the only two people in the world right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>Phil realized that if Dan had simply said yes, he would have been happy. He knew that they would have come into roadblocks, though. They would have to postpone.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked over at him. He smiled again, tugging Phil after him and down one of the grassy hills and toward the water. The ground was wet with the early-morning frost, but Dan sat down on the sand, gesturing for Phil to do the same. The two looked out at the ocean.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you want me to,\u201d Dan said quietly.</p><p>Phil was surprised by that, looking over at Dan. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d marry you tomorrow if we had a plan ready tonight,\u201d Dan said, looking at his left hand. At the finger that sometimes, like now, looked naked.</p><p>\u201cI wish it was that easy sometimes,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will get married though, won\u2019t we? Soon?\u201d Phil asked. \u00a0</p><p>There was a longing to his voice. A longing for the future that was he had wanted to be here by now. Phil wanted to get married. Wanted to have that silly domestic bliss. Still, he knew that he and Dan weren\u2019t entirely ready, despite their ages, their financial comfort, and the family and friends watching them to see when they would. They would know when they were truly ready. They would build up to it. That was what they did. Sink into it, adjust to it. Maybe it was caution. Maybe they just wanted to savor the journey.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answered. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time, we\u2019ll know,\u201d he said. Dan had the habit of knowing just what Phil was thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re not the spontaneity type, anyways, are we?\u201d He looked out at the ocean. The serenity of waves lapping up against the sand. The cool wind stung his cheeks and he\u2019d pulled away his hand to bury it in his pocket where it was warmer.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>Dan looked over at him.</p><p>\u201cCan we be engaged?\u201d Phil asked, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand.</p><p>Dan sort of felt like they already were, but a little clarification never hurt. This felt like Phil saying that he wanted to speed things up, just a little. Wanted to bring this dream a little closer to them. Dan and Phil never really got a proposal, at least not a dramatic and life-changing one, so Dan grinned.</p><p>\u201cAre you proposing to me, Phil Lester?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShould I get on one knee?\u201d Phil asked, also grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even got a ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cSome people get extravagant romantic date proposals with rose petals and\u2014\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Phil shoved Dan, pouting and Dan giggled.</p><p>\u201c\u2014champagne, and diamond rings, and long emotional speeches, and\u2014\u201d He was laughing too hard now as Phil punched him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Dan, fine, hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, what are you gonna do?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil just grinned, looking around and patting his pockets. He reached into his coat pocket. Pulling out a glove, he seemed to make a decision. He looked at Dan and grinned, getting on one knee, offering up the glove.</p><p>\u201cDaniel Howell,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not have a ring, but that\u2019s just another decision that you and me can make together. So please accept this glove as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you even get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum sent me out with them yesterday, now shush.\u201d He cleared his throat again. \u201cDaniel James Howell. We\u2019re up here visiting my family, and it always feels so right to have you here as well. I think I\u2019m lucky enough that I get to have my family wherever I am because you are my family. You\u2019re my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Phil\u2026\u201d Dan said, smiling at the silliness of it, but also feeling tears gather. He hadn\u2019t been expecting to actually get emotional.</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re my best friend and my family and my partner in, like, everything that I do. I love that. I want to celebrate that in every way in the world. I want you to be right here with me forever. I want to make endless memories with you. I wanna promise you that I love you forever and ever and ever. So, if you will please accept this glove, which I spent my whole life savings on, and let me know. Will you marry me? Be my fianc\u00e9, then, when we figure it out, my husband?\u201d Phil was beaming at Dan, his eyes sparkling, holding out a goddamn glove, and they were so stupid, but Dan loved it so much.</p><p>Dan knew they were going to get married. He had always known, but somehow hearing it like this felt different. It felt real. It felt tangible. He couldn\u2019t help that tears were starting to slip down his cheeks. He giggled. \u201cYes,\u201d he said through his giggles and sniffles. \u201cOf course.\u201d He offered his left hand.</p><p>Phil grinned, sliding the winter mitten, with some difficulty, onto Dan\u2019s hand. Dan held his hand up and looked at it. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Phil retorted.</p><p>\u201cCome here, you fucking nerd,\u201d Dan said, still cry-laughing a little.</p><p>Phil stood and offered a hand to Dan. He pulled Dan up and smiled at him, bringing a hand to his cheek to wipe away tears with his thumb. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tell your mum we\u2019ve gotten officially engaged, though,\u201d Dan mentioned. \u201cIt\u2019ll ruin your whole birthday month.\u201d</p><p>Phil just grinned and kissed Dan again. \u201cHere,\u201d he murmured, handing Dan the other glove. \u201cIt\u2019s a matching set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent two of your whole life savings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Dan giggled. \u201cGod, you\u2019re such a fucking twat. Fucking engagement glove.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned, absolutely pleased with himself. \u201cI was actually going to grab the first rock I saw, but I thought I\u2019d use something you could actually wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfffft,\u201d Dan breathed. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing though,\u201d Phil said, grinning. \u201cWhy should love and commitment need to be represented by material items? I mean, who even\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan cut Phil off by pressing his lips to Phil\u2019s. \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he breathed, pulling back. \u201cI want a ring.\u201d</p><p>Phil just grinned some more. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he murmured, looking over Dan. \u201cLet me take a picture of you.\u201d He looked stupidly adorable in his hat, cheeks flushed from the cold, eyes just a little watery from the emotion. He looked so happy.</p><p>Dan chuckled but complied. (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQBNr4Ujx_3/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\">link</a>)</p><p>And when they returned to the house, and Kath asked how their walk was, they shared a glance and a smile between themselves and simply said it was lovely.\u00a0</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>May 2017</b></p><p>\u201cOh my God, no,\u201d Phil said between giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Dan asked, giggling himself.</p><p>Phil shoved Dan. \u201cWedding rings are supposed to represent eternal love, not be a goth fashion statement,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan pouted, moving back to sit against the headboard. Phil leaned his head against his shoulder again, and Dan smiled a little. Phil looked back down at Dan\u2019s phone.</p><p>The two of them were sat in bed having a lazy day. Things in the new flat still needed unpacking and neither of them had eaten anything but takeaway in about a week, but they were exhausted, so they were in bed. \u00a0</p><p>Dan was scrolling through Pinterest wedding bands that cost way too much because the tour was over, they\u2019d become engaged, they were moving, Dan was planning a lot of change with his YouTube, and even though he\u2019d now realized 2017 was far too busy without any plan of marriage, he knew it would be coming up in the next few years. He hoped it would. And he was impatient, and he liked to fantasize.</p><p>Dan clicked on a suggested image of the ring beside another similar ring. \u201cBut, look, they have matching ones, we could be aesthetic husbands,\u201d Dan said, grinning as he looked over to see Phil\u2019s expression.</p><p>Phil was unimpressed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, is black the most romantic of colors?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBlack is the only acceptable color,\u201d Dan replied.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see a black ring on someone\u2019s finger and think they\u2019re married, you just think they\u2019re some sad edgy person,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cBut I am some sad edgy person,\u201d Dan argued.</p><p>\u201cYeah but\u2026I\u2026Well, I\u2019m not,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying my wedding ring shouldn\u2019t be true to myself?\u201d Dan teased, climbing over Phil in a way that had become a little smoother over the years, and sitting atop his thighs.</p><p>Phil grinned, looking up at Dan. \u201cI definitely think it should,\u201d he said. He took Dan\u2019s left hand, looking at it. \u201cSo maybe something gold, hm? Maybe with some diamonds, I dunno. That\u2019s more you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He looked back up at Dan. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Dan looked affronted, \u201cDo you know me at all?\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned. \u201cBetter than you know yourself, Danny boy,\u201d he replied, leaning forward and kissing Dan on the lips.</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips twitched up, face remaining close to Phil\u2019s. \u201cMaybe silver.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed him again. \u201cMaybe the engagement ring can be black, or grey. With diamonds and sapphire.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cOh, so you actually are getting me an engagement ring, are you?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m getting you one too then,\u201d Dan decided. \u201cBut we probably shouldn\u2019t make it a surprise, because we have to coordinate.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to go on another tour with all this talk, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you we should\u2019ve eloped in Vegas during tatinof,\u201d Dan said with a sigh.</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again, rolling him over to kiss him properly, the two of them giggling.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>March 2018</b></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going on tour again,\u201d Dan said with a pout, head leaning against Phil\u2019s shoulder as he looked through wedding Pinterest boards, an activity that had started as a distant, somewhat joke of a dream in 2015 upon seeing a suit that Dan could just perfectly imagine walking down an aisle wearing and needing to save it. It had evolved into a more frequent activity and saving posts to his board called \u201csoon \ud83d\udc8d.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d returned from today\u2019s rehearsals and promptly collapsed on the couch together, Dan absently opening Pinterest and being bombarded by posts for wedding planning, seeing as he\u2019d only really gotten the Pinterest to save the stuff he wanted to remember for when they finally did do what they\u2019d been quietly planning with each other.</p><p>\u201cIt was your idea,\u201d Phil replied, fingers absently stroking Dan\u2019s arm as he looked at his own phone.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan said, still pouting. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be amazing,\u201d he said.</p><p>Phil smiled, looking over at Dan, noticing what he was doing on his phone. Phil\u2019s smile fell a little.</p><p>\u201cOne more hurrah, right?\u201d Phil murmured. \u201cGo out, see the world, meet all the people who support us, give a real show, a more \u2018us\u2019 show. Like you said. Then,\u201d Phil kissed the top of Dan\u2019s head. \u201cThen, we\u2019ll do some more \u2018us\u2019 things, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d Everything the two of them did was an \u2018us\u2019 thing.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Phil murmured, and Dan did. He didn\u2019t just mean them. He meant them in the romantic sense and in the life sense.</p><p>Dan sat up, shifting to look at Phil. \u201cAnd what\u2019s next for \u2018us,\u2019 Phil Lester? What\u2019s the official list?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cSo, the official list that we\u2019ve both been unofficially making together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Phil suppressed his grin as he replied. \u201cAlright. Well, of course, a forever home, right? Buy our own place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Dan agreed. \u201cObviously. Get that one in the works. What else?\u201d he asked, looking Phil in the eyes, grinning himself.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Phil replied, plucking Dan\u2019s phone up off the couch, still open to a picture of a wedding cake. \u201cMarry me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan smiled at the words. <i>Marry me</i>.</p><p>Perhaps it had lost its intense, romantic, sound. Perhaps that was okay. It didn\u2019t sound like a proposal. Now, it sounded like a promise. It sounded like home. Like the next item on their list. It wasn\u2019t a crazy, romantic, spontaneous, idea. It was the thing they\u2019d been dying to relax into for so long.</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed, leaning to kiss Phil softly on the lips. \u201cNo more putting it off? I\u2019m tired of being a fianc\u00e9,\u201d he said softly. \u201cA guy needs to level up. When we get home again, after the tour, are we gonna figure things out? Actually, do it?\u201d</p><p>Phil reached to push his curls from his forehead. \u201cYes. I honestly don\u2019t think I can wait too much longer,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Dan replied moving into Phil\u2019s side and wrapping his arms around his waist, leaning against him. \u201cPromise?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Dan hummed. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, pulling back to look Phil in the eyes. \u201cI wanna be your husband.\u201d</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>July 2018</b></p><p>It was a late night in a hotel room in the states. Dan was sat against the headboard, occasionally grabbing a chip from their mostly-eaten room service dinner. Phil had crawled up next to him and sat beside him, shoulders and legs pressed together. Nothing had really brought upon the subject. Phil had glanced over at Dan\u2019s phone to find Pinterest wedding boards again. Phil was never sure if he was dreaming wistfully about the future or if he just opened Pinterest when he was bored and thought \u2018that\u2019s a cool wedding cake idea, save that for the future\u2019 and then got pulled into a vortex of aesthetically pleasing table-settings, bridesmaid outfits, and wedding venues.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Phil murmured, surprising Dan.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked, turning his head to see Phil looking at his phone.</p><p>\u201cScroll back up,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan complied, and Phil pointed to a set of rings. \u201cWhat about those?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat, for wedding bands?\u201d Dan asked. The set was his and hers style, one being a silver ring with sapphires and a diamond, the other being a silver band with diamonds embedded and wrapping around it.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, maybe engagement ones,\u201d Phil said. \u201cDo you not like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Dan looked down, blushing a little. \u201cI already have one that I, uh, thought would be good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said, feeling warmth grow in his chest at that.</p><p>\u201cNot that I was planning anything special to do with it. We are engaged, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cYeah,\u201d he assured. \u201cWe are. I did propose, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cWe still calling that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it\u2019s a little more romantic than just talking about getting married sometimes,\u201d Phil argued.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s cozier,\u201d Dan admitted. \u201cAnd a bit less stressful.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cCan I see the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Tell me if it\u2019s trash, or whatever,\u201d Dan said, opening the safari app on his phone.</p><p>Phil looked at the ring.(<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/rings/cyorings/purchase_review/?did=1153325&amp;ucg=true&amp;sid=1152801\">link</a>)</p><p>It was simple enough, the setting was platinum, in an intertwined pattern, twisting into a design that seemed to be silver plant buds surrounding the gem in the middle. The gem was a sapphire, teal in color and cut round.</p><p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too girly, or whatever?\u201d Dan asked. It was a women\u2019s style ring, but the men\u2019s style engagement bands were so boring in comparison.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like it,\u201d Phil said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Did you pick one for yourself too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dingus, that\u2019s your job,\u201d Dan said. \u201cBut do be aware that if it doesn\u2019t compliment yours, I will be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said softly. \u201cAlright. No pressure.\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cPhil, you offered me a glove and I agreed to marry you, I don\u2019t think you should be too concerned.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d He leaned his head on Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat about the wedding bands?\u201d</p><p>Dan set his phone down. \u201cI think we should look at that once we have a plan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all figured out, wow,\u201d Phil said, yawning. \u201cThink I can help when we actually plan the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on if you have good ideas,\u201d Dan teased.</p><p>\u201cExcuse you. I have the most brilliant ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did agree to marry me, so I guess you can have good ideas sometimes,\u201d Dan said, settling down against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cSee, exactly,\u201d Phil agreed, leaning against Dan\u2019s shoulder again.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>October 2018</b></p><p>It had been a long few months, and a lot of hours of driving and flying and time to think. And it had been a lot of shows of meeting with fans, of hearing their thoughts, of having a real interaction with the people who watched their content and making more sense of the boundaries between an audience and the act. At some points in the tour, there were these deafening moments of realization. At some points, everything seemed much simpler.</p><p>Phil was worried that those moments would wash away as they returned back to business as usual. But they returned home, and things didn\u2019t change or revert.</p><p>It was even quieter at home, gave them even more time to just think, especially as they spent most of their first day back in bed. While Dan was asleep at a normal hour, Phil had woken up far too early from the jet-lag. He and Dan had to edit their film, had to try and get any opportunity they could to reach Brazil or Mexico with their tour, had to get back to work for a while, do spooky week, PINOF 10, and eventually something for Christmas, but after they didn\u2019t really have anything major planned yet in their professional lives.</p><p>Phil thought back to the beginning of the tour, to the end of 2017, their \u201clife stuff\u201d year. Thought about how much Dan\u2019s Pinterest board had filled up in the past few years. Thought about when Dan asked him to promise that they would finally do it after interactive introverts ended.</p><p>Phil had never been too invested in the idea of marriage. His brother hadn\u2019t gotten married to his serious, long term, girlfriend. His parents had more recently been quiet about their wants, though Phil knew his mother was probably holding out hope. He had never been desperate to get married, but he couldn\u2019t say he\u2019d never fantasized about it as a romantic and lonely teenager, at the beginning of his and Dan\u2019s relationship, as he and Dan started to relax into their domestic, committed, life. He\u2019d thought it impossible for so long, just a distant dream. He had been able to dull it down in his mind, come up with reasons it was impractical, or silly, or an outdated tradition. But with the option available, with Dan seeming so interested in it, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. He suddenly began wanting to write \u201chusband\u201d on medical paperwork, started to wish they got those silly words, those silly rings. He even started to fantasize about vows, about actually celebrating their love, their romantic love, in front of friends and family. And Phil knew Dan probably started to feel the same around the same time that all these feelings had surfaced for Phil.</p><p>Phil opened his phone\u2019s safari app, clicking on the page that had been favorited for a while. He already had his preferences set in, but he glanced them over again.</p><p>Phil smiled a little. He put it in his credit card information, and clicked checkout, purchasing the two rings.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>December 2018</b></p><p>Finally, the official Interactive Introverts DVD, as well as a Director\u2019s Commentary, was out of their hands, their work done. They continued to film videos between dreamful conversations about the next \u2018phase\u2019 of \u2018Dan and Phil\u2019 as a professional duo.</p><p>The slowing of their lives had left room for the sadness to sneak back into Dan\u2019s head, which made sense, seeing as this was much like a come down off of a high, but he was readjusting well. He got back into the swing of day to day domestic life with Phil and even began trying to pick up the healthy habits he\u2019d managed to beat into himself before the tour began.</p><p>Things were honestly really fucking good aside from the occasional overwhelm that could creep up on Dan when it came to the next move in his career. He had made a bargain with himself to stay off social media (for the most part), which was a bit harder than he had expected it to be, but overall helpful in his quest to rediscover who he was by himself rather than as an entertainer.</p><p>Christmas seemed to happen all at once. One day it was December 1st and the next they were in their rooms packing to visit Phil\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019ll spend Christmas together next year?\u201d Dan asked quietly, folding a t-shirt and setting it in his case. The question came up every year. It always felt odd to spend so much of their time together only to part for the holidays. Dan was spending a few days with Phil\u2019s family up North and returning to his hometown just in time for Christmas Day, but it was still strange to him that the two of them weren\u2019t able to be together on Christmas Day. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Phil said. \u201cIt\u2019s just tough getting our families together, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, as he always did in reply.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan agreed with a soft sigh, knowing there was nothing that could be done about it tonight. \u201cYou know, this won\u2019t fly when we\u2019re married,\u201d he said, lacing his tone with humor that was just a little forced.</p><p>Phil smiled in a sad sort of way. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure it out by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so far away,\u201d Dan said softly. Sometimes this stupid marriage thing felt like a dream where as soon as they got close to it, it moved further away.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan, frowning a little.</p><p>Dan sighed. \u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just the holidays, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always feels weird to not, like\u2026you know, be a family around Christmas.\u201d He didn\u2019t look over at Phil as he shoved pairs of socks into the pocket of his suitcase.</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes were on Dan, however. He thought of the small box containing two rings that were hidden away in the flat, somewhere Dan wouldn\u2019t stumble upon it. Maybe he should have gotten it. Should have given it to Dan right then as a reassurance of his intentions. Maybe he should have gone and grabbed it so they could bring it up North with them and he could give it to Dan there.</p><p>It was Christmas, though. And Dan and Phil were going to Phil\u2019s parents, and then Dan to his. Though Dan and Phil liked to think of themselves as already engaged, the rings would look and feel like a proposal, a more official one than the few they had shared. They deserved to have that moment by itself with nothing else to take from it.</p><p>Dan was folding his clothing a bit faster now, shoving it into his case a bit harder, his jaw tense.</p><p>Phil sat on the bed. \u201cDan,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Dan paused and looked over at Phil.</p><p>\u201cNext year,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better make good on that, Lester,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI always keep my promises,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cDebatable,\u201d Dan answered with a small grin.</p><p>Phil threw a pair of underwear at Dan. \u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned wider. \u201cOh, you do, do you? Hmm, let\u2019s see. \u2018Oh, Dan, I won\u2019t leave the cupboard door opens anymore, promise,\u2019 or\u2014\u201d Phil threw another item of clothing at him and Dan giggled. \u201c\u2014or \u2018oh, Dan, if you get the post today, I\u2019ll do it next time I promi\u2014\u201d Dan was cut off when a pillow hit him in the face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst and I hate you,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan just grinned. \u201cWell you promised to marry me, so sucks to suck,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Phil agreed with a smile. \u201cPick up those clothes,\u201d Phil said, motioning to the clothes on the floor by Dan.</p><p>\u201cOh, the clothes you threw onto the floor, sure yeah,\u201d Dan said, throwing a pair of underwear at Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Dan mentioned, and it sounded a bit more sincere than Phil would have expected.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Phil answered.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>February 2019</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were walking down the same path by the beach again. Phil\u2019s birthday had been lovely, as usual. It was cozy and in the company of family, and all in all a nice time. Dan enjoyed the seclusion of the Lesters\u2019 home even more than the times before today. They were enjoying being just them.</p><p>The last few years had been spent learning how to comfortably open themselves up. Now, they had an idea of where they were going career-wise and in the eyes of the public. The fear was gone. Or at least dulled a bit. And with no fear creating a wall between Dan and Phil and the eyes that watched them, it was time to relearn which moments not to share, which moments would just be theirs. Dan himself had decided to just be his for a while. So, it went without saying that this trip was theirs.</p><p>Last year, walking down this path, they thought about how they were basically a year into being engaged. They\u2019d talked about the year they were embarking on. A World Tour. There was no time for life plans, and they didn\u2019t mind it as much as they had expected. For a year, the Dan and Phil of everyday life were the same as Entertainer Dan and Phil. Most of the time, Entertainer Dan and Phil is what Dan and Phil wanted to be. And so, they loved it. They loved standing in front of people who adored them for reasons Dan and Phil didn\u2019t always understand, hearing rooms of people laugh because of something they said, meeting people who said that Dan and Phil made them happy, made them feel safe, gave them a community. They loved this family. Their family was this huge, messy, family of people who watched their content to be entertained and the two weirdos who created said content.</p><p>This year, they walked down the path, they thought about how they were basically two years engaged. They realized that they were back to a family of two again. Entertainer and everyday life had to find a balance again. They were home. They had time for life stuff. Dan wanted that life stuff more than he ever had before, and he knew Phil wanted it to.</p><p>Phil turned to the right and Dan followed as he walked down onto the beach, sitting on the sand. Dan didn\u2019t say anything, sitting beside him. The silence laid over them like a blanket, and Dan wasn\u2019t ready to peak his head out yet. It was comforting to be with someone without feeling the need to perform, to talk, to be interesting. Dan supposed that was one of the reasons he and Phil worked so well. Neither of them ever had to be interesting around each other. They could go for hours just listening to one and other breathe, or, as Phil was doing, taking in the way the other looked.</p><p>Dan looked out to the ocean, but Phil knew he could tell Phil was looking at him. Their eyes on one and other felt normal, comforting. They quite liked to look at each other. And Phil was quite liking looking at Dan as it was. Dan\u2019s hood was down, and his hair was a mess of curls, the wind playing with it, tangling it. When they returned to the house, Phil would run his fingers through it and untangle it. His cheeks were flushed pink from the cold, the one spot on his cheek almost red.</p><p>Phil gripped the box in his coat pocket with his left hand and took in a breath.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Dan looked over. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s for me too,\u201d he said. He pulled the box out of his pocket and set it on the beach between them. Phil could tell the second Dan realized. He flicked his eyes up to meet Phil\u2019s, almost hesitant.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Phil murmured.</p><p>Dan bit his lip, reaching out his left hand to take the lid off the box. He held his breath, letting it out all at once when he saw the two rings. He\u2019d seen one before, on a LED screen, after spending hours picking it out for Phil. The other was new. It was gorgeous. It complimented the one Dan had picked out for Phil. The intertwining ring setting ended in leaves which surrounded a dark jewel. (<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/custom-rings/Solitaire-Leaf-Ring-1154259/\">link</a>)</p><p>Dan felt tears well in his eyes. It was strange how two shiny pieces of jewelry could make so much emotion well in Dan\u2019s chest.</p><p>Phil watched Dan\u2019s reaction, smiling a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014uh,\u201d Dan started, going to touch one of the rings. \u201cThat one\u2019s mine?\u201d</p><p>Phil reached to grab the ring from the box. He held it between his fingers and offered it out. \u201cCan I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Dan replied, voice barely a breath. He held out his left hand for Phil. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was shaking due to the emotion, the cold air, or a combination of both. Phil slid the engagement ring onto Dan\u2019s ring finger and Dan felt tears leak from the sides of his eyes as he watched it take its place resting snugly at the base of Dan\u2019s previously naked ring finger. Dan held his hand out, looking at it. He choked on a sob, laughing a little at the silliness of the overwhelming emotion. \u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI want to start planning our wedding,\u201d Phil said, and Dan had been aching to ask the same of Phil. Christmas and Phil\u2019s birthday and work had stopped him, but he was so glad Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Dan said, voice broken with the emotion. He moved the box aside and moved closer, leaning in to hug Phil tightly, burying his face in Phil\u2019s neck, shoving off the hood he wore. \u00a0</p><p>Phil held Dan back just as tightly, and they breathed each other in, held each other close, let the reality of the words Phil had just spoken sink in. Phil breathed out shakily, holding Dan a bit tighter, feeling tears well in his own eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan answered, laughing through his tears. \u201cFor real this time.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed a little too. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. He pulled back to look him in the eyes. \u201cFor real. As soon as we get home, I want to find a venue. We\u2019re going to book a date.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled, a few tears slipping down his cheeks. \u201cWait,\u201d he realized, sniffling a little. \u201cLet me\u2013\u201d He reached to grab the box, taking out the ring he had picked out for Phil months and months ago. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled, himself sniffling a bit as he offered his left hand to Dan. Dan slid the ring onto Phil\u2019s ring finger. He compared their two left hands. \u201cThere. We match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled, looking down at his engagement ring. \u201cI never want to take this off,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have everything worked out. In fact, they didn\u2019t have much of anything worked out. They didn\u2019t know how they were going to manage their marriage and engagement publicly. They didn\u2019t know if they would announce it or lead up to it or quietly allow it to happen without much conversation by them. They didn\u2019t know if they would have to take the ring off when they sat in front of cameras and for how long. No doubt they would spend hours and hours talking it through and asking advice and getting unsure and frustrated.</p><p>But none of that mattered because this was the first step. And Dan and Phil were definitely going to book that venue. Dan was thinking of April next year. Phil was picturing Dan in an over-the-top white suit. Dan was thinking about writing vows. Phil was wondering about wedding bands. The two of them were getting married.</p><p>So, for now, Phil said, \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p>",

He had videos to film. He had growing up to do, things to learn, a plan to figure out, YouTube projects to begin. He had a family to disappoint, and fans to entertain, and a boyfriend to try to be the best version of himself for.</p><p>But in the soft, drunken, afterglow, everything seemed easy. They weren\u2019t asleep, for some reason, just laying, naked limbs tangled together despite the sweat. Phil\u2019s hair tickled Dan\u2019s neck, and it\u2019d been nearly two years, and Dan sort of thought this was the end game. Though, he\u2019d sort of thought that since the day he saw Phil\u2019s blue eyes in person rather than through a fuzzy webcam.</p><p>But at first it was fiery and intense and new, and Dan was afraid it might burn out too quickly for his liking. But then the fiery newness started to go away, and nothing felt empty. That was probably when Dan knew.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>It was a scarily naive thought. The decisive thought Dan and Phil would work. Professionally. Publicly. Romantically. Quietly. Indefinitely. But he believed it.</p><p>Youtube could lose relevance tomorrow. The worst of Dan could get the better of him. Dan and Phil could grow and change in ways that weren\u2019t so compatible. Phil could tell Dan he wanted to take time apart to grow and develop as people. All these things were perfectly able to happen. In fact, it was\u00a0almost likely. But, as Dan laid in the presence of the first and only man he\u2019d ever loved, and the only man he could ever see himself loving, he knew none of those things would happen. It was a very rare moment for Dan to feel entirely confident and certain in himself, his career, his relationship. But then and there he was.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d Dan breathed.</p><p>The words didn\u2019t hold any weight. They both knew it. The sad truth was that at the moment they couldn\u2019t, even if they were ready for such a commitment. Still, he said them. Because if they were a girl and a guy and this was a romantic comedy, instead of being two irrelevant young men enjoying a single moment of peace in an insane world, the words would mean something. And, before tonight, saying anything like them would have felt far scarier. The thoughts behind them were there. The \u201cif we could, I would.\u201d So, Dan would pretend for tonight that these words did mean something.</p><p>Dan felt the rumble of Phil\u2019s chest, their skin pressed together, before he heard the chuckle. \u201cM'kay,\u201d he said easily.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Dan replied with a soft giggle.</p><p>\u201cGay marriage isn\u2019t legal,\u201d Phil mentioned, voice quiet and deeper than it would be if they were fully awake, fully sober, and not in private.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d Dan replied, his own words a bit slurred with sleepiness. \u201cWe can go to, like, California and find a liberal courthouse and a socialist priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d Phil mentioned. \u201cWe could do one of those, like, civil partnership things,\u201d Phil said, as though he\u2019d looked into it. \u201cGives us the benefits and\u2014\u201d He yawned. \u201cWe could even have a party for it.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned a little at that, at the idea that Phil seemed to have looked into how they could stay together in the future. \u201cFuck that,\u201d he replied anyway. \u201cI want a husband.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned back. \u201cPeople\u2019ll come to their senses eventually,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll still be around when they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so?\u201d Dan asked, moving further into him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, yawning again. \u201cThen I\u2019ll marry you, Howell,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cM'kay,\u201d Dan replied softly, yawning as well.</p><p>The morning brought no further comment on it, though it definitely wasn\u2019t forgotten. They kept tentative eyes on the news when the gay marriage \u201cdebate\u201d was brought up. How couldn\u2019t they? \u00a0</p><p>And Dan moved in with Phil. And their popularity grew. And Dan began thinking that the naive thoughts he had about the future might actually come to pass.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>June 2012</b></p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Phil said, alcohol on his breath.</p><p>\u201cMmm, yes?\u201d Dan asked, trying his hardest to focus on looking Phil in the eyes. They\u2019d had way too much to drink tonight and there wasn\u2019t a single part of him that could see himself regretting it, except that he might\u2019ve ruined the conclusion to today\u2019s vlog. Fuck it. They were in Vegas. It was Dan\u2019s birthday. Sue him.</p><p>Well, it was his late birthday celebration, but he was away with his boyfriend, legally allowed to drink in the states, and giddy on being in love and having an expensive hotel room. It was like back when they were in Jamaica. But with more alcohol and less scenery. So, he was going to enjoy himself a little too much. They both were.</p><p>\u201cYou know how in Friends\u2014\u201d Phil started.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked, lost.</p><p>\u201cFriends! The TV show,\u201d Phil replied, \u201cYou know with the: <i>so, no one told you life was gonna be this way,</i>\u201d he sang to the tune of the opening theme for friends, a slur in his voice. He proceeded to clap five times in quick succession.</p><p>Dan blinked, remembering the show. \u201cOh yeah! We should watch that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Shut up. But you know how in Friends they go to Vegas?\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan replied, not sure he did actually remember. He leaned into Phil, who was somehow not so drunk they both fell over. He just wrapped an arm around Dan and looked him in the eyes, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAnd then Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel all decided to get married?\u201d he continued.</p><p>Dan frowned, trying to make his brain think of more things than just \u2018<i>Phil</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>lean in and kiss</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>smells like rum and coke and those stupid fruity drinks that are for probably meant for girls but fuck it</i>.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWait, they all got married?\u201d Dan asked, frowning as he thought (or attempted to).</p><p>\u201cNo, Ross and Rachel got married. And Monica and Chandler were gonna get married,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s Monica again?\u201d</p><p>Phil gently pushed him away, and Dan still stumbled, reaching to grip Phil\u2019s arm and steady himself. \u201cI\u2019m making you watch these with me when we get home,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cWait, okay, so they got married,\u201d Dan said, straightening up a bit.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, reaching for Dan\u2019s wrist. \u201c\u2018Cause you can just elope in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Dan took his hand, leaning in and pecking him on the lips. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying we should elope,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, kissing him again. \u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re drunnnk,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019re you, fuck\u2019off,\u201d Phil whined in reply. \u201cWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan laughed loudly. \u201cI think marriage licenses work differently than that,\u201d he theorized.</p><p>Phil shrugged, pulling Dan closer to him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well. We could get married,\u201d Dan said, pecking Phil on the lips. \u201cBut then we\u2019d have to leave this perfectly good hotel room and the perfectly good hotel bed,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather fuck me than marry me, I see how it is,\u201d Phil said frowning.</p><p>Dan giggled, kissing Phil on the lips again. \u201cS\u2019my birthday so you have to do what I say,\u201d Dan said decisively.</p><p>\u201cYour birthday was like two weeks ago,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cOkay compromise,\u201d Dan said. \u201cWe fuck tonight, and get married tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>Phil thought on this for a moment. \u201cDeal,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>Dan kissed him again, this time longer and messier. \u201cWait,\u201d he breathed, pulling back. \u201cBefore we do the sex thing, I have to go be sick,\u201d he said, tapping Phil on the nose and giving a wink before walking into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHot,\u201d Phil called after him sarcastically.</p><p>Morning would bring hangovers and chuckles and jokes about eloping. It would bring too real thoughts about spending forever together. It would bring too real hopes that they would be able to get married one day, with a proper ceremony and reception, back in the country they grew up in, the country they met in. \u00a0</p><p>Then they would force themselves out of bed, film the rest of their vlog, and enjoy their final day of vacation in Vegas before they had to return home to real life.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>July 2013</b></p><p>Dan and Phil both watched the rainbow flags waving on the television, soft smiles on their faces. The headline read that the queen had voted queer. She had given her royal assent and the bill finally been passed to begin allowing same-sex marriage. The news reporters spoke about the first marriages probably taking place next summer. Dan felt that this had been a long time coming.</p><p>Dan had sort of imagined he\u2019d lost the privilege of marriage when he fell in love with a man. Part of him knew that one day he\u2019d be allowed to marry, though, and that day would come sooner now.</p><p>Right now, he didn\u2019t need marriage to be happy. He knew Phil felt the same way. They were in love, committed, recovering from a rough patch in their relationship, and focused heavily on their careers.</p><p>Still, they each knew as they moved closer to one and other, soft smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes as they watched the rainbow flags and the happy couples on the screen, that they wanted this one day. That the cheesy normal romance wasn\u2019t out of the picture. Dan held Phil\u2019s hand and they didn\u2019t speak, but they still heard one and other.</p><p>For a moment they allowed themselves to feel pride for who they were and how they loved one and other, and they allowed themselves to imagine a day in the distant future where they maybe no longer felt the need to hide. Where they maybe wore rings on their fingers. Maybe even shared a last name.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>March 2014</b></p><p>The next year and Dan had his laptop on his lap, open to a word document with messily organized ideas, a million tabs open on google about book publishing. They hadn\u2019t even decided if they were going to do this yet, but Dan was taken with the idea already. Phil could probably tell by his research.</p><p>There was a bit of wine in their systems and the ambiance of a simple afternoon in. Starting with a silly idea and some giggling, they had now filled two pages with ideas. Dan had never been more ready for anything. He hoped the motivation didn\u2019t slip away before they could actually do this.</p><p>Phil read a headline on his phone and smiled softly before flipping on the news. He sat beside Dan as the screen lit up with the happy faces of gay couples piling into courthouses to sign wedding licenses.</p><p>Phil sat beside Dan and leaned against him. Dan looked up and smiled.</p><p>\u201cThink we should head over?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cDan and Phil spotted eloping in a London courthouse,\u201d Phil replied. \u201cWe\u2019d be on trending for sure.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled. \u201cWell, we missed the chance to be the first so, might as well wait I guess,\u201d Dan said with a sigh. \u201cIf the gaming channel fails, we\u2019ll call that plan B,\u201d Dan joked.</p><p>Phil chuckled. \u201cMaybe next year,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling into Dan\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Things were almost only looking up for the two of them. Popularity, working for BBC, working with charity, Dan\u2019s recovery plan when it came to his mental health, Dan and Phil\u2019s relaxation of their boundaries around their relationship when it came to viewers. Every day was spent together, they were discussing huge projects and undertakings, they were making videos, they were generally just working on being so happy, and they were both pretty sure the general level of happiness in their life as partners (in business, in love, in life) would only rise as the years went on.</p><p>So maybe next year, if they could find the time.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>April 2015</b></p><p>They were in Japan. They\u2019d been in Japan for a few days, and they were standing on the balcony of their hotel room, looking out at the lights of the city. Something about being in exotic places was insanely romantic. Dan and Phil had been wanting to come here for ages.</p><p>This had been sort of crazy for them. They hadn\u2019t really done something so spontaneous since they had first met, but they\u2019d realized that they could do it. Money wasn\u2019t an issue, they had the time, and they could say they were doing it for their book. Still, when the cameras were off, Dan described it as their romantic getaway and Phil just giggled and went along.</p><p>It was hilarious to Dan that it sort of felt like a honeymoon. They\u2019d taken vacations together before, Jamaica came to mind, but it was never just them. Never just a romantic getaway. There was always something else to do.</p><p>Dan\u2019s arms were around Phil as they stood, looking out at the cityscape. They\u2019d gotten back to the hotel rather late and both of them were exhausted, but there was still a residual giddiness from the loveliness of the day keeping them awake.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get married,\u201d Phil said with a hum. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled. \u201cIn Japan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cYeah. Just like elope. We don\u2019t have to tell anyone,\u201d he murmured, turning his head to look at Dan.</p><p>\u201cGay marriage isn\u2019t legal here,\u201d Dan mentioned, leaving out the fact that they were foreigners and therefore probably couldn\u2019t actually get married in a different country.</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI always forget we\u2019re a gay couple.\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking weird,\u201d he said. \u201cI love being here, though,\u201d Dan dropped a kiss to Phil\u2019s neck. \u201cWith you,\u201d he added. \u201cIt just, feels so freeing, to be somewhere they don\u2019t really know \u2018Dan and Phil,\u2019 so we can just, like, be Dan and Phil,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil breathed, leaning back into Dan. \u201cI wish we could stay forever.\u201d</p><p>They looked out at the lights. God, it was romantic. They were far from London and their beds and the sofa, but Dan felt right at home there, resting his chin on Phil\u2019s shoulder and taking in the easy intimacy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u202fshould\u202fget married,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan replied. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the tour, the book, we\u2019ll be set after this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could even throw a fancy expensive wedding.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled and hummed thoughtfully. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the tour,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a place to live, though. A long-term place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Dan agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll do that after the tour too then. 2015 is planning. 2016 is tour. 2017 will just be us,\u201d Dan said. \u201cLife stuff. You and me stuff.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cSounds good,\u201d he admitted. \u201c2017\u2019s so far, though,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan looked over at Phil, his eyes reflecting the light of the moon and the city. \u201cIt just gives us time to get there,\u201d Dan said. \u201cThese are going to be the best years of our lives,\u201d Dan decided.</p><p>Phil smiled because he knew it was true. They were doing everything they never dreamed they would be able to do. Big creative projects, performances, presenting truer and more real versions of themselves to the world, growing into the people they were always meant to be, watching their relationship mature into the beautiful, committed, healthy relationship that it was always getting better at being.</p><p>\u201cI knew when I met you these would be the best years of my life,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Dan replied, chuckling. \u201cYou probably thought we\u2019d forget about each other after a few months.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled. \u201cMaybe at first, but when we were in my bedroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked me and then knew it was true love?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil elbowed him in the stomach. \u201cShut up,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI actually hate you.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned, holding Phil tighter against him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I meant. When you were actually there in person, and we just\u202fworked\u202fand I never wanted you to leave, you know? I wasn\u2019t like, \u2018yeah this is who I\u2019m gonna marry,\u2019\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018yeah this guy\u2019s gonna give me some of the best times of my life.\u2019 I definitely wasn\u2019t wrong,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan grinned, squeezing his arms around Phil. \u201cI\u2019m, like, extremely, madly, in love with you, you know,\u201d he mentioned.</p><p>\u201cYeah I know,\u201d Phil replied. He finally turned around in Dan\u2019s arms to look Dan in the eyes. \u201cI think you\u2019re the guy I\u2019m gonna marry,\u201d he decided.</p><p>Dan nodded thoughtfully. \u201cYeah. That might be cool,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Phil grinned and leaned in to kiss Dan on the lips. One of those smiling kisses where it wasn\u2019t quite effective because they were smiling too much, but the thought was there.</p><p>Dan wrapped his arms around Phil, kissing him properly. They had two days left in the beautiful, exotic, vacation, and they were sure as hell going to make the most of them.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>February 2017</b></p><p>Some days, the prospect of marriage didn\u2019t feel so close or so comfy. Some days it was the furthest thing from their minds. Some days, it was a scary sort of change that they didn\u2019t want to confront. Some days it was a desire hanging over them, reminding them that they were sort of missing something, but not providing any sort of way to get there.</p><p>Dan and Phil hadn\u2019t had two seconds to breathe once the tour started. Between the documentary filming, the performing, trying to continue to post videos, and being tourists, they had been fully drained. They had collapsed beside each other each night, content, fulfilled but exhausted. Eventually, the shows ran out and they returned home. They released their movie, the story of TATINOF, and then all of a sudden everything slowed down. They had done it. Done a Dan and Phil book and tour. Immortalized themselves, in a way.</p><p>And, now, suddenly, they had time. Time to think. Time to feel. Time to talk.</p><p>Dan tagged along to see Phil\u2019s family on Phil\u2019s birthday. His thirtieth. In some ways it felt like Dan and Phil were both just kids when they met and then almost overnight, they were these actual adults with semi-functioning lives. And now Phil was turning thirty. Thirty years of life. Eight of those years with Dan.</p><p>It felt like it was time for something. Something more. Maybe it wasn\u2019t exactly time, but it was getting much closer.</p><p>Phil was pretty sure he knew exactly what that something was when he and Dan were walking over the grassy hills by the beach on the Isle of Man with Martyn and Cornelia and Phil\u2019s parents. When Dan slipped down after stepping on an overhang, cursing. When there was a brief moment of concern before Phil started laughing. When he climbed down a bit more carefully and offered Dan a hand.</p><p>And when Phil captured the moment for Dan\u2019s Instagram as he deemed the occurrence very on brand.</p><p>They did sort of want everyone to know that they were up here visiting Phil\u2019s family together. To stop the questions that would no doubt be running through the fan\u2019s\u2019 minds, maybe. Maybe just to show off a little. Maybe as a step further out of \u2018the closet,\u2019 a term they had both sort-of grown to dislike.</p><p>And Phil knew again when Dan was laughing and making jokes with Phil\u2019s family like it was second nature. When Dan volunteered to help Kath in the kitchen and when Dan crawled up to lay his head against Phil\u2019s shoulder on the couch when he\u2019d finished. When they crawled into bed later that night and Phil thought about how strange it was that they hadn\u2019t spent Christmas together.</p><p>The next day, they got up early, beat Phil\u2019s mum even, and left a note on the counter saying they had gone off on a walk. Sappy as shit, but Phil knew his mother would smile. Perhaps while rolling her eyes.</p><p>The paths here were lovely to walk down, the area small. It felt a bit like a little corner of the world where no one else could see them. Where they were hidden away, untouchable.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Phil murmured, his voice quiet as he held his phone camera up. He and Dan had always loved photos. Capturing moments to come back to later.</p><p>Dan smiled looking over at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look cute,\u201d he said. His voice was soft, coated in fondness. \u201cFor Instagram. Maybe,\u201d Phil replied.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Phil said, knowing what Dan meant.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right time for this conversation, but Phil was never a patient man.</p><p>\u201cI want them to know you\u2019re here with me,\u201d he said softly. He wanted everyone to know, really.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan answered. \u201cMe too.\u201d Dan shoved his hands back into his pockets, dimple popping even with just the slight smile he wore.</p><p>They continued walking and Phil tried to sort out his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he said before he had the chance.</p><p>Phil supposed that if they were another couple, Dan might\u2019ve looked up in surprise. That Dan might have grinned and cried and said \u2018yes, yes, yes\u2019 over and over. As it was, they were Dan and Phil, and this was not the first time the words had slipped past one of their lips.</p><p>So, Dan smiled a bit more, looking over at Phil. He pulled his hand from his pocket, offering it to Phil.</p><p>They didn\u2019t do that. Normally. But Phil was starting to think that they were going to begin redefining their normal. So, on the empty stretch of beach, Phil took Dan\u2019s hand. No one was around. Dan and Phil were the only two people in the world right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>Phil realized that if Dan had simply said yes, he would have been happy. He knew that they would have come into roadblocks, though. They would have to postpone.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked over at him. He smiled again, tugging Phil after him and down one of the grassy hills and toward the water. The ground was wet with the early-morning frost, but Dan sat down on the sand, gesturing for Phil to do the same. The two looked out at the ocean.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you want me to,\u201d Dan said quietly.</p><p>Phil was surprised by that, looking over at Dan. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d marry you tomorrow if we had a plan ready tonight,\u201d Dan said, looking at his left hand. At the finger that sometimes, like now, looked naked.</p><p>\u201cI wish it was that easy sometimes,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will get married though, won\u2019t we? Soon?\u201d Phil asked. \u00a0</p><p>There was a longing to his voice. A longing for the future that was he had wanted to be here by now. Phil wanted to get married. Wanted to have that silly domestic bliss. Still, he knew that he and Dan weren\u2019t entirely ready, despite their ages, their financial comfort, and the family and friends watching them to see when they would. They would know when they were truly ready. They would build up to it. That was what they did. Sink into it, adjust to it. Maybe it was caution. Maybe they just wanted to savor the journey.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan answered. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time, we\u2019ll know,\u201d he said. Dan had the habit of knowing just what Phil was thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re not the spontaneity type, anyways, are we?\u201d He looked out at the ocean. The serenity of waves lapping up against the sand. The cool wind stung his cheeks and he\u2019d pulled away his hand to bury it in his pocket where it was warmer.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>Dan looked over at him.</p><p>\u201cCan we be engaged?\u201d Phil asked, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand.</p><p>Dan sort of felt like they already were, but a little clarification never hurt. This felt like Phil saying that he wanted to speed things up, just a little. Wanted to bring this dream a little closer to them. Dan and Phil never really got a proposal, at least not a dramatic and life-changing one, so Dan grinned.</p><p>\u201cAre you proposing to me, Phil Lester?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShould I get on one knee?\u201d Phil asked, also grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even got a ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cSome people get extravagant romantic date proposals with rose petals and\u2014\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Phil shoved Dan, pouting and Dan giggled.</p><p>\u201c\u2014champagne, and diamond rings, and long emotional speeches, and\u2014\u201d He was laughing too hard now as Phil punched him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Dan, fine, hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, what are you gonna do?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil just grinned, looking around and patting his pockets. He reached into his coat pocket. Pulling out a glove, he seemed to make a decision. He looked at Dan and grinned, getting on one knee, offering up the glove.</p><p>\u201cDaniel Howell,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not have a ring, but that\u2019s just another decision that you and me can make together. So please accept this glove as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you even get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum sent me out with them yesterday, now shush.\u201d He cleared his throat again. \u201cDaniel James Howell. We\u2019re up here visiting my family, and it always feels so right to have you here as well. I think I\u2019m lucky enough that I get to have my family wherever I am because you are my family. You\u2019re my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Phil\u2026\u201d Dan said, smiling at the silliness of it, but also feeling tears gather. He hadn\u2019t been expecting to actually get emotional.</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re my best friend and my family and my partner in, like, everything that I do. I love that. I want to celebrate that in every way in the world. I want you to be right here with me forever. I want to make endless memories with you. I wanna promise you that I love you forever and ever and ever. So, if you will please accept this glove, which I spent my whole life savings on, and let me know. Will you marry me? Be my fianc\u00e9, then, when we figure it out, my husband?\u201d Phil was beaming at Dan, his eyes sparkling, holding out a goddamn glove, and they were so stupid, but Dan loved it so much.</p><p>Dan knew they were going to get married. He had always known, but somehow hearing it like this felt different. It felt real. It felt tangible. He couldn\u2019t help that tears were starting to slip down his cheeks. He giggled. \u201cYes,\u201d he said through his giggles and sniffles. \u201cOf course.\u201d He offered his left hand.</p><p>Phil grinned, sliding the winter mitten, with some difficulty, onto Dan\u2019s hand. Dan held his hand up and looked at it. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Phil retorted.</p><p>\u201cCome here, you fucking nerd,\u201d Dan said, still cry-laughing a little.</p><p>Phil stood and offered a hand to Dan. He pulled Dan up and smiled at him, bringing a hand to his cheek to wipe away tears with his thumb. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tell your mum we\u2019ve gotten officially engaged, though,\u201d Dan mentioned. \u201cIt\u2019ll ruin your whole birthday month.\u201d</p><p>Phil just grinned and kissed Dan again. \u201cHere,\u201d he murmured, handing Dan the other glove. \u201cIt\u2019s a matching set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent two of your whole life savings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d Dan giggled. \u201cGod, you\u2019re such a fucking twat. Fucking engagement glove.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned, absolutely pleased with himself. \u201cI was actually going to grab the first rock I saw, but I thought I\u2019d use something you could actually wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfffft,\u201d Dan breathed. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing though,\u201d Phil said, grinning. \u201cWhy should love and commitment need to be represented by material items? I mean, who even\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan cut Phil off by pressing his lips to Phil\u2019s. \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he breathed, pulling back. \u201cI want a ring.\u201d</p><p>Phil just grinned some more. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he murmured, looking over Dan. \u201cLet me take a picture of you.\u201d He looked stupidly adorable in his hat, cheeks flushed from the cold, eyes just a little watery from the emotion. He looked so happy.</p><p>Dan chuckled but complied. (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQBNr4Ujx_3/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\">link</a>)</p><p>And when they returned to the house, and Kath asked how their walk was, they shared a glance and a smile between themselves and simply said it was lovely.\u00a0</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>May 2017</b></p><p>\u201cOh my God, no,\u201d Phil said between giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Dan asked, giggling himself.</p><p>Phil shoved Dan. \u201cWedding rings are supposed to represent eternal love, not be a goth fashion statement,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan pouted, moving back to sit against the headboard. Phil leaned his head against his shoulder again, and Dan smiled a little. Phil looked back down at Dan\u2019s phone.</p><p>The two of them were sat in bed having a lazy day. Things in the new flat still needed unpacking and neither of them had eaten anything but takeaway in about a week, but they were exhausted, so they were in bed. \u00a0</p><p>Dan was scrolling through Pinterest wedding bands that cost way too much because the tour was over, they\u2019d become engaged, they were moving, Dan was planning a lot of change with his YouTube, and even though he\u2019d now realized 2017 was far too busy without any plan of marriage, he knew it would be coming up in the next few years. He hoped it would. And he was impatient, and he liked to fantasize.</p><p>Dan clicked on a suggested image of the ring beside another similar ring. \u201cBut, look, they have matching ones, we could be aesthetic husbands,\u201d Dan said, grinning as he looked over to see Phil\u2019s expression.</p><p>Phil was unimpressed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, is black the most romantic of colors?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBlack is the only acceptable color,\u201d Dan replied.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see a black ring on someone\u2019s finger and think they\u2019re married, you just think they\u2019re some sad edgy person,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cBut I am some sad edgy person,\u201d Dan argued.</p><p>\u201cYeah but\u2026I\u2026Well, I\u2019m not,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying my wedding ring shouldn\u2019t be true to myself?\u201d Dan teased, climbing over Phil in a way that had become a little smoother over the years, and sitting atop his thighs.</p><p>Phil grinned, looking up at Dan. \u201cI definitely think it should,\u201d he said. He took Dan\u2019s left hand, looking at it. \u201cSo maybe something gold, hm? Maybe with some diamonds, I dunno. That\u2019s more you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He looked back up at Dan. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Dan looked affronted, \u201cDo you know me at all?\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned. \u201cBetter than you know yourself, Danny boy,\u201d he replied, leaning forward and kissing Dan on the lips.</p><p>Dan\u2019s lips twitched up, face remaining close to Phil\u2019s. \u201cMaybe silver.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed him again. \u201cMaybe the engagement ring can be black, or grey. With diamonds and sapphire.\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cOh, so you actually are getting me an engagement ring, are you?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m getting you one too then,\u201d Dan decided. \u201cBut we probably shouldn\u2019t make it a surprise, because we have to coordinate.\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to go on another tour with all this talk, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you we should\u2019ve eloped in Vegas during tatinof,\u201d Dan said with a sigh.</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again, rolling him over to kiss him properly, the two of them giggling.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>March 2018</b></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going on tour again,\u201d Dan said with a pout, head leaning against Phil\u2019s shoulder as he looked through wedding Pinterest boards, an activity that had started as a distant, somewhat joke of a dream in 2015 upon seeing a suit that Dan could just perfectly imagine walking down an aisle wearing and needing to save it. It had evolved into a more frequent activity and saving posts to his board called \u201csoon \ud83d\udc8d.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d returned from today\u2019s rehearsals and promptly collapsed on the couch together, Dan absently opening Pinterest and being bombarded by posts for wedding planning, seeing as he\u2019d only really gotten the Pinterest to save the stuff he wanted to remember for when they finally did do what they\u2019d been quietly planning with each other.</p><p>\u201cIt was your idea,\u201d Phil replied, fingers absently stroking Dan\u2019s arm as he looked at his own phone.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan said, still pouting. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be amazing,\u201d he said.</p><p>Phil smiled, looking over at Dan, noticing what he was doing on his phone. Phil\u2019s smile fell a little.</p><p>\u201cOne more hurrah, right?\u201d Phil murmured. \u201cGo out, see the world, meet all the people who support us, give a real show, a more \u2018us\u2019 show. Like you said. Then,\u201d Phil kissed the top of Dan\u2019s head. \u201cThen, we\u2019ll do some more \u2018us\u2019 things, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d Everything the two of them did was an \u2018us\u2019 thing.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Phil murmured, and Dan did. He didn\u2019t just mean them. He meant them in the romantic sense and in the life sense.</p><p>Dan sat up, shifting to look at Phil. \u201cAnd what\u2019s next for \u2018us,\u2019 Phil Lester? What\u2019s the official list?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cSo, the official list that we\u2019ve both been unofficially making together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Phil suppressed his grin as he replied. \u201cAlright. Well, of course, a forever home, right? Buy our own place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Dan agreed. \u201cObviously. Get that one in the works. What else?\u201d he asked, looking Phil in the eyes, grinning himself.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Phil replied, plucking Dan\u2019s phone up off the couch, still open to a picture of a wedding cake. \u201cMarry me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dan smiled at the words. <i>Marry me</i>.</p><p>Perhaps it had lost its intense, romantic, sound. Perhaps that was okay. It didn\u2019t sound like a proposal. Now, it sounded like a promise. It sounded like home. Like the next item on their list. It wasn\u2019t a crazy, romantic, spontaneous, idea. It was the thing they\u2019d been dying to relax into for so long.</p><p>Dan grinned. \u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed, leaning to kiss Phil softly on the lips. \u201cNo more putting it off? I\u2019m tired of being a fianc\u00e9,\u201d he said softly. \u201cA guy needs to level up. When we get home again, after the tour, are we gonna figure things out? Actually, do it?\u201d</p><p>Phil reached to push his curls from his forehead. \u201cYes. I honestly don\u2019t think I can wait too much longer,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Dan replied moving into Phil\u2019s side and wrapping his arms around his waist, leaning against him. \u201cPromise?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Dan hummed. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, pulling back to look Phil in the eyes. \u201cI wanna be your husband.\u201d</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>July 2018</b></p><p>It was a late night in a hotel room in the states. Dan was sat against the headboard, occasionally grabbing a chip from their mostly-eaten room service dinner. Phil had crawled up next to him and sat beside him, shoulders and legs pressed together. Nothing had really brought upon the subject. Phil had glanced over at Dan\u2019s phone to find Pinterest wedding boards again. Phil was never sure if he was dreaming wistfully about the future or if he just opened Pinterest when he was bored and thought \u2018that\u2019s a cool wedding cake idea, save that for the future\u2019 and then got pulled into a vortex of aesthetically pleasing table-settings, bridesmaid outfits, and wedding venues.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Phil murmured, surprising Dan.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan asked, turning his head to see Phil looking at his phone.</p><p>\u201cScroll back up,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan complied, and Phil pointed to a set of rings. \u201cWhat about those?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat, for wedding bands?\u201d Dan asked. The set was his and hers style, one being a silver ring with sapphires and a diamond, the other being a silver band with diamonds embedded and wrapping around it.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, maybe engagement ones,\u201d Phil said. \u201cDo you not like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Dan looked down, blushing a little. \u201cI already have one that I, uh, thought would be good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said, feeling warmth grow in his chest at that.</p><p>\u201cNot that I was planning anything special to do with it. We are engaged, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cYeah,\u201d he assured. \u201cWe are. I did propose, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cWe still calling that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it\u2019s a little more romantic than just talking about getting married sometimes,\u201d Phil argued.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s cozier,\u201d Dan admitted. \u201cAnd a bit less stressful.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled. \u201cCan I see the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Tell me if it\u2019s trash, or whatever,\u201d Dan said, opening the safari app on his phone.</p><p>Phil looked at the ring.(<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/rings/cyorings/purchase_review/?did=1153325&amp;ucg=true&amp;sid=1152801\">link</a>)</p><p>It was simple enough, the setting was platinum, in an intertwined pattern, twisting into a design that seemed to be silver plant buds surrounding the gem in the middle. The gem was a sapphire, teal in color and cut round.</p><p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too girly, or whatever?\u201d Dan asked. It was a women\u2019s style ring, but the men\u2019s style engagement bands were so boring in comparison.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like it,\u201d Phil said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Did you pick one for yourself too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dingus, that\u2019s your job,\u201d Dan said. \u201cBut do be aware that if it doesn\u2019t compliment yours, I will be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Phil said softly. \u201cAlright. No pressure.\u201d</p><p>Dan giggled. \u201cPhil, you offered me a glove and I agreed to marry you, I don\u2019t think you should be too concerned.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d He leaned his head on Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat about the wedding bands?\u201d</p><p>Dan set his phone down. \u201cI think we should look at that once we have a plan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all figured out, wow,\u201d Phil said, yawning. \u201cThink I can help when we actually plan the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on if you have good ideas,\u201d Dan teased.</p><p>\u201cExcuse you. I have the most brilliant ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did agree to marry me, so I guess you can have good ideas sometimes,\u201d Dan said, settling down against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cSee, exactly,\u201d Phil agreed, leaning against Dan\u2019s shoulder again.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>October 2018</b></p><p>It had been a long few months, and a lot of hours of driving and flying and time to think. And it had been a lot of shows of meeting with fans, of hearing their thoughts, of having a real interaction with the people who watched their content and making more sense of the boundaries between an audience and the act. At some points in the tour, there were these deafening moments of realization. At some points, everything seemed much simpler.</p><p>Phil was worried that those moments would wash away as they returned back to business as usual. But they returned home, and things didn\u2019t change or revert.</p><p>It was even quieter at home, gave them even more time to just think, especially as they spent most of their first day back in bed. While Dan was asleep at a normal hour, Phil had woken up far too early from the jet-lag. He and Dan had to edit their film, had to try and get any opportunity they could to reach Brazil or Mexico with their tour, had to get back to work for a while, do spooky week, PINOF 10, and eventually something for Christmas, but after they didn\u2019t really have anything major planned yet in their professional lives.</p><p>Phil thought back to the beginning of the tour, to the end of 2017, their \u201clife stuff\u201d year. Thought about how much Dan\u2019s Pinterest board had filled up in the past few years. Thought about when Dan asked him to promise that they would finally do it after interactive introverts ended.</p><p>Phil had never been too invested in the idea of marriage. His brother hadn\u2019t gotten married to his serious, long term, girlfriend. His parents had more recently been quiet about their wants, though Phil knew his mother was probably holding out hope. He had never been desperate to get married, but he couldn\u2019t say he\u2019d never fantasized about it as a romantic and lonely teenager, at the beginning of his and Dan\u2019s relationship, as he and Dan started to relax into their domestic, committed, life. He\u2019d thought it impossible for so long, just a distant dream. He had been able to dull it down in his mind, come up with reasons it was impractical, or silly, or an outdated tradition. But with the option available, with Dan seeming so interested in it, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. He suddenly began wanting to write \u201chusband\u201d on medical paperwork, started to wish they got those silly words, those silly rings. He even started to fantasize about vows, about actually celebrating their love, their romantic love, in front of friends and family. And Phil knew Dan probably started to feel the same around the same time that all these feelings had surfaced for Phil.</p><p>Phil opened his phone\u2019s safari app, clicking on the page that had been favorited for a while. He already had his preferences set in, but he glanced them over again.</p><p>Phil smiled a little. He put it in his credit card information, and clicked checkout, purchasing the two rings.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>December 2018</b></p><p>Finally, the official Interactive Introverts DVD, as well as a Director\u2019s Commentary, was out of their hands, their work done. They continued to film videos between dreamful conversations about the next \u2018phase\u2019 of \u2018Dan and Phil\u2019 as a professional duo.</p><p>The slowing of their lives had left room for the sadness to sneak back into Dan\u2019s head, which made sense, seeing as this was much like a come down off of a high, but he was readjusting well. He got back into the swing of day to day domestic life with Phil and even began trying to pick up the healthy habits he\u2019d managed to beat into himself before the tour began.</p><p>Things were honestly really fucking good aside from the occasional overwhelm that could creep up on Dan when it came to the next move in his career. He had made a bargain with himself to stay off social media (for the most part), which was a bit harder than he had expected it to be, but overall helpful in his quest to rediscover who he was by himself rather than as an entertainer.</p><p>Christmas seemed to happen all at once. One day it was December 1st and the next they were in their rooms packing to visit Phil\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019ll spend Christmas together next year?\u201d Dan asked quietly, folding a t-shirt and setting it in his case. The question came up every year. It always felt odd to spend so much of their time together only to part for the holidays. Dan was spending a few days with Phil\u2019s family up North and returning to his hometown just in time for Christmas Day, but it was still strange to him that the two of them weren\u2019t able to be together on Christmas Day. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Phil said. \u201cIt\u2019s just tough getting our families together, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, as he always did in reply.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan agreed with a soft sigh, knowing there was nothing that could be done about it tonight. \u201cYou know, this won\u2019t fly when we\u2019re married,\u201d he said, lacing his tone with humor that was just a little forced.</p><p>Phil smiled in a sad sort of way. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure it out by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so far away,\u201d Dan said softly. Sometimes this stupid marriage thing felt like a dream where as soon as they got close to it, it moved further away.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan, frowning a little.</p><p>Dan sighed. \u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just the holidays, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always feels weird to not, like\u2026you know, be a family around Christmas.\u201d He didn\u2019t look over at Phil as he shoved pairs of socks into the pocket of his suitcase.</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes were on Dan, however. He thought of the small box containing two rings that were hidden away in the flat, somewhere Dan wouldn\u2019t stumble upon it. Maybe he should have gotten it. Should have given it to Dan right then as a reassurance of his intentions. Maybe he should have gone and grabbed it so they could bring it up North with them and he could give it to Dan there.</p><p>It was Christmas, though. And Dan and Phil were going to Phil\u2019s parents, and then Dan to his. Though Dan and Phil liked to think of themselves as already engaged, the rings would look and feel like a proposal, a more official one than the few they had shared. They deserved to have that moment by itself with nothing else to take from it.</p><p>Dan was folding his clothing a bit faster now, shoving it into his case a bit harder, his jaw tense.</p><p>Phil sat on the bed. \u201cDan,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Dan paused and looked over at Phil.</p><p>\u201cNext year,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better make good on that, Lester,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI always keep my promises,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cDebatable,\u201d Dan answered with a small grin.</p><p>Phil threw a pair of underwear at Dan. \u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>Dan grinned wider. \u201cOh, you do, do you? Hmm, let\u2019s see. \u2018Oh, Dan, I won\u2019t leave the cupboard door opens anymore, promise,\u2019 or\u2014\u201d Phil threw another item of clothing at him and Dan giggled. \u201c\u2014or \u2018oh, Dan, if you get the post today, I\u2019ll do it next time I promi\u2014\u201d Dan was cut off when a pillow hit him in the face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst and I hate you,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan just grinned. \u201cWell you promised to marry me, so sucks to suck,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Phil agreed with a smile. \u201cPick up those clothes,\u201d Phil said, motioning to the clothes on the floor by Dan.</p><p>\u201cOh, the clothes you threw onto the floor, sure yeah,\u201d Dan said, throwing a pair of underwear at Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Dan mentioned, and it sounded a bit more sincere than Phil would have expected.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Phil answered.</p><p>~\u2022~\u2022~</p><p><b>February 2019</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were walking down the same path by the beach again. Phil\u2019s birthday had been lovely, as usual. It was cozy and in the company of family, and all in all a nice time. Dan enjoyed the seclusion of the Lesters\u2019 home even more than the times before today. They were enjoying being just them.</p><p>The last few years had been spent learning how to comfortably open themselves up. Now, they had an idea of where they were going career-wise and in the eyes of the public. The fear was gone. Or at least dulled a bit. And with no fear creating a wall between Dan and Phil and the eyes that watched them, it was time to relearn which moments not to share, which moments would just be theirs. Dan himself had decided to just be his for a while. So, it went without saying that this trip was theirs.</p><p>Last year, walking down this path, they thought about how they were basically a year into being engaged. They\u2019d talked about the year they were embarking on. A World Tour. There was no time for life plans, and they didn\u2019t mind it as much as they had expected. For a year, the Dan and Phil of everyday life were the same as Entertainer Dan and Phil. Most of the time, Entertainer Dan and Phil is what Dan and Phil wanted to be. And so, they loved it. They loved standing in front of people who adored them for reasons Dan and Phil didn\u2019t always understand, hearing rooms of people laugh because of something they said, meeting people who said that Dan and Phil made them happy, made them feel safe, gave them a community. They loved this family. Their family was this huge, messy, family of people who watched their content to be entertained and the two weirdos who created said content.</p><p>This year, they walked down the path, they thought about how they were basically two years engaged. They realized that they were back to a family of two again. Entertainer and everyday life had to find a balance again. They were home. They had time for life stuff. Dan wanted that life stuff more than he ever had before, and he knew Phil wanted it to.</p><p>Phil turned to the right and Dan followed as he walked down onto the beach, sitting on the sand. Dan didn\u2019t say anything, sitting beside him. The silence laid over them like a blanket, and Dan wasn\u2019t ready to peak his head out yet. It was comforting to be with someone without feeling the need to perform, to talk, to be interesting. Dan supposed that was one of the reasons he and Phil worked so well. Neither of them ever had to be interesting around each other. They could go for hours just listening to one and other breathe, or, as Phil was doing, taking in the way the other looked.</p><p>Dan looked out to the ocean, but Phil knew he could tell Phil was looking at him. Their eyes on one and other felt normal, comforting. They quite liked to look at each other. And Phil was quite liking looking at Dan as it was. Dan\u2019s hood was down, and his hair was a mess of curls, the wind playing with it, tangling it. When they returned to the house, Phil would run his fingers through it and untangle it. His cheeks were flushed pink from the cold, the one spot on his cheek almost red.</p><p>Phil gripped the box in his coat pocket with his left hand and took in a breath.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Dan looked over. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s for me too,\u201d he said. He pulled the box out of his pocket and set it on the beach between them. Phil could tell the second Dan realized. He flicked his eyes up to meet Phil\u2019s, almost hesitant.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Phil murmured.</p><p>Dan bit his lip, reaching out his left hand to take the lid off the box. He held his breath, letting it out all at once when he saw the two rings. He\u2019d seen one before, on a LED screen, after spending hours picking it out for Phil. The other was new. It was gorgeous. It complimented the one Dan had picked out for Phil. The intertwining ring setting ended in leaves which surrounded a dark jewel. (<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/custom-rings/Solitaire-Leaf-Ring-1154259/\">link</a>)</p><p>Dan felt tears well in his eyes. It was strange how two shiny pieces of jewelry could make so much emotion well in Dan\u2019s chest.</p><p>Phil watched Dan\u2019s reaction, smiling a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014uh,\u201d Dan started, going to touch one of the rings. \u201cThat one\u2019s mine?\u201d</p><p>Phil reached to grab the ring from the box. He held it between his fingers and offered it out. \u201cCan I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Dan replied, voice barely a breath. He held out his left hand for Phil. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was shaking due to the emotion, the cold air, or a combination of both. Phil slid the engagement ring onto Dan\u2019s ring finger and Dan felt tears leak from the sides of his eyes as he watched it take its place resting snugly at the base of Dan\u2019s previously naked ring finger. Dan held his hand out, looking at it. He choked on a sob, laughing a little at the silliness of the overwhelming emotion. \u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI want to start planning our wedding,\u201d Phil said, and Dan had been aching to ask the same of Phil. Christmas and Phil\u2019s birthday and work had stopped him, but he was so glad Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Dan said, voice broken with the emotion. He moved the box aside and moved closer, leaning in to hug Phil tightly, burying his face in Phil\u2019s neck, shoving off the hood he wore. \u00a0</p><p>Phil held Dan back just as tightly, and they breathed each other in, held each other close, let the reality of the words Phil had just spoken sink in. Phil breathed out shakily, holding Dan a bit tighter, feeling tears well in his own eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan answered, laughing through his tears. \u201cFor real this time.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed a little too. \u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. He pulled back to look him in the eyes. \u201cFor real. As soon as we get home, I want to find a venue. We\u2019re going to book a date.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled, a few tears slipping down his cheeks. \u201cWait,\u201d he realized, sniffling a little. \u201cLet me\u2013\u201d He reached to grab the box, taking out the ring he had picked out for Phil months and months ago. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled, himself sniffling a bit as he offered his left hand to Dan. Dan slid the ring onto Phil\u2019s ring finger. He compared their two left hands. \u201cThere. We match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled, looking down at his engagement ring. \u201cI never want to take this off,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have everything worked out. In fact, they didn\u2019t have much of anything worked out. They didn\u2019t know how they were going to manage their marriage and engagement publicly. They didn\u2019t know if they would announce it or lead up to it or quietly allow it to happen without much conversation by them. They didn\u2019t know if they would have to take the ring off when they sat in front of cameras and for how long. No doubt they would spend hours and hours talking it through and asking advice and getting unsure and frustrated.</p><p>But none of that mattered because this was the first step. And Dan and Phil were definitely going to book that venue. Dan was thinking of April next year. Phil was picturing Dan in an over-the-top white suit. Dan was thinking about writing vows. Phil was wondering about wedding bands. The two of them were getting married.</p><p>So, for now, Phil said, \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p>",

He had videos to film. He had growing up to do, things to learn, a plan to figure out, YouTube projects to begin. He had a family to disappoint, and fans to entertain, and a boyfriend to try to be the best version of himself for.</p><p>But in the soft, drunken, afterglow, everything seemed easy. They weren&rsquo;t asleep, for some reason, just laying, naked limbs tangled together despite the sweat. Phil&rsquo;s hair tickled Dan&rsquo;s neck, and it&rsquo;d been nearly two years, and Dan sort of thought this was the end game. Though, he&rsquo;d sort of thought that since the day he saw Phil&rsquo;s blue eyes in person rather than through a fuzzy webcam.</p><p>But at first it was fiery and intense and new, and Dan was afraid it might burn out too quickly for his liking. But then the fiery newness started to go away, and nothing felt empty. That was probably when Dan knew.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>It was a scarily naive thought. The decisive thought Dan and Phil would work. Professionally. Publicly. Romantically. Quietly. Indefinitely. But he believed it.</p><p>Youtube could lose relevance tomorrow. The worst of Dan could get the better of him. Dan and Phil could grow and change in ways that weren&rsquo;t so compatible. Phil could tell Dan he wanted to take time apart to grow and develop as people. All these things were perfectly able to happen. In fact, it was&nbsp;almost likely. But, as Dan laid in the presence of the first and only man he&rsquo;d ever loved, and the only man he could ever see himself loving, he knew none of those things would happen. It was a very rare moment for Dan to feel entirely confident and certain in himself, his career, his relationship. But then and there he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Marry me,&rdquo; Dan breathed.</p><p>The words didn&rsquo;t hold any weight. They both knew it. The sad truth was that at the moment they couldn&rsquo;t, even if they were ready for such a commitment. Still, he said them. Because if they were a girl and a guy and this was a romantic comedy, instead of being two irrelevant young men enjoying a single moment of peace in an insane world, the words would mean something. And, before tonight, saying anything like them would have felt far scarier. The thoughts behind them were there. The &ldquo;if we could, I would.&rdquo; So, Dan would pretend for tonight that these words did mean something.</p><p>Dan felt the rumble of Phil&rsquo;s chest, their skin pressed together, before he heard the chuckle. &ldquo;M'kay,&rdquo; he said easily.</p><p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; Dan replied with a soft giggle.</p><p>&ldquo;Gay marriage isn&rsquo;t legal,&rdquo; Phil mentioned, voice quiet and deeper than it would be if they were fully awake, fully sober, and not in private.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck it,&rdquo; Dan replied, his own words a bit slurred with sleepiness. &ldquo;We can go to, like, California and find a liberal courthouse and a socialist priest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good plan,&rdquo; Phil mentioned. &ldquo;We could do one of those, like, civil partnership things,&rdquo; Phil said, as though he&rsquo;d looked into it. &ldquo;Gives us the benefits and&mdash;&rdquo; He yawned. &ldquo;We could even have a party for it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan grinned a little at that, at the idea that Phil seemed to have looked into how they could stay together in the future. &ldquo;Fuck that,&rdquo; he replied anyway. &ldquo;I want a husband.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil grinned back. &ldquo;People&rsquo;ll come to their senses eventually,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll still be around when they do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; Dan asked, moving further into him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replied, yawning again. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll marry you, Howell,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;M'kay,&rdquo; Dan replied softly, yawning as well.</p><p>The morning brought no further comment on it, though it definitely wasn&rsquo;t forgotten. They kept tentative eyes on the news when the gay marriage &ldquo;debate&rdquo; was brought up. How couldn&rsquo;t they? &nbsp;</p><p>And Dan moved in with Phil. And their popularity grew. And Dan began thinking that the naive thoughts he had about the future might actually come to pass.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>June 2012</b></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey,&rdquo; Phil said, alcohol on his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, yes?&rdquo; Dan asked, trying his hardest to focus on looking Phil in the eyes. They&rsquo;d had way too much to drink tonight and there wasn&rsquo;t a single part of him that could see himself regretting it, except that he might&rsquo;ve ruined the conclusion to today&rsquo;s vlog. Fuck it. They were in Vegas. It was Dan&rsquo;s birthday. Sue him.</p><p>Well, it was his late birthday celebration, but he was away with his boyfriend, legally allowed to drink in the states, and giddy on being in love and having an expensive hotel room. It was like back when they were in Jamaica. But with more alcohol and less scenery. So, he was going to enjoy himself a little too much. They both were.</p><p>&ldquo;You know how in Friends&mdash;&rdquo; Phil started.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan asked, lost.</p><p>&ldquo;Friends! The TV show,&rdquo; Phil replied, &ldquo;You know with the: <i>so, no one told you life was gonna be this way,</i>&rdquo; he sang to the tune of the opening theme for friends, a slur in his voice. He proceeded to clap five times in quick succession.</p><p>Dan blinked, remembering the show. &ldquo;Oh yeah! We should watch that,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Shut up. But you know how in Friends they go to Vegas?&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan replied, not sure he did actually remember. He leaned into Phil, who was somehow not so drunk they both fell over. He just wrapped an arm around Dan and looked him in the eyes, grinning.</p><p>&ldquo;And then Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel all decided to get married?&rdquo; he continued.</p><p>Dan frowned, trying to make his brain think of more things than just &lsquo;<i>Phil</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>lean in and kiss</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>smells like rum and coke and those stupid fruity drinks that are for probably meant for girls but fuck it</i>.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, they all got married?&rdquo; Dan asked, frowning as he thought (or attempted to).</p><p>&ldquo;No, Ross and Rachel got married. And Monica and Chandler were gonna get married,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>Dan frowned. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Monica again?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil gently pushed him away, and Dan still stumbled, reaching to grip Phil&rsquo;s arm and steady himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making you watch these with me when we get home,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, okay, so they got married,&rdquo; Dan said, straightening up a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replied, reaching for Dan&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause you can just elope in Vegas.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan took his hand, leaning in and pecking him on the lips. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re saying we should elope,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replied, kissing him again. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get married.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan giggled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunnnk,&rdquo; he slurred.</p><p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;re you, fuck&rsquo;off,&rdquo; Phil whined in reply. &ldquo;What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>Dan laughed loudly. &ldquo;I think marriage licenses work differently than that,&rdquo; he theorized.</p><p>Phil shrugged, pulling Dan closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Well. We could get married,&rdquo; Dan said, pecking Phil on the lips. &ldquo;But then we&rsquo;d have to leave this perfectly good hotel room and the perfectly good hotel bed,&rdquo; Dan said.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d rather fuck me than marry me, I see how it is,&rdquo; Phil said frowning.</p><p>Dan giggled, kissing Phil on the lips again. &ldquo;S&rsquo;my birthday so you have to do what I say,&rdquo; Dan said decisively.</p><p>&ldquo;Your birthday was like two weeks ago,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay compromise,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;We fuck tonight, and get married tomorrow,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Phil thought on this for a moment. &ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; he said, grinning.</p><p>Dan kissed him again, this time longer and messier. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he breathed, pulling back. &ldquo;Before we do the sex thing, I have to go be sick,&rdquo; he said, tapping Phil on the nose and giving a wink before walking into the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Hot,&rdquo; Phil called after him sarcastically.</p><p>Morning would bring hangovers and chuckles and jokes about eloping. It would bring too real thoughts about spending forever together. It would bring too real hopes that they would be able to get married one day, with a proper ceremony and reception, back in the country they grew up in, the country they met in. &nbsp;</p><p>Then they would force themselves out of bed, film the rest of their vlog, and enjoy their final day of vacation in Vegas before they had to return home to real life.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>July 2013</b></p><p>Dan and Phil both watched the rainbow flags waving on the television, soft smiles on their faces. The headline read that the queen had voted queer. She had given her royal assent and the bill finally been passed to begin allowing same-sex marriage. The news reporters spoke about the first marriages probably taking place next summer. Dan felt that this had been a long time coming.</p><p>Dan had sort of imagined he&rsquo;d lost the privilege of marriage when he fell in love with a man. Part of him knew that one day he&rsquo;d be allowed to marry, though, and that day would come sooner now.</p><p>Right now, he didn&rsquo;t need marriage to be happy. He knew Phil felt the same way. They were in love, committed, recovering from a rough patch in their relationship, and focused heavily on their careers.</p><p>Still, they each knew as they moved closer to one and other, soft smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes as they watched the rainbow flags and the happy couples on the screen, that they wanted this one day. That the cheesy normal romance wasn&rsquo;t out of the picture. Dan held Phil&rsquo;s hand and they didn&rsquo;t speak, but they still heard one and other.</p><p>For a moment they allowed themselves to feel pride for who they were and how they loved one and other, and they allowed themselves to imagine a day in the distant future where they maybe no longer felt the need to hide. Where they maybe wore rings on their fingers. Maybe even shared a last name.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>March 2014</b></p><p>The next year and Dan had his laptop on his lap, open to a word document with messily organized ideas, a million tabs open on google about book publishing. They hadn&rsquo;t even decided if they were going to do this yet, but Dan was taken with the idea already. Phil could probably tell by his research.</p><p>There was a bit of wine in their systems and the ambiance of a simple afternoon in. Starting with a silly idea and some giggling, they had now filled two pages with ideas. Dan had never been more ready for anything. He hoped the motivation didn&rsquo;t slip away before they could actually do this.</p><p>Phil read a headline on his phone and smiled softly before flipping on the news. He sat beside Dan as the screen lit up with the happy faces of gay couples piling into courthouses to sign wedding licenses.</p><p>Phil sat beside Dan and leaned against him. Dan looked up and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Think we should head over?&rdquo; he teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan and Phil spotted eloping in a London courthouse,&rdquo; Phil replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be on trending for sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan chuckled. &ldquo;Well, we missed the chance to be the first so, might as well wait I guess,&rdquo; Dan said with a sigh. &ldquo;If the gaming channel fails, we&rsquo;ll call that plan B,&rdquo; Dan joked.</p><p>Phil chuckled. &ldquo;Maybe next year,&rdquo; he murmured, nuzzling into Dan&rsquo;s embrace.</p><p>Things were almost only looking up for the two of them. Popularity, working for BBC, working with charity, Dan&rsquo;s recovery plan when it came to his mental health, Dan and Phil&rsquo;s relaxation of their boundaries around their relationship when it came to viewers. Every day was spent together, they were discussing huge projects and undertakings, they were making videos, they were generally just working on being so happy, and they were both pretty sure the general level of happiness in their life as partners (in business, in love, in life) would only rise as the years went on.</p><p>So maybe next year, if they could find the time.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>April 2015</b></p><p>They were in Japan. They&rsquo;d been in Japan for a few days, and they were standing on the balcony of their hotel room, looking out at the lights of the city. Something about being in exotic places was insanely romantic. Dan and Phil had been wanting to come here for ages.</p><p>This had been sort of crazy for them. They hadn&rsquo;t really done something so spontaneous since they had first met, but they&rsquo;d realized that they could do it. Money wasn&rsquo;t an issue, they had the time, and they could say they were doing it for their book. Still, when the cameras were off, Dan described it as their romantic getaway and Phil just giggled and went along.</p><p>It was hilarious to Dan that it sort of felt like a honeymoon. They&rsquo;d taken vacations together before, Jamaica came to mind, but it was never just them. Never just a romantic getaway. There was always something else to do.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s arms were around Phil as they stood, looking out at the cityscape. They&rsquo;d gotten back to the hotel rather late and both of them were exhausted, but there was still a residual giddiness from the loveliness of the day keeping them awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get married,&rdquo; Phil said with a hum. &ldquo;Right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan smiled. &ldquo;In Japan?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Phil shrugged. &ldquo;Yeah. Just like elope. We don&rsquo;t have to tell anyone,&rdquo; he murmured, turning his head to look at Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Gay marriage isn&rsquo;t legal here,&rdquo; Dan mentioned, leaving out the fact that they were foreigners and therefore probably couldn&rsquo;t actually get married in a different country.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I always forget we&rsquo;re a gay couple.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so fucking weird,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I love being here, though,&rdquo; Dan dropped a kiss to Phil&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;With you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It just, feels so freeing, to be somewhere they don&rsquo;t really know &lsquo;Dan and Phil,&rsquo; so we can just, like, be Dan and Phil,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil breathed, leaning back into Dan. &ldquo;I wish we could stay forever.&rdquo;</p><p>They looked out at the lights. God, it was romantic. They were far from London and their beds and the sofa, but Dan felt right at home there, resting his chin on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder and taking in the easy intimacy.</p><p>&ldquo;We&#8239;should&#8239;get married,&rdquo; Dan said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing the tour, the book, we&rsquo;ll be set after this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We could even throw a fancy expensive wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckled and hummed thoughtfully. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After the tour,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find a place to live, though. A long-term place,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that after the tour too then. 2015 is planning. 2016 is tour. 2017 will just be us,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Life stuff. You and me stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiled. &ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;2017&rsquo;s so far, though,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Dan looked over at Phil, his eyes reflecting the light of the moon and the city. &ldquo;It just gives us time to get there,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;These are going to be the best years of our lives,&rdquo; Dan decided.</p><p>Phil smiled because he knew it was true. They were doing everything they never dreamed they would be able to do. Big creative projects, performances, presenting truer and more real versions of themselves to the world, growing into the people they were always meant to be, watching their relationship mature into the beautiful, committed, healthy relationship that it was always getting better at being.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew when I met you these would be the best years of my life,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off,&rdquo; Dan replied, chuckling. &ldquo;You probably thought we&rsquo;d forget about each other after a few months.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil giggled. &ldquo;Maybe at first, but when we were in my bedroom&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You fucked me and then knew it was true love?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p><p>Phil elbowed him in the stomach. &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I actually hate you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan grinned, holding Phil tighter against him.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what I meant. When you were actually there in person, and we just&#8239;worked&#8239;and I never wanted you to leave, you know? I wasn&rsquo;t like, &lsquo;yeah this is who I&rsquo;m gonna marry,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;But I was like, &lsquo;yeah this guy&rsquo;s gonna give me some of the best times of my life.&rsquo; I definitely wasn&rsquo;t wrong,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>Dan grinned, squeezing his arms around Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, like, extremely, madly, in love with you, you know,&rdquo; he mentioned.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I know,&rdquo; Phil replied. He finally turned around in Dan&rsquo;s arms to look Dan in the eyes. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the guy I&rsquo;m gonna marry,&rdquo; he decided.</p><p>Dan nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;Yeah. That might be cool,&rdquo; he agreed.</p><p>Phil grinned and leaned in to kiss Dan on the lips. One of those smiling kisses where it wasn&rsquo;t quite effective because they were smiling too much, but the thought was there.</p><p>Dan wrapped his arms around Phil, kissing him properly. They had two days left in the beautiful, exotic, vacation, and they were sure as hell going to make the most of them.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>February 2017</b></p><p>Some days, the prospect of marriage didn&rsquo;t feel so close or so comfy. Some days it was the furthest thing from their minds. Some days, it was a scary sort of change that they didn&rsquo;t want to confront. Some days it was a desire hanging over them, reminding them that they were sort of missing something, but not providing any sort of way to get there.</p><p>Dan and Phil hadn&rsquo;t had two seconds to breathe once the tour started. Between the documentary filming, the performing, trying to continue to post videos, and being tourists, they had been fully drained. They had collapsed beside each other each night, content, fulfilled but exhausted. Eventually, the shows ran out and they returned home. They released their movie, the story of TATINOF, and then all of a sudden everything slowed down. They had done it. Done a Dan and Phil book and tour. Immortalized themselves, in a way.</p><p>And, now, suddenly, they had time. Time to think. Time to feel. Time to talk.</p><p>Dan tagged along to see Phil&rsquo;s family on Phil&rsquo;s birthday. His thirtieth. In some ways it felt like Dan and Phil were both just kids when they met and then almost overnight, they were these actual adults with semi-functioning lives. And now Phil was turning thirty. Thirty years of life. Eight of those years with Dan.</p><p>It felt like it was time for something. Something more. Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t exactly time, but it was getting much closer.</p><p>Phil was pretty sure he knew exactly what that something was when he and Dan were walking over the grassy hills by the beach on the Isle of Man with Martyn and Cornelia and Phil&rsquo;s parents. When Dan slipped down after stepping on an overhang, cursing. When there was a brief moment of concern before Phil started laughing. When he climbed down a bit more carefully and offered Dan a hand.</p><p>And when Phil captured the moment for Dan&rsquo;s Instagram as he deemed the occurrence very on brand.</p><p>They did sort of want everyone to know that they were up here visiting Phil&rsquo;s family together. To stop the questions that would no doubt be running through the fan&rsquo;s&rsquo; minds, maybe. Maybe just to show off a little. Maybe as a step further out of &lsquo;the closet,&rsquo; a term they had both sort-of grown to dislike.</p><p>And Phil knew again when Dan was laughing and making jokes with Phil&rsquo;s family like it was second nature. When Dan volunteered to help Kath in the kitchen and when Dan crawled up to lay his head against Phil&rsquo;s shoulder on the couch when he&rsquo;d finished. When they crawled into bed later that night and Phil thought about how strange it was that they hadn&rsquo;t spent Christmas together.</p><p>The next day, they got up early, beat Phil&rsquo;s mum even, and left a note on the counter saying they had gone off on a walk. Sappy as shit, but Phil knew his mother would smile. Perhaps while rolling her eyes.</p><p>The paths here were lovely to walk down, the area small. It felt a bit like a little corner of the world where no one else could see them. Where they were hidden away, untouchable.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; Phil murmured, his voice quiet as he held his phone camera up. He and Dan had always loved photos. Capturing moments to come back to later.</p><p>Dan smiled looking over at him. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look cute,&rdquo; he said. His voice was soft, coated in fondness. &ldquo;For Instagram. Maybe,&rdquo; Phil replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Dan asked. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just showing off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; Phil said, knowing what Dan meant.</p><p>Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t the right time for this conversation, but Phil was never a patient man.</p><p>&ldquo;I want them to know you&rsquo;re here with me,&rdquo; he said softly. He wanted everyone to know, really.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dan answered. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; Dan shoved his hands back into his pockets, dimple popping even with just the slight smile he wore.</p><p>They continued walking and Phil tried to sort out his thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Marry me,&rdquo; he said before he had the chance.</p><p>Phil supposed that if they were another couple, Dan might&rsquo;ve looked up in surprise. That Dan might have grinned and cried and said &lsquo;yes, yes, yes&rsquo; over and over. As it was, they were Dan and Phil, and this was not the first time the words had slipped past one of their lips.</p><p>So, Dan smiled a bit more, looking over at Phil. He pulled his hand from his pocket, offering it to Phil.</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t do that. Normally. But Phil was starting to think that they were going to begin redefining their normal. So, on the empty stretch of beach, Phil took Dan&rsquo;s hand. No one was around. Dan and Phil were the only two people in the world right now.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to,&rdquo; Dan said.</p><p>Phil realized that if Dan had simply said yes, he would have been happy. He knew that they would have come into roadblocks, though. They would have to postpone.</p><p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked over at him. He smiled again, tugging Phil after him and down one of the grassy hills and toward the water. The ground was wet with the early-morning frost, but Dan sat down on the sand, gesturing for Phil to do the same. The two looked out at the ocean.</p><p>&ldquo;Whenever you want me to,&rdquo; Dan said quietly.</p><p>Phil was surprised by that, looking over at Dan. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d marry you tomorrow if we had a plan ready tonight,&rdquo; Dan said, looking at his left hand. At the finger that sometimes, like now, looked naked.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish it was that easy sometimes,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will get married though, won&rsquo;t we? Soon?&rdquo; Phil asked. &nbsp;</p><p>There was a longing to his voice. A longing for the future that was he had wanted to be here by now. Phil wanted to get married. Wanted to have that silly domestic bliss. Still, he knew that he and Dan weren&rsquo;t entirely ready, despite their ages, their financial comfort, and the family and friends watching them to see when they would. They would know when they were truly ready. They would build up to it. That was what they did. Sink into it, adjust to it. Maybe it was caution. Maybe they just wanted to savor the journey.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dan answered. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s time, we&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; he said. Dan had the habit of knowing just what Phil was thinking. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the spontaneity type, anyways, are we?&rdquo; He looked out at the ocean. The serenity of waves lapping up against the sand. The cool wind stung his cheeks and he&rsquo;d pulled away his hand to bury it in his pocket where it was warmer.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looked over at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we be engaged?&rdquo; Phil asked, squeezing Dan&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Dan sort of felt like they already were, but a little clarification never hurt. This felt like Phil saying that he wanted to speed things up, just a little. Wanted to bring this dream a little closer to them. Dan and Phil never really got a proposal, at least not a dramatic and life-changing one, so Dan grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you proposing to me, Phil Lester?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Should I get on one knee?&rdquo; Phil asked, also grinning.</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t even got a ring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle. &ldquo;Some people get extravagant romantic date proposals with rose petals and&mdash;&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Phil shoved Dan, pouting and Dan giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;champagne, and diamond rings, and long emotional speeches, and&mdash;&rdquo; He was laughing too hard now as Phil punched him in the arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, Dan, fine, hold on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, what are you gonna do?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p><p>Phil just grinned, looking around and patting his pockets. He reached into his coat pocket. Pulling out a glove, he seemed to make a decision. He looked at Dan and grinned, getting on one knee, offering up the glove.</p><p>&ldquo;Daniel Howell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not have a ring, but that&rsquo;s just another decision that you and me can make together. So please accept this glove as&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where did you even get that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mum sent me out with them yesterday, now shush.&rdquo; He cleared his throat again. &ldquo;Daniel James Howell. We&rsquo;re up here visiting my family, and it always feels so right to have you here as well. I think I&rsquo;m lucky enough that I get to have my family wherever I am because you are my family. You&rsquo;re my home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Phil&hellip;&rdquo; Dan said, smiling at the silliness of it, but also feeling tears gather. He hadn&rsquo;t been expecting to actually get emotional.</p><p>&ldquo;You are. You&rsquo;re my best friend and my family and my partner in, like, everything that I do. I love that. I want to celebrate that in every way in the world. I want you to be right here with me forever. I want to make endless memories with you. I wanna promise you that I love you forever and ever and ever. So, if you will please accept this glove, which I spent my whole life savings on, and let me know. Will you marry me? Be my fianc&eacute;, then, when we figure it out, my husband?&rdquo; Phil was beaming at Dan, his eyes sparkling, holding out a goddamn glove, and they were so stupid, but Dan loved it so much.</p><p>Dan knew they were going to get married. He had always known, but somehow hearing it like this felt different. It felt real. It felt tangible. He couldn&rsquo;t help that tears were starting to slip down his cheeks. He giggled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said through his giggles and sniffles. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He offered his left hand.</p><p>Phil grinned, sliding the winter mitten, with some difficulty, onto Dan&rsquo;s hand. Dan held his hand up and looked at it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; Phil retorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here, you fucking nerd,&rdquo; Dan said, still cry-laughing a little.</p><p>Phil stood and offered a hand to Dan. He pulled Dan up and smiled at him, bringing a hand to his cheek to wipe away tears with his thumb. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Dan&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Dan said.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell your mum we&rsquo;ve gotten officially engaged, though,&rdquo; Dan mentioned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll ruin your whole birthday month.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil just grinned and kissed Dan again. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he murmured, handing Dan the other glove. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matching set.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You spent two of your whole life savings?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I used yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo; Dan giggled. &ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re such a fucking twat. Fucking engagement glove.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil grinned, absolutely pleased with himself. &ldquo;I was actually going to grab the first rock I saw, but I thought I&rsquo;d use something you could actually wear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pfffft,&rdquo; Dan breathed. &ldquo;Gee, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the thing though,&rdquo; Phil said, grinning. &ldquo;Why should love and commitment need to be represented by material items? I mean, who even&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan cut Phil off by pressing his lips to Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Shut the fuck up,&rdquo; he breathed, pulling back. &ldquo;I want a ring.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil just grinned some more. &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he murmured, looking over Dan. &ldquo;Let me take a picture of you.&rdquo; He looked stupidly adorable in his hat, cheeks flushed from the cold, eyes just a little watery from the emotion. He looked so happy.</p><p>Dan chuckled but complied. (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQBNr4Ujx_3/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\">link</a>)</p><p>And when they returned to the house, and Kath asked how their walk was, they shared a glance and a smile between themselves and simply said it was lovely.&nbsp;</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>May 2017</b></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God, no,&rdquo; Phil said between giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Dan asked, giggling himself.</p><p>Phil shoved Dan. &ldquo;Wedding rings are supposed to represent eternal love, not be a goth fashion statement,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Dan pouted, moving back to sit against the headboard. Phil leaned his head against his shoulder again, and Dan smiled a little. Phil looked back down at Dan&rsquo;s phone.</p><p>The two of them were sat in bed having a lazy day. Things in the new flat still needed unpacking and neither of them had eaten anything but takeaway in about a week, but they were exhausted, so they were in bed. &nbsp;</p><p>Dan was scrolling through Pinterest wedding bands that cost way too much because the tour was over, they&rsquo;d become engaged, they were moving, Dan was planning a lot of change with his YouTube, and even though he&rsquo;d now realized 2017 was far too busy without any plan of marriage, he knew it would be coming up in the next few years. He hoped it would. And he was impatient, and he liked to fantasize.</p><p>Dan clicked on a suggested image of the ring beside another similar ring. &ldquo;But, look, they have matching ones, we could be aesthetic husbands,&rdquo; Dan said, grinning as he looked over to see Phil&rsquo;s expression.</p><p>Phil was unimpressed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying, is black the most romantic of colors?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Black is the only acceptable color,&rdquo; Dan replied.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see a black ring on someone&rsquo;s finger and think they&rsquo;re married, you just think they&rsquo;re some sad edgy person,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;But I am some sad edgy person,&rdquo; Dan argued.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but&hellip;I&hellip;Well, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying my wedding ring shouldn&rsquo;t be true to myself?&rdquo; Dan teased, climbing over Phil in a way that had become a little smoother over the years, and sitting atop his thighs.</p><p>Phil grinned, looking up at Dan. &ldquo;I definitely think it should,&rdquo; he said. He took Dan&rsquo;s left hand, looking at it. &ldquo;So maybe something gold, hm? Maybe with some diamonds, I dunno. That&rsquo;s more you, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; He looked back up at Dan. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Dan looked affronted, &ldquo;Do you know me at all?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil grinned. &ldquo;Better than you know yourself, Danny boy,&rdquo; he replied, leaning forward and kissing Dan on the lips.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s lips twitched up, face remaining close to Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Maybe silver.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil kissed him again. &ldquo;Maybe the engagement ring can be black, or grey. With diamonds and sapphire.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan grinned. &ldquo;Oh, so you actually are getting me an engagement ring, are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shrugged. &ldquo;Yeah. Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m getting you one too then,&rdquo; Dan decided. &ldquo;But we probably shouldn&rsquo;t make it a surprise, because we have to coordinate.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to need to go on another tour with all this talk, Daniel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Told you we should&rsquo;ve eloped in Vegas during tatinof,&rdquo; Dan said with a sigh.</p><p>Phil kissed Dan again, rolling him over to kiss him properly, the two of them giggling.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>March 2018</b></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going on tour again,&rdquo; Dan said with a pout, head leaning against Phil&rsquo;s shoulder as he looked through wedding Pinterest boards, an activity that had started as a distant, somewhat joke of a dream in 2015 upon seeing a suit that Dan could just perfectly imagine walking down an aisle wearing and needing to save it. It had evolved into a more frequent activity and saving posts to his board called &ldquo;soon &#128141;.&rdquo;</p><p>They&rsquo;d returned from today&rsquo;s rehearsals and promptly collapsed on the couch together, Dan absently opening Pinterest and being bombarded by posts for wedding planning, seeing as he&rsquo;d only really gotten the Pinterest to save the stuff he wanted to remember for when they finally did do what they&rsquo;d been quietly planning with each other.</p><p>&ldquo;It was your idea,&rdquo; Phil replied, fingers absently stroking Dan&rsquo;s arm as he looked at his own phone.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dan said, still pouting. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be amazing,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Phil smiled, looking over at Dan, noticing what he was doing on his phone. Phil&rsquo;s smile fell a little.</p><p>&ldquo;One more hurrah, right?&rdquo; Phil murmured. &ldquo;Go out, see the world, meet all the people who support us, give a real show, a more &lsquo;us&rsquo; show. Like you said. Then,&rdquo; Phil kissed the top of Dan&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Then, we&rsquo;ll do some more &lsquo;us&rsquo; things, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Us?&rdquo; Everything the two of them did was an &lsquo;us&rsquo; thing.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; Phil murmured, and Dan did. He didn&rsquo;t just mean them. He meant them in the romantic sense and in the life sense.</p><p>Dan sat up, shifting to look at Phil. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s next for &lsquo;us,&rsquo; Phil Lester? What&rsquo;s the official list?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiled. &ldquo;So, the official list that we&rsquo;ve both been unofficially making together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil suppressed his grin as he replied. &ldquo;Alright. Well, of course, a forever home, right? Buy our own place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;Obviously. Get that one in the works. What else?&rdquo; he asked, looking Phil in the eyes, grinning himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Phil replied, plucking Dan&rsquo;s phone up off the couch, still open to a picture of a wedding cake. &ldquo;Marry me,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Dan smiled at the words. <i>Marry me</i>.</p><p>Perhaps it had lost its intense, romantic, sound. Perhaps that was okay. It didn&rsquo;t sound like a proposal. Now, it sounded like a promise. It sounded like home. Like the next item on their list. It wasn&rsquo;t a crazy, romantic, spontaneous, idea. It was the thing they&rsquo;d been dying to relax into for so long.</p><p>Dan grinned. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he agreed, leaning to kiss Phil softly on the lips. &ldquo;No more putting it off? I&rsquo;m tired of being a fianc&eacute;,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;A guy needs to level up. When we get home again, after the tour, are we gonna figure things out? Actually, do it?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil reached to push his curls from his forehead. &ldquo;Yes. I honestly don&rsquo;t think I can wait too much longer,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; Dan replied moving into Phil&rsquo;s side and wrapping his arms around his waist, leaning against him. &ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p><p>Phil smiled. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hummed. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, pulling back to look Phil in the eyes. &ldquo;I wanna be your husband.&rdquo;</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>July 2018</b></p><p>It was a late night in a hotel room in the states. Dan was sat against the headboard, occasionally grabbing a chip from their mostly-eaten room service dinner. Phil had crawled up next to him and sat beside him, shoulders and legs pressed together. Nothing had really brought upon the subject. Phil had glanced over at Dan&rsquo;s phone to find Pinterest wedding boards again. Phil was never sure if he was dreaming wistfully about the future or if he just opened Pinterest when he was bored and thought &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a cool wedding cake idea, save that for the future&rsquo; and then got pulled into a vortex of aesthetically pleasing table-settings, bridesmaid outfits, and wedding venues.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Phil murmured, surprising Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan asked, turning his head to see Phil looking at his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Scroll back up,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>Dan complied, and Phil pointed to a set of rings. &ldquo;What about those?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;What, for wedding bands?&rdquo; Dan asked. The set was his and hers style, one being a silver ring with sapphires and a diamond, the other being a silver band with diamonds embedded and wrapping around it.</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, maybe engagement ones,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;Do you not like them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just&mdash;&rdquo; Dan looked down, blushing a little. &ldquo;I already have one that I, uh, thought would be good for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Phil said, feeling warmth grow in his chest at that.</p><p>&ldquo;Not that I was planning anything special to do with it. We are engaged, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p><p>Phil smiled. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he assured. &ldquo;We are. I did propose, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan giggled. &ldquo;We still calling that a proposal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s a little more romantic than just talking about getting married sometimes,&rdquo; Phil argued.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s cozier,&rdquo; Dan admitted. &ldquo;And a bit less stressful.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiled. &ldquo;Can I see the ring?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Tell me if it&rsquo;s trash, or whatever,&rdquo; Dan said, opening the safari app on his phone.</p><p>Phil looked at the ring.(<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/rings/cyorings/purchase_review/?did=1153325&amp;ucg=true&amp;sid=1152801\">link</a>)</p><p>It was simple enough, the setting was platinum, in an intertwined pattern, twisting into a design that seemed to be silver plant buds surrounding the gem in the middle. The gem was a sapphire, teal in color and cut round.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh wow,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too girly, or whatever?&rdquo; Dan asked. It was a women&rsquo;s style ring, but the men&rsquo;s style engagement bands were so boring in comparison.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I like it,&rdquo; Phil said with a grin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect. Did you pick one for yourself too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, dingus, that&rsquo;s your job,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;But do be aware that if it doesn&rsquo;t compliment yours, I will be upset.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Phil said softly. &ldquo;Alright. No pressure.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan giggled. &ldquo;Phil, you offered me a glove and I agreed to marry you, I don&rsquo;t think you should be too concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo; He leaned his head on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What about the wedding bands?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan set his phone down. &ldquo;I think we should look at that once we have a plan,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it all figured out, wow,&rdquo; Phil said, yawning. &ldquo;Think I can help when we actually plan the wedding?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Depends on if you have good ideas,&rdquo; Dan teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse you. I have the most brilliant ideas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you did agree to marry me, so I guess you can have good ideas sometimes,&rdquo; Dan said, settling down against the pillows.</p><p>&ldquo;See, exactly,&rdquo; Phil agreed, leaning against Dan&rsquo;s shoulder again.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>October 2018</b></p><p>It had been a long few months, and a lot of hours of driving and flying and time to think. And it had been a lot of shows of meeting with fans, of hearing their thoughts, of having a real interaction with the people who watched their content and making more sense of the boundaries between an audience and the act. At some points in the tour, there were these deafening moments of realization. At some points, everything seemed much simpler.</p><p>Phil was worried that those moments would wash away as they returned back to business as usual. But they returned home, and things didn&rsquo;t change or revert.</p><p>It was even quieter at home, gave them even more time to just think, especially as they spent most of their first day back in bed. While Dan was asleep at a normal hour, Phil had woken up far too early from the jet-lag. He and Dan had to edit their film, had to try and get any opportunity they could to reach Brazil or Mexico with their tour, had to get back to work for a while, do spooky week, PINOF 10, and eventually something for Christmas, but after they didn&rsquo;t really have anything major planned yet in their professional lives.</p><p>Phil thought back to the beginning of the tour, to the end of 2017, their &ldquo;life stuff&rdquo; year. Thought about how much Dan&rsquo;s Pinterest board had filled up in the past few years. Thought about when Dan asked him to promise that they would finally do it after interactive introverts ended.</p><p>Phil had never been too invested in the idea of marriage. His brother hadn&rsquo;t gotten married to his serious, long term, girlfriend. His parents had more recently been quiet about their wants, though Phil knew his mother was probably holding out hope. He had never been desperate to get married, but he couldn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;d never fantasized about it as a romantic and lonely teenager, at the beginning of his and Dan&rsquo;s relationship, as he and Dan started to relax into their domestic, committed, life. He&rsquo;d thought it impossible for so long, just a distant dream. He had been able to dull it down in his mind, come up with reasons it was impractical, or silly, or an outdated tradition. But with the option available, with Dan seeming so interested in it, he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. He suddenly began wanting to write &ldquo;husband&rdquo; on medical paperwork, started to wish they got those silly words, those silly rings. He even started to fantasize about vows, about actually celebrating their love, their romantic love, in front of friends and family. And Phil knew Dan probably started to feel the same around the same time that all these feelings had surfaced for Phil.</p><p>Phil opened his phone&rsquo;s safari app, clicking on the page that had been favorited for a while. He already had his preferences set in, but he glanced them over again.</p><p>Phil smiled a little. He put it in his credit card information, and clicked checkout, purchasing the two rings.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>December 2018</b></p><p>Finally, the official Interactive Introverts DVD, as well as a Director&rsquo;s Commentary, was out of their hands, their work done. They continued to film videos between dreamful conversations about the next &lsquo;phase&rsquo; of &lsquo;Dan and Phil&rsquo; as a professional duo.</p><p>The slowing of their lives had left room for the sadness to sneak back into Dan&rsquo;s head, which made sense, seeing as this was much like a come down off of a high, but he was readjusting well. He got back into the swing of day to day domestic life with Phil and even began trying to pick up the healthy habits he&rsquo;d managed to beat into himself before the tour began.</p><p>Things were honestly really fucking good aside from the occasional overwhelm that could creep up on Dan when it came to the next move in his career. He had made a bargain with himself to stay off social media (for the most part), which was a bit harder than he had expected it to be, but overall helpful in his quest to rediscover who he was by himself rather than as an entertainer.</p><p>Christmas seemed to happen all at once. One day it was December 1st and the next they were in their rooms packing to visit Phil&rsquo;s family.</p><p>&ldquo;You think we&rsquo;ll spend Christmas together next year?&rdquo; Dan asked quietly, folding a t-shirt and setting it in his case. The question came up every year. It always felt odd to spend so much of their time together only to part for the holidays. Dan was spending a few days with Phil&rsquo;s family up North and returning to his hometown just in time for Christmas Day, but it was still strange to him that the two of them weren&rsquo;t able to be together on Christmas Day. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just tough getting our families together, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked, as he always did in reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan agreed with a soft sigh, knowing there was nothing that could be done about it tonight. &ldquo;You know, this won&rsquo;t fly when we&rsquo;re married,&rdquo; he said, lacing his tone with humor that was just a little forced.</p><p>Phil smiled in a sad sort of way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll figure it out by then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it sound so far away,&rdquo; Dan said softly. Sometimes this stupid marriage thing felt like a dream where as soon as they got close to it, it moved further away.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan, frowning a little.</p><p>Dan sighed. &ldquo;I just&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s just the holidays, I guess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It always feels weird to not, like&hellip;you know, be a family around Christmas.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t look over at Phil as he shoved pairs of socks into the pocket of his suitcase.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes were on Dan, however. He thought of the small box containing two rings that were hidden away in the flat, somewhere Dan wouldn&rsquo;t stumble upon it. Maybe he should have gotten it. Should have given it to Dan right then as a reassurance of his intentions. Maybe he should have gone and grabbed it so they could bring it up North with them and he could give it to Dan there.</p><p>It was Christmas, though. And Dan and Phil were going to Phil&rsquo;s parents, and then Dan to his. Though Dan and Phil liked to think of themselves as already engaged, the rings would look and feel like a proposal, a more official one than the few they had shared. They deserved to have that moment by itself with nothing else to take from it.</p><p>Dan was folding his clothing a bit faster now, shoving it into his case a bit harder, his jaw tense.</p><p>Phil sat on the bed. &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he murmured.</p><p>Dan paused and looked over at Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Next year,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You better make good on that, Lester,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I always keep my promises,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;Debatable,&rdquo; Dan answered with a small grin.</p><p>Phil threw a pair of underwear at Dan. &ldquo;I do!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan grinned wider. &ldquo;Oh, you do, do you? Hmm, let&rsquo;s see. &lsquo;Oh, Dan, I won&rsquo;t leave the cupboard door opens anymore, promise,&rsquo; or&mdash;&rdquo; Phil threw another item of clothing at him and Dan giggled. &ldquo;&mdash;or &lsquo;oh, Dan, if you get the post today, I&rsquo;ll do it next time I promi&mdash;&rdquo; Dan was cut off when a pillow hit him in the face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the worst and I hate you,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>Dan just grinned. &ldquo;Well you promised to marry me, so sucks to suck,&rdquo; Dan said.</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Phil agreed with a smile. &ldquo;Pick up those clothes,&rdquo; Phil said, motioning to the clothes on the floor by Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, the clothes you threw onto the floor, sure yeah,&rdquo; Dan said, throwing a pair of underwear at Phil&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;I deserved that,&rdquo; he admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Dan mentioned, and it sounded a bit more sincere than Phil would have expected.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; Phil answered.</p><p>~&bull;~&bull;~</p><p><b>February 2019</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were walking down the same path by the beach again. Phil&rsquo;s birthday had been lovely, as usual. It was cozy and in the company of family, and all in all a nice time. Dan enjoyed the seclusion of the Lesters&rsquo; home even more than the times before today. They were enjoying being just them.</p><p>The last few years had been spent learning how to comfortably open themselves up. Now, they had an idea of where they were going career-wise and in the eyes of the public. The fear was gone. Or at least dulled a bit. And with no fear creating a wall between Dan and Phil and the eyes that watched them, it was time to relearn which moments not to share, which moments would just be theirs. Dan himself had decided to just be his for a while. So, it went without saying that this trip was theirs.</p><p>Last year, walking down this path, they thought about how they were basically a year into being engaged. They&rsquo;d talked about the year they were embarking on. A World Tour. There was no time for life plans, and they didn&rsquo;t mind it as much as they had expected. For a year, the Dan and Phil of everyday life were the same as Entertainer Dan and Phil. Most of the time, Entertainer Dan and Phil is what Dan and Phil wanted to be. And so, they loved it. They loved standing in front of people who adored them for reasons Dan and Phil didn&rsquo;t always understand, hearing rooms of people laugh because of something they said, meeting people who said that Dan and Phil made them happy, made them feel safe, gave them a community. They loved this family. Their family was this huge, messy, family of people who watched their content to be entertained and the two weirdos who created said content.</p><p>This year, they walked down the path, they thought about how they were basically two years engaged. They realized that they were back to a family of two again. Entertainer and everyday life had to find a balance again. They were home. They had time for life stuff. Dan wanted that life stuff more than he ever had before, and he knew Phil wanted it to.</p><p>Phil turned to the right and Dan followed as he walked down onto the beach, sitting on the sand. Dan didn&rsquo;t say anything, sitting beside him. The silence laid over them like a blanket, and Dan wasn&rsquo;t ready to peak his head out yet. It was comforting to be with someone without feeling the need to perform, to talk, to be interesting. Dan supposed that was one of the reasons he and Phil worked so well. Neither of them ever had to be interesting around each other. They could go for hours just listening to one and other breathe, or, as Phil was doing, taking in the way the other looked.</p><p>Dan looked out to the ocean, but Phil knew he could tell Phil was looking at him. Their eyes on one and other felt normal, comforting. They quite liked to look at each other. And Phil was quite liking looking at Dan as it was. Dan&rsquo;s hood was down, and his hair was a mess of curls, the wind playing with it, tangling it. When they returned to the house, Phil would run his fingers through it and untangle it. His cheeks were flushed pink from the cold, the one spot on his cheek almost red.</p><p>Phil gripped the box in his coat pocket with his left hand and took in a breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I have something for you,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p><p>Dan looked over. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked, smiling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s for me too,&rdquo; he said. He pulled the box out of his pocket and set it on the beach between them. Phil could tell the second Dan realized. He flicked his eyes up to meet Phil&rsquo;s, almost hesitant.</p><p>&ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; Phil murmured.</p><p>Dan bit his lip, reaching out his left hand to take the lid off the box. He held his breath, letting it out all at once when he saw the two rings. He&rsquo;d seen one before, on a LED screen, after spending hours picking it out for Phil. The other was new. It was gorgeous. It complimented the one Dan had picked out for Phil. The intertwining ring setting ended in leaves which surrounded a dark jewel. (<a href=\"https://www.brilliantearth.com/custom-rings/Solitaire-Leaf-Ring-1154259/\">link</a>)</p><p>Dan felt tears well in his eyes. It was strange how two shiny pieces of jewelry could make so much emotion well in Dan&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>Phil watched Dan&rsquo;s reaction, smiling a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;uh,&rdquo; Dan started, going to touch one of the rings. &ldquo;That one&rsquo;s mine?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil reached to grab the ring from the box. He held it between his fingers and offered it out. &ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Dan replied, voice barely a breath. He held out his left hand for Phil. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was shaking due to the emotion, the cold air, or a combination of both. Phil slid the engagement ring onto Dan&rsquo;s ring finger and Dan felt tears leak from the sides of his eyes as he watched it take its place resting snugly at the base of Dan&rsquo;s previously naked ring finger. Dan held his hand out, looking at it. He choked on a sob, laughing a little at the silliness of the overwhelming emotion. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he breathed.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to start planning our wedding,&rdquo; Phil said, and Dan had been aching to ask the same of Phil. Christmas and Phil&rsquo;s birthday and work had stopped him, but he was so glad Phil asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Dan said, voice broken with the emotion. He moved the box aside and moved closer, leaning in to hug Phil tightly, burying his face in Phil&rsquo;s neck, shoving off the hood he wore. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil held Dan back just as tightly, and they breathed each other in, held each other close, let the reality of the words Phil had just spoken sink in. Phil breathed out shakily, holding Dan a bit tighter, feeling tears well in his own eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting married,&rdquo; he breathed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan answered, laughing through his tears. &ldquo;For real this time.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed a little too. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed. He pulled back to look him in the eyes. &ldquo;For real. As soon as we get home, I want to find a venue. We&rsquo;re going to book a date.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan smiled, a few tears slipping down his cheeks. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he realized, sniffling a little. &ldquo;Let me&ndash;&rdquo; He reached to grab the box, taking out the ring he had picked out for Phil months and months ago. &ldquo;Can I?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiled, himself sniffling a bit as he offered his left hand to Dan. Dan slid the ring onto Phil&rsquo;s ring finger. He compared their two left hands. &ldquo;There. We match.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan smiled, looking down at his engagement ring. &ldquo;I never want to take this off,&rdquo; he admitted.</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t have everything worked out. In fact, they didn&rsquo;t have much of anything worked out. They didn&rsquo;t know how they were going to manage their marriage and engagement publicly. They didn&rsquo;t know if they would announce it or lead up to it or quietly allow it to happen without much conversation by them. They didn&rsquo;t know if they would have to take the ring off when they sat in front of cameras and for how long. No doubt they would spend hours and hours talking it through and asking advice and getting unsure and frustrated.</p><p>But none of that mattered because this was the first step. And Dan and Phil were definitely going to book that venue. Dan was thinking of April next year. Phil was picturing Dan in an over-the-top white suit. Dan was thinking about writing vows. Phil was wondering about wedding bands. The two of them were getting married.</p><p>So, for now, Phil said, &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17623067/chapters/41549267\">Ao3 Link</a></p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Chapter Three</b><br/></p><p>Mr Novokoric doesn\u2019t cross paths with Dan for the rest of the day, so Dan doesn\u2019t get a second opportunity to gawp at an entitled semi-celebrity, not that he has much of a desire to, after their first encounter. It\u2019s probably for the best that Dan avoids him for a while, given that he\u2019s still shimmering with rage. How was he supposed to know that this man is some sort of Royal exception to the hotel rules? Just because he made a mistake doesn\u2019t mean he deserved to be talked to with such&hellip; <i>disdain</i>.\u00a0</p><p>So, devoid of any further unpleasant - albeit unnervingly handsome - strangers, the rest of Dan\u2019s third day passes without much to note. Mona had been right about the days here being pretty much the same. He imagines it will soon become hard to distinguish one day from the next. He\u2019ll have to use the evening film as a marker so he can remember which days he did what, though that won\u2019t be easy either, as Mona has an apparent love for heist movies, which aren\u2019t known for their vastly dissimilar plots.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>Dan heads to bed weary, wondering how long it will take to fall into a routine, so he can drift through the days without thinking. As he fumbles for his key, he notes the light on in the next room again, and pauses. <i>He spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.</i> If Mr Novo-dick is really in the room next to his, then that presumably means the music Dan has been hearing is coming from him. At least that means Dan isn\u2019t developing a slow schizophrenia, but it does seem odd. Dan wouldn\u2019t have had the man who shouted at him this morning pegged as a Chopin enthusiast. </p><p>Putting it to the back of his mind for now, Dan goes inside and gets ready for bed, only realising he\u2019s being especially quiet when he\u2019s already in his pyjamas, sat under the covers, ears staining to hear something above the silence. As the wait stretches on, Dan feels the familiar weight of his own guilt, failure and misery closing in, and soon the first of his tears begin to drip from his lashes. Soon, he is full on sniffling, eyes streaming, mouth pulled down in an unattractive curl. </p><p>And like clockwork, a melody begins, drifting slowly and calmly through the wooden wall. It\u2019s soothing and delicate, making Dan\u2019s sniffs lessen, and then stop altogether. He sighs in relief, settling back into his pillows, and lets the music buffet him gently into a long, deep sleep.</p><p>*</p><p>The next couple of days pass in a similar vein. Dan is woken early by the extreme light pouring into his room. He drags himself downstairs and into the kitchen, where Louise teases him for ten minutes straight while he drinks the coffee she makes him, and eats whatever delicious food she\u2019s prepared. He sets up for breakfast out on the balcony with Mona, and serves the four guests that attend, all of whom tell him he\u2019s a \u2018charming\u2019 and \u2018polite\u2019 young man.\u00a0</p><p>In the intervening hours between breakfast and lunch, he cleans the guests\u2019 bedrooms and changes the beds, tidies the communal areas, and if he\u2019s feeling brave, goes outside to sweep the area around the hot tub and wipe down the benches in the sauna. He and Mona then serve lunch, eat whatever Louise has left over, then do a general stock take. After that, they serve dinner, eat dinner, and finally set up the evening film. During any downtime, Dan sits at the front desk, answering the phone when it occasionally rings, booking in new guests, or granting the requests of current ones. At the end of the long days, Dan falls onto his bed, sometimes managing to worm out of his clothes, sometimes not, and makes a valiant attempt at crying himself to sleep. Inevitably however, that light, classical music starts up before he can get too lost in his own sadness, and he finds himself floating away with it, his cheeks sticky with dried tears when he wakes up the next morning, ready to repeat the whole thing again. </p><p>He\u2019s never exactly rushed off his feet, but he rarely has time to be bored, apart from late in the evening, when Mona leaves him at the desk, and he wiles away the hours until his shift ends playing on his phone, or reading one of the books left for guests on the mezzanine lounge. </p><p>For three days, Dan doesn\u2019t speak again with Mr Novokoric, though he does glimpse a flash of crimson from his window each morning, and occasionally catches sight of him wandering through the hotel, on his way back from the hot tub, or clasping a cup of coffee as he sneaks back into his room. On his fifth day, Dan watched from the desk as Mr Stevens - a middle aged guest with a receding hairline and an aversion to wearing anything except a robe - accost Mr Novokoric in the lobby to discuss the weather. Somewhat hilariously, Mr Novokoric appeared to be too polite to simply turn his back on the man, and had stood for eight patient minutes, responding in short, stunted sentences, and looking extremely uncomfortable. It had been the highlight of Dan\u2019s day. </p><p>On Saturday, Dan\u2019s seventh day, just before noon, Dan is sat at the front desk, wondering if Louise might have finished making lunch yet, and if he could go up and see, when the front door slams open, and Mr Novokoric hurtles through it, still wearing his skis. Dan can only watch, mouth agape, as the man awkwardly but determinedly slides his way into the lobby before reaching down, muttering angrily, and undoing the skis one at a time. He then proceeds to kick each one hard, sending them skittering across the wooden floor, and into the far wall. It\u2019s reckless, idiotic behaviour, and if it had been anyone else, Dan would not have hesitated to call them out on it. The skis are heavy, and the walls are made of wood, for christ\u2019s sake. Dan can see the chips they\u2019ve made from all the way across the room. </p><p>Mr Novokoric does not, apparently, care about this. He marches across the room towards Dan, pulling off his thick gloves and tossing them to the floor as he goes. If he thinks Dan is picking them up for him he can forget about it. By the time Mr Novokoric is at the desk, Dan\u2019s mouth is a set line, and he\u2019s having trouble keeping himself from curling his fingers into fists. </p><p>\u201cSir, is there something the matter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to use your phone,\u201d Mr Novokoric barks. \u201cNow.\u201d </p><p>Dan thinks about saying no, or refusing, mostly because he wants to piss this asshole off, but his years of customer service training override his petulance. \u201cCertainly, Sir,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, then reaches underneath the desk, and lifts the corded telephone up onto it. \u201cGo right ahead.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric snatches the receiver at once, and immediately begins punching in numbers with such vigorous jabbing motions that Dan fears for the keys. He lifts the receiver to his ear, fingers drumming restlessly on the lip of the desk. He turns to Dan, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there and listen to my private call?\u201d </p><p>Heat surges into Dan\u2019s cheeks, mostly born of the intense anger that sweeps through him. He doesn\u2019t trust himself to reply, so he simply turns from the sight of the man in front of him, and begins pretending to be engrossed in the guest information database on the hotel\u2019s only ancient computer. </p><p>For a moment, Dan can still feel eyes on him, and is convinced he\u2019s about to be shouted at further, but then he hears Mr Novokoric\u2019s voice say \u201cabout bloody time!\u201d </p><p>The voice on the other end of the line, which Dan can just about hear, replies, \u201cwho is this?\u201d </p><p>Dan has to hide his smirk in his hand. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your husband, you wank-stain,\u201d comes Mr Novokoric\u2019s hushed, furious response, which has Dan\u2019s eyebrows shooting up his forehead. \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised you don\u2019t recognise my voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d the disembodied voice says, vaguely. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the number you were calling from a minute ago.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s taking an extreme amount of effort for Dan to keep his eyes fixed on the screen in front of him. He tries valiantly to appear as though he\u2019s engrossed in reading the Stevens\u2019 guest information. It seems that under \u2018special requests\u2019, Mr and Mrs Stevens had asked for \u2018an extra robe each\u2019. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you pissed me off so much that I dropped my phone down a mountain!\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause in the conversation, and then the responding voice says, a touch amusedly, \u201ca little harsh to blame me for that, darling. What could I possibly have said that would upset you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset because you cancelled on me, <i>again</i>!\u201d Mr Novokoric snaps. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Nikolai. How long are you going to leave me up here at the peak of Mount-fucking-Whatever? Are you playing out some warped, Rapunzel love story for the media?\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s something vaguely pathetic lurking beneath Mr Novokoric\u2019s words. Dan squints at the screen, not seeing it, and strains to hear whatever is being said on the other end of the line. </p><p>\u201cDarling, you know I\u2019d have you with me in a heartbeat if I could,\u201d the voice says, sounding slow and distracted. \u201cI\u2019ve just been drowning in all these meetings and dull media-stints. You\u2019d be bored stiff if you were here. It won\u2019t be much longer. There\u2019s that benefit thingy in a week or so, right? You should probably come along to that. I\u2019ll send the helicopter to collect you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh I should <i>probably</i> come, should I?\u201d Mr Novokoric snarls. \u201cGood to know that, as we\u2019re married, it\u2019s <i>probably</i> a good idea for us to be together at least one fucking night of the year. You know, most married couples actually live in the same house. We\u2019re not even in the same country most of the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best that you stay out of the public eye for a bit, Phil. We\u2019ve spoken about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, Nik, you said you\u2019d take a few days off to spend some time with me-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI have to go, darling, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the voice says. Dan might be imagining it, but he thinks he hears a splashing noise, followed by a shriek of laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a week.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise? Nikolai, are you in the Ibiza apartment again-\u201d</p><p>He cuts off as the dull note of the dial tone replaces the other person\u2019s voice. Dan chews the inside of his cheek, and sneaks a glance up as Mr Novokoric places the receiver down, slowly, and turns to lean against the desk. At first, Dan is smug; he wishes he were able to hang up so brutally on him, but on closer inspection, he notices that Mr Novokoric actually appears to be crying. At least, his bright blue eyes are glistening. Traitorously, Dan\u2019s good nature wins out, and he feels his heart squeeze in dumb sympathy. Dick-brain or not, Dan can\u2019t just sit by while a guest he\u2019s employed to look after cries right beside him. He plucks the box of tissues from the shelf behind him. </p><p>\u201cEx-excuse me, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan says, swallowing a wash of pride for getting the name right on his first out-loud try. He holds out the box of tissues even though the other man doesn\u2019t acknowledge him. \u201cHere, take these.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns to Dan coldly, snatching the box from him. \u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d he insists, but yanks a tissue from the box anyway, scrubbing it over his face. </p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Dan says, nodding in complete agreement with this outright lie. He really is an absurdly patient and talented customer service worker. \u201cI just thought\u2026\u201d he scrambles for a viable explanation. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you but I think the, er, high altitude of this place does something weird to my sinuses. I\u2019m blubbering every night,\u201d he jokes, thinking that the peppering of truth might give his ramble a little weight.\u00a0</p><p>It would be so easy, Dan thinks, for Mr Novokoric to accept Dan\u2019s fumbling excuse for the offer of tissues, to blame the thin air for his tears and never speak about it again. But evidently the man has a defensive arsenal so loaded and precarious it can be triggered with the slightest wrong step. </p><p>So, Mr Novokoric\u2019s expression hardens, and he says, \u201cso it\u2019s you that I can hear wailing on the other side of my wall, is it? You should keep these for yourself.\u201d He shoves the tissues back into Dan\u2019s hands. \u201cMaybe then I&rsquo;ll actually get some sleep.\u201d </p><p>Like he\u2019s been whipped, Dan shrinks back, attempting to swallow the burning lump of coal now lodged in his throat. Any response he might have had, stupidly kind or not, dies on his tongue. For a split second, he imagines he sees a flash of regret pass over Mr Novokoric\u2019s features, but then he is stalking away, skis lying forgotten against the wall, and stomping up the stairs. Dan sits heavily down in his chair, and tries not to let the flames of angry, hurt humiliation burn him to ash. </p><p>*</p><p>That night, Dan does his best to muffle his sobs in his pillow. They\u2019re worse tonight, because the embarrassment of knowing he\u2019s being heard, that he\u2019s been heard this whole time, only makes him feel worse. If he could halt the tears altogether for Mr Novokoric\u2019s sake he would, but nightfall has always been the time where his resolve leaves him. With nothing to distract him, Dan can only dwell on everything that\u2019s wrong. At ten past one, however, the music seems to know to start up anyway; it\u2019s baffling, obviously, but the only explanation Dan can think of is that the music is either unrelated to Dan\u2019s crying, or being played to drown it out. He tries not to be grateful for it, knows that before long he\u2019ll rely on it to send him off, but in the end he can\u2019t help letting the swells of notes wash over him, and press him into unconsciousness. </p><p>*</p><p>Just after lunch has been cleared on Sunday, Dan is caught in a pleasant but rather over-detailed discussion with Mr and Mrs Stevens about their show-dog, Sherbet, when Louise calls him over from the serving hatch. He excuses himself politely, leaving the middle-aged couple to their game of Uno, and walks up to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you today?\u201d she asks as soon as he\u2019s within earshot, then places a mug of coffee in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a face like a trodden foot.\u201d </p><p>He manages a smile, but he doubts it\u2019s very convincing. \u201cJust tired,\u201d he says, picking up the mug. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She slaps his wrist, and he almost spills some. \u201cThat\u2019s not for you, foot-face.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He lowers it, glancing back at the Stevens\u2019s. \u201cDid they order\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Phil,\u201d she says, briskly wiping up the coffee Dan spilled with a wad of kitchen roll. For a moment, Dan just looks at her blankly, and she raises an eyebrow. \u201cMr Novokoric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, and smartly places the mug back down, stomach squeezing. </p><p>For whatever reason, his abrupt action makes Louise laugh. \u201cChrist, he\u2019s not a yeti, Dan. Anyway, he\u2019s been looking for you all morning, so I thought you could take this to him.\u201d </p><p>Exhausted as he is, it takes the words a few tries to penetrate Dan\u2019s addled mind. \u201cWait, what?\u201d he asks eventually, sure he must have misheard. \u201cLooking for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Louise replies, like this is a perfectly normal occurence. \u201cMona mentioned it earlier. Apparently he was hoping to catch you at breakfast but you weren\u2019t serving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I was adjusting the chlorine levels in the hot tub,\u201d Dan says, feeling as though he\u2019s stood on the edge of a crumbling cliff. Mr Novokoric is looking for him, specifically? Had he not made Dan feel awful enough yesterday? Is he looking for another chance to brutally attack his ego for a trivial reason? \u201cDo I have to take this to him?\u201d</p><p>Louise looks at him strangely. \u201cAre you scared of him or something? I know he\u2019s technically Royalty, but he\u2019s just a regular guy underneath, Dan. Not much older than you. I know it\u2019s a bit daunting at first, but don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s pretty chill.\u201d</p><p>This makes Dan snort. \u201cI\u2019ll try and remember that next time he\u2019s verbally abusing me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a hot-head at times,\u201d Louise allows. \u201cI remember my first few encounters with him being on the snippy side. You\u2019ve just got to get past that though, he doesn\u2019t mean it. I just think he\u2019s a bit\u2026 frustrated.\u201d This makes Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot up his forehead, and Louise laughs at her own phrasing. \u201cNot like that. Well, maybe like that. I mean, he\u2019s here for weeks at a time, supposedly having ensnared this fabulous young hottie. But where is this prize pig, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIbiza,\u201d Dan mutters, and when Louise sends him a puzzled look, he picks up the coffee mug, sensing defeat. \u201cWhere am I taking this, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe was heading for the gym, last I saw.\u201d Louise watches him make his way towards the stairs, being extra careful not to spill any coffee lest he feel the wrath upon its delivery. \u201cDan?\u201d she calls out, making him pause. \u201cBe nice, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i> be nice?\u201d Dan exclaims, and turns to shoot her an incredulous look, but Louise\u2019s expression is unmoved.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust let him say what he\u2019s got to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him belittle me, you mean?\u201d </p><p>Louise sighs heavily, turning away from him, and Dan is left in the middle of the mezzanine with a steaming mug of coffee, and a niggling sense that there\u2019s still some great secret etched into the wooden walls of this place that he still hasn\u2019t been entirely privy to. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan has only been in the gym once, on his first day, which is a perfect allegory for his entire mentality around gyms in general. From outside the door, he can hear a rhythmic pounding noise, like someone is punching the shit out of something. It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that as he enters the gym, he sees Mr Novokoric in the corner by the mirrors, punching the shit out of a big cylindrical bag. For obvious reasons, this sight does not instil Dan with a desperate urge to go over and interact with Mr Novokoric, who is wearing headphones, and appears not to have noticed Dan come in. </p><p>Giving him a wide berth, Dan slowly approaches, intending to place the mug of coffee down on a nearby surface and escape quickly before Mr Novokoric has the chance to either hit him or yell at him some more. Instead, what happens is this: Dan attempts to edge along the wall to put the coffee down, and at the same moment, Mr Novokoric draws back his elbow and catches Dan in the arm, jolting him. Louise makes a good cup of coffee, Dan will admit. As it soaks through the fabric of his shirt sleeve, however, he can\u2019t help but wish it was a little less scalding. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan shouts, just as Mr Novokoric jumps back in surprise, ripping his headphones from his ears. He\u2019s panting and damp, strands of his jet black hair sticking to his forehead, making it look like he\u2019s got a stupid noughties side-fringe. </p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Mr Novokoric exclaims, as if Dan hasn\u2019t already done the stupid thing. Surprisingly, he takes the mug of hot coffee from Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes out his sleeve, wincing. \u201cI\u2019ll live. Sorry for startling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should announce yourself next time,\u201d he says, like a wanker. Like Dan calling out\u00a0\u2018whaddup it\u2019s me your boy Dan\u2019 would have done any good at all when he was blaring what Dan thinks is&hellip; Fall Out Boy? Really?&hellip; through his headphones. \u201cI could have really hurt you.\u201d </p><p>Doubtful of this statement, Dan\u2019s eyes flick down to Mr Novokoric\u2019s biceps. Begrudgingly, as he surveys the shallow valleys of his arm muscles, Dan admits to himself that out of the two of them, there\u2019s no question of who would best the other. Dan\u2019s never been more glad of his own long sleeves.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan mutters, wanting nothing more than to scurry away to his room and recover from this incident with the excuse of changing his wet shirt. \u201cSorry, Sir. Won\u2019t happen again. Enjoy your coffee.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says as Dan turns to go. \u201cI wanted to speak with you.\u201d </p><p>Oh, God. It\u2019s true. Louise wasn\u2019t pulling his leg, it seems. Dan seriously considers just legging it. He could potentially feign a third degree burn from the coffee and sprint back through the doors. \u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Dan says, his own cowardice feeling vaguely nauseating as it curdles in his stomach. \u201cShe mentioned.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYesterday, when I used the phone at reception-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I\u2019ve been keeping you awake,\u201d Dan blurts, badly needing this to be over <i>now</i>. \u201cI never meant to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d Mr Novokoric says, which stuns Dan into silence. For a minute, all he can do is stare into those two darting blue eyes, utterly perplexed. Mr Novokoric sips his coffee self-consciously. \u201cIt was rude and completely unacceptable for me to hone in on something so personal. I have no idea what your circumstances might be. I was upset, and I lashed out. So,\u201d he sticks his hand out, awkwardly, into the space between them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Can we put it behind us?\u201d </p><p>Dan stares at his outstretched hand as if it were a foreign beast. Then, belatedly remembering societal norms, he reaches out and takes it. \u201cW-well, I suppose-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Mr Novokoric says, shaking Dan\u2019s hand quickly, once, up and down, and then dropping it like it\u2019s coated in poison.\u00a0</p><p>Dan stares at Mr Novokoric\u2019s back as he sets the coffee down and pulls his gloves back on. Could it be that there\u2019s a shade of decency to this man? Not once did it cross Dan\u2019s mind that the reason he might be looking for Dan was to <i>apologise</i>. </p><p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Dan echoes softly, and Mr Novokoric turns, eyebrows raised, as if he\u2019s surprised Dan is still standing there. </p><p>\u201cYou can go now,\u201d he says, puzzled, and turns his back. </p><p>All thoughts that Mr Novokoric is anything less than a rude, entitled bitch flies out of the gym window. Dan rolls his eyes, shaking his sleeve dry as he turns to leave. </p><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">(Chapter Four!)</a></b></p>",

Mona had been right about the days here being pretty much the same. He imagines it will soon become hard to distinguish one day from the next. He\u2019ll have to use the evening film as a marker so he can remember which days he did what, though that won\u2019t be easy either, as Mona has an apparent love for heist movies, which aren\u2019t known for their vastly dissimilar plots.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan heads to bed weary, wondering how long it will take to fall into a routine, so he can drift through the days without thinking. As he fumbles for his key, he notes the light on in the next room again, and pauses. <i>He spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.</i> If Mr Novo-dick is really in the room next to his, then that presumably means the music Dan has been hearing is coming from him. At least that means Dan isn\u2019t developing a slow schizophrenia, but it does seem odd. Dan wouldn\u2019t have had the man who shouted at him this morning pegged as a Chopin enthusiast. </p><p>Putting it to the back of his mind for now, Dan goes inside and gets ready for bed, only realising he\u2019s being especially quiet when he\u2019s already in his pyjamas, sat under the covers, ears staining to hear something above the silence. As the wait stretches on, Dan feels the familiar weight of his own guilt, failure and misery closing in, and soon the first of his tears begin to drip from his lashes. Soon, he is full on sniffling, eyes streaming, mouth pulled down in an unattractive curl. </p><p>And like clockwork, a melody begins, drifting slowly and calmly through the wooden wall. It\u2019s soothing and delicate, making Dan\u2019s sniffs lessen, and then stop altogether. He sighs in relief, settling back into his pillows, and lets the music buffet him gently into a long, deep sleep.</p><p>*</p><p>The next couple of days pass in a similar vein. Dan is woken early by the extreme light pouring into his room. He drags himself downstairs and into the kitchen, where Louise teases him for ten minutes straight while he drinks the coffee she makes him, and eats whatever delicious food she\u2019s prepared. He sets up for breakfast out on the balcony with Mona, and serves the four guests that attend, all of whom tell him he\u2019s a \u2018charming\u2019 and \u2018polite\u2019 young man.\u00a0</p><p>In the intervening hours between breakfast and lunch, he cleans the guests\u2019 bedrooms and changes the beds, tidies the communal areas, and if he\u2019s feeling brave, goes outside to sweep the area around the hot tub and wipe down the benches in the sauna. He and Mona then serve lunch, eat whatever Louise has left over, then do a general stock take. After that, they serve dinner, eat dinner, and finally set up the evening film. During any downtime, Dan sits at the front desk, answering the phone when it occasionally rings, booking in new guests, or granting the requests of current ones. At the end of the long days, Dan falls onto his bed, sometimes managing to worm out of his clothes, sometimes not, and makes a valiant attempt at crying himself to sleep. Inevitably however, that light, classical music starts up before he can get too lost in his own sadness, and he finds himself floating away with it, his cheeks sticky with dried tears when he wakes up the next morning, ready to repeat the whole thing again. </p><p>He\u2019s never exactly rushed off his feet, but he rarely has time to be bored, apart from late in the evening, when Mona leaves him at the desk, and he wiles away the hours until his shift ends playing on his phone, or reading one of the books left for guests on the mezzanine lounge. </p><p>For three days, Dan doesn\u2019t speak again with Mr Novokoric, though he does glimpse a flash of crimson from his window each morning, and occasionally catches sight of him wandering through the hotel, on his way back from the hot tub, or clasping a cup of coffee as he sneaks back into his room. On his fifth day, Dan watched from the desk as Mr Stevens - a middle aged guest with a receding hairline and an aversion to wearing anything except a robe - accost Mr Novokoric in the lobby to discuss the weather. Somewhat hilariously, Mr Novokoric appeared to be too polite to simply turn his back on the man, and had stood for eight patient minutes, responding in short, stunted sentences, and looking extremely uncomfortable. It had been the highlight of Dan\u2019s day. </p><p>On Saturday, Dan\u2019s seventh day, just before noon, Dan is sat at the front desk, wondering if Louise might have finished making lunch yet, and if he could go up and see, when the front door slams open, and Mr Novokoric hurtles through it, still wearing his skis. Dan can only watch, mouth agape, as the man awkwardly but determinedly slides his way into the lobby before reaching down, muttering angrily, and undoing the skis one at a time. He then proceeds to kick each one hard, sending them skittering across the wooden floor, and into the far wall. It\u2019s reckless, idiotic behaviour, and if it had been anyone else, Dan would not have hesitated to call them out on it. The skis are heavy, and the walls are made of wood, for christ\u2019s sake. Dan can see the chips they\u2019ve made from all the way across the room. </p><p>Mr Novokoric does not, apparently, care about this. He marches across the room towards Dan, pulling off his thick gloves and tossing them to the floor as he goes. If he thinks Dan is picking them up for him he can forget about it. By the time Mr Novokoric is at the desk, Dan\u2019s mouth is a set line, and he\u2019s having trouble keeping himself from curling his fingers into fists. </p><p>\u201cSir, is there something the matter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to use your phone,\u201d Mr Novokoric barks. \u201cNow.\u201d </p><p>Dan thinks about saying no, or refusing, mostly because he wants to piss this asshole off, but his years of customer service training override his petulance. \u201cCertainly, Sir,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, then reaches underneath the desk, and lifts the corded telephone up onto it. \u201cGo right ahead.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric snatches the receiver at once, and immediately begins punching in numbers with such vigorous jabbing motions that Dan fears for the keys. He lifts the receiver to his ear, fingers drumming restlessly on the lip of the desk. He turns to Dan, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there and listen to my private call?\u201d </p><p>Heat surges into Dan\u2019s cheeks, mostly born of the intense anger that sweeps through him. He doesn\u2019t trust himself to reply, so he simply turns from the sight of the man in front of him, and begins pretending to be engrossed in the guest information database on the hotel\u2019s only ancient computer. </p><p>For a moment, Dan can still feel eyes on him, and is convinced he\u2019s about to be shouted at further, but then he hears Mr Novokoric\u2019s voice say \u201cabout bloody time!\u201d </p><p>The voice on the other end of the line, which Dan can just about hear, replies, \u201cwho is this?\u201d </p><p>Dan has to hide his smirk in his hand. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your husband, you wank-stain,\u201d comes Mr Novokoric\u2019s hushed, furious response, which has Dan\u2019s eyebrows shooting up his forehead. \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised you don\u2019t recognise my voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d the disembodied voice says, vaguely. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the number you were calling from a minute ago.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s taking an extreme amount of effort for Dan to keep his eyes fixed on the screen in front of him. He tries valiantly to appear as though he\u2019s engrossed in reading the Stevens\u2019 guest information. It seems that under \u2018special requests\u2019, Mr and Mrs Stevens had asked for \u2018an extra robe each\u2019. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you pissed me off so much that I dropped my phone down a mountain!\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause in the conversation, and then the responding voice says, a touch amusedly, \u201ca little harsh to blame me for that, darling. What could I possibly have said that would upset you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset because you cancelled on me, <i>again</i>!\u201d Mr Novokoric snaps. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Nikolai. How long are you going to leave me up here at the peak of Mount-fucking-Whatever? Are you playing out some warped, Rapunzel love story for the media?\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s something vaguely pathetic lurking beneath Mr Novokoric\u2019s words. Dan squints at the screen, not seeing it, and strains to hear whatever is being said on the other end of the line. </p><p>\u201cDarling, you know I\u2019d have you with me in a heartbeat if I could,\u201d the voice says, sounding slow and distracted. \u201cI\u2019ve just been drowning in all these meetings and dull media-stints. You\u2019d be bored stiff if you were here. It won\u2019t be much longer. There\u2019s that benefit thingy in a week or so, right? You should probably come along to that. I\u2019ll send the helicopter to collect you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh I should <i>probably</i> come, should I?\u201d Mr Novokoric snarls. \u201cGood to know that, as we\u2019re married, it\u2019s <i>probably</i> a good idea for us to be together at least one fucking night of the year. You know, most married couples actually live in the same house. We\u2019re not even in the same country most of the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best that you stay out of the public eye for a bit, Phil. We\u2019ve spoken about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, Nik, you said you\u2019d take a few days off to spend some time with me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI have to go, darling, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the voice says. Dan might be imagining it, but he thinks he hears a splashing noise, followed by a shriek of laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a week.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise? Nikolai, are you in the Ibiza apartment again-\u201d</p><p>He cuts off as the dull note of the dial tone replaces the other person\u2019s voice. Dan chews the inside of his cheek, and sneaks a glance up as Mr Novokoric places the receiver down, slowly, and turns to lean against the desk. At first, Dan is smug; he wishes he were able to hang up so brutally on him, but on closer inspection, he notices that Mr Novokoric actually appears to be crying. At least, his bright blue eyes are glistening. Traitorously, Dan\u2019s good nature wins out, and he feels his heart squeeze in dumb sympathy. Dick-brain or not, Dan can\u2019t just sit by while a guest he\u2019s employed to look after cries right beside him. He plucks the box of tissues from the shelf behind him. </p><p>\u201cEx-excuse me, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan says, swallowing a wash of pride for getting the name right on his first out-loud try. He holds out the box of tissues even though the other man doesn\u2019t acknowledge him. \u201cHere, take these.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns to Dan coldly, snatching the box from him. \u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d he insists, but yanks a tissue from the box anyway, scrubbing it over his face. </p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Dan says, nodding in complete agreement with this outright lie. He really is an absurdly patient and talented customer service worker. \u201cI just thought\u2026\u201d he scrambles for a viable explanation. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you but I think the, er, high altitude of this place does something weird to my sinuses. I\u2019m blubbering every night,\u201d he jokes, thinking that the peppering of truth might give his ramble a little weight.\u00a0</p><p>It would be so easy, Dan thinks, for Mr Novokoric to accept Dan\u2019s fumbling excuse for the offer of tissues, to blame the thin air for his tears and never speak about it again. But evidently the man has a defensive arsenal so loaded and precarious it can be triggered with the slightest wrong step. </p><p>So, Mr Novokoric\u2019s expression hardens, and he says, \u201cso it\u2019s you that I can hear wailing on the other side of my wall, is it? You should keep these for yourself.\u201d He shoves the tissues back into Dan\u2019s hands. \u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll actually get some sleep.\u201d </p><p>Like he\u2019s been whipped, Dan shrinks back, attempting to swallow the burning lump of coal now lodged in his throat. Any response he might have had, stupidly kind or not, dies on his tongue. For a split second, he imagines he sees a flash of regret pass over Mr Novokoric\u2019s features, but then he is stalking away, skis lying forgotten against the wall, and stomping up the stairs. Dan sits heavily down in his chair, and tries not to let the flames of angry, hurt humiliation burn him to ash. </p><p>*</p><p>That night, Dan does his best to muffle his sobs in his pillow. They\u2019re worse tonight, because the embarrassment of knowing he\u2019s being heard, that he\u2019s been heard this whole time, only makes him feel worse. If he could halt the tears altogether for Mr Novokoric\u2019s sake he would, but nightfall has always been the time where his resolve leaves him. With nothing to distract him, Dan can only dwell on everything that\u2019s wrong. At ten past one, however, the music seems to know to start up anyway; it\u2019s baffling, obviously, but the only explanation Dan can think of is that the music is either unrelated to Dan\u2019s crying, or being played to drown it out. He tries not to be grateful for it, knows that before long he\u2019ll rely on it to send him off, but in the end he can\u2019t help letting the swells of notes wash over him, and press him into unconsciousness. </p><p>*</p><p>Just after lunch has been cleared on Sunday, Dan is caught in a pleasant but rather over-detailed discussion with Mr and Mrs Stevens about their show-dog, Sherbet, when Louise calls him over from the serving hatch. He excuses himself politely, leaving the middle-aged couple to their game of Uno, and walks up to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you today?\u201d she asks as soon as he\u2019s within earshot, then places a mug of coffee in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a face like a trodden foot.\u201d </p><p>He manages a smile, but he doubts it\u2019s very convincing. \u201cJust tired,\u201d he says, picking up the mug. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She slaps his wrist, and he almost spills some. \u201cThat\u2019s not for you, foot-face.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He lowers it, glancing back at the Stevens\u2019s. \u201cDid they order\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Phil,\u201d she says, briskly wiping up the coffee Dan spilled with a wad of kitchen roll. For a moment, Dan just looks at her blankly, and she raises an eyebrow. \u201cMr Novokoric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, and smartly places the mug back down, stomach squeezing. </p><p>For whatever reason, his abrupt action makes Louise laugh. \u201cChrist, he\u2019s not a yeti, Dan. Anyway, he\u2019s been looking for you all morning, so I thought you could take this to him.\u201d </p><p>Exhausted as he is, it takes the words a few tries to penetrate Dan\u2019s addled mind. \u201cWait, what?\u201d he asks eventually, sure he must have misheard. \u201cLooking for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Louise replies, like this is a perfectly normal occurence. \u201cMona mentioned it earlier. Apparently he was hoping to catch you at breakfast but you weren\u2019t serving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I was adjusting the chlorine levels in the hot tub,\u201d Dan says, feeling as though he\u2019s stood on the edge of a crumbling cliff. Mr Novokoric is looking for him, specifically? Had he not made Dan feel awful enough yesterday? Is he looking for another chance to brutally attack his ego for a trivial reason? \u201cDo I have to take this to him?\u201d</p><p>Louise looks at him strangely. \u201cAre you scared of him or something? I know he\u2019s technically Royalty, but he\u2019s just a regular guy underneath, Dan. Not much older than you. I know it\u2019s a bit daunting at first, but don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s pretty chill.\u201d</p><p>This makes Dan snort. \u201cI\u2019ll try and remember that next time he\u2019s verbally abusing me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a hot-head at times,\u201d Louise allows. \u201cI remember my first few encounters with him being on the snippy side. You\u2019ve just got to get past that though, he doesn\u2019t mean it. I just think he\u2019s a bit\u2026 frustrated.\u201d This makes Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot up his forehead, and Louise laughs at her own phrasing. \u201cNot like that. Well, maybe like that. I mean, he\u2019s here for weeks at a time, supposedly having ensnared this fabulous young hottie. But where is this prize pig, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIbiza,\u201d Dan mutters, and when Louise sends him a puzzled look, he picks up the coffee mug, sensing defeat. \u201cWhere am I taking this, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe was heading for the gym, last I saw.\u201d Louise watches him make his way towards the stairs, being extra careful not to spill any coffee lest he feel the wrath upon its delivery. \u201cDan?\u201d she calls out, making him pause. \u201cBe nice, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i> be nice?\u201d Dan exclaims, and turns to shoot her an incredulous look, but Louise\u2019s expression is unmoved.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust let him say what he\u2019s got to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him belittle me, you mean?\u201d </p><p>Louise sighs heavily, turning away from him, and Dan is left in the middle of the mezzanine with a steaming mug of coffee, and a niggling sense that there\u2019s still some great secret etched into the wooden walls of this place that he still hasn\u2019t been entirely privy to. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan has only been in the gym once, on his first day, which is a perfect allegory for his entire mentality around gyms in general. From outside the door, he can hear a rhythmic pounding noise, like someone is punching the shit out of something. It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that as he enters the gym, he sees Mr Novokoric in the corner by the mirrors, punching the shit out of a big cylindrical bag. For obvious reasons, this sight does not instil Dan with a desperate urge to go over and interact with Mr Novokoric, who is wearing headphones, and appears not to have noticed Dan come in. </p><p>Giving him a wide berth, Dan slowly approaches, intending to place the mug of coffee down on a nearby surface and escape quickly before Mr Novokoric has the chance to either hit him or yell at him some more. Instead, what happens is this: Dan attempts to edge along the wall to put the coffee down, and at the same moment, Mr Novokoric draws back his elbow and catches Dan in the arm, jolting him. Louise makes a good cup of coffee, Dan will admit. As it soaks through the fabric of his shirt sleeve, however, he can\u2019t help but wish it was a little less scalding. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan shouts, just as Mr Novokoric jumps back in surprise, ripping his headphones from his ears. He\u2019s panting and damp, strands of his jet black hair sticking to his forehead, making it look like he\u2019s got a stupid noughties side-fringe. </p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Mr Novokoric exclaims, as if Dan hasn\u2019t already done the stupid thing. Surprisingly, he takes the mug of hot coffee from Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes out his sleeve, wincing. \u201cI\u2019ll live. Sorry for startling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should announce yourself next time,\u201d he says, like a wanker. Like Dan calling out\u00a0\u2018whaddup it\u2019s me your boy Dan\u2019 would have done any good at all when he was blaring what Dan thinks is\u2026 Fall Out Boy? Really?\u2026 through his headphones. \u201cI could have really hurt you.\u201d </p><p>Doubtful of this statement, Dan\u2019s eyes flick down to Mr Novokoric\u2019s biceps. Begrudgingly, as he surveys the shallow valleys of his arm muscles, Dan admits to himself that out of the two of them, there\u2019s no question of who would best the other. Dan\u2019s never been more glad of his own long sleeves.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan mutters, wanting nothing more than to scurry away to his room and recover from this incident with the excuse of changing his wet shirt. \u201cSorry, Sir. Won\u2019t happen again. Enjoy your coffee.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says as Dan turns to go. \u201cI wanted to speak with you.\u201d </p><p>Oh, God. It\u2019s true. Louise wasn\u2019t pulling his leg, it seems. Dan seriously considers just legging it. He could potentially feign a third degree burn from the coffee and sprint back through the doors. \u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Dan says, his own cowardice feeling vaguely nauseating as it curdles in his stomach. \u201cShe mentioned.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYesterday, when I used the phone at reception-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I\u2019ve been keeping you awake,\u201d Dan blurts, badly needing this to be over <i>now</i>. \u201cI never meant to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d Mr Novokoric says, which stuns Dan into silence. For a minute, all he can do is stare into those two darting blue eyes, utterly perplexed. Mr Novokoric sips his coffee self-consciously. \u201cIt was rude and completely unacceptable for me to hone in on something so personal. I have no idea what your circumstances might be. I was upset, and I lashed out. So,\u201d he sticks his hand out, awkwardly, into the space between them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Can we put it behind us?\u201d </p><p>Dan stares at his outstretched hand as if it were a foreign beast. Then, belatedly remembering societal norms, he reaches out and takes it. \u201cW-well, I suppose-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Mr Novokoric says, shaking Dan\u2019s hand quickly, once, up and down, and then dropping it like it\u2019s coated in poison.\u00a0</p><p>Dan stares at Mr Novokoric\u2019s back as he sets the coffee down and pulls his gloves back on. Could it be that there\u2019s a shade of decency to this man? Not once did it cross Dan\u2019s mind that the reason he might be looking for Dan was to <i>apologise</i>. </p><p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Dan echoes softly, and Mr Novokoric turns, eyebrows raised, as if he\u2019s surprised Dan is still standing there. </p><p>\u201cYou can go now,\u201d he says, puzzled, and turns his back. </p><p>All thoughts that Mr Novokoric is anything less than a rude, entitled bitch flies out of the gym window. Dan rolls his eyes, shaking his sleeve dry as he turns to leave. </p><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">(Chapter Four!)</a></b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17623067/chapters/41549267\">Ao3 Link</a></p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Chapter Three</b><br></p><p>Mr Novokoric doesn\u2019t cross paths with Dan for the rest of the day, so Dan doesn\u2019t get a second opportunity to gawp at an entitled semi-celebrity, not that he has much of a desire to, after their first encounter. It\u2019s probably for the best that Dan avoids him for a while, given that he\u2019s still shimmering with rage. How was he supposed to know that this man is some sort of Royal exception to the hotel rules? Just because he made a mistake doesn\u2019t mean he deserved to be talked to with such\u2026 <i>disdain</i>.\u00a0</p><p>So, devoid of any further unpleasant - albeit unnervingly handsome - strangers, the rest of Dan\u2019s third day passes without much to note. Mona had been right about the days here being pretty much the same. He imagines it will soon become hard to distinguish one day from the next. He\u2019ll have to use the evening film as a marker so he can remember which days he did what, though that won\u2019t be easy either, as Mona has an apparent love for heist movies, which aren\u2019t known for their vastly dissimilar plots.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan heads to bed weary, wondering how long it will take to fall into a routine, so he can drift through the days without thinking. As he fumbles for his key, he notes the light on in the next room again, and pauses. <i>He spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.</i> If Mr Novo-dick is really in the room next to his, then that presumably means the music Dan has been hearing is coming from him. At least that means Dan isn\u2019t developing a slow schizophrenia, but it does seem odd. Dan wouldn\u2019t have had the man who shouted at him this morning pegged as a Chopin enthusiast. </p><p>Putting it to the back of his mind for now, Dan goes inside and gets ready for bed, only realising he\u2019s being especially quiet when he\u2019s already in his pyjamas, sat under the covers, ears staining to hear something above the silence. As the wait stretches on, Dan feels the familiar weight of his own guilt, failure and misery closing in, and soon the first of his tears begin to drip from his lashes. Soon, he is full on sniffling, eyes streaming, mouth pulled down in an unattractive curl. </p><p>And like clockwork, a melody begins, drifting slowly and calmly through the wooden wall. It\u2019s soothing and delicate, making Dan\u2019s sniffs lessen, and then stop altogether. He sighs in relief, settling back into his pillows, and lets the music buffet him gently into a long, deep sleep.</p><p>*</p><p>The next couple of days pass in a similar vein. Dan is woken early by the extreme light pouring into his room. He drags himself downstairs and into the kitchen, where Louise teases him for ten minutes straight while he drinks the coffee she makes him, and eats whatever delicious food she\u2019s prepared. He sets up for breakfast out on the balcony with Mona, and serves the four guests that attend, all of whom tell him he\u2019s a \u2018charming\u2019 and \u2018polite\u2019 young man.\u00a0</p><p>In the intervening hours between breakfast and lunch, he cleans the guests\u2019 bedrooms and changes the beds, tidies the communal areas, and if he\u2019s feeling brave, goes outside to sweep the area around the hot tub and wipe down the benches in the sauna. He and Mona then serve lunch, eat whatever Louise has left over, then do a general stock take. After that, they serve dinner, eat dinner, and finally set up the evening film. During any downtime, Dan sits at the front desk, answering the phone when it occasionally rings, booking in new guests, or granting the requests of current ones. At the end of the long days, Dan falls onto his bed, sometimes managing to worm out of his clothes, sometimes not, and makes a valiant attempt at crying himself to sleep. Inevitably however, that light, classical music starts up before he can get too lost in his own sadness, and he finds himself floating away with it, his cheeks sticky with dried tears when he wakes up the next morning, ready to repeat the whole thing again. </p><p>He\u2019s never exactly rushed off his feet, but he rarely has time to be bored, apart from late in the evening, when Mona leaves him at the desk, and he wiles away the hours until his shift ends playing on his phone, or reading one of the books left for guests on the mezzanine lounge. </p><p>For three days, Dan doesn\u2019t speak again with Mr Novokoric, though he does glimpse a flash of crimson from his window each morning, and occasionally catches sight of him wandering through the hotel, on his way back from the hot tub, or clasping a cup of coffee as he sneaks back into his room. On his fifth day, Dan watched from the desk as Mr Stevens - a middle aged guest with a receding hairline and an aversion to wearing anything except a robe - accost Mr Novokoric in the lobby to discuss the weather. Somewhat hilariously, Mr Novokoric appeared to be too polite to simply turn his back on the man, and had stood for eight patient minutes, responding in short, stunted sentences, and looking extremely uncomfortable. It had been the highlight of Dan\u2019s day. </p><p>On Saturday, Dan\u2019s seventh day, just before noon, Dan is sat at the front desk, wondering if Louise might have finished making lunch yet, and if he could go up and see, when the front door slams open, and Mr Novokoric hurtles through it, still wearing his skis. Dan can only watch, mouth agape, as the man awkwardly but determinedly slides his way into the lobby before reaching down, muttering angrily, and undoing the skis one at a time. He then proceeds to kick each one hard, sending them skittering across the wooden floor, and into the far wall. It\u2019s reckless, idiotic behaviour, and if it had been anyone else, Dan would not have hesitated to call them out on it. The skis are heavy, and the walls are made of wood, for christ\u2019s sake. Dan can see the chips they\u2019ve made from all the way across the room. </p><p>Mr Novokoric does not, apparently, care about this. He marches across the room towards Dan, pulling off his thick gloves and tossing them to the floor as he goes. If he thinks Dan is picking them up for him he can forget about it. By the time Mr Novokoric is at the desk, Dan\u2019s mouth is a set line, and he\u2019s having trouble keeping himself from curling his fingers into fists. </p><p>\u201cSir, is there something the matter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to use your phone,\u201d Mr Novokoric barks. \u201cNow.\u201d </p><p>Dan thinks about saying no, or refusing, mostly because he wants to piss this asshole off, but his years of customer service training override his petulance. \u201cCertainly, Sir,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, then reaches underneath the desk, and lifts the corded telephone up onto it. \u201cGo right ahead.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric snatches the receiver at once, and immediately begins punching in numbers with such vigorous jabbing motions that Dan fears for the keys. He lifts the receiver to his ear, fingers drumming restlessly on the lip of the desk. He turns to Dan, incredulous. </p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there and listen to my private call?\u201d </p><p>Heat surges into Dan\u2019s cheeks, mostly born of the intense anger that sweeps through him. He doesn\u2019t trust himself to reply, so he simply turns from the sight of the man in front of him, and begins pretending to be engrossed in the guest information database on the hotel\u2019s only ancient computer. </p><p>For a moment, Dan can still feel eyes on him, and is convinced he\u2019s about to be shouted at further, but then he hears Mr Novokoric\u2019s voice say \u201cabout bloody time!\u201d </p><p>The voice on the other end of the line, which Dan can just about hear, replies, \u201cwho is this?\u201d </p><p>Dan has to hide his smirk in his hand. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your husband, you wank-stain,\u201d comes Mr Novokoric\u2019s hushed, furious response, which has Dan\u2019s eyebrows shooting up his forehead. \u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised you don\u2019t recognise my voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d the disembodied voice says, vaguely. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the number you were calling from a minute ago.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s taking an extreme amount of effort for Dan to keep his eyes fixed on the screen in front of him. He tries valiantly to appear as though he\u2019s engrossed in reading the Stevens\u2019 guest information. It seems that under \u2018special requests\u2019, Mr and Mrs Stevens had asked for \u2018an extra robe each\u2019. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you pissed me off so much that I dropped my phone down a mountain!\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause in the conversation, and then the responding voice says, a touch amusedly, \u201ca little harsh to blame me for that, darling. What could I possibly have said that would upset you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset because you cancelled on me, <i>again</i>!\u201d Mr Novokoric snaps. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Nikolai. How long are you going to leave me up here at the peak of Mount-fucking-Whatever? Are you playing out some warped, Rapunzel love story for the media?\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s something vaguely pathetic lurking beneath Mr Novokoric\u2019s words. Dan squints at the screen, not seeing it, and strains to hear whatever is being said on the other end of the line. </p><p>\u201cDarling, you know I\u2019d have you with me in a heartbeat if I could,\u201d the voice says, sounding slow and distracted. \u201cI\u2019ve just been drowning in all these meetings and dull media-stints. You\u2019d be bored stiff if you were here. It won\u2019t be much longer. There\u2019s that benefit thingy in a week or so, right? You should probably come along to that. I\u2019ll send the helicopter to collect you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh I should <i>probably</i> come, should I?\u201d Mr Novokoric snarls. \u201cGood to know that, as we\u2019re married, it\u2019s <i>probably</i> a good idea for us to be together at least one fucking night of the year. You know, most married couples actually live in the same house. We\u2019re not even in the same country most of the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best that you stay out of the public eye for a bit, Phil. We\u2019ve spoken about this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, Nik, you said you\u2019d take a few days off to spend some time with me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI have to go, darling, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the voice says. Dan might be imagining it, but he thinks he hears a splashing noise, followed by a shriek of laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a week.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise? Nikolai, are you in the Ibiza apartment again-\u201d</p><p>He cuts off as the dull note of the dial tone replaces the other person\u2019s voice. Dan chews the inside of his cheek, and sneaks a glance up as Mr Novokoric places the receiver down, slowly, and turns to lean against the desk. At first, Dan is smug; he wishes he were able to hang up so brutally on him, but on closer inspection, he notices that Mr Novokoric actually appears to be crying. At least, his bright blue eyes are glistening. Traitorously, Dan\u2019s good nature wins out, and he feels his heart squeeze in dumb sympathy. Dick-brain or not, Dan can\u2019t just sit by while a guest he\u2019s employed to look after cries right beside him. He plucks the box of tissues from the shelf behind him. </p><p>\u201cEx-excuse me, Mr Novokoric,\u201d Dan says, swallowing a wash of pride for getting the name right on his first out-loud try. He holds out the box of tissues even though the other man doesn\u2019t acknowledge him. \u201cHere, take these.\u201d </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns to Dan coldly, snatching the box from him. \u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d he insists, but yanks a tissue from the box anyway, scrubbing it over his face. </p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Dan says, nodding in complete agreement with this outright lie. He really is an absurdly patient and talented customer service worker. \u201cI just thought\u2026\u201d he scrambles for a viable explanation. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you but I think the, er, high altitude of this place does something weird to my sinuses. I\u2019m blubbering every night,\u201d he jokes, thinking that the peppering of truth might give his ramble a little weight.\u00a0</p><p>It would be so easy, Dan thinks, for Mr Novokoric to accept Dan\u2019s fumbling excuse for the offer of tissues, to blame the thin air for his tears and never speak about it again. But evidently the man has a defensive arsenal so loaded and precarious it can be triggered with the slightest wrong step. </p><p>So, Mr Novokoric\u2019s expression hardens, and he says, \u201cso it\u2019s you that I can hear wailing on the other side of my wall, is it? You should keep these for yourself.\u201d He shoves the tissues back into Dan\u2019s hands. \u201cMaybe then I\u2019ll actually get some sleep.\u201d </p><p>Like he\u2019s been whipped, Dan shrinks back, attempting to swallow the burning lump of coal now lodged in his throat. Any response he might have had, stupidly kind or not, dies on his tongue. For a split second, he imagines he sees a flash of regret pass over Mr Novokoric\u2019s features, but then he is stalking away, skis lying forgotten against the wall, and stomping up the stairs. Dan sits heavily down in his chair, and tries not to let the flames of angry, hurt humiliation burn him to ash. </p><p>*</p><p>That night, Dan does his best to muffle his sobs in his pillow. They\u2019re worse tonight, because the embarrassment of knowing he\u2019s being heard, that he\u2019s been heard this whole time, only makes him feel worse. If he could halt the tears altogether for Mr Novokoric\u2019s sake he would, but nightfall has always been the time where his resolve leaves him. With nothing to distract him, Dan can only dwell on everything that\u2019s wrong. At ten past one, however, the music seems to know to start up anyway; it\u2019s baffling, obviously, but the only explanation Dan can think of is that the music is either unrelated to Dan\u2019s crying, or being played to drown it out. He tries not to be grateful for it, knows that before long he\u2019ll rely on it to send him off, but in the end he can\u2019t help letting the swells of notes wash over him, and press him into unconsciousness. </p><p>*</p><p>Just after lunch has been cleared on Sunday, Dan is caught in a pleasant but rather over-detailed discussion with Mr and Mrs Stevens about their show-dog, Sherbet, when Louise calls him over from the serving hatch. He excuses himself politely, leaving the middle-aged couple to their game of Uno, and walks up to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you today?\u201d she asks as soon as he\u2019s within earshot, then places a mug of coffee in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a face like a trodden foot.\u201d </p><p>He manages a smile, but he doubts it\u2019s very convincing. \u201cJust tired,\u201d he says, picking up the mug. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She slaps his wrist, and he almost spills some. \u201cThat\u2019s not for you, foot-face.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He lowers it, glancing back at the Stevens\u2019s. \u201cDid they order\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Phil,\u201d she says, briskly wiping up the coffee Dan spilled with a wad of kitchen roll. For a moment, Dan just looks at her blankly, and she raises an eyebrow. \u201cMr Novokoric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, and smartly places the mug back down, stomach squeezing. </p><p>For whatever reason, his abrupt action makes Louise laugh. \u201cChrist, he\u2019s not a yeti, Dan. Anyway, he\u2019s been looking for you all morning, so I thought you could take this to him.\u201d </p><p>Exhausted as he is, it takes the words a few tries to penetrate Dan\u2019s addled mind. \u201cWait, what?\u201d he asks eventually, sure he must have misheard. \u201cLooking for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Louise replies, like this is a perfectly normal occurence. \u201cMona mentioned it earlier. Apparently he was hoping to catch you at breakfast but you weren\u2019t serving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I was adjusting the chlorine levels in the hot tub,\u201d Dan says, feeling as though he\u2019s stood on the edge of a crumbling cliff. Mr Novokoric is looking for him, specifically? Had he not made Dan feel awful enough yesterday? Is he looking for another chance to brutally attack his ego for a trivial reason? \u201cDo I have to take this to him?\u201d</p><p>Louise looks at him strangely. \u201cAre you scared of him or something? I know he\u2019s technically Royalty, but he\u2019s just a regular guy underneath, Dan. Not much older than you. I know it\u2019s a bit daunting at first, but don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s pretty chill.\u201d</p><p>This makes Dan snort. \u201cI\u2019ll try and remember that next time he\u2019s verbally abusing me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a hot-head at times,\u201d Louise allows. \u201cI remember my first few encounters with him being on the snippy side. You\u2019ve just got to get past that though, he doesn\u2019t mean it. I just think he\u2019s a bit\u2026 frustrated.\u201d This makes Dan\u2019s eyebrows shoot up his forehead, and Louise laughs at her own phrasing. \u201cNot like that. Well, maybe like that. I mean, he\u2019s here for weeks at a time, supposedly having ensnared this fabulous young hottie. But where is this prize pig, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIbiza,\u201d Dan mutters, and when Louise sends him a puzzled look, he picks up the coffee mug, sensing defeat. \u201cWhere am I taking this, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe was heading for the gym, last I saw.\u201d Louise watches him make his way towards the stairs, being extra careful not to spill any coffee lest he feel the wrath upon its delivery. \u201cDan?\u201d she calls out, making him pause. \u201cBe nice, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i> be nice?\u201d Dan exclaims, and turns to shoot her an incredulous look, but Louise\u2019s expression is unmoved.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust let him say what he\u2019s got to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him belittle me, you mean?\u201d </p><p>Louise sighs heavily, turning away from him, and Dan is left in the middle of the mezzanine with a steaming mug of coffee, and a niggling sense that there\u2019s still some great secret etched into the wooden walls of this place that he still hasn\u2019t been entirely privy to. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan has only been in the gym once, on his first day, which is a perfect allegory for his entire mentality around gyms in general. From outside the door, he can hear a rhythmic pounding noise, like someone is punching the shit out of something. It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that as he enters the gym, he sees Mr Novokoric in the corner by the mirrors, punching the shit out of a big cylindrical bag. For obvious reasons, this sight does not instil Dan with a desperate urge to go over and interact with Mr Novokoric, who is wearing headphones, and appears not to have noticed Dan come in. </p><p>Giving him a wide berth, Dan slowly approaches, intending to place the mug of coffee down on a nearby surface and escape quickly before Mr Novokoric has the chance to either hit him or yell at him some more. Instead, what happens is this: Dan attempts to edge along the wall to put the coffee down, and at the same moment, Mr Novokoric draws back his elbow and catches Dan in the arm, jolting him. Louise makes a good cup of coffee, Dan will admit. As it soaks through the fabric of his shirt sleeve, however, he can\u2019t help but wish it was a little less scalding. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dan shouts, just as Mr Novokoric jumps back in surprise, ripping his headphones from his ears. He\u2019s panting and damp, strands of his jet black hair sticking to his forehead, making it look like he\u2019s got a stupid noughties side-fringe. </p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Mr Novokoric exclaims, as if Dan hasn\u2019t already done the stupid thing. Surprisingly, he takes the mug of hot coffee from Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d </p><p>Dan shakes out his sleeve, wincing. \u201cI\u2019ll live. Sorry for startling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should announce yourself next time,\u201d he says, like a wanker. Like Dan calling out\u00a0\u2018whaddup it\u2019s me your boy Dan\u2019 would have done any good at all when he was blaring what Dan thinks is\u2026 Fall Out Boy? Really?\u2026 through his headphones. \u201cI could have really hurt you.\u201d </p><p>Doubtful of this statement, Dan\u2019s eyes flick down to Mr Novokoric\u2019s biceps. Begrudgingly, as he surveys the shallow valleys of his arm muscles, Dan admits to himself that out of the two of them, there\u2019s no question of who would best the other. Dan\u2019s never been more glad of his own long sleeves.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan mutters, wanting nothing more than to scurry away to his room and recover from this incident with the excuse of changing his wet shirt. \u201cSorry, Sir. Won\u2019t happen again. Enjoy your coffee.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says as Dan turns to go. \u201cI wanted to speak with you.\u201d </p><p>Oh, God. It\u2019s true. Louise wasn\u2019t pulling his leg, it seems. Dan seriously considers just legging it. He could potentially feign a third degree burn from the coffee and sprint back through the doors. \u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Dan says, his own cowardice feeling vaguely nauseating as it curdles in his stomach. \u201cShe mentioned.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYesterday, when I used the phone at reception-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that I\u2019ve been keeping you awake,\u201d Dan blurts, badly needing this to be over <i>now</i>. \u201cI never meant to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d Mr Novokoric says, which stuns Dan into silence. For a minute, all he can do is stare into those two darting blue eyes, utterly perplexed. Mr Novokoric sips his coffee self-consciously. \u201cIt was rude and completely unacceptable for me to hone in on something so personal. I have no idea what your circumstances might be. I was upset, and I lashed out. So,\u201d he sticks his hand out, awkwardly, into the space between them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Can we put it behind us?\u201d </p><p>Dan stares at his outstretched hand as if it were a foreign beast. Then, belatedly remembering societal norms, he reaches out and takes it. \u201cW-well, I suppose-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Mr Novokoric says, shaking Dan\u2019s hand quickly, once, up and down, and then dropping it like it\u2019s coated in poison.\u00a0</p><p>Dan stares at Mr Novokoric\u2019s back as he sets the coffee down and pulls his gloves back on. Could it be that there\u2019s a shade of decency to this man? Not once did it cross Dan\u2019s mind that the reason he might be looking for Dan was to <i>apologise</i>. </p><p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Dan echoes softly, and Mr Novokoric turns, eyebrows raised, as if he\u2019s surprised Dan is still standing there. </p><p>\u201cYou can go now,\u201d he says, puzzled, and turns his back. </p><p>All thoughts that Mr Novokoric is anything less than a rude, entitled bitch flies out of the gym window. Dan rolls his eyes, shaking his sleeve dry as he turns to leave. </p><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">(Chapter Four!)</a></b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17623067/chapters/41549267\">Ao3 Link</a></p><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Chapter Three</b><br /></p><p>Mr Novokoric doesn&rsquo;t cross paths with Dan for the rest of the day, so Dan doesn&rsquo;t get a second opportunity to gawp at an entitled semi-celebrity, not that he has much of a desire to, after their first encounter. It&rsquo;s probably for the best that Dan avoids him for a while, given that he&rsquo;s still shimmering with rage. How was he supposed to know that this man is some sort of Royal exception to the hotel rules? Just because he made a mistake doesn&rsquo;t mean he deserved to be talked to with such&hellip; <i>disdain</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, devoid of any further unpleasant - albeit unnervingly handsome - strangers, the rest of Dan&rsquo;s third day passes without much to note. Mona had been right about the days here being pretty much the same. He imagines it will soon become hard to distinguish one day from the next. He&rsquo;ll have to use the evening film as a marker so he can remember which days he did what, though that won&rsquo;t be easy either, as Mona has an apparent love for heist movies, which aren&rsquo;t known for their vastly dissimilar plots.<br /></p><p>Dan heads to bed weary, wondering how long it will take to fall into a routine, so he can drift through the days without thinking. As he fumbles for his key, he notes the light on in the next room again, and pauses. <i>He spends most of his days alone here, either in the suite on the top floor, or out on the slopes somewhere.</i> If Mr Novo-dick is really in the room next to his, then that presumably means the music Dan has been hearing is coming from him. At least that means Dan isn&rsquo;t developing a slow schizophrenia, but it does seem odd. Dan wouldn&rsquo;t have had the man who shouted at him this morning pegged as a Chopin enthusiast. </p><p>Putting it to the back of his mind for now, Dan goes inside and gets ready for bed, only realising he&rsquo;s being especially quiet when he&rsquo;s already in his pyjamas, sat under the covers, ears staining to hear something above the silence. As the wait stretches on, Dan feels the familiar weight of his own guilt, failure and misery closing in, and soon the first of his tears begin to drip from his lashes. Soon, he is full on sniffling, eyes streaming, mouth pulled down in an unattractive curl. </p><p>And like clockwork, a melody begins, drifting slowly and calmly through the wooden wall. It&rsquo;s soothing and delicate, making Dan&rsquo;s sniffs lessen, and then stop altogether. He sighs in relief, settling back into his pillows, and lets the music buffet him gently into a long, deep sleep.</p><p>*</p><p>The next couple of days pass in a similar vein. Dan is woken early by the extreme light pouring into his room. He drags himself downstairs and into the kitchen, where Louise teases him for ten minutes straight while he drinks the coffee she makes him, and eats whatever delicious food she&rsquo;s prepared. He sets up for breakfast out on the balcony with Mona, and serves the four guests that attend, all of whom tell him he&rsquo;s a &lsquo;charming&rsquo; and &lsquo;polite&rsquo; young man.&nbsp;</p><p>In the intervening hours between breakfast and lunch, he cleans the guests&rsquo; bedrooms and changes the beds, tidies the communal areas, and if he&rsquo;s feeling brave, goes outside to sweep the area around the hot tub and wipe down the benches in the sauna. He and Mona then serve lunch, eat whatever Louise has left over, then do a general stock take. After that, they serve dinner, eat dinner, and finally set up the evening film. During any downtime, Dan sits at the front desk, answering the phone when it occasionally rings, booking in new guests, or granting the requests of current ones. At the end of the long days, Dan falls onto his bed, sometimes managing to worm out of his clothes, sometimes not, and makes a valiant attempt at crying himself to sleep. Inevitably however, that light, classical music starts up before he can get too lost in his own sadness, and he finds himself floating away with it, his cheeks sticky with dried tears when he wakes up the next morning, ready to repeat the whole thing again. </p><p>He&rsquo;s never exactly rushed off his feet, but he rarely has time to be bored, apart from late in the evening, when Mona leaves him at the desk, and he wiles away the hours until his shift ends playing on his phone, or reading one of the books left for guests on the mezzanine lounge. </p><p>For three days, Dan doesn&rsquo;t speak again with Mr Novokoric, though he does glimpse a flash of crimson from his window each morning, and occasionally catches sight of him wandering through the hotel, on his way back from the hot tub, or clasping a cup of coffee as he sneaks back into his room. On his fifth day, Dan watched from the desk as Mr Stevens - a middle aged guest with a receding hairline and an aversion to wearing anything except a robe - accost Mr Novokoric in the lobby to discuss the weather. Somewhat hilariously, Mr Novokoric appeared to be too polite to simply turn his back on the man, and had stood for eight patient minutes, responding in short, stunted sentences, and looking extremely uncomfortable. It had been the highlight of Dan&rsquo;s day. </p><p>On Saturday, Dan&rsquo;s seventh day, just before noon, Dan is sat at the front desk, wondering if Louise might have finished making lunch yet, and if he could go up and see, when the front door slams open, and Mr Novokoric hurtles through it, still wearing his skis. Dan can only watch, mouth agape, as the man awkwardly but determinedly slides his way into the lobby before reaching down, muttering angrily, and undoing the skis one at a time. He then proceeds to kick each one hard, sending them skittering across the wooden floor, and into the far wall. It&rsquo;s reckless, idiotic behaviour, and if it had been anyone else, Dan would not have hesitated to call them out on it. The skis are heavy, and the walls are made of wood, for christ&rsquo;s sake. Dan can see the chips they&rsquo;ve made from all the way across the room. </p><p>Mr Novokoric does not, apparently, care about this. He marches across the room towards Dan, pulling off his thick gloves and tossing them to the floor as he goes. If he thinks Dan is picking them up for him he can forget about it. By the time Mr Novokoric is at the desk, Dan&rsquo;s mouth is a set line, and he&rsquo;s having trouble keeping himself from curling his fingers into fists. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, is there something the matter-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to use your phone,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric barks. &ldquo;Now.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan thinks about saying no, or refusing, mostly because he wants to piss this asshole off, but his years of customer service training override his petulance. &ldquo;Certainly, Sir,&rdquo; he says through gritted teeth, then reaches underneath the desk, and lifts the corded telephone up onto it. &ldquo;Go right ahead.&rdquo; </p><p>Mr Novokoric snatches the receiver at once, and immediately begins punching in numbers with such vigorous jabbing motions that Dan fears for the keys. He lifts the receiver to his ear, fingers drumming restlessly on the lip of the desk. He turns to Dan, incredulous. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you just going to stand there and listen to my private call?&rdquo; </p><p>Heat surges into Dan&rsquo;s cheeks, mostly born of the intense anger that sweeps through him. He doesn&rsquo;t trust himself to reply, so he simply turns from the sight of the man in front of him, and begins pretending to be engrossed in the guest information database on the hotel&rsquo;s only ancient computer. </p><p>For a moment, Dan can still feel eyes on him, and is convinced he&rsquo;s about to be shouted at further, but then he hears Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s voice say &ldquo;about bloody time!&rdquo; </p><p>The voice on the other end of the line, which Dan can just about hear, replies, &ldquo;who is this?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan has to hide his smirk in his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your husband, you wank-stain,&rdquo; comes Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s hushed, furious response, which has Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows shooting up his forehead. &ldquo;I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised you don&rsquo;t recognise my voice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo; the disembodied voice says, vaguely. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the number you were calling from a minute ago.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s taking an extreme amount of effort for Dan to keep his eyes fixed on the screen in front of him. He tries valiantly to appear as though he&rsquo;s engrossed in reading the Stevens&rsquo; guest information. It seems that under &lsquo;special requests&rsquo;, Mr and Mrs Stevens had asked for &lsquo;an extra robe each&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you pissed me off so much that I dropped my phone down a mountain!&rdquo; </p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause in the conversation, and then the responding voice says, a touch amusedly, &ldquo;a little harsh to blame me for that, darling. What could I possibly have said that would upset you so much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m upset because you cancelled on me, <i>again</i>!&rdquo; Mr Novokoric snaps. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you, Nikolai. How long are you going to leave me up here at the peak of Mount-fucking-Whatever? Are you playing out some warped, Rapunzel love story for the media?&rdquo; </p><p>There&rsquo;s something vaguely pathetic lurking beneath Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s words. Dan squints at the screen, not seeing it, and strains to hear whatever is being said on the other end of the line. </p><p>&ldquo;Darling, you know I&rsquo;d have you with me in a heartbeat if I could,&rdquo; the voice says, sounding slow and distracted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been drowning in all these meetings and dull media-stints. You&rsquo;d be bored stiff if you were here. It won&rsquo;t be much longer. There&rsquo;s that benefit thingy in a week or so, right? You should probably come along to that. I&rsquo;ll send the helicopter to collect you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh I should <i>probably</i> come, should I?&rdquo; Mr Novokoric snarls. &ldquo;Good to know that, as we&rsquo;re married, it&rsquo;s <i>probably</i> a good idea for us to be together at least one fucking night of the year. You know, most married couples actually live in the same house. We&rsquo;re not even in the same country most of the time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the best that you stay out of the public eye for a bit, Phil. We&rsquo;ve spoken about this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if that&rsquo;s true, Nik, you said you&rsquo;d take a few days off to spend some time with me-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have to go, darling, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the voice says. Dan might be imagining it, but he thinks he hears a splashing noise, followed by a shriek of laughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in a week.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that noise? Nikolai, are you in the Ibiza apartment again-&rdquo;</p><p>He cuts off as the dull note of the dial tone replaces the other person&rsquo;s voice. Dan chews the inside of his cheek, and sneaks a glance up as Mr Novokoric places the receiver down, slowly, and turns to lean against the desk. At first, Dan is smug; he wishes he were able to hang up so brutally on him, but on closer inspection, he notices that Mr Novokoric actually appears to be crying. At least, his bright blue eyes are glistening. Traitorously, Dan&rsquo;s good nature wins out, and he feels his heart squeeze in dumb sympathy. Dick-brain or not, Dan can&rsquo;t just sit by while a guest he&rsquo;s employed to look after cries right beside him. He plucks the box of tissues from the shelf behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Ex-excuse me, Mr Novokoric,&rdquo; Dan says, swallowing a wash of pride for getting the name right on his first out-loud try. He holds out the box of tissues even though the other man doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge him. &ldquo;Here, take these.&rdquo; </p><p>Mr Novokoric turns to Dan coldly, snatching the box from him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying,&rdquo; he insists, but yanks a tissue from the box anyway, scrubbing it over his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Dan says, nodding in complete agreement with this outright lie. He really is an absurdly patient and talented customer service worker. &ldquo;I just thought&hellip;&rdquo; he scrambles for a viable explanation. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about you but I think the, er, high altitude of this place does something weird to my sinuses. I&rsquo;m blubbering every night,&rdquo; he jokes, thinking that the peppering of truth might give his ramble a little weight.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be so easy, Dan thinks, for Mr Novokoric to accept Dan&rsquo;s fumbling excuse for the offer of tissues, to blame the thin air for his tears and never speak about it again. But evidently the man has a defensive arsenal so loaded and precarious it can be triggered with the slightest wrong step. </p><p>So, Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s expression hardens, and he says, &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s you that I can hear wailing on the other side of my wall, is it? You should keep these for yourself.&rdquo; He shoves the tissues back into Dan&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Maybe then I&rsquo;ll actually get some sleep.&rdquo; </p><p>Like he&rsquo;s been whipped, Dan shrinks back, attempting to swallow the burning lump of coal now lodged in his throat. Any response he might have had, stupidly kind or not, dies on his tongue. For a split second, he imagines he sees a flash of regret pass over Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s features, but then he is stalking away, skis lying forgotten against the wall, and stomping up the stairs. Dan sits heavily down in his chair, and tries not to let the flames of angry, hurt humiliation burn him to ash. </p><p>*</p><p>That night, Dan does his best to muffle his sobs in his pillow. They&rsquo;re worse tonight, because the embarrassment of knowing he&rsquo;s being heard, that he&rsquo;s been heard this whole time, only makes him feel worse. If he could halt the tears altogether for Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s sake he would, but nightfall has always been the time where his resolve leaves him. With nothing to distract him, Dan can only dwell on everything that&rsquo;s wrong. At ten past one, however, the music seems to know to start up anyway; it&rsquo;s baffling, obviously, but the only explanation Dan can think of is that the music is either unrelated to Dan&rsquo;s crying, or being played to drown it out. He tries not to be grateful for it, knows that before long he&rsquo;ll rely on it to send him off, but in the end he can&rsquo;t help letting the swells of notes wash over him, and press him into unconsciousness. </p><p>*</p><p>Just after lunch has been cleared on Sunday, Dan is caught in a pleasant but rather over-detailed discussion with Mr and Mrs Stevens about their show-dog, Sherbet, when Louise calls him over from the serving hatch. He excuses himself politely, leaving the middle-aged couple to their game of Uno, and walks up to her.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you today?&rdquo; she asks as soon as he&rsquo;s within earshot, then places a mug of coffee in front of him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a face like a trodden foot.&rdquo; </p><p>He manages a smile, but he doubts it&rsquo;s very convincing. &ldquo;Just tired,&rdquo; he says, picking up the mug. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>She slaps his wrist, and he almost spills some. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for you, foot-face.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; He lowers it, glancing back at the Stevens&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Did they order&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Phil,&rdquo; she says, briskly wiping up the coffee Dan spilled with a wad of kitchen roll. For a moment, Dan just looks at her blankly, and she raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;Mr Novokoric.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, and smartly places the mug back down, stomach squeezing. </p><p>For whatever reason, his abrupt action makes Louise laugh. &ldquo;Christ, he&rsquo;s not a yeti, Dan. Anyway, he&rsquo;s been looking for you all morning, so I thought you could take this to him.&rdquo; </p><p>Exhausted as he is, it takes the words a few tries to penetrate Dan&rsquo;s addled mind. &ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; he asks eventually, sure he must have misheard. &ldquo;Looking for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Louise replies, like this is a perfectly normal occurence. &ldquo;Mona mentioned it earlier. Apparently he was hoping to catch you at breakfast but you weren&rsquo;t serving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I was adjusting the chlorine levels in the hot tub,&rdquo; Dan says, feeling as though he&rsquo;s stood on the edge of a crumbling cliff. Mr Novokoric is looking for him, specifically? Had he not made Dan feel awful enough yesterday? Is he looking for another chance to brutally attack his ego for a trivial reason? &ldquo;Do I have to take this to him?&rdquo;</p><p>Louise looks at him strangely. &ldquo;Are you scared of him or something? I know he&rsquo;s technically Royalty, but he&rsquo;s just a regular guy underneath, Dan. Not much older than you. I know it&rsquo;s a bit daunting at first, but don&rsquo;t worry. He&rsquo;s pretty chill.&rdquo;</p><p>This makes Dan snort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and remember that next time he&rsquo;s verbally abusing me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s a hot-head at times,&rdquo; Louise allows. &ldquo;I remember my first few encounters with him being on the snippy side. You&rsquo;ve just got to get past that though, he doesn&rsquo;t mean it. I just think he&rsquo;s a bit&hellip; frustrated.&rdquo; This makes Dan&rsquo;s eyebrows shoot up his forehead, and Louise laughs at her own phrasing. &ldquo;Not like that. Well, maybe like that. I mean, he&rsquo;s here for weeks at a time, supposedly having ensnared this fabulous young hottie. But where is this prize pig, y&rsquo;know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ibiza,&rdquo; Dan mutters, and when Louise sends him a puzzled look, he picks up the coffee mug, sensing defeat. &ldquo;Where am I taking this, then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He was heading for the gym, last I saw.&rdquo; Louise watches him make his way towards the stairs, being extra careful not to spill any coffee lest he feel the wrath upon its delivery. &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; she calls out, making him pause. &ldquo;Be nice, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Me</i> be nice?&rdquo; Dan exclaims, and turns to shoot her an incredulous look, but Louise&rsquo;s expression is unmoved.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just let him say what he&rsquo;s got to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let him belittle me, you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>Louise sighs heavily, turning away from him, and Dan is left in the middle of the mezzanine with a steaming mug of coffee, and a niggling sense that there&rsquo;s still some great secret etched into the wooden walls of this place that he still hasn&rsquo;t been entirely privy to. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan has only been in the gym once, on his first day, which is a perfect allegory for his entire mentality around gyms in general. From outside the door, he can hear a rhythmic pounding noise, like someone is punching the shit out of something. It&rsquo;s unsurprising, then, that as he enters the gym, he sees Mr Novokoric in the corner by the mirrors, punching the shit out of a big cylindrical bag. For obvious reasons, this sight does not instil Dan with a desperate urge to go over and interact with Mr Novokoric, who is wearing headphones, and appears not to have noticed Dan come in. </p><p>Giving him a wide berth, Dan slowly approaches, intending to place the mug of coffee down on a nearby surface and escape quickly before Mr Novokoric has the chance to either hit him or yell at him some more. Instead, what happens is this: Dan attempts to edge along the wall to put the coffee down, and at the same moment, Mr Novokoric draws back his elbow and catches Dan in the arm, jolting him. Louise makes a good cup of coffee, Dan will admit. As it soaks through the fabric of his shirt sleeve, however, he can&rsquo;t help but wish it was a little less scalding. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Dan shouts, just as Mr Novokoric jumps back in surprise, ripping his headphones from his ears. He&rsquo;s panting and damp, strands of his jet black hair sticking to his forehead, making it look like he&rsquo;s got a stupid noughties side-fringe. </p><p>&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; Mr Novokoric exclaims, as if Dan hasn&rsquo;t already done the stupid thing. Surprisingly, he takes the mug of hot coffee from Dan&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shakes out his sleeve, wincing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll live. Sorry for startling you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should announce yourself next time,&rdquo; he says, like a wanker. Like Dan calling out&nbsp;&lsquo;whaddup it&rsquo;s me your boy Dan&rsquo; would have done any good at all when he was blaring what Dan thinks is&hellip; Fall Out Boy? Really?&hellip; through his headphones. &ldquo;I could have really hurt you.&rdquo; </p><p>Doubtful of this statement, Dan&rsquo;s eyes flick down to Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s biceps. Begrudgingly, as he surveys the shallow valleys of his arm muscles, Dan admits to himself that out of the two of them, there&rsquo;s no question of who would best the other. Dan&rsquo;s never been more glad of his own long sleeves.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan mutters, wanting nothing more than to scurry away to his room and recover from this incident with the excuse of changing his wet shirt. &ldquo;Sorry, Sir. Won&rsquo;t happen again. Enjoy your coffee.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he says as Dan turns to go. &ldquo;I wanted to speak with you.&rdquo; </p><p>Oh, God. It&rsquo;s true. Louise wasn&rsquo;t pulling his leg, it seems. Dan seriously considers just legging it. He could potentially feign a third degree burn from the coffee and sprint back through the doors. &ldquo;Um, yeah,&rdquo; Dan says, his own cowardice feeling vaguely nauseating as it curdles in his stomach. &ldquo;She mentioned.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday, when I used the phone at reception-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry that I&rsquo;ve been keeping you awake,&rdquo; Dan blurts, badly needing this to be over <i>now</i>. &ldquo;I never meant to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I owe you an apology,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric says, which stuns Dan into silence. For a minute, all he can do is stare into those two darting blue eyes, utterly perplexed. Mr Novokoric sips his coffee self-consciously. &ldquo;It was rude and completely unacceptable for me to hone in on something so personal. I have no idea what your circumstances might be. I was upset, and I lashed out. So,&rdquo; he sticks his hand out, awkwardly, into the space between them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Can we put it behind us?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan stares at his outstretched hand as if it were a foreign beast. Then, belatedly remembering societal norms, he reaches out and takes it. &ldquo;W-well, I suppose-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Mr Novokoric says, shaking Dan&rsquo;s hand quickly, once, up and down, and then dropping it like it&rsquo;s coated in poison.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan stares at Mr Novokoric&rsquo;s back as he sets the coffee down and pulls his gloves back on. Could it be that there&rsquo;s a shade of decency to this man? Not once did it cross Dan&rsquo;s mind that the reason he might be looking for Dan was to <i>apologise</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, great,&rdquo; Dan echoes softly, and Mr Novokoric turns, eyebrows raised, as if he&rsquo;s surprised Dan is still standing there. </p><p>&ldquo;You can go now,&rdquo; he says, puzzled, and turns his back. </p><p>All thoughts that Mr Novokoric is anything less than a rude, entitled bitch flies out of the gym window. Dan rolls his eyes, shaking his sleeve dry as he turns to leave. </p><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">(Chapter Four!)</a></b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p>\n<p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17623067/chapters/41549267\">Ao3 Link</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a></p>\n<p><b><br /></b></p>\n<p><b>Chapter Three</b><br /></p>\n<p>Mr Novokoric doesn&rsquo;t cross paths with Dan for the rest of the day, so Dan doesn&rsquo;t get a second opportunity to gawp at an entitled semi-celebrity, not that he has much of a desire to, after their first encounter. It&rsquo;s probably for the best that Dan avoids him for a while, given that he&rsquo;s still shimmering with rage. How was he supposed to know that this man is some sort of Royal exception to the hotel rules? Just because he made a mistake doesn&rsquo;t mean he deserved to be talked to with such&hellip; <i>disdain</i>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, devoid of any further unpleasant - albeit unnervingly handsome - strangers, the rest of Dan&rsquo;s third day passes without much to note. Mona had been right about the days here being pretty much the same. He imagines it will soon become hard to distinguish one day from the next. He&rsquo;ll have to use the evening film as a marker so he can remember which days he did what, though that won&rsquo;t be easy either, as Mona has an apparent love for heist movies, which aren&rsquo;t known for their vastly dissimilar plots.<br /></p>\n</p>",
