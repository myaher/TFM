He was a teenager so sometimes he moped but never for more than an hour or two. He was known for being constantly cheerful or even quiet at the very most. But there was one day where he was noticeably different. He wasn\u2019t just quiet. He looked like the physical embodiment of depression.</p><p>May had to go to work as being a nurse didn\u2019t let her have very flexible hours. She wasn\u2019t there to see him and he definitely wasn\u2019t going to call her up because he was a little sad. Instead, he pretended that everything was normal.</p><p>Ned noticed that everything was not normal pretty quickly. He also knew why Peter was sad. So instead of pointing anything out, he distracted Peter with whatever he could and talked to him even if he seemed a little less than willing to talk back. This was still good. Peter needed it.</p><p>But Ned couldn\u2019t spend the whole day with him and eventually, he was alone. This was the one day Peter was not going to Spider-Man the feelings or lack of feelings away. Instead of suiting up after school, he walked to the place that he knew would make him sad. The cemetery.</p><!-- more --><p>It had been one year since Uncle Ben had died and Peter still didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. The plots of land that belonged to Peter\u2019s family were all in a row so that he could see his parents and Bens little gravestones at the same time.</p><p>Despite being a legit superhero, he still felt like he disappointed them somehow. He didn\u2019t know why he just tended to think that way.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ben\u2026 Hi Mom\u2026 Hi dad\u2026\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cracked and he was thankful that the whole cemetery was empty. The cemetery was weirdly peaceful and he couldn\u2019t hear much outside of it. He felt alone. Which wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as he had tears rolling down his face that he had been keeping in all day.</p><p>\u201cI uh\u2026 I miss you\u2026 all of you\u2026 well, mostly Ben but I wouldn\u2019t mind you all coming back.\u201d Peter smiled sadly. \u201cI hope you\u2019d all be proud of me even though I\u2019m constantly doing dumb things\u2026\u201d He sat down on the grass and avoided looking at the engraved name of his uncle as if those were his eyes and he was ashamed.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really visited since you got here so I guess I have a lot to update you on. A lot of things have happened. First off, \u00a0I should confess that I\u2019m kind of a superhero illegal vigilante now. Surprise! And the thing is\u2026 it\u2019s because of you. Because I couldn\u2019t save you. I never wanted anyone else to feel like I did when you left. I never wanted some other kid to call their alive parent to tell them what happened\u2026\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t control the sob that forced itself out of him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t let that happen. No one deserves it. I don\u2019t want anyone else to lose a parent\u2026 or two\u2026 or three.\u201d His voice came out as more of a whisper. \u201cSometimes I forget\u2026 sometimes I forget that you\u2019re gone. And sometimes I can still feel your blood on my hands. I just\u2026 I guess you\u2019re still with me sometimes, even if it\u2019s not as much as I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I came here to say that I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t save you.\u201d Peter stood up after he ran out of things to say. He knew there was no one listening. It was just releasing some of his guilt to the grassy yard full of dead people. Peter was glad that one of his powers wasn\u2019t talking to the dead. That would be awkward.</p><p>He didn\u2019t jump when he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder. His spider-sense didn\u2019t warn him so it must be someone he trusted. Sure enough, he looked up and saw Mr. Stark.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d want to be alone\u2026\u201d Tony said in a more gentle voice than Peter had ever heard. Instead of answering, he just automatically leaned on his mentor. Tony just changed his hand from Peter\u2019s shoulder to around him in a comforting half hug.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Peter sighed as he quickly wiped away a couple of tears that he was embarrassed about having in front of Tony. Instead of being stand-offish like he normally was, Tony just squeezed Peter closer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem kid\u2026 Do you want to continue Hamlet-ing?\u201d Normally the tone of Tony\u2019s voice when he said things like this was much more snarky but this time it just felt like a joke to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2026 I think I\u2019ve said everything that I needed to say\u2026\u201d Peter muttered. He didn\u2019t really didn\u2019t want to talk anymore.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I talk to them?\u201d Tony asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to stop you from monologuing,\u201d Peter admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right about that,\u201d Tony turned towards the graves. \u201cHey uh, Hi Mary, Richard, Ben\u2026 I just wanted to thank you all. I will forever be grateful to you for raising this amazing kid. I have never met someone so kind, so strong, so caring, so\u2026 good than your kid. I know part of that is your fault so I want to thank you for it. It\u2019s my honor to help him and I promise that I won\u2019t let any of you down.\u201d He looked down at Peter when he heard a sniffle.</p><p>\u201cCome on kid\u2026 May was worried about you.\u201d Tony turned them away from the graves and started to slowly meander out of the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d Peter rasped out.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony stopped walking and adjusted Peter so that he was looking straight into the kid&rsquo;s eyes. \u201cSteve Rogers has nothing on you kiddo, you\u2019re going to be the best of us. We need more Peter\u2019s in the world.\u201d Tony wiped a tear from Peter\u2019s cheek with his thumb and gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cThey would be so proud of you, Do you know how I know that? I\u2019ve known you for like eight months and I am so fucking proud of you. Imagine how much they love you huh.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Peter took a moment to internalize that and once he did, he wrapped his arms around Tony with such speed and purpose that he knocked the breath out of him. He hugged back immediately and held the kid in his arms for a few minutes until he was ready to leave.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do anything for you kid. Do you like Italian food? We can order some and watch your nerd show while we wait for your aunt to get back from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you like Star Wars. But, yeah. That sounds great.\u201d Tony wrapped a comforting hand around Peters&rsquo; shoulders as they left the graveyard. Peter felt dramatically better than when he came in. This time he wasn\u2019t alone. And that made all of the difference.\u00a0</p>",

The cemetery.</p>[[MORE]]<p>It had been one year since Uncle Ben had died and Peter still didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. The plots of land that belonged to Peter\u2019s family were all in a row so that he could see his parents and Bens little gravestones at the same time.</p><p>Despite being a legit superhero, he still felt like he disappointed them somehow. He didn\u2019t know why he just tended to think that way.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ben\u2026 Hi Mom\u2026 Hi dad\u2026\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cracked and he was thankful that the whole cemetery was empty. The cemetery was weirdly peaceful and he couldn\u2019t hear much outside of it. He felt alone. Which wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as he had tears rolling down his face that he had been keeping in all day.</p><p>\u201cI uh\u2026 I miss you\u2026 all of you\u2026 well, mostly Ben but I wouldn\u2019t mind you all coming back.\u201d Peter smiled sadly. \u201cI hope you\u2019d all be proud of me even though I\u2019m constantly doing dumb things\u2026\u201d He sat down on the grass and avoided looking at the engraved name of his uncle as if those were his eyes and he was ashamed.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really visited since you got here so I guess I have a lot to update you on. A lot of things have happened. First off, \u00a0I should confess that I\u2019m kind of a superhero illegal vigilante now. Surprise! And the thing is\u2026 it\u2019s because of you. Because I couldn\u2019t save you. I never wanted anyone else to feel like I did when you left. I never wanted some other kid to call their alive parent to tell them what happened\u2026\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t control the sob that forced itself out of him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t let that happen. No one deserves it. I don\u2019t want anyone else to lose a parent\u2026 or two\u2026 or three.\u201d His voice came out as more of a whisper. \u201cSometimes I forget\u2026 sometimes I forget that you\u2019re gone. And sometimes I can still feel your blood on my hands. I just\u2026 I guess you\u2019re still with me sometimes, even if it\u2019s not as much as I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I came here to say that I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t save you.\u201d Peter stood up after he ran out of things to say. He knew there was no one listening. It was just releasing some of his guilt to the grassy yard full of dead people. Peter was glad that one of his powers wasn\u2019t talking to the dead. That would be awkward.</p><p>He didn\u2019t jump when he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder. His spider-sense didn\u2019t warn him so it must be someone he trusted. Sure enough, he looked up and saw Mr. Stark.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d want to be alone\u2026\u201d Tony said in a more gentle voice than Peter had ever heard. Instead of answering, he just automatically leaned on his mentor. Tony just changed his hand from Peter\u2019s shoulder to around him in a comforting half hug.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Peter sighed as he quickly wiped away a couple of tears that he was embarrassed about having in front of Tony. Instead of being stand-offish like he normally was, Tony just squeezed Peter closer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem kid\u2026 Do you want to continue Hamlet-ing?\u201d Normally the tone of Tony\u2019s voice when he said things like this was much more snarky but this time it just felt like a joke to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2026 I think I\u2019ve said everything that I needed to say\u2026\u201d Peter muttered. He didn\u2019t really didn\u2019t want to talk anymore.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I talk to them?\u201d Tony asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to stop you from monologuing,\u201d Peter admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right about that,\u201d Tony turned towards the graves. \u201cHey uh, Hi Mary, Richard, Ben\u2026 I just wanted to thank you all. I will forever be grateful to you for raising this amazing kid. I have never met someone so kind, so strong, so caring, so\u2026 good than your kid. I know part of that is your fault so I want to thank you for it. It\u2019s my honor to help him and I promise that I won\u2019t let any of you down.\u201d He looked down at Peter when he heard a sniffle.</p><p>\u201cCome on kid\u2026 May was worried about you.\u201d Tony turned them away from the graves and started to slowly meander out of the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d Peter rasped out.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony stopped walking and adjusted Peter so that he was looking straight into the kid\u2019s eyes. \u201cSteve Rogers has nothing on you kiddo, you\u2019re going to be the best of us. We need more Peter\u2019s in the world.\u201d Tony wiped a tear from Peter\u2019s cheek with his thumb and gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cThey would be so proud of you, Do you know how I know that? I\u2019ve known you for like eight months and I am so fucking proud of you. Imagine how much they love you huh.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Peter took a moment to internalize that and once he did, he wrapped his arms around Tony with such speed and purpose that he knocked the breath out of him.

        "answer": "<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Steve called from the living room. Peter hesitated before going to his uncle carefully. Steve was engrossed in his laptop, a little confused on what he found.<br/></p><p>\u201cIs this you Tumblr?\u201d He asked, turning the laptop around so Peter can have a look at the screen. Peter\u2019s face drained of color as he recognized the URL at the top corner of the screen. It was his. </p><p>\u201cUhh, no,\u201d Peter said, with pursed lips. The back of his neck began to burn more as Steve narrowed his eyes towards the boy. He didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d He called loudly, making Peter whimper his finger flying to his lips. Steve got his answer. He smirked widely as Stark appeared in the doorframe. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, cap?\u201d He asked, looking from the man to the boy and quickly caught the red burning of Peter\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cPeter has a fan account of us,\u201d Steve announced, lifting the laptop to Tony\u2019s level. He bent down to get a good look and smiled brightly, putting his sunglasses on. Peter buried his face in his hands, mortified. \u201cPlease, stop.\u201d He begged.</p><p>Steve laughed softly, taking the computer back and scrolling through the content. Tony leaned on the back to the couch looking over Steve\u2019s shoulder as he searched. The posts were harmless, mostly of dialogue the team has said to each other. Some were pictures he had taken of them. Some group photos of all of them out to eat or at the amusement park. Many were filled with smiling with their arms around each other, laughing and just enjoying the moment. It made Steve\u2019s heart warm, seeing everyone together like that. </p><p>Other photos that were posted were taken around the house and seemed normal almost boring to both Tony and Rogers. Bruce reading on the couch. Natasha baking a cake with Tony\u2019s help in the kitchen. Sam taking a nap while sitting on the sofa with Bucky, Bucky\u2019s feet in Wilson\u2019s lap. Steve didn\u2019t get it. Especially since his blog was racking in at least 500,000 notes a post. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Tony asked, looking up at Peter who was still sinking into the couch, pretending he was invisible. Peter looked at his mentor and shrugged slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He replied quietly. \u201cPeople like seeing you guys live like them, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tony and Steve exchanged a glance and Tony shrugged. \u201cFine by me.\u201d He ended up saying, standing straight once again. \u201cJust don\u2019t leak\u2026anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter scrunched up his nose and nodded hastily. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p>",
