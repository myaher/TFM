Kirishima bit the inside of his cheek as he looked over her before slowly his hand moved from here it had been resting beside her head to her hair, brushing it out of her face and nearly giving (y/n) a heart attack in the process. <br/><br/>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful (y/n)-\u201d he murmured, as if not realizing he had said it outloud, (y/n) reddening immensely as she looked up to him surprised. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d she asked curiously, her eyebrows creasing as she attempted to take in the sentence that Kirishima knew she didn\u2019t believe.</p><p>Kirishima was silent as his eyes flickered across her face, heistating for a second longer on her lips and making (y/n) rethink what exactly was happening between them. From what had turned from two friends joking around to her being suddenly very worried about the intense look behind his opaque eyes. (y/n) felt her heart picking up in her chest as Kirishima let himself fall a little closer to her, his eyes jumping back to hers. <br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s just the truth \u2026\u201d he shrugged, (y/n) wondering if he was about to follow it up with something incredibly sarcastic before suddenly his face was startling close to hers, his breath ghosting over her lips as he rested his forehead against hers. \u201cIt\u2019s always been the truth- we were just too young to see it.\u201d he argued, as (y/n) lost the ability to breath as she noticed small things about her best friends face that she had never quite noticed before.<br/><br/>\u201cK- Kiri-\u201d she stuttered out again, to scared to do anything that might stop whatever was going on between them- because she didn\u2019t want it to stop.<br/><br/>Kirishima examined her eyes one more time before dropping his gaze again, a million thoughts flying through (y/n)\u2019s advanced brain and making it impossible for her to act on any one of them beside letting her eyes close slightly in anticipation \u2026</p><p>For a moment that never came \u2026</p><p>A sharp knock came at the door, pulling both of them back to reality and making Kirishima jump away from her quickly, rolling to his side and (y/n) jumping to sit straight as Kirishima\u2019s bedroom door was opened by his Mother. <br/><br/>\u201cHey, Atanei is here.\u201d she said, (y/n) hiding her bright red face behind her hair as Kirishima gave a cool and collected nod, \u201ccool- tell her I\u2019ll be down in just a sec, just have to get my shoes.\u201d he said easily- as if whatever had just happened was nothing more than a casual Saturday night together with her.</p><p>His mother gave an easy nod, Kirishima jumping to his feet, walking quickly to his closet to get his shoes as (y/n) tried to regain her ability to breath in air. <br/><br/>\u201cUh- \u2026 (y/n)?\u201d he asked, turning back to her, (y/n) looking up to him quickly, trying to appear as casual as he was \u201chmm?\u201d she squeaked out embarrassedly. \u00a0Kirishima looked to her before sighing, \u201cI\u2019ll try to be home early tonight- I really \u2026 I really don\u2019t want to date her (y/n) I- I\u2019m sorry \u2026\u201d he mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck and making (y/n) frown. <br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s&hellip; it\u2019s alright it\u2019s fine- I just \u2026 let\u2019s talk about it when you get home \u2026 she\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d she mumbled, rubbing her arm with her opposite hand, Kirishima pausing for a moment before giving a curt nod. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d he said briefly, (y/n) nodding, \u201csee ya\u201d</p>",

        "body": "<p>Momo\u2019s legs were shaking \u2013 they <i>never</i> shook. If her mother were here, there would be two red handprints on her thighs. She couldn\u2019t help it, though. She took a few deep breaths to compose herself and steady her accelerating heart rate, trying to distract herself by focusing on the meeting, and not on the girl a few seats away. It did not work, much to her frustration.</p><p>\u201cAny thoughts? Yaoyorozu?\u201d Aizawa fixated his dull eyes on her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She replied dumbly, his voice knocking her out of her thoughts. Every time he looked at her, she couldn\u2019t help but feel like they were back in the finals, with him erasing her quirk. Like that of a hawk\u2019s, scanning her movement and her thoughts. She quailed under his gaze.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;\u201d She flickered her eyes towards the blackboard. <i>What were they discussing about? Right, the training camp activities.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p>She wished she had remembered quicker, because after just a second of silence, Aizawa said,\u00a0\u201cKendo?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The girl in question shot a brief apologetic look at her, before offering her own suggestions, leaving Momo\u2019s face burning. <i>What\u2019s the matter with me? It\u2019s just a present. I\u2019m not asking her out or anything.</i></p><p>She mentally slapped herself for even thinking of that. Focus on the meeting. That\u2019s what you\u2019re here for anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Aizawa wrote some of Kendo\u2019s ideas down, then asked,\u00a0\u201cYaoyorozu. Any input?\u201d To which she responded promptly. Her homeroom teacher gave a acknowledging grunt and continued the list with her own suggestions.\u00a0</p><p>As she was speaking, she noted from the corner of her eye that Kendo\u2019s eyes were darting between the board and her, with that curious look, like a puppy seeing a ball for the first time. She saw it a few times during their internship with Uwabami, and it has stayed with her ever since.\u00a0</p><p><i>She\u2019s looking</i>, the mischievous part of her mind teased. She prayed that she wasn\u2019t blushing. Not now.\u00a0</p><p>After another ten minutes of discussion and cutting out ideas that wouldn\u2019t work, Aizawa concluded the meeting.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll take these to Vlad. We\u2019ll gather all four of you next week to confirm, and then you guys can get started on planning the game itself. Dismissed.\u201d</p><p>The two simultaneously stood up and thanked him. Before they could leave, Momo heard Aizawa call from behind her,\u00a0\u201cYaoyorozu. A word.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She gulped and turned around. Kendo gave her a last glance before leaving. <i>No</i>, she panicked. <i>How am I going to&hellip;</i></p><p>She was genuinely considering ignoring her teacher\u2019s words and booking it for the door, but she knew better than to disobey him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSensei?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>She expected a scolding. It was probably from that screw-up earlier, or did she forget to hand in the class forms to him? Did she miss out someone? She swore she counted 20. Or was it something entirely else she completely \u2013\u2013</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong? You seem off,\u201d Aizawa asked.\u00a0\u201cEver since this morning, you seemed jumpy.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo! No, everything\u2019s alright. Just&hellip;um, drank too much tea.\u201d She tried for a reassuring smile, but she doubted it was convincing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay&hellip;\u201d His demeanour didn\u2019t change. It was difficult to tell what he was feeling aside from when he was angry.\u00a0\u201cWell, don\u2019t go overboard on that, then. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She thanked him, grabbed her bag and walked as calmly as she could do the door. The second she shut it behind her, she raced down the corridor. <i>Could I still catch her? How long did that take? What if she went a different way?</i></p><p>\u201cMomo!\u201d Kendo\u2019s voice made her skid to a halt. She was by a pillar, waving her over.<br/></p><p>\u201cKendo! Uh, hi! Were you waiting for me?\u201d Momo walked towards her. They began walking out of the school.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah! You looked funny just now. What did Aizawa-sensei call you for?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUm, same thing as you, actually.\u201d <i>She was waiting for me? </i>This never happened.\u00a0</p><p><i>Give it to her! It\u2019s the perfect time! </i>She screamed at herself. She ignored it. There had to be some better moment so it wouldn\u2019t be so weird&hellip;</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, that means it\u2019s obvious. You alright?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019m good. Thanks for asking.\u201d Momo\u2019s bag suddenly felt ten times heavier with what she was carrying, even though it was as light as a feather. Her heart was beating unnaturally fast, and the sweat pouring from her forehead&hellip;that was from her running earlier, right?<br/></p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound convinced.\u00a0\u201cWell, alright.\u201d Then she switched the subject.\u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you glad these meetings are almost done? Just one last planning session before the camp! All those weeks I could have spent sleeping instead&hellip;\u201d She sighed dramatically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll never get those back now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;\u201d Her voice trailed off. <i>I always looked forward to the meetings,\u00a0</i>She wanted to say. It was the only time she had a legitimate excuse to be in the same room as her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou must have enjoyed them, though. You showed up to every meeting. Ibara was pretty surprised,\u201d She said.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Momo recalled taking ten minutes to persuade Iida to let her attend all the meetings. That guy was insistent, but her insistence won in the end.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHeh, yeah, I suppose.\u201d She ran a hand through her hair. <i>GIVE IT NOW! </i>A part of her yelled.<br/></p><p><i>NOT YET! </i>The other shot back.</p><p>\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s nice of you to do so. You\u2019re a good vice chairperson.\u201d Kendo added. Momo\u2019s heart crawled into her windpipe when she heard that.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d She managed to say,\u00a0\u201cYou too, keeping Monoma in check and all.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t get me started on him.\u201d She pulled a face, and Momo giggled, causing Kendo to smile, then it faded. \u201cOn his behalf, I\u2019m really sorry for all his, uh&hellip;annoying-ness.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d She waved dismissively.\u00a0\u201cWe deal with it.\u201d<br/></p><p>They were walking down the hill. \u201cSo, where you heading to?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;\u201d Momo was hesitant to answer. Kendo blinked, before she slapped herself.\u00a0\u201cRight, I forgot you had a&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Driver. Chauffeur. Something only Momo and a few other rich people at U.A had. Momo didn\u2019t want it in the first place, but her mother was adamant that wouldn\u2019t have her daughter take public transport, so she agreed on the condition that he would pick her up at the train station itself. Kendo only knew about it due to the internship.\u00a0</p><p>Another awkward silence drifted over the two.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Kendo offered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing to apologise for. It\u2019s a weird subject,\u201d Momo replied, mentally punching herself for making Kendo feel bad.\u00a0<br/></p><p>They had reached the foot of the hill.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m crossing the road here.\u201d She pointed at the bus stop on the opposite street. \u201cBye!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Momo called. Kendo tilted her head.\u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>She was definitely blushing. Her face felt the same during the Todoroki-Midoriya match in its final moments: burning hot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2013I have something for you.\u201d She slung her bag over and unzipped it, bringing out \u2013<br/></p><p>\u201cA pair of gloves?\u201d Kendo stared at them.\u00a0\u201cThank you, but&hellip;why?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou mentioned during the internship that you couldn\u2019t get a costume that could fit your hands when you used your quirk, since no material could stretch to that size and still be useful as a weapon or protective layer. But this is made from genetically modified silkworms developed in America, so the companies here wouldn\u2019t have access to it. It\u2019s strong as steel but still flexible, so I thought&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou bought them from America?\u201d Kendo gaped at her, her question answering itself \u201cOh, Momo&hellip;you didn\u2019t&hellip;make them with your quirk, did you?\u201d<br/></p><p>Momo meekly nodded. Kendo took the gloves from her, then before Momo could retract her hands, Kendo\u2019s eyes narrowed, and she said, \u201cWait. Don\u2019t!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Before Momo knew what was happening, Kendo had grabbed her left hand and was inspecting it. It began to tremble at her warm touch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis patch is paler. I\u2019m guessing from your quirk? From making these?\u201d She held up the gloves with her other hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo! I spilt some soup and \u2013\u201d Momo stuttered.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d She threatened.\u00a0</p><p>Momo dipped her head.\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d she said after a brief silence. There was no getting anything past her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow long did this take?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cA few days. Getting the material correct was the hard part,\u201d She muttered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd that was what caused&hellip;\u201d Kendo let her hands fall to her side.\u00a0\u201cMomo&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear them. Maybe suggest it to the costume companies and they can modify your costume&hellip;or something. I don\u2019t know why I did this. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d She turned to leave from her embarrassment, but Kendo grabbed her arm with a grip firm enough to stop her from leaving, but gentle enough for Momo to want to melt in her hands.<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s very thoughtful of you,\u201d Kendo murmured, looking directly into Momo\u2019s eyes. <i>She\u2019s blushing.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Momo squeaked, her arm feeling like putty.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Kendo let go of her arm.\u00a0\u201cSo&hellip;see you at the next meeting?\u201d She sounded hopeful.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d She responded with a sheepish smile. Kendo flashed her own grin before the two parted.<br/></p>",

Momo\u2019s heart crawled into her windpipe when she heard that.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d She managed to say,\u00a0\u201cYou too, keeping Monoma in check and all.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t get me started on him.\u201d She pulled a face, and Momo giggled, causing Kendo to smile, then it faded. \u201cOn his behalf, I\u2019m really sorry for all his, uh\u2026annoying-ness.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d She waved dismissively.\u00a0\u201cWe deal with it.\u201d<br></p><p>They were walking down the hill. \u201cSo, where you heading to?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Momo was hesitant to answer. Kendo blinked, before she slapped herself.\u00a0\u201cRight, I forgot you had a\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Driver. Chauffeur. Something only Momo and a few other rich people at U.A had. Momo didn\u2019t want it in the first place, but her mother was adamant that wouldn\u2019t have her daughter take public transport, so she agreed on the condition that he would pick her up at the train station itself. Kendo only knew about it due to the internship.\u00a0</p><p>Another awkward silence drifted over the two.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Kendo offered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNothing to apologise for. It\u2019s a weird subject,\u201d Momo replied, mentally punching herself for making Kendo feel bad.\u00a0<br></p><p>They had reached the foot of the hill.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m crossing the road here.\u201d She pointed at the bus stop on the opposite street. \u201cBye!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Momo called. Kendo tilted her head.\u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She was definitely blushing. Her face felt the same during the Todoroki-Midoriya match in its final moments: burning hot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2013I have something for you.\u201d She slung her bag over and unzipped it, bringing out \u2013<br></p><p>\u201cA pair of gloves?\u201d Kendo stared at them.\u00a0\u201cThank you, but\u2026why?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou mentioned during the internship that you couldn\u2019t get a costume that could fit your hands when you used your quirk, since no material could stretch to that size and still be useful as a weapon or protective layer. But this is made from genetically modified silkworms developed in America, so the companies here wouldn\u2019t have access to it. It\u2019s strong as steel but still flexible, so I thought\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou bought them from America?\u201d Kendo gaped at her, her question answering itself \u201cOh, Momo\u2026you didn\u2019t\u2026make them with your quirk, did you?\u201d<br></p><p>Momo meekly nodded. Kendo took the gloves from her, then before Momo could retract her hands, Kendo\u2019s eyes narrowed, and she said, \u201cWait. Don\u2019t!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Before Momo knew what was happening, Kendo had grabbed her left hand and was inspecting it. It began to tremble at her warm touch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis patch is paler. I\u2019m guessing from your quirk? From making these?\u201d She held up the gloves with her other hand.<br></p><p>\u201cNo! I spilt some soup and \u2013\u201d Momo stuttered.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d She threatened.\u00a0</p><p>Momo dipped her head.\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d she said after a brief silence. There was no getting anything past her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow long did this take?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cA few days. Getting the material correct was the hard part,\u201d She muttered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd that was what caused\u2026\u201d Kendo let her hands fall to her side.\u00a0\u201cMomo\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear them. Maybe suggest it to the costume companies and they can modify your costume\u2026or something. I don\u2019t know why I did this. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d She turned to leave from her embarrassment, but Kendo grabbed her arm with a grip firm enough to stop her from leaving, but gentle enough for Momo to want to melt in her hands.<br></p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s very thoughtful of you,\u201d Kendo murmured, looking directly into Momo\u2019s eyes. <i>She\u2019s blushing.\u00a0</i><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Momo squeaked, her arm feeling like putty.\u00a0<br></p><p>Kendo let go of her arm.\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026see you at the next meeting?\u201d She sounded hopeful.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d She responded with a sheepish smile. Kendo flashed her own grin before the two parted.<br></p>",

She couldn\u2019t help it, though. She took a few deep breaths to compose herself and steady her accelerating heart rate, trying to distract herself by focusing on the meeting, and not on the girl a few seats away. It did not work, much to her frustration.</p><p>\u201cAny thoughts? Yaoyorozu?\u201d Aizawa fixated his dull eyes on her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She replied dumbly, his voice knocking her out of her thoughts. Every time he looked at her, she couldn\u2019t help but feel like they were back in the finals, with him erasing her quirk. Like that of a hawk\u2019s, scanning her movement and her thoughts. She quailed under his gaze.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d She flickered her eyes towards the blackboard. <i>What were they discussing about? Right, the training camp activities.\u00a0</i><br></p><p>She wished she had remembered quicker, because after just a second of silence, Aizawa said,\u00a0\u201cKendo?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The girl in question shot a brief apologetic look at her, before offering her own suggestions, leaving Momo\u2019s face burning. <i>What\u2019s the matter with me? It\u2019s just a present. I\u2019m not asking her out or anything.</i></p><p>She mentally slapped herself for even thinking of that. Focus on the meeting. That\u2019s what you\u2019re here for anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Aizawa wrote some of Kendo\u2019s ideas down, then asked,\u00a0\u201cYaoyorozu. Any input?\u201d To which she responded promptly. Her homeroom teacher gave a acknowledging grunt and continued the list with her own suggestions.\u00a0</p><p>As she was speaking, she noted from the corner of her eye that Kendo\u2019s eyes were darting between the board and her, with that curious look, like a puppy seeing a ball for the first time. She saw it a few times during their internship with Uwabami, and it has stayed with her ever since.\u00a0</p><p><i>She\u2019s looking</i>, the mischievous part of her mind teased. She prayed that she wasn\u2019t blushing. Not now.\u00a0</p><p>After another ten minutes of discussion and cutting out ideas that wouldn\u2019t work, Aizawa concluded the meeting.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll take these to Vlad. We\u2019ll gather all four of you next week to confirm, and then you guys can get started on planning the game itself. Dismissed.\u201d</p><p>The two simultaneously stood up and thanked him. Before they could leave, Momo heard Aizawa call from behind her,\u00a0\u201cYaoyorozu. A word.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She gulped and turned around. Kendo gave her a last glance before leaving. <i>No</i>, she panicked. <i>How am I going to\u2026</i></p><p>She was genuinely considering ignoring her teacher\u2019s words and booking it for the door, but she knew better than to disobey him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSensei?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She expected a scolding. It was probably from that screw-up earlier, or did she forget to hand in the class forms to him? Did she miss out someone? She swore she counted 20. Or was it something entirely else she completely \u2013\u2013</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong? You seem off,\u201d Aizawa asked.\u00a0\u201cEver since this morning, you seemed jumpy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo! No, everything\u2019s alright. Just\u2026um, drank too much tea.\u201d She tried for a reassuring smile, but she doubted it was convincing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d His demeanour didn\u2019t change. It was difficult to tell what he was feeling aside from when he was angry.\u00a0\u201cWell, don\u2019t go overboard on that, then. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She thanked him, grabbed her bag and walked as calmly as she could do the door. The second she shut it behind her, she raced down the corridor. <i>Could I still catch her? How long did that take? What if she went a different way?</i></p><p>\u201cMomo!\u201d Kendo\u2019s voice made her skid to a halt. She was by a pillar, waving her over.<br></p><p>\u201cKendo! Uh, hi! Were you waiting for me?\u201d Momo walked towards her. They began walking out of the school.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah! You looked funny just now. What did Aizawa-sensei call you for?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUm, same thing as you, actually.\u201d <i>She was waiting for me? </i>This never happened.\u00a0</p><p><i>Give it to her! It\u2019s the perfect time! </i>She screamed at herself. She ignored it. There had to be some better moment so it wouldn\u2019t be so weird\u2026</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, that means it\u2019s obvious. You alright?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019m good. Thanks for asking.\u201d Momo\u2019s bag suddenly felt ten times heavier with what she was carrying, even though it was as light as a feather. Her heart was beating unnaturally fast, and the sweat pouring from her forehead\u2026that was from her running earlier, right?<br></p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound convinced.\u00a0\u201cWell, alright.\u201d Then she switched the subject.\u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you glad these meetings are almost done? Just one last planning session before the camp! All those weeks I could have spent sleeping instead\u2026\u201d She sighed dramatically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll never get those back now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Her voice trailed off. <i>I always looked forward to the meetings,\u00a0</i>She wanted to say. It was the only time she had a legitimate excuse to be in the same room as her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou must have enjoyed them, though. You showed up to every meeting. Ibara was pretty surprised,\u201d She said.\u00a0<br></p><p>Momo recalled taking ten minutes to persuade Iida to let her attend all the meetings. That guy was insistent, but her insistence won in the end.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHeh, yeah, I suppose.\u201d She ran a hand through her hair. <i>GIVE IT NOW! </i>A part of her yelled.<br></p><p><i>NOT YET! </i>The other shot back.</p><p>\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s nice of you to do so.

It was difficult to tell what he was feeling aside from when he was angry.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t go overboard on that, then. You&rsquo;re dismissed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She thanked him, grabbed her bag and walked as calmly as she could do the door. The second she shut it behind her, she raced down the corridor. <i>Could I still catch her? How long did that take? What if she went a different way?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Momo!&rdquo; Kendo&rsquo;s voice made her skid to a halt. She was by a pillar, waving her over.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Kendo! Uh, hi! Were you waiting for me?&rdquo; Momo walked towards her. They began walking out of the school.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! You looked funny just now. What did Aizawa-sensei call you for?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Um, same thing as you, actually.&rdquo; <i>She was waiting for me? </i>This never happened.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Give it to her! It&rsquo;s the perfect time! </i>She screamed at herself. She ignored it. There had to be some better moment so it wouldn&rsquo;t be so weird&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Well, that means it&rsquo;s obvious. You alright?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;m good. Thanks for asking.&rdquo; Momo&rsquo;s bag suddenly felt ten times heavier with what she was carrying, even though it was as light as a feather. Her heart was beating unnaturally fast, and the sweat pouring from her forehead&hellip;that was from her running earlier, right?<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t sound convinced.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, alright.&rdquo; Then she switched the subject.&nbsp;&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad these meetings are almost done? Just one last planning session before the camp! All those weeks I could have spent sleeping instead&hellip;&rdquo; She sighed dramatically.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get those back now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice trailed off. <i>I always looked forward to the meetings,&nbsp;</i>She wanted to say. It was the only time she had a legitimate excuse to be in the same room as her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You must have enjoyed them, though. You showed up to every meeting. Ibara was pretty surprised,&rdquo; She said.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Momo recalled taking ten minutes to persuade Iida to let her attend all the meetings. That guy was insistent, but her insistence won in the end.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Heh, yeah, I suppose.&rdquo; She ran a hand through her hair. <i>GIVE IT NOW! </i>A part of her yelled.<br /></p><p><i>NOT YET! </i>The other shot back.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if you didn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s nice of you to do so. You&rsquo;re a good vice chairperson.&rdquo; Kendo added. Momo&rsquo;s heart crawled into her windpipe when she heard that.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; She managed to say,&nbsp;&ldquo;You too, keeping Monoma in check and all.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, don&rsquo;t get me started on him.&rdquo; She pulled a face, and Momo giggled, causing Kendo to smile, then it faded. &ldquo;On his behalf, I&rsquo;m really sorry for all his, uh&hellip;annoying-ness.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; She waved dismissively.&nbsp;&ldquo;We deal with it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>They were walking down the hill. &ldquo;So, where you heading to?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo; Momo was hesitant to answer. Kendo blinked, before she slapped herself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Right, I forgot you had a&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Driver. Chauffeur. Something only Momo and a few other rich people at U.A had. Momo didn&rsquo;t want it in the first place, but her mother was adamant that wouldn&rsquo;t have her daughter take public transport, so she agreed on the condition that he would pick her up at the train station itself. Kendo only knew about it due to the internship.&nbsp;</p><p>Another awkward silence drifted over the two.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Kendo offered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing to apologise for. It&rsquo;s a weird subject,&rdquo; Momo replied, mentally punching herself for making Kendo feel bad.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>They had reached the foot of the hill.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crossing the road here.&rdquo; She pointed at the bus stop on the opposite street. &ldquo;Bye!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Momo called. Kendo tilted her head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She was definitely blushing. Her face felt the same during the Todoroki-Midoriya match in its final moments: burning hot.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash;I have something for you.&rdquo; She slung her bag over and unzipped it, bringing out &ndash;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A pair of gloves?&rdquo; Kendo stared at them.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, but&hellip;why?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You mentioned during the internship that you couldn&rsquo;t get a costume that could fit your hands when you used your quirk, since no material could stretch to that size and still be useful as a weapon or protective layer. But this is made from genetically modified silkworms developed in America, so the companies here wouldn&rsquo;t have access to it. It&rsquo;s strong as steel but still flexible, so I thought&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You bought them from America?&rdquo; Kendo gaped at her, her question answering itself &ldquo;Oh, Momo&hellip;you didn&rsquo;t&hellip;make them with your quirk, did you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Momo meekly nodded. Kendo took the gloves from her, then before Momo could retract her hands, Kendo&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, and she said, &ldquo;Wait. Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Before Momo knew what was happening, Kendo had grabbed her left hand and was inspecting it. It began to tremble at her warm touch.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This patch is paler. I&rsquo;m guessing from your quirk? From making these?&rdquo; She held up the gloves with her other hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No! I spilt some soup and &ndash;&rdquo; Momo stuttered.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me,&rdquo; She threatened.&nbsp;</p><p>Momo dipped her head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said after a brief silence. There was no getting anything past her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How long did this take?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A few days. Getting the material correct was the hard part,&rdquo; She muttered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And that was what caused&hellip;&rdquo; Kendo let her hands fall to her side.&nbsp;&ldquo;Momo&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to wear them. Maybe suggest it to the costume companies and they can modify your costume&hellip;or something. I don&rsquo;t know why I did this. I&rsquo;ll be going now.&rdquo; She turned to leave from her embarrassment, but Kendo grabbed her arm with a grip firm enough to stop her from leaving, but gentle enough for Momo to want to melt in her hands.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. It&rsquo;s very thoughtful of you,&rdquo; Kendo murmured, looking directly into Momo&rsquo;s eyes. <i>She&rsquo;s blushing.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Momo squeaked, her arm feeling like putty.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Kendo let go of her arm.&nbsp;&ldquo;So&hellip;see you at the next meeting?&rdquo; She sounded hopeful.</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; She responded with a sheepish smile. Kendo flashed her own grin before the two parted.<br /></p>",
