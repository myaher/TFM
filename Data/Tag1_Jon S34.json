Because Sansa knew Jon is in danger and the North is in danger. Where did she come up with that idea that Jon is in danger? oh only because Tyrion is SCARED of Danaerys, the same Tyrion who has been part of a family of tyrants, (Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin) is scared of this dragon riding Targaryen. Oh did we mention a Targaryen? Yeah the ones who burn people and CONQUERS 7 Kingdoms because they CAN. The ones who were cast out in a rebellion and was forced to flee which has given her a motive for revenge and out for blood? Yeah that Targaryen. Sansa knows how power hungry people works, she knows very well what lengths they will go to keep a secret and Jon&rsquo;s secret is bound to make him very vulnerable and a threat to Danaerys because he IS the rightful heir to the throne. Let&rsquo;s face it. Sooner or later, Jon&rsquo;s secret will out and as more and more Danaerys acquires power then more and more she will grow paranoid and guard that power jealously. She will always be afraid that Jon will usurped her rulership and she very well knew Jon is within his rights because she is not the rightful ruler Jon is.  She herself has always put so much stock in the rightful ruler scenario because that has always been her justification in burning people and taking from people what was never hers.  Danaerys also knows that people in Westeros will never love her but will always fear her so her paranoia will grow and grow until she is going to do something about Jon&rsquo;s secret&hellip; She was already paranoid before with Tyrion when he asked her about heirs. She was already paranoid with Varys when she warns Varys that if he betrays her she will burn him alive. And she never likes being questioned but unfortunately she will always be surrounded by people who will question her if she wants to continue to rule over Westeros. The people of Westeros have gone through so many wars for them to ever accept power hungry tyrants lying down ever again. It was the reason Joffrey was killed because he is one. It was the reason Ramsey was killed because he is one. It was the reason Stannis was killed because he is one. </p><p>Sansa is already a dozen or more steps ahead of everyone because she already had lived through this exact same scenario before with the Lannisters where her father ended up dead, her becoming a prisoner, her mother and brothers murdered and The NORTH becoming the one to experience the biggest collateral damage of all because of a Secret. So she already knows that it will definitely become a problem for Jon. Jon is in danger, the same way her father Ned Stark was in danger and the same way her grandfather and uncle were in danger. Jon has a birth secret and he is under a Targaryen that has already burned people alive in Westeros (remember the Battle of Goldroad everyone? And the Tarlys?) and worst of all that same Targaryen knows Jon&rsquo;s secret.</p><p>Littlefinger is a real creep but he really did gave Sansa the best advice</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight in the North, or the South. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind&rdquo; </p><p>The same way Varys knew what Danaerys will do to King&rsquo;s Landing and what will happen when she goes to attack King&rsquo;s Landing, Sansa already knew that Danaerys will do that. It wasn&rsquo;t Sansa telling Tyrion the secret that made Danaerys decide to attack and burn King&rsquo;s Landing even after they surrender.   Nope. Danaerys already made that decision when her dragon died and Missandei was beheaded in front of her. She already has always been out for blood for the family that headed the Rebellion before and cast her out and forced her to flee. She already wanted to reign fire and blood on them. Rhaegal and Missandei getting killed was just the last straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back. Sansa knew that because she is already twenty or more steps ahead of them and Varys for sure definitely knows that when he talked with Danaerys advising her to remember that there are innocents out there in the keep. Varys looked into Daenarys&rsquo; eyes and he knew who she is and what she will do. Varys has served many many tyrants for a long time and has long been acquainted with tyrants and definitely recognizes one when it&rsquo;s staring at him in the face when finally Danaerys sheds her &ldquo;savior&rdquo; persona in front of them. Remember what Arya said to Jon? &ldquo;I know a killer when I see one&rdquo; that is why Arya&rsquo;s instincts also tells her that she doesn&rsquo;t trust Danaerys. It wasn&rsquo;t just Sansa who doesn&rsquo;t trust her. </p><p>Sansa wanted Jon to have allies there. Sansa wanted Jon to have a fighting chance just in case but more so Sansa wants to let Jon know that she still chooses Jon as her king. And she will always choose Jon as her King. You witnessed it when she told Bran that she loves him but he is not her king and not the North&rsquo;s King and we knew that when she told Jon &ldquo;the North lost their King&rdquo;. Oh, by the way Jon chose Sansa too. He chose to protect Sansa and keep his promise to her to protect her. </p><p>In conclusion, and this is how I imagine what happens next in their story. </p><p>Knowing Sansa, her first act as Queen in the North will be to pardon Jon and to declare him a Stark. How can she not?  when she knows Jon will want to go home to Winterfell. The same way Bran will yearn to go home to Winterfell even though he is King of the South and Arya will always want to go home to Winterfell after her exploring. Winterfell is their home and the wolves will always come back again. So, Sansa wi\u013al pull a Nick Fury on the decision that was made as punishment for Jon during the second dragonpit summit and will tell Bran and the Southern Lords that the Wall is of the North and since She is Queen in the North then she can pardon whoever she wants to pardon in the North! And declare to all the North that Jon Snow is free to finally come home at last to Winterfell. And in honour of what Jon Snow did in uniting the North,  leading the Army of the Living to fight the Army of the Dead and protecting all of Westeros by killing the Dragon Queen stopping her from burning more innocents, women and children ever again, she declares Jon Snow as Jon Stark, Protector of the Realm. </p><p>I doubt Bran will object and Tyrion and the council certainly won&rsquo;t object. Oh and the Unsullied??? They are already living in peace in Naath so why should they go back to Westeros when they would just face all of Westeros in the battle now that the people of Westeros have finally united in one common goal. Why would Greyworm risked that. So yeah Sansa can definitely do what she wants. And what does she want? To save Jon and bring him home. That is what she wants.</p>",

Sansa knows how power hungry people works, she knows very well what lengths they will go to keep a secret and Jon\u2019s secret is bound to make him very vulnerable and a threat to Danaerys because he IS the rightful heir to the throne. Let\u2019s face it. Sooner or later, Jon\u2019s secret will out and as more and more Danaerys acquires power then more and more she will grow paranoid and guard that power jealously. She will always be afraid that Jon will usurped her rulership and she very well knew Jon is within his rights because she is not the rightful ruler Jon is.  She herself has always put so much stock in the rightful ruler scenario because that has always been her justification in burning people and taking from people what was never hers.  Danaerys also knows that people in Westeros will never love her but will always fear her so her paranoia will grow and grow until she is going to do something about Jon\u2019s secret\u2026 She was already paranoid before with Tyrion when he asked her about heirs. She was already paranoid with Varys when she warns Varys that if he betrays her she will burn him alive. And she never likes being questioned but unfortunately she will always be surrounded by people who will question her if she wants to continue to rule over Westeros. The people of Westeros have gone through so many wars for them to ever accept power hungry tyrants lying down ever again. It was the reason Joffrey was killed because he is one. It was the reason Ramsey was killed because he is one. It was the reason Stannis was killed because he is one. </p><p>Sansa is already a dozen or more steps ahead of everyone because she already had lived through this exact same scenario before with the Lannisters where her father ended up dead, her becoming a prisoner, her mother and brothers murdered and The NORTH becoming the one to experience the biggest collateral damage of all because of a Secret. So she already knows that it will definitely become a problem for Jon. Jon is in danger, the same way her father Ned Stark was in danger and the same way her grandfather and uncle were in danger. Jon has a birth secret and he is under a Targaryen that has already burned people alive in Westeros (remember the Battle of Goldroad everyone? And the Tarlys?) and worst of all that same Targaryen knows Jon\u2019s secret.</p><p>Littlefinger is a real creep but he really did gave Sansa the best advice</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight in the North, or the South. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind\u201d </p><p>The same way Varys knew what Danaerys will do to King\u2019s Landing and what will happen when she goes to attack King\u2019s Landing, Sansa already knew that Danaerys will do that. It wasn\u2019t Sansa telling Tyrion the secret that made Danaerys decide to attack and burn King\u2019s Landing even after they surrender.   Nope. Danaerys already made that decision when her dragon died and Missandei was beheaded in front of her. She already has always been out for blood for the family that headed the Rebellion before and cast her out and forced her to flee. She already wanted to reign fire and blood on them. Rhaegal and Missandei getting killed was just the last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Sansa knew that because she is already twenty or more steps ahead of them and Varys for sure definitely knows that when he talked with Danaerys advising her to remember that there are innocents out there in the keep. Varys looked into Daenarys\u2019 eyes and he knew who she is and what she will do. Varys has served many many tyrants for a long time and has long been acquainted with tyrants and definitely recognizes one when it\u2019s staring at him in the face when finally Danaerys sheds her \u201csavior\u201d persona in front of them. Remember what Arya said to Jon? \u201cI know a killer when I see one\u201d that is why Arya\u2019s instincts also tells her that she doesn\u2019t trust Danaerys. It wasn\u2019t just Sansa who doesn\u2019t trust her. </p><p>Sansa wanted Jon to have allies there. Sansa wanted Jon to have a fighting chance just in case but more so Sansa wants to let Jon know that she still chooses Jon as her king. And she will always choose Jon as her King. You witnessed it when she told Bran that she loves him but he is not her king and not the North\u2019s King and we knew that when she told Jon \u201cthe North lost their King\u201d. Oh, by the way Jon chose Sansa too. He chose to protect Sansa and keep his promise to her to protect her. </p><p>In conclusion, and this is how I imagine what happens next in their story. </p><p>Knowing Sansa, her first act as Queen in the North will be to pardon Jon and to declare him a Stark. How can she not?  when she knows Jon will want to go home to Winterfell. The same way Bran will yearn to go home to Winterfell even though he is King of the South and Arya will always want to go home to Winterfell after her exploring. Winterfell is their home and the wolves will always come back again. So, Sansa wi\u013al pull a Nick Fury on the decision that was made as punishment for Jon during the second dragonpit summit and will tell Bran and the Southern Lords that the Wall is of the North and since She is Queen in the North then she can pardon whoever she wants to pardon in the North! And declare to all the North that Jon Snow is free to finally come home at last to Winterfell. And in honour of what Jon Snow did in uniting the North,  leading the Army of the Living to fight the Army of the Dead and protecting all of Westeros by killing the Dragon Queen stopping her from burning more innocents, women and children ever again, she declares Jon Snow as Jon Stark, Protector of the Realm. </p><p>I doubt Bran will object and Tyrion and the council certainly won\u2019t object. Oh and the Unsullied??? They are already living in peace in Naath so why should they go back to Westeros when they would just face all of Westeros in the battle now that the people of Westeros have finally united in one common goal. Why would Greyworm risked that. So yeah Sansa can definitely do what she wants. And what does she want? To save Jon and bring him home. That is what she wants.</p></p>",

It&rsquo;s easy. Because Sansa knew Jon is in danger and the North is in danger. Where did she come up with that idea that Jon is in danger? oh only because Tyrion is SCARED of Danaerys, the same Tyrion who has been part of a family of tyrants, (Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin) is scared of this dragon riding Targaryen.
