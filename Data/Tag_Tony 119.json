She just has time to whisper \u201cit\u2019s \nhim. It\u2019s my Stephen\u201d to Tony before Tony is whisked away through the \nportal. And Tony, dimly remembering Pepper\u2019s stories of an arrogant \nasshole with a well-hidden heart of gold, tries to protect Stephen. First on Earth, then on the Donut ship. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to see through the arrogant facade and see the real man beneath it and he understands what Pepper has seen in him all those years ago. Tony rather likes the whole package, inside and out.<br/></li><li>Stephen realizes that Pepper must have told Tony about him and doesn\u2019t know how to feel about it. When he looks into the different futures he sees timelines where he gets together with Pepper again after Tony\u2019s death at Thanos\u2019 hands; he sees timelines where he and Tony end up after Pepper\u2019s. He sees himself die and Pepper and Tony lead happy lives. A thousand variations of the same theme, over and over again.</li><li>He falls in love again with Pepper and realizes that he is very much capable of falling in love with Tony if he\u2019s given a little bit of time to do so.<br/></li><li>There is one, just one, timeline where the three of them end up together. But it\u2019s also the most unlikely one, shrouded in uncertainty and the path into that future is so insanely twisted and long that Stephen rejects it out of hand without looking at the details and chooses one where Thanos is defeated with minimal deaths and Pepper and Tony get their happy end.</li><li>But Pepper is stubborn and even the few minutes in the park have been enough to let her see that Stephen\u2019s not in a good shape. Mentally or physically. So first she goes to rescue Tony only to find him in the middle of rescuing himself. They then work together to bring all the lost ones back - including a reluctant Stephen who tries to hide himself away after the dust (ha!) has settled.</li><li>Pepper is not satisfied with that. She gets the location of the Sanctum from Tony and goes over there to speak to Stephen. She almost wants to cry when she really sees the shaking ruin of Stephen\u2019s beautiful hands and doesn\u2019t leave until he has accepted a dinner invitation. She hugs him and doesn\u2019t want to let him go again.</li><li>Pepper\u2019s old feelings for Stephen reawaken. Tony beings to develop feelings for him. They begin to talk if it might be possible to add Stephen into their relationship. Pepper has always known that Stephen is bi and that Tony is exactly his type. Stephen is already so in love with both of them it hurts but much too afraid to even think about the possibilities. He doesn\u2019t want to \u201csteal\u201d one of them form the other and the thought of a triad doesn\u2019t really occur to him.<br/></li><li>Pepper - with Tony\u2019s active encouragement - pursues Stephen and tries to rekindle the affair.</li><li>Tony and Stephen spend more and more time together and Tony tries to seduce Stephen.</li><li>Poor Stephen is confused as hell. And also turned on like never before in his life.</li><li>Wong calls him an idiot who doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of him.<br/></li><li>He finally understands after yet another dinner of three when Tony decides \u201cfuck it!\u201d and stands up, puts his hands on Stephen\u2019s face and just kisses him as if his life depends on it while Pepper watches them with the biggest smile on her face before she pushes Tony away to kiss Stephen herself.</li><li>Stephen feels like the biggest idiot and must lucky person in the history of the multiverse at the same time.</li><li>The next morning Stephen wakes with his head on Pepper\u2019s chest and his back pressed against Tony\u2019s. Peppers fingers are wrapped around his right wrist and Tony has a possessive hand on his hip. He\u2019s too warm and feels trapped but you couldn\u2019t pay him enough to even move an inch.</li><li>Even the Cloak looks at him with an \u201ctook you long enough\u201d gesture.<br/></li><li>Tony and Pepper have talked things to death long beforehand and know where they stand and what they want but Stephen is still stunned when he realizes that this isn\u2019t an affair but a relationship for the rest of his life.</li></ul><p><b>Bonus:</b></p><ul><li>Tony turns into the caretaker of their family while Pepper is busy being a CEO and Stephen\u2019s responsibilites as Sorcerer Supreme grow and grow.<br/></li><li><p>Pepper and Tony both always pay special attention to Stephen\u2019s hands without being annoying or overbearing about it.<br/></p></li><li><p>Stephen learns how to handle Tony\u2019s chronic pain and to recognize the signs of a bad day.</p></li><li><p>Stephen and Tony are great in giving Pepper the space she needs when one of her migraines hit and she just wants to be left alone for a while.</p></li><li><p>Pepper and Tony both learn how to wrap the not only decorative bindings around Stephens wrists and arms and delight in getting him out of them at the end of the day. Tony especially loves to unwrap the leather belts around his waist one at a time even though he knows how to get Stephen out of them in under five seconds.</p></li><li><p>Over time this might even develop into a little bit of light bondage fun in the bedroom.</p></li></ul><p>(Yes, I totally stole that dinner thing from the James McGraw/Miranda &amp; Thomas Hamilton love triangle in Black Sails.)</p><p>\u2728</p><p><a href=\"https://amethyst-noir.tumblr.com/tagged/i-wish-you-would-write-a-fic-where...\">I wish you would write a fic where\u2026</a> | <a href=\"https://amethyst-noir.tumblr.com/ask\">send me another one<br/></a></p>",

She just has time to whisper \u201cit\u2019s \nhim. It\u2019s my Stephen\u201d to Tony before Tony is whisked away through the \nportal. And Tony, dimly remembering Pepper\u2019s stories of an arrogant \nasshole with a well-hidden heart of gold, tries to protect Stephen. First on Earth, then on the Donut ship. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to see through the arrogant facade and see the real man beneath it and he understands what Pepper has seen in him all those years ago. Tony rather likes the whole package, inside and out.<br></li><li>Stephen realizes that Pepper must have told Tony about him and doesn\u2019t know how to feel about it. When he looks into the different futures he sees timelines where he gets together with Pepper again after Tony\u2019s death at Thanos\u2019 hands; he sees timelines where he and Tony end up after Pepper\u2019s. He sees himself die and Pepper and Tony lead happy lives. A thousand variations of the same theme, over and over again.</li><li>He falls in love again with Pepper and realizes that he is very much capable of falling in love with Tony if he\u2019s given a little bit of time to do so.<br></li><li>There is one, just one, timeline where the three of them end up together. But it\u2019s also the most unlikely one, shrouded in uncertainty and the path into that future is so insanely twisted and long that Stephen rejects it out of hand without looking at the details and chooses one where Thanos is defeated with minimal deaths and Pepper and Tony get their happy end.</li><li>But Pepper is stubborn and even the few minutes in the park have been enough to let her see that Stephen\u2019s not in a good shape. Mentally or physically. So first she goes to rescue Tony only to find him in the middle of rescuing himself. They then work together to bring all the lost ones back - including a reluctant Stephen who tries to hide himself away after the dust (ha!) has settled.</li><li>Pepper is not satisfied with that. She gets the location of the Sanctum from Tony and goes over there to speak to Stephen. She almost wants to cry when she really sees the shaking ruin of Stephen\u2019s beautiful hands and doesn\u2019t leave until he has accepted a dinner invitation. She hugs him and doesn\u2019t want to let him go again.</li><li>Pepper\u2019s old feelings for Stephen reawaken. Tony beings to develop feelings for him. They begin to talk if it might be possible to add Stephen into their relationship. Pepper has always known that Stephen is bi and that Tony is exactly his type. Stephen is already so in love with both of them it hurts but much too afraid to even think about the possibilities. He doesn\u2019t want to \u201csteal\u201d one of them form the other and the thought of a triad doesn\u2019t really occur to him.<br></li><li>Pepper - with Tony\u2019s active encouragement - pursues Stephen and tries to rekindle the affair.</li><li>Tony and Stephen spend more and more time together and Tony tries to seduce Stephen.</li><li>Poor Stephen is confused as hell.
