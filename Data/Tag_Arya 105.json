        "text": "Yet after a while the motion of her horse became as soothing as the rocking of a cradle, and Arya found her eyes growing heavy. She let them close, just for an instant, then snapped them wide again. I can\u2019t go to sleep, she screamed at herself silently, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t. She knuckled at her eye and rubbed it hard to keep it open, clutching the reins tightly and kicking her mount to a canter. But neither she nor the horse could sustain the pace, and it was only a few moments before they fell back to a walk again, and a few more until her eyes closed a second time. This time they did not open quite so quickly.<br/>\nWhen they did, she found that her horse had come to a stop and was nibbling at a tuft of grass, while Gendry was shaking her arm. \u201cYou fell asleep,\u201d he told her.<br/>\n\u201cI was just resting my eyes.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYou were resting them a long while, then. Your horse was wandering in a circle, but it wasn\u2019t till she stopped that I realized you were sleeping. Hot Pie\u2019s just as bad, he rode into a tree limb and got knocked off, you should have heard him yell. Even that didn\u2019t wake you up. You need to stop and sleep.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI can keep going as long as you can.\u201d She yawned.\n&ldquo;Liar,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You keep going if you want to be stupid, but I&rsquo;m stopping. I&rsquo;ll take the first watch. You sleep.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;What about Hot Pie?&rdquo;\nGendry pointed. Hot Pie was already on the ground, curled up beneath his cloak on a bed of damp leaves and snoring softly. He had a big wedge of cheese in one fist, but it looked as though he had fallen asleep between bites.\nIt was no good arguing, Arya realized; Gendry had the right of it. The Mummers will need to sleep too, she told herself, hoping it was true. She was so weary it was a struggle even to get down from the saddle, but she remembered to hobble her horse before finding a place beneath a beech tree. The ground was hard and damp. She wondered how long it would be before she slept in a bed again, with hot food and a fire to warm her.",
