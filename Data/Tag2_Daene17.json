She had asked Aegon and you to go with her. You didn\u2019t want to at all but Aegon kept insisting to do so. All you wanted to do was leave now but he kept persisting to stay without no explanation. </p><p>The walk is anything but pleasant as you see the Dothraki rape and kill. Or steal things from the dead that are laying on the ground. This is why you didn\u2019t know why Daenerys had chosen to walk over here and not just stay with her husband. As you saw her reaction to all that was happening she looked anything but pleased. Sure this was totally different than when you lived in Dorne but you really didn\u2019t care for it. And even if you did care it wasn\u2019t in your position to stop any of them. But as you saw Aegon you knew he wasn\u2019t liking this at all. You knew he missed the peaceful ways things were back in Dorne as did you but being across the narrow sea was a duty something you needed to do. </p><p>As soon as Daenerys ordered the women that were locked up to be realsed Aegon was one of the first ones to help them out. He hated seeing them screaming or being hurt for no reason at all. You thought along with Ser Jorah thought it  was a bad idea to help them out but Daenerys insisted. You didn\u2019t like that Aegon put himself out like that. This could cause trouble with the Dothraki men but you also wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him even if you tried. </p><p>When you arrived where khal Drogo was he was already expecting Daenerys and the rest of you. Daenerys had saved the women and one of the women In particular was already someone\u2019s so when Daenerys had saved her along with the others let\u2019s just say that Mago was anything but pleased. You just watched them discuss with one another not even wanting to try to get in the middle of it. Mago had hated the idea of Daenerys commanding him so he wanted to fight Drogo but he was stupid to do so. You were pulled behind Aegon as he tried to protect you. But their was nothing to be protected from. Mago didn\u2019t last at all he was instantly killed he only managed to cut Drogo. The cut looked bad but it didn\u2019t matter to you or what the \u2018witch\u2019 did to help his cut. You knew it wasn\u2019t good idea for her to do so but Daenerys wouldn\u2019t listen to reason. </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>He sat by the fire lost in his own thoughts. Thinking of the same dreams he\u2019s been having for the past couple days now. He didn\u2019t know why he would dream it or why it seemed so real. He\u2019s tried to  just brush it off by saying it was just a dream but he was confused now. Having the same recurring dream was something that didn\u2019t happen to him before at all. But he also couldn\u2019t speak about it or ask questions because he knew their wouldn\u2019t be answers to them especially not with the Dothraki. But now he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Especially after he saw Khal Drogo getting hurt and the way he kept picking at his wound. He couldn\u2019t help but think of what had seen in his dream. The pyre.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always all alone why?\u201d He heard Doreah ask him as she sat down by him. It was something odd to see. Him alone. His sister was always by his side especially now that Viserys was gone. She was mostly always by his side. Except for now. And it seemed that everytime Doreah wanted to talk he was alone. Then again was it a coincidence? Probably not. </p><p>\u201cNot most of the times.\u201d He told her meeting her gaze. She only smiled sweetly over to him. </p><p>\u201cDo they call you the last dragon?\u201d She asked him scooting closer to him. He chuckled at her question. </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. A lot of the people didn\u2019t know I or my sister were even alive until we made our way across the narrow sea.\u201d He explained to her only making her more curious. </p><p>\u201cYou also have dragons blood in you?\u201d She asked him. </p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d He told her only causing her to smile and run her hand down his arm. </p><p>\u201cHave you seen one? A dragon I mean?\u201d She asked keeping her gaze on him. He looked over to her away from the fire. </p><p>\u201cOnly in my dreams.\u201d She giggles at his comment now putting both hands on his shoulders as she rested her Chin on top of them . </p><p>\u201cIve always wanted to see a dragon.\u201d she said to him almost in a childlike way. </p><p>\u201cWhy? Why a dragon?\u201d He asked her curiously. She took her hands away from her shoulders and looked down at the fire. </p><p>\u201cBecause they can fly. And where ever they are a few flaps of their wings and they\u2019re somewhere else. And they can kill.\u201d She said to him. Only making him think about the dragon eggs that are in his dreams even more. This conversation just made him think about the dream even more. As much as he tried ignoring it, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d He said and once again she looked over at him and placed her hands on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen many things throughout my life like a man change his face like one would with a change of clothes and I\u2019ve seen a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass an\u2014\u201d Aegon inturrupted her after he saw his sister. </p><p>\u201cCome on y/n join us. We\u2019re just telling stories.\u201d He told his sister. Once Doreah saw her stand not far away from them she pulled away and sat further away from Aegon. Y/N smiled and nodded her head in disagreement before she left for her tent. It was forced smile and her eyes told a different story. And Aegon knew it. He could practically feel her anger. He saw the way she looked at Doreah. And if looks could kill he knew she would be dead. But it\u2019s something only he could only notice about her. To anyone else it was just a sweet smile and a sweet look. But he knew that the fire in her violet eyes told something different. He excused himself and made his way to her. </p><p>- </p><p>(Y/N) </p><p>You went into your tent and made your way to your stuff that you had brought from home that was put away. You knew it exactly what you were looking for. A small vase that Ellaria had given you before you left Sunspear. It was a small vase but it was a deadly one. After you had seen Doreah flirting with Aegon you knew their was nothing else to do but use the vase on her and maybe even others. After you found the small bottle you heard footsteps approaching so you hid it and stood up and saw Aegon make his way into your tent. He had a greeter you with a small smile but you only met his smile with a burning glare. You took a few steps closer to where you stood. And you saw his eyes shift from you to the open chest. </p><p>\u201cLooking for something?\u201d He asked his smile dropping and his eyebrow raising. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked into your eyes as if looking for an answer. He placed his hand on yours that was hidden behind your back and pulled in gently in front of the both of you. </p><p>\u201cOpen your hand.\u201d He said his eyes still trained on your closed hand. You didn\u2019t listen and instead kept it closed as you looked up at him as if almost Challenging his gaze. He seemed that he didn\u2019t want to wait so moved your fingers that revealed the small vase. He snatched it from your hand and let your arm drop back to your side. He threw it to the ground making it shatter cross the floor. \u201cWere you really going to poison her?\u201d He asked you with a bit of annoyence hinted in his tone. </p><p>\u201cJust putting her and some others to sleep.\u201d You said to him with a smirk playing at your lips making your way past him but before you could he grabbed your arm. </p><p>\u201cYou find this entertaining?\u201d He asked and you rolled your eyes pulled your arm away from his grasp. </p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d You asked tilting your head a little and narrowing your eyes with the same smirk on your lips. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t play this little game with me now. She\u2019s innocent to any of your little jealous tactics you want to use on her.\u201d Your smirk disappeared now and was replaced by a serious look. </p><p>\u201cYou do see the way she looks at your right? She\u2019s practically undressing you with her eyes she wants to fuck you. Or you oblivious to it all?\u201d You asked as you placed your hand on your waist. He scoffed and looked down to the floor as he placed both hands on his sides and then dropped them to his sides. </p><p>\u201cYes I\u2019m not an idiot but do you see me acting on her advances?\u201d You didn\u2019t answer and instead crossed your arms on your chest as he looked at you meeting your gaze. \u201cNo I don\u2019t you know why?&hellip;. because I love you and there\u2019s no one else but you okay? I don\u2019t need anyone else but you. Only you.\u201d He placed his hands on your cheeks and pulled you closer to him. \u201cWe only have eachother remember.\u201d He rested his forehead on yours but you still weren\u2019t pleased. </p><p>\u201cWhat about the others? We can\u2019t let them be alive not unless you want a fight.\u201d He pulled away from you and now his soft look was replaced by an angered one. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you want them dead? There\u2019s no need for them to die.\u201d He said his voice rising. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said why already&hellip;.they\u2019re a threat.\u201d  You said your expression remaining the same. Annoyed and not pleased by his persistence on keeping them alive. </p><p>\u201cNo y/n they\u2019re not a threat. You just view them as one but they\u2019re not. You can\u2019t kill them they\u2019ve done nothing to you.\u201d He said his voice only seem to be raising more. You stayed quiet for a moment. Waiting for him to calm down. He ran his fingers through his hair pulling it back. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to kill them then we leave. We leave today. We can go build an army of our own. I\u2019m sure some of the lords in Westeros will ally with us and we can just buy armies here.\u201d You told him walking closer to him . You now were the one to place your hands on his cheeks. He looked down at the ground and then back to you. His gaze softening at your touch. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He whispered. </p><p>\u201cDo you not want it? Do you not\u2014-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d He Inturrpted only causing you to furrow your eyebrows in confusion. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d He asked again and you nodded. </p><p>\u201cYou know I do. You\u2019re the only person I trust here.\u201d You told him and he now placed his hands on your cheeks too. </p><p>\u201cThen trust me when I say that we have to stay here for now theirs something we need to do here with them.\u201d He said only getting you more confused. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSomething important and if for some reason it doesn\u2019t happen then&hellip;.you can do whatever you need to. Alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>Seeing the Khal fall from his horse only made Aegon more and more intrigued by his dream. It made his dream seem to become more realistic. He had gone in to be by his aunts side for support. But mainly it was just to see how he was doing and he saw that he was in a horrible shape. He was paler. He was covered in sweat and didn\u2019t even seem to be awake. He felt bad for his aunt Daenerys and felt bad for what she was going through but something inside him also wanted whatever his dream was to come true. </p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Aegon asked Ser Jorah as he came out of the tent. Jorah looked at him and nodded. </p><p>\u201cNot good. He might die later tonight.\u201d Jorah told Aegon as he followed Jorah somewhere. </p><p>\u201cMight? Is there still a chance he might live?\u201d Jorah stopped in tracks at Aegons questions. </p><p>\u201cDaenerys wants the witch that helped him with his wound to help him now.\u201d He said as he once again started walking to go find her. </p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Y/n asked as she walked by Ser Jorahs side. </p><p>\u201cNo But she\u2019s desperate&hellip;. you two might want to armor yourselves tonight and get your weapons.\u201d </p><p>After ser Jorah found the witch called Maegi she went into the tent with Daenerys. Aegon and y/n did as they were told. They didnt have armor mainly because they were both trained without it but they did have their weapons.</p><p>Aegon and the rest waited outside waiting for any news. It seemed that they had found a way to save him but they needed Drogos horse. And when that happened he knew nothing good was to follow. </p><p>And as everything happened he only thought that maybe their was going to be a chance for his dream to come true.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p>",

But he also couldn\u2019t speak about it or ask questions because he knew their wouldn\u2019t be answers to them especially not with the Dothraki. But now he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Especially after he saw Khal Drogo getting hurt and the way he kept picking at his wound. He couldn\u2019t help but think of what had seen in his dream. The pyre.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always all alone why?\u201d He heard Doreah ask him as she sat down by him. It was something odd to see. Him alone. His sister was always by his side especially now that Viserys was gone. She was mostly always by his side. Except for now. And it seemed that everytime Doreah wanted to talk he was alone. Then again was it a coincidence? Probably not. </p><p>\u201cNot most of the times.\u201d He told her meeting her gaze. She only smiled sweetly over to him. </p><p>\u201cDo they call you the last dragon?\u201d She asked him scooting closer to him. He chuckled at her question. </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. A lot of the people didn\u2019t know I or my sister were even alive until we made our way across the narrow sea.\u201d He explained to her only making her more curious. </p><p>\u201cYou also have dragons blood in you?\u201d She asked him. </p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d He told her only causing her to smile and run her hand down his arm. </p><p>\u201cHave you seen one? A dragon I mean?\u201d She asked keeping her gaze on him. He looked over to her away from the fire. </p><p>\u201cOnly in my dreams.\u201d She giggles at his comment now putting both hands on his shoulders as she rested her Chin on top of them . </p><p>\u201cIve always wanted to see a dragon.\u201d she said to him almost in a childlike way. </p><p>\u201cWhy? Why a dragon?\u201d He asked her curiously. She took her hands away from her shoulders and looked down at the fire. </p><p>\u201cBecause they can fly. And where ever they are a few flaps of their wings and they\u2019re somewhere else. And they can kill.\u201d She said to him. Only making him think about the dragon eggs that are in his dreams even more. This conversation just made him think about the dream even more. As much as he tried ignoring it, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d He said and once again she looked over at him and placed her hands on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen many things throughout my life like a man change his face like one would with a change of clothes and I\u2019ve seen a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass an\u2014\u201d Aegon inturrupted her after he saw his sister. </p><p>\u201cCome on y/n join us. We\u2019re just telling stories.\u201d He told his sister. Once Doreah saw her stand not far away from them she pulled away and sat further away from Aegon. Y/N smiled and nodded her head in disagreement before she left for her tent. It was forced smile and her eyes told a different story. And Aegon knew it. He could practically feel her anger. He saw the way she looked at Doreah. And if looks could kill he knew she would be dead. But it\u2019s something only he could only notice about her. To anyone else it was just a sweet smile and a sweet look. But he knew that the fire in her violet eyes told something different. He excused himself and made his way to her. </p><p>- </p><p>(Y/N) </p><p>You went into your tent and made your way to your stuff that you had brought from home that was put away. You knew it exactly what you were looking for. A small vase that Ellaria had given you before you left Sunspear. It was a small vase but it was a deadly one. After you had seen Doreah flirting with Aegon you knew their was nothing else to do but use the vase on her and maybe even others. After you found the small bottle you heard footsteps approaching so you hid it and stood up and saw Aegon make his way into your tent. He had a greeter you with a small smile but you only met his smile with a burning glare. You took a few steps closer to where you stood. And you saw his eyes shift from you to the open chest. </p><p>\u201cLooking for something?\u201d He asked his smile dropping and his eyebrow raising. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked into your eyes as if looking for an answer. He placed his hand on yours that was hidden behind your back and pulled in gently in front of the both of you. </p><p>\u201cOpen your hand.\u201d He said his eyes still trained on your closed hand. You didn\u2019t listen and instead kept it closed as you looked up at him as if almost Challenging his gaze. He seemed that he didn\u2019t want to wait so moved your fingers that revealed the small vase. He snatched it from your hand and let your arm drop back to your side. He threw it to the ground making it shatter cross the floor. \u201cWere you really going to poison her?\u201d He asked you with a bit of annoyence hinted in his tone. </p><p>\u201cJust putting her and some others to sleep.\u201d You said to him with a smirk playing at your lips making your way past him but before you could he grabbed your arm. </p><p>\u201cYou find this entertaining?\u201d He asked and you rolled your eyes pulled your arm away from his grasp. </p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d You asked tilting your head a little and narrowing your eyes with the same smirk on your lips. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t play this little game with me now. She\u2019s innocent to any of your little jealous tactics you want to use on her.\u201d Your smirk disappeared now and was replaced by a serious look. </p><p>\u201cYou do see the way she looks at your right? She\u2019s practically undressing you with her eyes she wants to fuck you. Or you oblivious to it all?\u201d You asked as you placed your hand on your waist. He scoffed and looked down to the floor as he placed both hands on his sides and then dropped them to his sides. </p><p>\u201cYes I\u2019m not an idiot but do you see me acting on her advances?\u201d You didn\u2019t answer and instead crossed your arms on your chest as he looked at you meeting your gaze. \u201cNo I don\u2019t you know why?\u2026. because I love you and there\u2019s no one else but you okay? I don\u2019t need anyone else but you. Only you.\u201d He placed his hands on your cheeks and pulled you closer to him. \u201cWe only have eachother remember.\u201d He rested his forehead on yours but you still weren\u2019t pleased. </p><p>\u201cWhat about the others? We can\u2019t let them be alive not unless you want a fight.\u201d He pulled away from you and now his soft look was replaced by an angered one. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you want them dead? There\u2019s no need for them to die.\u201d He said his voice rising. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said why already\u2026.they\u2019re a threat.\u201d  You said your expression remaining the same. Annoyed and not pleased by his persistence on keeping them alive. </p><p>\u201cNo y/n they\u2019re not a threat. You just view them as one but they\u2019re not. You can\u2019t kill them they\u2019ve done nothing to you.\u201d He said his voice only seem to be raising more. You stayed quiet for a moment. Waiting for him to calm down. He ran his fingers through his hair pulling it back. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to kill them then we leave. We leave today. We can go build an army of our own. I\u2019m sure some of the lords in Westeros will ally with us and we can just buy armies here.\u201d You told him walking closer to him . You now were the one to place your hands on his cheeks. He looked down at the ground and then back to you. His gaze softening at your touch. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He whispered. </p><p>\u201cDo you not want it? Do you not\u2014-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d He Inturrpted only causing you to furrow your eyebrows in confusion. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d He asked again and you nodded. </p><p>\u201cYou know I do. You\u2019re the only person I trust here.\u201d You told him and he now placed his hands on your cheeks too. </p><p>\u201cThen trust me when I say that we have to stay here for now theirs something we need to do here with them.\u201d He said only getting you more confused. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSomething important and if for some reason it doesn\u2019t happen then\u2026.you can do whatever you need to. Alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>Seeing the Khal fall from his horse only made Aegon more and more intrigued by his dream. It made his dream seem to become more realistic. He had gone in to be by his aunts side for support. But mainly it was just to see how he was doing and he saw that he was in a horrible shape. He was paler. He was covered in sweat and didn\u2019t even seem to be awake. He felt bad for his aunt Daenerys and felt bad for what she was going through but something inside him also wanted whatever his dream was to come true. </p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Aegon asked Ser Jorah as he came out of the tent. Jorah looked at him and nodded. </p><p>\u201cNot good. He might die later tonight.\u201d Jorah told Aegon as he followed Jorah somewhere. </p><p>\u201cMight? Is there still a chance he might live?\u201d Jorah stopped in tracks at Aegons questions. </p><p>\u201cDaenerys wants the witch that helped him with his wound to help him now.\u201d He said as he once again started walking to go find her. </p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Y/n asked as she walked by Ser Jorahs side. </p><p>\u201cNo But she\u2019s desperate\u2026. you two might want to armor yourselves tonight and get your weapons.\u201d </p><p>After ser Jorah found the witch called Maegi she went into the tent with Daenerys. Aegon and y/n did as they were told. They didnt have armor mainly because they were both trained without it but they did have their weapons.</p><p>Aegon and the rest waited outside waiting for any news. It seemed that they had found a way to save him but they needed Drogos horse. And when that happened he knew nothing good was to follow. </p><p>And as everything happened he only thought that maybe their was going to be a chance for his dream to come true.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",

She had asked Aegon and you to go with her. You didn\u2019t want to at all but Aegon kept insisting to do so. All you wanted to do was leave now but he kept persisting to stay without no explanation. </p><p>The walk is anything but pleasant as you see the Dothraki rape and kill. Or steal things from the dead that are laying on the ground. This is why you didn\u2019t know why Daenerys had chosen to walk over here and not just stay with her husband. As you saw her reaction to all that was happening she looked anything but pleased. Sure this was totally different than when you lived in Dorne but you really didn\u2019t care for it. And even if you did care it wasn\u2019t in your position to stop any of them. But as you saw Aegon you knew he wasn\u2019t liking this at all. You knew he missed the peaceful ways things were back in Dorne as did you but being across the narrow sea was a duty something you needed to do. </p><p>As soon as Daenerys ordered the women that were locked up to be realsed Aegon was one of the first ones to help them out. He hated seeing them screaming or being hurt for no reason at all. You thought along with Ser Jorah thought it  was a bad idea to help them out but Daenerys insisted. You didn\u2019t like that Aegon put himself out like that. This could cause trouble with the Dothraki men but you also wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him even if you tried. </p><p>When you arrived where khal Drogo was he was already expecting Daenerys and the rest of you. Daenerys had saved the women and one of the women In particular was already someone\u2019s so when Daenerys had saved her along with the others let\u2019s just say that Mago was anything but pleased. You just watched them discuss with one another not even wanting to try to get in the middle of it. Mago had hated the idea of Daenerys commanding him so he wanted to fight Drogo but he was stupid to do so. You were pulled behind Aegon as he tried to protect you. But their was nothing to be protected from. Mago didn\u2019t last at all he was instantly killed he only managed to cut Drogo. The cut looked bad but it didn\u2019t matter to you or what the \u2018witch\u2019 did to help his cut. You knew it wasn\u2019t good idea for her to do so but Daenerys wouldn\u2019t listen to reason. </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>He sat by the fire lost in his own thoughts. Thinking of the same dreams he\u2019s been having for the past couple days now. He didn\u2019t know why he would dream it or why it seemed so real. He\u2019s tried to  just brush it off by saying it was just a dream but he was confused now. Having the same recurring dream was something that didn\u2019t happen to him before at all.

Why a dragon?\u201d He asked her curiously. She took her hands away from her shoulders and looked down at the fire. </p><p>\u201cBecause they can fly.

We\u2019re just telling stories.\u201d He told his sister. Once Doreah saw her stand not far away from them she pulled away and sat further away from Aegon. Y/N smiled and nodded her head in disagreement before she left for her tent. It was forced smile and her eyes told a different story. And Aegon knew it. He could practically feel her anger. He saw the way she looked at Doreah. And if looks could kill he knew she would be dead. But it\u2019s something only he could only notice about her.

He looked down at the ground and then back to you. His gaze softening at your touch. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He whispered. </p><p>\u201cDo you not want it? Do you not\u2014-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d He Inturrpted only causing you to furrow your eyebrows in confusion. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d He asked again and you nodded. </p><p>\u201cYou know I do. You\u2019re the only person I trust here.\u201d You told him and he now placed his hands on your cheeks too. </p><p>\u201cThen trust me when I say that we have to stay here for now theirs something we need to do here with them.\u201d He said only getting you more confused. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSomething important and if for some reason it doesn\u2019t happen then\u2026.you can do whatever you need to. Alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>Seeing the Khal fall from his horse only made Aegon more and more intrigued by his dream. It made his dream seem to become more realistic. He had gone in to be by his aunts side for support. But mainly it was just to see how he was doing and he saw that he was in a horrible shape. He was paler. He was covered in sweat and didn\u2019t even seem to be awake. He felt bad for his aunt Daenerys and felt bad for what she was going through but something inside him also wanted whatever his dream was to come true. </p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Aegon asked Ser Jorah as he came out of the tent. Jorah looked at him and nodded. </p><p>\u201cNot good. He might die later tonight.\u201d Jorah told Aegon as he followed Jorah somewhere. </p><p>\u201cMight? Is there still a chance he might live?\u201d Jorah stopped in tracks at Aegons questions. </p><p>\u201cDaenerys wants the witch that helped him with his wound to help him now.\u201d He said as he once again started walking to go find her. </p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Y/n asked as she walked by Ser Jorahs side. </p><p>\u201cNo But she\u2019s desperate\u2026. you two might want to armor yourselves tonight and get your weapons.\u201d </p><p>After ser Jorah found the witch called Maegi she went into the tent with Daenerys. Aegon and y/n did as they were told. They didnt have armor mainly because they were both trained without it but they did have their weapons.</p><p>Aegon and the rest waited outside waiting for any news.

She had asked Aegon and you to go with her. You didn&rsquo;t want to at all but Aegon kept insisting to do so. All you wanted to do was leave now but he kept persisting to stay without no explanation. </p><p>The walk is anything but pleasant as you see the Dothraki rape and kill. Or steal things from the dead that are laying on the ground. This is why you didn&rsquo;t know why Daenerys had chosen to walk over here and not just stay with her husband. As you saw her reaction to all that was happening she looked anything but pleased. Sure this was totally different than when you lived in Dorne but you really didn&rsquo;t care for it. And even if you did care it wasn&rsquo;t in your position to stop any of them. But as you saw Aegon you knew he wasn&rsquo;t liking this at all. You knew he missed the peaceful ways things were back in Dorne as did you but being across the narrow sea was a duty something you needed to do. </p><p>As soon as Daenerys ordered the women that were locked up to be realsed Aegon was one of the first ones to help them out. He hated seeing them screaming or being hurt for no reason at all. You thought along with Ser Jorah thought it  was a bad idea to help them out but Daenerys insisted. You didn&rsquo;t like that Aegon put himself out like that. This could cause trouble with the Dothraki men but you also wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stop him even if you tried. </p><p>When you arrived where khal Drogo was he was already expecting Daenerys and the rest of you. Daenerys had saved the women and one of the women In particular was already someone&rsquo;s so when Daenerys had saved her along with the others let&rsquo;s just say that Mago was anything but pleased. You just watched them discuss with one another not even wanting to try to get in the middle of it. Mago had hated the idea of Daenerys commanding him so he wanted to fight Drogo but he was stupid to do so. You were pulled behind Aegon as he tried to protect you. But their was nothing to be protected from. Mago didn&rsquo;t last at all he was instantly killed he only managed to cut Drogo. The cut looked bad but it didn&rsquo;t matter to you or what the &lsquo;witch&rsquo; did to help his cut. You knew it wasn&rsquo;t good idea for her to do so but Daenerys wouldn&rsquo;t listen to reason. </p><p>-</p><p>(Aegon) </p><p>He sat by the fire lost in his own thoughts. Thinking of the same dreams he&rsquo;s been having for the past couple days now. He didn&rsquo;t know why he would dream it or why it seemed so real. He&rsquo;s tried to  just brush it off by saying it was just a dream but he was confused now. Having the same recurring dream was something that didn&rsquo;t happen to him before at all. But he also couldn&rsquo;t speak about it or ask questions because he knew their wouldn&rsquo;t be answers to them especially not with the Dothraki. But now he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. Especially after he saw Khal Drogo getting hurt and the way he kept picking at his wound. He couldn&rsquo;t help but think of what had seen in his dream. The pyre.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always all alone why?&rdquo; He heard Doreah ask him as she sat down by him. It was something odd to see. Him alone. His sister was always by his side especially now that Viserys was gone. She was mostly always by his side. Except for now. And it seemed that everytime Doreah wanted to talk he was alone. Then again was it a coincidence? Probably not. </p><p>&ldquo;Not most of the times.&rdquo; He told her meeting her gaze. She only smiled sweetly over to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Do they call you the last dragon?&rdquo; She asked him scooting closer to him. He chuckled at her question. </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know. A lot of the people didn&rsquo;t know I or my sister were even alive until we made our way across the narrow sea.&rdquo; He explained to her only making her more curious. </p><p>&ldquo;You also have dragons blood in you?&rdquo; She asked him. </p><p>&ldquo;I suppose.&rdquo; He told her only causing her to smile and run her hand down his arm. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen one? A dragon I mean?&rdquo; She asked keeping her gaze on him. He looked over to her away from the fire. </p><p>&ldquo;Only in my dreams.&rdquo; She giggles at his comment now putting both hands on his shoulders as she rested her Chin on top of them . </p><p>&ldquo;Ive always wanted to see a dragon.&rdquo; she said to him almost in a childlike way. </p><p>&ldquo;Why? Why a dragon?&rdquo; He asked her curiously. She took her hands away from her shoulders and looked down at the fire. </p><p>&ldquo;Because they can fly. And where ever they are a few flaps of their wings and they&rsquo;re somewhere else. And they can kill.&rdquo; She said to him. Only making him think about the dragon eggs that are in his dreams even more. This conversation just made him think about the dream even more. As much as he tried ignoring it, it seemed like he couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; He said and once again she looked over at him and placed her hands on her shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen many things throughout my life like a man change his face like one would with a change of clothes and I&rsquo;ve seen a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass an&mdash;&rdquo; Aegon inturrupted her after he saw his sister. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on y/n join us. We&rsquo;re just telling stories.&rdquo; He told his sister. Once Doreah saw her stand not far away from them she pulled away and sat further away from Aegon. Y/N smiled and nodded her head in disagreement before she left for her tent. It was forced smile and her eyes told a different story. And Aegon knew it. He could practically feel her anger. He saw the way she looked at Doreah. And if looks could kill he knew she would be dead. But it&rsquo;s something only he could only notice about her. To anyone else it was just a sweet smile and a sweet look. But he knew that the fire in her violet eyes told something different. He excused himself and made his way to her. </p><p>- </p><p>(Y/N) </p><p>You went into your tent and made your way to your stuff that you had brought from home that was put away. You knew it exactly what you were looking for. A small vase that Ellaria had given you before you left Sunspear. It was a small vase but it was a deadly one. After you had seen Doreah flirting with Aegon you knew their was nothing else to do but use the vase on her and maybe even others. After you found the small bottle you heard footsteps approaching so you hid it and stood up and saw Aegon make his way into your tent. He had a greeter you with a small smile but you only met his smile with a burning glare. You took a few steps closer to where you stood. And you saw his eyes shift from you to the open chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Looking for something?&rdquo; He asked his smile dropping and his eyebrow raising. </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He looked into your eyes as if looking for an answer. He placed his hand on yours that was hidden behind your back and pulled in gently in front of the both of you. </p><p>&ldquo;Open your hand.&rdquo; He said his eyes still trained on your closed hand. You didn&rsquo;t listen and instead kept it closed as you looked up at him as if almost Challenging his gaze. He seemed that he didn&rsquo;t want to wait so moved your fingers that revealed the small vase. He snatched it from your hand and let your arm drop back to your side. He threw it to the ground making it shatter cross the floor. &ldquo;Were you really going to poison her?&rdquo; He asked you with a bit of annoyence hinted in his tone. </p><p>&ldquo;Just putting her and some others to sleep.&rdquo; You said to him with a smirk playing at your lips making your way past him but before you could he grabbed your arm. </p><p>&ldquo;You find this entertaining?&rdquo; He asked and you rolled your eyes pulled your arm away from his grasp. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; You asked tilting your head a little and narrowing your eyes with the same smirk on your lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t play this little game with me now. She&rsquo;s innocent to any of your little jealous tactics you want to use on her.&rdquo; Your smirk disappeared now and was replaced by a serious look. </p><p>&ldquo;You do see the way she looks at your right? She&rsquo;s practically undressing you with her eyes she wants to fuck you. Or you oblivious to it all?&rdquo; You asked as you placed your hand on your waist. He scoffed and looked down to the floor as he placed both hands on his sides and then dropped them to his sides. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes I&rsquo;m not an idiot but do you see me acting on her advances?&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t answer and instead crossed your arms on your chest as he looked at you meeting your gaze. &ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t you know why?&hellip;. because I love you and there&rsquo;s no one else but you okay? I don&rsquo;t need anyone else but you. Only you.&rdquo; He placed his hands on your cheeks and pulled you closer to him. &ldquo;We only have eachother remember.&rdquo; He rested his forehead on yours but you still weren&rsquo;t pleased. </p><p>&ldquo;What about the others? We can&rsquo;t let them be alive not unless you want a fight.&rdquo; He pulled away from you and now his soft look was replaced by an angered one. </p><p>&ldquo;Why do you want them dead? There&rsquo;s no need for them to die.&rdquo; He said his voice rising. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said why already&hellip;.they&rsquo;re a threat.&rdquo;  You said your expression remaining the same. Annoyed and not pleased by his persistence on keeping them alive. </p><p>&ldquo;No y/n they&rsquo;re not a threat. You just view them as one but they&rsquo;re not. You can&rsquo;t kill them they&rsquo;ve done nothing to you.&rdquo; He said his voice only seem to be raising more. You stayed quiet for a moment. Waiting for him to calm down. He ran his fingers through his hair pulling it back. </p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want me to kill them then we leave. We leave today. We can go build an army of our own. I&rsquo;m sure some of the lords in Westeros will ally with us and we can just buy armies here.&rdquo; You told him walking closer to him . You now were the one to place your hands on his cheeks. He looked down at the ground and then back to you. His gaze softening at your touch. </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you not want it? Do you not&mdash;-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you trust me?&rdquo; He Inturrpted only causing you to furrow your eyebrows in confusion. &ldquo;Do you trust me?&rdquo; He asked again and you nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;You know I do. You&rsquo;re the only person I trust here.&rdquo; You told him and he now placed his hands on your cheeks too. </p><p>&ldquo;Then trust me when I say that we have to stay here for now theirs something we need to do here with them.&rdquo; He said only getting you more confused. </p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Something important and if for some reason it doesn&rsquo;t happen then&hellip;.you can do whatever you need to.

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",
