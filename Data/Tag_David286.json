Jenny stirs up emotions in him and all <i>she </i>wants is approval - a typical parent-child relationship.&rdquo;</p><p>Georgia spent five weeks filming in a factory near Cardiff with David Tennant and Catherine Tate, who plays Donna. &ldquo;Catherine was so hilarious and kept our spirits up in the freezing cold; and David is so normal and lovely that I was at ease right away.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>\n\nOther parts of this set: &nbsp;[<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/112322860650/behind-the-scenes-of-the-doctors-daughter-part\" target=\"_blank\">One</a>] &nbsp;[<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/114673899137/the-tenth-doctor-and-his-daughter-jenny-or-david\" target=\"_blank\">Two</a>]&nbsp; [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/175173731742/behind-the-scenes-of-the-doctors-daughter-part\" target=\"_blank\">Three</a>]<br />[ <a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/bts\" target=\"_blank\">Links to all Doctor Who Behind-the-Scenes sets</a> ]\n\n<br /></p>",

        "body": "<p>Last weekend I had the opportunity of a lifetime; a chance to meet my idol not once, not twice, but three times. I finally have the time and opportunity to sit down and write about my experience last weekend so I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I\u2019m sitting here looking at my pictures and yes, I am drinking my \u201cDavid Tennant in my Dreams\u201d tea from Adagio Teas. It\u2019s my process, don\u2019t judge me.</p><!-- more --><p>Anyone who knows me knows that I adore David Tennant. Many people have questioned my sanity as well as my life choices regarding this, but I do have my reasons. While David doesn\u2019t have the body of Chris Hemsworth, the dreamy sky-blue eyes of Tom Hiddleston, he does have magically majestic hair, deep soulful golden-brown eyes, a smile that lights up the darkest corners of the universe, and a very talented left eyebrow. David is also a talented actor and has an enormous range where he can play comedy, drama, and anything in between with equal ease. He has played a bouncing puppy-like world-class lover in \u201cCassanova\u201d, a grumpy disgruntled lethargic detective in \u201cBroadchurch\u201d, everyone\u2019s favorite Doctor in \u201cDoctor Who\u201d, and a truly evil narcissistic villain with no moral compass in \u201cJessica Jones\u201d. But the main reason I adore David Tennant is that even though he is a successful and brilliant actor, he is genuinely nice, and a very decent human being who treats his fans with respect and dignity and is truly a humble and gracious individual. If you have the opportunity to meet him, I highly suggest that you do. You will not regret it.</p><p>Believe it or not, I have tried to find anyone who has actually met or interacted with him, that either doesn\u2019t like him or has something negative to say about him. So far, the only negative thing I\u2019ve heard was from his co-star Freema Agyeman (Martha Jones) in Doctor Who that complained that David and John Barrowman had farting contests in the Tardis. In the grand scheme of things, while it\u2019s a little gross and juvenile, I don\u2019t find that to be overly bad. He is loved by all of his co-stars, his directors, and has been known to be a man with very little ego and very easy to work with.</p><p>It would take too much time for me to write down absolutely everything that happened at FanX (the official name of the Comic-Con I attended), especially if I went over every detail of each of the 3 times I met David, so instead, I will give you an overall experience of all encounters and highlights. I had a photo-op on Thursday, an autograph signing later that afternoon, another photo-op on Friday morning, and David\u2019s panel later that afternoon.</p><p>One of the best things about a Con is finding other people who share your passions for a particular fandom franchise. I was able to geek out about Star Wars, Firefly, Star Trek, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, and David Tennant (who has been in 3/5 of those fandoms). Most of Thursday was spent standing in line with other fans of David Tennant, and as much as I hate standing in line I really enjoyed talking to other people who loved him as much as I did. We swapped stories about how we discovered him, our favorite role he\u2019s played, and whether we\u2019ve met him before. We also swapped stories of our knowledge of him and his roles, what we adored about him, and what we were looking forward to when we met him. Half of the crowd dressed up in a variety of costumes from Doctor Who or other projects David has been in, and we acknowledged each other\u2019s efforts and creativity. It was a glorious validation of adoration for a skinny Scottish bloke. David\u2019s lines were the largest, most crowded, and most excited lines in the entire Con. There was also quite a bit of squealing (not from me) but from others.</p><p>If you\u2019ve read my dissertation about my first meeting with David, you\u2019ll remember me saying something about time being one of the most precious things an individual can share with you. I have met 4 celebrities in my life, 3 of them (David, Catherine Tate, and John Barrowman) were extremely rewarding and enjoyable because the celebrities actually focused time and energy (even though it was only for a few seconds) with me as an individual fan, the other celebrity just wasn\u2019t into it. There is a scene in \u201cGalaxy Quest\u201d where the actors of the show are at a Comic-Con and most of them are not happy to be there, just signing things in an assembly line, and ignoring their fans. There are some celebrities that do this, but David is not one of them.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"karthaeuser65:PfSWGYZ3sC0snYKjA6_sCw:ZjBuFj2HeF-FM\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9bd5f0658840023748f9f8d23edd714/tumblr_okcskiR1dA1uir9h7o2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"480\"/></figure><p>One of my favorite things that happened while waiting in line was being able to observe David interacting with other fans to see how he treated others. How a person treats others, especially when they think no one is watching, is a great barometer for who a person truly is. Here is what I observed: David treated every fan with the same dignity, graciousness, energy, and humility. EVERY \u2026 SINGLE\u2026 ONE!!! He did not give his fans a half-hearted cookie-cutter greeting, he gave each fan (or group of fans) an excited high-pitched individualized greeting that let them know that he was just as excited to meet them as we were to meet him. He looked everyone in the eye or at least tried to as some were reduced to hysterical giggling and couldn\u2019t bear to return his intense gaze. When it was your turn to be in his presence he was completely focused on you, even for the brief amount of time you had with him. If you made the attempt to interact with him, he made the effort to interact with you and did not let the handlers (employees at the Con whose job it is to move the crowd along) bully him or you. Every fan got their moment with David. He did not avoid contact with his fans especially in the photo booth; he shook hands, he put his arms around them, he held hands, he made funny faces and goofy poses, and genuinely looked like he was having a good time. He was game to do any crazy pose or situation as long as you requested it and it wasn\u2019t overly inappropriate. There were only two instances when I saw his countenance fall from his jovial demeanor; both times happened when he was not interacting with anyone directly and when he thought no one was looking. The fall in countenance was not necessarily a change in mood or demeanor but rather a relaxation or break in activity. He did not seem tired, angry, or upset it was simply a pause so he could take a deep breath and continue the energy. As an actor, he is trained to react, and nobody has better facial reactions than David Tennant. He rarely has a stoic expression (unless he\u2019s playing Detective Alec Hardy in Broadchurch), and the myriad of natural facial expressions that came across his face while dealing with several uncooperative pens was extremely entertaining. I wish I could have taken a video of it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"351\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"fiftysevenacademics:ghSKjX4U-3rBrh5wbBGa_Q:Zq51Fq29MdkNL\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83320066d6c2e66ed82f4d9662878ea7/tumblr_oae8wttFBX1skyln0o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"351\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>The Con was set up so that the celebrity guests could travel between the photo ops and autograph areas behind secured walls without having to interact or be seen by their adoring fans. David, however, chose to be seen and traveled between events amongst the unwashed masses. Other celebrities would come out behind the magic curtains and wave at their fans, but I don\u2019t remember seeing anyone traveling in the common area between events. If you\u2019ve ever watched him in Doctor Who or seen David move you know he tends to run and is very fast. I honestly believe David doesn\u2019t have a slow speed. The man is 6\u20191 with a 7ft stride and can cover great distances quickly, he is very fast. There is always a security detail around David because of his popularity, this detail is usually made up of handlers who may or may not know much about him and aren\u2019t exactly trained in security, they are simply human barriers to keep the fans from tackling David. I saw David, surrounded by about 6 individuals in FanX Security t-shirts traveling between venues and it was quite comical. The first time he was doing a slight jog, but moving briskly while the handlers were running to keep up with him. The second time he started off in a brisk walk that swiftly turned into a jog, that basically left the handlers scrambling behind him as they realized their charge had outrun them and he was left unprotected. As the crowd cheered, David smiled and waved acknowledging their adoration when he passed by.</p><p>My first interaction was a photo op. All I wanted in this photo was an opportunity to the nearest equivalent to a hug I could get. I wasn\u2019t nervous, but I was excited. When it was my turn, he looked me in the eye, smiled that glorious smile and gave me a very high pitched and excited \u201cHiiiiiiii, how are you?\u201d I honestly can\u2019t remember what I said or even if I responded coherently. He held his right arm out welcoming me to stand beside him and like a moth to a flame I snuggled up to his side. David takes thousands of pictures with his fans, smiling for most of them, and he has a fake smile that he uses to save his face from going into permanent paralysis and a genuine smile. Knowing this, I wanted to say something to him that would entice him to give me a real smile. I wrapped my arm around his tiny waist (to put things into perspective I have an 18-inch reach and my arm was slack with my hand on his waist), and he put his hand on my back. I squeezed just a little to see how huggable he was and I was not disappointed. For a skinny guy he is extremely huggable and cuddly and if you take a good look at both photos, he is leaning into me. Before the picture was snapped I said something to the effect of, \u201cI flew all the way from Alaska to see you on stage in London as Don Juan,\u201d or at least that is what I intended to say. I honestly believe he gave me a genuine smile because of it. After the camera flashed David turned to look down at me, I also think he even squatted a little to be more on my level, touched my right forearm as he very deftly moved me in front of him to escort me out of the booth and said, \u201cOh wow, thank you for coming so far, I really appreciate it.\u201d He was still looking me in the eye as I was excited and babbling something about it being the best experience and best performance I\u2019d ever seen. All of the above was only in the first encounter. The encounter lasted maybe 10 seconds but it\u2019s something I will never forget because he was kind, he was gracious, he was humble, and was genuine.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e7bfda2598724346bd7acc2d43ae903/tumblr_inline_pf2aky86p31sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>My second interaction was an autograph later that same day as the photo. I got in line an hour early for the very first autograph session at 4:30 but didn\u2019t get up to the front of the line until the 7:30 session. You could purchase a $100 autograph or you could purchase a customized autograph for $130 where he would personalize an autograph on something you brought, or on one of the stock photos available on the table. I brought one of my tickets from Don Juan for him to sign. For those who don\u2019t know how this works, when you buy your ticket for a personalized autograph you tell the person you buy your ticket from exactly what you want him to write on the item he is signing and they put it on a sticky so he can have the proper spelling and make the line go faster. I simply wanted him to dedicate it to me and sign his name. After the fact, I realized I could have had him write sooooo much more\u2026 maybe next time. My sticky note just said, \u201cTo Cindy\u201d. When it was my turn, he looked at the sticky note and very excitedly (and again high-pitched) said, \u201cCindy, Hi there.\u201d Hearing him say my name in his Scottish brogue and then look me in the eye was just unreal. I beamed like an idiot and reminded him again that I came from Alaska to see him on stage. While looking me in the eye he replied, \u201cOh, well thank you, I\u2019m so glad you came\u2026\u201d he looked at the tickets and continued, \u201cGreat seats too. Thank you for coming Cindy.\u201d I\u2019m sure I babbled something about how much I enjoyed it but I was only focused on what he was saying.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" data-orig-width=\"4032\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b24f7ed3a540463106e527f674e86154/tumblr_inline_pf2apnfOMZ1sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" data-orig-width=\"4032\"/></figure><p>I was a little disappointed in myself for not saying what I truly wanted to say to him but I knew my time was limited and I knew I wanted this experience to be positive for both of us, so I strictly kept to the topic of his stage appearance of Don Juan. What I wanted to tell him was that seeing him on stage in Don Juan in 2017 was the first time I had felt true joy since my mother and sister died in 2016. I wanted to thank him for giving me an opportunity to see him on stage and finally allowing myself to feel something other than despair. I also wanted to tell him how happy it would have made my mom to know that I got to meet him and to find out that he drinks Diet Dr. Pepper (which he happened to be drinking while signing autographs). I knew that if I even attempted to say anything like this I may not be able to hold my composure in his presence and I didn\u2019t want to be that fan that cried. I also knew it would dampen the jovial atmosphere that David tends to generate. Maybe someday when I have more confidence or time I will tell him. But for now, I was happy for what little interaction I had. He said my name twice, he looked me in the eye, he interacted with me as an individual and gave me a gorgeous smile. All in all, it was a great experience.</p><p>Thursday was really exhausting, and it was very hot at the Con. I had brought 2 Donna Noble related outfits to wear and had worn the first one on Thursday. The second one was the long gray dress-length shirt and purple cardigan with jeans from \u201cSilence in the Library\u201d. Because it was so hot and because my gray dress-length shirt was long enough, I decided to go as pants-less Donna (no mas pantalones). I wore a sign on my back that read \u201cDonna Temple Noble, Best Temp in Chiswick, Sometimes she forgets\u2026, If found, please return to: Wilfred Mott, Sylvia, The Doctor.\u201d I don\u2019t think David saw it but a few other people did and even recognized my costume. I even had one brave teenaged girl tap me on the shoulder and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this\u2026 but there\u2019s something on your back\u201d (this is a reference to a Doctor Who episode \u201cTurn Left\u201d not the sign on my back). It totally made my day and justified my costume choice. I also added an Alaskan element of a scarf of forget-me-nots, Alaska\u2019s state flower and something that is very integral to the storyline of Donna.</p><p>My third and final interaction with David was a photo op first thing Friday around noon. I knew I wanted a pose with my sonic screwdriver and this time I remembered to bring it in with me to the photo booth. When David saw me, he said \u201cHiiiiii\u201d again in a high pitched excited voice but this time it was slightly different. The way it was pitched indicated to me that he either recognized me from yesterday or recognized that I was attempting to dress as Donna Noble. I\u2019d like to think he recognized me from yesterday, so that is what I\u2019m going to assume. Again, he held out his arm to welcome me to stand beside him. I held out my extended sonic screwdriver to him and he took it looking me in the eye asking, \u201cOh, do you want me to hold it?\u201d I somehow blurted out the concept that I wanted us to hold it together, to which he very happily complied. He placed it in my hand and then wrapped his hand around mine, he then wrapped his arm around my shoulder and pulled me close to him. He was sooooooo close to me I could feel his body heat and when I realized I was close enough to kiss his neck I internally whimpered (at least I hope it was internal) and fought the urge to just nestle into the crook of his neck. You\u2019d think that a man that tall and skinny would be hard, stiff and immovable as a tree, but you\u2019d be wrong. He was soft, squeezable, and for the record, he snuggled into me, not that I was complaining by any means. My suspicions of him being a cuddler and a really good hugger are somewhat confirmed but I believe more research may be in order\u2026 for science. I don\u2019t remember if I said anything after the photo but I do remember him handing back my sonic screwdriver, looking me in the eye, smiling, and thanking me for coming.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c865e739b001ac5b617b1809afced954/tumblr_inline_pf2av6VW201sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>Seriously, how can anyone not love this man after an interaction like that???? Remember, he interacted with everyone he came into contact with, with the same enthusiasm, energy, humility, graciousness, and kindness. He is a human being worthy of the adoration and passion his fans give him. You cannot say that about all celebrities, but David is worthy of the time, effort, and money that so many people eagerly spend on him.</p><p>No, I did not have the forethought to smell him. I was too busy trying to remember to hold my stomach in, look him in the eye, breathe, and try not to say something stupid to remember to inhale his presence. After the pictures were taken I do remember feeling the sense that he probably smells of sunshine, joy, and the wishes made upon shooting stars. Sorry, I really wished I had taken a big whiff of his essence, but I do know he was very pleasant to be around. Maybe next time I will get to sniff him. Rest assured, there will be a next time.</p>",

There is a scene in \u201cGalaxy Quest\u201d where the actors of the show are at a Comic-Con and most of them are not happy to be there, just signing things in an assembly line, and ignoring their fans.

How a person treats others, especially when they think no one is watching, is a great barometer for who a person truly is. Here is what I observed: David treated every fan with the same dignity, graciousness, energy, and humility. EVERY \u2026 SINGLE\u2026 ONE!!! He did not give his fans a half-hearted cookie-cutter greeting, he gave each fan (or group of fans) an excited high-pitched individualized greeting that let them know that he was just as excited to meet them as we were to meet him. He looked everyone in the eye or at least tried to as some were reduced to hysterical giggling and couldn\u2019t bear to return his intense gaze.

There were only two instances when I saw his countenance fall from his jovial demeanor; both times happened when he was not interacting with anyone directly and when he thought no one was looking.

He rarely has a stoic expression (unless he\u2019s playing Detective Alec Hardy in Broadchurch), and the myriad of natural facial expressions that came across his face while dealing with several uncooperative pens was extremely entertaining. I wish I could have taken a video of it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"351\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"fiftysevenacademics:ghSKjX4U-3rBrh5wbBGa_Q:Zq51Fq29MdkNL\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83320066d6c2e66ed82f4d9662878ea7/tumblr_oae8wttFBX1skyln0o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"351\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>The Con was set up so that the celebrity guests could travel between the photo ops and autograph areas behind secured walls without having to interact or be seen by their adoring fans. David, however, chose to be seen and traveled between events amongst the unwashed masses. Other celebrities would come out behind the magic curtains and wave at their fans, but I don\u2019t remember seeing anyone traveling in the common area between events. If you\u2019ve ever watched him in Doctor Who or seen David move you know he tends to run and is very fast. I honestly believe David doesn\u2019t have a slow speed. The man is 6\u20191 with a 7ft stride and can cover great distances quickly, he is very fast. There is always a security detail around David because of his popularity, this detail is usually made up of handlers who may or may not know much about him and aren\u2019t exactly trained in security, they are simply human barriers to keep the fans from tackling David. I saw David, surrounded by about 6 individuals in FanX Security t-shirts traveling between venues and it was quite comical. The first time he was doing a slight jog, but moving briskly while the handlers were running to keep up with him. The second time he started off in a brisk walk that swiftly turned into a jog, that basically left the handlers scrambling behind him as they realized their charge had outrun them and he was left unprotected. As the crowd cheered, David smiled and waved acknowledging their adoration when he passed by.</p><p>My first interaction was a photo op. All I wanted in this photo was an opportunity to the nearest equivalent to a hug I could get. I wasn\u2019t nervous, but I was excited. When it was my turn, he looked me in the eye, smiled that glorious smile and gave me a very high pitched and excited \u201cHiiiiiiii, how are you?\u201d I honestly can\u2019t remember what I said or even if I responded coherently. He held his right arm out welcoming me to stand beside him and like a moth to a flame I snuggled up to his side. David takes thousands of pictures with his fans, smiling for most of them, and he has a fake smile that he uses to save his face from going into permanent paralysis and a genuine smile. Knowing this, I wanted to say something to him that would entice him to give me a real smile. I wrapped my arm around his tiny waist (to put things into perspective I have an 18-inch reach and my arm was slack with my hand on his waist), and he put his hand on my back. I squeezed just a little to see how huggable he was and I was not disappointed. For a skinny guy he is extremely huggable and cuddly and if you take a good look at both photos, he is leaning into me. Before the picture was snapped I said something to the effect of, \u201cI flew all the way from Alaska to see you on stage in London as Don Juan,\u201d or at least that is what I intended to say. I honestly believe he gave me a genuine smile because of it. After the camera flashed David turned to look down at me, I also think he even squatted a little to be more on my level, touched my right forearm as he very deftly moved me in front of him to escort me out of the booth and said, \u201cOh wow, thank you for coming so far, I really appreciate it.\u201d He was still looking me in the eye as I was excited and babbling something about it being the best experience and best performance I\u2019d ever seen. All of the above was only in the first encounter. The encounter lasted maybe 10 seconds but it\u2019s something I will never forget because he was kind, he was gracious, he was humble, and was genuine.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e7bfda2598724346bd7acc2d43ae903/tumblr_inline_pf2aky86p31sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"></figure><p>My second interaction was an autograph later that same day as the photo. I got in line an hour early for the very first autograph session at 4:30 but didn\u2019t get up to the front of the line until the 7:30 session. You could purchase a $100 autograph or you could purchase a customized autograph for $130 where he would personalize an autograph on something you brought, or on one of the stock photos available on the table. I brought one of my tickets from Don Juan for him to sign. For those who don\u2019t know how this works, when you buy your ticket for a personalized autograph you tell the person you buy your ticket from exactly what you want him to write on the item he is signing and they put it on a sticky so he can have the proper spelling and make the line go faster. I simply wanted him to dedicate it to me and sign his name. After the fact, I realized I could have had him write sooooo much more\u2026 maybe next time. My sticky note just said, \u201cTo Cindy\u201d. When it was my turn, he looked at the sticky note and very excitedly (and again high-pitched) said, \u201cCindy, Hi there.\u201d Hearing him say my name in his Scottish brogue and then look me in the eye was just unreal. I beamed like an idiot and reminded him again that I came from Alaska to see him on stage. While looking me in the eye he replied, \u201cOh, well thank you, I\u2019m so glad you came\u2026\u201d he looked at the tickets and continued, \u201cGreat seats too. Thank you for coming Cindy.\u201d I\u2019m sure I babbled something about how much I enjoyed it but I was only focused on what he was saying.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" data-orig-width=\"4032\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b24f7ed3a540463106e527f674e86154/tumblr_inline_pf2apnfOMZ1sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" data-orig-width=\"4032\"></figure><p>I was a little disappointed in myself for not saying what I truly wanted to say to him but I knew my time was limited and I knew I wanted this experience to be positive for both of us, so I strictly kept to the topic of his stage appearance of Don Juan. What I wanted to tell him was that seeing him on stage in Don Juan in 2017 was the first time I had felt true joy since my mother and sister died in 2016. I wanted to thank him for giving me an opportunity to see him on stage and finally allowing myself to feel something other than despair. I also wanted to tell him how happy it would have made my mom to know that I got to meet him and to find out that he drinks Diet Dr. Pepper (which he happened to be drinking while signing autographs). I knew that if I even attempted to say anything like this I may not be able to hold my composure in his presence and I didn\u2019t want to be that fan that cried. I also knew it would dampen the jovial atmosphere that David tends to generate. Maybe someday when I have more confidence or time I will tell him. But for now, I was happy for what little interaction I had. He said my name twice, he looked me in the eye, he interacted with me as an individual and gave me a gorgeous smile. All in all, it was a great experience.</p><p>Thursday was really exhausting, and it was very hot at the Con. I had brought 2 Donna Noble related outfits to wear and had worn the first one on Thursday. The second one was the long gray dress-length shirt and purple cardigan with jeans from \u201cSilence in the Library\u201d. Because it was so hot and because my gray dress-length shirt was long enough, I decided to go as pants-less Donna (no mas pantalones). I wore a sign on my back that read \u201cDonna Temple Noble, Best Temp in Chiswick, Sometimes she forgets\u2026, If found, please return to: Wilfred Mott, Sylvia, The Doctor.\u201d I don\u2019t think David saw it but a few other people did and even recognized my costume. I even had one brave teenaged girl tap me on the shoulder and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this\u2026 but there\u2019s something on your back\u201d (this is a reference to a Doctor Who episode \u201cTurn Left\u201d not the sign on my back). It totally made my day and justified my costume choice. I also added an Alaskan element of a scarf of forget-me-nots, Alaska\u2019s state flower and something that is very integral to the storyline of Donna.</p><p>My third and final interaction with David was a photo op first thing Friday around noon. I knew I wanted a pose with my sonic screwdriver and this time I remembered to bring it in with me to the photo booth. When David saw me, he said \u201cHiiiiii\u201d again in a high pitched excited voice but this time it was slightly different. The way it was pitched indicated to me that he either recognized me from yesterday or recognized that I was attempting to dress as Donna Noble. I\u2019d like to think he recognized me from yesterday, so that is what I\u2019m going to assume. Again, he held out his arm to welcome me to stand beside him. I held out my extended sonic screwdriver to him and he took it looking me in the eye asking, \u201cOh, do you want me to hold it?\u201d I somehow blurted out the concept that I wanted us to hold it together, to which he very happily complied. He placed it in my hand and then wrapped his hand around mine, he then wrapped his arm around my shoulder and pulled me close to him. He was sooooooo close to me I could feel his body heat and when I realized I was close enough to kiss his neck I internally whimpered (at least I hope it was internal) and fought the urge to just nestle into the crook of his neck. You\u2019d think that a man that tall and skinny would be hard, stiff and immovable as a tree, but you\u2019d be wrong. He was soft, squeezable, and for the record, he snuggled into me, not that I was complaining by any means. My suspicions of him being a cuddler and a really good hugger are somewhat confirmed but I believe more research may be in order\u2026 for science. I don\u2019t remember if I said anything after the photo but I do remember him handing back my sonic screwdriver, looking me in the eye, smiling, and thanking me for coming.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c865e739b001ac5b617b1809afced954/tumblr_inline_pf2av6VW201sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"></figure><p>Seriously, how can anyone not love this man after an interaction like that???? Remember, he interacted with everyone he came into contact with, with the same enthusiasm, energy, humility, graciousness, and kindness. He is a human being worthy of the adoration and passion his fans give him. You cannot say that about all celebrities, but David is worthy of the time, effort, and money that so many people eagerly spend on him.</p><p>No, I did not have the forethought to smell him. I was too busy trying to remember to hold my stomach in, look him in the eye, breathe, and try not to say something stupid to remember to inhale his presence. After the pictures were taken I do remember feeling the sense that he probably smells of sunshine, joy, and the wishes made upon shooting stars. Sorry, I really wished I had taken a big whiff of his essence, but I do know he was very pleasant to be around. Maybe next time I will get to sniff him. Rest assured, there will be a next time.</p>",

I finally have the time and opportunity to sit down and write about my experience last weekend so I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I\u2019m sitting here looking at my pictures and yes, I am drinking my \u201cDavid Tennant in my Dreams\u201d tea from Adagio Teas. It\u2019s my process, don\u2019t judge me.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Anyone who knows me knows that I adore David Tennant. Many people have questioned my sanity as well as my life choices regarding this, but I do have my reasons. While David doesn\u2019t have the body of Chris Hemsworth, the dreamy sky-blue eyes of Tom Hiddleston, he does have magically majestic hair, deep soulful golden-brown eyes, a smile that lights up the darkest corners of the universe, and a very talented left eyebrow. David is also a talented actor and has an enormous range where he can play comedy, drama, and anything in between with equal ease. He has played a bouncing puppy-like world-class lover in \u201cCassanova\u201d, a grumpy disgruntled lethargic detective in \u201cBroadchurch\u201d, everyone\u2019s favorite Doctor in \u201cDoctor Who\u201d, and a truly evil narcissistic villain with no moral compass in \u201cJessica Jones\u201d. But the main reason I adore David Tennant is that even though he is a successful and brilliant actor, he is genuinely nice, and a very decent human being who treats his fans with respect and dignity and is truly a humble and gracious individual. If you have the opportunity to meet him, I highly suggest that you do. You will not regret it.</p><p>Believe it or not, I have tried to find anyone who has actually met or interacted with him, that either doesn\u2019t like him or has something negative to say about him. So far, the only negative thing I\u2019ve heard was from his co-star Freema Agyeman (Martha Jones) in Doctor Who that complained that David and John Barrowman had farting contests in the Tardis. In the grand scheme of things, while it\u2019s a little gross and juvenile, I don\u2019t find that to be overly bad. He is loved by all of his co-stars, his directors, and has been known to be a man with very little ego and very easy to work with.</p><p>It would take too much time for me to write down absolutely everything that happened at FanX (the official name of the Comic-Con I attended), especially if I went over every detail of each of the 3 times I met David, so instead, I will give you an overall experience of all encounters and highlights.

There is always a security detail around David because of his popularity, this detail is usually made up of handlers who may or may not know much about him and aren\u2019t exactly trained in security, they are simply human barriers to keep the fans from tackling David. I saw David, surrounded by about 6 individuals in FanX Security t-shirts traveling between venues and it was quite comical. The first time he was doing a slight jog, but moving briskly while the handlers were running to keep up with him. The second time he started off in a brisk walk that swiftly turned into a jog, that basically left the handlers scrambling behind him as they realized their charge had outrun them and he was left unprotected. As the crowd cheered, David smiled and waved acknowledging their adoration when he passed by.</p><p>My first interaction was a photo op. All I wanted in this photo was an opportunity to the nearest equivalent to a hug I could get. I wasn\u2019t nervous, but I was excited. When it was my turn, he looked me in the eye, smiled that glorious smile and gave me a very high pitched and excited \u201cHiiiiiiii, how are you?\u201d I honestly can\u2019t remember what I said or even if I responded coherently. He held his right arm out welcoming me to stand beside him and like a moth to a flame I snuggled up to his side. David takes thousands of pictures with his fans, smiling for most of them, and he has a fake smile that he uses to save his face from going into permanent paralysis and a genuine smile. Knowing this, I wanted to say something to him that would entice him to give me a real smile. I wrapped my arm around his tiny waist (to put things into perspective I have an 18-inch reach and my arm was slack with my hand on his waist), and he put his hand on my back. I squeezed just a little to see how huggable he was and I was not disappointed. For a skinny guy he is extremely huggable and cuddly and if you take a good look at both photos, he is leaning into me. Before the picture was snapped I said something to the effect of, \u201cI flew all the way from Alaska to see you on stage in London as Don Juan,\u201d or at least that is what I intended to say. I honestly believe he gave me a genuine smile because of it. After the camera flashed David turned to look down at me, I also think he even squatted a little to be more on my level, touched my right forearm as he very deftly moved me in front of him to escort me out of the booth and said, \u201cOh wow, thank you for coming so far, I really appreciate it.\u201d He was still looking me in the eye as I was excited and babbling something about it being the best experience and best performance I\u2019d ever seen. All of the above was only in the first encounter. The encounter lasted maybe 10 seconds but it\u2019s something I will never forget because he was kind, he was gracious, he was humble, and was genuine.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e7bfda2598724346bd7acc2d43ae903/tumblr_inline_pf2aky86p31sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"></figure><p>My second interaction was an autograph later that same day as the photo. I got in line an hour early for the very first autograph session at 4:30 but didn\u2019t get up to the front of the line until the 7:30 session. You could purchase a $100 autograph or you could purchase a customized autograph for $130 where he would personalize an autograph on something you brought, or on one of the stock photos available on the table. I brought one of my tickets from Don Juan for him to sign. For those who don\u2019t know how this works, when you buy your ticket for a personalized autograph you tell the person you buy your ticket from exactly what you want him to write on the item he is signing and they put it on a sticky so he can have the proper spelling and make the line go faster. I simply wanted him to dedicate it to me and sign his name. After the fact, I realized I could have had him write sooooo much more\u2026 maybe next time. My sticky note just said, \u201cTo Cindy\u201d. When it was my turn, he looked at the sticky note and very excitedly (and again high-pitched) said, \u201cCindy, Hi there.\u201d Hearing him say my name in his Scottish brogue and then look me in the eye was just unreal. I beamed like an idiot and reminded him again that I came from Alaska to see him on stage. While looking me in the eye he replied, \u201cOh, well thank you, I\u2019m so glad you came\u2026\u201d he looked at the tickets and continued, \u201cGreat seats too. Thank you for coming Cindy.\u201d I\u2019m sure I babbled something about how much I enjoyed it but I was only focused on what he was saying.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" data-orig-width=\"4032\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b24f7ed3a540463106e527f674e86154/tumblr_inline_pf2apnfOMZ1sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" data-orig-width=\"4032\"></figure><p>I was a little disappointed in myself for not saying what I truly wanted to say to him but I knew my time was limited and I knew I wanted this experience to be positive for both of us, so I strictly kept to the topic of his stage appearance of Don Juan. What I wanted to tell him was that seeing him on stage in Don Juan in 2017 was the first time I had felt true joy since my mother and sister died in 2016. I wanted to thank him for giving me an opportunity to see him on stage and finally allowing myself to feel something other than despair. I also wanted to tell him how happy it would have made my mom to know that I got to meet him and to find out that he drinks Diet Dr. Pepper (which he happened to be drinking while signing autographs). I knew that if I even attempted to say anything like this I may not be able to hold my composure in his presence and I didn\u2019t want to be that fan that cried. I also knew it would dampen the jovial atmosphere that David tends to generate. Maybe someday when I have more confidence or time I will tell him. But for now, I was happy for what little interaction I had. He said my name twice, he looked me in the eye, he interacted with me as an individual and gave me a gorgeous smile. All in all, it was a great experience.</p><p>Thursday was really exhausting, and it was very hot at the Con. I had brought 2 Donna Noble related outfits to wear and had worn the first one on Thursday. The second one was the long gray dress-length shirt and purple cardigan with jeans from \u201cSilence in the Library\u201d. Because it was so hot and because my gray dress-length shirt was long enough, I decided to go as pants-less Donna (no mas pantalones). I wore a sign on my back that read \u201cDonna Temple Noble, Best Temp in Chiswick, Sometimes she forgets\u2026, If found, please return to: Wilfred Mott, Sylvia, The Doctor.\u201d I don\u2019t think David saw it but a few other people did and even recognized my costume. I even had one brave teenaged girl tap me on the shoulder and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this\u2026 but there\u2019s something on your back\u201d (this is a reference to a Doctor Who episode \u201cTurn Left\u201d not the sign on my back). It totally made my day and justified my costume choice. I also added an Alaskan element of a scarf of forget-me-nots, Alaska\u2019s state flower and something that is very integral to the storyline of Donna.</p><p>My third and final interaction with David was a photo op first thing Friday around noon. I knew I wanted a pose with my sonic screwdriver and this time I remembered to bring it in with me to the photo booth. When David saw me, he said \u201cHiiiiii\u201d again in a high pitched excited voice but this time it was slightly different. The way it was pitched indicated to me that he either recognized me from yesterday or recognized that I was attempting to dress as Donna Noble. I\u2019d like to think he recognized me from yesterday, so that is what I\u2019m going to assume. Again, he held out his arm to welcome me to stand beside him. I held out my extended sonic screwdriver to him and he took it looking me in the eye asking, \u201cOh, do you want me to hold it?\u201d I somehow blurted out the concept that I wanted us to hold it together, to which he very happily complied. He placed it in my hand and then wrapped his hand around mine, he then wrapped his arm around my shoulder and pulled me close to him. He was sooooooo close to me I could feel his body heat and when I realized I was close enough to kiss his neck I internally whimpered (at least I hope it was internal) and fought the urge to just nestle into the crook of his neck. You\u2019d think that a man that tall and skinny would be hard, stiff and immovable as a tree, but you\u2019d be wrong. He was soft, squeezable, and for the record, he snuggled into me, not that I was complaining by any means. My suspicions of him being a cuddler and a really good hugger are somewhat confirmed but I believe more research may be in order\u2026 for science. I don\u2019t remember if I said anything after the photo but I do remember him handing back my sonic screwdriver, looking me in the eye, smiling, and thanking me for coming.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c865e739b001ac5b617b1809afced954/tumblr_inline_pf2av6VW201sv56p4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"></figure><p>Seriously, how can anyone not love this man after an interaction like that???? Remember, he interacted with everyone he came into contact with, with the same enthusiasm, energy, humility, graciousness, and kindness. He is a human being worthy of the adoration and passion his fans give him. You cannot say that about all celebrities, but David is worthy of the time, effort, and money that so many people eagerly spend on him.</p><p>No, I did not have the forethought to smell him. I was too busy trying to remember to hold my stomach in, look him in the eye, breathe, and try not to say something stupid to remember to inhale his presence. After the pictures were taken I do remember feeling the sense that he probably smells of sunshine, joy, and the wishes made upon shooting stars. Sorry, I really wished I had taken a big whiff of his essence, but I do know he was very pleasant to be around. Maybe next time I will get to sniff him. Rest assured, there will be a next time.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Last weekend I had the opportunity of a lifetime; a chance to meet my idol not once, not twice, but three times. I finally have the time and opportunity to sit down and write about my experience last weekend so I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I&rsquo;m sitting here looking at my pictures and yes, I am drinking my &ldquo;David Tennant in my Dreams&rdquo; tea from Adagio Teas. It&rsquo;s my process, don&rsquo;t judge me.</p><p>Anyone who knows me knows that I adore David Tennant. Many people have questioned my sanity as well as my life choices regarding this, but I do have my reasons. While David doesn&rsquo;t have the body of Chris Hemsworth, the dreamy sky-blue eyes of Tom Hiddleston, he does have magically majestic hair, deep soulful golden-brown eyes, a smile that lights up the darkest corners of the universe, and a very talented left eyebrow. David is also a talented actor and has an enormous range where he can play comedy, drama, and anything in between with equal ease. He has played a bouncing puppy-like world-class lover in &ldquo;Cassanova&rdquo;, a grumpy disgruntled lethargic detective in &ldquo;Broadchurch&rdquo;, everyone&rsquo;s favorite Doctor in &ldquo;Doctor Who&rdquo;, and a truly evil narcissistic villain with no moral compass in &ldquo;Jessica Jones&rdquo;. But the main reason I adore David Tennant is that even though he is a successful and brilliant actor, he is genuinely nice, and a very decent human being who treats his fans with respect and dignity and is truly a humble and gracious individual. If you have the opportunity to meet him, I highly suggest that you do. You will not regret it.</p><p>Believe it or not, I have tried to find anyone who has actually met or interacted with him, that either doesn&rsquo;t like him or has something negative to say about him. So far, the only negative thing I&rsquo;ve heard was from his co-star Freema Agyeman (Martha Jones) in Doctor Who that complained that David and John Barrowman had farting contests in the Tardis. In the grand scheme of things, while it&rsquo;s a little gross and juvenile, I don&rsquo;t find that to be overly bad. He is loved by all of his co-stars, his directors, and has been known to be a man with very little ego and very easy to work with.</p><p>It would take too much time for me to write down absolutely everything that happened at FanX (the official name of the Comic-Con I attended), especially if I went over every detail of each of the 3 times I met David, so instead, I will give you an overall experience of all encounters and highlights. I had a photo-op on Thursday, an autograph signing later that afternoon, another photo-op on Friday morning, and David&rsquo;s panel later that afternoon.</p><p>One of the best things about a Con is finding other people who share your passions for a particular fandom franchise. I was able to geek out about Star Wars, Firefly, Star Trek, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, and David Tennant (who has been in 3/5 of those fandoms). Most of Thursday was spent standing in line with other fans of David Tennant, and as much as I hate standing in line I really enjoyed talking to other people who loved him as much as I did. We swapped stories about how we discovered him, our favorite role he&rsquo;s played, and whether we&rsquo;ve met him before. We also swapped stories of our knowledge of him and his roles, what we adored about him, and what we were looking forward to when we met him. Half of the crowd dressed up in a variety of costumes from Doctor Who or other projects David has been in, and we acknowledged each other&rsquo;s efforts and creativity. It was a glorious validation of adoration for a skinny Scottish bloke. David&rsquo;s lines were the largest, most crowded, and most excited lines in the entire Con. There was also quite a bit of squealing (not from me) but from others.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve read my dissertation about my first meeting with David, you&rsquo;ll remember me saying something about time being one of the most precious things an individual can share with you. I have met 4 celebrities in my life, 3 of them (David, Catherine Tate, and John Barrowman) were extremely rewarding and enjoyable because the celebrities actually focused time and energy (even though it was only for a few seconds) with me as an individual fan, the other celebrity just wasn&rsquo;t into it. There is a scene in &ldquo;Galaxy Quest&rdquo; where the actors of the show are at a Comic-Con and most of them are not happy to be there, just signing things in an assembly line, and ignoring their fans. There are some celebrities that do this, but David is not one of them.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>One of my favorite things that happened while waiting in line was being able to observe David interacting with other fans to see how he treated others. How a person treats others, especially when they think no one is watching, is a great barometer for who a person truly is. Here is what I observed: David treated every fan with the same dignity, graciousness, energy, and humility. EVERY &hellip; SINGLE&hellip; ONE!!! He did not give his fans a half-hearted cookie-cutter greeting, he gave each fan (or group of fans) an excited high-pitched individualized greeting that let them know that he was just as excited to meet them as we were to meet him. He looked everyone in the eye or at least tried to as some were reduced to hysterical giggling and couldn&rsquo;t bear to return his intense gaze. When it was your turn to be in his presence he was completely focused on you, even for the brief amount of time you had with him. If you made the attempt to interact with him, he made the effort to interact with you and did not let the handlers (employees at the Con whose job it is to move the crowd along) bully him or you. Every fan got their moment with David. He did not avoid contact with his fans especially in the photo booth; he shook hands, he put his arms around them, he held hands, he made funny faces and goofy poses, and genuinely looked like he was having a good time. He was game to do any crazy pose or situation as long as you requested it and it wasn&rsquo;t overly inappropriate. There were only two instances when I saw his countenance fall from his jovial demeanor; both times happened when he was not interacting with anyone directly and when he thought no one was looking. The fall in countenance was not necessarily a change in mood or demeanor but rather a relaxation or break in activity. He did not seem tired, angry, or upset it was simply a pause so he could take a deep breath and continue the energy. As an actor, he is trained to react, and nobody has better facial reactions than David Tennant. He rarely has a stoic expression (unless he&rsquo;s playing Detective Alec Hardy in Broadchurch), and the myriad of natural facial expressions that came across his face while dealing with several uncooperative pens was extremely entertaining. I wish I could have taken a video of it.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>The Con was set up so that the celebrity guests could travel between the photo ops and autograph areas behind secured walls without having to interact or be seen by their adoring fans. David, however, chose to be seen and traveled between events amongst the unwashed masses. Other celebrities would come out behind the magic curtains and wave at their fans, but I don&rsquo;t remember seeing anyone traveling in the common area between events. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched him in Doctor Who or seen David move you know he tends to run and is very fast. I honestly believe David doesn&rsquo;t have a slow speed. The man is 6&rsquo;1 with a 7ft stride and can cover great distances quickly, he is very fast. There is always a security detail around David because of his popularity, this detail is usually made up of handlers who may or may not know much about him and aren&rsquo;t exactly trained in security, they are simply human barriers to keep the fans from tackling David. I saw David, surrounded by about 6 individuals in FanX Security t-shirts traveling between venues and it was quite comical.

He held his right arm out welcoming me to stand beside him and like a moth to a flame I snuggled up to his side. David takes thousands of pictures with his fans, smiling for most of them, and he has a fake smile that he uses to save his face from going into permanent paralysis and a genuine smile.
