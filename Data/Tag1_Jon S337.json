Everything I do in this town is crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We want to come back to Westeros right. We need to be at least civil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get it. We need to do this right.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen, A.K.A Dany, sighs as she clenches the steering wheel. Music blasting, flooring the car, windows down Daenerys Targaryen speeds into her hometown, Westeros. Her best friend, Missandei, sits in the passenger seat with her arm out the window. They&rsquo;re driving in an old clean-cut black 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. It&rsquo;s been a whole year since they vanished with that car. No one in Westeros thought Daenerys or Missandei would ever come back. Hearing the music and the engine roar, the town realize they haven&rsquo;t seen the last of them. Dany drives into the parking lot of her family&rsquo;s diner, The DragonStone Diner. The diner&rsquo;s on the edge of the beach, it looks exactly the same as when they left. They were only 17 when they left, it was the end of their sophomore year at the time. The two girls get out of the car and into the hot summertime weather. While Missandei looks around their surroundings Daenerys stares at the family&rsquo;s restaurant in front of her. It feels like she never left a year ago just put everything on hold. Leaning on the car Missandei asks concerning as her best friend looks ready to start a war.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to come in with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Dany sighs as she looks down at her car keys before clenching them in her hand, &ldquo;This is between my brother and me.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls give each other one last look before Daenerys walks toward her family&rsquo;s Diner. Folding her arms Missandei stay by the car waiting. People on the sidewalk stop what they&rsquo;re doing at the sight of the two girls and the Mustang. No one in town has a car like that besides the Mad Mayor and only a year ago did his daughter drive away with it with her orphan friend. The hairs on everyone backs stand up since they all know where ever that mustang goes chaos follows. Seeing the locals in Westeros look her way in shock Daenerys smirks knowingly beneath her sunglasses as she gets closer to the front door. The bell jingles as Daenerys walks through the door followed by the click of her heels. Half of the customers in the diner are already staring at her from seeing in the parking lot and the other half just then turns to see her. There were a lot of locals and students from her old school, Seven Kingdom High, here. Looking around casually Daenerys takes off her sunglasses, the place looks just how she left it besides a new paint job. Walking toward the counter she notices the room has gone unbearable silent.</p><p>&ldquo;C-Can I help you?&rdquo; A waitress Dany doesn&rsquo;t recognize asks nervously from behind the counter, &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My brother.&rdquo; Daenerys sends her a bored look, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his office.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo; She smiles before walking toward her mother&rsquo;s old office, &ldquo;Thank-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You can&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo; The waitress then speaks up making Dany stop in place, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not my problem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; Dany points at the woman threateningly, &ldquo;If you tell me I can&rsquo;t see my brother in OUR diner one more time I will make sure you&rsquo;re the first that I fire.&rdquo;</p><p>The waitress doesn&rsquo;t dare say another word making Daenerys smile politely and continue walking. She doesn&rsquo;t look around the room but she knows everyone&rsquo;s staring at her. Going down a hall she sees a door cracked opened at the end. She can hear her big brother on the phone talking to someone in a commanding tone. They must be doing business. She&rsquo;s about to reach the door when she stops by the sight of a photo on the wall. It&rsquo;s a picture of her parents, her as a baby and Viserys as a child standing in front of the diner. They took that photo the day they bought the building, they were a family in that picture. Now, it&rsquo;s only her and Viserys. Turning back to the office door Dany walks the rest of the way and opens the door slowly. When she the door is completely open Viserys Targaryen glances up at the door while arguing with the person on the phone. He&rsquo;s about to look back down to his desk when he realizes who&rsquo;s at the threshold of the doorway. Looking at his little sister in pure shock he mumbles to the person on the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I&rsquo;m going to have to call you back later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, big brother.&rdquo; Daenerys smiles with a hidden motive in her eyes before shutting the door behind her, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A year\u2026 Give or take\u2026&rdquo; He puts the phone down and leans back in his chair, &ldquo;What are you doing back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know. Revenge, justice. The usual.&rdquo; She answers with a shrug of her shoulders while looking at what he has done to their mother&rsquo;s old office, &ldquo;More precisely\u2026 I&rsquo;m here to take back my life. Starting with what&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dany.&rdquo; Viserys chuckles while folding his arms, &ldquo;Nothing in Westeros is yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do tell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s house, his land, mother&rsquo;s diner, and their fortune is mine.&rdquo; Dany declares with no humor in her voice, &ldquo;Half of everything is mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father left everything in my name when he passed away.&rdquo;</p><p>Viserys smiles easily at her making her clench her fists while she walks around the office. Their father, the mayor, and mother got separated when she was a freshman in high school. Her mother disappeared to Essos leaving the kids with their father, they haven&rsquo;t heard from or seen her since. Not long after that their father went crazy and they had to put him in an asylum. The end of Dany&rsquo;s sophomore year is when he committed suicide in his room. Their father&rsquo;s will stated by a lawyer that Viserys got everything, the money, the land, the diner, and his sister. However, Dany found a loophole in the will while she disappeared for a year. It&rsquo;s said that once Daenerys is a legal adult everyone will be in her name as well as Viserys. Taking out a file from her purse Dany throws it down on the desk saying.</p><p>&ldquo;He did until yesterday\u2026 Do you remember what yesterday is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Your birthday\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Grinning she points at the file of papers she gave him, &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s will states I get half of everything he owned once I&rsquo;m legally an adult. Yesterday was my 18th birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>Unamused Viserys stares at his little sister tiredly before opening up the will she put in front of him. They each got a copy of it when he died, Viserys gave his to his lawyer, Daenerys didn&rsquo;t have a lawyer so she held onto it. As he reads the parts that are highlighted his expression becomes serious and concerning. This only makes Daenerys smile widen while plopping down on a chair in front of his desk. She studied this will since the day their father died, she knows it word for word. He begins to panic as he skims through the papers from realizing what she&rsquo;s saying is true. His lawyer never brought up that once she comes of age that she&rsquo;ll get half of everything. Putting the papers down and rubbing his face before asking quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;What have you been doing for the last year?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you ask.&rdquo; She smirks while taking her documents back, &ldquo;Well, after you kicked me out of the house with nothing. So I stole father&rsquo;s car, all his watches and decided to go to Essos with Missandei-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The orphan girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, a dragon. Yes, Missandei.&rdquo; Dany sends him a bored look before continuing, &ldquo;We decided to go to Essos and look for mother so this will would become irrelevant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t find her.&rdquo; She sighs hoping he doesn&rsquo;t see her disappointment, &ldquo;But I found a good lawyer. He gave me a loophole. My age, so I&rsquo;ve been waiting. For this day and here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want exactly, Daenerys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Half. Of everything. Half of this diner, half of his money, half of his land.&rdquo; She answers seriously before sitting up straight and spitting out in anger, &ldquo;This time you can&rsquo;t just kick me out either.&rdquo;</p><p>Her big and only brother stares at her trying to think of a way out of this. He wasn&rsquo;t prepared at all for this, he didn&rsquo;t think she would show her face in Westeros again. Not after all the pain, she endured in this town. After a month of the will being in effect, Viserys told Dany she had to move out. Viserys told the town it was because her behavior was similar to their crazy father. She stayed with Missandei in her dorm room at Seven Kingdom High for a few days trying to find a way around this. That&rsquo;s when Missandei came up with the idea to look for Dany&rsquo;s mother. Their parents never got legally divorced, so technically everything of her father&rsquo;s is her&rsquo;s still. No one knows where she went through which is why everything was given to Viserys. She also offered to go with Dany since the foster care told her that her parents are there too. So they left to Essos without telling anyone in fear of Viserys trying to sabotage them. The girls stole the car so they could drive to Essos and the priceless watches to live of off. Halfway through the year they still haven&rsquo;t found anyone they been searching for. However, their lawyer found a loophole. Her age. So they waited until she turned 18 to take back what&rsquo;s hers. One way or another she will get her half of her father&rsquo;s fortune.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is in my name now.&rdquo; Viserys sends her a poker face, &ldquo;Dad has nothing to his name now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See that&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; Leaning on the table smiling she points out, &ldquo;But my lawyer informed me that you would need another Targaryen to sign off on it. Mother&rsquo;s nowhere to be found, I didn&rsquo;t sign it and last I checked we were the last in the family with the name, Targaryen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did your research, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, I&rsquo;m not that little girl you kicked out a year ago. So this is how it&rsquo;s going to go down.&rdquo; Standing up Daenerys looks down at her brother with no room to argue, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to move back in, I&rsquo;m going to work here, you&rsquo;re going to call your lawyer and he&rsquo;s going to get us a co-owned document for the diner, the land, the money and the house that YOU will sign. My lawyer will be in town within a few days to finalize the document. If you argue with me about this or try anything, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to take this to court.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you disappeared for a year just to come back to get half of everything of Father&rsquo;s heritage?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long do you plan on staying in Westeros?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I plan to attend Seven Kingdom High for my senior year.&rdquo; Dany explains while folding her arms, &ldquo;So you aren&rsquo;t getting rid of me so soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really think that&rsquo;s a good idea?&rdquo; Viserys sends her a knowingly look, &ldquo;It may have been a year but Westeros still remembers all the damage you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want my life back.&rdquo; She spits out in anger, &ldquo;If a few locals look at me funny so be it but I will not leave Westeros just because of my past. Don&rsquo;t try me, brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. I get it. You&rsquo;re here to stay.&rdquo; Viserys sighs knowing his sister isn&rsquo;t going to back down, &ldquo;You can move back in and I&rsquo;ll get you your old job here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call up my lawyer tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, now keys.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys puts her hand out making Viserys roll his eyes and go into a draw. He pulls out a keychain with a handful of keys. Tossing them to her she catches them easily and inspects them. They are all new keys, she doesn&rsquo;t recognize any of them. One was even a button and she never had one like that before. Looking up as at Viserys he sighs knowing he&rsquo;s going have to explain which is which. Pointing at the key her brother speaks up and explains.</p><p>&ldquo;These are the keys for the front and back door of the diner, the front gate of our house, the front and back door of said house, and the garage door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, big brother.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany says too sweetly for his taste as she stands up. Viserys watching her jiggle the keys in her hands with an expression of terror, he feels like he just opened Hell. He should have known she&rsquo;ll be with fire in her eyes and the taste for revenge. Half their family dies and disappears, he then takes everything from her, forces her out of the house with nothing and makes the town believe she&rsquo;s a monster like their father. He was stupid to think she wouldn&rsquo;t come back. Looking at her now he knows she&rsquo;s changed since she took off to Essos. She wasn&rsquo;t someone he could push around for his benefit anymore. Sending her brother a look she walks toward the door and says one last thing.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. In the document&hellip;&rdquo; Dany speaks up sweetly while opening the door, &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s Mustang is under my name. Only.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Visery shrugs carefree before raising an eyebrow, &ldquo;I never wanted his car anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good to know.&rdquo; Smirking she walks out the door and says one last thing without looking his way, &ldquo;See you at dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>Slamming the door behind her she walks through the diner and out the door without looking anyone&rsquo;s way. She didn&rsquo;t care if the employees were listening to them or if the customers were sending her weird looks. Daenerys walks out of the diner as if she owned the place, which she will in time. Seeing Missandei still waiting beside the Mustang she lifts the keys and jiggles it. The sound makes both girls laugh in joy, their plan was slowly but surely working. Leaning off the car Missandei smirks while saying in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;That was quick. I thought he would put up a fight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did too.&rdquo; Daenerys thinks out loud while opening the driver&rsquo;s door and leaning on it, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hiding something. Dad must&rsquo;ve had more than just this diner for him to easy give me half of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else could your Dad have?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She sighs while looking around the diner, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to find out.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Reaching a neighborhood the Mad Mayor&rsquo;s daughter slows down looking for the place she used to call home. The Essos orphan looks around in shock, the street was filled with land and mansions, she forgot how rich the Targaryens were. Making a stop Danny checks the number beside the gate to make sure it was the right place since this was where they last lived at. It was the same place but it looks almost completely different. The gate is much bigger and elegant than the one she&rsquo;s used to, she notices in the corner is a security camera which wasn&rsquo;t there before. Getting closer to it she rolls down her windows and says into the speaker beside her car but really to herself.</p><p>&ldquo;How do I unlock my own damn gate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He gave you a key, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but to the actual gate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, state your name.&rdquo; Someone says through the speaker, &ldquo;And your business.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Daenerys Targaryen.&rdquo; She says awkwardly while sending Missandei a confused expression, &ldquo;Viserys sister. I kind of live here.&rdquo;</p><p>A camera next to the speaker turns on and faces Dany, for a moment the camera&rsquo;s light blinks. When it stops the gate opens up for her, they must have needed proof that it was her. Rolling up the window she starts driving down the road. Behind the gate are 25 acres of land owned by the Targaryens. At the back end of the acres is a small beach to the ocean and on one side is a forest. On the other is a small rocky hill. In the center of the land is her home, she remembered it being too small to be a mansion but too big to be an ordinary house. Looking at it now she realizes Visery made some big motivations to it. It&rsquo;s still a three-story house with a balcony, three cars garage, outdoor pool, but now there is so much more to it that she doesn&rsquo;t know about. Driving down the small road to the house she notices three Thoroughbred horses running alongside in empty fields. Her horses to be exact, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, two of them were dark brown and one is black as night. She thought Viserys would sell them once she left, they&rsquo;re worth good money. Slowing down Daenerys parks her car in front of her house gets out and slams the door behind her. Missandei the gets out and looks at the house in surprise before speaking to nobody in particular.</p><p>&ldquo;He did some remodeling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dany thinks out loud while walking off the road and onto the grass toward her three horses. They were the hardest things she had to leave behind. They all stopped sprinting and just jog between the trees that are on the edge of the forest. Watching her best friend Missandei goes around to the trunk she pops it open and grabs their bags before slamming it shut. The sound makes Drogon turn his head only to see her as he runs between the other horses. Seeing her gets him to lift his head up and neigh, Rhaegal and Viserion do the same immediately. Laughing softly she watches them running for a moment longer. Taking one last look she turns around to go to the front porch. She takes out her keys and unlocks the front door, it opens easy enough. Walking in slowly Missandei follows behind her with all the bags. Looking around the main room Daenerys breathes in heavily knowing she&rsquo;s finally back home. A lot of things look different but she sees a few things that are still the same. The oil painting of there family is still hanging up and table mother bought when they first got the house is still in the room with a bouquet of flowers. Missandei drops all their things and moves to stand by her best friend before asking softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than okay.&rdquo; She smiles with longing in her eyes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m finally taking back my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you still know your way around here-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Targaryen. Glad to see you&rsquo;re back in town.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls look away from each other when hearing a third voice come into the room. A man Dany has never seen walk in looking around his 40 or 50s. He has his left eye covered with a patch and he&rsquo;s wearing a clean-cut suit. He looks like he came right out of an FBI movie. He smiles at her politely with his hands behind his back. The girls look at one another confused before eyeing him. He must have been hired after she vanished because they never hired anyone for the house, they did everything themselves. When he reaches them he lifts his hand up for her to shake while introducing himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Beric Dondarrion. Your Butler, Security, and Housekeeper. Visery hired me half a year ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Danny.&rdquo; She shakes his hand slowly before nodding to her friend, &ldquo;This is Missandei. Were you the guy I heard on the speaker at the gate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma'am. Your brother made a few motivations while you were gone.&rdquo; He answers before grabbing their bags, &ldquo;No worries though. Your room is still the same as you left it. I&rsquo;ll give you the guest room beside her&rsquo;s Missandei. May I ask how long you will stay so I alert the rest of the staff?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rest of the staff?&rdquo; Missandei whispers to Dany but she just shrugs before answering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying permanently but Sandei is only staying a few days just until she gets her dorm room back at Seven Kingdom high.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He begins walking with their bags to the stairs with them following slowly behind, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll enroll you ladies into school tomorrow and make sure you get a room, Missandei. Would you like your old room back or a new one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did my brother hire you?&rdquo; Dany blurts out while they walk down the hall, &ldquo;No offense but we never needed a butler.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Visery became so busy with the Diner and everything your father pass down to him that he could take care of the house and land on his own.&rdquo; He explains when they reach two doors, &ldquo;So he hired me to take care of the house while his main focus is on the Diner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else did our father pass down to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It be better if you asked your brother himself.&rdquo; Beric suggests as he puts their things down, &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t informed me on anything other than the Diner, Land, House, and his father&rsquo;s politicians.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Politicians?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, here is your room Ms. Targaryen.&rdquo; He motions to the left door then adds, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the staff know you&rsquo;ll be staying in the guest room so they can stock it up with towels and other toiletries. If you need anything else there is an intercom in each room that was installed a few months back&rdquo;</p><p>With that said he nods at the girls before leaving them to themselves in the hall. Missandei raises an eyebrow at Dany causing her to frown knowing something seems off. They never had security before, even when their father was the Mayor they didn&rsquo;t have one. Plus, what did he mean by everything their father pass down to Visery? Was there more than what she was told? And what the hell was he talking about Politicians? Her brother was never into politics or so she thought. Picking up her bags she opens her door and tells Missandei.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to unpack and head to the stables after.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. I want to look around your house anyway before your brother gets home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p><p>They both go into their rooms and shut the door behind them. Instantly going into her room Daenerys realized he was right, Viserys didn&rsquo;t even touch her room while she was gone. Everything was still there and in the same spot. Everything just had a sheet on it so it would collect dust. Taking the sheet off her bed she drops her bag on it before taking the sheets of the rest of her things. When taking the sheet off her desk she sees the dozen of pictures from her sophomore year. One frame has her, Missandei, Grey Worm, Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont all together at the diner. Another has her and Arya and Sansa Stark at the homecoming dance. The third is her and Khal Drogo kissing on their six month anniversary. Picking that one up she looks at it for a second longer before throwing it across the room and hitting the wall. Never again, she thought. She&rsquo;ll let a man dictate her life like he did. Going over to the fallen picture she picks it up and sees it badly cracked. Smiling at it she throws it away before finally unpacking.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Hey. Baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys whispers as she walks up to her horse darker than night, Drogon. He was eating grass in the middle of a meadow near their house. The sun was setting and the staff was about to clean him off before going into the barn for the night. The other horses, Rhaegal and Viserion, were in the barn already cleaned by strangers who got hired after she vanished. When she visited them they were confused and frightened at first. After trying to calm them down they finally realized who she was. She isn&rsquo;t wearing anything she used to wear around them but her hair was still golden white as long as theirs which made them know it was her. Walking toward Drogon though he knew instantly who she is and started trotting toward her. Smiling at the sight of his tail swaying from side to side she says a little louder than before.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember me?&rdquo;</p><p>He comes up to her and snorts before sniffing her hair in the crook of her neck. Giggling she raises her hands to pet the side of his head. The wind picks up making both of their hair move wildly. She begins walking to pet his back he turns his head to watch her. Smiling softly she wraps her arms around him and leans her head on his back to hug him. Realizing she brought his favorite snack she pulls it out of her pocket. A peppermint, the sight makes him turn and eat it right out of her pam. Petting his mane she speaks up again as if he was a person.</p><p>&ldquo;My biggest regret was not bringing you guys with me.&rdquo;</p><p>He licks her hand even after he ate the peppermint.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise. It won&rsquo;t happen again. I&rsquo;m here to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>They begin walking beside one another with her hand on his back and his tail wagging as if he was a dog. Drogon was her first horse, her mother had given him to her as a birthday present when she was still with them. He was just a baby, she raised him into the horse he is now. She never had a staff to help take of him, it was all her. She cleaned him, took care of the barn, took him to the vet when sick. Same with Rhaegal and Viserion, her father gave her both of them one a few years later when they were babies as well. They were all races horses, breed to be in racing. She used to enter every horse race with Drogon, in school, and in State race. However, when her mother vanished all that stopped, she still took care of them but not race publically. It was always reminded her of her mother. This past year though, Dany finally came to terms that her mother isn&rsquo;t coming back and might as well be dead. So maybe it&rsquo;s time to get back into racing, it&rsquo;s the only thing she really knows how to do. They reach where the meadow turns into sand, the ocean is only a few yards away. Standing still while watching the small waves crash into the sand Daenery asks.</p><p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s time to get back into the game?&rdquo;</p><p>His only answer a little tug on her hair.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Dany! Check it out! You won&rsquo;t believe this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Daenerys speaks up throwing a few things into the trash, &ldquo;About the house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. About your childhood crush.&rdquo;</p><p>Missandei runs into her best friend&rsquo;s room in her pajamas. She plops onto her bed before taking out her phone. It&rsquo;s late at night and Viserys still hasn&rsquo;t come home yet. He still has an hour before Dany starting asking questions. When she got back from putting Drogon in the stables she started changing her room and throwing out things she didn&rsquo;t want or need anymore. Dany has been throwing out old clothes when she came in, trashing the last of her small clothes she goes to sit next to Missandei. She going through her phone until she gets on Twitter while explaining.</p><p>&ldquo;I finally got on my old Twitter and Snapchat since we&rsquo;re back and about to start school. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe what happened while we were gone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me guess Shae is still a whore?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but that&rsquo;s nothing new.&rdquo; Missandei thinks out loud while looking through Twitter, &ldquo;Bronn Stark got his GED, and his older brother Robb graduated last year. But what I wanted to tell you is that Daario Naharis is apparently single.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo;</p><p>Since Dany has met Daario Naharis she&rsquo;s had a huge crush on him but he always was talking to some girl. They were friends all in middle and high school but nothing more. She never really tried getting him since it would be competing with the other girls he was dating. If Sandei was right though, then she didn&rsquo;t have to compete with a girlfriend. Her best friend hands her the phone, it&rsquo;s on Daario Naharis Twitter profile. There&rsquo;s no girl&rsquo;s name in the bio or a date when he started dating someone and no girl in his head page. She goes to his photos and begins looking through them when she comes across a picture with someone else. Jon Snow, the bastard in the Stark family. Daario and Jon have their around each other&rsquo;s shoulder, they each have a beer in their free hand. The two are smiling big, it looks like they&rsquo;re at The Faceless Hub, it&rsquo;s a bar. He looks different from how she remembers him if it wasn&rsquo;t for his soft puppy eye she might not have even recognize him.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Ayra and Sansa bastard brother right?&rdquo; Dany asks Sandei while staring at the picture, &ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s still dating Ygritte.&rdquo;</p><p>Glancing at the picture of him one last time a memory of him flashes in her mind of who he used to be. He wore old looking shirts and ripped jeans back when she was in school with him, he must have changed after Sophomore year when she left. Jon&rsquo;s hair is now longer but still the same color with loose curls, it&rsquo;s in a man bun in the photo. He also has grown a short beard. His body is now rock hard in his tight plain black shirt and letterman&rsquo;s jacket. He&rsquo;s wearing dark blue jeans with black shoes. He has a silver chain around his neck but she can&rsquo;t see if he has a pendant on it or not. He looked good, she always thought he looked nice before but now he looks more like a man and less like a boy. Looking at the picture a few seconds longer a few memories of him and her cross her mind. Before she can too much at old memories and hands the phone back to Missandei and takes out her own. Sandei looks at the picture of Daario and Jon before smirking and sending Dany a look. She doesn&rsquo;t notice since she begins downloading her old social media apps back onto her phone making Sandei say innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;You should get back on Instagram\u2026 You might like what you see.&rdquo;</p>",

Let\u2019s not do anything crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Mad Mayor\u2019s daughter remember? Everything I do in this town is crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to come back to Westeros right. We need to be at least civil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. We need to do this right.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen, A.K.A Dany, sighs as she clenches the steering wheel. Music blasting, flooring the car, windows down Daenerys Targaryen speeds into her hometown, Westeros. Her best friend, Missandei, sits in the passenger seat with her arm out the window. They\u2019re driving in an old clean-cut black 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. It\u2019s been a whole year since they vanished with that car. No one in Westeros thought Daenerys or Missandei would ever come back. Hearing the music and the engine roar, the town realize they haven\u2019t seen the last of them. Dany drives into the parking lot of her family\u2019s diner, The DragonStone Diner. The diner\u2019s on the edge of the beach, it looks exactly the same as when they left. They were only 17 when they left, it was the end of their sophomore year at the time. The two girls get out of the car and into the hot summertime weather. While Missandei looks around their surroundings Daenerys stares at the family\u2019s restaurant in front of her. It feels like she never left a year ago just put everything on hold. Leaning on the car Missandei asks concerning as her best friend looks ready to start a war.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come in with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dany sighs as she looks down at her car keys before clenching them in her hand, \u201cThis is between my brother and me.\u201d</p><p>The girls give each other one last look before Daenerys walks toward her family\u2019s Diner. Folding her arms Missandei stay by the car waiting. People on the sidewalk stop what they\u2019re doing at the sight of the two girls and the Mustang. No one in town has a car like that besides the Mad Mayor and only a year ago did his daughter drive away with it with her orphan friend. The hairs on everyone backs stand up since they all know where ever that mustang goes chaos follows. Seeing the locals in Westeros look her way in shock Daenerys smirks knowingly beneath her sunglasses as she gets closer to the front door. The bell jingles as Daenerys walks through the door followed by the click of her heels. Half of the customers in the diner are already staring at her from seeing in the parking lot and the other half just then turns to see her. There were a lot of locals and students from her old school, Seven Kingdom High, here. Looking around casually Daenerys takes off her sunglasses, the place looks just how she left it besides a new paint job. Walking toward the counter she notices the room has gone unbearable silent.</p><p>\u201cC-Can I help you?\u201d A waitress Dany doesn\u2019t recognize asks nervously from behind the counter, \u201cMa'am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother.\u201d Daenerys sends her a bored look, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She smiles before walking toward her mother\u2019s old office, \u201cThank-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You can\u2019t go in.\u201d The waitress then speaks up making Dany stop in place, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m serious,\u201d Dany points at the woman threateningly, \u201cIf you tell me I can\u2019t see my brother in OUR diner one more time I will make sure you\u2019re the first that I fire.\u201d</p><p>The waitress doesn\u2019t dare say another word making Daenerys smile politely and continue walking. She doesn\u2019t look around the room but she knows everyone\u2019s staring at her. Going down a hall she sees a door cracked opened at the end. She can hear her big brother on the phone talking to someone in a commanding tone. They must be doing business. She\u2019s about to reach the door when she stops by the sight of a photo on the wall. It\u2019s a picture of her parents, her as a baby and Viserys as a child standing in front of the diner. They took that photo the day they bought the building, they were a family in that picture. Now, it\u2019s only her and Viserys. Turning back to the office door Dany walks the rest of the way and opens the door slowly. When she the door is completely open Viserys Targaryen glances up at the door while arguing with the person on the phone. He\u2019s about to look back down to his desk when he realizes who\u2019s at the threshold of the doorway. Looking at his little sister in pure shock he mumbles to the person on the phone.</p><p>\u201cI- I\u2019m going to have to call you back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, big brother.\u201d Daenerys smiles with a hidden motive in her eyes before shutting the door behind her, \u201cIt\u2019s been a good minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year\u2026 Give or take\u2026\u201d He puts the phone down and leans back in his chair, \u201cWhat are you doing back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Revenge, justice. The usual.\u201d She answers with a shrug of her shoulders while looking at what he has done to their mother\u2019s old office, \u201cMore precisely\u2026 I\u2019m here to take back my life. Starting with what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany.\u201d Viserys chuckles while folding his arms, \u201cNothing in Westeros is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather\u2019s house, his land, mother\u2019s diner, and their fortune is mine.\u201d Dany declares with no humor in her voice, \u201cHalf of everything is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather left everything in my name when he passed away.\u201d</p><p>Viserys smiles easily at her making her clench her fists while she walks around the office. Their father, the mayor, and mother got separated when she was a freshman in high school. Her mother disappeared to Essos leaving the kids with their father, they haven\u2019t heard from or seen her since. Not long after that their father went crazy and they had to put him in an asylum. The end of Dany\u2019s sophomore year is when he committed suicide in his room. Their father\u2019s will stated by a lawyer that Viserys got everything, the money, the land, the diner, and his sister. However, Dany found a loophole in the will while she disappeared for a year. It\u2019s said that once Daenerys is a legal adult everyone will be in her name as well as Viserys. Taking out a file from her purse Dany throws it down on the desk saying.</p><p>\u201cHe did until yesterday\u2026 Do you remember what yesterday is?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Your birthday\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Grinning she points at the file of papers she gave him, \u201cDad\u2019s will states I get half of everything he owned once I\u2019m legally an adult. Yesterday was my 18th birthday.\u201d</p><p>Unamused Viserys stares at his little sister tiredly before opening up the will she put in front of him. They each got a copy of it when he died, Viserys gave his to his lawyer, Daenerys didn\u2019t have a lawyer so she held onto it. As he reads the parts that are highlighted his expression becomes serious and concerning. This only makes Daenerys smile widen while plopping down on a chair in front of his desk. She studied this will since the day their father died, she knows it word for word. He begins to panic as he skims through the papers from realizing what she\u2019s saying is true. His lawyer never brought up that once she comes of age that she\u2019ll get half of everything. Putting the papers down and rubbing his face before asking quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing for the last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you ask.\u201d She smirks while taking her documents back, \u201cWell, after you kicked me out of the house with nothing. So I stole father\u2019s car, all his watches and decided to go to Essos with Missandei-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe orphan girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a dragon. Yes, Missandei.\u201d Dany sends him a bored look before continuing, \u201cWe decided to go to Essos and look for mother so this will would become irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t find her.\u201d She sighs hoping he doesn\u2019t see her disappointment, \u201cBut I found a good lawyer. He gave me a loophole. My age, so I\u2019ve been waiting. For this day and here it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want exactly, Daenerys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf. Of everything. Half of this diner, half of his money, half of his land.\u201d She answers seriously before sitting up straight and spitting out in anger, \u201cThis time you can\u2019t just kick me out either.\u201d</p><p>Her big and only brother stares at her trying to think of a way out of this. He wasn\u2019t prepared at all for this, he didn\u2019t think she would show her face in Westeros again. Not after all the pain, she endured in this town. After a month of the will being in effect, Viserys told Dany she had to move out. Viserys told the town it was because her behavior was similar to their crazy father. She stayed with Missandei in her dorm room at Seven Kingdom High for a few days trying to find a way around this. That\u2019s when Missandei came up with the idea to look for Dany\u2019s mother. Their parents never got legally divorced, so technically everything of her father\u2019s is her\u2019s still. No one knows where she went through which is why everything was given to Viserys. She also offered to go with Dany since the foster care told her that her parents are there too. So they left to Essos without telling anyone in fear of Viserys trying to sabotage them. The girls stole the car so they could drive to Essos and the priceless watches to live of off. Halfway through the year they still haven\u2019t found anyone they been searching for. However, their lawyer found a loophole. Her age. So they waited until she turned 18 to take back what\u2019s hers. One way or another she will get her half of her father\u2019s fortune.</p><p>\u201cEverything is in my name now.\u201d Viserys sends her a poker face, \u201cDad has nothing to his name now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Leaning on the table smiling she points out, \u201cBut my lawyer informed me that you would need another Targaryen to sign off on it. Mother\u2019s nowhere to be found, I didn\u2019t sign it and last I checked we were the last in the family with the name, Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did your research, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I\u2019m not that little girl you kicked out a year ago. So this is how it\u2019s going to go down.\u201d Standing up Daenerys looks down at her brother with no room to argue, \u201cI\u2019m going to move back in, I\u2019m going to work here, you\u2019re going to call your lawyer and he\u2019s going to get us a co-owned document for the diner, the land, the money and the house that YOU will sign. My lawyer will be in town within a few days to finalize the document. If you argue with me about this or try anything, I won\u2019t hesitate to take this to court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you disappeared for a year just to come back to get half of everything of Father\u2019s heritage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you plan on staying in Westeros?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I plan to attend Seven Kingdom High for my senior year.\u201d Dany explains while folding her arms, \u201cSo you aren\u2019t getting rid of me so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Viserys sends her a knowingly look, \u201cIt may have been a year but Westeros still remembers all the damage you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my life back.\u201d She spits out in anger, \u201cIf a few locals look at me funny so be it but I will not leave Westeros just because of my past. Don\u2019t try me, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I get it. You\u2019re here to stay.\u201d Viserys sighs knowing his sister isn\u2019t going to back down, \u201cYou can move back in and I\u2019ll get you your old job here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call up my lawyer tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, now keys.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys puts her hand out making Viserys roll his eyes and go into a draw. He pulls out a keychain with a handful of keys. Tossing them to her she catches them easily and inspects them. They are all new keys, she doesn\u2019t recognize any of them. One was even a button and she never had one like that before. Looking up as at Viserys he sighs knowing he\u2019s going have to explain which is which. Pointing at the key her brother speaks up and explains.</p><p>\u201cThese are the keys for the front and back door of the diner, the front gate of our house, the front and back door of said house, and the garage door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, big brother.\u201d</p><p>Dany says too sweetly for his taste as she stands up. Viserys watching her jiggle the keys in her hands with an expression of terror, he feels like he just opened Hell. He should have known she\u2019ll be with fire in her eyes and the taste for revenge. Half their family dies and disappears, he then takes everything from her, forces her out of the house with nothing and makes the town believe she\u2019s a monster like their father. He was stupid to think she wouldn\u2019t come back. Looking at her now he knows she\u2019s changed since she took off to Essos. She wasn\u2019t someone he could push around for his benefit anymore. Sending her brother a look she walks toward the door and says one last thing.</p><p>\u201cOh. In the document\u2026\u201d Dany speaks up sweetly while opening the door, \u201cDad\u2019s Mustang is under my name. Only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Visery shrugs carefree before raising an eyebrow, \u201cI never wanted his car anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Smirking she walks out the door and says one last thing without looking his way, \u201cSee you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Slamming the door behind her she walks through the diner and out the door without looking anyone\u2019s way. She didn\u2019t care if the employees were listening to them or if the customers were sending her weird looks. Daenerys walks out of the diner as if she owned the place, which she will in time. Seeing Missandei still waiting beside the Mustang she lifts the keys and jiggles it. The sound makes both girls laugh in joy, their plan was slowly but surely working. Leaning off the car Missandei smirks while saying in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThat was quick. I thought he would put up a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did too.\u201d Daenerys thinks out loud while opening the driver\u2019s door and leaning on it, \u201cHe\u2019s hiding something. Dad must\u2019ve had more than just this diner for him to easy give me half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else could your Dad have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighs while looking around the diner, \u201cBut I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d</p><hr><p>Reaching a neighborhood the Mad Mayor\u2019s daughter slows down looking for the place she used to call home. The Essos orphan looks around in shock, the street was filled with land and mansions, she forgot how rich the Targaryens were. Making a stop Danny checks the number beside the gate to make sure it was the right place since this was where they last lived at. It was the same place but it looks almost completely different. The gate is much bigger and elegant than the one she\u2019s used to, she notices in the corner is a security camera which wasn\u2019t there before. Getting closer to it she rolls down her windows and says into the speaker beside her car but really to herself.</p><p>\u201cHow do I unlock my own damn gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave you a key, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but to the actual gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, state your name.\u201d Someone says through the speaker, \u201cAnd your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaenerys Targaryen.\u201d She says awkwardly while sending Missandei a confused expression, \u201cViserys sister. I kind of live here.\u201d</p><p>A camera next to the speaker turns on and faces Dany, for a moment the camera\u2019s light blinks. When it stops the gate opens up for her, they must have needed proof that it was her. Rolling up the window she starts driving down the road. Behind the gate are 25 acres of land owned by the Targaryens. At the back end of the acres is a small beach to the ocean and on one side is a forest. On the other is a small rocky hill. In the center of the land is her home, she remembered it being too small to be a mansion but too big to be an ordinary house. Looking at it now she realizes Visery made some big motivations to it. It\u2019s still a three-story house with a balcony, three cars garage, outdoor pool, but now there is so much more to it that she doesn\u2019t know about. Driving down the small road to the house she notices three Thoroughbred horses running alongside in empty fields. Her horses to be exact, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, two of them were dark brown and one is black as night. She thought Viserys would sell them once she left, they\u2019re worth good money. Slowing down Daenerys parks her car in front of her house gets out and slams the door behind her. Missandei the gets out and looks at the house in surprise before speaking to nobody in particular.</p><p>\u201cHe did some remodeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dany thinks out loud while walking off the road and onto the grass toward her three horses. They were the hardest things she had to leave behind. They all stopped sprinting and just jog between the trees that are on the edge of the forest. Watching her best friend Missandei goes around to the trunk she pops it open and grabs their bags before slamming it shut. The sound makes Drogon turn his head only to see her as he runs between the other horses. Seeing her gets him to lift his head up and neigh, Rhaegal and Viserion do the same immediately. Laughing softly she watches them running for a moment longer. Taking one last look she turns around to go to the front porch. She takes out her keys and unlocks the front door, it opens easy enough. Walking in slowly Missandei follows behind her with all the bags. Looking around the main room Daenerys breathes in heavily knowing she\u2019s finally back home. A lot of things look different but she sees a few things that are still the same. The oil painting of there family is still hanging up and table mother bought when they first got the house is still in the room with a bouquet of flowers. Missandei drops all their things and moves to stand by her best friend before asking softly.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better than okay.\u201d She smiles with longing in her eyes, \u201cI\u2019m finally taking back my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still know your way around here-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Targaryen. Glad to see you\u2019re back in town.\u201d</p><p>The girls look away from each other when hearing a third voice come into the room. A man Dany has never seen walk in looking around his 40 or 50s. He has his left eye covered with a patch and he\u2019s wearing a clean-cut suit. He looks like he came right out of an FBI movie. He smiles at her politely with his hands behind his back. The girls look at one another confused before eyeing him. He must have been hired after she vanished because they never hired anyone for the house, they did everything themselves. When he reaches them he lifts his hand up for her to shake while introducing himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Beric Dondarrion. Your Butler, Security, and Housekeeper. Visery hired me half a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny.\u201d She shakes his hand slowly before nodding to her friend, \u201cThis is Missandei. Were you the guy I heard on the speaker at the gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ma'am. Your brother made a few motivations while you were gone.\u201d He answers before grabbing their bags, \u201cNo worries though. Your room is still the same as you left it. I\u2019ll give you the guest room beside her\u2019s Missandei. May I ask how long you will stay so I alert the rest of the staff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest of the staff?\u201d Missandei whispers to Dany but she just shrugs before answering, \u201cI\u2019m staying permanently but Sandei is only staying a few days just until she gets her dorm room back at Seven Kingdom high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He begins walking with their bags to the stairs with them following slowly behind, \u201cI\u2019ll enroll you ladies into school tomorrow and make sure you get a room, Missandei. Would you like your old room back or a new one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did my brother hire you?\u201d Dany blurts out while they walk down the hall, \u201cNo offense but we never needed a butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisery became so busy with the Diner and everything your father pass down to him that he could take care of the house and land on his own.\u201d He explains when they reach two doors, \u201cSo he hired me to take care of the house while his main focus is on the Diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did our father pass down to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt be better if you asked your brother himself.\u201d Beric suggests as he puts their things down, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t informed me on anything other than the Diner, Land, House, and his father\u2019s politicians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoliticians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here is your room Ms. Targaryen.\u201d He motions to the left door then adds, \u201cI\u2019ll let the staff know you\u2019ll be staying in the guest room so they can stock it up with towels and other toiletries. If you need anything else there is an intercom in each room that was installed a few months back\u201d</p><p>With that said he nods at the girls before leaving them to themselves in the hall. Missandei raises an eyebrow at Dany causing her to frown knowing something seems off. They never had security before, even when their father was the Mayor they didn\u2019t have one. Plus, what did he mean by everything their father pass down to Visery? Was there more than what she was told? And what the hell was he talking about Politicians? Her brother was never into politics or so she thought. Picking up her bags she opens her door and tells Missandei.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to unpack and head to the stables after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I want to look around your house anyway before your brother gets home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>They both go into their rooms and shut the door behind them. Instantly going into her room Daenerys realized he was right, Viserys didn\u2019t even touch her room while she was gone. Everything was still there and in the same spot. Everything just had a sheet on it so it would collect dust. Taking the sheet off her bed she drops her bag on it before taking the sheets of the rest of her things. When taking the sheet off her desk she sees the dozen of pictures from her sophomore year. One frame has her, Missandei, Grey Worm, Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont all together at the diner. Another has her and Arya and Sansa Stark at the homecoming dance. The third is her and Khal Drogo kissing on their six month anniversary. Picking that one up she looks at it for a second longer before throwing it across the room and hitting the wall. Never again, she thought. She\u2019ll let a man dictate her life like he did. Going over to the fallen picture she picks it up and sees it badly cracked. Smiling at it she throws it away before finally unpacking.</p><hr><p>\u201cHey. Baby.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys whispers as she walks up to her horse darker than night, Drogon. He was eating grass in the middle of a meadow near their house. The sun was setting and the staff was about to clean him off before going into the barn for the night. The other horses, Rhaegal and Viserion, were in the barn already cleaned by strangers who got hired after she vanished. When she visited them they were confused and frightened at first. After trying to calm them down they finally realized who she was. She isn\u2019t wearing anything she used to wear around them but her hair was still golden white as long as theirs which made them know it was her. Walking toward Drogon though he knew instantly who she is and started trotting toward her. Smiling at the sight of his tail swaying from side to side she says a little louder than before.</p><p>\u201cRemember me?\u201d</p><p>He comes up to her and snorts before sniffing her hair in the crook of her neck. Giggling she raises her hands to pet the side of his head. The wind picks up making both of their hair move wildly. She begins walking to pet his back he turns his head to watch her. Smiling softly she wraps her arms around him and leans her head on his back to hug him. Realizing she brought his favorite snack she pulls it out of her pocket. A peppermint, the sight makes him turn and eat it right out of her pam. Petting his mane she speaks up again as if he was a person.</p><p>\u201cMy biggest regret was not bringing you guys with me.\u201d</p><p>He licks her hand even after he ate the peppermint.</p><p>\u201cI promise. It won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m here to stay.\u201d</p><p>They begin walking beside one another with her hand on his back and his tail wagging as if he was a dog. Drogon was her first horse, her mother had given him to her as a birthday present when she was still with them. He was just a baby, she raised him into the horse he is now. She never had a staff to help take of him, it was all her. She cleaned him, took care of the barn, took him to the vet when sick. Same with Rhaegal and Viserion, her father gave her both of them one a few years later when they were babies as well. They were all races horses, breed to be in racing. She used to enter every horse race with Drogon, in school, and in State race. However, when her mother vanished all that stopped, she still took care of them but not race publically. It was always reminded her of her mother. This past year though, Dany finally came to terms that her mother isn\u2019t coming back and might as well be dead. So maybe it\u2019s time to get back into racing, it\u2019s the only thing she really knows how to do. They reach where the meadow turns into sand, the ocean is only a few yards away. Standing still while watching the small waves crash into the sand Daenery asks.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s time to get back into the game?\u201d</p><p>His only answer a little tug on her hair.</p><hr><p>\u201cDany! Check it out! You won\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daenerys speaks up throwing a few things into the trash, \u201cAbout the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. About your childhood crush.\u201d</p><p>Missandei runs into her best friend\u2019s room in her pajamas. She plops onto her bed before taking out her phone. It\u2019s late at night and Viserys still hasn\u2019t come home yet. He still has an hour before Dany starting asking questions. When she got back from putting Drogon in the stables she started changing her room and throwing out things she didn\u2019t want or need anymore. Dany has been throwing out old clothes when she came in, trashing the last of her small clothes she goes to sit next to Missandei. She going through her phone until she gets on Twitter while explaining.</p><p>\u201cI finally got on my old Twitter and Snapchat since we\u2019re back and about to start school. You wouldn\u2019t believe what happened while we were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess Shae is still a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d Missandei thinks out loud while looking through Twitter, \u201cBronn Stark got his GED, and his older brother Robb graduated last year. But what I wanted to tell you is that Daario Naharis is apparently single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d</p><p>Since Dany has met Daario Naharis she\u2019s had a huge crush on him but he always was talking to some girl. They were friends all in middle and high school but nothing more. She never really tried getting him since it would be competing with the other girls he was dating. If Sandei was right though, then she didn\u2019t have to compete with a girlfriend. Her best friend hands her the phone, it\u2019s on Daario Naharis Twitter profile. There\u2019s no girl\u2019s name in the bio or a date when he started dating someone and no girl in his head page. She goes to his photos and begins looking through them when she comes across a picture with someone else. Jon Snow, the bastard in the Stark family. Daario and Jon have their around each other\u2019s shoulder, they each have a beer in their free hand. The two are smiling big, it looks like they\u2019re at The Faceless Hub, it\u2019s a bar. He looks different from how she remembers him if it wasn\u2019t for his soft puppy eye she might not have even recognize him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ayra and Sansa bastard brother right?\u201d Dany asks Sandei while staring at the picture, \u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still dating Ygritte.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at the picture of him one last time a memory of him flashes in her mind of who he used to be. He wore old looking shirts and ripped jeans back when she was in school with him, he must have changed after Sophomore year when she left. Jon\u2019s hair is now longer but still the same color with loose curls, it\u2019s in a man bun in the photo. He also has grown a short beard. His body is now rock hard in his tight plain black shirt and letterman\u2019s jacket. He\u2019s wearing dark blue jeans with black shoes. He has a silver chain around his neck but she can\u2019t see if he has a pendant on it or not. He looked good, she always thought he looked nice before but now he looks more like a man and less like a boy. Looking at the picture a few seconds longer a few memories of him and her cross her mind. Before she can too much at old memories and hands the phone back to Missandei and takes out her own. Sandei looks at the picture of Daario and Jon before smirking and sending Dany a look. She doesn\u2019t notice since she begins downloading her old social media apps back onto her phone making Sandei say innocently.</p><p>\u201cYou should get back on Instagram\u2026 You might like what you see.\u201d</p></p>",

We need to be at least civil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. We need to do this right.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen, A.K.A Dany, sighs as she clenches the steering wheel. Music blasting, flooring the car, windows down Daenerys Targaryen speeds into her hometown, Westeros. Her best friend, Missandei, sits in the passenger seat with her arm out the window. They\u2019re driving in an old clean-cut black 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. It\u2019s been a whole year since they vanished with that car. No one in Westeros thought Daenerys or Missandei would ever come back. Hearing the music and the engine roar, the town realize they haven\u2019t seen the last of them. Dany drives into the parking lot of her family\u2019s diner, The DragonStone Diner. The diner\u2019s on the edge of the beach, it looks exactly the same as when they left. They were only 17 when they left, it was the end of their sophomore year at the time. The two girls get out of the car and into the hot summertime weather. While Missandei looks around their surroundings Daenerys stares at the family\u2019s restaurant in front of her. It feels like she never left a year ago just put everything on hold. Leaning on the car Missandei asks concerning as her best friend looks ready to start a war.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come in with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dany sighs as she looks down at her car keys before clenching them in her hand, \u201cThis is between my brother and me.\u201d</p><p>The girls give each other one last look before Daenerys walks toward her family\u2019s Diner. Folding her arms Missandei stay by the car waiting. People on the sidewalk stop what they\u2019re doing at the sight of the two girls and the Mustang. No one in town has a car like that besides the Mad Mayor and only a year ago did his daughter drive away with it with her orphan friend. The hairs on everyone backs stand up since they all know where ever that mustang goes chaos follows. Seeing the locals in Westeros look her way in shock Daenerys smirks knowingly beneath her sunglasses as she gets closer to the front door. The bell jingles as Daenerys walks through the door followed by the click of her heels. Half of the customers in the diner are already staring at her from seeing in the parking lot and the other half just then turns to see her. There were a lot of locals and students from her old school, Seven Kingdom High, here. Looking around casually Daenerys takes off her sunglasses, the place looks just how she left it besides a new paint job. Walking toward the counter she notices the room has gone unbearable silent.</p><p>\u201cC-Can I help you?\u201d A waitress Dany doesn\u2019t recognize asks nervously from behind the counter, \u201cMa'am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother.\u201d Daenerys sends her a bored look, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She smiles before walking toward her mother\u2019s old office, \u201cThank-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You can\u2019t go in.\u201d The waitress then speaks up making Dany stop in place, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m serious,\u201d Dany points at the woman threateningly, \u201cIf you tell me I can\u2019t see my brother in OUR diner one more time I will make sure you\u2019re the first that I fire.\u201d</p><p>The waitress doesn\u2019t dare say another word making Daenerys smile politely and continue walking. She doesn\u2019t look around the room but she knows everyone\u2019s staring at her. Going down a hall she sees a door cracked opened at the end. She can hear her big brother on the phone talking to someone in a commanding tone. They must be doing business. She\u2019s about to reach the door when she stops by the sight of a photo on the wall. It\u2019s a picture of her parents, her as a baby and Viserys as a child standing in front of the diner. They took that photo the day they bought the building, they were a family in that picture. Now, it\u2019s only her and Viserys. Turning back to the office door Dany walks the rest of the way and opens the door slowly. When she the door is completely open Viserys Targaryen glances up at the door while arguing with the person on the phone. He\u2019s about to look back down to his desk when he realizes who\u2019s at the threshold of the doorway. Looking at his little sister in pure shock he mumbles to the person on the phone.</p><p>\u201cI- I\u2019m going to have to call you back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, big brother.\u201d Daenerys smiles with a hidden motive in her eyes before shutting the door behind her, \u201cIt\u2019s been a good minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year\u2026 Give or take\u2026\u201d He puts the phone down and leans back in his chair, \u201cWhat are you doing back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Revenge, justice. The usual.\u201d She answers with a shrug of her shoulders while looking at what he has done to their mother\u2019s old office, \u201cMore precisely\u2026 I\u2019m here to take back my life. Starting with what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany.\u201d Viserys chuckles while folding his arms, \u201cNothing in Westeros is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather\u2019s house, his land, mother\u2019s diner, and their fortune is mine.\u201d Dany declares with no humor in her voice, \u201cHalf of everything is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather left everything in my name when he passed away.\u201d</p><p>Viserys smiles easily at her making her clench her fists while she walks around the office. Their father, the mayor, and mother got separated when she was a freshman in high school. Her mother disappeared to Essos leaving the kids with their father, they haven\u2019t heard from or seen her since. Not long after that their father went crazy and they had to put him in an asylum. The end of Dany\u2019s sophomore year is when he committed suicide in his room. Their father\u2019s will stated by a lawyer that Viserys got everything, the money, the land, the diner, and his sister. However, Dany found a loophole in the will while she disappeared for a year. It\u2019s said that once Daenerys is a legal adult everyone will be in her name as well as Viserys. Taking out a file from her purse Dany throws it down on the desk saying.</p><p>\u201cHe did until yesterday\u2026 Do you remember what yesterday is?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Your birthday\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Grinning she points at the file of papers she gave him, \u201cDad\u2019s will states I get half of everything he owned once I\u2019m legally an adult. Yesterday was my 18th birthday.\u201d</p><p>Unamused Viserys stares at his little sister tiredly before opening up the will she put in front of him. They each got a copy of it when he died, Viserys gave his to his lawyer, Daenerys didn\u2019t have a lawyer so she held onto it. As he reads the parts that are highlighted his expression becomes serious and concerning. This only makes Daenerys smile widen while plopping down on a chair in front of his desk. She studied this will since the day their father died, she knows it word for word. He begins to panic as he skims through the papers from realizing what she\u2019s saying is true. His lawyer never brought up that once she comes of age that she\u2019ll get half of everything. Putting the papers down and rubbing his face before asking quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing for the last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you ask.\u201d She smirks while taking her documents back, \u201cWell, after you kicked me out of the house with nothing. So I stole father\u2019s car, all his watches and decided to go to Essos with Missandei-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe orphan girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a dragon. Yes, Missandei.\u201d Dany sends him a bored look before continuing, \u201cWe decided to go to Essos and look for mother so this will would become irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t find her.\u201d She sighs hoping he doesn\u2019t see her disappointment, \u201cBut I found a good lawyer. He gave me a loophole. My age, so I\u2019ve been waiting. For this day and here it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want exactly, Daenerys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf. Of everything. Half of this diner, half of his money, half of his land.\u201d She answers seriously before sitting up straight and spitting out in anger, \u201cThis time you can\u2019t just kick me out either.\u201d</p><p>Her big and only brother stares at her trying to think of a way out of this. He wasn\u2019t prepared at all for this, he didn\u2019t think she would show her face in Westeros again. Not after all the pain, she endured in this town. After a month of the will being in effect, Viserys told Dany she had to move out. Viserys told the town it was because her behavior was similar to their crazy father. She stayed with Missandei in her dorm room at Seven Kingdom High for a few days trying to find a way around this. That\u2019s when Missandei came up with the idea to look for Dany\u2019s mother. Their parents never got legally divorced, so technically everything of her father\u2019s is her\u2019s still. No one knows where she went through which is why everything was given to Viserys. She also offered to go with Dany since the foster care told her that her parents are there too. So they left to Essos without telling anyone in fear of Viserys trying to sabotage them. The girls stole the car so they could drive to Essos and the priceless watches to live of off. Halfway through the year they still haven\u2019t found anyone they been searching for. However, their lawyer found a loophole. Her age. So they waited until she turned 18 to take back what\u2019s hers. One way or another she will get her half of her father\u2019s fortune.</p><p>\u201cEverything is in my name now.\u201d Viserys sends her a poker face, \u201cDad has nothing to his name now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Leaning on the table smiling she points out, \u201cBut my lawyer informed me that you would need another Targaryen to sign off on it. Mother\u2019s nowhere to be found, I didn\u2019t sign it and last I checked we were the last in the family with the name, Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did your research, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I\u2019m not that little girl you kicked out a year ago. So this is how it\u2019s going to go down.\u201d Standing up Daenerys looks down at her brother with no room to argue, \u201cI\u2019m going to move back in, I\u2019m going to work here, you\u2019re going to call your lawyer and he\u2019s going to get us a co-owned document for the diner, the land, the money and the house that YOU will sign. My lawyer will be in town within a few days to finalize the document. If you argue with me about this or try anything, I won\u2019t hesitate to take this to court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you disappeared for a year just to come back to get half of everything of Father\u2019s heritage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you plan on staying in Westeros?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I plan to attend Seven Kingdom High for my senior year.\u201d Dany explains while folding her arms, \u201cSo you aren\u2019t getting rid of me so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Viserys sends her a knowingly look, \u201cIt may have been a year but Westeros still remembers all the damage you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my life back.\u201d She spits out in anger, \u201cIf a few locals look at me funny so be it but I will not leave Westeros just because of my past. Don\u2019t try me, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I get it. You\u2019re here to stay.\u201d Viserys sighs knowing his sister isn\u2019t going to back down, \u201cYou can move back in and I\u2019ll get you your old job here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call up my lawyer tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, now keys.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys puts her hand out making Viserys roll his eyes and go into a draw. He pulls out a keychain with a handful of keys. Tossing them to her she catches them easily and inspects them. They are all new keys, she doesn\u2019t recognize any of them. One was even a button and she never had one like that before. Looking up as at Viserys he sighs knowing he\u2019s going have to explain which is which. Pointing at the key her brother speaks up and explains.</p><p>\u201cThese are the keys for the front and back door of the diner, the front gate of our house, the front and back door of said house, and the garage door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, big brother.\u201d</p><p>Dany says too sweetly for his taste as she stands up. Viserys watching her jiggle the keys in her hands with an expression of terror, he feels like he just opened Hell. He should have known she\u2019ll be with fire in her eyes and the taste for revenge. Half their family dies and disappears, he then takes everything from her, forces her out of the house with nothing and makes the town believe she\u2019s a monster like their father. He was stupid to think she wouldn\u2019t come back. Looking at her now he knows she\u2019s changed since she took off to Essos. She wasn\u2019t someone he could push around for his benefit anymore. Sending her brother a look she walks toward the door and says one last thing.</p><p>\u201cOh. In the document\u2026\u201d Dany speaks up sweetly while opening the door, \u201cDad\u2019s Mustang is under my name. Only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Visery shrugs carefree before raising an eyebrow, \u201cI never wanted his car anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Smirking she walks out the door and says one last thing without looking his way, \u201cSee you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Slamming the door behind her she walks through the diner and out the door without looking anyone\u2019s way. She didn\u2019t care if the employees were listening to them or if the customers were sending her weird looks. Daenerys walks out of the diner as if she owned the place, which she will in time. Seeing Missandei still waiting beside the Mustang she lifts the keys and jiggles it. The sound makes both girls laugh in joy, their plan was slowly but surely working. Leaning off the car Missandei smirks while saying in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThat was quick. I thought he would put up a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did too.\u201d Daenerys thinks out loud while opening the driver\u2019s door and leaning on it, \u201cHe\u2019s hiding something. Dad must\u2019ve had more than just this diner for him to easy give me half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else could your Dad have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighs while looking around the diner, \u201cBut I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d</p><hr><p>Reaching a neighborhood the Mad Mayor\u2019s daughter slows down looking for the place she used to call home. The Essos orphan looks around in shock, the street was filled with land and mansions, she forgot how rich the Targaryens were. Making a stop Danny checks the number beside the gate to make sure it was the right place since this was where they last lived at. It was the same place but it looks almost completely different. The gate is much bigger and elegant than the one she\u2019s used to, she notices in the corner is a security camera which wasn\u2019t there before. Getting closer to it she rolls down her windows and says into the speaker beside her car but really to herself.</p><p>\u201cHow do I unlock my own damn gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave you a key, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but to the actual gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, state your name.\u201d Someone says through the speaker, \u201cAnd your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaenerys Targaryen.\u201d She says awkwardly while sending Missandei a confused expression, \u201cViserys sister. I kind of live here.\u201d</p><p>A camera next to the speaker turns on and faces Dany, for a moment the camera\u2019s light blinks. When it stops the gate opens up for her, they must have needed proof that it was her. Rolling up the window she starts driving down the road. Behind the gate are 25 acres of land owned by the Targaryens. At the back end of the acres is a small beach to the ocean and on one side is a forest. On the other is a small rocky hill. In the center of the land is her home, she remembered it being too small to be a mansion but too big to be an ordinary house. Looking at it now she realizes Visery made some big motivations to it. It\u2019s still a three-story house with a balcony, three cars garage, outdoor pool, but now there is so much more to it that she doesn\u2019t know about. Driving down the small road to the house she notices three Thoroughbred horses running alongside in empty fields. Her horses to be exact, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, two of them were dark brown and one is black as night. She thought Viserys would sell them once she left, they\u2019re worth good money. Slowing down Daenerys parks her car in front of her house gets out and slams the door behind her. Missandei the gets out and looks at the house in surprise before speaking to nobody in particular.</p><p>\u201cHe did some remodeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dany thinks out loud while walking off the road and onto the grass toward her three horses. They were the hardest things she had to leave behind. They all stopped sprinting and just jog between the trees that are on the edge of the forest. Watching her best friend Missandei goes around to the trunk she pops it open and grabs their bags before slamming it shut. The sound makes Drogon turn his head only to see her as he runs between the other horses. Seeing her gets him to lift his head up and neigh, Rhaegal and Viserion do the same immediately. Laughing softly she watches them running for a moment longer. Taking one last look she turns around to go to the front porch. She takes out her keys and unlocks the front door, it opens easy enough. Walking in slowly Missandei follows behind her with all the bags. Looking around the main room Daenerys breathes in heavily knowing she\u2019s finally back home. A lot of things look different but she sees a few things that are still the same. The oil painting of there family is still hanging up and table mother bought when they first got the house is still in the room with a bouquet of flowers. Missandei drops all their things and moves to stand by her best friend before asking softly.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better than okay.\u201d She smiles with longing in her eyes, \u201cI\u2019m finally taking back my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still know your way around here-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Targaryen. Glad to see you\u2019re back in town.\u201d</p><p>The girls look away from each other when hearing a third voice come into the room. A man Dany has never seen walk in looking around his 40 or 50s. He has his left eye covered with a patch and he\u2019s wearing a clean-cut suit. He looks like he came right out of an FBI movie. He smiles at her politely with his hands behind his back. The girls look at one another confused before eyeing him. He must have been hired after she vanished because they never hired anyone for the house, they did everything themselves. When he reaches them he lifts his hand up for her to shake while introducing himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Beric Dondarrion. Your Butler, Security, and Housekeeper. Visery hired me half a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny.\u201d She shakes his hand slowly before nodding to her friend, \u201cThis is Missandei. Were you the guy I heard on the speaker at the gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ma'am. Your brother made a few motivations while you were gone.\u201d He answers before grabbing their bags, \u201cNo worries though. Your room is still the same as you left it. I\u2019ll give you the guest room beside her\u2019s Missandei. May I ask how long you will stay so I alert the rest of the staff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest of the staff?\u201d Missandei whispers to Dany but she just shrugs before answering, \u201cI\u2019m staying permanently but Sandei is only staying a few days just until she gets her dorm room back at Seven Kingdom high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He begins walking with their bags to the stairs with them following slowly behind, \u201cI\u2019ll enroll you ladies into school tomorrow and make sure you get a room, Missandei. Would you like your old room back or a new one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did my brother hire you?\u201d Dany blurts out while they walk down the hall, \u201cNo offense but we never needed a butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisery became so busy with the Diner and everything your father pass down to him that he could take care of the house and land on his own.\u201d He explains when they reach two doors, \u201cSo he hired me to take care of the house while his main focus is on the Diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did our father pass down to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt be better if you asked your brother himself.\u201d Beric suggests as he puts their things down, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t informed me on anything other than the Diner, Land, House, and his father\u2019s politicians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoliticians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here is your room Ms. Targaryen.\u201d He motions to the left door then adds, \u201cI\u2019ll let the staff know you\u2019ll be staying in the guest room so they can stock it up with towels and other toiletries. If you need anything else there is an intercom in each room that was installed a few months back\u201d</p><p>With that said he nods at the girls before leaving them to themselves in the hall. Missandei raises an eyebrow at Dany causing her to frown knowing something seems off. They never had security before, even when their father was the Mayor they didn\u2019t have one. Plus, what did he mean by everything their father pass down to Visery? Was there more than what she was told? And what the hell was he talking about Politicians? Her brother was never into politics or so she thought. Picking up her bags she opens her door and tells Missandei.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to unpack and head to the stables after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I want to look around your house anyway before your brother gets home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>They both go into their rooms and shut the door behind them. Instantly going into her room Daenerys realized he was right, Viserys didn\u2019t even touch her room while she was gone. Everything was still there and in the same spot. Everything just had a sheet on it so it would collect dust. Taking the sheet off her bed she drops her bag on it before taking the sheets of the rest of her things. When taking the sheet off her desk she sees the dozen of pictures from her sophomore year. One frame has her, Missandei, Grey Worm, Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont all together at the diner. Another has her and Arya and Sansa Stark at the homecoming dance. The third is her and Khal Drogo kissing on their six month anniversary. Picking that one up she looks at it for a second longer before throwing it across the room and hitting the wall. Never again, she thought. She\u2019ll let a man dictate her life like he did. Going over to the fallen picture she picks it up and sees it badly cracked. Smiling at it she throws it away before finally unpacking.</p><hr><p>\u201cHey. Baby.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys whispers as she walks up to her horse darker than night, Drogon. He was eating grass in the middle of a meadow near their house. The sun was setting and the staff was about to clean him off before going into the barn for the night. The other horses, Rhaegal and Viserion, were in the barn already cleaned by strangers who got hired after she vanished. When she visited them they were confused and frightened at first. After trying to calm them down they finally realized who she was. She isn\u2019t wearing anything she used to wear around them but her hair was still golden white as long as theirs which made them know it was her. Walking toward Drogon though he knew instantly who she is and started trotting toward her. Smiling at the sight of his tail swaying from side to side she says a little louder than before.</p><p>\u201cRemember me?\u201d</p><p>He comes up to her and snorts before sniffing her hair in the crook of her neck. Giggling she raises her hands to pet the side of his head. The wind picks up making both of their hair move wildly. She begins walking to pet his back he turns his head to watch her. Smiling softly she wraps her arms around him and leans her head on his back to hug him. Realizing she brought his favorite snack she pulls it out of her pocket. A peppermint, the sight makes him turn and eat it right out of her pam. Petting his mane she speaks up again as if he was a person.</p><p>\u201cMy biggest regret was not bringing you guys with me.\u201d</p><p>He licks her hand even after he ate the peppermint.</p><p>\u201cI promise. It won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m here to stay.\u201d</p><p>They begin walking beside one another with her hand on his back and his tail wagging as if he was a dog. Drogon was her first horse, her mother had given him to her as a birthday present when she was still with them. He was just a baby, she raised him into the horse he is now. She never had a staff to help take of him, it was all her. She cleaned him, took care of the barn, took him to the vet when sick. Same with Rhaegal and Viserion, her father gave her both of them one a few years later when they were babies as well. They were all races horses, breed to be in racing. She used to enter every horse race with Drogon, in school, and in State race. However, when her mother vanished all that stopped, she still took care of them but not race publically. It was always reminded her of her mother. This past year though, Dany finally came to terms that her mother isn\u2019t coming back and might as well be dead. So maybe it\u2019s time to get back into racing, it\u2019s the only thing she really knows how to do. They reach where the meadow turns into sand, the ocean is only a few yards away. Standing still while watching the small waves crash into the sand Daenery asks.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s time to get back into the game?\u201d</p><p>His only answer a little tug on her hair.</p><hr><p>\u201cDany! Check it out! You won\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Daenerys speaks up throwing a few things into the trash, \u201cAbout the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. About your childhood crush.\u201d</p><p>Missandei runs into her best friend\u2019s room in her pajamas. She plops onto her bed before taking out her phone. It\u2019s late at night and Viserys still hasn\u2019t come home yet. He still has an hour before Dany starting asking questions. When she got back from putting Drogon in the stables she started changing her room and throwing out things she didn\u2019t want or need anymore. Dany has been throwing out old clothes when she came in, trashing the last of her small clothes she goes to sit next to Missandei. She going through her phone until she gets on Twitter while explaining.</p><p>\u201cI finally got on my old Twitter and Snapchat since we\u2019re back and about to start school. You wouldn\u2019t believe what happened while we were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess Shae is still a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d Missandei thinks out loud while looking through Twitter, \u201cBronn Stark got his GED, and his older brother Robb graduated last year. But what I wanted to tell you is that Daario Naharis is apparently single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d</p><p>Since Dany has met Daario Naharis she\u2019s had a huge crush on him but he always was talking to some girl. They were friends all in middle and high school but nothing more. She never really tried getting him since it would be competing with the other girls he was dating. If Sandei was right though, then she didn\u2019t have to compete with a girlfriend. Her best friend hands her the phone, it\u2019s on Daario Naharis Twitter profile. There\u2019s no girl\u2019s name in the bio or a date when he started dating someone and no girl in his head page. She goes to his photos and begins looking through them when she comes across a picture with someone else. Jon Snow, the bastard in the Stark family. Daario and Jon have their around each other\u2019s shoulder, they each have a beer in their free hand. The two are smiling big, it looks like they\u2019re at The Faceless Hub, it\u2019s a bar. He looks different from how she remembers him if it wasn\u2019t for his soft puppy eye she might not have even recognize him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ayra and Sansa bastard brother right?\u201d Dany asks Sandei while staring at the picture, \u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still dating Ygritte.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at the picture of him one last time a memory of him flashes in her mind of who he used to be. He wore old looking shirts and ripped jeans back when she was in school with him, he must have changed after Sophomore year when she left. Jon\u2019s hair is now longer but still the same color with loose curls, it\u2019s in a man bun in the photo. He also has grown a short beard. His body is now rock hard in his tight plain black shirt and letterman\u2019s jacket. He\u2019s wearing dark blue jeans with black shoes. He has a silver chain around his neck but she can\u2019t see if he has a pendant on it or not. He looked good, she always thought he looked nice before but now he looks more like a man and less like a boy. Looking at the picture a few seconds longer a few memories of him and her cross her mind. Before she can too much at old memories and hands the phone back to Missandei and takes out her own. Sandei looks at the picture of Daario and Jon before smirking and sending Dany a look.

Everything I do in this town is crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We want to come back to Westeros right. We need to be at least civil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get it. We need to do this right.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen, A.K.A Dany, sighs as she clenches the steering wheel. Music blasting, flooring the car, windows down Daenerys Targaryen speeds into her hometown, Westeros. Her best friend, Missandei, sits in the passenger seat with her arm out the window. They&rsquo;re driving in an old clean-cut black 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. It&rsquo;s been a whole year since they vanished with that car. No one in Westeros thought Daenerys or Missandei would ever come back. Hearing the music and the engine roar, the town realize they haven&rsquo;t seen the last of them. Dany drives into the parking lot of her family&rsquo;s diner, The DragonStone Diner. The diner&rsquo;s on the edge of the beach, it looks exactly the same as when they left. They were only 17 when they left, it was the end of their sophomore year at the time. The two girls get out of the car and into the hot summertime weather. While Missandei looks around their surroundings Daenerys stares at the family&rsquo;s restaurant in front of her. It feels like she never left a year ago just put everything on hold. Leaning on the car Missandei asks concerning as her best friend looks ready to start a war.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to come in with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Dany sighs as she looks down at her car keys before clenching them in her hand, &ldquo;This is between my brother and me.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls give each other one last look before Daenerys walks toward her family&rsquo;s Diner. Folding her arms Missandei stay by the car waiting. People on the sidewalk stop what they&rsquo;re doing at the sight of the two girls and the Mustang. No one in town has a car like that besides the Mad Mayor and only a year ago did his daughter drive away with it with her orphan friend. The hairs on everyone backs stand up since they all know where ever that mustang goes chaos follows. Seeing the locals in Westeros look her way in shock Daenerys smirks knowingly beneath her sunglasses as she gets closer to the front door. The bell jingles as Daenerys walks through the door followed by the click of her heels. Half of the customers in the diner are already staring at her from seeing in the parking lot and the other half just then turns to see her. There were a lot of locals and students from her old school, Seven Kingdom High, here. Looking around casually Daenerys takes off her sunglasses, the place looks just how she left it besides a new paint job. Walking toward the counter she notices the room has gone unbearable silent.</p><p>&ldquo;C-Can I help you?&rdquo; A waitress Dany doesn&rsquo;t recognize asks nervously from behind the counter, &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My brother.&rdquo; Daenerys sends her a bored look, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his office.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo; She smiles before walking toward her mother&rsquo;s old office, &ldquo;Thank-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You can&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo; The waitress then speaks up making Dany stop in place, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not my problem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; Dany points at the woman threateningly, &ldquo;If you tell me I can&rsquo;t see my brother in OUR diner one more time I will make sure you&rsquo;re the first that I fire.&rdquo;</p><p>The waitress doesn&rsquo;t dare say another word making Daenerys smile politely and continue walking. She doesn&rsquo;t look around the room but she knows everyone&rsquo;s staring at her. Going down a hall she sees a door cracked opened at the end. She can hear her big brother on the phone talking to someone in a commanding tone. They must be doing business. She&rsquo;s about to reach the door when she stops by the sight of a photo on the wall. It&rsquo;s a picture of her parents, her as a baby and Viserys as a child standing in front of the diner. They took that photo the day they bought the building, they were a family in that picture. Now, it&rsquo;s only her and Viserys. Turning back to the office door Dany walks the rest of the way and opens the door slowly. When she the door is completely open Viserys Targaryen glances up at the door while arguing with the person on the phone. He&rsquo;s about to look back down to his desk when he realizes who&rsquo;s at the threshold of the doorway. Looking at his little sister in pure shock he mumbles to the person on the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I&rsquo;m going to have to call you back later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, big brother.&rdquo; Daenerys smiles with a hidden motive in her eyes before shutting the door behind her, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A year&hellip; Give or take&hellip;&rdquo; He puts the phone down and leans back in his chair, &ldquo;What are you doing back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know. Revenge, justice. The usual.&rdquo; She answers with a shrug of her shoulders while looking at what he has done to their mother&rsquo;s old office, &ldquo;More precisely&hellip; I&rsquo;m here to take back my life. Starting with what&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dany.&rdquo; Viserys chuckles while folding his arms, &ldquo;Nothing in Westeros is yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do tell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s house, his land, mother&rsquo;s diner, and their fortune is mine.&rdquo; Dany declares with no humor in her voice, &ldquo;Half of everything is mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father left everything in my name when he passed away.&rdquo;</p><p>Viserys smiles easily at her making her clench her fists while she walks around the office. Their father, the mayor, and mother got separated when she was a freshman in high school. Her mother disappeared to Essos leaving the kids with their father, they haven&rsquo;t heard from or seen her since. Not long after that their father went crazy and they had to put him in an asylum. The end of Dany&rsquo;s sophomore year is when he committed suicide in his room. Their father&rsquo;s will stated by a lawyer that Viserys got everything, the money, the land, the diner, and his sister. However, Dany found a loophole in the will while she disappeared for a year. It&rsquo;s said that once Daenerys is a legal adult everyone will be in her name as well as Viserys. Taking out a file from her purse Dany throws it down on the desk saying.</p><p>&ldquo;He did until yesterday&hellip; Do you remember what yesterday is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Your birthday&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Grinning she points at the file of papers she gave him, &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s will states I get half of everything he owned once I&rsquo;m legally an adult. Yesterday was my 18th birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>Unamused Viserys stares at his little sister tiredly before opening up the will she put in front of him. They each got a copy of it when he died, Viserys gave his to his lawyer, Daenerys didn&rsquo;t have a lawyer so she held onto it. As he reads the parts that are highlighted his expression becomes serious and concerning. This only makes Daenerys smile widen while plopping down on a chair in front of his desk. She studied this will since the day their father died, she knows it word for word. He begins to panic as he skims through the papers from realizing what she&rsquo;s saying is true. His lawyer never brought up that once she comes of age that she&rsquo;ll get half of everything. Putting the papers down and rubbing his face before asking quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;What have you been doing for the last year?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you ask.&rdquo; She smirks while taking her documents back, &ldquo;Well, after you kicked me out of the house with nothing. So I stole father&rsquo;s car, all his watches and decided to go to Essos with Missandei-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The orphan girl?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, a dragon. Yes, Missandei.&rdquo; Dany sends him a bored look before continuing, &ldquo;We decided to go to Essos and look for mother so this will would become irrelevant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t find her.&rdquo; She sighs hoping he doesn&rsquo;t see her disappointment, &ldquo;But I found a good lawyer. He gave me a loophole. My age, so I&rsquo;ve been waiting. For this day and here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want exactly, Daenerys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Half. Of everything. Half of this diner, half of his money, half of his land.&rdquo; She answers seriously before sitting up straight and spitting out in anger, &ldquo;This time you can&rsquo;t just kick me out either.&rdquo;</p><p>Her big and only brother stares at her trying to think of a way out of this. He wasn&rsquo;t prepared at all for this, he didn&rsquo;t think she would show her face in Westeros again. Not after all the pain, she endured in this town. After a month of the will being in effect, Viserys told Dany she had to move out. Viserys told the town it was because her behavior was similar to their crazy father. She stayed with Missandei in her dorm room at Seven Kingdom High for a few days trying to find a way around this. That&rsquo;s when Missandei came up with the idea to look for Dany&rsquo;s mother. Their parents never got legally divorced, so technically everything of her father&rsquo;s is her&rsquo;s still. No one knows where she went through which is why everything was given to Viserys. She also offered to go with Dany since the foster care told her that her parents are there too. So they left to Essos without telling anyone in fear of Viserys trying to sabotage them. The girls stole the car so they could drive to Essos and the priceless watches to live of off. Halfway through the year they still haven&rsquo;t found anyone they been searching for. However, their lawyer found a loophole. Her age. So they waited until she turned 18 to take back what&rsquo;s hers. One way or another she will get her half of her father&rsquo;s fortune.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is in my name now.&rdquo; Viserys sends her a poker face, &ldquo;Dad has nothing to his name now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See that&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; Leaning on the table smiling she points out, &ldquo;But my lawyer informed me that you would need another Targaryen to sign off on it. Mother&rsquo;s nowhere to be found, I didn&rsquo;t sign it and last I checked we were the last in the family with the name, Targaryen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did your research, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, I&rsquo;m not that little girl you kicked out a year ago. So this is how it&rsquo;s going to go down.&rdquo; Standing up Daenerys looks down at her brother with no room to argue, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to move back in, I&rsquo;m going to work here, you&rsquo;re going to call your lawyer and he&rsquo;s going to get us a co-owned document for the diner, the land, the money and the house that YOU will sign. My lawyer will be in town within a few days to finalize the document. If you argue with me about this or try anything, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to take this to court.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you disappeared for a year just to come back to get half of everything of Father&rsquo;s heritage?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long do you plan on staying in Westeros?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I plan to attend Seven Kingdom High for my senior year.&rdquo; Dany explains while folding her arms, &ldquo;So you aren&rsquo;t getting rid of me so soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really think that&rsquo;s a good idea?&rdquo; Viserys sends her a knowingly look, &ldquo;It may have been a year but Westeros still remembers all the damage you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want my life back.&rdquo; She spits out in anger, &ldquo;If a few locals look at me funny so be it but I will not leave Westeros just because of my past. Don&rsquo;t try me, brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. I get it. You&rsquo;re here to stay.&rdquo; Viserys sighs knowing his sister isn&rsquo;t going to back down, &ldquo;You can move back in and I&rsquo;ll get you your old job here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call up my lawyer tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, now keys.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys puts her hand out making Viserys roll his eyes and go into a draw. He pulls out a keychain with a handful of keys. Tossing them to her she catches them easily and inspects them. They are all new keys, she doesn&rsquo;t recognize any of them. One was even a button and she never had one like that before. Looking up as at Viserys he sighs knowing he&rsquo;s going have to explain which is which. Pointing at the key her brother speaks up and explains.</p><p>&ldquo;These are the keys for the front and back door of the diner, the front gate of our house, the front and back door of said house, and the garage door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, big brother.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany says too sweetly for his taste as she stands up. Viserys watching her jiggle the keys in her hands with an expression of terror, he feels like he just opened Hell. He should have known she&rsquo;ll be with fire in her eyes and the taste for revenge. Half their family dies and disappears, he then takes everything from her, forces her out of the house with nothing and makes the town believe she&rsquo;s a monster like their father. He was stupid to think she wouldn&rsquo;t come back. Looking at her now he knows she&rsquo;s changed since she took off to Essos. She wasn&rsquo;t someone he could push around for his benefit anymore. Sending her brother a look she walks toward the door and says one last thing.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. In the document&hellip;&rdquo; Dany speaks up sweetly while opening the door, &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s Mustang is under my name. Only.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Visery shrugs carefree before raising an eyebrow, &ldquo;I never wanted his car anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good to know.&rdquo; Smirking she walks out the door and says one last thing without looking his way, &ldquo;See you at dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>Slamming the door behind her she walks through the diner and out the door without looking anyone&rsquo;s way. She didn&rsquo;t care if the employees were listening to them or if the customers were sending her weird looks. Daenerys walks out of the diner as if she owned the place, which she will in time. Seeing Missandei still waiting beside the Mustang she lifts the keys and jiggles it. The sound makes both girls laugh in joy, their plan was slowly but surely working. Leaning off the car Missandei smirks while saying in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;That was quick. I thought he would put up a fight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did too.&rdquo; Daenerys thinks out loud while opening the driver&rsquo;s door and leaning on it, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hiding something. Dad must&rsquo;ve had more than just this diner for him to easy give me half of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else could your Dad have?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She sighs while looking around the diner, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to find out.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Reaching a neighborhood the Mad Mayor&rsquo;s daughter slows down looking for the place she used to call home. The Essos orphan looks around in shock, the street was filled with land and mansions, she forgot how rich the Targaryens were. Making a stop Danny checks the number beside the gate to make sure it was the right place since this was where they last lived at. It was the same place but it looks almost completely different. The gate is much bigger and elegant than the one she&rsquo;s used to, she notices in the corner is a security camera which wasn&rsquo;t there before. Getting closer to it she rolls down her windows and says into the speaker beside her car but really to herself.</p><p>&ldquo;How do I unlock my own damn gate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He gave you a key, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but to the actual gate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, state your name.&rdquo; Someone says through the speaker, &ldquo;And your business.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Daenerys Targaryen.&rdquo; She says awkwardly while sending Missandei a confused expression, &ldquo;Viserys sister. I kind of live here.&rdquo;</p><p>A camera next to the speaker turns on and faces Dany, for a moment the camera&rsquo;s light blinks. When it stops the gate opens up for her, they must have needed proof that it was her. Rolling up the window she starts driving down the road. Behind the gate are 25 acres of land owned by the Targaryens. At the back end of the acres is a small beach to the ocean and on one side is a forest. On the other is a small rocky hill. In the center of the land is her home, she remembered it being too small to be a mansion but too big to be an ordinary house. Looking at it now she realizes Visery made some big motivations to it. It&rsquo;s still a three-story house with a balcony, three cars garage, outdoor pool, but now there is so much more to it that she doesn&rsquo;t know about. Driving down the small road to the house she notices three Thoroughbred horses running alongside in empty fields. Her horses to be exact, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, two of them were dark brown and one is black as night. She thought Viserys would sell them once she left, they&rsquo;re worth good money. Slowing down Daenerys parks her car in front of her house gets out and slams the door behind her. Missandei the gets out and looks at the house in surprise before speaking to nobody in particular.</p><p>&ldquo;He did some remodeling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dany thinks out loud while walking off the road and onto the grass toward her three horses. They were the hardest things she had to leave behind. They all stopped sprinting and just jog between the trees that are on the edge of the forest. Watching her best friend Missandei goes around to the trunk she pops it open and grabs their bags before slamming it shut. The sound makes Drogon turn his head only to see her as he runs between the other horses. Seeing her gets him to lift his head up and neigh, Rhaegal and Viserion do the same immediately. Laughing softly she watches them running for a moment longer. Taking one last look she turns around to go to the front porch. She takes out her keys and unlocks the front door, it opens easy enough. Walking in slowly Missandei follows behind her with all the bags. Looking around the main room Daenerys breathes in heavily knowing she&rsquo;s finally back home. A lot of things look different but she sees a few things that are still the same. The oil painting of there family is still hanging up and table mother bought when they first got the house is still in the room with a bouquet of flowers. Missandei drops all their things and moves to stand by her best friend before asking softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than okay.&rdquo; She smiles with longing in her eyes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m finally taking back my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you still know your way around here-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Targaryen. Glad to see you&rsquo;re back in town.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls look away from each other when hearing a third voice come into the room. A man Dany has never seen walk in looking around his 40 or 50s. He has his left eye covered with a patch and he&rsquo;s wearing a clean-cut suit. He looks like he came right out of an FBI movie. He smiles at her politely with his hands behind his back. The girls look at one another confused before eyeing him. He must have been hired after she vanished because they never hired anyone for the house, they did everything themselves. When he reaches them he lifts his hand up for her to shake while introducing himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Beric Dondarrion. Your Butler, Security, and Housekeeper. Visery hired me half a year ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Danny.&rdquo; She shakes his hand slowly before nodding to her friend, &ldquo;This is Missandei. Were you the guy I heard on the speaker at the gate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma'am. Your brother made a few motivations while you were gone.&rdquo; He answers before grabbing their bags, &ldquo;No worries though. Your room is still the same as you left it. I&rsquo;ll give you the guest room beside her&rsquo;s Missandei. May I ask how long you will stay so I alert the rest of the staff?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rest of the staff?&rdquo; Missandei whispers to Dany but she just shrugs before answering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying permanently but Sandei is only staying a few days just until she gets her dorm room back at Seven Kingdom high.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He begins walking with their bags to the stairs with them following slowly behind, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll enroll you ladies into school tomorrow and make sure you get a room, Missandei. Would you like your old room back or a new one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did my brother hire you?&rdquo; Dany blurts out while they walk down the hall, &ldquo;No offense but we never needed a butler.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Visery became so busy with the Diner and everything your father pass down to him that he could take care of the house and land on his own.&rdquo; He explains when they reach two doors, &ldquo;So he hired me to take care of the house while his main focus is on the Diner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else did our father pass down to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It be better if you asked your brother himself.&rdquo; Beric suggests as he puts their things down, &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t informed me on anything other than the Diner, Land, House, and his father&rsquo;s politicians.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Politicians?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, here is your room Ms. Targaryen.&rdquo; He motions to the left door then adds, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the staff know you&rsquo;ll be staying in the guest room so they can stock it up with towels and other toiletries. If you need anything else there is an intercom in each room that was installed a few months back&rdquo;</p><p>With that said he nods at the girls before leaving them to themselves in the hall. Missandei raises an eyebrow at Dany causing her to frown knowing something seems off. They never had security before, even when their father was the Mayor they didn&rsquo;t have one. Plus, what did he mean by everything their father pass down to Visery? Was there more than what she was told? And what the hell was he talking about Politicians? Her brother was never into politics or so she thought. Picking up her bags she opens her door and tells Missandei.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to unpack and head to the stables after.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. I want to look around your house anyway before your brother gets home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p><p>They both go into their rooms and shut the door behind them. Instantly going into her room Daenerys realized he was right, Viserys didn&rsquo;t even touch her room while she was gone. Everything was still there and in the same spot. Everything just had a sheet on it so it would collect dust. Taking the sheet off her bed she drops her bag on it before taking the sheets of the rest of her things. When taking the sheet off her desk she sees the dozen of pictures from her sophomore year. One frame has her, Missandei, Grey Worm, Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont all together at the diner. Another has her and Arya and Sansa Stark at the homecoming dance. The third is her and Khal Drogo kissing on their six month anniversary. Picking that one up she looks at it for a second longer before throwing it across the room and hitting the wall. Never again, she thought. She&rsquo;ll let a man dictate her life like he did. Going over to the fallen picture she picks it up and sees it badly cracked. Smiling at it she throws it away before finally unpacking.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Hey. Baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys whispers as she walks up to her horse darker than night, Drogon. He was eating grass in the middle of a meadow near their house. The sun was setting and the staff was about to clean him off before going into the barn for the night. The other horses, Rhaegal and Viserion, were in the barn already cleaned by strangers who got hired after she vanished. When she visited them they were confused and frightened at first. After trying to calm them down they finally realized who she was. She isn&rsquo;t wearing anything she used to wear around them but her hair was still golden white as long as theirs which made them know it was her. Walking toward Drogon though he knew instantly who she is and started trotting toward her. Smiling at the sight of his tail swaying from side to side she says a little louder than before.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember me?&rdquo;</p><p>He comes up to her and snorts before sniffing her hair in the crook of her neck. Giggling she raises her hands to pet the side of his head. The wind picks up making both of their hair move wildly. She begins walking to pet his back he turns his head to watch her. Smiling softly she wraps her arms around him and leans her head on his back to hug him. Realizing she brought his favorite snack she pulls it out of her pocket. A peppermint, the sight makes him turn and eat it right out of her pam. Petting his mane she speaks up again as if he was a person.</p><p>&ldquo;My biggest regret was not bringing you guys with me.&rdquo;</p><p>He licks her hand even after he ate the peppermint.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise. It won&rsquo;t happen again. I&rsquo;m here to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>They begin walking beside one another with her hand on his back and his tail wagging as if he was a dog. Drogon was her first horse, her mother had given him to her as a birthday present when she was still with them. He was just a baby, she raised him into the horse he is now. She never had a staff to help take of him, it was all her. She cleaned him, took care of the barn, took him to the vet when sick. Same with Rhaegal and Viserion, her father gave her both of them one a few years later when they were babies as well. They were all races horses, breed to be in racing. She used to enter every horse race with Drogon, in school, and in State race. However, when her mother vanished all that stopped, she still took care of them but not race publically. It was always reminded her of her mother. This past year though, Dany finally came to terms that her mother isn&rsquo;t coming back and might as well be dead. So maybe it&rsquo;s time to get back into racing, it&rsquo;s the only thing she really knows how to do. They reach where the meadow turns into sand, the ocean is only a few yards away. Standing still while watching the small waves crash into the sand Daenery asks.</p><p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s time to get back into the game?&rdquo;</p><p>His only answer a little tug on her hair.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Dany! Check it out! You won&rsquo;t believe this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Daenerys speaks up throwing a few things into the trash, &ldquo;About the house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. About your childhood crush.&rdquo;</p><p>Missandei runs into her best friend&rsquo;s room in her pajamas. She plops onto her bed before taking out her phone. It&rsquo;s late at night and Viserys still hasn&rsquo;t come home yet. He still has an hour before Dany starting asking questions. When she got back from putting Drogon in the stables she started changing her room and throwing out things she didn&rsquo;t want or need anymore. Dany has been throwing out old clothes when she came in, trashing the last of her small clothes she goes to sit next to Missandei. She going through her phone until she gets on Twitter while explaining.</p><p>&ldquo;I finally got on my old Twitter and Snapchat since we&rsquo;re back and about to start school. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe what happened while we were gone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me guess Shae is still a whore?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but that&rsquo;s nothing new.&rdquo; Missandei thinks out loud while looking through Twitter, &ldquo;Bronn Stark got his GED, and his older brother Robb graduated last year. But what I wanted to tell you is that Daario Naharis is apparently single.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo;</p><p>Since Dany has met Daario Naharis she&rsquo;s had a huge crush on him but he always was talking to some girl. They were friends all in middle and high school but nothing more. She never really tried getting him since it would be competing with the other girls he was dating. If Sandei was right though, then she didn&rsquo;t have to compete with a girlfriend. Her best friend hands her the phone, it&rsquo;s on Daario Naharis Twitter profile. There&rsquo;s no girl&rsquo;s name in the bio or a date when he started dating someone and no girl in his head page. She goes to his photos and begins looking through them when she comes across a picture with someone else. Jon Snow, the bastard in the Stark family. Daario and Jon have their around each other&rsquo;s shoulder, they each have a beer in their free hand. The two are smiling big, it looks like they&rsquo;re at The Faceless Hub, it&rsquo;s a bar. He looks different from how she remembers him if it wasn&rsquo;t for his soft puppy eye she might not have even recognize him.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Ayra and Sansa bastard brother right?&rdquo; Dany asks Sandei while staring at the picture, &ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s still dating Ygritte.&rdquo;</p><p>Glancing at the picture of him one last time a memory of him flashes in her mind of who he used to be. He wore old looking shirts and ripped jeans back when she was in school with him, he must have changed after Sophomore year when she left. Jon&rsquo;s hair is now longer but still the same color with loose curls, it&rsquo;s in a man bun in the photo. He also has grown a short beard. His body is now rock hard in his tight plain black shirt and letterman&rsquo;s jacket. He&rsquo;s wearing dark blue jeans with black shoes. He has a silver chain around his neck but she can&rsquo;t see if he has a pendant on it or not. He looked good, she always thought he looked nice before but now he looks more like a man and less like a boy. Looking at the picture a few seconds longer a few memories of him and her cross her mind. Before she can too much at old memories and hands the phone back to Missandei and takes out her own. Sandei looks at the picture of Daario and Jon before smirking and sending Dany a look. She doesn&rsquo;t notice since she begins downloading her old social media apps back onto her phone making Sandei say innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;You should get back on Instagram&hellip; You might like what you see.&rdquo;</p></p>",

He had risen from the dead, she transformed into a dragon. He wasn\u2019t just another bastard anymore, he was the prince who was promised. She was no longer an outlaw, she was the princess of the forest. When the two finally cross paths they become forever tangled in the lives of one another. History, however, reveals that the prince and the princess\u2019s fates have always been connected to each other. <br/></p><!-- more --><p><b>AFTER ROBERT BARATHEON&rsquo;S REBELLION</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, I finished my supper. Tell us again!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Tell you what again?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The legend of the Forest Princess, of course.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a story, Ayra. Not a legend.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Same thing!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward Stark, the warden of the North, chuckles at his two little girls banter while he quietly sips his soup. The entire Stark family&rsquo;s eating dinner in the dining hall on a long wooden table in front of the fireplace like any other night. His wife, Catelyn Stark, sends him a look across the dinner table from seeing her daughters fighting once again. They always fight and Edward is always no help when trying to dissolve it. Rickon Stark, who&rsquo;s barely a year old, begins to cry from the commotion. Robb and Bran Stark look at one another with an awkward gaze before trying to finish their food to leave the table. Sansa then ignores the argument she started with her little sister before asking her father.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Father\u2026 Please\u2026 Tell us. One more time.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Ayra speaks up, the argument forgotten, with a pouting expression, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our favorite story.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell it to me this time.&rdquo; Eddard Stark sighs while leaning back in his seat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully tired.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But you tell it better. You haven&rsquo;t told it in forever.&rdquo; Sansa points out while playing with her food, &ldquo;Everyone here wants to hear it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The head of the table asks innocently while looking at his children. The girls nod instantly, they&rsquo;re practically bouncing in their seats. They ask to hear the story at least once a week. The boys, Robb and Bran, look at him with a guilty expression making him realize they too would like to hear it. The boys never admit it but the story was one of their favorites too, it always seemed so real when their father told it to them. Turning to Catelyn she sends him a tired expression, she didn&rsquo;t care what he talked about. She just wanted them to stop fighting and the baby to stay asleep. After looking at each one of them he looks up and across the room to a child sitting by himself near their table. His bastard son, Jon Snow, sits alone at a table near theirs so he&rsquo;s able to listen to their conversation. He&rsquo;s been listening and watching as he ate his dinner. When seeing his father looks his way he looks down to his food quickly so it seems like he&rsquo;s just been peacefully eating. Sighing Edward looks back at his kids and nods before asking as if he didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So what story do you children want to hear again?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know which one we want to hear.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There are just so many stories\u2026&rdquo; Edward groans before looking over at Jon and saying, &ldquo;Do you know the story they&rsquo;re talking about, boy?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Princess of the Forest Kingdom.&rdquo; Jon coughs out nervously while glancing their way, &ldquo;\u2026 Right?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes! Jon, yes!&rdquo; Ayra shrieks while grinning excitedly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one. Oh, please tell it, father.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fine. Fine\u2026 Someone help me start it.&rdquo; Edward leans back in his seat before asking, &ldquo;Catelyn, darling?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It was a long, long time ago.&rdquo; She says dramatically making the children grin, &ldquo;Back when the Targaryen family ruled the seven kingdoms and full grown thirsty dragons ruled the sky. There was a kingdom, no common man knew of it\u2026 Honey?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It was a Kingdom made of the forest.&rdquo; Edward continues the story with as much enthusiasm as his wife, &ldquo;Every forest, land, mountain, ocean, lake, and river was connected as one big kingdom called\u2026 &rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;THE KINGDOM OF SAVAGES.&rdquo; Ayra and Sansa scream on the top of their lungs.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo; Edward chuckles while his wife sighs from their yelling before he adds, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a Kingdom of Savage men and women though. It was a kingdom of savage animals. Any animal you can think of was a part of that kingdom. All the dragons, birds, lizards, wolves, all animals lived in the Kingdom. However, it wasn&rsquo;t ruled by animals. The kingdom was ruled by a King and Queen, but not by just any King and Queen. It wasn&rsquo;t any Targaryen or Barrathon or even any mortal man on the throne that we know of. It was the Savage family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Savages?&rdquo; Catelyn snorts while closing her eyes, &ldquo;What an original name.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real house name, The Savages. Just like it was a real kingdom, a long time ago.&rdquo; Edward snaps as he sends his wife a look to not ruin the story, &ldquo;The Savage family were far more priceless than gold, any land, or even a single dragon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A dragon?&rdquo; Bran whispers with his food completely forgotten, &ldquo;How are they more priceless than a dragon? They&rsquo;re extinct now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Because they could transform into dragons.&rdquo; Edward leans on the table with a voice that held true secrets, &ldquo;They could turn into any animal they wanted at any time. That&rsquo;s why they were the Kings and Queens of the forest. They were the only ones who could understand or control the wild creatures in the forests\u2026 For centuries the Savages ruled over the forest by being a dragon or a lion or any animal for that matter.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What about the princess?&rdquo; Arya speaks up loudly before adding, &ldquo;Father tell us about the Princess of the forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting to it child.&rdquo; Edward laughs before giving his youngest daughter a smile, &ldquo;The only people who knew about the kingdom were the animals living there and the royal family of the seven kingdoms, the Targaryens. They would visit one another often discussing anything that had to do with ruling their kingdoms. They did this without telling anyone, but people listen and rumors spread. One day they decided it was time for the world to know about the Kingdom of Savages. Along with that decision, came a promise. A promise to unite the kingdoms with marriage. They had a vision of all living things being ruled under one King and Queen. So they promised that the next Savage daughter would marry the King of the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;For many years,&rdquo; Catelyn speaks up wanting to tell this part of the story, &ldquo;The Savage family only had sons. No daughters.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Until finally,&rdquo; Edward raises an eyebrow and smiles softly, &ldquo;They did.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Last time you told us this story you said she never did marry the King.&rdquo; Robb speaks up curiously as his mind skips ahead in the story, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, when they had their daughter they finally told the people of the seven kingdoms about the Kingdom of Savages along with the Royal family&rsquo;s ability to transform into animals.&rdquo; Edward answers seriously forgetting for a moment it was supposed to be just a bedtime story, &ldquo;As more and more people learned about them the more people began to fear them. When people are afraid&hellip; they do unforgivable things.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Catelyn looks up at her husband with a warning expression. He was getting very close to the true history and not a fake legend. All the kids were hanging on every word he said though. They&rsquo;ve all heard this story a million times, but every time they heard it they felt like it was the first. Their father always told it as if it was real as if he was there when it happened. They know it isn&rsquo;t though, how can anyone change from a person to a dragon? Looking around the table Edward eyes lands on Jon at the back table. Jon was looking at his food but his father knew better, he knows Jon&rsquo;s listening to every word of the story. With his eyes still on him, he continues the story.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Savages daughter, when born, was known all over the world as the Princess of the Forest. Some even called her the Goddess of the forest. Everyone loved her but as she got older people began to realize she too had her parents gift. At the time people were scared at the fact they could transform into animals. They thought it was witchcraft and dark magic. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the people to fear her being their Queen. They didn&rsquo;t want someone with power like that on a throne. So a group of people planned to kill every member of the Savage house. They killed everyone in her family and she was next on their list to murder but before they could she disappeared.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean disappear?&rdquo; Bran blurts out angrily, &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t just disappear! She&rsquo;s royalty.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Her family let the group kill them so she could escape and leave to Essos.&rdquo; Edward says in a low mysterious voice but at the end of his sentence, he turns to look at Jon seriously before finishing his story, &ldquo;Legend has it\u2026 That she&rsquo;s in Essos at this very moment. Waiting. For the Prince she was promised to crown her Queen the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>DURING ROBERT BARATHEON&rsquo;S REBELLION</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her, that&rsquo;s the last Savage.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;King Robert wants her alive but if you must kill her. By all means, kill her.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The ship was sinking faster with every second that past, most of the crew is lying dead on their own ship. More brutal soldiers came into view of the last Savage as she tried to take cover for her life. She was almost across the sea to Essos when ships from the Seven Kingdoms found the one she happens to be aboard. Emilia Savage, the last of her name, only 16 years of age runs to the end of the ship with soldiers following after her. It&rsquo;s pitch black and the rain hit harder than the waves but that didn&rsquo;t stop anyone from going after the Savage girl. Stopping Emilia&rsquo;s in the corner of the very edge of the ship, looking at the running soldiers she leans off the bow. Her hair and clothes cling onto her body, her breath is uncontrollably loud but that&rsquo;s the last of her worries. The king has wanted her head since the war started, now the fight is over and his soldiers have finally found her. The Captain of the ships who attacked the one she&rsquo;s on comes to stand in front of her only a few feet away before yelling.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Lady Emilia Savage, A Princess Of The Forest, traitor, Exiled and outlawed from the Seven Kingdoms, you are under arrest for the crimes against the new king, Robert Baratheon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What crimes have I committed?&rdquo; Emilia shouts through the rain while glancing down at the untamed sea, &ldquo;My family has done nothing but give loyalty to the throne!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Your family&rsquo;s loyalty is to the mad King!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to the forest! Nature! The Seven Kingdoms know this!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then why did you run? Lady Savage, we are no fools.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Robert Baratheon executed my parents because of the rumors and bedtime stories!&rdquo; She cries out in agony while looking for an escape, &ldquo;Would you have me believe he wouldn&rsquo;t do the same for me!?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He would have spared any child&rsquo;s life, not yours after running. Now. Men, arrest her!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The nameless Captain orders without giving her any more reasons to her arrest. She begins panicking knowing if they capture her, her death will not be with any mercy. Her parents weren&rsquo;t given a clean death, why would she? Soldiers begin coming towards her, one grabs her wrist and she backhands him. He steps back in shock before moving to hit her but he never gets the chance to. Emilia pushes herself off the edge before anyone else can lay another hand on her. She falls into the sea and all the Soldiers run to the edge to see where she&rsquo;s at. They see the forest green cloak that she was wearing only seconds before she fell floating up with no body attached. A soldier turns to his Captain after a moment of no sign of her and yells.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Capt'n, we can&rsquo;t possibly find her in this weather!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Another soldier blurts out making the Captain go to the edge of the ship. All the men look around curiously trying to find the reason to the man&rsquo;s single request. The men stand searching for a few moments and start to believe there&rsquo;s nothing to look at when a flash of red comes to their eyes. At first, they all think its blood, the blood of the last Savage, but as they all stare at it they realize the red isn&rsquo;t blood but scales. Red scales shimmer in the moonlight under the water making everyone on the ship look as if they&rsquo;ve seen a ghost. The red turns into green scales that flip out from the sea and let the soldiers see that the scales are a huge tail of a shark. Well, not a shark but the shape of one, no shark has ever been bright red or green. The tail goes back into the water as quickly as it came out and disappears into the deep blue. After a second of shock, all the men turn to their Captain in hope that he will tell them was is behind this madness. Shaking his head at seeing the impossible the ship&rsquo;s Captain announces.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Last Savage is dead. She died on her way to Essos, her body drowned in the sea.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But Cap-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are we clear?!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>All the soldiers shout as one before following their captain back to their own ships. They don&rsquo;t know what to make of what they saw in the water, how could they? They didn&rsquo;t see Emilia&rsquo;s body but instead a tail that changed from red to green. The Captain walks back to his ship more stressed than when he left it. How is he supposed to explain this to his King? He wasn&rsquo;t though, he wasn&rsquo;t going to tell the truth of this because the truth was nearly impossible. Two soldiers still linger by the bow, however, they look down at the cloak in the water. One then looks up at the other thinking like a madman before whispering to the other in complete bewilderness.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe that was-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; The other soldier automatically says knowing what his friend&rsquo;s thinking, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She was named a princess of the forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a name. Plus this is the sea, not the forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A forest can be under the sea though.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That rumor you think of isn&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then why kill her?&rdquo;</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;Did I hear the Dothraki correct?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes\u2026 Apparently, they found a Goddess living in the caves.&rdquo;</p><p>Jorah Mormont answers truly confused as they follow their Queen down the narrow cave. Daenerys Targaryen, true Queen of Westeros, follows two Dothraki soldiers with torches down a cave they can&rsquo;t see the end of it. Behind her are her most trusted friends and allies, Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis. Behind the two men were three more Dothraki. The cave is right below when the Dothraki live, it&rsquo;s pitch black and rocky in every place imaginable. The Dothraki wanted to leave with the Dragon Queen but refuse to go unless their hidden Goddess came with them. They found her when they came here and haven&rsquo;t left this place since. The three of them have no idea what they were talking about, there was no such thing as a real Goddess. If so how could she be under here for so long? As they continue to follow the soldiers Jorah says more to himself out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;It explains why they&rsquo;ve made this here resting place for so long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They made it clear they wouldn&rsquo;t leave with me unless the Goddess came along.&rdquo; Their Queen, Daenerys Taryegan, points out as the Dothraki soldiers show her the way to the cave, &ldquo;They believe it&rsquo;s will bring bad luck to them all if we leave her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this so-called Goddess, anyway?&rdquo; Daario snaps with an awkward chuckle, &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be that powerful if she&rsquo;s trapped in a cave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They said She&rsquo;s the Goddess of&hellip;The Forest or Nature, I think.&rdquo; The Mother of Dragon thinks out loud before asking, &ldquo;Right, Jorah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty much. They said nature but that could mean a lot of things.&rdquo;</p><p>One of the Dothraki speaks up using his original tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;He says we&rsquo;re close.&rdquo;</p><p>When reaching the end of the rock narrow cave a huge dome appears. The Dothraki men stop walking at the edge, one hands the torch to Daenerys and the other hands it to Daario. The three look at one another worried since just that action alone lets them know the soldier will not be following them any longer. The three slowly walk out into the big dome, they look anywhere for any sign of life. The men go in front of Daenerys at they walk further into the cave but stop when hearing a chain move against the rock floor. They wave their torches to find where the sound came from. The chain sound fills the room once more before the sound of a growl or takes the sound. Suddenly fire fills the air letting the three see a dragon in the flames. They all back up in shock, it wasn&rsquo;t possible. Dragons only became existing a few months ago by Daenerys, how could one be under here.</p><p>The fire the dragon breathed out lights torches all around the cave that the Dothraki must have put up. The three cover their eyes from how bright the room has became only to see a glimpse of the Dragon shrinking into a human body. The cave is now completely light up, it&rsquo;s much bigger than they thought it was in full light. In the center of it was a woman with a chain around her neck. The chain was long but not long enough to reach where the three were standing. The woman has long dark brown hair with only a simple slave dress on. Daenerys walks past the men to get a closer look at her. She&rsquo;s never seen this woman before but she doesn&rsquo;t look from Essos. People in Essos usually have tan skin and deep dark from hair with familiar faces. Her face looks different, her skin was lighter than people born in Essos. Coming a little closer to the woman Daenerys ask loudly.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Goddess of Nature to the Dothraki.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She says with her voice slightly shaken, &ldquo;But what is your birth name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re house name.&rdquo; Jorah then asks more precisely, &ldquo;What is your house name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Savage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Savage?&rdquo; Daario asks as if he heard it correctly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of such a name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I have.&rdquo; Daenery says in complete shock, &ldquo;My brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The woman begins laughing slowly while sitting in the center of the cave, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve heard that bedtime story.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys eyes are wide from thinking back to when she was only a child. Visery used to tell her a story in their studies about a Kingdom of Savages. It was a kingdom only made up of wild beasts ruled by a human and an animal. He said it was the kingdom of all forests the Savage house ruled over. Apparently, the Targaryen house adored them, loved them like their own family. The seven kingdoms didn&rsquo;t though, they feared them and wanted nothing to do with a King and Queen that could be human and a beast. Viserys told her the day all the dragons died the Savage house did too. It was always some made up legend when he told her the story. She vaguely remembers the story he told her but she&rsquo;ll never forget the name Savages. Coming closer to the woman Daenery asks cautiously,</p><p>&ldquo;Was it true? The Kingdom, the family, the deaths.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Every story told about my family is a little different.&rdquo; She mumbles without looking their way, &ldquo;The kingdom was real, the family was real, all the deaths were real\u2026 but one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yours.&rdquo;</p><p>The mother of Dragons breathes out in shock while coming even closer. She remembers Visery saying the family died along with all the dragons. He must not have known about this woman, about her surviving. Then again he never told her about how many were in the Savage family, he always talked about them as one thing. The two women, neither one born in Essos, were in Dothraki clothing standing inside a cave almost as big as a castle. The Savage woman sits with a chain around her neck that connected to the middle of the rocky cave. Kneeling down Daenerys looks at the chain and finds words embedded in a language she can not read. The chain must be rare enough not to be able to broke it with any weapon or fire, someone must have made this chain for people who were less than a god but more than a man. The last Targaryen stares at the woman in rare chains for a moment before asking.</p><p>&ldquo;Can these chains come off?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone can take it off beside the person wearing it.&rdquo; The woman answers while standing up and turning to her, &ldquo;Would you dare take it off me? You&rsquo;ve heard the stories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare say yes.&rdquo; Daenerys smiles before waving her hands around and saying in surprise, &ldquo;If you help me take back the throne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dany.&rdquo; Jorah speaks up in warning while taking a step closer, &ldquo;She was a dragon moments before. Take it off her and who knows what she&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; The woman growls with a smirk while she starts walking toward them, &ldquo;I can turn into any animal I want to at any time. Westeros feared my family because of it, Baratheon killed my family and exiled me because of it. The people who chained me up years ago feared me because of it. So tell me, why dare set me free when I am nothing but feared by many?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Targaryen, the last of my name.&rdquo; Daenerys announces while reaching the woman, &ldquo;In my family, we don&rsquo;t fear a gift, we embrace it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do we know she will stay true to her words?&rdquo; Daario then asks from where he&rsquo;s standing, &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a reason behind her being exiled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll stay true to her word, that&rsquo;s all a princess knows how to do.&rdquo; The Mother of Dragon says as if she&rsquo;s talking about herself before looking the woman in her eyes and saying in raw emotion, &ldquo;Fight for me, Savage, help me take back the throne. I will restore your family&rsquo;s name and honor them the way they should have. I will give you your freedom back when all this is said and done. We will restore-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What makes you think I care about my family&rsquo;s honor?&rdquo; The outlaw spits out in the chains holding her, &ldquo;My family&rsquo;s name is nothing more than a bedtime story for children because of the throne you want to sit on. I want nothing to do with the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to live the rest of my life in peace.&rdquo; The Savage declares only inches away from the so-called queen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running and fighting my whole life. I don&rsquo;t want to die that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After I am named Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, I will provide you safety to live the rest of your life in peace. I promise you that.&rdquo; Daenerys offers an emotional expression, &ldquo;But you have to stand by me and fight for me until I&rsquo;m named Queen of Westeros.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo; The woman states while throwing the chain beside Daenerys, &ldquo;Now takes this bloody chain off me.&rdquo;</p><p>The two men behind their Queen looks at the women in fear and move to attack position. Taking a deep breath Daenerys goes to the chain around the woman&rsquo;s neck and unlocks it. It falls to the ground and makes a loud shattering sound against the rocks. The Savage look down at it in shock of it actually coming off like that. She&rsquo;s spent years trying to take it off and trying to break it. Rubbing her neck she turns to Daenerys in disbelief that it came off that fast. The woman then pops her neck and shoulders from finally having that weight lifted off from her. Smiling wildly the Savage feels her blood pumping excitedly. She&rsquo;s ready to get out of the godforsaken cave and see the light again. Daenerys holds in a smile from seeing the woman&rsquo;s reaction before asking.</p><p>&ldquo;So tell me. What is your first name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Emilia.&rdquo; She announces with pride of who she is, &ldquo;Emilia Savage, last of my name, outlawed and exiled from Westeros, Princess of the forest, Goddess of Nature, and once ruler of the fallen Kingdom of Savages.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s journey until we reach Westeros\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When we reach Dragonstone we&rsquo;ll have one night of rest. Next morning we&rsquo;ll begin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Emilia all day\u2026&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister, a man who always repays his debts, informs his traveling companions until he notices one missing and blurts out, &ldquo;Has anyone seen Lady Savage?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, please.&rdquo; Missandei speaks up with a playful smile before looking at the morning sky, &ldquo;How could you miss her?&rdquo;</p><p>With that said Tyrion rolls his eyes and looks up to see that Missandei is true to her words. Grey Worm, the Commander of the unsullied, grins before looking up to the ship&rsquo;s deck with his hands behind his back. Lord Varys sighs like he&rsquo;s the father of a bunch of children before too looking up to see where Emilia is. Only Daenerys Targaryen keeps looking straight ahead, she doesn&rsquo;t move a single muscle as she sees Dragonstone come into view. Seeing it forces her to smile and let out a shaky breath, she&rsquo;s so close yet so far away. After a moment the Mother of Dragons finally looks up to see her three babies and Emilia. Her three dragons soared in the air like they owned it, their wings were out for the world to see and they roar as loud as they like. The fourth dragon is in front of them all flying like it&rsquo;s on a mission. The scales we&rsquo;re forest green, they&rsquo;re so bright that it could blind a man when the sun touches them. Her wings soar in the air like no others have seen, she&rsquo;ll be at Dragonstone before anyone. Daenerys walks to the bow of the ship smiling before telling everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Emilia&rsquo;s ready to get off this bloody ship just as much as me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon you&rsquo;re grace.&rdquo; Lord Varys speaks up while saying lightly, &ldquo;But Lady Savage as barely been on this ship since we got on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes\u2026&rdquo; She looks down at her shoes grinning away, &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dany, I must warn you.&rdquo; Tyrion goes to stand by his Queen, &ldquo;When people find out that you not only brought three dragons but woman from legends they will fear everything else you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; She lifts her head up high with her hands entwined in front of her, &ldquo;I accept that challenge, I&rsquo;ll show the world they should not fear something their ancestors told them to fear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; When my father told my family the story about the Savages he told it like they were the villains. Like they were the monsters of the world.&rdquo; Tyrion looks up to the Dragon turning into an eagle, &ldquo;Seeing her in the flesh\u2026 Makes me wonder how he could tell the story so wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I met her. She told me every story told about her family is a little different.&rdquo; Daenerys looks to her second hand and declares, &ldquo;I plan to tell the world the real story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful idea but can it be done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One look at her and they&rsquo;ll know everything they were told was a lie.&rdquo;</p>",

Tell us again!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTell you what again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe legend of the Forest Princess, of course.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a story, Ayra. Not a legend.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSame thing!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward Stark, the warden of the North, chuckles at his two little girls banter while he quietly sips his soup. The entire Stark family\u2019s eating dinner in the dining hall on a long wooden table in front of the fireplace like any other night. His wife, Catelyn Stark, sends him a look across the dinner table from seeing her daughters fighting once again. They always fight and Edward is always no help when trying to dissolve it. Rickon Stark, who\u2019s barely a year old, begins to cry from the commotion. Robb and Bran Stark look at one another with an awkward gaze before trying to finish their food to leave the table. Sansa then ignores the argument she started with her little sister before asking her father.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFather\u2026 Please\u2026 Tell us. One more time.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on.\u201d Ayra speaks up, the argument forgotten, with a pouting expression, \u201cIt\u2019s our favorite story.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell it to me this time.\u201d Eddard Stark sighs while leaning back in his seat, \u201cI\u2019m awfully tired.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut you tell it better. You haven\u2019t told it in forever.\u201d Sansa points out while playing with her food, \u201cEveryone here wants to hear it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The head of the table asks innocently while looking at his children. The girls nod instantly, they\u2019re practically bouncing in their seats. They ask to hear the story at least once a week. The boys, Robb and Bran, look at him with a guilty expression making him realize they too would like to hear it. The boys never admit it but the story was one of their favorites too, it always seemed so real when their father told it to them. Turning to Catelyn she sends him a tired expression, she didn\u2019t care what he talked about. She just wanted them to stop fighting and the baby to stay asleep. After looking at each one of them he looks up and across the room to a child sitting by himself near their table. His bastard son, Jon Snow, sits alone at a table near theirs so he\u2019s able to listen to their conversation. He\u2019s been listening and watching as he ate his dinner. When seeing his father looks his way he looks down to his food quickly so it seems like he\u2019s just been peacefully eating. Sighing Edward looks back at his kids and nods before asking as if he didn\u2019t know the answer.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo what story do you children want to hear again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know which one we want to hear.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere are just so many stories\u2026\u201d Edward groans before looking over at Jon and saying, \u201cDo you know the story they\u2019re talking about, boy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Princess of the Forest Kingdom.\u201d Jon coughs out nervously while glancing their way, \u201c\u2026 Right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes! Jon, yes!\u201d Ayra shrieks while grinning excitedly, \u201cThat\u2019s the one. Oh, please tell it, father.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. Fine\u2026 Someone help me start it.\u201d Edward leans back in his seat before asking, \u201cCatelyn, darling?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was a long, long time ago.\u201d She says dramatically making the children grin, \u201cBack when the Targaryen family ruled the seven kingdoms and full grown thirsty dragons ruled the sky. There was a kingdom, no common man knew of it\u2026 Honey?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was a Kingdom made of the forest.\u201d Edward continues the story with as much enthusiasm as his wife, \u201cEvery forest, land, mountain, ocean, lake, and river was connected as one big kingdom called\u2026 \u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTHE KINGDOM OF SAVAGES.\u201d Ayra and Sansa scream on the top of their lungs.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCorrect.\u201d Edward chuckles while his wife sighs from their yelling before he adds, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a Kingdom of Savage men and women though. It was a kingdom of savage animals. Any animal you can think of was a part of that kingdom. All the dragons, birds, lizards, wolves, all animals lived in the Kingdom. However, it wasn\u2019t ruled by animals. The kingdom was ruled by a King and Queen, but not by just any King and Queen. It wasn\u2019t any Targaryen or Barrathon or even any mortal man on the throne that we know of. It was the Savage family.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Savages?\u201d Catelyn snorts while closing her eyes, \u201cWhat an original name.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a real house name, The Savages. Just like it was a real kingdom, a long time ago.\u201d Edward snaps as he sends his wife a look to not ruin the story, \u201cThe Savage family were far more priceless than gold, any land, or even a single dragon.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA dragon?\u201d Bran whispers with his food completely forgotten, \u201cHow are they more priceless than a dragon? They\u2019re extinct now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause they could transform into dragons.\u201d Edward leans on the table with a voice that held true secrets, \u201cThey could turn into any animal they wanted at any time. That\u2019s why they were the Kings and Queens of the forest. They were the only ones who could understand or control the wild creatures in the forests\u2026 For centuries the Savages ruled over the forest by being a dragon or a lion or any animal for that matter.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat about the princess?\u201d Arya speaks up loudly before adding, \u201cFather tell us about the Princess of the forest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m getting to it child.\u201d Edward laughs before giving his youngest daughter a smile, \u201cThe only people who knew about the kingdom were the animals living there and the royal family of the seven kingdoms, the Targaryens. They would visit one another often discussing anything that had to do with ruling their kingdoms. They did this without telling anyone, but people listen and rumors spread. One day they decided it was time for the world to know about the Kingdom of Savages. Along with that decision, came a promise. A promise to unite the kingdoms with marriage. They had a vision of all living things being ruled under one King and Queen. So they promised that the next Savage daughter would marry the King of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFor many years,\u201d Catelyn speaks up wanting to tell this part of the story, \u201cThe Savage family only had sons. No daughters.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUntil finally,\u201d Edward raises an eyebrow and smiles softly, \u201cThey did.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLast time you told us this story you said she never did marry the King.\u201d Robb speaks up curiously as his mind skips ahead in the story, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, when they had their daughter they finally told the people of the seven kingdoms about the Kingdom of Savages along with the Royal family\u2019s ability to transform into animals.\u201d Edward answers seriously forgetting for a moment it was supposed to be just a bedtime story, \u201cAs more and more people learned about them the more people began to fear them. When people are afraid\u2026 they do unforgivable things.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Catelyn looks up at her husband with a warning expression. He was getting very close to the true history and not a fake legend. All the kids were hanging on every word he said though. They\u2019ve all heard this story a million times, but every time they heard it they felt like it was the first. Their father always told it as if it was real as if he was there when it happened. They know it isn\u2019t though, how can anyone change from a person to a dragon? Looking around the table Edward eyes lands on Jon at the back table. Jon was looking at his food but his father knew better, he knows Jon\u2019s listening to every word of the story. With his eyes still on him, he continues the story.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Savages daughter, when born, was known all over the world as the Princess of the Forest. Some even called her the Goddess of the forest. Everyone loved her but as she got older people began to realize she too had her parents gift. At the time people were scared at the fact they could transform into animals. They thought it was witchcraft and dark magic. It didn\u2019t take long for the people to fear her being their Queen. They didn\u2019t want someone with power like that on a throne. So a group of people planned to kill every member of the Savage house. They killed everyone in her family and she was next on their list to murder but before they could she disappeared.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean disappear?\u201d Bran blurts out angrily, \u201cShe can\u2019t just disappear! She\u2019s royalty.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHer family let the group kill them so she could escape and leave to Essos.\u201d Edward says in a low mysterious voice but at the end of his sentence, he turns to look at Jon seriously before finishing his story, \u201cLegend has it\u2026 That she\u2019s in Essos at this very moment. Waiting. For the Prince she was promised to crown her Queen the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</i></p><p><b>DURING ROBERT BARATHEON\u2019S REBELLION</b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s her, that\u2019s the last Savage.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing Robert wants her alive but if you must kill her. By all means, kill her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The ship was sinking faster with every second that past, most of the crew is lying dead on their own ship. More brutal soldiers came into view of the last Savage as she tried to take cover for her life. She was almost across the sea to Essos when ships from the Seven Kingdoms found the one she happens to be aboard. Emilia Savage, the last of her name, only 16 years of age runs to the end of the ship with soldiers following after her. It\u2019s pitch black and the rain hit harder than the waves but that didn\u2019t stop anyone from going after the Savage girl. Stopping Emilia\u2019s in the corner of the very edge of the ship, looking at the running soldiers she leans off the bow. Her hair and clothes cling onto her body, her breath is uncontrollably loud but that\u2019s the last of her worries. The king has wanted her head since the war started, now the fight is over and his soldiers have finally found her. The Captain of the ships who attacked the one she\u2019s on comes to stand in front of her only a few feet away before yelling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLady Emilia Savage, A Princess Of The Forest, traitor, Exiled and outlawed from the Seven Kingdoms, you are under arrest for the crimes against the new king, Robert Baratheon.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat crimes have I committed?\u201d Emilia shouts through the rain while glancing down at the untamed sea, \u201cMy family has done nothing but give loyalty to the throne!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour family\u2019s loyalty is to the mad King!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s to the forest! Nature! The Seven Kingdoms know this!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen why did you run? Lady Savage, we are no fools.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRobert Baratheon executed my parents because of the rumors and bedtime stories!\u201d She cries out in agony while looking for an escape, \u201cWould you have me believe he wouldn\u2019t do the same for me!?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe would have spared any child\u2019s life, not yours after running. Now. Men, arrest her!\u201d</i></p><p><i>The nameless Captain orders without giving her any more reasons to her arrest. She begins panicking knowing if they capture her, her death will not be with any mercy. Her parents weren\u2019t given a clean death, why would she? Soldiers begin coming towards her, one grabs her wrist and she backhands him. He steps back in shock before moving to hit her but he never gets the chance to. Emilia pushes herself off the edge before anyone else can lay another hand on her. She falls into the sea and all the Soldiers run to the edge to see where she\u2019s at. They see the forest green cloak that she was wearing only seconds before she fell floating up with no body attached. A soldier turns to his Captain after a moment of no sign of her and yells.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCapt'n, we can\u2019t possibly find her in this weather!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLook!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Another soldier blurts out making the Captain go to the edge of the ship. All the men look around curiously trying to find the reason to the man\u2019s single request. The men stand searching for a few moments and start to believe there\u2019s nothing to look at when a flash of red comes to their eyes. At first, they all think its blood, the blood of the last Savage, but as they all stare at it they realize the red isn\u2019t blood but scales. Red scales shimmer in the moonlight under the water making everyone on the ship look as if they\u2019ve seen a ghost. The red turns into green scales that flip out from the sea and let the soldiers see that the scales are a huge tail of a shark. Well, not a shark but the shape of one, no shark has ever been bright red or green. The tail goes back into the water as quickly as it came out and disappears into the deep blue. After a second of shock, all the men turn to their Captain in hope that he will tell them was is behind this madness. Shaking his head at seeing the impossible the ship\u2019s Captain announces.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Last Savage is dead. She died on her way to Essos, her body drowned in the sea.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Cap-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we clear?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</i></p><p><i>All the soldiers shout as one before following their captain back to their own ships. They don\u2019t know what to make of what they saw in the water, how could they? They didn\u2019t see Emilia\u2019s body but instead a tail that changed from red to green. The Captain walks back to his ship more stressed than when he left it. How is he supposed to explain this to his King? He wasn\u2019t though, he wasn\u2019t going to tell the truth of this because the truth was nearly impossible. Two soldiers still linger by the bow, however, they look down at the cloak in the water. One then looks up at the other thinking like a madman before whispering to the other in complete bewilderness.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe that was-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, can\u2019t be.\u201d The other soldier automatically says knowing what his friend\u2019s thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe was named a princess of the forest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s just a name. Plus this is the sea, not the forest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA forest can be under the sea though.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat rumor you think of isn\u2019t real.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen why kill her?\u201d</i></p><hr><p>\u201cDid I hear the Dothraki correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026 Apparently, they found a Goddess living in the caves.\u201d</p><p>Jorah Mormont answers truly confused as they follow their Queen down the narrow cave. Daenerys Targaryen, true Queen of Westeros, follows two Dothraki soldiers with torches down a cave they can\u2019t see the end of it. Behind her are her most trusted friends and allies, Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis. Behind the two men were three more Dothraki. The cave is right below when the Dothraki live, it\u2019s pitch black and rocky in every place imaginable. The Dothraki wanted to leave with the Dragon Queen but refuse to go unless their hidden Goddess came with them. They found her when they came here and haven\u2019t left this place since. The three of them have no idea what they were talking about, there was no such thing as a real Goddess. If so how could she be under here for so long? As they continue to follow the soldiers Jorah says more to himself out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt explains why they\u2019ve made this here resting place for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made it clear they wouldn\u2019t leave with me unless the Goddess came along.\u201d Their Queen, Daenerys Taryegan, points out as the Dothraki soldiers show her the way to the cave, \u201cThey believe it\u2019s will bring bad luck to them all if we leave her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this so-called Goddess, anyway?\u201d Daario snaps with an awkward chuckle, \u201cShe can\u2019t be that powerful if she\u2019s trapped in a cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said She\u2019s the Goddess of\u2026The Forest or Nature, I think.\u201d The Mother of Dragon thinks out loud before asking, \u201cRight, Jorah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. They said nature but that could mean a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>One of the Dothraki speaks up using his original tongue.</p><p>\u201cHe says we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>When reaching the end of the rock narrow cave a huge dome appears. The Dothraki men stop walking at the edge, one hands the torch to Daenerys and the other hands it to Daario. The three look at one another worried since just that action alone lets them know the soldier will not be following them any longer. The three slowly walk out into the big dome, they look anywhere for any sign of life. The men go in front of Daenerys at they walk further into the cave but stop when hearing a chain move against the rock floor. They wave their torches to find where the sound came from. The chain sound fills the room once more before the sound of a growl or takes the sound. Suddenly fire fills the air letting the three see a dragon in the flames. They all back up in shock, it wasn\u2019t possible. Dragons only became existing a few months ago by Daenerys, how could one be under here.</p><p>The fire the dragon breathed out lights torches all around the cave that the Dothraki must have put up. The three cover their eyes from how bright the room has became only to see a glimpse of the Dragon shrinking into a human body. The cave is now completely light up, it\u2019s much bigger than they thought it was in full light. In the center of it was a woman with a chain around her neck. The chain was long but not long enough to reach where the three were standing. The woman has long dark brown hair with only a simple slave dress on. Daenerys walks past the men to get a closer look at her. She\u2019s never seen this woman before but she doesn\u2019t look from Essos. People in Essos usually have tan skin and deep dark from hair with familiar faces. Her face looks different, her skin was lighter than people born in Essos. Coming a little closer to the woman Daenerys ask loudly.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Goddess of Nature to the Dothraki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She says with her voice slightly shaken, \u201cBut what is your birth name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess of the Forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re house name.\u201d Jorah then asks more precisely, \u201cWhat is your house name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavage?\u201d Daario asks as if he heard it correctly, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have.\u201d Daenery says in complete shock, \u201cMy brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The woman begins laughing slowly while sitting in the center of the cave, \u201cSo you\u2019ve heard that bedtime story.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys eyes are wide from thinking back to when she was only a child. Visery used to tell her a story in their studies about a Kingdom of Savages. It was a kingdom only made up of wild beasts ruled by a human and an animal. He said it was the kingdom of all forests the Savage house ruled over. Apparently, the Targaryen house adored them, loved them like their own family. The seven kingdoms didn\u2019t though, they feared them and wanted nothing to do with a King and Queen that could be human and a beast. Viserys told her the day all the dragons died the Savage house did too. It was always some made up legend when he told her the story. She vaguely remembers the story he told her but she\u2019ll never forget the name Savages. Coming closer to the woman Daenery asks cautiously,</p><p>\u201cWas it true? The Kingdom, the family, the deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery story told about my family is a little different.\u201d She mumbles without looking their way, \u201cThe kingdom was real, the family was real, all the deaths were real\u2026 but one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>The mother of Dragons breathes out in shock while coming even closer. She remembers Visery saying the family died along with all the dragons. He must not have known about this woman, about her surviving. Then again he never told her about how many were in the Savage family, he always talked about them as one thing. The two women, neither one born in Essos, were in Dothraki clothing standing inside a cave almost as big as a castle. The Savage woman sits with a chain around her neck that connected to the middle of the rocky cave. Kneeling down Daenerys looks at the chain and finds words embedded in a language she can not read. The chain must be rare enough not to be able to broke it with any weapon or fire, someone must have made this chain for people who were less than a god but more than a man. The last Targaryen stares at the woman in rare chains for a moment before asking.</p><p>\u201cCan these chains come off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone can take it off beside the person wearing it.\u201d The woman answers while standing up and turning to her, \u201cWould you dare take it off me? You\u2019ve heard the stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare say yes.\u201d Daenerys smiles before waving her hands around and saying in surprise, \u201cIf you help me take back the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany.\u201d Jorah speaks up in warning while taking a step closer, \u201cShe was a dragon moments before. Take it off her and who knows what she\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d The woman growls with a smirk while she starts walking toward them, \u201cI can turn into any animal I want to at any time. Westeros feared my family because of it, Baratheon killed my family and exiled me because of it. The people who chained me up years ago feared me because of it. So tell me, why dare set me free when I am nothing but feared by many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Targaryen, the last of my name.\u201d Daenerys announces while reaching the woman, \u201cIn my family, we don\u2019t fear a gift, we embrace it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we know she will stay true to her words?\u201d Daario then asks from where he\u2019s standing, \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a reason behind her being exiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll stay true to her word, that\u2019s all a princess knows how to do.\u201d The Mother of Dragon says as if she\u2019s talking about herself before looking the woman in her eyes and saying in raw emotion, \u201cFight for me, Savage, help me take back the throne. I will restore your family\u2019s name and honor them the way they should have. I will give you your freedom back when all this is said and done. We will restore-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I care about my family\u2019s honor?\u201d The outlaw spits out in the chains holding her, \u201cMy family\u2019s name is nothing more than a bedtime story for children because of the throne you want to sit on. I want nothing to do with the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to live the rest of my life in peace.\u201d The Savage declares only inches away from the so-called queen, \u201cI\u2019ve been running and fighting my whole life. I don\u2019t want to die that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I am named Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, I will provide you safety to live the rest of your life in peace. I promise you that.\u201d Daenerys offers an emotional expression, \u201cBut you have to stand by me and fight for me until I\u2019m named Queen of Westeros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d The woman states while throwing the chain beside Daenerys, \u201cNow takes this bloody chain off me.\u201d</p><p>The two men behind their Queen looks at the women in fear and move to attack position. Taking a deep breath Daenerys goes to the chain around the woman\u2019s neck and unlocks it. It falls to the ground and makes a loud shattering sound against the rocks. The Savage look down at it in shock of it actually coming off like that. She\u2019s spent years trying to take it off and trying to break it. Rubbing her neck she turns to Daenerys in disbelief that it came off that fast. The woman then pops her neck and shoulders from finally having that weight lifted off from her. Smiling wildly the Savage feels her blood pumping excitedly. She\u2019s ready to get out of the godforsaken cave and see the light again. Daenerys holds in a smile from seeing the woman\u2019s reaction before asking.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me. What is your first name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilia.\u201d She announces with pride of who she is, \u201cEmilia Savage, last of my name, outlawed and exiled from Westeros, Princess of the forest, Goddess of Nature, and once ruler of the fallen Kingdom of Savages.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a day\u2019s journey until we reach Westeros\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we reach Dragonstone we\u2019ll have one night of rest. Next morning we\u2019ll begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Emilia all day\u2026\u201d Tyrion Lannister, a man who always repays his debts, informs his traveling companions until he notices one missing and blurts out, \u201cHas anyone seen Lady Savage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d Missandei speaks up with a playful smile before looking at the morning sky, \u201cHow could you miss her?\u201d</p><p>With that said Tyrion rolls his eyes and looks up to see that Missandei is true to her words. Grey Worm, the Commander of the unsullied, grins before looking up to the ship\u2019s deck with his hands behind his back. Lord Varys sighs like he\u2019s the father of a bunch of children before too looking up to see where Emilia is. Only Daenerys Targaryen keeps looking straight ahead, she doesn\u2019t move a single muscle as she sees Dragonstone come into view. Seeing it forces her to smile and let out a shaky breath, she\u2019s so close yet so far away. After a moment the Mother of Dragons finally looks up to see her three babies and Emilia. Her three dragons soared in the air like they owned it, their wings were out for the world to see and they roar as loud as they like. The fourth dragon is in front of them all flying like it\u2019s on a mission. The scales we\u2019re forest green, they\u2019re so bright that it could blind a man when the sun touches them. Her wings soar in the air like no others have seen, she\u2019ll be at Dragonstone before anyone. Daenerys walks to the bow of the ship smiling before telling everyone.</p><p>\u201cEmilia\u2019s ready to get off this bloody ship just as much as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon you\u2019re grace.\u201d Lord Varys speaks up while saying lightly, \u201cBut Lady Savage as barely been on this ship since we got on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d She looks down at her shoes grinning away, \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany, I must warn you.\u201d Tyrion goes to stand by his Queen, \u201cWhen people find out that you not only brought three dragons but woman from legends they will fear everything else you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She lifts her head up high with her hands entwined in front of her, \u201cI accept that challenge, I\u2019ll show the world they should not fear something their ancestors told them to fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 When my father told my family the story about the Savages he told it like they were the villains. Like they were the monsters of the world.\u201d Tyrion looks up to the Dragon turning into an eagle, \u201cSeeing her in the flesh\u2026 Makes me wonder how he could tell the story so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I met her. She told me every story told about her family is a little different.\u201d Daenerys looks to her second hand and declares, \u201cI plan to tell the world the real story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful idea but can it be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne look at her and they\u2019ll know everything they were told was a lie.\u201d</p></p>",

He had risen from the dead, she transformed into a dragon. He wasn\u2019t just another bastard anymore, he was the prince who was promised.

Not a legend.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSame thing!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Edward Stark, the warden of the North, chuckles at his two little girls banter while he quietly sips his soup. The entire Stark family\u2019s eating dinner in the dining hall on a long wooden table in front of the fireplace like any other night. His wife, Catelyn Stark, sends him a look across the dinner table from seeing her daughters fighting once again. They always fight and Edward is always no help when trying to dissolve it. Rickon Stark, who\u2019s barely a year old, begins to cry from the commotion. Robb and Bran Stark look at one another with an awkward gaze before trying to finish their food to leave the table. Sansa then ignores the argument she started with her little sister before asking her father.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFather\u2026 Please\u2026 Tell us. One more time.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on.\u201d Ayra speaks up, the argument forgotten, with a pouting expression, \u201cIt\u2019s our favorite story.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell it to me this time.\u201d Eddard Stark sighs while leaning back in his seat, \u201cI\u2019m awfully tired.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut you tell it better. You haven\u2019t told it in forever.\u201d Sansa points out while playing with her food, \u201cEveryone here wants to hear it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The head of the table asks innocently while looking at his children. The girls nod instantly, they\u2019re practically bouncing in their seats. They ask to hear the story at least once a week. The boys, Robb and Bran, look at him with a guilty expression making him realize they too would like to hear it. The boys never admit it but the story was one of their favorites too, it always seemed so real when their father told it to them. Turning to Catelyn she sends him a tired expression, she didn\u2019t care what he talked about. She just wanted them to stop fighting and the baby to stay asleep. After looking at each one of them he looks up and across the room to a child sitting by himself near their table. His bastard son, Jon Snow, sits alone at a table near theirs so he\u2019s able to listen to their conversation. He\u2019s been listening and watching as he ate his dinner. When seeing his father looks his way he looks down to his food quickly so it seems like he\u2019s just been peacefully eating. Sighing Edward looks back at his kids and nods before asking as if he didn\u2019t know the answer.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo what story do you children want to hear again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know which one we want to hear.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere are just so many stories\u2026\u201d Edward groans before looking over at Jon and saying, \u201cDo you know the story they\u2019re talking about, boy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Princess of the Forest Kingdom.\u201d Jon coughs out nervously while glancing their way, \u201c\u2026 Right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes!

Fine\u2026 Someone help me start it.\u201d Edward leans back in his seat before asking, \u201cCatelyn, darling?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was a long, long time ago.\u201d She says dramatically making the children grin, \u201cBack when the Targaryen family ruled the seven kingdoms and full grown thirsty dragons ruled the sky. There was a kingdom, no common man knew of it\u2026 Honey?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was a Kingdom made of the forest.\u201d Edward continues the story with as much enthusiasm as his wife, \u201cEvery forest, land, mountain, ocean, lake, and river was connected as one big kingdom called\u2026 \u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTHE KINGDOM OF SAVAGES.\u201d Ayra and Sansa scream on the top of their lungs.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCorrect.\u201d Edward chuckles while his wife sighs from their yelling before he adds, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a Kingdom of Savage men and women though. It was a kingdom of savage animals. Any animal you can think of was a part of that kingdom. All the dragons, birds, lizards, wolves, all animals lived in the Kingdom. However, it wasn\u2019t ruled by animals. The kingdom was ruled by a King and Queen, but not by just any King and Queen. It wasn\u2019t any Targaryen or Barrathon or even any mortal man on the throne that we know of. It was the Savage family.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Savages?\u201d Catelyn snorts while closing her eyes, \u201cWhat an original name.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a real house name, The Savages. Just like it was a real kingdom, a long time ago.\u201d Edward snaps as he sends his wife a look to not ruin the story, \u201cThe Savage family were far more priceless than gold, any land, or even a single dragon.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA dragon?\u201d Bran whispers with his food completely forgotten, \u201cHow are they more priceless than a dragon? They\u2019re extinct now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause they could transform into dragons.\u201d Edward leans on the table with a voice that held true secrets, \u201cThey could turn into any animal they wanted at any time. That\u2019s why they were the Kings and Queens of the forest. They were the only ones who could understand or control the wild creatures in the forests\u2026 For centuries the Savages ruled over the forest by being a dragon or a lion or any animal for that matter.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat about the princess?\u201d Arya speaks up loudly before adding, \u201cFather tell us about the Princess of the forest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m getting to it child.\u201d Edward laughs before giving his youngest daughter a smile, \u201cThe only people who knew about the kingdom were the animals living there and the royal family of the seven kingdoms, the Targaryens. They would visit one another often discussing anything that had to do with ruling their kingdoms. They did this without telling anyone, but people listen and rumors spread. One day they decided it was time for the world to know about the Kingdom of Savages. Along with that decision, came a promise. A promise to unite the kingdoms with marriage. They had a vision of all living things being ruled under one King and Queen. So they promised that the next Savage daughter would marry the King of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFor many years,\u201d Catelyn speaks up wanting to tell this part of the story, \u201cThe Savage family only had sons. No daughters.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUntil finally,\u201d Edward raises an eyebrow and smiles softly, \u201cThey did.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLast time you told us this story you said she never did marry the King.\u201d Robb speaks up curiously as his mind skips ahead in the story, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, when they had their daughter they finally told the people of the seven kingdoms about the Kingdom of Savages along with the Royal family\u2019s ability to transform into animals.\u201d Edward answers seriously forgetting for a moment it was supposed to be just a bedtime story, \u201cAs more and more people learned about them the more people began to fear them. When people are afraid\u2026 they do unforgivable things.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Catelyn looks up at her husband with a warning expression. He was getting very close to the true history and not a fake legend. All the kids were hanging on every word he said though. They\u2019ve all heard this story a million times, but every time they heard it they felt like it was the first. Their father always told it as if it was real as if he was there when it happened. They know it isn\u2019t though, how can anyone change from a person to a dragon? Looking around the table Edward eyes lands on Jon at the back table. Jon was looking at his food but his father knew better, he knows Jon\u2019s listening to every word of the story. With his eyes still on him, he continues the story.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Savages daughter, when born, was known all over the world as the Princess of the Forest. Some even called her the Goddess of the forest. Everyone loved her but as she got older people began to realize she too had her parents gift. At the time people were scared at the fact they could transform into animals. They thought it was witchcraft and dark magic. It didn\u2019t take long for the people to fear her being their Queen. They didn\u2019t want someone with power like that on a throne. So a group of people planned to kill every member of the Savage house. They killed everyone in her family and she was next on their list to murder but before they could she disappeared.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean disappear?\u201d Bran blurts out angrily, \u201cShe can\u2019t just disappear! She\u2019s royalty.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHer family let the group kill them so she could escape and leave to Essos.\u201d Edward says in a low mysterious voice but at the end of his sentence, he turns to look at Jon seriously before finishing his story, \u201cLegend has it\u2026 That she\u2019s in Essos at this very moment. Waiting. For the Prince she was promised to crown her Queen the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</i></p><p><b>DURING ROBERT BARATHEON\u2019S REBELLION</b></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s her, that\u2019s the last Savage.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing Robert wants her alive but if you must kill her. By all means, kill her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The ship was sinking faster with every second that past, most of the crew is lying dead on their own ship. More brutal soldiers came into view of the last Savage as she tried to take cover for her life. She was almost across the sea to Essos when ships from the Seven Kingdoms found the one she happens to be aboard. Emilia Savage, the last of her name, only 16 years of age runs to the end of the ship with soldiers following after her. It\u2019s pitch black and the rain hit harder than the waves but that didn\u2019t stop anyone from going after the Savage girl. Stopping Emilia\u2019s in the corner of the very edge of the ship, looking at the running soldiers she leans off the bow. Her hair and clothes cling onto her body, her breath is uncontrollably loud but that\u2019s the last of her worries. The king has wanted her head since the war started, now the fight is over and his soldiers have finally found her. The Captain of the ships who attacked the one she\u2019s on comes to stand in front of her only a few feet away before yelling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLady Emilia Savage, A Princess Of The Forest, traitor, Exiled and outlawed from the Seven Kingdoms, you are under arrest for the crimes against the new king, Robert Baratheon.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat crimes have I committed?\u201d Emilia shouts through the rain while glancing down at the untamed sea, \u201cMy family has done nothing but give loyalty to the throne!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour family\u2019s loyalty is to the mad King!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s to the forest! Nature! The Seven Kingdoms know this!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen why did you run? Lady Savage, we are no fools.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRobert Baratheon executed my parents because of the rumors and bedtime stories!\u201d She cries out in agony while looking for an escape, \u201cWould you have me believe he wouldn\u2019t do the same for me!?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe would have spared any child\u2019s life, not yours after running. Now. Men, arrest her!\u201d</i></p><p><i>The nameless Captain orders without giving her any more reasons to her arrest. She begins panicking knowing if they capture her, her death will not be with any mercy. Her parents weren\u2019t given a clean death, why would she? Soldiers begin coming towards her, one grabs her wrist and she backhands him. He steps back in shock before moving to hit her but he never gets the chance to. Emilia pushes herself off the edge before anyone else can lay another hand on her. She falls into the sea and all the Soldiers run to the edge to see where she\u2019s at. They see the forest green cloak that she was wearing only seconds before she fell floating up with no body attached. A soldier turns to his Captain after a moment of no sign of her and yells.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCapt'n, we can\u2019t possibly find her in this weather!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLook!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Another soldier blurts out making the Captain go to the edge of the ship. All the men look around curiously trying to find the reason to the man\u2019s single request. The men stand searching for a few moments and start to believe there\u2019s nothing to look at when a flash of red comes to their eyes. At first, they all think its blood, the blood of the last Savage, but as they all stare at it they realize the red isn\u2019t blood but scales. Red scales shimmer in the moonlight under the water making everyone on the ship look as if they\u2019ve seen a ghost. The red turns into green scales that flip out from the sea and let the soldiers see that the scales are a huge tail of a shark. Well, not a shark but the shape of one, no shark has ever been bright red or green. The tail goes back into the water as quickly as it came out and disappears into the deep blue. After a second of shock, all the men turn to their Captain in hope that he will tell them was is behind this madness. Shaking his head at seeing the impossible the ship\u2019s Captain announces.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Last Savage is dead. She died on her way to Essos, her body drowned in the sea.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Cap-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre we clear?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</i></p><p><i>All the soldiers shout as one before following their captain back to their own ships. They don\u2019t know what to make of what they saw in the water, how could they? They didn\u2019t see Emilia\u2019s body but instead a tail that changed from red to green. The Captain walks back to his ship more stressed than when he left it. How is he supposed to explain this to his King? He wasn\u2019t though, he wasn\u2019t going to tell the truth of this because the truth was nearly impossible. Two soldiers still linger by the bow, however, they look down at the cloak in the water. One then looks up at the other thinking like a madman before whispering to the other in complete bewilderness.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe that was-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, can\u2019t be.\u201d The other soldier automatically says knowing what his friend\u2019s thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe was named a princess of the forest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s just a name. Plus this is the sea, not the forest.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA forest can be under the sea though.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat rumor you think of isn\u2019t real.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen why kill her?\u201d</i></p><hr><p>\u201cDid I hear the Dothraki correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026 Apparently, they found a Goddess living in the caves.\u201d</p><p>Jorah Mormont answers truly confused as they follow their Queen down the narrow cave. Daenerys Targaryen, true Queen of Westeros, follows two Dothraki soldiers with torches down a cave they can\u2019t see the end of it. Behind her are her most trusted friends and allies, Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis. Behind the two men were three more Dothraki. The cave is right below when the Dothraki live, it\u2019s pitch black and rocky in every place imaginable. The Dothraki wanted to leave with the Dragon Queen but refuse to go unless their hidden Goddess came with them. They found her when they came here and haven\u2019t left this place since. The three of them have no idea what they were talking about, there was no such thing as a real Goddess. If so how could she be under here for so long? As they continue to follow the soldiers Jorah says more to himself out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt explains why they\u2019ve made this here resting place for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey made it clear they wouldn\u2019t leave with me unless the Goddess came along.\u201d Their Queen, Daenerys Taryegan, points out as the Dothraki soldiers show her the way to the cave, \u201cThey believe it\u2019s will bring bad luck to them all if we leave her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this so-called Goddess, anyway?\u201d Daario snaps with an awkward chuckle, \u201cShe can\u2019t be that powerful if she\u2019s trapped in a cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said She\u2019s the Goddess of\u2026The Forest or Nature, I think.\u201d The Mother of Dragon thinks out loud before asking, \u201cRight, Jorah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. They said nature but that could mean a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>One of the Dothraki speaks up using his original tongue.</p><p>\u201cHe says we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>When reaching the end of the rock narrow cave a huge dome appears. The Dothraki men stop walking at the edge, one hands the torch to Daenerys and the other hands it to Daario. The three look at one another worried since just that action alone lets them know the soldier will not be following them any longer. The three slowly walk out into the big dome, they look anywhere for any sign of life. The men go in front of Daenerys at they walk further into the cave but stop when hearing a chain move against the rock floor. They wave their torches to find where the sound came from. The chain sound fills the room once more before the sound of a growl or takes the sound. Suddenly fire fills the air letting the three see a dragon in the flames. They all back up in shock, it wasn\u2019t possible. Dragons only became existing a few months ago by Daenerys, how could one be under here.</p><p>The fire the dragon breathed out lights torches all around the cave that the Dothraki must have put up. The three cover their eyes from how bright the room has became only to see a glimpse of the Dragon shrinking into a human body. The cave is now completely light up, it\u2019s much bigger than they thought it was in full light. In the center of it was a woman with a chain around her neck. The chain was long but not long enough to reach where the three were standing. The woman has long dark brown hair with only a simple slave dress on. Daenerys walks past the men to get a closer look at her. She\u2019s never seen this woman before but she doesn\u2019t look from Essos. People in Essos usually have tan skin and deep dark from hair with familiar faces. Her face looks different, her skin was lighter than people born in Essos. Coming a little closer to the woman Daenerys ask loudly.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Goddess of Nature to the Dothraki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She says with her voice slightly shaken, \u201cBut what is your birth name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess of the Forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re house name.\u201d Jorah then asks more precisely, \u201cWhat is your house name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavage?\u201d Daario asks as if he heard it correctly, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have.\u201d Daenery says in complete shock, \u201cMy brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The woman begins laughing slowly while sitting in the center of the cave, \u201cSo you\u2019ve heard that bedtime story.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys eyes are wide from thinking back to when she was only a child. Visery used to tell her a story in their studies about a Kingdom of Savages. It was a kingdom only made up of wild beasts ruled by a human and an animal. He said it was the kingdom of all forests the Savage house ruled over. Apparently, the Targaryen house adored them, loved them like their own family. The seven kingdoms didn\u2019t though, they feared them and wanted nothing to do with a King and Queen that could be human and a beast. Viserys told her the day all the dragons died the Savage house did too. It was always some made up legend when he told her the story. She vaguely remembers the story he told her but she\u2019ll never forget the name Savages. Coming closer to the woman Daenery asks cautiously,</p><p>\u201cWas it true? The Kingdom, the family, the deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery story told about my family is a little different.\u201d She mumbles without looking their way, \u201cThe kingdom was real, the family was real, all the deaths were real\u2026 but one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>The mother of Dragons breathes out in shock while coming even closer. She remembers Visery saying the family died along with all the dragons. He must not have known about this woman, about her surviving. Then again he never told her about how many were in the Savage family, he always talked about them as one thing. The two women, neither one born in Essos, were in Dothraki clothing standing inside a cave almost as big as a castle. The Savage woman sits with a chain around her neck that connected to the middle of the rocky cave. Kneeling down Daenerys looks at the chain and finds words embedded in a language she can not read. The chain must be rare enough not to be able to broke it with any weapon or fire, someone must have made this chain for people who were less than a god but more than a man. The last Targaryen stares at the woman in rare chains for a moment before asking.</p><p>\u201cCan these chains come off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone can take it off beside the person wearing it.\u201d The woman answers while standing up and turning to her, \u201cWould you dare take it off me? You\u2019ve heard the stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare say yes.\u201d Daenerys smiles before waving her hands around and saying in surprise, \u201cIf you help me take back the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany.\u201d Jorah speaks up in warning while taking a step closer, \u201cShe was a dragon moments before. Take it off her and who knows what she\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d The woman growls with a smirk while she starts walking toward them, \u201cI can turn into any animal I want to at any time. Westeros feared my family because of it, Baratheon killed my family and exiled me because of it. The people who chained me up years ago feared me because of it. So tell me, why dare set me free when I am nothing but feared by many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Targaryen, the last of my name.\u201d Daenerys announces while reaching the woman, \u201cIn my family, we don\u2019t fear a gift, we embrace it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we know she will stay true to her words?\u201d Daario then asks from where he\u2019s standing, \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a reason behind her being exiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll stay true to her word, that\u2019s all a princess knows how to do.\u201d The Mother of Dragon says as if she\u2019s talking about herself before looking the woman in her eyes and saying in raw emotion, \u201cFight for me, Savage, help me take back the throne. I will restore your family\u2019s name and honor them the way they should have. I will give you your freedom back when all this is said and done. We will restore-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I care about my family\u2019s honor?\u201d The outlaw spits out in the chains holding her, \u201cMy family\u2019s name is nothing more than a bedtime story for children because of the throne you want to sit on. I want nothing to do with the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to live the rest of my life in peace.\u201d The Savage declares only inches away from the so-called queen, \u201cI\u2019ve been running and fighting my whole life. I don\u2019t want to die that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I am named Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, I will provide you safety to live the rest of your life in peace. I promise you that.\u201d Daenerys offers an emotional expression, \u201cBut you have to stand by me and fight for me until I\u2019m named Queen of Westeros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d The woman states while throwing the chain beside Daenerys, \u201cNow takes this bloody chain off me.\u201d</p><p>The two men behind their Queen looks at the women in fear and move to attack position. Taking a deep breath Daenerys goes to the chain around the woman\u2019s neck and unlocks it. It falls to the ground and makes a loud shattering sound against the rocks. The Savage look down at it in shock of it actually coming off like that. She\u2019s spent years trying to take it off and trying to break it. Rubbing her neck she turns to Daenerys in disbelief that it came off that fast. The woman then pops her neck and shoulders from finally having that weight lifted off from her. Smiling wildly the Savage feels her blood pumping excitedly. She\u2019s ready to get out of the godforsaken cave and see the light again. Daenerys holds in a smile from seeing the woman\u2019s reaction before asking.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me. What is your first name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmilia.\u201d She announces with pride of who she is, \u201cEmilia Savage, last of my name, outlawed and exiled from Westeros, Princess of the forest, Goddess of Nature, and once ruler of the fallen Kingdom of Savages.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a day\u2019s journey until we reach Westeros\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we reach Dragonstone we\u2019ll have one night of rest. Next morning we\u2019ll begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Emilia all day\u2026\u201d Tyrion Lannister, a man who always repays his debts, informs his traveling companions until he notices one missing and blurts out, \u201cHas anyone seen Lady Savage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d Missandei speaks up with a playful smile before looking at the morning sky, \u201cHow could you miss her?\u201d</p><p>With that said Tyrion rolls his eyes and looks up to see that Missandei is true to her words. Grey Worm, the Commander of the unsullied, grins before looking up to the ship\u2019s deck with his hands behind his back. Lord Varys sighs like he\u2019s the father of a bunch of children before too looking up to see where Emilia is. Only Daenerys Targaryen keeps looking straight ahead, she doesn\u2019t move a single muscle as she sees Dragonstone come into view. Seeing it forces her to smile and let out a shaky breath, she\u2019s so close yet so far away. After a moment the Mother of Dragons finally looks up to see her three babies and Emilia. Her three dragons soared in the air like they owned it, their wings were out for the world to see and they roar as loud as they like. The fourth dragon is in front of them all flying like it\u2019s on a mission. The scales we\u2019re forest green, they\u2019re so bright that it could blind a man when the sun touches them. Her wings soar in the air like no others have seen, she\u2019ll be at Dragonstone before anyone. Daenerys walks to the bow of the ship smiling before telling everyone.</p><p>\u201cEmilia\u2019s ready to get off this bloody ship just as much as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon you\u2019re grace.\u201d Lord Varys speaks up while saying lightly, \u201cBut Lady Savage as barely been on this ship since we got on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d She looks down at her shoes grinning away, \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDany, I must warn you.\u201d Tyrion goes to stand by his Queen, \u201cWhen people find out that you not only brought three dragons but woman from legends they will fear everything else you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She lifts her head up high with her hands entwined in front of her, \u201cI accept that challenge, I\u2019ll show the world they should not fear something their ancestors told them to fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 When my father told my family the story about the Savages he told it like they were the villains. Like they were the monsters of the world.\u201d Tyrion looks up to the Dragon turning into an eagle, \u201cSeeing her in the flesh\u2026 Makes me wonder how he could tell the story so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I met her. She told me every story told about her family is a little different.\u201d Daenerys looks to her second hand and declares, \u201cI plan to tell the world the real story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful idea but can it be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne look at her and they\u2019ll know everything they were told was a lie.\u201d</p></p>",

He had risen from the dead, she transformed into a dragon. He wasn&rsquo;t just another bastard anymore, he was the prince who was promised. She was no longer an outlaw, she was the princess of the forest. When the two finally cross paths they become forever tangled in the lives of one another. History, however, reveals that the prince and the princess&rsquo;s fates have always been connected to each other. <br /></p><p><b>AFTER ROBERT BARATHEON&rsquo;S REBELLION</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, I finished my supper. Tell us again!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Tell you what again?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The legend of the Forest Princess, of course.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a story, Ayra. Not a legend.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Same thing!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Edward Stark, the warden of the North, chuckles at his two little girls banter while he quietly sips his soup. The entire Stark family&rsquo;s eating dinner in the dining hall on a long wooden table in front of the fireplace like any other night. His wife, Catelyn Stark, sends him a look across the dinner table from seeing her daughters fighting once again. They always fight and Edward is always no help when trying to dissolve it. Rickon Stark, who&rsquo;s barely a year old, begins to cry from the commotion. Robb and Bran Stark look at one another with an awkward gaze before trying to finish their food to leave the table. Sansa then ignores the argument she started with her little sister before asking her father.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Father&hellip; Please&hellip; Tell us. One more time.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Ayra speaks up, the argument forgotten, with a pouting expression, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our favorite story.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell it to me this time.&rdquo; Eddard Stark sighs while leaning back in his seat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully tired.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But you tell it better. You haven&rsquo;t told it in forever.&rdquo; Sansa points out while playing with her food, &ldquo;Everyone here wants to hear it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The head of the table asks innocently while looking at his children. The girls nod instantly, they&rsquo;re practically bouncing in their seats. They ask to hear the story at least once a week. The boys, Robb and Bran, look at him with a guilty expression making him realize they too would like to hear it. The boys never admit it but the story was one of their favorites too, it always seemed so real when their father told it to them. Turning to Catelyn she sends him a tired expression, she didn&rsquo;t care what he talked about. She just wanted them to stop fighting and the baby to stay asleep. After looking at each one of them he looks up and across the room to a child sitting by himself near their table. His bastard son, Jon Snow, sits alone at a table near theirs so he&rsquo;s able to listen to their conversation. He&rsquo;s been listening and watching as he ate his dinner. When seeing his father looks his way he looks down to his food quickly so it seems like he&rsquo;s just been peacefully eating. Sighing Edward looks back at his kids and nods before asking as if he didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So what story do you children want to hear again?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know which one we want to hear.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There are just so many stories&hellip;&rdquo; Edward groans before looking over at Jon and saying, &ldquo;Do you know the story they&rsquo;re talking about, boy?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Princess of the Forest Kingdom.&rdquo; Jon coughs out nervously while glancing their way, &ldquo;&hellip; Right?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes! Jon, yes!&rdquo; Ayra shrieks while grinning excitedly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one. Oh, please tell it, father.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fine. Fine&hellip; Someone help me start it.&rdquo; Edward leans back in his seat before asking, &ldquo;Catelyn, darling?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It was a long, long time ago.&rdquo; She says dramatically making the children grin, &ldquo;Back when the Targaryen family ruled the seven kingdoms and full grown thirsty dragons ruled the sky. There was a kingdom, no common man knew of it&hellip; Honey?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It was a Kingdom made of the forest.&rdquo; Edward continues the story with as much enthusiasm as his wife, &ldquo;Every forest, land, mountain, ocean, lake, and river was connected as one big kingdom called&hellip; &rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;THE KINGDOM OF SAVAGES.&rdquo; Ayra and Sansa scream on the top of their lungs.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo; Edward chuckles while his wife sighs from their yelling before he adds, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a Kingdom of Savage men and women though. It was a kingdom of savage animals. Any animal you can think of was a part of that kingdom. All the dragons, birds, lizards, wolves, all animals lived in the Kingdom. However, it wasn&rsquo;t ruled by animals. The kingdom was ruled by a King and Queen, but not by just any King and Queen. It wasn&rsquo;t any Targaryen or Barrathon or even any mortal man on the throne that we know of. It was the Savage family.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Savages?&rdquo; Catelyn snorts while closing her eyes, &ldquo;What an original name.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real house name, The Savages. Just like it was a real kingdom, a long time ago.&rdquo; Edward snaps as he sends his wife a look to not ruin the story, &ldquo;The Savage family were far more priceless than gold, any land, or even a single dragon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A dragon?&rdquo; Bran whispers with his food completely forgotten, &ldquo;How are they more priceless than a dragon? They&rsquo;re extinct now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Because they could transform into dragons.&rdquo; Edward leans on the table with a voice that held true secrets, &ldquo;They could turn into any animal they wanted at any time. That&rsquo;s why they were the Kings and Queens of the forest. They were the only ones who could understand or control the wild creatures in the forests&hellip; For centuries the Savages ruled over the forest by being a dragon or a lion or any animal for that matter.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What about the princess?&rdquo; Arya speaks up loudly before adding, &ldquo;Father tell us about the Princess of the forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting to it child.&rdquo; Edward laughs before giving his youngest daughter a smile, &ldquo;The only people who knew about the kingdom were the animals living there and the royal family of the seven kingdoms, the Targaryens. They would visit one another often discussing anything that had to do with ruling their kingdoms. They did this without telling anyone, but people listen and rumors spread. One day they decided it was time for the world to know about the Kingdom of Savages. Along with that decision, came a promise. A promise to unite the kingdoms with marriage. They had a vision of all living things being ruled under one King and Queen. So they promised that the next Savage daughter would marry the King of the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;For many years,&rdquo; Catelyn speaks up wanting to tell this part of the story, &ldquo;The Savage family only had sons. No daughters.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Until finally,&rdquo; Edward raises an eyebrow and smiles softly, &ldquo;They did.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Last time you told us this story you said she never did marry the King.&rdquo; Robb speaks up curiously as his mind skips ahead in the story, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, when they had their daughter they finally told the people of the seven kingdoms about the Kingdom of Savages along with the Royal family&rsquo;s ability to transform into animals.&rdquo; Edward answers seriously forgetting for a moment it was supposed to be just a bedtime story, &ldquo;As more and more people learned about them the more people began to fear them. When people are afraid&hellip; they do unforgivable things.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Catelyn looks up at her husband with a warning expression. He was getting very close to the true history and not a fake legend. All the kids were hanging on every word he said though. They&rsquo;ve all heard this story a million times, but every time they heard it they felt like it was the first. Their father always told it as if it was real as if he was there when it happened. They know it isn&rsquo;t though, how can anyone change from a person to a dragon? Looking around the table Edward eyes lands on Jon at the back table. Jon was looking at his food but his father knew better, he knows Jon&rsquo;s listening to every word of the story. With his eyes still on him, he continues the story.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Savages daughter, when born, was known all over the world as the Princess of the Forest. Some even called her the Goddess of the forest. Everyone loved her but as she got older people began to realize she too had her parents gift. At the time people were scared at the fact they could transform into animals. They thought it was witchcraft and dark magic. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the people to fear her being their Queen. They didn&rsquo;t want someone with power like that on a throne. So a group of people planned to kill every member of the Savage house. They killed everyone in her family and she was next on their list to murder but before they could she disappeared.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean disappear?&rdquo; Bran blurts out angrily, &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t just disappear! She&rsquo;s royalty.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Her family let the group kill them so she could escape and leave to Essos.&rdquo; Edward says in a low mysterious voice but at the end of his sentence, he turns to look at Jon seriously before finishing his story, &ldquo;Legend has it&hellip; That she&rsquo;s in Essos at this very moment. Waiting. For the Prince she was promised to crown her Queen the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>DURING ROBERT BARATHEON&rsquo;S REBELLION</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her, that&rsquo;s the last Savage.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;King Robert wants her alive but if you must kill her. By all means, kill her.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The ship was sinking faster with every second that past, most of the crew is lying dead on their own ship. More brutal soldiers came into view of the last Savage as she tried to take cover for her life. She was almost across the sea to Essos when ships from the Seven Kingdoms found the one she happens to be aboard. Emilia Savage, the last of her name, only 16 years of age runs to the end of the ship with soldiers following after her. It&rsquo;s pitch black and the rain hit harder than the waves but that didn&rsquo;t stop anyone from going after the Savage girl. Stopping Emilia&rsquo;s in the corner of the very edge of the ship, looking at the running soldiers she leans off the bow. Her hair and clothes cling onto her body, her breath is uncontrollably loud but that&rsquo;s the last of her worries. The king has wanted her head since the war started, now the fight is over and his soldiers have finally found her. The Captain of the ships who attacked the one she&rsquo;s on comes to stand in front of her only a few feet away before yelling.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Lady Emilia Savage, A Princess Of The Forest, traitor, Exiled and outlawed from the Seven Kingdoms, you are under arrest for the crimes against the new king, Robert Baratheon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What crimes have I committed?&rdquo; Emilia shouts through the rain while glancing down at the untamed sea, &ldquo;My family has done nothing but give loyalty to the throne!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Your family&rsquo;s loyalty is to the mad King!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to the forest! Nature! The Seven Kingdoms know this!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then why did you run? Lady Savage, we are no fools.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Robert Baratheon executed my parents because of the rumors and bedtime stories!&rdquo; She cries out in agony while looking for an escape, &ldquo;Would you have me believe he wouldn&rsquo;t do the same for me!?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He would have spared any child&rsquo;s life, not yours after running. Now. Men, arrest her!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The nameless Captain orders without giving her any more reasons to her arrest. She begins panicking knowing if they capture her, her death will not be with any mercy. Her parents weren&rsquo;t given a clean death, why would she? Soldiers begin coming towards her, one grabs her wrist and she backhands him. He steps back in shock before moving to hit her but he never gets the chance to. Emilia pushes herself off the edge before anyone else can lay another hand on her. She falls into the sea and all the Soldiers run to the edge to see where she&rsquo;s at. They see the forest green cloak that she was wearing only seconds before she fell floating up with no body attached. A soldier turns to his Captain after a moment of no sign of her and yells.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Capt'n, we can&rsquo;t possibly find her in this weather!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Another soldier blurts out making the Captain go to the edge of the ship. All the men look around curiously trying to find the reason to the man&rsquo;s single request. The men stand searching for a few moments and start to believe there&rsquo;s nothing to look at when a flash of red comes to their eyes. At first, they all think its blood, the blood of the last Savage, but as they all stare at it they realize the red isn&rsquo;t blood but scales. Red scales shimmer in the moonlight under the water making everyone on the ship look as if they&rsquo;ve seen a ghost. The red turns into green scales that flip out from the sea and let the soldiers see that the scales are a huge tail of a shark. Well, not a shark but the shape of one, no shark has ever been bright red or green. The tail goes back into the water as quickly as it came out and disappears into the deep blue. After a second of shock, all the men turn to their Captain in hope that he will tell them was is behind this madness. Shaking his head at seeing the impossible the ship&rsquo;s Captain announces.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Last Savage is dead. She died on her way to Essos, her body drowned in the sea.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But Cap-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are we clear?!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>All the soldiers shout as one before following their captain back to their own ships. They don&rsquo;t know what to make of what they saw in the water, how could they? They didn&rsquo;t see Emilia&rsquo;s body but instead a tail that changed from red to green. The Captain walks back to his ship more stressed than when he left it. How is he supposed to explain this to his King? He wasn&rsquo;t though, he wasn&rsquo;t going to tell the truth of this because the truth was nearly impossible. Two soldiers still linger by the bow, however, they look down at the cloak in the water. One then looks up at the other thinking like a madman before whispering to the other in complete bewilderness.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe that was-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; The other soldier automatically says knowing what his friend&rsquo;s thinking, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She was named a princess of the forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a name. Plus this is the sea, not the forest.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A forest can be under the sea though.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That rumor you think of isn&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then why kill her?&rdquo;</i></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Did I hear the Dothraki correct?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip; Apparently, they found a Goddess living in the caves.&rdquo;</p><p>Jorah Mormont answers truly confused as they follow their Queen down the narrow cave. Daenerys Targaryen, true Queen of Westeros, follows two Dothraki soldiers with torches down a cave they can&rsquo;t see the end of it. Behind her are her most trusted friends and allies, Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis. Behind the two men were three more Dothraki. The cave is right below when the Dothraki live, it&rsquo;s pitch black and rocky in every place imaginable. The Dothraki wanted to leave with the Dragon Queen but refuse to go unless their hidden Goddess came with them. They found her when they came here and haven&rsquo;t left this place since. The three of them have no idea what they were talking about, there was no such thing as a real Goddess. If so how could she be under here for so long? As they continue to follow the soldiers Jorah says more to himself out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;It explains why they&rsquo;ve made this here resting place for so long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They made it clear they wouldn&rsquo;t leave with me unless the Goddess came along.&rdquo; Their Queen, Daenerys Taryegan, points out as the Dothraki soldiers show her the way to the cave, &ldquo;They believe it&rsquo;s will bring bad luck to them all if we leave her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this so-called Goddess, anyway?&rdquo; Daario snaps with an awkward chuckle, &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be that powerful if she&rsquo;s trapped in a cave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They said She&rsquo;s the Goddess of&hellip;The Forest or Nature, I think.&rdquo; The Mother of Dragon thinks out loud before asking, &ldquo;Right, Jorah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty much. They said nature but that could mean a lot of things.&rdquo;</p><p>One of the Dothraki speaks up using his original tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;He says we&rsquo;re close.&rdquo;</p><p>When reaching the end of the rock narrow cave a huge dome appears. The Dothraki men stop walking at the edge, one hands the torch to Daenerys and the other hands it to Daario. The three look at one another worried since just that action alone lets them know the soldier will not be following them any longer. The three slowly walk out into the big dome, they look anywhere for any sign of life. The men go in front of Daenerys at they walk further into the cave but stop when hearing a chain move against the rock floor. They wave their torches to find where the sound came from. The chain sound fills the room once more before the sound of a growl or takes the sound. Suddenly fire fills the air letting the three see a dragon in the flames. They all back up in shock, it wasn&rsquo;t possible. Dragons only became existing a few months ago by Daenerys, how could one be under here.</p><p>The fire the dragon breathed out lights torches all around the cave that the Dothraki must have put up. The three cover their eyes from how bright the room has became only to see a glimpse of the Dragon shrinking into a human body. The cave is now completely light up, it&rsquo;s much bigger than they thought it was in full light. In the center of it was a woman with a chain around her neck. The chain was long but not long enough to reach where the three were standing. The woman has long dark brown hair with only a simple slave dress on. Daenerys walks past the men to get a closer look at her. She&rsquo;s never seen this woman before but she doesn&rsquo;t look from Essos. People in Essos usually have tan skin and deep dark from hair with familiar faces. Her face looks different, her skin was lighter than people born in Essos. Coming a little closer to the woman Daenerys ask loudly.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Goddess of Nature to the Dothraki.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She says with her voice slightly shaken, &ldquo;But what is your birth name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Princess of the Forest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re house name.&rdquo; Jorah then asks more precisely, &ldquo;What is your house name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Savage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Savage?&rdquo; Daario asks as if he heard it correctly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of such a name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I have.&rdquo; Daenery says in complete shock, &ldquo;My brother, Visery, told me a story when I was young. About the Kingdom of Savages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The woman begins laughing slowly while sitting in the center of the cave, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve heard that bedtime story.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys eyes are wide from thinking back to when she was only a child. Visery used to tell her a story in their studies about a Kingdom of Savages. It was a kingdom only made up of wild beasts ruled by a human and an animal. He said it was the kingdom of all forests the Savage house ruled over. Apparently, the Targaryen house adored them, loved them like their own family. The seven kingdoms didn&rsquo;t though, they feared them and wanted nothing to do with a King and Queen that could be human and a beast. Viserys told her the day all the dragons died the Savage house did too. It was always some made up legend when he told her the story. She vaguely remembers the story he told her but she&rsquo;ll never forget the name Savages. Coming closer to the woman Daenery asks cautiously,</p><p>&ldquo;Was it true? The Kingdom, the family, the deaths.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Every story told about my family is a little different.&rdquo; She mumbles without looking their way, &ldquo;The kingdom was real, the family was real, all the deaths were real&hellip; but one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yours.&rdquo;</p><p>The mother of Dragons breathes out in shock while coming even closer. She remembers Visery saying the family died along with all the dragons. He must not have known about this woman, about her surviving. Then again he never told her about how many were in the Savage family, he always talked about them as one thing. The two women, neither one born in Essos, were in Dothraki clothing standing inside a cave almost as big as a castle. The Savage woman sits with a chain around her neck that connected to the middle of the rocky cave. Kneeling down Daenerys looks at the chain and finds words embedded in a language she can not read. The chain must be rare enough not to be able to broke it with any weapon or fire, someone must have made this chain for people who were less than a god but more than a man. The last Targaryen stares at the woman in rare chains for a moment before asking.</p><p>&ldquo;Can these chains come off?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone can take it off beside the person wearing it.&rdquo; The woman answers while standing up and turning to her, &ldquo;Would you dare take it off me? You&rsquo;ve heard the stories.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare say yes.&rdquo; Daenerys smiles before waving her hands around and saying in surprise, &ldquo;If you help me take back the throne.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dany.&rdquo; Jorah speaks up in warning while taking a step closer, &ldquo;She was a dragon moments before. Take it off her and who knows what she&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; The woman growls with a smirk while she starts walking toward them, &ldquo;I can turn into any animal I want to at any time. Westeros feared my family because of it, Baratheon killed my family and exiled me because of it. The people who chained me up years ago feared me because of it. So tell me, why dare set me free when I am nothing but feared by many?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Targaryen, the last of my name.&rdquo; Daenerys announces while reaching the woman, &ldquo;In my family, we don&rsquo;t fear a gift, we embrace it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do we know she will stay true to her words?&rdquo; Daario then asks from where he&rsquo;s standing, &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a reason behind her being exiled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll stay true to her word, that&rsquo;s all a princess knows how to do.&rdquo; The Mother of Dragon says as if she&rsquo;s talking about herself before looking the woman in her eyes and saying in raw emotion, &ldquo;Fight for me, Savage, help me take back the throne. I will restore your family&rsquo;s name and honor them the way they should have. I will give you your freedom back when all this is said and done. We will restore-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What makes you think I care about my family&rsquo;s honor?&rdquo; The outlaw spits out in the chains holding her, &ldquo;My family&rsquo;s name is nothing more than a bedtime story for children because of the throne you want to sit on. I want nothing to do with the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to live the rest of my life in peace.&rdquo; The Savage declares only inches away from the so-called queen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running and fighting my whole life. I don&rsquo;t want to die that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After I am named Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, I will provide you safety to live the rest of your life in peace. I promise you that.&rdquo; Daenerys offers an emotional expression, &ldquo;But you have to stand by me and fight for me until I&rsquo;m named Queen of Westeros.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo; The woman states while throwing the chain beside Daenerys, &ldquo;Now takes this bloody chain off me.&rdquo;</p><p>The two men behind their Queen looks at the women in fear and move to attack position. Taking a deep breath Daenerys goes to the chain around the woman&rsquo;s neck and unlocks it. It falls to the ground and makes a loud shattering sound against the rocks. The Savage look down at it in shock of it actually coming off like that. She&rsquo;s spent years trying to take it off and trying to break it. Rubbing her neck she turns to Daenerys in disbelief that it came off that fast. The woman then pops her neck and shoulders from finally having that weight lifted off from her. Smiling wildly the Savage feels her blood pumping excitedly. She&rsquo;s ready to get out of the godforsaken cave and see the light again. Daenerys holds in a smile from seeing the woman&rsquo;s reaction before asking.</p><p>&ldquo;So tell me. What is your first name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Emilia.&rdquo; She announces with pride of who she is, &ldquo;Emilia Savage, last of my name, outlawed and exiled from Westeros, Princess of the forest, Goddess of Nature, and once ruler of the fallen Kingdom of Savages.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s journey until we reach Westeros&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When we reach Dragonstone we&rsquo;ll have one night of rest. Next morning we&rsquo;ll begin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Emilia all day&hellip;&rdquo; Tyrion Lannister, a man who always repays his debts, informs his traveling companions until he notices one missing and blurts out, &ldquo;Has anyone seen Lady Savage?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, please.&rdquo; Missandei speaks up with a playful smile before looking at the morning sky, &ldquo;How could you miss her?&rdquo;</p><p>With that said Tyrion rolls his eyes and looks up to see that Missandei is true to her words. Grey Worm, the Commander of the unsullied, grins before looking up to the ship&rsquo;s deck with his hands behind his back. Lord Varys sighs like he&rsquo;s the father of a bunch of children before too looking up to see where Emilia is. Only Daenerys Targaryen keeps looking straight ahead, she doesn&rsquo;t move a single muscle as she sees Dragonstone come into view. Seeing it forces her to smile and let out a shaky breath, she&rsquo;s so close yet so far away. After a moment the Mother of Dragons finally looks up to see her three babies and Emilia. Her three dragons soared in the air like they owned it, their wings were out for the world to see and they roar as loud as they like. The fourth dragon is in front of them all flying like it&rsquo;s on a mission. The scales we&rsquo;re forest green, they&rsquo;re so bright that it could blind a man when the sun touches them. Her wings soar in the air like no others have seen, she&rsquo;ll be at Dragonstone before anyone. Daenerys walks to the bow of the ship smiling before telling everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Emilia&rsquo;s ready to get off this bloody ship just as much as me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon you&rsquo;re grace.&rdquo; Lord Varys speaks up while saying lightly, &ldquo;But Lady Savage as barely been on this ship since we got on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo; She looks down at her shoes grinning away, &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dany, I must warn you.&rdquo; Tyrion goes to stand by his Queen, &ldquo;When people find out that you not only brought three dragons but woman from legends they will fear everything else you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; She lifts her head up high with her hands entwined in front of her, &ldquo;I accept that challenge, I&rsquo;ll show the world they should not fear something their ancestors told them to fear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; When my father told my family the story about the Savages he told it like they were the villains. Like they were the monsters of the world.&rdquo; Tyrion looks up to the Dragon turning into an eagle, &ldquo;Seeing her in the flesh&hellip; Makes me wonder how he could tell the story so wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I met her. She told me every story told about her family is a little different.&rdquo; Daenerys looks to her second hand and declares, &ldquo;I plan to tell the world the real story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful idea but can it be done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One look at her and they&rsquo;ll know everything they were told was a lie.&rdquo;</p></p>",
