Prank each other, prank others, and just all around run around. Those times were truly the days that you missed. </p><p>After the death of the twins parents, things had gone downhill from there. Pietro distanced himself, became cold and those days of fun had slowly come to a close. You weren&rsquo;t one to leave on bad terms though.  You had heard that the twins were around the area, joining the protests, you knew you would find them there. </p><p>Pushing through the loud crowd, you were right to believe that they would be there.  You easily spotted the tall man that you knew was Pietro. You had to be fast, they wouldnt sit still for long. Pushing through the angry civilians you stood behind the twins. </p><p>&ldquo;Piet.&rdquo; You say, he whipped around quickly. His eyes wide, </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)! What are you doing here?!&rdquo; He asked, his accent thick and filled with worry. </p><p>&ldquo;I was worried about you two&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t seen you guys in years!&rdquo; You say looking at him, &ldquo;I thought I lost my best friends.&quot;you whimper softly. The twins looked at each other before grabbing your arm and dragging you from the crowd. When the loud sound of yelling and chanting stopped was when you three stopped. Without thinking you engulfed Pietro in a tight hug, a few tears slipping from your eyes. He didnt hesitate to hug back.</p><p>&rdquo;(Y/N), why are you here?&ldquo;Wanda asked looking at the two of us, &quot;you could have gotten hurt!&rdquo; She stated, you pulled away from Pietro and looked at her, </p><p>&ldquo;Well clearly you two weren&rsquo;t coming to see me, I had to see you two. After you left, everything went downhill.&rdquo; You mumble softly, they were silent for a moment, </p><p>&ldquo;Mom got sick, dad left when times got tough. You two were all I had left.&rdquo; Tears continued to fall down your cheeks, they were silent. Almost as if they may be thinking. </p><p>We decided it was best to keep our distance.&ldquo;Wanda said as she looked at me, &quot;we are going to be joining a program, in hope&rsquo;s to avenge our parents.&rdquo; Your eyes widened in shock, no they couldn&rsquo;t, </p><p>&ldquo;No! You guys can&rsquo;t go! You&rsquo;re all I have left! I cant lose you both.&rdquo; Soft sobs escaped your throat as you tried to contain your emotions. Wanda sighed softly, </p><p>&ldquo;You have five minutes Pietro, then we have to go.&rdquo; Wanda said as she left the two of you. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)~&rdquo; he began but wasnt able to finish, </p><p>&ldquo;Is revenge really that important to you Piet? More important then your friends?&rdquo; You began, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going to say this.&rdquo; You mumble under your breath,  &ldquo;I love you, You idoit.&rdquo; You sob softly, he went quiet. He softly said your name before gently taking your hands, you look up locking eyes with his. Sadness shown in his eyes, </p><p>&ldquo;Please.&quot;you beg, &quot;Don&rsquo;t you dare leave me behind.&rdquo; He squeezed your hands gently before letting them go. His hand went up to caress your cheek gently before leaning down and connecting your lips.  You had loved this man ever since you had met, his cocky attitude and his gorgeous face. When he pulled away you held back a whine, </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I have to do this on my own.&rdquo; Those were the last words he said to you before leaving you alone. </p><p>After that day you heart had been shattered, broken in a million pieces. You didnt believe it could ever be repaired. The man of your dreams, the man you cared so deeply for left you. It had been months since you had seen them, maybe more then that&hellip; you had lost track of the time. </p><p>You sat in your small apartment, watching the news when there was a loud noise. Quickly standing you looked out the window, what was going on?</p><p>From that point on it became a war zone, everyone rushing to safety, you were one of those people. An army of robots wreaked havoc on the city you called home. Scrambling to get away, you ran as fast as you could before coming to a hard stop when a robot cut you off, </p><p>&ldquo;Stay calm, we are here to help.&rdquo; It states as it rose its robotic arm towards you. Taking a step back, you froze in horror. Was this truly how it was going to end? A blue blur caught your eye as the robot was destroyed.

He quickly sped off, you made sure to hang onto him until he stopped. </p><p>&ldquo;You will be safe here. Just stay down.&rdquo; You nodded and stayed were you were but you knew something was wrong. You had to get somewhere safe. </p><p>Quickly you fled your spot, rushing to the crowd of people who  seemed to be waiting for something. At the corner of your eye you saw a little boy, he was scared and clearly not going to move. Something inside of you clicked, you rushed towards the boy in hopes to save him but you were stopped. A hand grabbed your arm as you watched in horror, another man rushed towards the boy shielding him from the oncoming bullets. Though the unthinkable happened. There he stood, the love of your life. Blood staining his clothing, tears burned your eyes, </p><p>&ldquo;Pietro?&quot;you sob softly as he falls to the ground lifeless. You cried out as tears streamed down your face, you wanted to run over to him, hug him and beg him to wake up but you were dragged on the transport. You heart felt heavy, it hurt.

His hand went up to caress your cheek gently before leaning down and connecting your lips.  You had loved this man ever since you had met, his cocky attitude and his gorgeous face. When he pulled away you held back a whine, </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I have to do this on my own.&rdquo; Those were the last words he said to you before leaving you alone. </p><p>After that day you heart had been shattered, broken in a million pieces. You didnt believe it could ever be repaired. The man of your dreams, the man you cared so deeply for left you. It had been months since you had seen them, maybe more then that&hellip; you had lost track of the time. </p><p>You sat in your small apartment, watching the news when there was a loud noise. Quickly standing you looked out the window, what was going on?</p><p>From that point on it became a war zone, everyone rushing to safety, you were one of those people. An army of robots wreaked havoc on the city you called home. Scrambling to get away, you ran as fast as you could before coming to a hard stop when a robot cut you off, </p><p>&ldquo;Stay calm, we are here to help.&rdquo; It states as it rose its robotic arm towards you. Taking a step back, you froze in horror. Was this truly how it was going to end? A blue blur caught your eye as the robot was destroyed. A tall figure stood before you, silver hair, well built&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Pietro~&rdquo; you choke out, he turned around, his blue eyes wide. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)&rdquo; not caring about the fighting, you rushed over and hugged him tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;I need to get you to safety,\"he said, his accent thick as he picked you up bridal style. \"Hold on tight.&rdquo; He suggeste, you wrapped your arms around his neck and cuddled into his chest. He quickly sped off, you made sure to hang onto him until he stopped. </p><p>&ldquo;You will be safe here. Just stay down.&rdquo; You nodded and stayed were you were but you knew something was wrong. You had to get somewhere safe. </p><p>Quickly you fled your spot, rushing to the crowd of people who  seemed to be waiting for something. At the corner of your eye you saw a little boy, he was scared and clearly not going to move. Something inside of you clicked, you rushed towards the boy in hopes to save him but you were stopped. A hand grabbed your arm as you watched in horror, another man rushed towards the boy shielding him from the oncoming bullets. Though the unthinkable happened. There he stood, the love of your life. Blood staining his clothing, tears burned your eyes, </p><p>&ldquo;Pietro?\"you sob softly as he falls to the ground lifeless. You cried out as tears streamed down your face, you wanted to run over to him, hug him and beg him to wake up but you were dragged on the transport. You heart felt heavy, it hurt. You almost had him back but now it was all over.</p></p>",

But then he meets the reader and starts to fall in love with her while still looking for his soulmate. Little does he know that his soulmate is just in front of him, just transformed by a spell.\u00a0</p><p><i>Vocabulary :</i>\u00a0Y/N = your name Y/E/C = your eye color Y/N/H/C = your natural hair color\u00a0</p><p><b><a href=\"https://peonies-and-swords.tumblr.com/post/176914639495/masterlist\">Masterpost</a></b></p><h2><i><b>ENJOY!\u00a0</b></i></h2><p>Once again, he woke up panting. Once again his sleep was troubled by these visions. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t get one single night of sleep since he came back to Midgard after Ragnarok. Asgard was safe on this planet, protected by the Avengers on some land Tony Stark owned. He had been kindly offered a room at the new Avengers facility, and tried to help them as much as he could, wanting to prove the team he had changed since they last saw him.\u00a0</p><p>Yet these visions seemed to distract him from time to time, being like a riddle he couldn\u2019t understand.\u00a0</p><p>The first few nights it was only a voice, a woman\u2019s voice, soft almost whispering. She seemed to be responding to someone, or something. Whispering \u00ab\u00a0yes\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0no\u00a0\u00bb, or \u00ab\u00a0I didn\u2019t say that\u00a0\u00bb a few times. And night after night, details appeared. First he saw eyes, only eyes, beautiful Y/E/C eyes. And then a hair color, Y/N/H/C. With the whispering combined, he had dreamed every night of this riddle, and was getting really frustrated.</p><hr><p>After some time, not being able to figure this out by himself, he asked Thor who had no clue about what was going on with his brother. The only other Avengers on the base at that time were Vision and Wanda, the others being on a mission somewhere in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>When they were asked, Vision seemed to be as clueless as the Asgardians but Wanda remembered a story her grandmother told her as a child.</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0And what did she say ? asked Loki\u00a0</p><p>- Well, if I remember correctly , she said that we were created to be attached to somebody else, like a soulmate. That somewhere in the universe someone was made for you, to help you, love you and support you. And if the universe thinks that you\u2019re not finding them fast enough, it may help you by giving one of you clues, like a location or a voice or even a name.</p><p>- So \u2026 what you\u2019re saying \u2026 is that I might have a soulmate somewhere, and that the universe wants me to find them?\u00a0</p><p>- Yeah, I guess \u2026 If you believe in those things \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- You\u2019re a witch talking to a god of course I believe in *those things*\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Loki seemed relived with that answer, someone, somewhere, was waiting for him. He only had to find them.\u00a0</p><p><i>*Few days later*</i></p><p>The whole team was back from the mission, Loki didn\u2019t really mind the last days with only the four of them, being anxious that the old team would still hold grudges for New York and also knowing that the team grew up a lot and that he would have to learn new faces. He managed for few hours to avoid the team by hiding in the library , still searching for clues to find his soulmate. When dinner time came, he felt like he had to join the team, at least to try and be friendly.\u00a0</p><p>They were all gathered around the big table. Thor waved and almost shouted : \u00ab\u00a0Loki! Come here! I saved you a chair!\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>Loki moved towards him nodding at some new faces, trying to smile at Clint who looked like he had seen a ghost. He was beginning to feel like all this was a bad idea, he should have stayed with the Asgardians, he could feel the hostility in the air.\u00a0</p><p>Thor was seated next to Tony who just looked at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Hi\u2026</p><p>-\u00a0Oh hi Loki\u2026 Still trying to make us kneel ? Tony said before laughing a little.\u00a0</p><p>- Uh, no in fact \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Oh no, don\u2019t worry, Thor told us everything, Thanos, the torture, your father being king of a jerk with terrible parenting skills, Hela, Ragnarok\u2026 I won\u2019t say it was easy to forgive , see Clint isn\u2019t still sure that you have changed but \u2026 We\u2019ll see\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Thank you \u2026 and thank you for my people, but I assume Thor already told you how grateful we are.</p><p>- Yes, indeed. Now let\u2019s present to you the new members of the team\u2026 So this is Peter, aka Spiderman , Tony said pointing at a boy waving from the other side of the table, and I guess you remember Dr. Strange from your last visit on Earth. I believe you\u2019ve met both Wanda and Vision\u2026 You must remember Natasha and Captain America..\u00a0</p><p>- You can call me Steve \u2026 Happy to see you changed Loki \u2026 This is Bucky by the way, we grew up together.</p><p>- Very pleased to meet you Bucky\u00a0</p><p>- Yes, yes, we\u2019re not finished with the presentations just yet, this is Y/N, she is the latest addition to the team. Don\u2019t mess with her she\u2019s been training with Natasha\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- I\u2019ve seen the two fight, brother, she could rip my head off with one hand, whispered Thor smiling.\u00a0</p><p>- Well then\u2026 Hello Y/N\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>She lifted her head from the book she was reading . Loki looked in her eyes and felt like he had seen these eyes already \u2026 In his visions . He opened his mouth but then she said in a crackled voice:\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Hi Loki, I\u2019ve heard a great lot about you ! I hope when I\u2019m feeling better that we can train together! Natasha is getting tired of me and the others seem to be afraid of me!\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>The voice \u2026 It was not the same \u2026 Y/N\u2019s was raspy and almost breaking after every syllables\u2026 The one from the visions was way softer, like a lullaby. And the hair from the vision? Y/N/H/C . Not grey like Y/N\u2019s \u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Are you okay Loki? You froze for a second there, dear.\u00a0</p><p>- Ah! Yes, sorry \u2026 I thought \u2026 I thought I knew you from somewhere\u2026\u00a0\u00bb</p><p><i>*Few weeks later*</i></p><p>It had been almost a month since Loki learned about his soulmate. Yet he felt like he didn\u2019t learn anything at all. Every night the same vision. A voice, eyes and hair \u2026 That was all he got. And he wasn\u2019t even sure those clues meant something \u2026 Since Y/N appeared, he was feeling a little depressed. Why did her eyes match the ones from the vision but nothing else did ? And on top of that he felt like he was beginning to like her. They spent so much time together, being often in the same rooms . He spent most of his time in the library or reading in one of the many rooms of the base. And she liked reading, and drawing listening to music in a common room. They talked a lot even if few times she said that talking was painful for her, referring to some kind of accident that he had no knowledge of. She always seemed to make an effort to talk to him, with others she remained mainly quiet.\u00a0</p><p>But he could not fall for her. His soulmate was waiting for him! Yet he could not help it. She seemed to care about him, even when he was ranting about the most ridiculous things.\u00a0</p><p>After finding out about J\u00f6tunheim, his true form, losing his mother and having to destroy Asgard, he seemed to feel like he couldn\u2019t be loved or didn\u2019t even deserve it. But with the visions he hoped for someone like Y/N that would just listen to him, not pity him or be afraid.\u00a0</p><p>He joined her in one of the living room of the base. She was just sitting on the floor, art supplies scattered everywhere, drawing and bopping her head to a midgardian tune.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Ah Loki , she said seeing him walking towards her, I have such great news ! Tony said that he found a way to give me my voice back!\u00a0</p><p>- Your voice ?\u00a0</p><p>- Yes ! You didn\u2019t really think I always talked like that ? I told you I had an accident.</p><p>- Yes but I\u2026 I didn\u2019t know which kind\u2026</p><p>- Oh.. I must have forgotten to tell you, during our last mission with the team I was cornered by some kind of enhanced wizard and when I tried to hit him he just waved his hands and I felt this immense pain in my chest. Next thing I remember is in the plane back to the base, Tony saying to Clint that if my hair color mattered so much to me, he\u2019d buy me some box dye.\u00a0</p><p>- Your hair color ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>His heart started to pound in his chest. What ? Not her voice ? Not her hair ? What was going on? Was she after all the one ? He couldn\u2019t even ask her, so terrified that she wasn\u2019t his soulmate. He couldn\u2019t just risk to loose their friendship if this whole story frightened her.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0No shit sherlock, I don\u2019t have that much grey hair! And I\u2019m not rich enough to dye it every time I see it grow back! Well\u2026 Where was I ? Ah yes \u2026 When I woke up in the plane and tried to speak, I knew something wasn\u2019t right. Everything hurt so much. And my voice was different. Crackled. I was really scared but the whole team tried to act as if everything was okay. Tony promised that when we got back here he would try to find a cure. Stephen said that he would try to make up a counter-spell\u2026 And they tried\u2026 they really tried\u2026 But you know\u2026 It has been almost a month since we came back \u2026 I had almost lost hope \u2026 After all it\u2019s not that bad, a new hair color and a new voice ! Haha! It\u2019s like I\u2019ve changed identity ! It\u2019s just the pain that bothers me\u2026 But Tony said that he found something that could transform me back . We\u2019re trying it tonight. -</p><p>- Tha- That\u2019s great Y/N ! Loki chocked up a little. I look forward to see you in your true form!\u00a0</p><p>- Well calm down. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be turning blue or be from an entier other specie haha!\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Yeah that\u2019s <i>my\u00a0</i>speciality\u2026</p><p>- Oh, I\u2019m sorry Loki, I thought it was funny I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you !\u00a0</p><p>- Oh it was funny, my dear\u2026 said Loki grinning. So .. this cure ? How does it work ?\u00a0</p><p>- Tony said that it\u2019s like the Cap serum but\u2026 different ,she said laughing. I\u2019ll just have to spend the night in some kind of cocoon, they\u2019ll inject me a serum and in theory in a few hours \u2026 Boom normal Y/N will be back ! Not a big fan of the whole night in a cocoon thing but \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure Stark knows what he is doing\u2026 And if anything goes wrong I\u2019ll be there to kill Stark myself , Loki said trying not to laugh.</p><p>- Oh no that won\u2019t be necessary, love. But you\u2019re an Avenger now, your mission <i>is</i> to avenge me if something goes wrong!\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>They kept joking until Tony entered the room and accompanied Y/N to the lab.\u00a0</p><p>Loki stayed a bit in the room alone, but being too afraid to see her transformation and too anxious to just stay in place, he returned to his room.\u00a0</p><p>After a few hours of sleep, a few of worrying, he tried to wander around the building. Looking out the windows, stopping in front of every lab, looking for Y/N. At the end of a hallway he encountered Tony, who was smiling;\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Loki! Y/N was looking for you ! She said she wanted to surprise you\u2026</p><p>- Did everything went alright ? Is she \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Yes ! Everything went great ! Sh-\u00a0</p><p>- Where is she now ?\u00a0</p><p>- Ah \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 Try maybe \u2026 uh.. \u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Loki waved him goodbye and headed towards the library.\u00a0</p><p>And there she was. She was facing him. Her hair had changed color. Y/N/H/C. Like the vision. He just opened his mouth. His heart was pounding, a million question filled his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Hi\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>The voice.\u00a0</p><p><b>Her </b>voice.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Loki?\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>He just froze. Everything was clear now. He had wasted an entire month searching for someone that was right in front of him the whole time. His soulmate. Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>He moved towards her.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Is everything alright ?\u00a0</p><p>- Now that I found you\u2026 Everything will be\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>He closed the gap between them. Kissing her lips softly. She kissed him back, putting her hands on his waist as his were drawn to her face.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Not that I\u2019m complaining but\u2026 what is going on Loki ?\u00a0</p><p>- I just found you my love\u2026 I have so much to tell you \u2026 But first are you familiar with what you Midgardians call \u00ab\u00a0soulmates\u00a0\u00bb? \u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p>",

But then he meets the reader and starts to fall in love with her while still looking for his soulmate. Little does he know that his soulmate is just in front of him, just transformed by a spell.\u00a0</p><p><i>Vocabulary :</i>\u00a0Y/N = your name Y/E/C = your eye color Y/N/H/C = your natural hair color\u00a0</p><p><b><a href=\"https://peonies-and-swords.tumblr.com/post/176914639495/masterlist\">Masterpost</a></b></p><h2><i><b>ENJOY!\u00a0</b></i></h2><p>Once again, he woke up panting. Once again his sleep was troubled by these visions. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t get one single night of sleep since he came back to Midgard after Ragnarok. Asgard was safe on this planet, protected by the Avengers on some land Tony Stark owned. He had been kindly offered a room at the new Avengers facility, and tried to help them as much as he could, wanting to prove the team he had changed since they last saw him.\u00a0</p><p>Yet these visions seemed to distract him from time to time, being like a riddle he couldn\u2019t understand.\u00a0</p><p>The first few nights it was only a voice, a woman\u2019s voice, soft almost whispering. She seemed to be responding to someone, or something. Whispering \u00ab\u00a0yes\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0no\u00a0\u00bb, or \u00ab\u00a0I didn\u2019t say that\u00a0\u00bb a few times. And night after night, details appeared. First he saw eyes, only eyes, beautiful Y/E/C eyes. And then a hair color, Y/N/H/C. With the whispering combined, he had dreamed every night of this riddle, and was getting really frustrated.</p><hr><p>After some time, not being able to figure this out by himself, he asked Thor who had no clue about what was going on with his brother. The only other Avengers on the base at that time were Vision and Wanda, the others being on a mission somewhere in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>When they were asked, Vision seemed to be as clueless as the Asgardians but Wanda remembered a story her grandmother told her as a child.</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0And what did she say ? asked Loki\u00a0</p><p>- Well, if I remember correctly , she said that we were created to be attached to somebody else, like a soulmate. That somewhere in the universe someone was made for you, to help you, love you and support you. And if the universe thinks that you\u2019re not finding them fast enough, it may help you by giving one of you clues, like a location or a voice or even a name.</p><p>- So \u2026 what you\u2019re saying \u2026 is that I might have a soulmate somewhere, and that the universe wants me to find them?\u00a0</p><p>- Yeah, I guess \u2026 If you believe in those things \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- You\u2019re a witch talking to a god of course I believe in *those things*\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Loki seemed relived with that answer, someone, somewhere, was waiting for him. He only had to find them.\u00a0</p><p><i>*Few days later*</i></p><p>The whole team was back from the mission, Loki didn\u2019t really mind the last days with only the four of them, being anxious that the old team would still hold grudges for New York and also knowing that the team grew up a lot and that he would have to learn new faces. He managed for few hours to avoid the team by hiding in the library , still searching for clues to find his soulmate. When dinner time came, he felt like he had to join the team, at least to try and be friendly.\u00a0</p><p>They were all gathered around the big table. Thor waved and almost shouted : \u00ab\u00a0Loki! Come here! I saved you a chair!\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>Loki moved towards him nodding at some new faces, trying to smile at Clint who looked like he had seen a ghost. He was beginning to feel like all this was a bad idea, he should have stayed with the Asgardians, he could feel the hostility in the air.\u00a0</p><p>Thor was seated next to Tony who just looked at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Hi\u2026</p><p>-\u00a0Oh hi Loki\u2026 Still trying to make us kneel ? Tony said before laughing a little.\u00a0</p><p>- Uh, no in fact \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Oh no, don\u2019t worry, Thor told us everything, Thanos, the torture, your father being king of a jerk with terrible parenting skills, Hela, Ragnarok\u2026 I won\u2019t say it was easy to forgive , see Clint isn\u2019t still sure that you have changed but \u2026 We\u2019ll see\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Thank you \u2026 and thank you for my people, but I assume Thor already told you how grateful we are.</p><p>- Yes, indeed. Now let\u2019s present to you the new members of the team\u2026 So this is Peter, aka Spiderman , Tony said pointing at a boy waving from the other side of the table, and I guess you remember Dr. Strange from your last visit on Earth. I believe you\u2019ve met both Wanda and Vision\u2026 You must remember Natasha and Captain America..\u00a0</p><p>- You can call me Steve \u2026 Happy to see you changed Loki \u2026 This is Bucky by the way, we grew up together.</p><p>- Very pleased to meet you Bucky\u00a0</p><p>- Yes, yes, we\u2019re not finished with the presentations just yet, this is Y/N, she is the latest addition to the team. Don\u2019t mess with her she\u2019s been training with Natasha\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- I\u2019ve seen the two fight, brother, she could rip my head off with one hand, whispered Thor smiling.\u00a0</p><p>- Well then\u2026 Hello Y/N\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>She lifted her head from the book she was reading .

But then he meets the reader and starts to fall in love with her while still looking for his soulmate. Little does he know that his soulmate is just in front of him, just transformed by a spell.\u00a0</p><p><i>Vocabulary :</i>\u00a0Y/N = your name Y/E/C = your eye color Y/N/H/C = your natural hair color\u00a0</p><p><b><a href=\"https://peonies-and-swords.tumblr.com/post/176914639495/masterlist\">Masterpost</a></b></p><h2><i><b>ENJOY!\u00a0</b></i></h2><p>Once again, he woke up panting. Once again his sleep was troubled by these visions. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t get one single night of sleep since he came back to Midgard after Ragnarok. Asgard was safe on this planet, protected by the Avengers on some land Tony Stark owned. He had been kindly offered a room at the new Avengers facility, and tried to help them as much as he could, wanting to prove the team he had changed since they last saw him.\u00a0</p><p>Yet these visions seemed to distract him from time to time, being like a riddle he couldn\u2019t understand.\u00a0</p><p>The first few nights it was only a voice, a woman\u2019s voice, soft almost whispering. She seemed to be responding to someone, or something. Whispering \u00ab\u00a0yes\u00a0\u00bb, \u00ab\u00a0no\u00a0\u00bb, or \u00ab\u00a0I didn\u2019t say that\u00a0\u00bb a few times. And night after night, details appeared. First he saw eyes, only eyes, beautiful Y/E/C eyes. And then a hair color, Y/N/H/C. With the whispering combined, he had dreamed every night of this riddle, and was getting really frustrated.</p><hr><p>After some time, not being able to figure this out by himself, he asked Thor who had no clue about what was going on with his brother. The only other Avengers on the base at that time were Vision and Wanda, the others being on a mission somewhere in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>When they were asked, Vision seemed to be as clueless as the Asgardians but Wanda remembered a story her grandmother told her as a child.</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0And what did she say ? asked Loki\u00a0</p><p>- Well, if I remember correctly , she said that we were created to be attached to somebody else, like a soulmate. That somewhere in the universe someone was made for you, to help you, love you and support you. And if the universe thinks that you\u2019re not finding them fast enough, it may help you by giving one of you clues, like a location or a voice or even a name.</p><p>- So \u2026 what you\u2019re saying \u2026 is that I might have a soulmate somewhere, and that the universe wants me to find them?\u00a0</p><p>- Yeah, I guess \u2026 If you believe in those things \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- You\u2019re a witch talking to a god of course I believe in *those things*\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Loki seemed relived with that answer, someone, somewhere, was waiting for him. He only had to find them.\u00a0</p><p><i>*Few days later*</i></p><p>The whole team was back from the mission, Loki didn\u2019t really mind the last days with only the four of them, being anxious that the old team would still hold grudges for New York and also knowing that the team grew up a lot and that he would have to learn new faces. He managed for few hours to avoid the team by hiding in the library , still searching for clues to find his soulmate. When dinner time came, he felt like he had to join the team, at least to try and be friendly.\u00a0</p><p>They were all gathered around the big table. Thor waved and almost shouted : \u00ab\u00a0Loki! Come here! I saved you a chair!\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>Loki moved towards him nodding at some new faces, trying to smile at Clint who looked like he had seen a ghost. He was beginning to feel like all this was a bad idea, he should have stayed with the Asgardians, he could feel the hostility in the air.\u00a0</p><p>Thor was seated next to Tony who just looked at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Hi\u2026</p><p>-\u00a0Oh hi Loki\u2026 Still trying to make us kneel ? Tony said before laughing a little.\u00a0</p><p>- Uh, no in fact \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Oh no, don\u2019t worry, Thor told us everything, Thanos, the torture, your father being king of a jerk with terrible parenting skills, Hela, Ragnarok\u2026 I won\u2019t say it was easy to forgive , see Clint isn\u2019t still sure that you have changed but \u2026 We\u2019ll see\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Thank you \u2026 and thank you for my people, but I assume Thor already told you how grateful we are.</p><p>- Yes, indeed. Now let\u2019s present to you the new members of the team\u2026 So this is Peter, aka Spiderman , Tony said pointing at a boy waving from the other side of the table, and I guess you remember Dr. Strange from your last visit on Earth. I believe you\u2019ve met both Wanda and Vision\u2026 You must remember Natasha and Captain America..\u00a0</p><p>- You can call me Steve \u2026 Happy to see you changed Loki \u2026 This is Bucky by the way, we grew up together.</p><p>- Very pleased to meet you Bucky\u00a0</p><p>- Yes, yes, we\u2019re not finished with the presentations just yet, this is Y/N, she is the latest addition to the team. Don\u2019t mess with her she\u2019s been training with Natasha\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- I\u2019ve seen the two fight, brother, she could rip my head off with one hand, whispered Thor smiling.\u00a0</p><p>- Well then\u2026 Hello Y/N\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>She lifted her head from the book she was reading . Loki looked in her eyes and felt like he had seen these eyes already \u2026 In his visions . He opened his mouth but then she said in a crackled voice:\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Hi Loki, I\u2019ve heard a great lot about you ! I hope when I\u2019m feeling better that we can train together! Natasha is getting tired of me and the others seem to be afraid of me!\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>The voice \u2026 It was not the same \u2026 Y/N\u2019s was raspy and almost breaking after every syllables\u2026 The one from the visions was way softer, like a lullaby. And the hair from the vision? Y/N/H/C . Not grey like Y/N\u2019s \u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Are you okay Loki? You froze for a second there, dear.\u00a0</p><p>- Ah! Yes, sorry \u2026 I thought \u2026 I thought I knew you from somewhere\u2026\u00a0\u00bb</p><p><i>*Few weeks later*</i></p><p>It had been almost a month since Loki learned about his soulmate. Yet he felt like he didn\u2019t learn anything at all. Every night the same vision. A voice, eyes and hair \u2026 That was all he got. And he wasn\u2019t even sure those clues meant something \u2026 Since Y/N appeared, he was feeling a little depressed. Why did her eyes match the ones from the vision but nothing else did ? And on top of that he felt like he was beginning to like her. They spent so much time together, being often in the same rooms . He spent most of his time in the library or reading in one of the many rooms of the base. And she liked reading, and drawing listening to music in a common room. They talked a lot even if few times she said that talking was painful for her, referring to some kind of accident that he had no knowledge of. She always seemed to make an effort to talk to him, with others she remained mainly quiet.\u00a0</p><p>But he could not fall for her. His soulmate was waiting for him! Yet he could not help it. She seemed to care about him, even when he was ranting about the most ridiculous things.\u00a0</p><p>After finding out about J\u00f6tunheim, his true form, losing his mother and having to destroy Asgard, he seemed to feel like he couldn\u2019t be loved or didn\u2019t even deserve it. But with the visions he hoped for someone like Y/N that would just listen to him, not pity him or be afraid.\u00a0</p><p>He joined her in one of the living room of the base. She was just sitting on the floor, art supplies scattered everywhere, drawing and bopping her head to a midgardian tune.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Ah Loki , she said seeing him walking towards her, I have such great news ! Tony said that he found a way to give me my voice back!\u00a0</p><p>- Your voice ?\u00a0</p><p>- Yes ! You didn\u2019t really think I always talked like that ? I told you I had an accident.</p><p>- Yes but I\u2026 I didn\u2019t know which kind\u2026</p><p>- Oh.. I must have forgotten to tell you, during our last mission with the team I was cornered by some kind of enhanced wizard and when I tried to hit him he just waved his hands and I felt this immense pain in my chest. Next thing I remember is in the plane back to the base, Tony saying to Clint that if my hair color mattered so much to me, he\u2019d buy me some box dye.\u00a0</p><p>- Your hair color ?\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>His heart started to pound in his chest. What ? Not her voice ? Not her hair ? What was going on? Was she after all the one ? He couldn\u2019t even ask her, so terrified that she wasn\u2019t his soulmate. He couldn\u2019t just risk to loose their friendship if this whole story frightened her.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0No shit sherlock, I don\u2019t have that much grey hair! And I\u2019m not rich enough to dye it every time I see it grow back! Well\u2026 Where was I ? Ah yes \u2026 When I woke up in the plane and tried to speak, I knew something wasn\u2019t right. Everything hurt so much. And my voice was different. Crackled. I was really scared but the whole team tried to act as if everything was okay. Tony promised that when we got back here he would try to find a cure. Stephen said that he would try to make up a counter-spell\u2026 And they tried\u2026 they really tried\u2026 But you know\u2026 It has been almost a month since we came back \u2026 I had almost lost hope \u2026 After all it\u2019s not that bad, a new hair color and a new voice ! Haha! It\u2019s like I\u2019ve changed identity ! It\u2019s just the pain that bothers me\u2026 But Tony said that he found something that could transform me back . We\u2019re trying it tonight. -</p><p>- Tha- That\u2019s great Y/N ! Loki chocked up a little. I look forward to see you in your true form!\u00a0</p><p>- Well calm down. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be turning blue or be from an entier other specie haha!\u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Yeah that\u2019s <i>my\u00a0</i>speciality\u2026</p><p>- Oh, I\u2019m sorry Loki, I thought it was funny I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you !\u00a0</p><p>- Oh it was funny, my dear\u2026 said Loki grinning. So .. this cure ? How does it work ?\u00a0</p><p>- Tony said that it\u2019s like the Cap serum but\u2026 different ,she said laughing. I\u2019ll just have to spend the night in some kind of cocoon, they\u2019ll inject me a serum and in theory in a few hours \u2026 Boom normal Y/N will be back ! Not a big fan of the whole night in a cocoon thing but \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure Stark knows what he is doing\u2026 And if anything goes wrong I\u2019ll be there to kill Stark myself , Loki said trying not to laugh.</p><p>- Oh no that won\u2019t be necessary, love. But you\u2019re an Avenger now, your mission <i>is</i> to avenge me if something goes wrong!\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>They kept joking until Tony entered the room and accompanied Y/N to the lab.\u00a0</p><p>Loki stayed a bit in the room alone, but being too afraid to see her transformation and too anxious to just stay in place, he returned to his room.\u00a0</p><p>After a few hours of sleep, a few of worrying, he tried to wander around the building. Looking out the windows, stopping in front of every lab, looking for Y/N. At the end of a hallway he encountered Tony, who was smiling;\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Loki! Y/N was looking for you ! She said she wanted to surprise you\u2026</p><p>- Did everything went alright ? Is she \u2026\u00a0</p><p>- Yes ! Everything went great ! Sh-\u00a0</p><p>- Where is she now ?\u00a0</p><p>- Ah \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 Try maybe \u2026 uh.. \u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>Loki waved him goodbye and headed towards the library.\u00a0</p><p>And there she was. She was facing him. Her hair had changed color. Y/N/H/C. Like the vision. He just opened his mouth. His heart was pounding, a million question filled his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Hi\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>The voice.\u00a0</p><p><b>Her </b>voice.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Loki?\u00a0\u00bb</p><p>He just froze. Everything was clear now. He had wasted an entire month searching for someone that was right in front of him the whole time. His soulmate. Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>He moved towards her.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Is everything alright ?\u00a0</p><p>- Now that I found you\u2026 Everything will be\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p><p>He closed the gap between them. Kissing her lips softly. She kissed him back, putting her hands on his waist as his were drawn to her face.\u00a0</p><p>\u00ab\u00a0Not that I\u2019m complaining but\u2026 what is going on Loki ?\u00a0</p><p>- I just found you my love\u2026 I have so much to tell you \u2026 But first are you familiar with what you Midgardians call \u00ab\u00a0soulmates\u00a0\u00bb? \u00a0\u00bb\u00a0</p></p>",

I&rsquo;ll just have to spend the night in some kind of cocoon, they&rsquo;ll inject me a serum and in theory in a few hours &hellip; Boom normal Y/N will be back ! Not a big fan of the whole night in a cocoon thing but &hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>- Don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m sure Stark knows what he is doing&hellip; And if anything goes wrong I&rsquo;ll be there to kill Stark myself , Loki said trying not to laugh.</p><p>- Oh no that won&rsquo;t be necessary, love. But you&rsquo;re an Avenger now, your mission <i>is</i> to avenge me if something goes wrong!&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>They kept joking until Tony entered the room and accompanied Y/N to the lab.&nbsp;</p><p>Loki stayed a bit in the room alone, but being too afraid to see her transformation and too anxious to just stay in place, he returned to his room.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few hours of sleep, a few of worrying, he tried to wander around the building. Looking out the windows, stopping in front of every lab, looking for Y/N. At the end of a hallway he encountered Tony, who was smiling;&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Loki! Y/N was looking for you ! She said she wanted to surprise you&hellip;</p><p>- Did everything went alright ? Is she &hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>- Yes ! Everything went great ! Sh-&nbsp;</p><p>- Where is she now ?&nbsp;</p><p>- Ah &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know &hellip; Try maybe &hellip; uh.. &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Loki waved him goodbye and headed towards the library.&nbsp;</p><p>And there she was. She was facing him. Her hair had changed color. Y/N/H/C. Like the vision. He just opened his mouth. His heart was pounding, a million question filled his head.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Hi&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The voice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Her </b>voice.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Loki?&nbsp;&raquo;</p><p>He just froze. Everything was clear now. He had wasted an entire month searching for someone that was right in front of him the whole time. His soulmate. Y/N.&nbsp;</p><p>He moved towards her.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Is everything alright ?&nbsp;</p><p>- Now that I found you&hellip; Everything will be&nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He closed the gap between them. Kissing her lips softly. She kissed him back, putting her hands on his waist as his were drawn to her face.&nbsp;</p><p>&laquo;&nbsp;Not that I&rsquo;m complaining but&hellip; what is going on Loki ?&nbsp;</p><p>- I just found you my love&hellip; I have so much to tell you &hellip; But first are you familiar with what you Midgardians call &laquo;&nbsp;soulmates&nbsp;&raquo;? &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;</p></p>",
