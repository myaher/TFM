Tragedy strikes not too long after.</p><p><b>On the Ranch</b></p><p>\u201cPlease behave today.\u201d Iris patted Pixie, her shiny Mudsdale, on the neck as she led her into the round pen. She began to lunge her in a circle, making smooching noises to get her to trot.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon. You can do better than that!\u201d Pixie glanced at her and decided now was the perfect time to get mad.</p><p>She reared up and sped into a canter, bucking continuously as she circled around the pen. Iris struggled to stand her ground, skidding across the ground and just barely holding on to the lead rope.\u00a0\u201cI need some help over here!\u201d Damn, this was her biggest tantrum yet. She was yelling\u00a0\u201cWoah!\u201d to get the Pokemon to slow down, but she ignored her pleas. Pixie slowed down for second, distracted by something, allowing Iris to grab her Pokeball from her belt and throw it.\u00a0</p><p>The Pokeball captured Pixie, dropping the halter on the ground in her place. She walked over and stuffed the ball into her belt, wincing at her tired arms. A whistle sounded from behind her causing her to turn around.\u00a0\u201cNice job, when did\u2019ya get that one? Shiny, right?\u201d Guzma was leaning against a tree, smirking. She rolled her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbout three years ago, and she is indeed a shiny. When did you get here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, about 10 minutes ago. Figured I\u2019d grace you with my presence.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, Guz. I have more to do and you\u2019re helping me. You still know how to clean tack right?\u201d He rolled his eyes, causing her to giggle. He trudged after her towards the barn.</p><hr><p>It had taken hours to get done with tack and they were drenched with sweat by then. It was on their way out of the barn that Iris saw Guzma. She really saw him. His shirt was clinging to his sides, with his jacket clutched in his hand. He had gained a lot of muscle. He was well defined. Noticing that she was staring, she wrenched eyes away. No. Don\u2019t look at him like that. You only just found him again. He\u2019s just a friend and nothing more.\u00a0\u201cYou alright?\u201d She had stopped in her tracks and was staring at the ground.</p><p>Iris looked up to meet his eyes.\u00a0\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just got distracted. Want to grab a bite to eat?\u201d Concern flashed in his eyes before he suddenly became unreadable. They walked out before Iris yelled for her mother.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to get dinner. Call me if something happens!\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response before leaving.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWanna go for a swim first?\u201d Raising an eyebrow, she turned and put her hands on her hips.\u00a0\u201cHey, chill. I\u2019m not doing anything. It\u2019s just hot outside.\u201d Guzma raised his hands at her. She giggled as they made their way through Poni Plains, running through until they got to the Seafolk Village. Iris threw off her shirt and dropped her bag, leaving her in her sports bra and jeans.\u00a0</p><p>She plunged in and tread water until Guzma dove in. Iris normally would never do this but something about him made her feel safe and confident. She splashed him, which elicited an exaggerated gasp an a large splash in Iris\u2019 face. She splashed him as she dove under and made her way for the beach. Reaching it quickly, she focused on Guzma slowly swimming towards her. A whisper from behind her caught her attention.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d</p><p>Iris whipped her head around and saw the man who was whispering to a woman.\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know that Team Skull is dangerous. He\u2019s the worst one.\u201d He did not just say that! She marched up to them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBattle me! Sylveon!\u201d She threw out her Sylveon, who let out a high pitched chirp.\u00a0\u201cMoonblast!\u201d The move took out the Huntail that the trainer had just sent out immediately. She withdrew Sylveon just before a hand clamped onto her shoulder and pulled her away from the beach.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?!\u201d Iris shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey were badmouthing you and I couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already ruinin you\u2019re reputation by hangin out with me! Do you realize this impacts you?\u201d She shook her head in annoyance and walked to grab her shirt and purse off of the docks, throwing them on and walking back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breathe, Guz. I don\u2019t care if they hate me. They\u2019ll learn to stop saying stuff like that.\u201d He clenched his fists at his sides and walked with her.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get food, big guy.\u201d She grabbed him by the hand and started to lead him to the docks when she realized how calloused and rough his hands were. They would feel nice around her thr- Shit, no. Don\u2019t think like that. No matter how hot he is, he has to be just a friend. She pulled him to The Boat, her favorite restaurant, and let go of his hand, nudging him inside.</p><p>\u201cHey! What would you like to-\u201d The boy at the counter stopped speaking as he noticed who was in front of him. A worried expression crossed his face as Guzma walked towards the counter. Iris hurried up beside him quickly,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s with me. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d His expression lightened slightly,\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, Iris! Nice to see you! I take it you want the usual?\u201d She grinned and nodded,\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take whatever she\u2019s getting.\u201d They walked upstairs to the\u00a0\u2018VIP\u2019 seating. It was nothing fancy, but she got to sit there due to the fact that she often delivered groceries with Pixie to the restaurant.\u00a0\u201cSo uh, I guess you stay at Po Town with the rest of Team Skull?\u201d Iris raised her eyebrows at Guzma.\u00a0\u201cYeah I do. They\u2019re family to me.\u201d He was slouching even more as the food was brought over, as if he was trying to hide his face. Iris dug into the large bowl, as if she was starving. Guzma had already eaten his by the time she was done.</p><p>\u201cDamn you eat faster than me.\u201d She copied his accent. It was hard to put into words. He let out a chuckle, and grinned at her.\u00a0</p><p>She stood up and walked to the counter with Guzma. He went to take cash out of his pocket when she stopped him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d He sighed in protest and let his arms hang by his sides. Iris took the two heart scales and shoved them into her bag. They had just stepped out of the restaurant when her phone started to ring. She accepted the call and lifted it to her ear.   \u201cVee is sick. You need to get home now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStay with him until I get there. Bye, Mom.\u201d Grabbing Guzma\u2019s hand, she pulled him along the dock.\u00a0\u201cSomething is up with our newborn Mudbray and we need to get back to the ranch.\u201d She threw out Pixie\u2019s Pokeball and hopped onto her once she appeared. Iris reached her hand out for Guzma and pulled him on.\u00a0\u201cHold on tight!\u201d She kicked Pixie in the sides, making her bolt. Guzma instinctively grabbed her waist for a moment, making Iris blush. No time to react. Focus on Pixie.</p><p>She smooched repetitively at Pixie to get her to go faster. The ride was rough and bouncy, making it increasingly more awkward for the two. </p><p>When they finally arrived, she recalled Pixie and ran to the barn with Guzma.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d Vee was laying in the middle of the barn, struggling to breathe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBotulism. He probably won\u2019t make it.\u201d Her mom was standing over Vee. Iris dropped to her knees and leaned over Vee with her hair hiding her face. He was struggling to breath and would flail his legs around. The sight of a sick Mudbray is one that you don\u2019t want to see. It was pitiful. The once playful Pokemon was struggling to even live.</p><p>Iris let out an ugly sob. It all came out at once as she looked at the state he was in. His eyes were growing dull. She put her head on his side and intertwined her fingers in his fur.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, buddy. You sweet little thing.\u201d An arm wrapped around her shoulder and pulled her closer.</p><p>\u201cIt probably won\u2019t work but I have a full restore we can try if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d She looked up at Guzma and put her hand out. He placed the full restore in her hand. She sprayed it on Vee. He relaxed but that was it. Petting him, she looked at Guzma.\u00a0\u201cI think it at least took the pain away.\u201d Guzma pulled her close again and pet Vee.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to stay out here with him. Might get Nurse Joy out here to see if there\u2019s anything we can do.\u201d Her mother crouched down and pet Vee.\u00a0\u201cCoconut! Come here!\u201d Her mom called for her beloved Mudsdale and mother of Vee. The beautiful and fit Mare trotted in and nickered for Vee, making him flail and attempt to get up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go inside. Bye little guy. I love you.\u201d She placed a kiss on the Mudbray\u2019s head and walked out of the barn with Guzma following behind. Iris had stopped crying as they walked across the grass. She stepped to the door and threw it open.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower. You can after me if you want. We can probably find some old clothes of my brothers\u2019 for you to wear if you wanna wash yours.\u201d She walked through the ranch style house towards the bathroom and stepped inside.</p><p>After she had gotten dressed in her gray and green Magikarp t-shirt with her new pair of blue jean shorts. She had reached the living room to find Guzma nursing a glass of water.\u00a0\u201cMade yourself at home?\u201d He laughed and stretched his legs out onto the coffee table.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t mind. You want to find some clothes for you? Your clothes must be gross by now.\u201d It was true, they were soaked in sweat and sea water. They kinda looked like they hadn\u2019t been washed well for a while. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get me clothes. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She walked towards her brothers\u2019 room.\u00a0\u201cDude, I\u2019ll feel guilty if I don\u2019t.\u201d Her voice deepened a bit as she worried about him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He dragged the word out as he walked towards her and followed her into the room. She dug around in the closet before pulling out a black T-shirt and grey sweatpants. Iris tossed them at him and pushed him to the shower.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey! Watch it!\u201d He said, quickly flipping her off and hurrying in. </p><p>\u201cUse whatever products you want!\u201d She called. She walked to the couch and flopped down, sighing. It was hard knowing that Vee was dying. It would happen occasionally with Pokemon, and botulism almost always proved fatal.<br/></p><p>She sat for a good 15 minutes before Guzma walked out with his clothes in his arms and wearing the ones she picked out. They were a bit too small, but not extreme.\u00a0\u201cYou live in Po Town, right?\u201d He nodded and sat down on the recliner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ll go ahead and wash your clothes for you.\u201d Iris stood up and took them out of his arms. It slightly surprised her that he didn\u2019t resist at all. Weird. She walked to the laundry room and turned on the machine once she put everything in. Walking back to the couch, she sat down. \u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes. You don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut I do need to worry about it, Guzma.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou have much bigger things to worry about. Now drop it.\u201d He looked serious and refused to make eye contact.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo what? That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to help.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna leave it, are you?\u201d She shook her head and sat straighter.\u00a0\u201cYou gotta promise not to tell anyone. Madam Prez doesn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know how things can be. The gang hasn\u2019t been bringin\u2019 in so much money lately. We needed another source of income so everyone can eat. The President of Aether is offerin\u2019 to pay us to keep people away from certain areas. I\u2019m still tryin\u2019 to figure out what to do.\u201d Guzma scratched his black undercut and looked at the ground.<br/></p><p>Iris had heard of Aether before. They were some conservation center who pledged to save Pokemon.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d say do it. Be careful though. Offers like that can be pretty risky.\u201d He nodded and stood up.</p><p>\u201cI better get goin. You can send my clothes to Po Town. Thanks for lettin\u2019 me wash em.\u201d She smiled at him and stood up.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to do that. Have a nice day, Guz.\u201d He walked to the door and left. Iris watched him go, feeling a slight pang of sadness. It was honestly really nice being around him. He wasn\u2019t as bad as people really made him out to be.<br/></p><hr><hr><p>That took way too long for me to write. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to write Guzma but I think I\u2019m doing fine. Hope you enjoyed!</p>",

Sylveon!\u201d She threw out her Sylveon, who let out a high pitched chirp.\u00a0\u201cMoonblast!\u201d The move took out the Huntail that the trainer had just sent out immediately. She withdrew Sylveon just before a hand clamped onto her shoulder and pulled her away from the beach.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?!\u201d Iris shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey were badmouthing you and I couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already ruinin you\u2019re reputation by hangin out with me! Do you realize this impacts you?\u201d She shook her head in annoyance and walked to grab her shirt and purse off of the docks, throwing them on and walking back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breathe, Guz. I don\u2019t care if they hate me. They\u2019ll learn to stop saying stuff like that.\u201d He clenched his fists at his sides and walked with her.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get food, big guy.\u201d She grabbed him by the hand and started to lead him to the docks when she realized how calloused and rough his hands were. They would feel nice around her thr- Shit, no. Don\u2019t think like that. No matter how hot he is, he has to be just a friend. She pulled him to The Boat, her favorite restaurant, and let go of his hand, nudging him inside.</p><p>\u201cHey! What would you like to-\u201d The boy at the counter stopped speaking as he noticed who was in front of him. A worried expression crossed his face as Guzma walked towards the counter. Iris hurried up beside him quickly,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s with me. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d His expression lightened slightly,\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, Iris! Nice to see you! I take it you want the usual?\u201d She grinned and nodded,\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take whatever she\u2019s getting.\u201d They walked upstairs to the\u00a0\u2018VIP\u2019 seating. It was nothing fancy, but she got to sit there due to the fact that she often delivered groceries with Pixie to the restaurant.\u00a0\u201cSo uh, I guess you stay at Po Town with the rest of Team Skull?\u201d Iris raised her eyebrows at Guzma.\u00a0\u201cYeah I do. They\u2019re family to me.\u201d He was slouching even more as the food was brought over, as if he was trying to hide his face. Iris dug into the large bowl, as if she was starving. Guzma had already eaten his by the time she was done.</p><p>\u201cDamn you eat faster than me.\u201d She copied his accent. It was hard to put into words. He let out a chuckle, and grinned at her.\u00a0</p><p>She stood up and walked to the counter with Guzma. He went to take cash out of his pocket when she stopped him.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d He sighed in protest and let his arms hang by his sides. Iris took the two heart scales and shoved them into her bag. They had just stepped out of the restaurant when her phone started to ring. She accepted the call and lifted it to her ear.   \u201cVee is sick. You need to get home now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStay with him until I get there. Bye, Mom.\u201d Grabbing Guzma\u2019s hand, she pulled him along the dock.\u00a0\u201cSomething is up with our newborn Mudbray and we need to get back to the ranch.\u201d She threw out Pixie\u2019s Pokeball and hopped onto her once she appeared. Iris reached her hand out for Guzma and pulled him on.\u00a0\u201cHold on tight!\u201d She kicked Pixie in the sides, making her bolt. Guzma instinctively grabbed her waist for a moment, making Iris blush. No time to react. Focus on Pixie.</p><p>She smooched repetitively at Pixie to get her to go faster. The ride was rough and bouncy, making it increasingly more awkward for the two. </p><p>When they finally arrived, she recalled Pixie and ran to the barn with Guzma.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d Vee was laying in the middle of the barn, struggling to breathe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBotulism. He probably won\u2019t make it.\u201d Her mom was standing over Vee. Iris dropped to her knees and leaned over Vee with her hair hiding her face. He was struggling to breath and would flail his legs around. The sight of a sick Mudbray is one that you don\u2019t want to see. It was pitiful. The once playful Pokemon was struggling to even live.</p><p>Iris let out an ugly sob. It all came out at once as she looked at the state he was in. His eyes were growing dull. She put her head on his side and intertwined her fingers in his fur.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, buddy. You sweet little thing.\u201d An arm wrapped around her shoulder and pulled her closer.</p><p>\u201cIt probably won\u2019t work but I have a full restore we can try if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d She looked up at Guzma and put her hand out. He placed the full restore in her hand. She sprayed it on Vee. He relaxed but that was it. Petting him, she looked at Guzma.\u00a0\u201cI think it at least took the pain away.\u201d Guzma pulled her close again and pet Vee.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to stay out here with him. Might get Nurse Joy out here to see if there\u2019s anything we can do.\u201d Her mother crouched down and pet Vee.\u00a0\u201cCoconut! Come here!\u201d Her mom called for her beloved Mudsdale and mother of Vee. The beautiful and fit Mare trotted in and nickered for Vee, making him flail and attempt to get up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go inside. Bye little guy. I love you.\u201d She placed a kiss on the Mudbray\u2019s head and walked out of the barn with Guzma following behind. Iris had stopped crying as they walked across the grass. She stepped to the door and threw it open.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower. You can after me if you want. We can probably find some old clothes of my brothers\u2019 for you to wear if you wanna wash yours.\u201d She walked through the ranch style house towards the bathroom and stepped inside.</p><p>After she had gotten dressed in her gray and green Magikarp t-shirt with her new pair of blue jean shorts. She had reached the living room to find Guzma nursing a glass of water.\u00a0\u201cMade yourself at home?\u201d He laughed and stretched his legs out onto the coffee table.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t mind. You want to find some clothes for you? Your clothes must be gross by now.\u201d It was true, they were soaked in sweat and sea water. They kinda looked like they hadn\u2019t been washed well for a while. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get me clothes. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She walked towards her brothers\u2019 room.\u00a0\u201cDude, I\u2019ll feel guilty if I don\u2019t.\u201d Her voice deepened a bit as she worried about him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He dragged the word out as he walked towards her and followed her into the room. She dug around in the closet before pulling out a black T-shirt and grey sweatpants. Iris tossed them at him and pushed him to the shower.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey! Watch it!\u201d He said, quickly flipping her off and hurrying in. </p><p>\u201cUse whatever products you want!\u201d She called. She walked to the couch and flopped down, sighing. It was hard knowing that Vee was dying. It would happen occasionally with Pokemon, and botulism almost always proved fatal.<br></p><p>She sat for a good 15 minutes before Guzma walked out with his clothes in his arms and wearing the ones she picked out. They were a bit too small, but not extreme.\u00a0\u201cYou live in Po Town, right?\u201d He nodded and sat down on the recliner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ll go ahead and wash your clothes for you.\u201d Iris stood up and took them out of his arms. It slightly surprised her that he didn\u2019t resist at all. Weird. She walked to the laundry room and turned on the machine once she put everything in. Walking back to the couch, she sat down. \u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes. You don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut I do need to worry about it, Guzma.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou have much bigger things to worry about. Now drop it.\u201d He looked serious and refused to make eye contact.<br></p><p>\u201cSo what? That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to help.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna leave it, are you?\u201d She shook her head and sat straighter.\u00a0\u201cYou gotta promise not to tell anyone. Madam Prez doesn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know how things can be. The gang hasn\u2019t been bringin\u2019 in so much money lately. We needed another source of income so everyone can eat. The President of Aether is offerin\u2019 to pay us to keep people away from certain areas. I\u2019m still tryin\u2019 to figure out what to do.\u201d Guzma scratched his black undercut and looked at the ground.<br></p><p>Iris had heard of Aether before. They were some conservation center who pledged to save Pokemon.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d say do it. Be careful though. Offers like that can be pretty risky.\u201d He nodded and stood up.</p><p>\u201cI better get goin. You can send my clothes to Po Town. Thanks for lettin\u2019 me wash em.\u201d She smiled at him and stood up.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to do that. Have a nice day, Guz.\u201d He walked to the door and left. Iris watched him go, feeling a slight pang of sadness. It was honestly really nice being around him. He wasn\u2019t as bad as people really made him out to be.<br></p><hr><hr><p>That took way too long for me to write. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to write Guzma but I think I\u2019m doing fine. Hope you enjoyed!</p></p>",

Tragedy strikes not too long after.</p><p><b>On the Ranch</b></p><p>\u201cPlease behave today.\u201d Iris patted Pixie, her shiny Mudsdale, on the neck as she led her into the round pen. She began to lunge her in a circle, making smooching noises to get her to trot.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon. You can do better than that!\u201d Pixie glanced at her and decided now was the perfect time to get mad.</p><p>She reared up and sped into a canter, bucking continuously as she circled around the pen. Iris struggled to stand her ground, skidding across the ground and just barely holding on to the lead rope.\u00a0\u201cI need some help over here!\u201d Damn, this was her biggest tantrum yet. She was yelling\u00a0\u201cWoah!\u201d to get the Pokemon to slow down, but she ignored her pleas. Pixie slowed down for second, distracted by something, allowing Iris to grab her Pokeball from her belt and throw it.\u00a0</p><p>The Pokeball captured Pixie, dropping the halter on the ground in her place. She walked over and stuffed the ball into her belt, wincing at her tired arms. A whistle sounded from behind her causing her to turn around.\u00a0\u201cNice job, when did\u2019ya get that one? Shiny, right?\u201d Guzma was leaning against a tree, smirking. She rolled her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbout three years ago, and she is indeed a shiny. When did you get here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, about 10 minutes ago. Figured I\u2019d grace you with my presence.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, Guz. I have more to do and you\u2019re helping me. You still know how to clean tack right?\u201d He rolled his eyes, causing her to giggle. He trudged after her towards the barn.</p><hr><p>It had taken hours to get done with tack and they were drenched with sweat by then. It was on their way out of the barn that Iris saw Guzma. She really saw him. His shirt was clinging to his sides, with his jacket clutched in his hand. He had gained a lot of muscle. He was well defined. Noticing that she was staring, she wrenched eyes away. No. Don\u2019t look at him like that. You only just found him again. He\u2019s just a friend and nothing more.\u00a0\u201cYou alright?\u201d She had stopped in her tracks and was staring at the ground.</p><p>Iris looked up to meet his eyes.\u00a0\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just got distracted. Want to grab a bite to eat?\u201d Concern flashed in his eyes before he suddenly became unreadable. They walked out before Iris yelled for her mother.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to get dinner. Call me if something happens!\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response before leaving.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWanna go for a swim first?\u201d Raising an eyebrow, she turned and put her hands on her hips.\u00a0\u201cHey, chill. I\u2019m not doing anything. It\u2019s just hot outside.\u201d Guzma raised his hands at her. She giggled as they made their way through Poni Plains, running through until they got to the Seafolk Village. Iris threw off her shirt and dropped her bag, leaving her in her sports bra and jeans.\u00a0</p><p>She plunged in and tread water until Guzma dove in. Iris normally would never do this but something about him made her feel safe and confident. She splashed him, which elicited an exaggerated gasp an a large splash in Iris\u2019 face. She splashed him as she dove under and made her way for the beach. Reaching it quickly, she focused on Guzma slowly swimming towards her. A whisper from behind her caught her attention.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d</p><p>Iris whipped her head around and saw the man who was whispering to a woman.\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know that Team Skull is dangerous. He\u2019s the worst one.\u201d He did not just say that! She marched up to them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBattle me! Sylveon!\u201d She threw out her Sylveon, who let out a high pitched chirp.\u00a0\u201cMoonblast!\u201d The move took out the Huntail that the trainer had just sent out immediately. She withdrew Sylveon just before a hand clamped onto her shoulder and pulled her away from the beach.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?!\u201d Iris shrugged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey were badmouthing you and I couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already ruinin you\u2019re reputation by hangin out with me! Do you realize this impacts you?\u201d She shook her head in annoyance and walked to grab her shirt and purse off of the docks, throwing them on and walking back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breathe, Guz. I don\u2019t care if they hate me. They\u2019ll learn to stop saying stuff like that.\u201d He clenched his fists at his sides and walked with her.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get food, big guy.\u201d She grabbed him by the hand and started to lead him to the docks when she realized how calloused and rough his hands were. They would feel nice around her thr- Shit, no. Don\u2019t think like that. No matter how hot he is, he has to be just a friend.

She accepted the call and lifted it to her ear.   \u201cVee is sick. You need to get home now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStay with him until I get there.

I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She walked towards her brothers\u2019 room.\u00a0\u201cDude, I\u2019ll feel guilty if I don\u2019t.\u201d Her voice deepened a bit as she worried about him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He dragged the word out as he walked towards her and followed her into the room. She dug around in the closet before pulling out a black T-shirt and grey sweatpants. Iris tossed them at him and pushed him to the shower.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey! Watch it!\u201d He said, quickly flipping her off and hurrying in. </p><p>\u201cUse whatever products you want!\u201d She called. She walked to the couch and flopped down, sighing. It was hard knowing that Vee was dying. It would happen occasionally with Pokemon, and botulism almost always proved fatal.<br></p><p>She sat for a good 15 minutes before Guzma walked out with his clothes in his arms and wearing the ones she picked out. They were a bit too small, but not extreme.\u00a0\u201cYou live in Po Town, right?\u201d He nodded and sat down on the recliner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ll go ahead and wash your clothes for you.\u201d Iris stood up and took them out of his arms. It slightly surprised her that he didn\u2019t resist at all. Weird. She walked to the laundry room and turned on the machine once she put everything in. Walking back to the couch, she sat down. \u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes. You don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut I do need to worry about it, Guzma.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou have much bigger things to worry about. Now drop it.\u201d He looked serious and refused to make eye contact.<br></p><p>\u201cSo what? That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to help.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna leave it, are you?\u201d She shook her head and sat straighter.\u00a0\u201cYou gotta promise not to tell anyone. Madam Prez doesn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know how things can be. The gang hasn\u2019t been bringin\u2019 in so much money lately. We needed another source of income so everyone can eat. The President of Aether is offerin\u2019 to pay us to keep people away from certain areas. I\u2019m still tryin\u2019 to figure out what to do.\u201d Guzma scratched his black undercut and looked at the ground.<br></p><p>Iris had heard of Aether before. They were some conservation center who pledged to save Pokemon.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d say do it. Be careful though. Offers like that can be pretty risky.\u201d He nodded and stood up.</p><p>\u201cI better get goin. You can send my clothes to Po Town. Thanks for lettin\u2019 me wash em.\u201d She smiled at him and stood up.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to do that. Have a nice day, Guz.\u201d He walked to the door and left. Iris watched him go, feeling a slight pang of sadness. It was honestly really nice being around him. He wasn\u2019t as bad as people really made him out to be.<br></p><hr><hr><p>That took way too long for me to write. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to write Guzma but I think I\u2019m doing fine. Hope you enjoyed!</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>You&rsquo;re Meant for Me pt. 2</h2><p>This is part two of my Guzma/Original character fanfiction!</p><p>Warnings: Cussing, Money Issues, and Pokemon Death</p><p>Pairings: Guzma/OC</p><p>Summary: Iris is on the ranch and gets visited by a very expected visitor. Tragedy strikes not too long after.</p><p><b>On the Ranch</b></p><p>&ldquo;Please behave today.&rdquo; Iris patted Pixie, her shiny Mudsdale, on the neck as she led her into the round pen. She began to lunge her in a circle, making smooching noises to get her to trot.&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon. You can do better than that!&rdquo; Pixie glanced at her and decided now was the perfect time to get mad.</p><p>She reared up and sped into a canter, bucking continuously as she circled around the pen. Iris struggled to stand her ground, skidding across the ground and just barely holding on to the lead rope.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need some help over here!&rdquo; Damn, this was her biggest tantrum yet. She was yelling&nbsp;&ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; to get the Pokemon to slow down, but she ignored her pleas. Pixie slowed down for second, distracted by something, allowing Iris to grab her Pokeball from her belt and throw it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pokeball captured Pixie, dropping the halter on the ground in her place. She walked over and stuffed the ball into her belt, wincing at her tired arms. A whistle sounded from behind her causing her to turn around.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nice job, when did&rsquo;ya get that one? Shiny, right?&rdquo; Guzma was leaning against a tree, smirking. She rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;About three years ago, and she is indeed a shiny. When did you get here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, about 10 minutes ago. Figured I&rsquo;d grace you with my presence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Guz. I have more to do and you&rsquo;re helping me. You still know how to clean tack right?&rdquo; He rolled his eyes, causing her to giggle. He trudged after her towards the barn.</p><hr /><p>It had taken hours to get done with tack and they were drenched with sweat by then. It was on their way out of the barn that Iris saw Guzma. She really saw him. His shirt was clinging to his sides, with his jacket clutched in his hand. He had gained a lot of muscle. He was well defined. Noticing that she was staring, she wrenched eyes away. No. Don&rsquo;t look at him like that. You only just found him again. He&rsquo;s just a friend and nothing more.&nbsp;&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; She had stopped in her tracks and was staring at the ground.</p><p>Iris looked up to meet his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine. Just got distracted. Want to grab a bite to eat?&rdquo; Concern flashed in his eyes before he suddenly became unreadable. They walked out before Iris yelled for her mother.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get dinner. Call me if something happens!&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t wait for a response before leaving.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna go for a swim first?&rdquo; Raising an eyebrow, she turned and put her hands on her hips.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, chill. I&rsquo;m not doing anything. It&rsquo;s just hot outside.&rdquo; Guzma raised his hands at her. She giggled as they made their way through Poni Plains, running through until they got to the Seafolk Village. Iris threw off her shirt and dropped her bag, leaving her in her sports bra and jeans.&nbsp;</p><p>She plunged in and tread water until Guzma dove in. Iris normally would never do this but something about him made her feel safe and confident. She splashed him, which elicited an exaggerated gasp an a large splash in Iris&rsquo; face. She splashed him as she dove under and made her way for the beach. Reaching it quickly, she focused on Guzma slowly swimming towards her. A whisper from behind her caught her attention.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him!&rdquo;</p><p>Iris whipped her head around and saw the man who was whispering to a woman.&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know that Team Skull is dangerous. He&rsquo;s the worst one.&rdquo; He did not just say that! She marched up to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Battle me! Sylveon!&rdquo; She threw out her Sylveon, who let out a high pitched chirp.&nbsp;&ldquo;Moonblast!&rdquo; The move took out the Huntail that the trainer had just sent out immediately. She withdrew Sylveon just before a hand clamped onto her shoulder and pulled her away from the beach.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck was that?!&rdquo; Iris shrugged.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They were badmouthing you and I couldn&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re already ruinin you&rsquo;re reputation by hangin out with me! Do you realize this impacts you?&rdquo; She shook her head in annoyance and walked to grab her shirt and purse off of the docks, throwing them on and walking back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Take a deep breathe, Guz. I don&rsquo;t care if they hate me. They&rsquo;ll learn to stop saying stuff like that.&rdquo; He clenched his fists at his sides and walked with her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get food, big guy.&rdquo; She grabbed him by the hand and started to lead him to the docks when she realized how calloused and rough his hands were. They would feel nice around her thr- Shit, no. Don&rsquo;t think like that. No matter how hot he is, he has to be just a friend. She pulled him to The Boat, her favorite restaurant, and let go of his hand, nudging him inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! What would you like to-&rdquo; The boy at the counter stopped speaking as he noticed who was in front of him. A worried expression crossed his face as Guzma walked towards the counter. Iris hurried up beside him quickly,&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with me. You don&rsquo;t need to worry.&rdquo; His expression lightened slightly,&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Iris! Nice to see you! I take it you want the usual?&rdquo; She grinned and nodded,&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take whatever she&rsquo;s getting.&rdquo; They walked upstairs to the&nbsp;&lsquo;VIP&rsquo; seating. It was nothing fancy, but she got to sit there due to the fact that she often delivered groceries with Pixie to the restaurant.&nbsp;&ldquo;So uh, I guess you stay at Po Town with the rest of Team Skull?&rdquo; Iris raised her eyebrows at Guzma.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah I do. They&rsquo;re family to me.&rdquo; He was slouching even more as the food was brought over, as if he was trying to hide his face. Iris dug into the large bowl, as if she was starving. Guzma had already eaten his by the time she was done.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn you eat faster than me.&rdquo; She copied his accent. It was hard to put into words. He let out a chuckle, and grinned at her.&nbsp;</p><p>She stood up and walked to the counter with Guzma. He went to take cash out of his pocket when she stopped him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo; He sighed in protest and let his arms hang by his sides. Iris took the two heart scales and shoved them into her bag. They had just stepped out of the restaurant when her phone started to ring. She accepted the call and lifted it to her ear.   &ldquo;Vee is sick. You need to get home now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stay with him until I get there. Bye, Mom.&rdquo; Grabbing Guzma&rsquo;s hand, she pulled him along the dock.&nbsp;&ldquo;Something is up with our newborn Mudbray and we need to get back to the ranch.&rdquo; She threw out Pixie&rsquo;s Pokeball and hopped onto her once she appeared. Iris reached her hand out for Guzma and pulled him on.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hold on tight!&rdquo; She kicked Pixie in the sides, making her bolt. Guzma instinctively grabbed her waist for a moment, making Iris blush. No time to react. Focus on Pixie.</p><p>She smooched repetitively at Pixie to get her to go faster. The ride was rough and bouncy, making it increasingly more awkward for the two. </p><p>When they finally arrived, she recalled Pixie and ran to the barn with Guzma.&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened?!&rdquo; Vee was laying in the middle of the barn, struggling to breathe.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Botulism. He probably won&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo; Her mom was standing over Vee. Iris dropped to her knees and leaned over Vee with her hair hiding her face. He was struggling to breath and would flail his legs around. The sight of a sick Mudbray is one that you don&rsquo;t want to see. It was pitiful. The once playful Pokemon was struggling to even live.</p><p>Iris let out an ugly sob. It all came out at once as she looked at the state he was in. His eyes were growing dull. She put her head on his side and intertwined her fingers in his fur.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, buddy. You sweet little thing.&rdquo; An arm wrapped around her shoulder and pulled her closer.</p><p>&ldquo;It probably won&rsquo;t work but I have a full restore we can try if it&rsquo;ll make you feel better.&rdquo; She looked up at Guzma and put her hand out. He placed the full restore in her hand. She sprayed it on Vee. He relaxed but that was it. Petting him, she looked at Guzma.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think it at least took the pain away.&rdquo; Guzma pulled her close again and pet Vee.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m planning to stay out here with him. Might get Nurse Joy out here to see if there&rsquo;s anything we can do.&rdquo; Her mother crouched down and pet Vee.&nbsp;&ldquo;Coconut! Come here!&rdquo; Her mom called for her beloved Mudsdale and mother of Vee. The beautiful and fit Mare trotted in and nickered for Vee, making him flail and attempt to get up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go inside. Bye little guy. I love you.&rdquo; She placed a kiss on the Mudbray&rsquo;s head and walked out of the barn with Guzma following behind. Iris had stopped crying as they walked across the grass. She stepped to the door and threw it open.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna take a shower. You can after me if you want. We can probably find some old clothes of my brothers&rsquo; for you to wear if you wanna wash yours.&rdquo; She walked through the ranch style house towards the bathroom and stepped inside.</p><p>After she had gotten dressed in her gray and green Magikarp t-shirt with her new pair of blue jean shorts. She had reached the living room to find Guzma nursing a glass of water.&nbsp;&ldquo;Made yourself at home?&rdquo; He laughed and stretched his legs out onto the coffee table.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. You want to find some clothes for you? Your clothes must be gross by now.&rdquo; It was true, they were soaked in sweat and sea water. They kinda looked like they hadn&rsquo;t been washed well for a while. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to get me clothes. I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; She walked towards her brothers&rsquo; room.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dude, I&rsquo;ll feel guilty if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Her voice deepened a bit as she worried about him.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; He dragged the word out as he walked towards her and followed her into the room. She dug around in the closet before pulling out a black T-shirt and grey sweatpants. Iris tossed them at him and pushed him to the shower.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!
