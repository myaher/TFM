On this sunny day you and your boyfriend Iida had decided to go biking through the park. </p><p>Iida has mounted a little picnic basket on his bike and your heart warms at how happy he looks. </p><p>You look over at the trail of the park, the skirt of your sundress slightly moving in the wind. </p><p>\u201cAre ready to go y/n?\u201d Iida asks. You look over it him, he\u2019s wearing a thick helmet and protective clothes. A shade of red is already showing on his face from the heat. </p><p>You nod your head, holding a giggle back. You move to step on your bike, realizing just how difficult that could be. Your short stature struggling to get onto the seat of the bike, making you jump a little. </p><p>Iida watches you and is about to ask if you need help when your skirt gets caught on the seat, lifting up and by that exposing your panties. You yelp and look back at him, a blush spreading over your face. You quickly stroke the fabric back down while Iida averts his gaze to the side.</p><p><br></p><p>You try to get up again, this time the breeze lifting your skirt up together with your tiny jumps. \u201cCome on!\u201d You whine, feeling embarrassed. You lock eyes with Iida while you move away from the bike. </p><p>His face has become several shades redder and you are pretty sure it\u2019s not because of the heat.</p><p>Your eyes can\u2019t help but dart down, noticing the obvious bulge in his tight shorts. \u201cA-Ah Maybe we can sit down first.\u201d You stutter and Iida quickly nods his head. </p><p><br></p><p>Your bikes are parked against a tree as you sit next to each other on the blanket that Iida has spread over the grass. </p><p>Iida has thankfully taken off his helmet. </p><p>He stares at you intensely with the same shade of red as before, making you feel anxious. The way he is looking at you is making heat pool between your legs, wondering if he\u2019s going to make a move. </p><p>Iida leans in to give you a kiss, gently pressing his lips against yours. Your eyes dart from side to side, noticing no one is near, and if they were you are hidden well between a ring of bushes. </p><p>With this confirmation, you grab onto the back of Iida\u2019s neck, pushing his lips against yours harder as you eagerly open your mouth slightly for his tongue to enter. He stutters against you for a moment before noticing the same as you did, giving into the passionate kiss. Your tongues explore each other\u2019s mouth as one of his hands moves to lay on your thigh. Iida rubs it and gives it soft squeezes, drawing soft moans from you. You feel the excitement in your lower stomach growing as his hand slowly moves under your skirt. Your breath hitches in your throat, feeling him slide one finger over your panties. </p><p>Iida checks if there is someone multiple times during this, relieved when there isn\u2019t. The heat in his cheeks, and in his pants, grows as he feels your slit through your panties. You shudder from his touch as he keeps stroking over your pussy, making you get wetter by the second. </p><p>Iida pulls away from the kiss, looking you in the eye. Both of you are showing eyes full of desire and flushed cheeks. </p><p>He feels the wetness soaking through your panties, making him groan. You bite your lip impatiently and he moves his hand away. You whine and give him a desperate look but Iida shakes his head. \u201cNot here\u2026 Maybe I can take you home though?\u201d He says and you give him a smile, nodding your head. </p><p>Forget about the biking, you have something else in mind that you want to write. </p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nThe Todoroki kids sans Shouto (and Dabi lulz) visited their mom at the hospital\nand awkwardly discussed Endeavor officially becoming the #1 hero. Shouto\u2019s\nolder brother Natsuo wasn\u2019t happy about it, saying that the world doesn\u2019t know\nabout \u201cwhat he did\u201d and how he treated his family. But interestingly, Rei came\nto his defense, saying that things were more complex than that. She said she\ndoesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in his heart, \u201cbut he hasn\u2019t left us behind.\u201d We\nthen cut to Endeavor\u2019s fight with the High Tide Noumu, which basically\nconsisted of Endeavor hovering for a few seconds with his flames, and then\ngetting very violently flung through a building. Like, he was basically used as\na human laser saw to cut the top of this high rise clean off. A bunch\nof people nearly fell to their deaths, but thankfully Hawks saved them all with\nhis ridiculously OP Mighty Wings quirk. Speaking of Hawks, idk but it sure is\nsome shifty bullshit that Your Highness Noumu just <i>happened</i> to attack him and Endeavor in this building right when\nthey were having a chitchat about Noumus. Something is definitely up you guys.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor continues to battle the High Heaven Noumu and pulls off some impressive feats, such as dicing a falling building into tiny pieces with his flames so that the spectators below don\u2019t get crushed. Unfortunately these techniques come at a price, and he finds himself beginning to struggle due to the heat building up in his body. Meanwhile the High Hopes Noumu remains mostly unfazed, even dispatching a\u00a0bunch of disgusting slimy clone things to wreak some havoc and distract Hawks and the other pros on the scene so that they can\u2019t assist. Realizing he has no choice but to Go For It, Endeavor powers up his flames and hits the Noumu with massive flame attack: Prominence Burn. Unfortunately the Noumu anticipates his actions and is able to avoid being completely disintegrated. He regenerates, and then brutally slashes/stabs Endeavor in the most ironic spots possible &ndash; his torso (nearly the same place where All Might was wounded by AFO), and his left eye (don\u2019t think I have to explain this one lol). It\u2019s all very violent, and probably not the sort of thing you\u2019d want your child to witness on live television &ndash; oh hey there Shouto. Didn\u2019t see you there. Uh&hellip; well, shit.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

Shouto\u2019s\nolder brother Natsuo wasn\u2019t happy about it, saying that the world doesn\u2019t know\nabout \u201cwhat he did\u201d and how he treated his family. But interestingly, Rei came\nto his defense, saying that things were more complex than that. She said she\ndoesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in his heart, \u201cbut he hasn\u2019t left us behind.\u201d We\nthen cut to Endeavor\u2019s fight with the High Tide Noumu, which basically\nconsisted of Endeavor hovering for a few seconds with his flames, and then\ngetting very violently flung through a building. Like, he was basically used as\na human laser saw to cut the top of this high rise clean off. A bunch\nof people nearly fell to their deaths, but thankfully Hawks saved them all with\nhis ridiculously OP Mighty Wings quirk. Speaking of Hawks, idk but it sure is\nsome shifty bullshit that Your Highness Noumu just <i>happened</i> to attack him and Endeavor in this building right when\nthey were having a chitchat about Noumus. Something is definitely up you guys.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor continues to battle the High Heaven Noumu and pulls off some impressive feats, such as dicing a falling building into tiny pieces with his flames so that the spectators below don\u2019t get crushed. Unfortunately these techniques come at a price, and he finds himself beginning to struggle due to the heat building up in his body. Meanwhile the High Hopes Noumu remains mostly unfazed, even dispatching a\u00a0bunch of disgusting slimy clone things to wreak some havoc and distract Hawks and the other pros on the scene so that they can\u2019t assist. Realizing he has no choice but to Go For It, Endeavor powers up his flames and hits the Noumu with massive flame attack: Prominence Burn. Unfortunately the Noumu anticipates his actions and is able to avoid being completely disintegrated. He regenerates, and then brutally slashes/stabs Endeavor in the most ironic spots possible \u2013 his torso (nearly the same place where All Might was wounded by AFO), and his left eye (don\u2019t think I have to explain this one lol). It\u2019s all very violent, and probably not the sort of thing you\u2019d want your child to witness on live television \u2013 oh hey there Shouto. Didn\u2019t see you there.

                "content": "<p><p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nThe Todoroki kids sans Shouto (and Dabi lulz) visited their mom at the hospital\nand awkwardly discussed Endeavor officially becoming the #1 hero. Shouto&rsquo;s\nolder brother Natsuo wasn&rsquo;t happy about it, saying that the world doesn&rsquo;t know\nabout &ldquo;what he did&rdquo; and how he treated his family. But interestingly, Rei came\nto his defense, saying that things were more complex than that. She said she\ndoesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in his heart, &ldquo;but he hasn&rsquo;t left us behind.&rdquo; We\nthen cut to Endeavor&rsquo;s fight with the High Tide Noumu, which basically\nconsisted of Endeavor hovering for a few seconds with his flames, and then\ngetting very violently flung through a building. Like, he was basically used as\na human laser saw to cut the top of this high rise clean off. A bunch\nof people nearly fell to their deaths, but thankfully Hawks saved them all with\nhis ridiculously OP Mighty Wings quirk. Speaking of Hawks, idk but it sure is\nsome shifty bullshit that Your Highness Noumu just <i>happened</i> to attack him and Endeavor in this building right when\nthey were having a chitchat about Noumus. Something is definitely up you guys.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor continues to battle the High Heaven Noumu and pulls off some impressive feats, such as dicing a falling building into tiny pieces with his flames so that the spectators below don&rsquo;t get crushed. Unfortunately these techniques come at a price, and he finds himself beginning to struggle due to the heat building up in his body. Meanwhile the High Hopes Noumu remains mostly unfazed, even dispatching a&nbsp;bunch of disgusting slimy clone things to wreak some havoc and distract Hawks and the other pros on the scene so that they can&rsquo;t assist. Realizing he has no choice but to Go For It, Endeavor powers up his flames and hits the Noumu with massive flame attack: Prominence Burn. Unfortunately the Noumu anticipates his actions and is able to avoid being completely disintegrated. He regenerates, and then brutally slashes/stabs Endeavor in the most ironic spots possible &ndash; his torso (nearly the same place where All Might was wounded by AFO), and his left eye (don&rsquo;t think I have to explain this one lol). It&rsquo;s all very violent, and probably not the sort of thing you&rsquo;d want your child to witness on live television &ndash; oh hey there Shouto. Didn&rsquo;t see you there.

Shouto&rsquo;s\nolder brother Natsuo wasn&rsquo;t happy about it, saying that the world doesn&rsquo;t know\nabout &ldquo;what he did&rdquo; and how he treated his family. But interestingly, Rei came\nto his defense, saying that things were more complex than that. She said she\ndoesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in his heart, &ldquo;but he hasn&rsquo;t left us behind.&rdquo; We\nthen cut to Endeavor&rsquo;s fight with the High Tide Noumu, which basically\nconsisted of Endeavor hovering for a few seconds with his flames, and then\ngetting very violently flung through a building. Like, he was basically used as\na human laser saw to cut the top of this high rise clean off. A bunch\nof people nearly fell to their deaths, but thankfully Hawks saved them all with\nhis ridiculously OP Mighty Wings quirk. Speaking of Hawks, idk but it sure is\nsome shifty bullshit that Your Highness Noumu just <i>happened</i> to attack him and Endeavor in this building right when\nthey were having a chitchat about Noumus. Something is definitely up you guys.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor continues to battle the High Heaven Noumu and pulls off some impressive feats, such as dicing a falling building into tiny pieces with his flames so that the spectators below don&rsquo;t get crushed. Unfortunately these techniques come at a price, and he finds himself beginning to struggle due to the heat building up in his body. Meanwhile the High Hopes Noumu remains mostly unfazed, even dispatching a&nbsp;bunch of disgusting slimy clone things to wreak some havoc and distract Hawks and the other pros on the scene so that they can&rsquo;t assist. Realizing he has no choice but to Go For It, Endeavor powers up his flames and hits the Noumu with massive flame attack: Prominence Burn. Unfortunately the Noumu anticipates his actions and is able to avoid being completely disintegrated. He regenerates, and then brutally slashes/stabs Endeavor in the most ironic spots possible &ndash; his torso (nearly the same place where All Might was wounded by AFO), and his left eye (don&rsquo;t think I have to explain this one lol). It&rsquo;s all very violent, and probably not the sort of thing you&rsquo;d want your child to witness on live television &ndash; oh hey there Shouto. Didn&rsquo;t see you there.

She has short black hair in an undercut and bright purple, upturned eyes. Her legs have a bird-like appearance with scaly skin, very sharp talons and an anisodactyl toe arrangement.<br/>Her Yuuei uniform is sleeveless and it can open along the seams on the sides so it doesn&rsquo;t rip when has to activate her Quirk while in uniform.<br/><br/><b>Personality<br/></b><br/>Ambitious | Prideful | Sporty | Hardworking | Competitive<br/><br/>Fuuro is extremely law-abiding and makes sure to follow rules set by authority at all times. If it isn&rsquo;t about rules then she is fairly reasonable.<br/>However she is not above pointless arguments and will often treat a discussion about trivial things too seriously. She tends to overlook any flaws of the people she idolizes greatly, like her mother and tends to be overly formal and reserved around them. Insulting those people greatly enrages her and if someone does so continually she will loose her temper. She won&rsquo;t get violent usually but she can get very vocal when angry. She can see her own actions critically and also that of most other people (if she doesn&rsquo;t happen to idolize them) so she is generally a good choice when you need an objective second opinion.<br/>Fuuro very often tells herself that she prefers to work alone since her mother also works alone and she aspires to be like her but she always feels a certain comfort having someone by her side or watch her back. She can generally work well with others and is perfect for organizing teamwork as she has just the right authoritative presence to ensure that everyone is doing their part diligently.<br/>She takes pride in her own abilites and accomplishments. Because she is a bit vain when it comes to that, it is very easy to get on her good side with flattery and compliments.<br/>For people who don&rsquo;t know her she often appears stoic and unapproachable with a stone-cold, serious expression and she tends to keep that image up around strangers because she wants to appear as someone admirable and authoritative. She only loosens up when around friends or her family. When she is comfortable and doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to appear stern and control her expression, her emotions are very often painfully obvious in her face.<br/>She finds it very easy to motivate herself. She enjoys challenging her own limits and regularily does so even if in a controlled manner. She sees stepping out of one&rsquo;s boundaries as a way to improve and exceed yourself.<br/>She is ready to face pressure and obstacles in her way to become a hero so she isn&rsquo;t really that affected by pressure. She is determined to finish assigned tasks as quick as possible and works diligently and restlessly on them. She&rsquo;s not a person that regularily slacks off.<br/><br/><i>Likes</i> <br/>-Punk fashion<br/>-Sweets<br/>-Storms<br/>-Nighttime<br/>-Meat (especially rabbit meat) <br/>-Rainy nights<br/>-The feeling of blowing wind<br/><br/><i>Dislikes</i><br/>-Ghost stories<br/>-Rule-breakers<br/>-People who don&rsquo;t want to leave their comfort zone <br/>-Mornings<br/>-The nicknames her brother gives her<br/>-Insects<br/><br/><b>Quirk</b><br/><i>Owl Wings</i></p><p>Fuuro&rsquo;s Quirk allows her to transform her arms into owl wings with dark-grey/black feathers. When her Quirk is not active her arms have tiny black feathers protruding from the skin.</p><p><b>Advantage:</b></p><p>+ She can fly for a very long time</p><p>+ Her owl-like wings allow her to fly completely soundless which makes her a great suprise-attacker</p><p>+ Her arm muscles take a very long time to get tired</p><p>+She can easily defend herself against enemies with gas-based Quirks (can blow it away)</p><p>+She is also a good support for allies with a gas-based Quirk (can quickly blow it in the direction of the enemy)</p><p><b>Disadvantage:</b></p><p>- Carrying extra weight exhausts her quickly. She doesn&rsquo;t mind one kilogramm or two. But everything over 5 kg drastically cuts her flying time. If she has to carry another person, she can maybe manage to fly for a couple of minutes before her wings give out.</p><p>- Her bones are lighter and thus more fragile, making her less suited for defense</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Backstory:</b></p><p>Fuuro&rsquo;s mother is a hero herself while her father, who is quirkless, works as a police officer.</p><p>Lawfullness practically ran in her family. She also has a younger brother.</p><p>Her mother Quirk lets her grow black-feathered wings on her back with which she can fly completely soundless and just like Fuuro has bird-like legs, though they are even more bird-like in structure than Fuuro&rsquo;s. Additionally Asuka has feathery hair.</p><p>Fuuro&rsquo;s Quirk manifested on a family trip while they were hiking. She climbed up a very high tree and was just enjoying the scenery when her Quirk manifested and she grew little feathers on her arms and her legs changed into the bird legs she has today. She noticed this and by chance transformed her arms into wings. She was absolutely thrilled, having looked up to her mother all her life and now she inherited her Quirk.</p><p>When her mother called out to her that they wanted to continue the hike, she flew down from the tree. Her mother was overjoyed, as was her father. At the end of the trip Fuuro&rsquo;s hiking shoes were in shambles since her talons cut through them. She felt a bit bad about it, since they were kind of expensive. Afterwards her mother took her under her wing, quite literally.</p><p>Her younger brother remained quirkless and he eventually decided to pursue a career as a lawyer while Fuuro aimed to become a hero like her mother.</p><p>She brought herself in good physical shape by following a strict work-out schedule that her mother occasionally helped her with and studied very hard to get into Yuuei, where her mother had also studied. At Yuuei she entered the class 1-A (a year before the main cast enters the school, she is in 2-A during the story) and made friends amongst her classmates and even one outside the school. Two of them being Fukasu and Shinju. She eventually developed a crush on the latter. After being convinced by Fukasu she confessed to her and the two have been in a relationship ever since.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Relationships</b></p><p><i>Family</i></p><p>Kuroba Asuka - mother</p><p>Fuuro greatly idolized her mother. She looks up to her for risking her life on a daily basis for the greater good. She aspires to be like her mother and maybe take her place when she gets old. Fuuro tends to praise her to high heaven&rsquo;s and doesn&rsquo;t see any flaws that she might have.</p><p>Her mother is naturally very proud of what her daughter manages to achieve by following in her footsteps but silently wishes she&rsquo;d try and be her own hero instead of imitating her.</p><p>Asuka spends a lot of time with her daughter but despite that their relationship is more like that of a teacher and student rather than mother and daughter which makes Asuka sad. Fuuro on the other hand doesn&rsquo;t appear to be bothered by the formal and almost distant relationship she has with her mother.</p><p><br/></p><p>Kuroba Yuuto - father</p><p>Fuuro looks up to her father as well but not to the extreme degree she does with her mother, ultimately making her relationship with him more &ldquo;family-like&rdquo;.</p><p>Yuuto is aware that Asuka is not happy about her current relationship with Fuuro and tries his best to convince his daughter to treat her mother more like a mother and communicate between the two without telling Fuuro explicitly how her mother feels because he knows Fuuro will think she has disappointed her mother in some way, which would only make the whole ordeal worse.</p><p><br/></p><p>Kuroba Souma - younger brother</p><p>Souma doesn&rsquo;t hold any grudges against his sister for inheriting their mother&rsquo;s Quirk even though he turned out to be quirkless.</p><p>The two often bicker but mostly about trivial things and they don&rsquo;t get too insulting, usually.</p><p>Souma has always made an effort to get better grades than Fuuro to show her that even if she has a Quirk and is more physically fit, he is the smarter one. His favourite nickname for Fuuro is &ldquo;birdbrain&rdquo; but he makes sure not to use it when their mother is around since she doesn&rsquo;t like it when he calls her that. Even though he aspires to be a lawyer he doesn&rsquo;t mind when he unintentionally (or intentionally) commits a minor misdemeanor. His nonchalant attitude about this and Fuuro&rsquo;s overbearing law-abidingness are very often the cause of their bickering.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>OCs</i></p><p>Hokori Fukasu - friend</p><p>They often hang out at Shinju&rsquo;s place together, but not so much with just the two of them.</p><p>If it weren&rsquo;t for Shinju the two of them probably would have never met. Fukasu finds Fuuro entertaining and often makes stupid dares with her (nothing that would break any rules though). Fukasu&rsquo;s carefree attitude reminds Fuuro of her brother, which can be a good and a bad thing. She and Fuuro share a love for sweets</p><p>Fuuro got to know her when doing organisational work with Shinju at her place as Fukasu and her mother live there as well. Fukasu immidiately noticed that Shinju and Fuuro had a thing for each other. Fuuro is very thankful that she convinced her to confess to Shinju. Fukasu now is the designated &ldquo;third wheel&rdquo; whenever they hang out, but she doesn&rsquo;t mind it.</p><p><br/></p><p>Abe Shinju - girlfriend</p><p>They have been together since the end of their first year.<br/>The two first started talking to each other when Shinju became the class president and Fuuro the vice class president. Fuuro also befriended a childhood friend of Shinju: Fukasu who attended Shiketsu High and whom she met at times when meeting at Shinju&rsquo;s place.<br/>The two started spending even more time with each other and got to know each other better. Having to organize class events together both of them learned how to rely on each other.<br/>Shinju quickly finds herself enarmoured with Fuuro and her ambitious and motivational nature. Fuuro on the other hand falls for her over time, becoming smitten with Shinju&rsquo;s elegance and the way she carries herself as well as her caring and gentle nature.<br/>Fukasu has noticed the two developed feelings for each other and, after watching Fuuro make hearteyes at Shinju day after day, she eventually convinced Fuuro to make a move and the two got together.<br/>Fuuro loves Shinju&rsquo;s smile, her eyes. She often strokes her scales absent-mindedly when they cuddle. Shinju loves being carried around and held by Fuuro. It makes her feel safe and secure. She&rsquo;d love Fuuro to fly around with her but knows that her girlfriend has limits in her strength so that is only a dream (for now).<br/>With Fuuro Shinju feels comfortable enough to talk about personal things, such as her father. Fuuro knows when to let Shinju have her alone time, just as Shinju knows that Fuuro needs her time for her frequent training. Both know they can rely on and trust the other.<br/>Shinju may see the value in simple things but she occasionally buys Fuuro expensive gifts, just to impress her girlfriend a little.<br/>Since both have an interest for fashion (albeit different styles) they like going shopping together. Fuuro sometimes takes Shinju out to eat at small, local restaurants which Shinju is fascinated by, only being used to either eating at home or going to expensive restaurants.<br/>At the end of a day the two also enjoy taking long walks on the beach together, Fuuro watching lovingly as Shinju excitedly collects various seashells.</p><p><b>Trivia</b></p><ul><li>Fuuro is bisexual</li><li>She often trains her Quirk by strapping increasingly heavier weights to herself and flying around for as long as she can</li><li>Her love for punk fashion and intimidating appearance often give her the image of a delinquent when in reality she is a very law-abiding person and chastises even the smallest offense to the law</li><li>In her childhood a lot of socks and shoes ended up ripped and cut due to her very sharp talons so she stopped wearing them all together</li><li>She attacks like an owl, with her feet first</li><li>She has a habit of perching on high places</li><li>She is not a morning person</li><li>She tends to screw up her sleeping schedule by staying up too late</li></ul>",

She has short black hair in an undercut and bright purple, upturned eyes. Her legs have a bird-like appearance with scaly skin, very sharp talons and an anisodactyl toe arrangement.<br>Her Yuuei uniform is sleeveless and it can open along the seams on the sides so it doesn\u2019t rip when has to activate her Quirk while in uniform.<br><br><b>Personality<br></b><br>Ambitious | Prideful | Sporty | Hardworking | Competitive<br><br>Fuuro is extremely law-abiding and makes sure to follow rules set by authority at all times. If it isn\u2019t about rules then she is fairly reasonable.<br>However she is not above pointless arguments and will often treat a discussion about trivial things too seriously. She tends to overlook any flaws of the people she idolizes greatly, like her mother and tends to be overly formal and reserved around them. Insulting those people greatly enrages her and if someone does so continually she will loose her temper. She won\u2019t get violent usually but she can get very vocal when angry. She can see her own actions critically and also that of most other people (if she doesn\u2019t happen to idolize them) so she is generally a good choice when you need an objective second opinion.<br>Fuuro very often tells herself that she prefers to work alone since her mother also works alone and she aspires to be like her but she always feels a certain comfort having someone by her side or watch her back. She can generally work well with others and is perfect for organizing teamwork as she has just the right authoritative presence to ensure that everyone is doing their part diligently.<br>She takes pride in her own abilites and accomplishments. Because she is a bit vain when it comes to that, it is very easy to get on her good side with flattery and compliments.<br>For people who don\u2019t know her she often appears stoic and unapproachable with a stone-cold, serious expression and she tends to keep that image up around strangers because she wants to appear as someone admirable and authoritative. She only loosens up when around friends or her family. When she is comfortable and doesn\u2019t feel the need to appear stern and control her expression, her emotions are very often painfully obvious in her face.<br>She finds it very easy to motivate herself. She enjoys challenging her own limits and regularily does so even if in a controlled manner. She sees stepping out of one\u2019s boundaries as a way to improve and exceed yourself.<br>She is ready to face pressure and obstacles in her way to become a hero so she isn\u2019t really that affected by pressure. She is determined to finish assigned tasks as quick as possible and works diligently and restlessly on them. She\u2019s not a person that regularily slacks off.<br><br><i>Likes</i> <br>-Punk fashion<br>-Sweets<br>-Storms<br>-Nighttime<br>-Meat (especially rabbit meat) <br>-Rainy nights<br>-The feeling of blowing wind<br><br><i>Dislikes</i><br>-Ghost stories<br>-Rule-breakers<br>-People who don\u2019t want to leave their comfort zone <br>-Mornings<br>-The nicknames her brother gives her<br>-Insects<br><br><b>Quirk</b><br><i>Owl Wings</i></p><p>Fuuro\u2019s Quirk allows her to transform her arms into owl wings with dark-grey/black feathers. When her Quirk is not active her arms have tiny black feathers protruding from the skin.</p><p><b>Advantage:</b></p><p>+ She can fly for a very long time</p><p>+ Her owl-like wings allow her to fly completely soundless which makes her a great suprise-attacker</p><p>+ Her arm muscles take a very long time to get tired</p><p>+She can easily defend herself against enemies with gas-based Quirks (can blow it away)</p><p>+She is also a good support for allies with a gas-based Quirk (can quickly blow it in the direction of the enemy)</p><p><b>Disadvantage:</b></p><p>- Carrying extra weight exhausts her quickly. She doesn\u2019t mind one kilogramm or two. But everything over 5 kg drastically cuts her flying time. If she has to carry another person, she can maybe manage to fly for a couple of minutes before her wings give out.</p><p>- Her bones are lighter and thus more fragile, making her less suited for defense</p><p><br></p><p><b>Backstory:</b></p><p>Fuuro\u2019s mother is a hero herself while her father, who is quirkless, works as a police officer.</p><p>Lawfullness practically ran in her family. She also has a younger brother.</p><p>Her mother Quirk lets her grow black-feathered wings on her back with which she can fly completely soundless and just like Fuuro has bird-like legs, though they are even more bird-like in structure than Fuuro\u2019s. Additionally Asuka has feathery hair.</p><p>Fuuro\u2019s Quirk manifested on a family trip while they were hiking. She climbed up a very high tree and was just enjoying the scenery when her Quirk manifested and she grew little feathers on her arms and her legs changed into the bird legs she has today. She noticed this and by chance transformed her arms into wings. She was absolutely thrilled, having looked up to her mother all her life and now she inherited her Quirk.</p><p>When her mother called out to her that they wanted to continue the hike, she flew down from the tree. Her mother was overjoyed, as was her father. At the end of the trip Fuuro\u2019s hiking shoes were in shambles since her talons cut through them. She felt a bit bad about it, since they were kind of expensive. Afterwards her mother took her under her wing, quite literally.</p><p>Her younger brother remained quirkless and he eventually decided to pursue a career as a lawyer while Fuuro aimed to become a hero like her mother.</p><p>She brought herself in good physical shape by following a strict work-out schedule that her mother occasionally helped her with and studied very hard to get into Yuuei, where her mother had also studied. At Yuuei she entered the class 1-A (a year before the main cast enters the school, she is in 2-A during the story) and made friends amongst her classmates and even one outside the school. Two of them being Fukasu and Shinju. She eventually developed a crush on the latter. After being convinced by Fukasu she confessed to her and the two have been in a relationship ever since.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Relationships</b></p><p><i>Family</i></p><p>Kuroba Asuka - mother</p><p>Fuuro greatly idolized her mother. She looks up to her for risking her life on a daily basis for the greater good. She aspires to be like her mother and maybe take her place when she gets old. Fuuro tends to praise her to high heaven\u2019s and doesn\u2019t see any flaws that she might have.</p><p>Her mother is naturally very proud of what her daughter manages to achieve by following in her footsteps but silently wishes she\u2019d try and be her own hero instead of imitating her.</p><p>Asuka spends a lot of time with her daughter but despite that their relationship is more like that of a teacher and student rather than mother and daughter which makes Asuka sad. Fuuro on the other hand doesn\u2019t appear to be bothered by the formal and almost distant relationship she has with her mother.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroba Yuuto - father</p><p>Fuuro looks up to her father as well but not to the extreme degree she does with her mother, ultimately making her relationship with him more \u201cfamily-like\u201d.</p><p>Yuuto is aware that Asuka is not happy about her current relationship with Fuuro and tries his best to convince his daughter to treat her mother more like a mother and communicate between the two without telling Fuuro explicitly how her mother feels because he knows Fuuro will think she has disappointed her mother in some way, which would only make the whole ordeal worse.</p><p><br></p><p>Kuroba Souma - younger brother</p><p>Souma doesn\u2019t hold any grudges against his sister for inheriting their mother\u2019s Quirk even though he turned out to be quirkless.</p><p>The two often bicker but mostly about trivial things and they don\u2019t get too insulting, usually.</p><p>Souma has always made an effort to get better grades than Fuuro to show her that even if she has a Quirk and is more physically fit, he is the smarter one. His favourite nickname for Fuuro is \u201cbirdbrain\u201d but he makes sure not to use it when their mother is around since she doesn\u2019t like it when he calls her that. Even though he aspires to be a lawyer he doesn\u2019t mind when he unintentionally (or intentionally) commits a minor misdemeanor. His nonchalant attitude about this and Fuuro\u2019s overbearing law-abidingness are very often the cause of their bickering.</p><p><br></p><p><i>OCs</i></p><p>Hokori Fukasu - friend</p><p>They often hang out at Shinju\u2019s place together, but not so much with just the two of them.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for Shinju the two of them probably would have never met. Fukasu finds Fuuro entertaining and often makes stupid dares with her (nothing that would break any rules though). Fukasu\u2019s carefree attitude reminds Fuuro of her brother, which can be a good and a bad thing. She and Fuuro share a love for sweets</p><p>Fuuro got to know her when doing organisational work with Shinju at her place as Fukasu and her mother live there as well. Fukasu immidiately noticed that Shinju and Fuuro had a thing for each other. Fuuro is very thankful that she convinced her to confess to Shinju. Fukasu now is the designated \u201cthird wheel\u201d whenever they hang out, but she doesn\u2019t mind it.</p><p><br></p><p>Abe Shinju - girlfriend</p><p>They have been together since the end of their first year.<br>The two first started talking to each other when Shinju became the class president and Fuuro the vice class president. Fuuro also befriended a childhood friend of Shinju: Fukasu who attended Shiketsu High and whom she met at times when meeting at Shinju\u2019s place.<br>The two started spending even more time with each other and got to know each other better. Having to organize class events together both of them learned how to rely on each other.<br>Shinju quickly finds herself enarmoured with Fuuro and her ambitious and motivational nature. Fuuro on the other hand falls for her over time, becoming smitten with Shinju\u2019s elegance and the way she carries herself as well as her caring and gentle nature.<br>Fukasu has noticed the two developed feelings for each other and, after watching Fuuro make hearteyes at Shinju day after day, she eventually convinced Fuuro to make a move and the two got together.<br>Fuuro loves Shinju\u2019s smile, her eyes. She often strokes her scales absent-mindedly when they cuddle. Shinju loves being carried around and held by Fuuro. It makes her feel safe and secure. She\u2019d love Fuuro to fly around with her but knows that her girlfriend has limits in her strength so that is only a dream (for now).<br>With Fuuro Shinju feels comfortable enough to talk about personal things, such as her father. Fuuro knows when to let Shinju have her alone time, just as Shinju knows that Fuuro needs her time for her frequent training. Both know they can rely on and trust the other.<br>Shinju may see the value in simple things but she occasionally buys Fuuro expensive gifts, just to impress her girlfriend a little.<br>Since both have an interest for fashion (albeit different styles) they like going shopping together. Fuuro sometimes takes Shinju out to eat at small, local restaurants which Shinju is fascinated by, only being used to either eating at home or going to expensive restaurants.<br>At the end of a day the two also enjoy taking long walks on the beach together, Fuuro watching lovingly as Shinju excitedly collects various seashells.</p><p><b>Trivia</b></p><ul><li>Fuuro is bisexual</li><li>She often trains her Quirk by strapping increasingly heavier weights to herself and flying around for as long as she can</li><li>Her love for punk fashion and intimidating appearance often give her the image of a delinquent when in reality she is a very law-abiding person and chastises even the smallest offense to the law</li><li>In her childhood a lot of socks and shoes ended up ripped and cut due to her very sharp talons so she stopped wearing them all together</li><li>She attacks like an owl, with her feet first</li><li>She has a habit of perching on high places</li><li>She is not a morning person</li><li>She tends to screw up her sleeping schedule by staying up too late</li></ul></p>",

                "content": "<p><p>Reference sheet for my BnHA OC Fuuro Kuroba</p><p>Profile under the cut</p><p><b>\n\nBiographical Information</b><br /><br />Name: Kuroba Fuuro<br />Nickname(s): Fuu, Birdbrain (by her brother)<br />Alias/Hero Name: The Nocturnal Heroine, Night Owl<br /><br /><b>Personal Description</b><br /><br />Birthday: December 12<br />Star Sign: Sagittarius<br />Age: 17/18 years<br />Gender: female<br />Height: 181cm<br />Weight: 77kg<br />Hair colour: Dark grey<br />Eye colour: Purple<br />Skin colour: Tan<br />Quirk: Owl<br />Quirk type: Transformation<br />Quirk range: Short-range<br /><br /><b>Status<br /></b><br />Status: Alive<br />Family:<br /> &nbsp; Kuroba Asuka (mother, alive)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;Kuroba Yuuto (father, alive)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;Kuroba Souma (younger brother, alive)<br />Affiliation: Yuuei Academy<br />Occupation: Student<br />Department: Heroics<br />Class: 2-A<br />Love Interest: Abe Shinju (OC)<br /><br /><b>Appearance</b><br />Fuuro is a tall, muscular girl with relatively broad shoulders. She has short black hair in an undercut and bright purple, upturned eyes. Her legs have a bird-like appearance with scaly skin, very sharp talons and an anisodactyl toe arrangement.<br />Her Yuuei uniform is sleeveless and it can open along the seams on the sides so it doesn&rsquo;t rip when has to activate her Quirk while in uniform.<br /><br /><b>Personality<br /></b><br />Ambitious | Prideful | Sporty | Hardworking | Competitive<br /><br />Fuuro is extremely law-abiding and makes sure to follow rules set by authority at all times. If it isn&rsquo;t about rules then she is fairly reasonable.<br />However she is not above pointless arguments and will often treat a discussion about trivial things too seriously. She tends to overlook any flaws of the people she idolizes greatly, like her mother and tends to be overly formal and reserved around them. Insulting those people greatly enrages her and if someone does so continually she will loose her temper. She won&rsquo;t get violent usually but she can get very vocal when angry. She can see her own actions critically and also that of most other people (if she doesn&rsquo;t happen to idolize them) so she is generally a good choice when you need an objective second opinion.<br />Fuuro very often tells herself that she prefers to work alone since her mother also works alone and she aspires to be like her but she always feels a certain comfort having someone by her side or watch her back. She can generally work well with others and is perfect for organizing teamwork as she has just the right authoritative presence to ensure that everyone is doing their part diligently.<br />She takes pride in her own abilites and accomplishments. Because she is a bit vain when it comes to that, it is very easy to get on her good side with flattery and compliments.<br />For people who don&rsquo;t know her she often appears stoic and unapproachable with a stone-cold, serious expression and she tends to keep that image up around strangers because she wants to appear as someone admirable and authoritative. She only loosens up when around friends or her family. When she is comfortable and doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to appear stern and control her expression, her emotions are very often painfully obvious in her face.<br />She finds it very easy to motivate herself. She enjoys challenging her own limits and regularily does so even if in a controlled manner. She sees stepping out of one&rsquo;s boundaries as a way to improve and exceed yourself.<br />She is ready to face pressure and obstacles in her way to become a hero so she isn&rsquo;t really that affected by pressure. She is determined to finish assigned tasks as quick as possible and works diligently and restlessly on them. She&rsquo;s not a person that regularily slacks off.<br /><br /><i>Likes</i> <br />-Punk fashion<br />-Sweets<br />-Storms<br />-Nighttime<br />-Meat (especially rabbit meat) <br />-Rainy nights<br />-The feeling of blowing wind<br /><br /><i>Dislikes</i><br />-Ghost stories<br />-Rule-breakers<br />-People who don&rsquo;t want to leave their comfort zone <br />-Mornings<br />-The nicknames her brother gives her<br />-Insects<br /><br /><b>Quirk</b><br /><i>Owl Wings</i></p><p>Fuuro&rsquo;s Quirk allows her to transform her arms into owl wings with dark-grey/black feathers. When her Quirk is not active her arms have tiny black feathers protruding from the skin.</p><p><b>Advantage:</b></p><p>+ She can fly for a very long time</p><p>+ Her owl-like wings allow her to fly completely soundless which makes her a great suprise-attacker</p><p>+ Her arm muscles take a very long time to get tired</p><p>+She can easily defend herself against enemies with gas-based Quirks (can blow it away)</p><p>+She is also a good support for allies with a gas-based Quirk (can quickly blow it in the direction of the enemy)</p><p><b>Disadvantage:</b></p><p>- Carrying extra weight exhausts her quickly. She doesn&rsquo;t mind one kilogramm or two. But everything over 5 kg drastically cuts her flying time. If she has to carry another person, she can maybe manage to fly for a couple of minutes before her wings give out.</p><p>- Her bones are lighter and thus more fragile, making her less suited for defense</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Backstory:</b></p><p>Fuuro&rsquo;s mother is a hero herself while her father, who is quirkless, works as a police officer.</p><p>Lawfullness practically ran in her family. She also has a younger brother.</p><p>Her mother Quirk lets her grow black-feathered wings on her back with which she can fly completely soundless and just like Fuuro has bird-like legs, though they are even more bird-like in structure than Fuuro&rsquo;s. Additionally Asuka has feathery hair.</p><p>Fuuro&rsquo;s Quirk manifested on a family trip while they were hiking. She climbed up a very high tree and was just enjoying the scenery when her Quirk manifested and she grew little feathers on her arms and her legs changed into the bird legs she has today. She noticed this and by chance transformed her arms into wings. She was absolutely thrilled, having looked up to her mother all her life and now she inherited her Quirk.</p><p>When her mother called out to her that they wanted to continue the hike, she flew down from the tree. Her mother was overjoyed, as was her father. At the end of the trip Fuuro&rsquo;s hiking shoes were in shambles since her talons cut through them. She felt a bit bad about it, since they were kind of expensive. Afterwards her mother took her under her wing, quite literally.</p><p>Her younger brother remained quirkless and he eventually decided to pursue a career as a lawyer while Fuuro aimed to become a hero like her mother.</p><p>She brought herself in good physical shape by following a strict work-out schedule that her mother occasionally helped her with and studied very hard to get into Yuuei, where her mother had also studied. At Yuuei she entered the class 1-A (a year before the main cast enters the school, she is in 2-A during the story) and made friends amongst her classmates and even one outside the school. Two of them being Fukasu and Shinju. She eventually developed a crush on the latter. After being convinced by Fukasu she confessed to her and the two have been in a relationship ever since.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Relationships</b></p><p><i>Family</i></p><p>Kuroba Asuka - mother</p><p>Fuuro greatly idolized her mother. She looks up to her for risking her life on a daily basis for the greater good. She aspires to be like her mother and maybe take her place when she gets old. Fuuro tends to praise her to high heaven&rsquo;s and doesn&rsquo;t see any flaws that she might have.</p><p>Her mother is naturally very proud of what her daughter manages to achieve by following in her footsteps but silently wishes she&rsquo;d try and be her own hero instead of imitating her.</p><p>Asuka spends a lot of time with her daughter but despite that their relationship is more like that of a teacher and student rather than mother and daughter which makes Asuka sad. Fuuro on the other hand doesn&rsquo;t appear to be bothered by the formal and almost distant relationship she has with her mother.</p><p><br /></p><p>Kuroba Yuuto - father</p><p>Fuuro looks up to her father as well but not to the extreme degree she does with her mother, ultimately making her relationship with him more &ldquo;family-like&rdquo;.</p><p>Yuuto is aware that Asuka is not happy about her current relationship with Fuuro and tries his best to convince his daughter to treat her mother more like a mother and communicate between the two without telling Fuuro explicitly how her mother feels because he knows Fuuro will think she has disappointed her mother in some way, which would only make the whole ordeal worse.</p><p><br /></p><p>Kuroba Souma - younger brother</p><p>Souma doesn&rsquo;t hold any grudges against his sister for inheriting their mother&rsquo;s Quirk even though he turned out to be quirkless.</p><p>The two often bicker but mostly about trivial things and they don&rsquo;t get too insulting, usually.</p><p>Souma has always made an effort to get better grades than Fuuro to show her that even if she has a Quirk and is more physically fit, he is the smarter one. His favourite nickname for Fuuro is &ldquo;birdbrain&rdquo; but he makes sure not to use it when their mother is around since she doesn&rsquo;t like it when he calls her that. Even though he aspires to be a lawyer he doesn&rsquo;t mind when he unintentionally (or intentionally) commits a minor misdemeanor. His nonchalant attitude about this and Fuuro&rsquo;s overbearing law-abidingness are very often the cause of their bickering.</p><p><br /></p><p><i>OCs</i></p><p>Hokori Fukasu - friend</p><p>They often hang out at Shinju&rsquo;s place together, but not so much with just the two of them.</p><p>If it weren&rsquo;t for Shinju the two of them probably would have never met. Fukasu finds Fuuro entertaining and often makes stupid dares with her (nothing that would break any rules though). Fukasu&rsquo;s carefree attitude reminds Fuuro of her brother, which can be a good and a bad thing. She and Fuuro share a love for sweets</p><p>Fuuro got to know her when doing organisational work with Shinju at her place as Fukasu and her mother live there as well. Fukasu immidiately noticed that Shinju and Fuuro had a thing for each other. Fuuro is very thankful that she convinced her to confess to Shinju. Fukasu now is the designated &ldquo;third wheel&rdquo; whenever they hang out, but she doesn&rsquo;t mind it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Abe Shinju - girlfriend</p><p>They have been together since the end of their first year.<br />The two first started talking to each other when Shinju became the class president and Fuuro the vice class president. Fuuro also befriended a childhood friend of Shinju: Fukasu who attended Shiketsu High and whom she met at times when meeting at Shinju&rsquo;s place.<br />The two started spending even more time with each other and got to know each other better. Having to organize class events together both of them learned how to rely on each other.<br />Shinju quickly finds herself enarmoured with Fuuro and her ambitious and motivational nature. Fuuro on the other hand falls for her over time, becoming smitten with Shinju&rsquo;s elegance and the way she carries herself as well as her caring and gentle nature.<br />Fukasu has noticed the two developed feelings for each other and, after watching Fuuro make hearteyes at Shinju day after day, she eventually convinced Fuuro to make a move and the two got together.<br />Fuuro loves Shinju&rsquo;s smile, her eyes. She often strokes her scales absent-mindedly when they cuddle. Shinju loves being carried around and held by Fuuro. It makes her feel safe and secure. She&rsquo;d love Fuuro to fly around with her but knows that her girlfriend has limits in her strength so that is only a dream (for now).<br />With Fuuro Shinju feels comfortable enough to talk about personal things, such as her father. Fuuro knows when to let Shinju have her alone time, just as Shinju knows that Fuuro needs her time for her frequent training. Both know they can rely on and trust the other.<br />Shinju may see the value in simple things but she occasionally buys Fuuro expensive gifts, just to impress her girlfriend a little.<br />Since both have an interest for fashion (albeit different styles) they like going shopping together. Fuuro sometimes takes Shinju out to eat at small, local restaurants which Shinju is fascinated by, only being used to either eating at home or going to expensive restaurants.<br />At the end of a day the two also enjoy taking long walks on the beach together, Fuuro watching lovingly as Shinju excitedly collects various seashells.</p><p><b>Trivia</b></p><ul><li>Fuuro is bisexual</li><li>She often trains her Quirk by strapping increasingly heavier weights to herself and flying around for as long as she can</li><li>Her love for punk fashion and intimidating appearance often give her the image of a delinquent when in reality she is a very law-abiding person and chastises even the smallest offense to the law</li><li>In her childhood a lot of socks and shoes ended up ripped and cut due to her very sharp talons so she stopped wearing them all together</li><li>She attacks like an owl, with her feet first</li><li>She has a habit of perching on high places</li><li>She is not a morning person</li><li>She tends to screw up her sleeping schedule by staying up too late</li></ul></p>",

Her height is slightly above average.<br/>She has long, straight, light turquoise hair that falls to the middle of her back. Two bangs fall over her shoulders adorned by white ribbons that wrap around the bangs like tubes.<br/>She has patches of silver, glistening scales on her body and gentle, narrow eyes with long lashes. Her eyes appear to be completely dark blue with no visible scalera.<br/>She wears the standard Yuuei Uniform.<br/><br/><b>Personality</b><br/><br/>Reserved | Polite | Motherly | Logical | Adaptable<br/><br/>Shinju is quiet, reserved and independent. She pefers a few close friends over a wide group of people she barely knows and sometimes just needs some time alone.<br/>If pushed too far she can have emotional outbursts. Other than those time she generally keeps her emotions to herself and does not share things about herself very often. That she only does when she trusts a person and has a deep bond with them. Despite coming from a wealthy family she is very humble and sees value in the simple things.<br/>Shinju speaks in a polite manner, being able to word even criticism in such a gentle way that people don&rsquo;t realize they were just criticized. She has an incredibly gentle and calming demeanor and seems unfathomable. Her kind and understanding nature makes her good at calming people down and reassuring those who are unsure or doubting themselves. She&rsquo;ll patiently listen to someone&rsquo;s problems and offer help. Any secret is safe with her.<br/>She often feels like she has to take care of everything which often ends up with her taking control over everything and mothering people who don&rsquo;t want it.<br/>She&rsquo;s a logical thinker and loves learning and expanding her horizon. Being able to adapt to new situations fast, she can make quick and effective decisions even when faced with an unexpected event.<br/>She will treat anyone she meets with respect unless they prove to her that they do not deserve her respect. Once you have lost it, her respect will be very hard to earn back.<br/>People who lost her respect will be treated coldly or ignored at given situations.<br/><br/><i> Likes</i> <br/>-Gemstones<br/>-Swimming<br/>-Music<br/>-Fashion<br/>-Collecting seashells<br/>-Sushi<br/>-Fireworks<br/><br/><i> Dislikes</i> <br/>-Gaudy fashion<br/>-People who are rude for fun<br/>-Chlorinated water<br/>-Onions<br/><br/><b>Quirk</b><br/><i>Bubble</i></p><p><i><br/></i>Her Quirk gives her the ability to form bubbles out of her own spit. She can make bubbles of varying sizes, from teeny tiny to big enough to contain a person. Additionally only she can pop them.<br/>She can make three kinds of bubbles:<br/>1) Impassable ones that no one can pass through, not even her! They are perfect for being used as protection against attacks<br/>2) One-time-passable ones through which a person can pass only once and then the bubble becomes impassable.

He only ever appeared disguised and using his transformation-type Quirk so his &ldquo;real&rdquo; appearance was unknown.<br/>He planned to break members of his old villain group out of prison when he noticed that he struggled more and more against heroes and feared that if he kept fighting alone he might be imprisoned too.<br/>He wanted to try and get closer to one of the influential families that maintained the high-security villain prisons to find out more about the prison and formulate a proper plan to break them out. Eventually he managed to insert himself into one of the families by starting a relationship with Shinju&rsquo;s mother, Manami Abe, through whom he hoped to get his hands on information about the prison.<br/>But the results did not come as fast as he wanted. His impatience and frustration started to seep in his relationship and it turned abusive.<br/>Because of his previous very careful and considerate beheaviour Shinju&rsquo;s mother continually excused and denied his abuse and thought that it&rsquo;d stop it eventually.<br/>Shinju&rsquo;s father grew worried that his frustration and the resulting abuse might disturb his plans, if Manami chose to break up with him. So he came up with the idea to &ldquo;secure&rdquo; his relationship with Shinju&rsquo;s mother by having a child together. Since Shinju&rsquo;s mother also had a Quirk he hoped the child would inherit one of their Quirks or maybe even both and he could groom them to become a successor of sorts.<br/>Shortly after Shinju was born, her father put his plan to break his group out of prison in motion. He succeeded but his success was short-lived. A group of heroes quickly took up pursuit and eventually caught him, though not all members of his villain group were caught again. Shinju, who was taken by her father after the prisonbreak, was brought back to her mother.<br/>Manami, even though deeply hurt by Katashi, continued to take care of Shinju as her daughter. She recieved support from her family and was guarded by a personal hero in case one of the members of Katashi&rsquo;s villain group would show up. Manami later employed the guard permanently (on her father&rsquo;s wish).<br/>Shinju was lucky not to have inherited many traits from her father, which is one of the main reasons her mother could bear to raise her. The only thing reminiscient of his genes being the patches of silvery scales on Shinju&rsquo;s body. Her Quirk, too, ended up being that of her mother, which she could not be happier about as she feared that being more like him would cause her mother to hate her. She despises her father after being old enough to be told and understand what happened.<br/>She always tried to &ldquo;take care&rdquo; of her mother from a very young age, taking many responsibilites of off her so she doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about it. There was no personnel around for quite some times because Shinju&rsquo;s mother was afraid of having anyone outside of the direct family into the house, so Shinju took up the household chores and even learned how to cook very early. Even when her mother employed personnel again, she continued doing some of the chores.<br/>Shinju, being homeschooled, did not have that much interaction with people outside of her family and the housestaff. Her only &ldquo;friend&rdquo; was Fukasu, the child of the personal body guard hero who lived at their house.<br/>Shinju eventually decided to pursue a career as a hero to distance herself from her father as much as possible and also to appeal to her mother, signalizing to her that she will never become like her father.<br/>Once accepted into Yuuei she was assigned to class 1-A. Unfortunately for her her friend Fukasu, who also tried to get into Yuuei, failed the Entrance Exam.<br/><br/><b>Relationships</b><br/><br/><i>Family:</i><br/><br/>Abe Manami - mother<br/>Shinju&rsquo;s relationship with her mother is complicated. While both love each other there is an underlying, barely there but still existing fear on both sides. Shinju fears her mother&rsquo;s rejection and being grouped with her father while Manami fears Shinju making a 180\u00b0 turn and becoming just like Katashi. Both of them also violently try to reject that fear but it&rsquo;s still there.<br/>Shinju sees her mother as an incredibly strong person who could continue on living through such a devastating relationship. She tries her best to appeal to her mother and make her feel safe. Manami sees her daughter as the one &ldquo;good thing that came out of her relationship with Katashi.<br/><br/>Hamasaki Katashi - father<br/>Katashi knows next to nothing about Shinju and has not seen her after the heroes captured him. Shinju harbours nothing but resentment towards her father. She knows that he is in prison but has never and most likely will never go and see him. She is afraid to.<br/><br/><i>OCs:</i><br/><br/>Hokori Fukasu - childhood friend<br/>The child of Manami&rsquo;s personal body guard and Shinju&rsquo;s first real friend. They spent a lot of time together in their childhoods and still do today. When Shinju first started thinking about pursuing a career as a hero Fukasu was immidiately on board too. The two started to spend some of their time training their Quirks to prepare for the entrance exam.<br/>She was the one who got Shinju and Fuuro together.<br/><br/>Kuroba F\u016bro - girlfriend<br/>They have been together since the end of their first year.<br/>The two first started talking to each other when Shinju became the class president and F\u016bro the vice class president. F\u016bro also befriended a childhood friend of Shinju: Fukasu who attended Shiketsu High and whom she met at times when meeting at Shinju&rsquo;s place.<br/>The two started spending even more time with each other and got to know each other better. Having to organize class events together both of them learned how to rely on each other.<br/>Shinju quickly finds herself enarmoured with F\u016bro and her ambitious and motivational nature.<br/>F\u016bro on the other hand falls for her over time, becoming smitten with Shinju&rsquo;s elegance and the way she carries herself as well as her caring and gentle nature.<br/>Fukasu has noticed the two developed feelings for each other and, after watching F\u016bro make hearteyes at Shinju day after day, she eventually convinced F\u016bro to make a move and the two got together.<br/><br/>F\u016bro loves Shinju&rsquo;s smile, her eyes. She often strokes her scales absent-mindedly when they cuddle. Shinju loves being carried around and held by F\u016bro. It makes her feel safe and secure. She&rsquo;d love F\u016bro to fly around with her but knows that her girlfriend has limits in her strength so that is only a dream (for now).<br/>With F\u016bro Shinju feels comfortable enough to talk about personal things, such as her father.<br/>F\u016bro knows when to let Shinju have her alone time, just as Shinju knows that F\u016bro needs her time for her frequent training. Both know they can rely on and trust the other.<br/>Shinju may see the value in simple things but she occasionally buys F\u016bro expensive gifts, just to impress her girlfriend a little.<br/>Since both have an interest for fashion (albeit different styles) they like going shopping together. F\u016bro sometimes takes Shinju out to eat at small, local restaurants which Shinju is fascinated by, only being used to either eating at home or going to expensive restaurants.<br/>At the end of a day the two also enjoy taking long walks on the beach together, F\u016bro watching lovingly as Shinju excitedly collects various seashells.<br/><br/><b>Trivia:</b><br/>-She&rsquo;s a lesbian<br/>-Her saliva smells kinda soap-y<br/>-The feeling of water on her skin is very soothing for her<br/>-She plays the violin to release frustration, the pieces she plays always end up sounding chaotic and energetic as a result<br/></p>",

Eventually he managed to insert himself into one of the families by starting a relationship with Shinju\u2019s mother, Manami Abe, through whom he hoped to get his hands on information about the prison.<br>But the results did not come as fast as he wanted. His impatience and frustration started to seep in his relationship and it turned abusive.<br>Because of his previous very careful and considerate beheaviour Shinju\u2019s mother continually excused and denied his abuse and thought that it\u2019d stop it eventually.<br>Shinju\u2019s father grew worried that his frustration and the resulting abuse might disturb his plans, if Manami chose to break up with him. So he came up with the idea to \u201csecure\u201d his relationship with Shinju\u2019s mother by having a child together. Since Shinju\u2019s mother also had a Quirk he hoped the child would inherit one of their Quirks or maybe even both and he could groom them to become a successor of sorts.<br>Shortly after Shinju was born, her father put his plan to break his group out of prison in motion. He succeeded but his success was short-lived. A group of heroes quickly took up pursuit and eventually caught him, though not all members of his villain group were caught again. Shinju, who was taken by her father after the prisonbreak, was brought back to her mother.<br>Manami, even though deeply hurt by Katashi, continued to take care of Shinju as her daughter. She recieved support from her family and was guarded by a personal hero in case one of the members of Katashi\u2019s villain group would show up. Manami later employed the guard permanently (on her father\u2019s wish).<br>Shinju was lucky not to have inherited many traits from her father, which is one of the main reasons her mother could bear to raise her. The only thing reminiscient of his genes being the patches of silvery scales on Shinju\u2019s body. Her Quirk, too, ended up being that of her mother, which she could not be happier about as she feared that being more like him would cause her mother to hate her. She despises her father after being old enough to be told and understand what happened.<br>She always tried to \u201ctake care\u201d of her mother from a very young age, taking many responsibilites of off her so she doesn\u2019t have to worry about it. There was no personnel around for quite some times because Shinju\u2019s mother was afraid of having anyone outside of the direct family into the house, so Shinju took up the household chores and even learned how to cook very early. Even when her mother employed personnel again, she continued doing some of the chores.<br>Shinju, being homeschooled, did not have that much interaction with people outside of her family and the housestaff. Her only \u201cfriend\u201d was Fukasu, the child of the personal body guard hero who lived at their house.<br>Shinju eventually decided to pursue a career as a hero to distance herself from her father as much as possible and also to appeal to her mother, signalizing to her that she will never become like her father.<br>Once accepted into Yuuei she was assigned to class 1-A. Unfortunately for her her friend Fukasu, who also tried to get into Yuuei, failed the Entrance Exam.<br><br><b>Relationships</b><br><br><i>Family:</i><br><br>Abe Manami - mother<br>Shinju\u2019s relationship with her mother is complicated. While both love each other there is an underlying, barely there but still existing fear on both sides. Shinju fears her mother\u2019s rejection and being grouped with her father while Manami fears Shinju making a 180\u00b0 turn and becoming just like Katashi. Both of them also violently try to reject that fear but it\u2019s still there.<br>Shinju sees her mother as an incredibly strong person who could continue on living through such a devastating relationship.

Her height is slightly above average.<br />She has long, straight, light turquoise hair that falls to the middle of her back. Two bangs fall over her shoulders adorned by white ribbons that wrap around the bangs like tubes.<br />She has patches of silver, glistening scales on her body and gentle, narrow eyes with long lashes. Her eyes appear to be completely dark blue with no visible scalera.<br />She wears the standard Yuuei Uniform.<br /><br /><b>Personality</b><br /><br />Reserved | Polite | Motherly | Logical | Adaptable<br /><br />Shinju is quiet, reserved and independent. She pefers a few close friends over a wide group of people she barely knows and sometimes just needs some time alone.<br />If pushed too far she can have emotional outbursts. Other than those time she generally keeps her emotions to herself and does not share things about herself very often. That she only does when she trusts a person and has a deep bond with them. Despite coming from a wealthy family she is very humble and sees value in the simple things.<br />Shinju speaks in a polite manner, being able to word even criticism in such a gentle way that people don&rsquo;t realize they were just criticized. She has an incredibly gentle and calming demeanor and seems unfathomable. Her kind and understanding nature makes her good at calming people down and reassuring those who are unsure or doubting themselves. She&rsquo;ll patiently listen to someone&rsquo;s problems and offer help. Any secret is safe with her.<br />She often feels like she has to take care of everything which often ends up with her taking control over everything and mothering people who don&rsquo;t want it.<br />She&rsquo;s a logical thinker and loves learning and expanding her horizon. Being able to adapt to new situations fast, she can make quick and effective decisions even when faced with an unexpected event.<br />She will treat anyone she meets with respect unless they prove to her that they do not deserve her respect. Once you have lost it, her respect will be very hard to earn back.<br />People who lost her respect will be treated coldly or ignored at given situations.<br /><br /><i> Likes</i> <br />-Gemstones<br />-Swimming<br />-Music<br />-Fashion<br />-Collecting seashells<br />-Sushi<br />-Fireworks<br /><br /><i> Dislikes</i> <br />-Gaudy fashion<br />-People who are rude for fun<br />-Chlorinated water<br />-Onions<br /><br /><b>Quirk</b><br /><i>Bubble</i></p><p><i><br /></i>Her Quirk gives her the ability to form bubbles out of her own spit. She can make bubbles of varying sizes, from teeny tiny to big enough to contain a person.

They are perfect for being used as protection against attacks<br />2) One-time-passable ones through which a person can pass only once and then the bubble becomes impassable. Perfect for protecting civilians and allies or imprisoning villains.<br />3)Passable ones that anyone can pass through (but not pop). These are mainly used to confuse opponents.<br /><br /><b>Advantage:</b><br />+ The first 2 kinds of bubbles are perfect for protecting<br />+ There are no visible differences between the 3 kinds of bubbles so her opponent has to guess which kind it is<br /><br /><b>Disadvantage:</b><br />- She has to decide before making a bubble what kind she wants to make, once she started she can not change the kind of bubble<br />- If she has not decided before making the bubble it will act just like a completely normal bubble (meaning it can be popped by the smallest contact)<br />- Making very big bubbles takes time and the process can be disturbed when she has to cough<br />- Depending on how big she makes them, she can only make a certain amount<br />- They pop on their own when enough time has passed or when Shinju is knocked out.<br /><br /><b>Backstory:</b><br />Shinju&rsquo;s father Katashi was a villain.
