I want to spend my life with you. </i></p><p>These sentences have fallen out of both of your lips, cheesy sayings that somehow felt special to both of you. Words that have been repeated over and over, but it sounds like the first time you\u2019ve ever heard them. It sends your heart tumbling down and your mind racing whenever they spill out of Peter lips and he can say the same. Butterflies would take flight and you were the embodiment of heart eyes whenever you look at him, hell, even when you think about him. Peter would practically fall to his knees at the mention of your name. You were both so whipped. Yet, there were three little words that have been echoed throughout the entirety of the world, but haven\u2019t left yours or Peters lips.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>There were moments where it feels like what you have with Peter was love at the start. It was a terrifying thing to admit that he stole your heart, but as time went on, there was no doubt in your mind that you didn\u2019t love him. It was his stupid jokes and horrible puns. It was the way his eyes sparked up when he was filled with happiness that it outshone New York at night. It was the way he was always there for you when you needed him or when you didn\u2019t. He was this angel of a boyfriend that it would be impossible to not fall in love with him. You were barely holding it together, he somehow made everything better that you had to tell him. He just had to know that he was epitome of sunshine and how hard you fell for him.</p><p>Then it would hit you out of nowhere. The fear that it wouldn\u2019t be reciprocated and that it would scare him off to be with someone else. The sole idea of pushing Peter away was terrifying, there was no way you could let him go easily. He was everything to you. So, your love was silenced but god, your heart could burst at the thought of him. Love songs on the radio made sense and you could understand why people would do crazy things for love. It was this rush, an addicting rush, that made you want to dance around like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Love was a drug, as cheesy as it is. You were addicted to him, you needed him to be with you like you need oxygen. Though you were sure about your feelings, you just wanted to wait for Peter to say the words first. It just made sense.</p><p>Peter bit his lips, his eyebrows scrunched as he stared down the TV. He glanced over at you, just long enough for him to not notice the green shell headed his way. By the time his concentration is back on the screen, he was knocked down into sixth place and he was forced to watch some characters whizz by. He groaned in frustration, as Yoshi started to roll back up. \u201cWhat the heck? This isn\u2019t even fair.\u201d</p><p>You violently jerked your remote to the left, avoiding the corner of the castle. You let out a small laugh as Peter struggled to battle his way back up during the last lap. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? What place are you in?\u201d Peter says, a slight offended tone weaved through his question.</p><p>\u201cFirst place,\u201d You said with a smirk playing on your lips. Luigi never failed you once.</p><p>Peter sticked his elbow out, hitting you hand to the side. Your eyes widen as you go astray, heading straight into the grass that no one ever wanted to be. A gasp that could be heard throughout the city left your lips. \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked innocently, pretending as if he hadn\u2019t done the ultimate act of war.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just do that,\u201d you exclaimed. Your heart drop with your place. Anger was brewing deep within you, this wasn\u2019t just a game. Your pride was on the line and there was no way you would let it go. You quickly attempted to recover your throne, passing Peach but Walugi is putting up a good fight. </p><p>\u201cThis game is brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see why Ned dosen\u2019t play Mario Kart with you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he just acts like a sore loser when he loses. This isn\u2019t about me, plus you\u2019re doing fine,\u201d Peter said rolling his eyes.</p><p>You brushed off the comment and get hypnotized by the game unfolding. You push past Walugi, putting you back on your rightful throne. The finish line was so close, behind the bend was the checkered painted ground that would make you victorious. Victory would taste so sweet. But you didn\u2019t see it coming. You didn\u2019t see Peter gaining the yellow star that would transform him into a holographic mess. How the flashing, color-changing Yoshi had crept up on you. Victory flashed before your eyes, but then all of sudden, Luigi rolls around and Yoshi passed by with a Peter screaming with pride. Cars rushed past, making you fifth place in the scheme of things.</p><p>\u201cI won! I won!\u201d Peter shouted. He launched off the couch, throwing his hands up in the air. He spun around to face you, with the biggest smile plastered on his face. However your face was flat, no emotions shown and your mouth agape that your crown was stolen from right below you. Peter sucked in a breath, judging from the hostile look behind your eyes, you were not here for this. \u201cAre you, um, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter lowered his arms, fear ran up his spine. The next thing he knows, he\u2019s crouching in front of you, his eye level matching yours. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he spitted out, the panic so clear.</p><p>A smile spread from the corner of your mouth before growing into this uncontrollable laughter at Peters reaction. There was no way you could get your blood boiling at him, especially for this. Yes, you were pissed, but Peter was Peter. Laughter carried through the air, infecting Peter. He\u2019s gasping for air, shaking his head with you. He reached out for your arm, using you for support as he tried to fight it off. God, he was adorable.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d Peter said between his gasps for air.</p><p>Your eyes crinkled at the corner, as you watched Peter settle back down. Your mouth was moving before you knew what you were saying. \u201cNo, you\u2019re lucky that I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Peter said without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cAnother round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, maybe we could order pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah of course, but can we order fr-\u201c Your voice trailed off, the reality of the conversation setting in. That was it. Three little words let out in the open to run wild and free now. Three littles words that made your heart stop mid-beat and blossomed a whole entire garden within you.</p><p>Peters cheeks tint with the lightest pink, his eyes trained on the ground. His heart pounds against his chest, but it mustn\u2019t be mistaken for fear. It was the type that could only come from pure bliss. The type that makes butterflies come alive and makes life feel too good to be real.</p><p>The air disappears from the room, both of you holding a breath. Hearts were soaring and shy glances were shared. It was a reminiscent of the first date in a way. There was nervous laughter and shy brushes of your hand during the date, but the same exact feeling was replicated. The same beautiful, thrilling feeling. The unsurety of what happens next, but the mutual knowledge that this was going to grow into something bigger.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t your ideal plan. You were certainly not planning to say it first, let alone say it after a round of Mario Kart, but somehow it was a relief. To know that you were on the same page as Peter lifted a weight of your shoulder. Of course, there was the shadow of doubt that this was all a figment of imagination. That you pretended he said that because that\u2019s what you expected to hear or that it was just an automatic response that he didn\u2019t mean. You broke the sweet silence with a gentle whisper, that said \u201cYou do?\u201d. </p><p>Peter bit his lip, he does. He knows he does. He loves the way you play with his hair and the light kisses you leave on his cheek. He could get lost in your laughter and he just wanted to make you laugh forever, just to hear it. He adores the way you naturally lean on him and how you feel so right in his arms. He likes how he can talk to you for hours with no end and you never get bored, even if it\u2019s him discussing Star Wars for the hundredth time. What he loves the most is the way you make him feel. All of his armor falls and he\u2019s just him. He was enough with you, he didn\u2019t have to think twice about anything, everything was just so right. At the same time, he was always at the edge of his seat. Being with you made him feel like he was truly living, it was a rush of adrenaline everyday. Somehow, you were a safe haven and a spontaneous adventure at the same time.</p><p>Of course, people would pass this off as stupid teenager love. It was just the honeymoon phase before everything crumbled down. The thing was, Peter wants it all. He wants the bad days when you\u2019re crying a river. He wants the sick days where you haven\u2019t seen sunlight in days. He wants the rough days where you\u2019re going insane from exams and can\u2019t deal with anything. He wants the days where everyone and everything annoys you. He wants it all.</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t recognize it directly, the feeling of love, but he certainly felt it. There was no other explanation it. He wants you when you\u2019re all put together but he also wants you at three a.m., sleep deprived and unconherient. He wants to see your thrive but catch you when you stumble. He wants the good and bad. He didn\u2019t understand it, but at the same time he did. He said it so easily, that he had to know somewhere, and now he knows what this feeling was. It was love. </p><p>So when you ask that question, your focus down and heat rising to you cheeks, he knows the answer. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>When you looked up to make eye contact with Peter who was still crouching down, your heart fluttered as his response. \u201cYeah?\u201d you asked with a small smile growing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, still breathless at the discovery. </p><p>You\u2019re full out beaming at Peter, his heart could burst at the sight. You were out of this world, you must be in heaven because this is too good to be true. Your cheeks hurt from the straining smile, but it didn\u2019t matter. <i>He loves you</i>. Your hands flew out to his face, as you pull him closer til your lips connected. Your hands moved from his face to wrapping around his neck. He kissed so soft, that it makes you feel like it was the first time. When you pull away, you closed your eyes as you rested your forehead against his. \u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered, your voice cracking. It was still a new sentence that you weren\u2019t used to saying, but that would change. You know it.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, his hands on your waist. He closed his eyes with yours, his heartbeat syncing with yours.</p><p>The familiar smile that hadn\u2019t left your face gets stronger if that\u2019s possible. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>A small giggle left your lips. It was like you were seven when you would exchange crushes and burst into giggly laughter. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>You threw your head back, the giggle transforming into laughter. \u201cI love you, I love you, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Peter joined into the bubbling joy that was bursting from your lips, god, he loved this. He loves you. \u201cI love you, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, we\u2019re going to become that couple,\u201d You said through broken laughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gonna be disgusted with us.\u201d You shook your head, but that stupid smile was still there.</p><p>Peter finally stood, arching his back in a stretch. He held his hands out for you to place your own in his, as he pulled you up. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I could dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the background noise of Mario Kart?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. The most romantic sound ever,\u201d Peter said, wiggling his eyebrows in a mockingly seductive way.</p><p>Peter begins to swing your conjoined hands between you. \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re such a nerd.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA nerd that you love.\u201d He said with a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cYou got me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always got you,\u201d he joked. He lets go of one of your hands to spin you right into his arms. His arms snaked around you, holding you close.</p><p>Whatever he did always made that smile never leave. \u201cWe\u2019re so cliche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d</p><p>Tagging some mutuals who may like my shitty writing: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHroWymxnoTn-S5YHqCtLNg\">@theamazingspiderlingg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT-x-MTiMyRqYIFlH3Tqb4g\">@princeofsassgard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_6FniXy7X-mooNbpp8r2w\">@dudewherearethepeaches</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYFEnb_SCeZM747t7uJ-rMQ\">@hollandsosterfield</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjSytOf70Vuk-IW_uSRR7rA\">@vnderoos</a> </p>",

You broke the sweet silence with a gentle whisper, that said \u201cYou do?\u201d. </p><p>Peter bit his lip, he does. He knows he does. He loves the way you play with his hair and the light kisses you leave on his cheek. He could get lost in your laughter and he just wanted to make you laugh forever, just to hear it. He adores the way you naturally lean on him and how you feel so right in his arms. He likes how he can talk to you for hours with no end and you never get bored, even if it\u2019s him discussing Star Wars for the hundredth time. What he loves the most is the way you make him feel. All of his armor falls and he\u2019s just him. He was enough with you, he didn\u2019t have to think twice about anything, everything was just so right. At the same time, he was always at the edge of his seat. Being with you made him feel like he was truly living, it was a rush of adrenaline everyday. Somehow, you were a safe haven and a spontaneous adventure at the same time.</p><p>Of course, people would pass this off as stupid teenager love. It was just the honeymoon phase before everything crumbled down. The thing was, Peter wants it all. He wants the bad days when you\u2019re crying a river. He wants the sick days where you haven\u2019t seen sunlight in days. He wants the rough days where you\u2019re going insane from exams and can\u2019t deal with anything. He wants the days where everyone and everything annoys you. He wants it all.</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t recognize it directly, the feeling of love, but he certainly felt it. There was no other explanation it. He wants you when you\u2019re all put together but he also wants you at three a.m., sleep deprived and unconherient. He wants to see your thrive but catch you when you stumble. He wants the good and bad. He didn\u2019t understand it, but at the same time he did. He said it so easily, that he had to know somewhere, and now he knows what this feeling was. It was love. </p><p>So when you ask that question, your focus down and heat rising to you cheeks, he knows the answer. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>When you looked up to make eye contact with Peter who was still crouching down, your heart fluttered as his response. \u201cYeah?\u201d you asked with a small smile growing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, still breathless at the discovery. </p><p>You\u2019re full out beaming at Peter, his heart could burst at the sight. You were out of this world, you must be in heaven because this is too good to be true. Your cheeks hurt from the straining smile, but it didn\u2019t matter. <i>He loves you</i>. Your hands flew out to his face, as you pull him closer til your lips connected. Your hands moved from his face to wrapping around his neck. He kissed so soft, that it makes you feel like it was the first time. When you pull away, you closed your eyes as you rested your forehead against his. \u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered, your voice cracking. It was still a new sentence that you weren\u2019t used to saying, but that would change. You know it.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, his hands on your waist. He closed his eyes with yours, his heartbeat syncing with yours.</p><p>The familiar smile that hadn\u2019t left your face gets stronger if that\u2019s possible. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>A small giggle left your lips. It was like you were seven when you would exchange crushes and burst into giggly laughter. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>You threw your head back, the giggle transforming into laughter. \u201cI love you, I love you, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Peter joined into the bubbling joy that was bursting from your lips, god, he loved this. He loves you. \u201cI love you, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, we\u2019re going to become that couple,\u201d You said through broken laughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gonna be disgusted with us.\u201d You shook your head, but that stupid smile was still there.</p><p>Peter finally stood, arching his back in a stretch. He held his hands out for you to place your own in his, as he pulled you up. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I could dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the background noise of Mario Kart?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. The most romantic sound ever,\u201d Peter said, wiggling his eyebrows in a mockingly seductive way.</p><p>Peter begins to swing your conjoined hands between you. \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re such a nerd.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA nerd that you love.\u201d He said with a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cYou got me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always got you,\u201d he joked. He lets go of one of your hands to spin you right into his arms. His arms snaked around you, holding you close.</p><p>Whatever he did always made that smile never leave. \u201cWe\u2019re so cliche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d</p><p>Tagging some mutuals who may like my shitty writing: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHroWymxnoTn-S5YHqCtLNg\">@theamazingspiderlingg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT-x-MTiMyRqYIFlH3Tqb4g\">@princeofsassgard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_6FniXy7X-mooNbpp8r2w\">@dudewherearethepeaches</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYFEnb_SCeZM747t7uJ-rMQ\">@hollandsosterfield</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjSytOf70Vuk-IW_uSRR7rA\">@vnderoos</a> </p></p>",

Words that have been repeated over and over, but it sounds like the first time you\u2019ve ever heard them. It sends your heart tumbling down and your mind racing whenever they spill out of Peter lips and he can say the same. Butterflies would take flight and you were the embodiment of heart eyes whenever you look at him, hell, even when you think about him. Peter would practically fall to his knees at the mention of your name. You were both so whipped. Yet, there were three little words that have been echoed throughout the entirety of the world, but haven\u2019t left yours or Peters lips.</p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>There were moments where it feels like what you have with Peter was love at the start. It was a terrifying thing to admit that he stole your heart, but as time went on, there was no doubt in your mind that you didn\u2019t love him. It was his stupid jokes and horrible puns. It was the way his eyes sparked up when he was filled with happiness that it outshone New York at night. It was the way he was always there for you when you needed him or when you didn\u2019t. He was this angel of a boyfriend that it would be impossible to not fall in love with him. You were barely holding it together, he somehow made everything better that you had to tell him. He just had to know that he was epitome of sunshine and how hard you fell for him.</p><p>Then it would hit you out of nowhere. The fear that it wouldn\u2019t be reciprocated and that it would scare him off to be with someone else. The sole idea of pushing Peter away was terrifying, there was no way you could let him go easily. He was everything to you. So, your love was silenced but god, your heart could burst at the thought of him. Love songs on the radio made sense and you could understand why people would do crazy things for love. It was this rush, an addicting rush, that made you want to dance around like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Love was a drug, as cheesy as it is. You were addicted to him, you needed him to be with you like you need oxygen. Though you were sure about your feelings, you just wanted to wait for Peter to say the words first. It just made sense.</p><p>Peter bit his lips, his eyebrows scrunched as he stared down the TV. He glanced over at you, just long enough for him to not notice the green shell headed his way. By the time his concentration is back on the screen, he was knocked down into sixth place and he was forced to watch some characters whizz by. He groaned in frustration, as Yoshi started to roll back up. \u201cWhat the heck? This isn\u2019t even fair.\u201d</p><p>You violently jerked your remote to the left, avoiding the corner of the castle. You let out a small laugh as Peter struggled to battle his way back up during the last lap. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? What place are you in?\u201d Peter says, a slight offended tone weaved through his question.</p><p>\u201cFirst place,\u201d You said with a smirk playing on your lips. Luigi never failed you once.</p><p>Peter sticked his elbow out, hitting you hand to the side. Your eyes widen as you go astray, heading straight into the grass that no one ever wanted to be. A gasp that could be heard throughout the city left your lips. \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked innocently, pretending as if he hadn\u2019t done the ultimate act of war.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just do that,\u201d you exclaimed. Your heart drop with your place. Anger was brewing deep within you, this wasn\u2019t just a game. Your pride was on the line and there was no way you would let it go. You quickly attempted to recover your throne, passing Peach but Walugi is putting up a good fight. </p><p>\u201cThis game is brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see why Ned dosen\u2019t play Mario Kart with you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he just acts like a sore loser when he loses. This isn\u2019t about me, plus you\u2019re doing fine,\u201d Peter said rolling his eyes.</p><p>You brushed off the comment and get hypnotized by the game unfolding. You push past Walugi, putting you back on your rightful throne. The finish line was so close, behind the bend was the checkered painted ground that would make you victorious. Victory would taste so sweet. But you didn\u2019t see it coming. You didn\u2019t see Peter gaining the yellow star that would transform him into a holographic mess. How the flashing, color-changing Yoshi had crept up on you. Victory flashed before your eyes, but then all of sudden, Luigi rolls around and Yoshi passed by with a Peter screaming with pride. Cars rushed past, making you fifth place in the scheme of things.</p><p>\u201cI won! I won!\u201d Peter shouted. He launched off the couch, throwing his hands up in the air. He spun around to face you, with the biggest smile plastered on his face. However your face was flat, no emotions shown and your mouth agape that your crown was stolen from right below you. Peter sucked in a breath, judging from the hostile look behind your eyes, you were not here for this. \u201cAre you, um, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter lowered his arms, fear ran up his spine. The next thing he knows, he\u2019s crouching in front of you, his eye level matching yours. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he spitted out, the panic so clear.</p><p>A smile spread from the corner of your mouth before growing into this uncontrollable laughter at Peters reaction. There was no way you could get your blood boiling at him, especially for this. Yes, you were pissed, but Peter was Peter. Laughter carried through the air, infecting Peter. He\u2019s gasping for air, shaking his head with you. He reached out for your arm, using you for support as he tried to fight it off. God, he was adorable.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d Peter said between his gasps for air.</p><p>Your eyes crinkled at the corner, as you watched Peter settle back down. Your mouth was moving before you knew what you were saying. \u201cNo, you\u2019re lucky that I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Peter said without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cAnother round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, maybe we could order pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah of course, but can we order fr-\u201c Your voice trailed off, the reality of the conversation setting in. That was it. Three little words let out in the open to run wild and free now. Three littles words that made your heart stop mid-beat and blossomed a whole entire garden within you.</p><p>Peters cheeks tint with the lightest pink, his eyes trained on the ground. His heart pounds against his chest, but it mustn\u2019t be mistaken for fear. It was the type that could only come from pure bliss. The type that makes butterflies come alive and makes life feel too good to be real.</p><p>The air disappears from the room, both of you holding a breath. Hearts were soaring and shy glances were shared. It was a reminiscent of the first date in a way. There was nervous laughter and shy brushes of your hand during the date, but the same exact feeling was replicated. The same beautiful, thrilling feeling. The unsurety of what happens next, but the mutual knowledge that this was going to grow into something bigger.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t your ideal plan. You were certainly not planning to say it first, let alone say it after a round of Mario Kart, but somehow it was a relief. To know that you were on the same page as Peter lifted a weight of your shoulder. Of course, there was the shadow of doubt that this was all a figment of imagination. That you pretended he said that because that\u2019s what you expected to hear or that it was just an automatic response that he didn\u2019t mean. You broke the sweet silence with a gentle whisper, that said \u201cYou do?\u201d. </p><p>Peter bit his lip, he does. He knows he does. He loves the way you play with his hair and the light kisses you leave on his cheek. He could get lost in your laughter and he just wanted to make you laugh forever, just to hear it.

He likes how he can talk to you for hours with no end and you never get bored, even if it\u2019s him discussing Star Wars for the hundredth time. What he loves the most is the way you make him feel.

He was this angel of a boyfriend that it would be impossible to not fall in love with him. You were barely holding it together, he somehow made everything better that you had to tell him. He just had to know that he was epitome of sunshine and how hard you fell for him.</p><p>Then it would hit you out of nowhere. The fear that it wouldn&rsquo;t be reciprocated and that it would scare him off to be with someone else. The sole idea of pushing Peter away was terrifying, there was no way you could let him go easily. He was everything to you. So, your love was silenced but god, your heart could burst at the thought of him. Love songs on the radio made sense and you could understand why people would do crazy things for love. It was this rush, an addicting rush, that made you want to dance around like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. Love was a drug, as cheesy as it is. You were addicted to him, you needed him to be with you like you need oxygen. Though you were sure about your feelings, you just wanted to wait for Peter to say the words first. It just made sense.</p><p>Peter bit his lips, his eyebrows scrunched as he stared down the TV. He glanced over at you, just long enough for him to not notice the green shell headed his way. By the time his concentration is back on the screen, he was knocked down into sixth place and he was forced to watch some characters whizz by. He groaned in frustration, as Yoshi started to roll back up. &ldquo;What the heck? This isn&rsquo;t even fair.&rdquo;</p><p>You violently jerked your remote to the left, avoiding the corner of the castle. You let out a small laugh as Peter struggled to battle his way back up during the last lap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that you suck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me? What place are you in?&rdquo; Peter says, a slight offended tone weaved through his question.</p><p>&ldquo;First place,&rdquo; You said with a smirk playing on your lips. Luigi never failed you once.</p><p>Peter sticked his elbow out, hitting you hand to the side. Your eyes widen as you go astray, heading straight into the grass that no one ever wanted to be. A gasp that could be heard throughout the city left your lips. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He asked innocently, pretending as if he hadn&rsquo;t done the ultimate act of war.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t just do that,&rdquo; you exclaimed. Your heart drop with your place. Anger was brewing deep within you, this wasn&rsquo;t just a game. Your pride was on the line and there was no way you would let it go. You quickly attempted to recover your throne, passing Peach but Walugi is putting up a good fight. </p><p>&ldquo;This game is brutal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see why Ned dosen&rsquo;t play Mario Kart with you now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, he just acts like a sore loser when he loses. This isn&rsquo;t about me, plus you&rsquo;re doing fine,&rdquo; Peter said rolling his eyes.</p><p>You brushed off the comment and get hypnotized by the game unfolding. You push past Walugi, putting you back on your rightful throne. The finish line was so close, behind the bend was the checkered painted ground that would make you victorious. Victory would taste so sweet. But you didn&rsquo;t see it coming. You didn&rsquo;t see Peter gaining the yellow star that would transform him into a holographic mess. How the flashing, color-changing Yoshi had crept up on you. Victory flashed before your eyes, but then all of sudden, Luigi rolls around and Yoshi passed by with a Peter screaming with pride. Cars rushed past, making you fifth place in the scheme of things.</p><p>&ldquo;I won! I won!&rdquo; Peter shouted. He launched off the couch, throwing his hands up in the air. He spun around to face you, with the biggest smile plastered on his face. However your face was flat, no emotions shown and your mouth agape that your crown was stolen from right below you. Peter sucked in a breath, judging from the hostile look behind your eyes, you were not here for this. &ldquo;Are you, um, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter lowered his arms, fear ran up his spine. The next thing he knows, he&rsquo;s crouching in front of you, his eye level matching yours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he spitted out, the panic so clear.</p><p>A smile spread from the corner of your mouth before growing into this uncontrollable laughter at Peters reaction. There was no way you could get your blood boiling at him, especially for this. Yes, you were pissed, but Peter was Peter. Laughter carried through the air, infecting Peter. He&rsquo;s gasping for air, shaking his head with you. He reached out for your arm, using you for support as he tried to fight it off. God, he was adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not mad?&rdquo; Peter said between his gasps for air.</p><p>Your eyes crinkled at the corner, as you watched Peter settle back down. Your mouth was moving before you knew what you were saying. &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re lucky that I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; Peter said without missing a beat.</p><p>&ldquo;Another round?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm, maybe we could order pizza?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah of course, but can we order fr-&ldquo; Your voice trailed off, the reality of the conversation setting in. That was it. Three little words let out in the open to run wild and free now. Three littles words that made your heart stop mid-beat and blossomed a whole entire garden within you.</p><p>Peters cheeks tint with the lightest pink, his eyes trained on the ground. His heart pounds against his chest, but it mustn&rsquo;t be mistaken for fear. It was the type that could only come from pure bliss. The type that makes butterflies come alive and makes life feel too good to be real.</p><p>The air disappears from the room, both of you holding a breath. Hearts were soaring and shy glances were shared. It was a reminiscent of the first date in a way. There was nervous laughter and shy brushes of your hand during the date, but the same exact feeling was replicated. The same beautiful, thrilling feeling. The unsurety of what happens next, but the mutual knowledge that this was going to grow into something bigger.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t your ideal plan. You were certainly not planning to say it first, let alone say it after a round of Mario Kart, but somehow it was a relief. To know that you were on the same page as Peter lifted a weight of your shoulder. Of course, there was the shadow of doubt that this was all a figment of imagination. That you pretended he said that because that&rsquo;s what you expected to hear or that it was just an automatic response that he didn&rsquo;t mean. You broke the sweet silence with a gentle whisper, that said &ldquo;You do?&rdquo;. </p><p>Peter bit his lip, he does. He knows he does. He loves the way you play with his hair and the light kisses you leave on his cheek. He could get lost in your laughter and he just wanted to make you laugh forever, just to hear it. He adores the way you naturally lean on him and how you feel so right in his arms. He likes how he can talk to you for hours with no end and you never get bored, even if it&rsquo;s him discussing Star Wars for the hundredth time. What he loves the most is the way you make him feel. All of his armor falls and he&rsquo;s just him. He was enough with you, he didn&rsquo;t have to think twice about anything, everything was just so right. At the same time, he was always at the edge of his seat. Being with you made him feel like he was truly living, it was a rush of adrenaline everyday. Somehow, you were a safe haven and a spontaneous adventure at the same time.</p><p>Of course, people would pass this off as stupid teenager love. It was just the honeymoon phase before everything crumbled down. The thing was, Peter wants it all. He wants the bad days when you&rsquo;re crying a river. He wants the sick days where you haven&rsquo;t seen sunlight in days. He wants the rough days where you&rsquo;re going insane from exams and can&rsquo;t deal with anything. He wants the days where everyone and everything annoys you. He wants it all.</p><p>Maybe he didn&rsquo;t recognize it directly, the feeling of love, but he certainly felt it. There was no other explanation it. He wants you when you&rsquo;re all put together but he also wants you at three a.m., sleep deprived and unconherient. He wants to see your thrive but catch you when you stumble. He wants the good and bad. He didn&rsquo;t understand it, but at the same time he did. He said it so easily, that he had to know somewhere, and now he knows what this feeling was. It was love. </p><p>So when you ask that question, your focus down and heat rising to you cheeks, he knows the answer. &ldquo;Yeah, I do.&rdquo;</p><p>When you looked up to make eye contact with Peter who was still crouching down, your heart fluttered as his response. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; you asked with a small smile growing.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Peter said, still breathless at the discovery. </p><p>You&rsquo;re full out beaming at Peter, his heart could burst at the sight. You were out of this world, you must be in heaven because this is too good to be true. Your cheeks hurt from the straining smile, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. <i>He loves you</i>. Your hands flew out to his face, as you pull him closer til your lips connected. Your hands moved from his face to wrapping around his neck. He kissed so soft, that it makes you feel like it was the first time. When you pull away, you closed your eyes as you rested your forehead against his. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you whispered, your voice cracking. It was still a new sentence that you weren&rsquo;t used to saying, but that would change. You know it.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said, his hands on your waist. He closed his eyes with yours, his heartbeat syncing with yours.</p><p>The familiar smile that hadn&rsquo;t left your face gets stronger if that&rsquo;s possible. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>A small giggle left your lips. It was like you were seven when you would exchange crushes and burst into giggly laughter. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>You threw your head back, the giggle transforming into laughter. &ldquo;I love you, I love you, I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter joined into the bubbling joy that was bursting from your lips, god, he loved this. He loves you. &ldquo;I love you, I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, we&rsquo;re going to become that couple,&rdquo; You said through broken laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gonna be disgusted with us.&rdquo; You shook your head, but that stupid smile was still there.</p><p>Peter finally stood, arching his back in a stretch. He held his hands out for you to place your own in his, as he pulled you up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy I could dance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To the background noise of Mario Kart?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, of course. The most romantic sound ever,&rdquo; Peter said, wiggling his eyebrows in a mockingly seductive way.</p><p>Peter begins to swing your conjoined hands between you. &ldquo;Oh my god, you&rsquo;re such a nerd.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A nerd that you love.&rdquo; He said with a knowing look.</p><p>&ldquo;You got me there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I always got you,&rdquo; he joked. He lets go of one of your hands to spin you right into his arms. His arms snaked around you, holding you close.</p><p>Whatever he did always made that smile never leave. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so cliche.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Tagging some mutuals who may like my shitty writing: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHroWymxnoTn-S5YHqCtLNg\">@theamazingspiderlingg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT-x-MTiMyRqYIFlH3Tqb4g\">@princeofsassgard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_6FniXy7X-mooNbpp8r2w\">@dudewherearethepeaches</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYFEnb_SCeZM747t7uJ-rMQ\">@hollandsosterfield</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjSytOf70Vuk-IW_uSRR7rA\">@vnderoos</a> </p></p>",

He was back at the apartment now, and while things weren\u2019t any worse than they were before, they certainly weren\u2019t any better. You tiptoed around one another, and even when you were laying in bed together, holding each other close, you could feel the barrier between you. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>Time seemed to be warping lately, making the days drag by yet surprise you when you see just how many of those days had passed. It had only been a couple of weeks since everything had happened, yet it felt like it should have been a couple of months. But now Christmas was right around the corner and you didn\u2019t have any gift shopping done. The Christmas tree wasn\u2019t up, no Christmas cookies were baked, the decorations were still in the office you and Peter had dubbed a storage room, and still you had no motivation to do any of it. Not without Peter. Peter was what made Christmas&hellip;well, <i>Christmas</i>. You had to do it, though. Maybe you could text Peter a few names to pick up gifts for\u2014Tony, Bruce, Rhodey, and&hellip; Steve, perhaps. </p><p>No, not Steve. Tony? Sure. Rhodey? Why not? And Bruce? Even better. <i>But not Steve.</i> You were just as close to him as Peter was, and because of that you <i>always </i>picked out his gift together. But unless something drastically changed within a week, one of you was going to have to do it on your own. </p><p>You knew it wasn\u2019t going to. </p><p>Your stomach turned violently, causing you to rush to the toilet. You\u2019d been feeling sicker than usual the past few days now, but you\u2019d never actually thrown up until now. Thank goodness Peter was already at work, or he would be worried as all get out. Not to mention it\u2019d make talking honestly and openly impossible if Peter thought for even one second that it was him who\u2019d caused you to be physically ill. But he would only be half right, because you were as much a part of this as he was; you were both equally responsible. </p><p>With a still-turning stomach and a heavy heart, you stood and continued your morning routine, leaving for work ten minutes later. Work equaled distraction, and distraction equaled a blank mind\u2014just like every other day. <br/></p><p>&mdash;</p><hr><p>The pan sizzled as the vegetables fried inside it, and the smell surprisingly didn\u2019t send your stomach into another frenzy. Stir fry was safe. You made a mental note of that. </p><p>The door to the apartment opened, and your heart beat quicker at Peter\u2019s presence; that used to be a good thing, but now your racing pulse was for entirely different reasons. Reasons you still weren\u2019t brave enough to bring up. </p><p>\u201cIt smells good,\u201d Peter offered with a weak smile when he came into the kitchen, his voice unsure.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said just as unsurely, but more stiff. </p><p>Silence fell over the room, and just a few weeks ago you\u2019d have found it alarming (you and Peter always kept the conversation going unless something was seriously wrong), but now it was normal. It was just like every other day. </p><p>Seriously wrong had turned into normal. Funny how that worked. </p><p>While you were finishing up with the stir fry, Peter pulled two plates and cups from the cupboard, setting the table without a word. Your stomach twisted again at the reminder that this wasn\u2019t how it used to be, but you managed to calm it with a quick internal scolding. It didn\u2019t mean, however, that you weren\u2019t still dying for Peter to sneak his arms around you from behind and rest his chin on your shoulder as you dished up your plates, or that you didn\u2019t still want to sweep all this under the rug so you could kiss him again without feeling guilty. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;Y/N? Y/N, you there?\u201d</p><p>You startled, only now realizing you\u2019d been standing in the same position for who knows how long. \u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2026.sorry,\u201d you replied, shaking your head as you walked the pan to the table. </p><p>Peter was staring\u2014you could feel his eyes burning into the back of your head\u2014and when you turned to meet his gaze you saw the unspoken question of: <i>Are you okay? </i>But he never voiced it, probably knowing the answer already. He instead swallowed and cleared his throat, shoving his hands in his pockets and slightly dipping his head as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2018s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>The question was dangerous, but you were sure he knew that. Peter was too intelligent not to\u2014which also happened to be the reason you couldn\u2019t lie to him. The boy would pick up on it in an instant. But you didn\u2019t have to tell the whole truth either.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get Steve a present,\u201d you said quietly, watching as your husband\u2019s eyes lit up for a moment at the mentioning of the superhero\u2019s name then dimming again when you finished your sentence. It made your heart hurt to see Peter look so&hellip;hopeless. You\u2019d only seen it once, and that was after Titan. He still struggled as did you, which was why you were back in the same bed at night, and you knew you couldn\u2019t keep this up much longer. Neither of you.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, his voice far away. \u201cYeah, Christmas is coming soon.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t answer, only took a deep breath and let it out slowly through your nose. Your hands were shaking and you felt a bit dizzy. Stumbling, you hurried to sit down and drink from the water glass Peter had gotten for you. He didn\u2019t move at the sight of you nearly collapsing into a chair, though, which made you start to worry. </p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d No reply. His eyes stared blankly at the wall, lifeless. \u201cPeter? Hey, you in there?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react, making your worry spike. You knew how bad his panic attacks could get, and while this kind wasn\u2019t as physically taxing as the kind where he felt like all he could breathe in was ash, it was equally terrifying to witness. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the apartment. You\u2019re with me. I\u2019m here. You\u2019re solid, okay?\u201d you said gently, reaching for his hand. He let you take it. \u201cPeter, I\u2019m right here-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDo you want a divorce?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Your heart stopped beating and your entire body froze. Peter tightened his hold on your now slipping hand but kept his eyes trained on the wall, and that\u2019s when you realized he hadn\u2019t been having a panic attack at all. He\u2019d just been letting that question\u2014that horrid, <i>awful </i>question\u2014bounce around his head and slowly creep to the tip of his tongue until it exited through his lips. No wonder he had looked so lifeless. </p><p>Your stomach flipped. Suddenly the stir fry didn\u2019t seem as appetizing as before. </p><p>\u201cW\u2026.what?\u201d you whispered. </p><p>Peter looked down, finally away from the wall, then up at you. He went to say something then shut his mouth, closing his eyes as if he were in pain. </p><p>You really didn\u2019t need Peter to repeat the question\u2014you really didn\u2019t <i>want </i>him to\u2014but considering you still couldn\u2019t form any other words that indicated so, you had to watch and listen as he did. </p><p>\u201cI&hellip;do you want a divorce?\u201d he said again, this time a little less sure but just as seriously. </p><p>The room began to spin a little, though you weren\u2019t sure if it was because of the insane amount of pain you were in or because of the shock. Probably both. </p><p>Your heart may as well have stopped with all the beats it\u2019d skipped and still was skipping. It was cracking\u2014ripping right in half\u2014making your entire being buzz in alarm and activate a fight or flight mode you hadn\u2019t felt in a while\u2014had had no <i>reason </i>to feel. Your stomach was turning, your hands were shaking, and your mouth was dry as you somehow rounded up enough of your brain to choke out, \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t flinch at the question, which made you that much closer to retching in the nearest trash can. It was almost as if he\u2019d been <i>expecting </i>this. </p><p>Just how long had he been preparing for this?</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you said desperately, your voice cracking in the middle of it. \u201cAnswer me. <i>Please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes at your squeezing of his hand and gave your locked palms a look you couldn\u2019t quite put your finger on. There was obvious pain in his eyes as he raised them and placed a gentle kiss on the back of yours. \u201cI-I love you,\u201d he said, his voice wavering, and your heart dropped when he let go of your hand. </p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c you started, panic in your tone, but he didn\u2019t let you complete your thought. </p><p>\u201cBut this\u2014what we\u2019re doing\u2014it\u2019s&hellip;it\u2019s destroying us. I can\u2019t keep sitting back and watching everything we\u2019ve built crumble into\u2026\u201d Peter faltered, swallowing before going on. \u201c&hellip;into dust. I think-I think that we both deserve happiness. And this isn\u2019t it. I just&hellip;I know you\u2019re mad at me and I want to fix it but I can\u2019t, because I can\u2019t promise you that I\u2019ll never go on a mission again. Spider-Man means so much to me and to the people and I can\u2019t just&hellip;I can\u2019t promise that.\u201d He paused, looking at you with the soft brown orbs you\u2019d fallen in love with the minute they laid eyes on you. \u201cI can promise that I love you with everything I have and that I always will, but I can\u2019t&hellip;I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>A panic you\u2019d never felt clawed at you, tearing holes in your heart and your lungs and your soul, leaving you struggling for air like a fish out of water. Only\u2014you knew how to breathe. You knew there was air to breathe. It was simple: inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, over and over and over again. It shouldn\u2019t be <i>that hard</i>. </p><p>You finally understood what Peter meant when he told you that having a panic attack was like suffocating against your own will\u2014not drowning, because there was still air, and not choking, because there were no outside forces that were responsible for it. <i>Suffocating</i>, because you physically couldn\u2019t breathe when you should be perfectly able\u2014when everyone else was perfectly able. </p><p>Inhale, exhale. It was that simple. And yet, your lungs refused to take in any of the air you were so desperate for. </p><p>Despite your immense dizziness and slightly blackened vision\u2014<i>just how long had your lungs been empty?</i>\u2014you managed to stand and make your way to the nearest trash can. </p><p>You retched. <br/></p><p>&mdash;</p><hr><p>Neither of you brought the topic back up, not wanting a repeat of last time. Fortunately, this meant that the \u2018D\u2019 word was never spoken again. <i>Un</i>fortunately, this also meant that there was a surplus of words that needed to be said and weren\u2019t, leading you further away from each other. You didn\u2019t even speak anymore other than to remind one another of some event or appointment you had the next day. You were running on autopilot, relying on muscle memory to get you through each day. You were sure Peter felt the same. </p><p>You and Peter ended up splitting the team up and buying gifts for whoever was in your half (you ended up buying Steve\u2019s), and while Peter got May and Happy their gifts, you got Pepper and the Barton family theirs. The Christmas decorations didn\u2019t come out, there wasn\u2019t any Christmas cookie dough in the fridge, and the Christmas tree never got picked from your favorite tree farm. No one ever came over\u2014it was always <i>to </i>the compound or <i>to </i>May\u2019s\u2014so you didn\u2019t have to worry about anyone noticing. </p><p>You still went to Sunday dinners together, and though you were never particularly hungry you ate until you were uncomfortably full on those days to make up for the diet you\u2019d had the rest of the week. You and Peter found it was easier and less awkward if you split up at dinner, putting on the fa\u00e7ade of needing to catch up with the girls and him the boys, you about any and all new developments in each one\u2019s life and Peter about the latest technology Tony had been working with. That wasn\u2019t to say the team didn\u2019t catch on\u2014after all, they <i>were </i>trained to pick up on these sort of things\u2014but they left it alone for the most part (\u2018most part\u2019 referring to the funny looks they sometimes gave one another), believing that by next week you\u2019d have it all worked out. </p><p>But then one week passed, and then the next, and then the next. </p><p>And now it was Christmas. Things were as low as you thought it could possibly get with Peter and you were dying to fix it, but every time you thought you\u2019d try you remembered how last time went and immediately lost every ounce of courage you\u2019d managed to gather. Peter sometimes did the same, late at night when you were laying in bed with nothing to say. His jaw would open then snap shut a half a second later, and you didn\u2019t have to ask any questions because you <i>knew</i>. </p><p>Peter was right: this wasn\u2019t happiness. But he <i>was </i>wrong about you being mad at him. That had long passed, replaced by anxiety and despair. You weren\u2019t mad. You actually weren\u2019t sure if you ever were. Irritated, maybe, at most. Disappointed and betrayed seemed like more appropriate words for what you\u2019d felt. But you still loved him; nothing had changed there. And Peter had openly confessed to still loving you (<i>and that he always would</i>), so you had hope. Some days the hope was hard to find, having been buried under a pile of heavy thoughts and emotions, but somehow it always worked its way back to the top, if only for a second. But a second was enough; it had to be. It had to be, or you would have been hopeless a long time ago. </p><p>\u201cIs that everything?\u201d </p><p>You nodded then frowned, looking around desperately. \u201cYeah, but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI, uh, took your purse out to the car already. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Peter said quietly, rubbing the back of his neck. Your heart clenched. </p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d You cleared your throat, quickly looking away before he could see the tears forming in your eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence. Then two. </p><p>\u201cY/N, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPete, I know where you\u2019re going,\u201d you weakly interrupted. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. We-we have to go or we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>His lips sealed shut and he agreeably nodded, then ushered you both to the car. He still held the door open for you as you clambered in and made sure you were buckled in before taking off, and you had to pretend you were really interested in whatever was outside so he wouldn\u2019t see the tears that had overflowed. You decided right then and there that being a girl had never sucked more. <i>Damn hormones. </i></p><p>You clutched your purse the entire way upstate. <br/></p><p>&mdash;</p><hr><p>Neither of you made a move to get out of the car when you got to the compound, neither of you ready to go through yet another day of pretending everything was fine when it was really far from it. </p><p>Peter spoke first. </p><p>\u201cBefore we go in,\u201d he said, his brows furrowed slightly and the corners of his mouth tilted down, \u201cI need to ask you something and I need you to be honest with me about it.\u201d</p><p>Your heart dropped, your mind replaying the same question he\u2019d already asked you twice with a less than favorable outcome. Peter must have dissected the look on your face, though, and rushed to fix it. </p><p>\u201cAll things aside,\u201d he quickly added, his eyes a bit wider now. \u201cI just need to ask you something that\u2019s been bothering me for a few weeks now, and I don\u2019t think I can make it through Christmas without knowing the answer.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed and held your purse tighter, but slowly nodded your agreement. Peter nodded too, then turned away to figure out how to ask what he wanted. It was a good minute before he faced you again, and the blatant concern in his eyes surprised you. </p><p>\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>You blinked. \u201cLike&hellip;like with the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter shook his head, then paused and gave you a second look. \u201cBut&hellip;wait, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d you said, more confused than ever. \u201cPeter, what do you mean, am I in trouble? Am I in trouble with who? With what? I don\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d he exclaimed, sighing and tugging at his curls. \u201cWith-with Spider-Man, or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, unless I somehow misread the past five years, I thought <i>you </i>were Spider-Man-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, yes, I <i>am</i>, but I\n\u2014\n\nthat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Peter interrupted again, this time much more frustrated. He wasn\u2019t looking at you now, his head instead aimed down at his lap. Your unspoken question was in the air\u2014<i>Then, what </i>do <i>you mean?</i>\u2014but it took Peter a little bit to get around to it. \u201cYou know how I said my senses were dialed up to 11? When I told you I was Spider-Man?\u201d</p><p>Maybe if Peter didn\u2019t look so distressed you\u2019d think of a sarcastic quip to insert, something about how he thought you could forget that night, but you didn\u2019t feel up to doing that, anyway. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you&hellip;you\u2019ve been different lately,\u201d Peter started. </p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d you said less harshly but more pointedly, \u201cso have you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>You could tell your words hurt him and you regretted becoming so defensive so fast. \u201cThat\u2019s&hellip;that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Peter weakly said. </p><p>You resorted to another bout of silence\u2014one full of tension. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re going to have to explain,\u201d you said eventually. </p><p>He sighed and lifted his head, staring out the windshield. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the same room, the hairs on the back of my neck tingle and I can just&hellip;it\u2019s like I can sense something\u2019s <i>wrong </i>but I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s not exactly my spidey sense because I don\u2019t go into fight-or-flight or feel like I\u2019m in danger, it\u2019s just different because something with you is different. <i>Off. </i>You look the same but there\u2019s something off with everything else\u2014like your scent. I mean, you smell almost exactly the same so maybe I\u2019m just imagining it, and I\u2019m sure I only noticed the difference because of my spidey sense going off, but my point is-\u201d He paused to catch his breath. \u201cI just&hellip;I need to know if you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d he continued, more softly than before. \u201cIf someone figured out who I am and is using you to get to me or-or something. It\u2019s been driving me insane.\u201d</p><p>Peter was wringing his fingers, something you knew he did when he felt anxious. You swallowed hard and reached over to place your hand atop his. His fingers stilled. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in trouble, Pete,\u201d you whispered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He turned to you again, searching your eyes. He must have found what he was looking for, as soon after he breathed a small sigh of relief and his shoulders dropped. \u201cOkay. Okay, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll just&hellip;talk to Tony or someone about my spidey sense\u2014call this time a misfire and see if we can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Peter went on to mumble about the so-called \u2018misfire\u2019 and probable causes behind it. You couldn\u2019t make out half the words he was saying, but from what you could he seemed to be talking in circles, always landing back at square one. He seemed a bit frustrated. </p><p>You went back to holding your purse tightly to you, and an array of thoughts went through your head that subsequently caused you to take a deep breath and interrupt him. </p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d He stopped mumbling and immediately trained his eyes on you. It was only then that you realized just how dark his bags were underneath them; no, you hadn\u2019t been sleeping well either, but Peter looked like he hadn\u2019t slept in <i>days</i>. You couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it was because of his spidey sense constantly going off around you. Another breath. \u201cPeter, I think I might know why-\u201c</p><p>You never got to finish. <br/></p><p>&mdash;<br/></p><p><b>Promises Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOnsSCSSx4ltbVhx0owm8qw\">@mintaeroandmerlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf4mejqHgKiR0ahJ7kyUSfg\">@thehollandfam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDAr46nDNjAAmQEkGhtPyOQ\">@trumpettay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLvIVEVLIwg82n_IfdMaAbw\">@ganggangganggg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msNfpXCmwE7cXPuWdI3rRcg\">@secretagentben</a> @rayanismybae* <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mikZOy8p84bvQaUHxlLRgwQ\">@yellowkenyon97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOyeBuPCE5QyG5TdPLY2Kaw\">@shewhoshallnotswear</a>\u00a0<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Permanent Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjNClJexuRFTOQ9-khMdx1Q\">@my-meant-to-find-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz7ChuIQ5ZjkoQaaiqvdGkQ\">@jongindeepbreath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma08NSt4lY7lBnZYFQkaCng\">@tomspideyweb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6O5pKbczlRwnnOYxcAGtlg\">@farfromjustordinary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXjNONbv1_Gf6Cll1qAiOVA\">@tomsstarlight</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAt2oGH5Hk9qUtYI1Q2ZLIQ\">@delicately-written</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjf-SfZ0jSuN16xK4UJIPAQ\">@catstielanddeanthedog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTE3Z5FQUWRPOSjO1lXe__g\">@tom-holland-and-textposts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfYQpjtTlzRjZ1yGBhP6cHw\">@spiderman-n</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdxpq2Zc1jX6K4KSPo4CG7Q\">@wtfholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mstVju9TfY8-Hb2YYhJG-Pg\">@hollandandi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwW0mLpbQ0a-_4wahdoDxmA\">@starsholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CX9BzzOAoQyJ9IhM18kzQ\">@beautiful-holland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvLrxz0kUoxa2FH6UZRlSFw\">@spideycentral-1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@yoinksholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-gTmxeOOXe5tFoYzP76OQ\">@antifaspiderman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKyE4hPtVsqe3tlBLQFHI9w\">@trashqueenbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mylVR9EUR1f_B6fqn71tejQ\">@fireboltrose7559</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjwlOl2Xy5pvbKPhQDIpYxg\">@perhaps-he-schnapped</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_L08i7caegOXnQ7xtnIosQ\">@ofserien</a>\u00a0<b><br/></b></p><p><b><i>Let me know if you want to be added!\n<i><b>\ud83d\udc95\n\n</b></i>\n\n</i></b><br/></p>",

You tiptoed around one another, and even when you were laying in bed together, holding each other close, you could feel the barrier between you. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Time seemed to be warping lately, making the days drag by yet surprise you when you see just how many of those days had passed. It had only been a couple of weeks since everything had happened, yet it felt like it should have been a couple of months. But now Christmas was right around the corner and you didn\u2019t have any gift shopping done. The Christmas tree wasn\u2019t up, no Christmas cookies were baked, the decorations were still in the office you and Peter had dubbed a storage room, and still you had no motivation to do any of it. Not without Peter. Peter was what made Christmas\u2026well, <i>Christmas</i>. You had to do it, though. Maybe you could text Peter a few names to pick up gifts for\u2014Tony, Bruce, Rhodey, and\u2026 Steve, perhaps. </p><p>No, not Steve. Tony? Sure. Rhodey? Why not? And Bruce? Even better. <i>But not Steve.</i> You were just as close to him as Peter was, and because of that you <i>always </i>picked out his gift together. But unless something drastically changed within a week, one of you was going to have to do it on your own. </p><p>You knew it wasn\u2019t going to. </p><p>Your stomach turned violently, causing you to rush to the toilet. You\u2019d been feeling sicker than usual the past few days now, but you\u2019d never actually thrown up until now. Thank goodness Peter was already at work, or he would be worried as all get out. Not to mention it\u2019d make talking honestly and openly impossible if Peter thought for even one second that it was him who\u2019d caused you to be physically ill. But he would only be half right, because you were as much a part of this as he was; you were both equally responsible. </p><p>With a still-turning stomach and a heavy heart, you stood and continued your morning routine, leaving for work ten minutes later. Work equaled distraction, and distraction equaled a blank mind\u2014just like every other day. <br></p><p>\u2014</p><hr><p>The pan sizzled as the vegetables fried inside it, and the smell surprisingly didn\u2019t send your stomach into another frenzy. Stir fry was safe. You made a mental note of that. </p><p>The door to the apartment opened, and your heart beat quicker at Peter\u2019s presence; that used to be a good thing, but now your racing pulse was for entirely different reasons. Reasons you still weren\u2019t brave enough to bring up. </p><p>\u201cIt smells good,\u201d Peter offered with a weak smile when he came into the kitchen, his voice unsure.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said just as unsurely, but more stiff. </p><p>Silence fell over the room, and just a few weeks ago you\u2019d have found it alarming (you and Peter always kept the conversation going unless something was seriously wrong), but now it was normal. It was just like every other day. </p><p>Seriously wrong had turned into normal. Funny how that worked. </p><p>While you were finishing up with the stir fry, Peter pulled two plates and cups from the cupboard, setting the table without a word. Your stomach twisted again at the reminder that this wasn\u2019t how it used to be, but you managed to calm it with a quick internal scolding. It didn\u2019t mean, however, that you weren\u2019t still dying for Peter to sneak his arms around you from behind and rest his chin on your shoulder as you dished up your plates, or that you didn\u2019t still want to sweep all this under the rug so you could kiss him again without feeling guilty. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Y/N? Y/N, you there?\u201d</p><p>You startled, only now realizing you\u2019d been standing in the same position for who knows how long. \u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2026.sorry,\u201d you replied, shaking your head as you walked the pan to the table. </p><p>Peter was staring\u2014you could feel his eyes burning into the back of your head\u2014and when you turned to meet his gaze you saw the unspoken question of: <i>Are you okay? </i>But he never voiced it, probably knowing the answer already. He instead swallowed and cleared his throat, shoving his hands in his pockets and slightly dipping his head as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2018s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>The question was dangerous, but you were sure he knew that. Peter was too intelligent not to\u2014which also happened to be the reason you couldn\u2019t lie to him. The boy would pick up on it in an instant. But you didn\u2019t have to tell the whole truth either.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get Steve a present,\u201d you said quietly, watching as your husband\u2019s eyes lit up for a moment at the mentioning of the superhero\u2019s name then dimming again when you finished your sentence. It made your heart hurt to see Peter look so\u2026hopeless. You\u2019d only seen it once, and that was after Titan. He still struggled as did you, which was why you were back in the same bed at night, and you knew you couldn\u2019t keep this up much longer. Neither of you.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, his voice far away. \u201cYeah, Christmas is coming soon.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t answer, only took a deep breath and let it out slowly through your nose. Your hands were shaking and you felt a bit dizzy. Stumbling, you hurried to sit down and drink from the water glass Peter had gotten for you. He didn\u2019t move at the sight of you nearly collapsing into a chair, though, which made you start to worry. </p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d No reply. His eyes stared blankly at the wall, lifeless. \u201cPeter? Hey, you in there?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react, making your worry spike. You knew how bad his panic attacks could get, and while this kind wasn\u2019t as physically taxing as the kind where he felt like all he could breathe in was ash, it was equally terrifying to witness. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the apartment. You\u2019re with me. I\u2019m here. You\u2019re solid, okay?\u201d you said gently, reaching for his hand. He let you take it. \u201cPeter, I\u2019m right here-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDo you want a divorce?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Your heart stopped beating and your entire body froze. Peter tightened his hold on your now slipping hand but kept his eyes trained on the wall, and that\u2019s when you realized he hadn\u2019t been having a panic attack at all. He\u2019d just been letting that question\u2014that horrid, <i>awful </i>question\u2014bounce around his head and slowly creep to the tip of his tongue until it exited through his lips. No wonder he had looked so lifeless. </p><p>Your stomach flipped. Suddenly the stir fry didn\u2019t seem as appetizing as before. </p><p>\u201cW\u2026.what?\u201d you whispered. </p><p>Peter looked down, finally away from the wall, then up at you. He went to say something then shut his mouth, closing his eyes as if he were in pain. </p><p>You really didn\u2019t need Peter to repeat the question\u2014you really didn\u2019t <i>want </i>him to\u2014but considering you still couldn\u2019t form any other words that indicated so, you had to watch and listen as he did. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026do you want a divorce?\u201d he said again, this time a little less sure but just as seriously. </p><p>The room began to spin a little, though you weren\u2019t sure if it was because of the insane amount of pain you were in or because of the shock. Probably both. </p><p>Your heart may as well have stopped with all the beats it\u2019d skipped and still was skipping. It was cracking\u2014ripping right in half\u2014making your entire being buzz in alarm and activate a fight or flight mode you hadn\u2019t felt in a while\u2014had had no <i>reason </i>to feel. Your stomach was turning, your hands were shaking, and your mouth was dry as you somehow rounded up enough of your brain to choke out, \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t flinch at the question, which made you that much closer to retching in the nearest trash can. It was almost as if he\u2019d been <i>expecting </i>this. </p><p>Just how long had he been preparing for this?</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you said desperately, your voice cracking in the middle of it. \u201cAnswer me. <i>Please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes at your squeezing of his hand and gave your locked palms a look you couldn\u2019t quite put your finger on. There was obvious pain in his eyes as he raised them and placed a gentle kiss on the back of yours. \u201cI-I love you,\u201d he said, his voice wavering, and your heart dropped when he let go of your hand. </p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c you started, panic in your tone, but he didn\u2019t let you complete your thought. </p><p>\u201cBut this\u2014what we\u2019re doing\u2014it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s destroying us. I can\u2019t keep sitting back and watching everything we\u2019ve built crumble into\u2026\u201d Peter faltered, swallowing before going on. \u201c\u2026into dust. I think-I think that we both deserve happiness. And this isn\u2019t it. I just\u2026I know you\u2019re mad at me and I want to fix it but I can\u2019t, because I can\u2019t promise you that I\u2019ll never go on a mission again. Spider-Man means so much to me and to the people and I can\u2019t just\u2026I can\u2019t promise that.\u201d He paused, looking at you with the soft brown orbs you\u2019d fallen in love with the minute they laid eyes on you. \u201cI can promise that I love you with everything I have and that I always will, but I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>A panic you\u2019d never felt clawed at you, tearing holes in your heart and your lungs and your soul, leaving you struggling for air like a fish out of water. Only\u2014you knew how to breathe. You knew there was air to breathe. It was simple: inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, over and over and over again. It shouldn\u2019t be <i>that hard</i>. </p><p>You finally understood what Peter meant when he told you that having a panic attack was like suffocating against your own will\u2014not drowning, because there was still air, and not choking, because there were no outside forces that were responsible for it. <i>Suffocating</i>, because you physically couldn\u2019t breathe when you should be perfectly able\u2014when everyone else was perfectly able. </p><p>Inhale, exhale. It was that simple. And yet, your lungs refused to take in any of the air you were so desperate for. </p><p>Despite your immense dizziness and slightly blackened vision\u2014<i>just how long had your lungs been empty?</i>\u2014you managed to stand and make your way to the nearest trash can. </p><p>You retched. <br></p><p>\u2014</p><hr><p>Neither of you brought the topic back up, not wanting a repeat of last time. Fortunately, this meant that the \u2018D\u2019 word was never spoken again. <i>Un</i>fortunately, this also meant that there was a surplus of words that needed to be said and weren\u2019t, leading you further away from each other. You didn\u2019t even speak anymore other than to remind one another of some event or appointment you had the next day. You were running on autopilot, relying on muscle memory to get you through each day. You were sure Peter felt the same. </p><p>You and Peter ended up splitting the team up and buying gifts for whoever was in your half (you ended up buying Steve\u2019s), and while Peter got May and Happy their gifts, you got Pepper and the Barton family theirs. The Christmas decorations didn\u2019t come out, there wasn\u2019t any Christmas cookie dough in the fridge, and the Christmas tree never got picked from your favorite tree farm. No one ever came over\u2014it was always <i>to </i>the compound or <i>to </i>May\u2019s\u2014so you didn\u2019t have to worry about anyone noticing. </p><p>You still went to Sunday dinners together, and though you were never particularly hungry you ate until you were uncomfortably full on those days to make up for the diet you\u2019d had the rest of the week. You and Peter found it was easier and less awkward if you split up at dinner, putting on the fa\u00e7ade of needing to catch up with the girls and him the boys, you about any and all new developments in each one\u2019s life and Peter about the latest technology Tony had been working with. That wasn\u2019t to say the team didn\u2019t catch on\u2014after all, they <i>were </i>trained to pick up on these sort of things\u2014but they left it alone for the most part (\u2018most part\u2019 referring to the funny looks they sometimes gave one another), believing that by next week you\u2019d have it all worked out. </p><p>But then one week passed, and then the next, and then the next. </p><p>And now it was Christmas. Things were as low as you thought it could possibly get with Peter and you were dying to fix it, but every time you thought you\u2019d try you remembered how last time went and immediately lost every ounce of courage you\u2019d managed to gather. Peter sometimes did the same, late at night when you were laying in bed with nothing to say. His jaw would open then snap shut a half a second later, and you didn\u2019t have to ask any questions because you <i>knew</i>. </p><p>Peter was right: this wasn\u2019t happiness. But he <i>was </i>wrong about you being mad at him. That had long passed, replaced by anxiety and despair. You weren\u2019t mad. You actually weren\u2019t sure if you ever were. Irritated, maybe, at most. Disappointed and betrayed seemed like more appropriate words for what you\u2019d felt. But you still loved him; nothing had changed there. And Peter had openly confessed to still loving you (<i>and that he always would</i>), so you had hope. Some days the hope was hard to find, having been buried under a pile of heavy thoughts and emotions, but somehow it always worked its way back to the top, if only for a second. But a second was enough; it had to be. It had to be, or you would have been hopeless a long time ago. </p><p>\u201cIs that everything?\u201d </p><p>You nodded then frowned, looking around desperately. \u201cYeah, but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI, uh, took your purse out to the car already. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Peter said quietly, rubbing the back of his neck. Your heart clenched. </p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d You cleared your throat, quickly looking away before he could see the tears forming in your eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence. Then two. </p><p>\u201cY/N, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPete, I know where you\u2019re going,\u201d you weakly interrupted. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. We-we have to go or we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>His lips sealed shut and he agreeably nodded, then ushered you both to the car. He still held the door open for you as you clambered in and made sure you were buckled in before taking off, and you had to pretend you were really interested in whatever was outside so he wouldn\u2019t see the tears that had overflowed. You decided right then and there that being a girl had never sucked more. <i>Damn hormones. </i></p><p>You clutched your purse the entire way upstate. <br></p><p>\u2014</p><hr><p>Neither of you made a move to get out of the car when you got to the compound, neither of you ready to go through yet another day of pretending everything was fine when it was really far from it. </p><p>Peter spoke first. </p><p>\u201cBefore we go in,\u201d he said, his brows furrowed slightly and the corners of his mouth tilted down, \u201cI need to ask you something and I need you to be honest with me about it.\u201d</p><p>Your heart dropped, your mind replaying the same question he\u2019d already asked you twice with a less than favorable outcome. Peter must have dissected the look on your face, though, and rushed to fix it. </p><p>\u201cAll things aside,\u201d he quickly added, his eyes a bit wider now. \u201cI just need to ask you something that\u2019s been bothering me for a few weeks now, and I don\u2019t think I can make it through Christmas without knowing the answer.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed and held your purse tighter, but slowly nodded your agreement. Peter nodded too, then turned away to figure out how to ask what he wanted. It was a good minute before he faced you again, and the blatant concern in his eyes surprised you. </p><p>\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>You blinked. \u201cLike\u2026like with the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter shook his head, then paused and gave you a second look. \u201cBut\u2026wait, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d you said, more confused than ever. \u201cPeter, what do you mean, am I in trouble? Am I in trouble with who? With what? I don\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d he exclaimed, sighing and tugging at his curls. \u201cWith-with Spider-Man, or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, unless I somehow misread the past five years, I thought <i>you </i>were Spider-Man-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, yes, I <i>am</i>, but I\n\u2014\n\nthat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Peter interrupted again, this time much more frustrated. He wasn\u2019t looking at you now, his head instead aimed down at his lap. Your unspoken question was in the air\u2014<i>Then, what </i>do <i>you mean?</i>\u2014but it took Peter a little bit to get around to it. \u201cYou know how I said my senses were dialed up to 11? When I told you I was Spider-Man?\u201d</p><p>Maybe if Peter didn\u2019t look so distressed you\u2019d think of a sarcastic quip to insert, something about how he thought you could forget that night, but you didn\u2019t feel up to doing that, anyway. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2026you\u2019ve been different lately,\u201d Peter started. </p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d you said less harshly but more pointedly, \u201cso have you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>You could tell your words hurt him and you regretted becoming so defensive so fast. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Peter weakly said. </p><p>You resorted to another bout of silence\u2014one full of tension. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re going to have to explain,\u201d you said eventually. </p><p>He sighed and lifted his head, staring out the windshield. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the same room, the hairs on the back of my neck tingle and I can just\u2026it\u2019s like I can sense something\u2019s <i>wrong </i>but I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s not exactly my spidey sense because I don\u2019t go into fight-or-flight or feel like I\u2019m in danger, it\u2019s just different because something with you is different. <i>Off. </i>You look the same but there\u2019s something off with everything else\u2014like your scent. I mean, you smell almost exactly the same so maybe I\u2019m just imagining it, and I\u2019m sure I only noticed the difference because of my spidey sense going off, but my point is-\u201d He paused to catch his breath. \u201cI just\u2026I need to know if you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d he continued, more softly than before. \u201cIf someone figured out who I am and is using you to get to me or-or something. It\u2019s been driving me insane.\u201d</p><p>Peter was wringing his fingers, something you knew he did when he felt anxious. You swallowed hard and reached over to place your hand atop his. His fingers stilled. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in trouble, Pete,\u201d you whispered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He turned to you again, searching your eyes. He must have found what he was looking for, as soon after he breathed a small sigh of relief and his shoulders dropped. \u201cOkay. Okay, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll just\u2026talk to Tony or someone about my spidey sense\u2014call this time a misfire and see if we can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Peter went on to mumble about the so-called \u2018misfire\u2019 and probable causes behind it. You couldn\u2019t make out half the words he was saying, but from what you could he seemed to be talking in circles, always landing back at square one. He seemed a bit frustrated. </p><p>You went back to holding your purse tightly to you, and an array of thoughts went through your head that subsequently caused you to take a deep breath and interrupt him. </p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d He stopped mumbling and immediately trained his eyes on you. It was only then that you realized just how dark his bags were underneath them; no, you hadn\u2019t been sleeping well either, but Peter looked like he hadn\u2019t slept in <i>days</i>. You couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it was because of his spidey sense constantly going off around you. Another breath. \u201cPeter, I think I might know why-\u201c</p><p>You never got to finish. <br></p><p>\u2014<br></p><p><b>Promises Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOnsSCSSx4ltbVhx0owm8qw\">@mintaeroandmerlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf4mejqHgKiR0ahJ7kyUSfg\">@thehollandfam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDAr46nDNjAAmQEkGhtPyOQ\">@trumpettay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLvIVEVLIwg82n_IfdMaAbw\">@ganggangganggg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msNfpXCmwE7cXPuWdI3rRcg\">@secretagentben</a> @rayanismybae* <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mikZOy8p84bvQaUHxlLRgwQ\">@yellowkenyon97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOyeBuPCE5QyG5TdPLY2Kaw\">@shewhoshallnotswear</a>\u00a0<b><br></b></p><p><b>Permanent Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjNClJexuRFTOQ9-khMdx1Q\">@my-meant-to-find-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz7ChuIQ5ZjkoQaaiqvdGkQ\">@jongindeepbreath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma08NSt4lY7lBnZYFQkaCng\">@tomspideyweb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6O5pKbczlRwnnOYxcAGtlg\">@farfromjustordinary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXjNONbv1_Gf6Cll1qAiOVA\">@tomsstarlight</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAt2oGH5Hk9qUtYI1Q2ZLIQ\">@delicately-written</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjf-SfZ0jSuN16xK4UJIPAQ\">@catstielanddeanthedog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTE3Z5FQUWRPOSjO1lXe__g\">@tom-holland-and-textposts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfYQpjtTlzRjZ1yGBhP6cHw\">@spiderman-n</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdxpq2Zc1jX6K4KSPo4CG7Q\">@wtfholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mstVju9TfY8-Hb2YYhJG-Pg\">@hollandandi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwW0mLpbQ0a-_4wahdoDxmA\">@starsholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CX9BzzOAoQyJ9IhM18kzQ\">@beautiful-holland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvLrxz0kUoxa2FH6UZRlSFw\">@spideycentral-1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@yoinksholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-gTmxeOOXe5tFoYzP76OQ\">@antifaspiderman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKyE4hPtVsqe3tlBLQFHI9w\">@trashqueenbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mylVR9EUR1f_B6fqn71tejQ\">@fireboltrose7559</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjwlOl2Xy5pvbKPhQDIpYxg\">@perhaps-he-schnapped</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_L08i7caegOXnQ7xtnIosQ\">@ofserien</a>\u00a0<b><br></b></p><p><b><i>Let me know if you want to be added!\n<i><b>\ud83d\udc95\n\n</b></i>\n\n</i></b><br></p>",

He was back at the apartment now, and while things weren\u2019t any worse than they were before, they certainly weren\u2019t any better. You tiptoed around one another, and even when you were laying in bed together, holding each other close, you could feel the barrier between you. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Time seemed to be warping lately, making the days drag by yet surprise you when you see just how many of those days had passed. It had only been a couple of weeks since everything had happened, yet it felt like it should have been a couple of months. But now Christmas was right around the corner and you didn\u2019t have any gift shopping done. The Christmas tree wasn\u2019t up, no Christmas cookies were baked, the decorations were still in the office you and Peter had dubbed a storage room, and still you had no motivation to do any of it. Not without Peter. Peter was what made Christmas\u2026well, <i>Christmas</i>. You had to do it, though. Maybe you could text Peter a few names to pick up gifts for\u2014Tony, Bruce, Rhodey, and\u2026 Steve, perhaps. </p><p>No, not Steve. Tony? Sure. Rhodey? Why not? And Bruce? Even better. <i>But not Steve.</i> You were just as close to him as Peter was, and because of that you <i>always </i>picked out his gift together. But unless something drastically changed within a week, one of you was going to have to do it on your own. </p><p>You knew it wasn\u2019t going to. </p><p>Your stomach turned violently, causing you to rush to the toilet. You\u2019d been feeling sicker than usual the past few days now, but you\u2019d never actually thrown up until now. Thank goodness Peter was already at work, or he would be worried as all get out. Not to mention it\u2019d make talking honestly and openly impossible if Peter thought for even one second that it was him who\u2019d caused you to be physically ill. But he would only be half right, because you were as much a part of this as he was; you were both equally responsible. </p><p>With a still-turning stomach and a heavy heart, you stood and continued your morning routine, leaving for work ten minutes later. Work equaled distraction, and distraction equaled a blank mind\u2014just like every other day. <br></p><p>\u2014</p><hr><p>The pan sizzled as the vegetables fried inside it, and the smell surprisingly didn\u2019t send your stomach into another frenzy. Stir fry was safe. You made a mental note of that. </p><p>The door to the apartment opened, and your heart beat quicker at Peter\u2019s presence; that used to be a good thing, but now your racing pulse was for entirely different reasons. Reasons you still weren\u2019t brave enough to bring up. </p><p>\u201cIt smells good,\u201d Peter offered with a weak smile when he came into the kitchen, his voice unsure.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said just as unsurely, but more stiff. </p><p>Silence fell over the room, and just a few weeks ago you\u2019d have found it alarming (you and Peter always kept the conversation going unless something was seriously wrong), but now it was normal. It was just like every other day. </p><p>Seriously wrong had turned into normal. Funny how that worked. </p><p>While you were finishing up with the stir fry, Peter pulled two plates and cups from the cupboard, setting the table without a word. Your stomach twisted again at the reminder that this wasn\u2019t how it used to be, but you managed to calm it with a quick internal scolding. It didn\u2019t mean, however, that you weren\u2019t still dying for Peter to sneak his arms around you from behind and rest his chin on your shoulder as you dished up your plates, or that you didn\u2019t still want to sweep all this under the rug so you could kiss him again without feeling guilty. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Y/N? Y/N, you there?\u201d</p><p>You startled, only now realizing you\u2019d been standing in the same position for who knows how long. \u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2026.sorry,\u201d you replied, shaking your head as you walked the pan to the table. </p><p>Peter was staring\u2014you could feel his eyes burning into the back of your head\u2014and when you turned to meet his gaze you saw the unspoken question of: <i>Are you okay? </i>But he never voiced it, probably knowing the answer already. He instead swallowed and cleared his throat, shoving his hands in his pockets and slightly dipping his head as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2018s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>The question was dangerous, but you were sure he knew that. Peter was too intelligent not to\u2014which also happened to be the reason you couldn\u2019t lie to him. The boy would pick up on it in an instant. But you didn\u2019t have to tell the whole truth either.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get Steve a present,\u201d you said quietly, watching as your husband\u2019s eyes lit up for a moment at the mentioning of the superhero\u2019s name then dimming again when you finished your sentence. It made your heart hurt to see Peter look so\u2026hopeless. You\u2019d only seen it once, and that was after Titan. He still struggled as did you, which was why you were back in the same bed at night, and you knew you couldn\u2019t keep this up much longer. Neither of you.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, his voice far away. \u201cYeah, Christmas is coming soon.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t answer, only took a deep breath and let it out slowly through your nose. Your hands were shaking and you felt a bit dizzy. Stumbling, you hurried to sit down and drink from the water glass Peter had gotten for you. He didn\u2019t move at the sight of you nearly collapsing into a chair, though, which made you start to worry. </p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d No reply. His eyes stared blankly at the wall, lifeless. \u201cPeter? Hey, you in there?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react, making your worry spike. You knew how bad his panic attacks could get, and while this kind wasn\u2019t as physically taxing as the kind where he felt like all he could breathe in was ash, it was equally terrifying to witness. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the apartment. You\u2019re with me. I\u2019m here. You\u2019re solid, okay?\u201d you said gently, reaching for his hand. He let you take it. \u201cPeter, I\u2019m right here-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDo you want a divorce?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Your heart stopped beating and your entire body froze. Peter tightened his hold on your now slipping hand but kept his eyes trained on the wall, and that\u2019s when you realized he hadn\u2019t been having a panic attack at all. He\u2019d just been letting that question\u2014that horrid, <i>awful </i>question\u2014bounce around his head and slowly creep to the tip of his tongue until it exited through his lips. No wonder he had looked so lifeless. </p><p>Your stomach flipped. Suddenly the stir fry didn\u2019t seem as appetizing as before. </p><p>\u201cW\u2026.what?\u201d you whispered. </p><p>Peter looked down, finally away from the wall, then up at you. He went to say something then shut his mouth, closing his eyes as if he were in pain. </p><p>You really didn\u2019t need Peter to repeat the question\u2014you really didn\u2019t <i>want </i>him to\u2014but considering you still couldn\u2019t form any other words that indicated so, you had to watch and listen as he did. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026do you want a divorce?\u201d he said again, this time a little less sure but just as seriously. </p><p>The room began to spin a little, though you weren\u2019t sure if it was because of the insane amount of pain you were in or because of the shock. Probably both. </p><p>Your heart may as well have stopped with all the beats it\u2019d skipped and still was skipping. It was cracking\u2014ripping right in half\u2014making your entire being buzz in alarm and activate a fight or flight mode you hadn\u2019t felt in a while\u2014had had no <i>reason </i>to feel. Your stomach was turning, your hands were shaking, and your mouth was dry as you somehow rounded up enough of your brain to choke out, \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t flinch at the question, which made you that much closer to retching in the nearest trash can. It was almost as if he\u2019d been <i>expecting </i>this. </p><p>Just how long had he been preparing for this?</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you said desperately, your voice cracking in the middle of it. \u201cAnswer me. <i>Please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes at your squeezing of his hand and gave your locked palms a look you couldn\u2019t quite put your finger on. There was obvious pain in his eyes as he raised them and placed a gentle kiss on the back of yours. \u201cI-I love you,\u201d he said, his voice wavering, and your heart dropped when he let go of your hand. </p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c you started, panic in your tone, but he didn\u2019t let you complete your thought. </p><p>\u201cBut this\u2014what we\u2019re doing\u2014it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s destroying us. I can\u2019t keep sitting back and watching everything we\u2019ve built crumble into\u2026\u201d Peter faltered, swallowing before going on. \u201c\u2026into dust. I think-I think that we both deserve happiness. And this isn\u2019t it. I just\u2026I know you\u2019re mad at me and I want to fix it but I can\u2019t, because I can\u2019t promise you that I\u2019ll never go on a mission again. Spider-Man means so much to me and to the people and I can\u2019t just\u2026I can\u2019t promise that.\u201d He paused, looking at you with the soft brown orbs you\u2019d fallen in love with the minute they laid eyes on you. \u201cI can promise that I love you with everything I have and that I always will, but I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>A panic you\u2019d never felt clawed at you, tearing holes in your heart and your lungs and your soul, leaving you struggling for air like a fish out of water. Only\u2014you knew how to breathe. You knew there was air to breathe. It was simple: inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, over and over and over again. It shouldn\u2019t be <i>that hard</i>. </p><p>You finally understood what Peter meant when he told you that having a panic attack was like suffocating against your own will\u2014not drowning, because there was still air, and not choking, because there were no outside forces that were responsible for it. <i>Suffocating</i>, because you physically couldn\u2019t breathe when you should be perfectly able\u2014when everyone else was perfectly able. </p><p>Inhale, exhale. It was that simple. And yet, your lungs refused to take in any of the air you were so desperate for. </p><p>Despite your immense dizziness and slightly blackened vision\u2014<i>just how long had your lungs been empty?</i>\u2014you managed to stand and make your way to the nearest trash can. </p><p>You retched. <br></p><p>\u2014</p><hr><p>Neither of you brought the topic back up, not wanting a repeat of last time. Fortunately, this meant that the \u2018D\u2019 word was never spoken again. <i>Un</i>fortunately, this also meant that there was a surplus of words that needed to be said and weren\u2019t, leading you further away from each other. You didn\u2019t even speak anymore other than to remind one another of some event or appointment you had the next day. You were running on autopilot, relying on muscle memory to get you through each day. You were sure Peter felt the same. </p><p>You and Peter ended up splitting the team up and buying gifts for whoever was in your half (you ended up buying Steve\u2019s), and while Peter got May and Happy their gifts, you got Pepper and the Barton family theirs. The Christmas decorations didn\u2019t come out, there wasn\u2019t any Christmas cookie dough in the fridge, and the Christmas tree never got picked from your favorite tree farm. No one ever came over\u2014it was always <i>to </i>the compound or <i>to </i>May\u2019s\u2014so you didn\u2019t have to worry about anyone noticing. </p><p>You still went to Sunday dinners together, and though you were never particularly hungry you ate until you were uncomfortably full on those days to make up for the diet you\u2019d had the rest of the week. You and Peter found it was easier and less awkward if you split up at dinner, putting on the fa\u00e7ade of needing to catch up with the girls and him the boys, you about any and all new developments in each one\u2019s life and Peter about the latest technology Tony had been working with. That wasn\u2019t to say the team didn\u2019t catch on\u2014after all, they <i>were </i>trained to pick up on these sort of things\u2014but they left it alone for the most part (\u2018most part\u2019 referring to the funny looks they sometimes gave one another), believing that by next week you\u2019d have it all worked out. </p><p>But then one week passed, and then the next, and then the next. </p><p>And now it was Christmas. Things were as low as you thought it could possibly get with Peter and you were dying to fix it, but every time you thought you\u2019d try you remembered how last time went and immediately lost every ounce of courage you\u2019d managed to gather. Peter sometimes did the same, late at night when you were laying in bed with nothing to say. His jaw would open then snap shut a half a second later, and you didn\u2019t have to ask any questions because you <i>knew</i>. </p><p>Peter was right: this wasn\u2019t happiness. But he <i>was </i>wrong about you being mad at him. That had long passed, replaced by anxiety and despair. You weren\u2019t mad. You actually weren\u2019t sure if you ever were. Irritated, maybe, at most. Disappointed and betrayed seemed like more appropriate words for what you\u2019d felt. But you still loved him; nothing had changed there. And Peter had openly confessed to still loving you (<i>and that he always would</i>), so you had hope. Some days the hope was hard to find, having been buried under a pile of heavy thoughts and emotions, but somehow it always worked its way back to the top, if only for a second. But a second was enough; it had to be. It had to be, or you would have been hopeless a long time ago. </p><p>\u201cIs that everything?\u201d </p><p>You nodded then frowned, looking around desperately. \u201cYeah, but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI, uh, took your purse out to the car already. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Peter said quietly, rubbing the back of his neck. Your heart clenched. </p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d You cleared your throat, quickly looking away before he could see the tears forming in your eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence. Then two. </p><p>\u201cY/N, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPete, I know where you\u2019re going,\u201d you weakly interrupted. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. We-we have to go or we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>His lips sealed shut and he agreeably nodded, then ushered you both to the car. He still held the door open for you as you clambered in and made sure you were buckled in before taking off, and you had to pretend you were really interested in whatever was outside so he wouldn\u2019t see the tears that had overflowed. You decided right then and there that being a girl had never sucked more. <i>Damn hormones. </i></p><p>You clutched your purse the entire way upstate. <br></p><p>\u2014</p><hr><p>Neither of you made a move to get out of the car when you got to the compound, neither of you ready to go through yet another day of pretending everything was fine when it was really far from it. </p><p>Peter spoke first. </p><p>\u201cBefore we go in,\u201d he said, his brows furrowed slightly and the corners of his mouth tilted down, \u201cI need to ask you something and I need you to be honest with me about it.\u201d</p><p>Your heart dropped, your mind replaying the same question he\u2019d already asked you twice with a less than favorable outcome. Peter must have dissected the look on your face, though, and rushed to fix it. </p><p>\u201cAll things aside,\u201d he quickly added, his eyes a bit wider now. \u201cI just need to ask you something that\u2019s been bothering me for a few weeks now, and I don\u2019t think I can make it through Christmas without knowing the answer.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed and held your purse tighter, but slowly nodded your agreement. Peter nodded too, then turned away to figure out how to ask what he wanted. It was a good minute before he faced you again, and the blatant concern in his eyes surprised you. </p><p>\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>You blinked. \u201cLike\u2026like with the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter shook his head, then paused and gave you a second look. \u201cBut\u2026wait, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d you said, more confused than ever. \u201cPeter, what do you mean, am I in trouble? Am I in trouble with who? With what? I don\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d he exclaimed, sighing and tugging at his curls. \u201cWith-with Spider-Man, or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, unless I somehow misread the past five years, I thought <i>you </i>were Spider-Man-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, yes, I <i>am</i>, but I\n\u2014\n\nthat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d Peter interrupted again, this time much more frustrated. He wasn\u2019t looking at you now, his head instead aimed down at his lap. Your unspoken question was in the air\u2014<i>Then, what </i>do <i>you mean?</i>\u2014but it took Peter a little bit to get around to it. \u201cYou know how I said my senses were dialed up to 11? When I told you I was Spider-Man?\u201d</p><p>Maybe if Peter didn\u2019t look so distressed you\u2019d think of a sarcastic quip to insert, something about how he thought you could forget that night, but you didn\u2019t feel up to doing that, anyway. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2026you\u2019ve been different lately,\u201d Peter started. </p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d you said less harshly but more pointedly, \u201cso have you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>You could tell your words hurt him and you regretted becoming so defensive so fast. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Peter weakly said. </p><p>You resorted to another bout of silence\u2014one full of tension. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re going to have to explain,\u201d you said eventually. </p><p>He sighed and lifted his head, staring out the windshield. \u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the same room, the hairs on the back of my neck tingle and I can just\u2026it\u2019s like I can sense something\u2019s <i>wrong </i>but I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s not exactly my spidey sense because I don\u2019t go into fight-or-flight or feel like I\u2019m in danger, it\u2019s just different because something with you is different. <i>Off. </i>You look the same but there\u2019s something off with everything else\u2014like your scent. I mean, you smell almost exactly the same so maybe I\u2019m just imagining it, and I\u2019m sure I only noticed the difference because of my spidey sense going off, but my point is-\u201d He paused to catch his breath. \u201cI just\u2026I need to know if you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d he continued, more softly than before. \u201cIf someone figured out who I am and is using you to get to me or-or something. It\u2019s been driving me insane.\u201d</p><p>Peter was wringing his fingers, something you knew he did when he felt anxious. You swallowed hard and reached over to place your hand atop his. His fingers stilled. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in trouble, Pete,\u201d you whispered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He turned to you again, searching your eyes. He must have found what he was looking for, as soon after he breathed a small sigh of relief and his shoulders dropped. \u201cOkay. Okay, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll just\u2026talk to Tony or someone about my spidey sense\u2014call this time a misfire and see if we can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Peter went on to mumble about the so-called \u2018misfire\u2019 and probable causes behind it. You couldn\u2019t make out half the words he was saying, but from what you could he seemed to be talking in circles, always landing back at square one. He seemed a bit frustrated. </p><p>You went back to holding your purse tightly to you, and an array of thoughts went through your head that subsequently caused you to take a deep breath and interrupt him. </p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d He stopped mumbling and immediately trained his eyes on you. It was only then that you realized just how dark his bags were underneath them; no, you hadn\u2019t been sleeping well either, but Peter looked like he hadn\u2019t slept in <i>days</i>. You couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it was because of his spidey sense constantly going off around you. Another breath. \u201cPeter, I think I might know why-\u201c</p><p>You never got to finish. <br></p><p>\u2014<br></p><p><b>Promises Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOnsSCSSx4ltbVhx0owm8qw\">@mintaeroandmerlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf4mejqHgKiR0ahJ7kyUSfg\">@thehollandfam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDAr46nDNjAAmQEkGhtPyOQ\">@trumpettay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLvIVEVLIwg82n_IfdMaAbw\">@ganggangganggg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msNfpXCmwE7cXPuWdI3rRcg\">@secretagentben</a> @rayanismybae* <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mikZOy8p84bvQaUHxlLRgwQ\">@yellowkenyon97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOyeBuPCE5QyG5TdPLY2Kaw\">@shewhoshallnotswear</a>\u00a0<b><br></b></p><p><b>Permanent Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjNClJexuRFTOQ9-khMdx1Q\">@my-meant-to-find-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz7ChuIQ5ZjkoQaaiqvdGkQ\">@jongindeepbreath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma08NSt4lY7lBnZYFQkaCng\">@tomspideyweb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6O5pKbczlRwnnOYxcAGtlg\">@farfromjustordinary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXjNONbv1_Gf6Cll1qAiOVA\">@tomsstarlight</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAt2oGH5Hk9qUtYI1Q2ZLIQ\">@delicately-written</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjf-SfZ0jSuN16xK4UJIPAQ\">@catstielanddeanthedog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTE3Z5FQUWRPOSjO1lXe__g\">@tom-holland-and-textposts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfYQpjtTlzRjZ1yGBhP6cHw\">@spiderman-n</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdxpq2Zc1jX6K4KSPo4CG7Q\">@wtfholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mstVju9TfY8-Hb2YYhJG-Pg\">@hollandandi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwW0mLpbQ0a-_4wahdoDxmA\">@starsholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CX9BzzOAoQyJ9IhM18kzQ\">@beautiful-holland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvLrxz0kUoxa2FH6UZRlSFw\">@spideycentral-1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@yoinksholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-gTmxeOOXe5tFoYzP76OQ\">@antifaspiderman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKyE4hPtVsqe3tlBLQFHI9w\">@trashqueenbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mylVR9EUR1f_B6fqn71tejQ\">@fireboltrose7559</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjwlOl2Xy5pvbKPhQDIpYxg\">@perhaps-he-schnapped</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_L08i7caegOXnQ7xtnIosQ\">@ofserien</a>\u00a0<b><br></b></p><p><b><i>Let me know if you want to be added!\n<i><b>\ud83d\udc95\n\n</b></i>\n\n</i></b><br></p>",

He was back at the apartment now, and while things weren&rsquo;t any worse than they were before, they certainly weren&rsquo;t any better. You tiptoed around one another, and even when you were laying in bed together, holding each other close, you could feel the barrier between you. <br /></p><p>Time seemed to be warping lately, making the days drag by yet surprise you when you see just how many of those days had passed. It had only been a couple of weeks since everything had happened, yet it felt like it should have been a couple of months. But now Christmas was right around the corner and you didn&rsquo;t have any gift shopping done. The Christmas tree wasn&rsquo;t up, no Christmas cookies were baked, the decorations were still in the office you and Peter had dubbed a storage room, and still you had no motivation to do any of it. Not without Peter. Peter was what made Christmas&hellip;well, <i>Christmas</i>. You had to do it, though. Maybe you could text Peter a few names to pick up gifts for&mdash;Tony, Bruce, Rhodey, and&hellip; Steve, perhaps. </p><p>No, not Steve. Tony? Sure. Rhodey? Why not? And Bruce? Even better. <i>But not Steve.</i> You were just as close to him as Peter was, and because of that you <i>always </i>picked out his gift together. But unless something drastically changed within a week, one of you was going to have to do it on your own. </p><p>You knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to. </p><p>Your stomach turned violently, causing you to rush to the toilet. You&rsquo;d been feeling sicker than usual the past few days now, but you&rsquo;d never actually thrown up until now. Thank goodness Peter was already at work, or he would be worried as all get out. Not to mention it&rsquo;d make talking honestly and openly impossible if Peter thought for even one second that it was him who&rsquo;d caused you to be physically ill. But he would only be half right, because you were as much a part of this as he was; you were both equally responsible. </p><p>With a still-turning stomach and a heavy heart, you stood and continued your morning routine, leaving for work ten minutes later. Work equaled distraction, and distraction equaled a blank mind&mdash;just like every other day. <br /></p><p>&mdash;</p><hr /><p>The pan sizzled as the vegetables fried inside it, and the smell surprisingly didn&rsquo;t send your stomach into another frenzy. Stir fry was safe. You made a mental note of that. </p><p>The door to the apartment opened, and your heart beat quicker at Peter&rsquo;s presence; that used to be a good thing, but now your racing pulse was for entirely different reasons. Reasons you still weren&rsquo;t brave enough to bring up. </p><p>&ldquo;It smells good,&rdquo; Peter offered with a weak smile when he came into the kitchen, his voice unsure.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you said just as unsurely, but more stiff. </p><p>Silence fell over the room, and just a few weeks ago you&rsquo;d have found it alarming (you and Peter always kept the conversation going unless something was seriously wrong), but now it was normal. It was just like every other day. </p><p>Seriously wrong had turned into normal. Funny how that worked. </p><p>While you were finishing up with the stir fry, Peter pulled two plates and cups from the cupboard, setting the table without a word. Your stomach twisted again at the reminder that this wasn&rsquo;t how it used to be, but you managed to calm it with a quick internal scolding. It didn&rsquo;t mean, however, that you weren&rsquo;t still dying for Peter to sneak his arms around you from behind and rest his chin on your shoulder as you dished up your plates, or that you didn&rsquo;t still want to sweep all this under the rug so you could kiss him again without feeling guilty. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Y/N? Y/N, you there?&rdquo;</p><p>You startled, only now realizing you&rsquo;d been standing in the same position for who knows how long. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I&hellip;.sorry,&rdquo; you replied, shaking your head as you walked the pan to the table. </p><p>Peter was staring&mdash;you could feel his eyes burning into the back of your head&mdash;and when you turned to meet his gaze you saw the unspoken question of: <i>Are you okay? </i>But he never voiced it, probably knowing the answer already. He instead swallowed and cleared his throat, shoving his hands in his pockets and slightly dipping his head as he asked, &ldquo;What&lsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;</p><p>The question was dangerous, but you were sure he knew that. Peter was too intelligent not to&mdash;which also happened to be the reason you couldn&rsquo;t lie to him. The boy would pick up on it in an instant. But you didn&rsquo;t have to tell the whole truth either.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to get Steve a present,&rdquo; you said quietly, watching as your husband&rsquo;s eyes lit up for a moment at the mentioning of the superhero&rsquo;s name then dimming again when you finished your sentence. It made your heart hurt to see Peter look so&hellip;hopeless. You&rsquo;d only seen it once, and that was after Titan. He still struggled as did you, which was why you were back in the same bed at night, and you knew you couldn&rsquo;t keep this up much longer. Neither of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Peter said, his voice far away. &ldquo;Yeah, Christmas is coming soon.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t answer, only took a deep breath and let it out slowly through your nose. Your hands were shaking and you felt a bit dizzy. Stumbling, you hurried to sit down and drink from the water glass Peter had gotten for you. He didn&rsquo;t move at the sight of you nearly collapsing into a chair, though, which made you start to worry. </p><p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; No reply. His eyes stared blankly at the wall, lifeless. &ldquo;Peter? Hey, you in there?&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t react, making your worry spike. You knew how bad his panic attacks could get, and while this kind wasn&rsquo;t as physically taxing as the kind where he felt like all he could breathe in was ash, it was equally terrifying to witness. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the apartment. You&rsquo;re with me. I&rsquo;m here. You&rsquo;re solid, okay?&rdquo; you said gently, reaching for his hand. He let you take it. &ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;m right here-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want a divorce?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence. Your heart stopped beating and your entire body froze. Peter tightened his hold on your now slipping hand but kept his eyes trained on the wall, and that&rsquo;s when you realized he hadn&rsquo;t been having a panic attack at all. He&rsquo;d just been letting that question&mdash;that horrid, <i>awful </i>question&mdash;bounce around his head and slowly creep to the tip of his tongue until it exited through his lips. No wonder he had looked so lifeless. </p><p>Your stomach flipped. Suddenly the stir fry didn&rsquo;t seem as appetizing as before. </p><p>&ldquo;W&hellip;.what?&rdquo; you whispered. </p><p>Peter looked down, finally away from the wall, then up at you. He went to say something then shut his mouth, closing his eyes as if he were in pain. </p><p>You really didn&rsquo;t need Peter to repeat the question&mdash;you really didn&rsquo;t <i>want </i>him to&mdash;but considering you still couldn&rsquo;t form any other words that indicated so, you had to watch and listen as he did. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;do you want a divorce?&rdquo; he said again, this time a little less sure but just as seriously. </p><p>The room began to spin a little, though you weren&rsquo;t sure if it was because of the insane amount of pain you were in or because of the shock. Probably both. </p><p>Your heart may as well have stopped with all the beats it&rsquo;d skipped and still was skipping. It was cracking&mdash;ripping right in half&mdash;making your entire being buzz in alarm and activate a fight or flight mode you hadn&rsquo;t felt in a while&mdash;had had no <i>reason </i>to feel. Your stomach was turning, your hands were shaking, and your mouth was dry as you somehow rounded up enough of your brain to choke out, &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t flinch at the question, which made you that much closer to retching in the nearest trash can. It was almost as if he&rsquo;d been <i>expecting </i>this. </p><p>Just how long had he been preparing for this?</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; you said desperately, your voice cracking in the middle of it. &ldquo;Answer me. <i>Please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened his eyes at your squeezing of his hand and gave your locked palms a look you couldn&rsquo;t quite put your finger on. There was obvious pain in his eyes as he raised them and placed a gentle kiss on the back of yours. &ldquo;I-I love you,&rdquo; he said, his voice wavering, and your heart dropped when he let go of your hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter-&ldquo; you started, panic in your tone, but he didn&rsquo;t let you complete your thought. </p><p>&ldquo;But this&mdash;what we&rsquo;re doing&mdash;it&rsquo;s&hellip;it&rsquo;s destroying us. I can&rsquo;t keep sitting back and watching everything we&rsquo;ve built crumble into&hellip;&rdquo; Peter faltered, swallowing before going on. &ldquo;&hellip;into dust. I think-I think that we both deserve happiness. And this isn&rsquo;t it. I just&hellip;I know you&rsquo;re mad at me and I want to fix it but I can&rsquo;t, because I can&rsquo;t promise you that I&rsquo;ll never go on a mission again. Spider-Man means so much to me and to the people and I can&rsquo;t just&hellip;I can&rsquo;t promise that.&rdquo; He paused, looking at you with the soft brown orbs you&rsquo;d fallen in love with the minute they laid eyes on you. &ldquo;I can promise that I love you with everything I have and that I always will, but I can&rsquo;t&hellip;I can&rsquo;t do this anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>A panic you&rsquo;d never felt clawed at you, tearing holes in your heart and your lungs and your soul, leaving you struggling for air like a fish out of water. Only&mdash;you knew how to breathe. You knew there was air to breathe. It was simple: inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, over and over and over again. It shouldn&rsquo;t be <i>that hard</i>. </p><p>You finally understood what Peter meant when he told you that having a panic attack was like suffocating against your own will&mdash;not drowning, because there was still air, and not choking, because there were no outside forces that were responsible for it. <i>Suffocating</i>, because you physically couldn&rsquo;t breathe when you should be perfectly able&mdash;when everyone else was perfectly able. </p><p>Inhale, exhale. It was that simple. And yet, your lungs refused to take in any of the air you were so desperate for. </p><p>Despite your immense dizziness and slightly blackened vision&mdash;<i>just how long had your lungs been empty?</i>&mdash;you managed to stand and make your way to the nearest trash can. </p><p>You retched. <br /></p><p>&mdash;</p><hr /><p>Neither of you brought the topic back up, not wanting a repeat of last time. Fortunately, this meant that the &lsquo;D&rsquo; word was never spoken again. <i>Un</i>fortunately, this also meant that there was a surplus of words that needed to be said and weren&rsquo;t, leading you further away from each other. You didn&rsquo;t even speak anymore other than to remind one another of some event or appointment you had the next day. You were running on autopilot, relying on muscle memory to get you through each day. You were sure Peter felt the same. </p><p>You and Peter ended up splitting the team up and buying gifts for whoever was in your half (you ended up buying Steve&rsquo;s), and while Peter got May and Happy their gifts, you got Pepper and the Barton family theirs. The Christmas decorations didn&rsquo;t come out, there wasn&rsquo;t any Christmas cookie dough in the fridge, and the Christmas tree never got picked from your favorite tree farm. No one ever came over&mdash;it was always <i>to </i>the compound or <i>to </i>May&rsquo;s&mdash;so you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about anyone noticing. </p><p>You still went to Sunday dinners together, and though you were never particularly hungry you ate until you were uncomfortably full on those days to make up for the diet you&rsquo;d had the rest of the week. You and Peter found it was easier and less awkward if you split up at dinner, putting on the fa&ccedil;ade of needing to catch up with the girls and him the boys, you about any and all new developments in each one&rsquo;s life and Peter about the latest technology Tony had been working with. That wasn&rsquo;t to say the team didn&rsquo;t catch on&mdash;after all, they <i>were </i>trained to pick up on these sort of things&mdash;but they left it alone for the most part (&lsquo;most part&rsquo; referring to the funny looks they sometimes gave one another), believing that by next week you&rsquo;d have it all worked out. </p><p>But then one week passed, and then the next, and then the next. </p><p>And now it was Christmas. Things were as low as you thought it could possibly get with Peter and you were dying to fix it, but every time you thought you&rsquo;d try you remembered how last time went and immediately lost every ounce of courage you&rsquo;d managed to gather. Peter sometimes did the same, late at night when you were laying in bed with nothing to say. His jaw would open then snap shut a half a second later, and you didn&rsquo;t have to ask any questions because you <i>knew</i>. </p><p>Peter was right: this wasn&rsquo;t happiness. But he <i>was </i>wrong about you being mad at him. That had long passed, replaced by anxiety and despair. You weren&rsquo;t mad. You actually weren&rsquo;t sure if you ever were. Irritated, maybe, at most. Disappointed and betrayed seemed like more appropriate words for what you&rsquo;d felt. But you still loved him; nothing had changed there. And Peter had openly confessed to still loving you (<i>and that he always would</i>), so you had hope. Some days the hope was hard to find, having been buried under a pile of heavy thoughts and emotions, but somehow it always worked its way back to the top, if only for a second. But a second was enough; it had to be. It had to be, or you would have been hopeless a long time ago. </p><p>&ldquo;Is that everything?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded then frowned, looking around desperately. &ldquo;Yeah, but-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh, took your purse out to the car already. If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; Peter said quietly, rubbing the back of his neck. Your heart clenched. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; You cleared your throat, quickly looking away before he could see the tears forming in your eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was looking for.&rdquo;</p><p>A beat of silence. Then two. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, I know where you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; you weakly interrupted. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t. We-we have to go or we&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo;</p><p>His lips sealed shut and he agreeably nodded, then ushered you both to the car. He still held the door open for you as you clambered in and made sure you were buckled in before taking off, and you had to pretend you were really interested in whatever was outside so he wouldn&rsquo;t see the tears that had overflowed. You decided right then and there that being a girl had never sucked more. <i>Damn hormones. </i></p><p>You clutched your purse the entire way upstate. <br /></p><p>&mdash;</p><hr /><p>Neither of you made a move to get out of the car when you got to the compound, neither of you ready to go through yet another day of pretending everything was fine when it was really far from it. </p><p>Peter spoke first. </p><p>&ldquo;Before we go in,&rdquo; he said, his brows furrowed slightly and the corners of his mouth tilted down, &ldquo;I need to ask you something and I need you to be honest with me about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart dropped, your mind replaying the same question he&rsquo;d already asked you twice with a less than favorable outcome. Peter must have dissected the look on your face, though, and rushed to fix it. </p><p>&ldquo;All things aside,&rdquo; he quickly added, his eyes a bit wider now. &ldquo;I just need to ask you something that&rsquo;s been bothering me for a few weeks now, and I don&rsquo;t think I can make it through Christmas without knowing the answer.&rdquo;</p><p>You swallowed and held your purse tighter, but slowly nodded your agreement. Peter nodded too, then turned away to figure out how to ask what he wanted. It was a good minute before he faced you again, and the blatant concern in his eyes surprised you. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you in trouble?&rdquo;</p><p>You blinked. &ldquo;Like&hellip;like with the law?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Peter shook his head, then paused and gave you a second look. &ldquo;But&hellip;wait, are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, of course not!&rdquo; you said, more confused than ever. &ldquo;Peter, what do you mean, am I in trouble? Am I in trouble with who? With what? I don&rsquo;t-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he exclaimed, sighing and tugging at his curls. &ldquo;With-with Spider-Man, or something!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, unless I somehow misread the past five years, I thought <i>you </i>were Spider-Man-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! I mean, yes, I <i>am</i>, but I\n&mdash;\n\nthat&rsquo;s not what I meant!&rdquo; Peter interrupted again, this time much more frustrated. He wasn&rsquo;t looking at you now, his head instead aimed down at his lap. Your unspoken question was in the air&mdash;<i>Then, what </i>do <i>you mean?</i>&mdash;but it took Peter a little bit to get around to it. &ldquo;You know how I said my senses were dialed up to 11? When I told you I was Spider-Man?&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe if Peter didn&rsquo;t look so distressed you&rsquo;d think of a sarcastic quip to insert, something about how he thought you could forget that night, but you didn&rsquo;t feel up to doing that, anyway. &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&hellip;you&rsquo;ve been different lately,&rdquo; Peter started. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well,&rdquo; you said less harshly but more pointedly, &ldquo;so have you, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>You could tell your words hurt him and you regretted becoming so defensive so fast. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;that&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; Peter weakly said. </p><p>You resorted to another bout of silence&mdash;one full of tension. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you&rsquo;re going to have to explain,&rdquo; you said eventually. </p><p>He sighed and lifted his head, staring out the windshield. &ldquo;Whenever we&rsquo;re in the same room, the hairs on the back of my neck tingle and I can just&hellip;it&rsquo;s like I can sense something&rsquo;s <i>wrong </i>but I don&rsquo;t know what it is. It&rsquo;s not exactly my spidey sense because I don&rsquo;t go into fight-or-flight or feel like I&rsquo;m in danger, it&rsquo;s just different because something with you is different. <i>Off. </i>You look the same but there&rsquo;s something off with everything else&mdash;like your scent. I mean, you smell almost exactly the same so maybe I&rsquo;m just imagining it, and I&rsquo;m sure I only noticed the difference because of my spidey sense going off, but my point is-&rdquo; He paused to catch his breath. &ldquo;I just&hellip;I need to know if you&rsquo;re in trouble.&rdquo; he continued, more softly than before. &ldquo;If someone figured out who I am and is using you to get to me or-or something. It&rsquo;s been driving me insane.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was wringing his fingers, something you knew he did when he felt anxious. You swallowed hard and reached over to place your hand atop his. His fingers stilled. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in trouble, Pete,&rdquo; you whispered. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned to you again, searching your eyes. He must have found what he was looking for, as soon after he breathed a small sigh of relief and his shoulders dropped. &ldquo;Okay. Okay, that&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;ll just&hellip;talk to Tony or someone about my spidey sense&mdash;call this time a misfire and see if we can figure it out.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter went on to mumble about the so-called &lsquo;misfire&rsquo; and probable causes behind it. You couldn&rsquo;t make out half the words he was saying, but from what you could he seemed to be talking in circles, always landing back at square one. He seemed a bit frustrated. </p><p>You went back to holding your purse tightly to you, and an array of thoughts went through your head that subsequently caused you to take a deep breath and interrupt him. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; He stopped mumbling and immediately trained his eyes on you. It was only then that you realized just how dark his bags were underneath them; no, you hadn&rsquo;t been sleeping well either, but Peter looked like he hadn&rsquo;t slept in <i>days</i>. You couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if it was because of his spidey sense constantly going off around you. Another breath. &ldquo;Peter, I think I might know why-&ldquo;</p><p>You never got to finish. <br /></p><p>&mdash;<br /></p><p><b>Promises Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOnsSCSSx4ltbVhx0owm8qw\">@mintaeroandmerlin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf4mejqHgKiR0ahJ7kyUSfg\">@thehollandfam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDAr46nDNjAAmQEkGhtPyOQ\">@trumpettay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLvIVEVLIwg82n_IfdMaAbw\">@ganggangganggg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msNfpXCmwE7cXPuWdI3rRcg\">@secretagentben</a> @rayanismybae* <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mikZOy8p84bvQaUHxlLRgwQ\">@yellowkenyon97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOyeBuPCE5QyG5TdPLY2Kaw\">@shewhoshallnotswear</a>&nbsp;<b><br /></b></p><p><b>Permanent Tag List: </b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjNClJexuRFTOQ9-khMdx1Q\">@my-meant-to-find-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz7ChuIQ5ZjkoQaaiqvdGkQ\">@jongindeepbreath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma08NSt4lY7lBnZYFQkaCng\">@tomspideyweb</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6O5pKbczlRwnnOYxcAGtlg\">@farfromjustordinary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXjNONbv1_Gf6Cll1qAiOVA\">@tomsstarlight</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAt2oGH5Hk9qUtYI1Q2ZLIQ\">@delicately-written</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjf-SfZ0jSuN16xK4UJIPAQ\">@catstielanddeanthedog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTE3Z5FQUWRPOSjO1lXe__g\">@tom-holland-and-textposts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfYQpjtTlzRjZ1yGBhP6cHw\">@spiderman-n</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdxpq2Zc1jX6K4KSPo4CG7Q\">@wtfholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mstVju9TfY8-Hb2YYhJG-Pg\">@hollandandi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwW0mLpbQ0a-_4wahdoDxmA\">@starsholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CX9BzzOAoQyJ9IhM18kzQ\">@beautiful-holland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvLrxz0kUoxa2FH6UZRlSFw\">@spideycentral-1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@yoinksholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msJEccU4T6ZCmOuyFZbZYUg\">@casuallytumblingdownthestairs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVuRgRYHxyK3mO6opUA1pPg\">@smexylemony</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg-gTmxeOOXe5tFoYzP76OQ\">@antifaspiderman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKyE4hPtVsqe3tlBLQFHI9w\">@trashqueenbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mylVR9EUR1f_B6fqn71tejQ\">@fireboltrose7559</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjwlOl2Xy5pvbKPhQDIpYxg\">@perhaps-he-schnapped</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_L08i7caegOXnQ7xtnIosQ\">@ofserien</a>&nbsp;<b><br /></b></p><p><b><i>Let me know if you want to be added!\n<i><b>&#128149;\n\n</b></i>\n\n</i></b><br /></p>",

\u00a0He was about to open his mouth to ask, but\nPeter suddenly stood up and held a hand out for Tony to take.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Peter\nsaid. \u00a0\u201cI want to take you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Tony took Peter\u2019s\nhand and followed him out of the restaurant. \nThey walked for a while in comfortable silence, and then Tony realised\nhe hadn\u2019t thanked Peter for the meal. \u00a0<i>Idiot</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for\nthe meal, baby,\u201d Tony said, wrapping an arm around Peter\u2019s waist as they\nwalked. \u00a0It was cold out, and Peter leaned\ninto Tony\u2019s touch. </p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d\nPeter asked, glancing up at Tony with a curious look in his soft brown eyes.</p><p>Tony held Peter\ncloser to him and smiled. \u00a0\u201cI loved it.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile grew,\nand with that Tony stopped, stepping in front of Peter and wrapping his other\narm around the younger man\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you\nstopping?\u201d Peter asked, shivering slightly at the cold. \u00a0It was just beginning to snow, and Tony couldn\u2019t\nask for better timing if he tried.</p><p>\u201cYou smiled and I-\u201d\nTony started, lifting a hand up to caress Peter\u2019s cheek softly. \u00a0\u201c-I needed to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Peter only smiled\nmore. \u00a0\u201cSo what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Tony closed the gap\nbetween them with a slow, tender kiss. \nPeter sighed contently against Tony\u2019s lips and pushed himself closer to\nTony, wrapping both his arms around his neck. \nTony deepened the kiss, wishing it could last forever. \u00a0This moment was perfect. \u00a0God, he loved Peter \u2013 more than\nanything. \u00a0Their bodies were pressed\ntogether, fingers tangled in each other\u2019s hair, lips crashing together now in a\ndesperate need to feel only each other.</p><p>When they\neventually broke apart for air, they stayed only inches apart, foreheads\npressed together. \u00a0Peter exhaled, the\ncold making his breath visible between them. \nThey stared at each other, getting lost in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Marry me,\u201d Peter\nwhispered, not taking his eyes off Tony\u2019s. \n\u201cPlease, <i>please</i> marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- for real?\u201d Tony\nasked, holding onto Peter more tightly. \nHe couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. \nHe really hadn\u2019t expected that. \u00a0Was\nPeter really proposing to him? \u00a0It\nfit. \u00a0The fancy restaurant, Valentine\u2019s\nDay, the nervousness\u2026 </p><p>\u201cFor real, I- I got\nyou a ring, um, hold on,\u201d Peter stammered, releasing one of his hands from\naround Tony\u2019s neck and fumbling around in his jacket pocket for something. \u00a0He brought his other hand down and then\ncarefully got down on one knee. \u00a0\u201cLet me\ndo this right, okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked down at\nhim, but he couldn\u2019t find the words. \u00a0He\nnodded, unable to keep the smile from his face.</p><p>Peter shakily brought\nthe box up and opened it, revealing a beautiful ring that was exactly to Tony\u2019s\ntaste. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t too over-the-top, not\ngirly, not even too plain. \u00a0It was just <i>perfect</i>, and it definitely wasn\u2019t\ncheap. \u00a0Tony knew a lot about jewellery,\nand this was the real deal.</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019re the\nbest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. \nYou make me smile when I\u2019m feeling at my worst, and you make me laugh\nwhen I just want to curl up and cry. \u00a0You\nbring light to my life, and you make me happy to be alive. \u00a0I, uh, well\u2026 I actually had a whole speech\nprepared and I\u2019ve totally forgotten it so\u2026 there goes that,\u201d Peter said, laughing\nnervously. Tony brought his hands out to steady Peter\u2019s shaky hands. \u00a0\u201cBut what I\u2019m really trying to ask you is\u2026\nwell\u2026 Tony Stark, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>For a split second,\nTony thought he\u2019d mess with Peter and say something stupid, but the look in\nPeter\u2019s eyes made it impossible. \u00a0How\ncould he say anything other than \u2018yes\u2019 to the pure, beautiful angel that was\nkneeling before him asking him to be his forever? \u00a0Tony grinned down at him. \u00a0\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?!\u201d Peter\nasked, getting up quickly, looking utterly relieved. </p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Tony\nrepeated, holding his hand out expectantly.</p><p>Peter made an\nexcited sound and pulled the ring out of the box, slowly sliding it onto Tony\u2019s\nleft ring-finger.</p><p>\u201cIt suits you,\u201d\nPeter said, admiring the ring on Tony\u2019s hand and then staring up at his face\nwith adoration. \u201cWe\u2019re getting <i>married</i>!\u201d</p><p>Tony pulled Peter\ncloser and kissed the top of his forehead. \n\u201cHow\u2019d you afford all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been saving\nfor years,\u201d Peter said quietly, resting his head against Tony\u2019s chest. \u00a0\u201cAll the money I could save, I put it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\ndo this-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Tony, I know\nthat,\u201d Peter said, holding onto him tighter. \n\u201cBut I <i>wanted</i> to.\u201d</p><p>Tony kissed the top\nof his head. \u00a0\u201cI love you, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d\nPeter said with a smile. \u00a0</p><p>And so, Valentine\u2019s\nDay was now Tony\u2019s favourite holiday.</p>",

\u00a0He was about to open his mouth to ask, but\nPeter suddenly stood up and held a hand out for Tony to take.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Peter\nsaid. \u00a0\u201cI want to take you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Tony took Peter\u2019s\nhand and followed him out of the restaurant. \nThey walked for a while in comfortable silence, and then Tony realised\nhe hadn\u2019t thanked Peter for the meal. \u00a0<i>Idiot</i>, he berated himself.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for\nthe meal, baby,\u201d Tony said, wrapping an arm around Peter\u2019s waist as they\nwalked. \u00a0It was cold out, and Peter leaned\ninto Tony\u2019s touch. </p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d\nPeter asked, glancing up at Tony with a curious look in his soft brown eyes.</p><p>Tony held Peter\ncloser to him and smiled. \u00a0\u201cI loved it.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile grew,\nand with that Tony stopped, stepping in front of Peter and wrapping his other\narm around the younger man\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you\nstopping?\u201d Peter asked, shivering slightly at the cold. \u00a0It was just beginning to snow, and Tony couldn\u2019t\nask for better timing if he tried.</p><p>\u201cYou smiled and I-\u201d\nTony started, lifting a hand up to caress Peter\u2019s cheek softly. \u00a0\u201c-I needed to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Peter only smiled\nmore. \u00a0\u201cSo what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Tony closed the gap\nbetween them with a slow, tender kiss. \nPeter sighed contently against Tony\u2019s lips and pushed himself closer to\nTony, wrapping both his arms around his neck. \nTony deepened the kiss, wishing it could last forever. \u00a0This moment was perfect. \u00a0God, he loved Peter \u2013 more than\nanything. \u00a0Their bodies were pressed\ntogether, fingers tangled in each other\u2019s hair, lips crashing together now in a\ndesperate need to feel only each other.</p><p>When they\neventually broke apart for air, they stayed only inches apart, foreheads\npressed together. \u00a0Peter exhaled, the\ncold making his breath visible between them. \nThey stared at each other, getting lost in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Marry me,\u201d Peter\nwhispered, not taking his eyes off Tony\u2019s. \n\u201cPlease, <i>please</i> marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- for real?\u201d Tony\nasked, holding onto Peter more tightly. \nHe couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. \nHe really hadn\u2019t expected that. \u00a0Was\nPeter really proposing to him? \u00a0It\nfit. \u00a0The fancy restaurant, Valentine\u2019s\nDay, the nervousness\u2026 </p><p>\u201cFor real, I- I got\nyou a ring, um, hold on,\u201d Peter stammered, releasing one of his hands from\naround Tony\u2019s neck and fumbling around in his jacket pocket for something. \u00a0He brought his other hand down and then\ncarefully got down on one knee. \u00a0\u201cLet me\ndo this right, okay?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked down at\nhim, but he couldn\u2019t find the words. \u00a0He\nnodded, unable to keep the smile from his face.</p><p>Peter shakily brought\nthe box up and opened it, revealing a beautiful ring that was exactly to Tony\u2019s\ntaste. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t too over-the-top, not\ngirly, not even too plain. \u00a0It was just <i>perfect</i>, and it definitely wasn\u2019t\ncheap. \u00a0Tony knew a lot about jewellery,\nand this was the real deal.</p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019re the\nbest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. \nYou make me smile when I\u2019m feeling at my worst, and you make me laugh\nwhen I just want to curl up and cry. \u00a0You\nbring light to my life, and you make me happy to be alive. \u00a0I, uh, well\u2026 I actually had a whole speech\nprepared and I\u2019ve totally forgotten it so\u2026 there goes that,\u201d Peter said, laughing\nnervously. Tony brought his hands out to steady Peter\u2019s shaky hands. \u00a0\u201cBut what I\u2019m really trying to ask you is\u2026\nwell\u2026 Tony Stark, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>For a split second,\nTony thought he\u2019d mess with Peter and say something stupid, but the look in\nPeter\u2019s eyes made it impossible. \u00a0How\ncould he say anything other than \u2018yes\u2019 to the pure, beautiful angel that was\nkneeling before him asking him to be his forever? \u00a0Tony grinned down at him. \u00a0\u201cOf course I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?!\u201d Peter\nasked, getting up quickly, looking utterly relieved. </p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Tony\nrepeated, holding his hand out expectantly.</p><p>Peter made an\nexcited sound and pulled the ring out of the box, slowly sliding it onto Tony\u2019s\nleft ring-finger.</p><p>\u201cIt suits you,\u201d\nPeter said, admiring the ring on Tony\u2019s hand and then staring up at his face\nwith adoration. \u201cWe\u2019re getting <i>married</i>!\u201d</p><p>Tony pulled Peter\ncloser and kissed the top of his forehead. \n\u201cHow\u2019d you afford all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been saving\nfor years,\u201d Peter said quietly, resting his head against Tony\u2019s chest. \u00a0\u201cAll the money I could save, I put it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\ndo this-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-Tony, I know\nthat,\u201d Peter said, holding onto him tighter. \n\u201cBut I <i>wanted</i> to.\u201d</p><p>Tony kissed the top\nof his head. \u00a0\u201cI love you, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d\nPeter said with a smile. \u00a0</p><p>And so, Valentine\u2019s\nDay was now Tony\u2019s favourite holiday.</p>",

Well, more nervous than usual. This was the day he waited for such a long time. He was dressed in his best shirt and pants, holding a bouquet of red roses. His fingers were hurting from gripping too hard on the thorns and his lip felt sore from bitting it to hard. Even though Peter didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable he didn&rsquo;t care. It was very special day for him. He had been planning it for months. Everything was supposed to be perfect. </p><p>He was going to ask you out. </p><p>It was Valentine&rsquo;s day and he finally got the guts to do it. He planned to ask Mr Start to drive him to school this day in one of his new cars to impress you. He wanted to buy the best suit, rent a orchestra to play love songs and buy the biggest flower bouquet of them all. He was willing to spend all his money just to give you the best impression of himself on this special day. </p><p>It didn&rsquo;t work out though. Mr Stark wasn&rsquo;t answering his phone (probably being too busy planning his own date with Pepper or building another Iron Man suit), all the orchestras have been rented a year ago, he couldn&rsquo;t affor a decent suit, and the florist had only one miserable bouquet left. It was a total disaster and Peter knew it. The wort thing was he couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. Sure, he could have just show up in his Spiderman suit but then how would he know you really liked him? </p><p>&lsquo;Just be yourself, Pete. She&rsquo;ll like you&rsquo; Aunt May advised him while he was standing in front of the mirror trying to convince himself it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. It was easy to say for a adult woman.

Well, more nervous than usual. This was the day he waited for such a long time. He was dressed in his best shirt and pants, holding a bouquet of red roses. His fingers were hurting from gripping too hard on the thorns and his lip felt sore from bitting it to hard. Even though Peter didn\u2019t feel comfortable he didn\u2019t care.

He planned to ask Mr Start to drive him to school this day in one of his new cars to impress you. He wanted to buy the best suit, rent a orchestra to play love songs and buy the biggest flower bouquet of them all. He was willing to spend all his money just to give you the best impression of himself on this special day. </p><p>It didn\u2019t work out though. Mr Stark wasn\u2019t answering his phone (probably being too busy planning his own date with Pepper or building another Iron Man suit), all the orchestras have been rented a year ago, he couldn\u2019t affor a decent suit, and the florist had only one miserable bouquet left. It was a total disaster and Peter knew it. The wort thing was he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.

You wanted it to be perfect, especially since he was home a lot more now. </p><p>Getting reservations at one of the nicest restaurants in London was a struggle but you pulled the \u2018this is for Tom Holland\u2019 card. You even went so far as to get a new red dress to wear. You only hoped it didn\u2019t go unnoticed. </p><p>You and Tom were sitting at the table, eyes scanning over the menu, when Tom\u2019s phone buzzed on the table. You scowled as he picked it up to see who it was. A toothy grin appeared on his face and you had no doubt it was from Harrison. </p><p>He typed back a reply and you hoped he would leave it at that but as he kept tapping at the screen, you knew it was a groupchat. </p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d You started, trying to get his attention. \u201cAre we going to order or at least have a meaningful conversation?\u201d You asked him. \u201cHm? Yeah, babe, get whatever you want.\u201d Tom replied, still looking at his phone. </p><p>At that point, the anger and annoyance you felt was practically radiating off of you. You clenched your jaw as the waiter came around and you had it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we had a family emergency come up and have to leave.\u201d You lied. </p><p>And Tom didn\u2019t even notice you were planning on leaving. Once the waiter left the table, you grabbed your purse and your coat and stood up, putting on your coat. </p><p>\u201cWait, what are you doing?\u201d Tom asked, finally looking up from his phone. \u201cOh so now you notice? Well, since you\u2019re enjoying your conversation a lot more than this dinner I planned for us, you can spend Valentine\u2019s Day with Harrison and Jacob.\u201d You replied before stomping out of the restaurant. </p><p>Tom sat there for a couple of minutes before standing up to follow after you. \u201cBabe, wait!\u201d He called as he was trying to catch up with you. But once you got into the Uber you ordered, he was too late. </p><p>**</p><p>You arrived home and took your heels off by the door. Planning that dinner for you and Tom took way more work than he probably thought. </p><p>Walking into the kitchen, you saw Tessa lying on the couch, unbothered by your presence. Grabbing a bottle of champagne from the wine rack, you popped open the top of it not even bothering to use a glass. </p><p>\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day to me.\u201d You mutter before taking a big swig from the bottle. You heard the front door open and rolled your eyes knowing it was Tom. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He called. Tom turned the corner into the kitchen and saw you standing there, leaning against the counter, with a bottle of champagne in your hand. </p><p>He finally got a good look at your appearance and he wanted to say you looked beautiful but he didn\u2019t think that moment was the right time. \u201cCan we talk about why you\u2019re mad?\u201d Tom asked you. </p><p>\u201cSo now you want to talk to me. You want to talk about why I\u2019m mad? Well, Tom, I\u2019m mad because I put so much effort into planning out the perfect Valentine\u2019s Day dinner for us and you think a stupid groupchat is more important than that.\u201d You snapped. </p><p>\u201cIt was just dinner, love, we still have the rest of the night.\u201d Tom said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just dinner! I got us a reservation at one of the best restaurants in London! Do you know how difficult that was? I bought a brand new dress for you! Hell, I even bought new lingerie to try to make this night special but you couldn\u2019t care less!\u201d You yelled, waving your hands around with the bottle still in your grasp. </p><p>That part started to make Tom nervous because he didn\u2019t want you to accidentally break the bottle and hurt yourself. </p><p>\u201cGod, Tom, you could have put in a little effort into this night. But instead, you decided that Harrison and Jacob were more important.\u201d You added, slamming the bottle onto the counter. </p><p>When you did, the bottom of the bottle shattered and glass fell onto the ground and champagne spilled everywhere. </p><p>\u201cShit, Y/N.\u201d Tom muttered walking towards you. \u201cI got it.\u201d You told him, holding your hand in front of you, signaling for him to stay back. You got onto your knees to begin to pick up the glass. \u201cY/N, let me help you before you cut yourself.\u201d Tom said. </p><p>You ignored him and continued to pick up the glass.\u00a0\u201cY/N,\u201d Tom started.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d You snapped back, looking up at him. When you weren\u2019t looking at him, it just seemed as if you were angry but once you made eye contact with him, he saw your makeup was smudged and your cheeks were stained with tears. If he wasn\u2019t guilty before, he was when he saw you had been crying.</p><p>Tom knew you weren\u2019t one to cry over just a normal dinner or to cry over any other day. So you crying because of that, means that it was important to you.\u00a0</p><p>When you knew Tom wasn\u2019t going to say anything, you scoffed and returned your focus back to the glass. But the tears made your vision blurry and as you picked up a larger piece, it cut the middle of your palm.\u00a0</p><p>You hissed in pain and dropped the piece of glass quickly. You stood up and reached for paper towels when you felt Tom\u2019s hand on your waist. Blood was dripping down you arm as you tried to make the bleeding stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you okay?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You muttered.\u00a0\u201cNo you\u2019re not. You can go back to being mad at me after we\u2019ve cleaned this up.\u201d Tom told you, a sternness in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>The rational part of you knew he was right, so you let him take your hand and run it under the warm water. You sat on the edge of the counter, as Tom went back and forth between your hand and the first aid kit.</p><p>You watched as he tended to your injuries and your eyes couldn\u2019t help but water. You just wanted the night to be perfect and it\u2019s all gone to hell.\u00a0</p><p>A tear fell onto your lap, catching Tom\u2019s attention. He looked up at you, only to have you lift your head up and look at the ceiling.\u00a0\u201cLove, can you just talk to me without yelling?\u201d He asked, using his thumb to wipe the tear off your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe last two years for Valentine\u2019s Day, we were never able to spend the day together. We couldn\u2019t do anything special for each other and I just wanted this year to be different. But then we were at dinner and you were sitting on your phone talking to Harrison and you weren\u2019t even paying attention to me. It may have seemed like just another dinner to you but to me it was supposed to be amazing.\u201d You said sniffling at the end of your rant.\u00a0</p><p>Tom closed his eyes tightly as he was still working on your hand.\u00a0\u201cI am so sorry, Y/N. I don\u2019t have an excuse for acting like an ass.\u201d Tom said, his own eyes beginning to water.\u00a0</p><p>When he had finished wrapping up your hand, he continued to hold it, both of your hands resting on your lap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made it seem as if I didn\u2019t appreciate what you did tonight. I love you so much, Y/N and I appreciate everything you do for me. Putting up with me and Harrison when we\u2019re watching football. Or when I\u2019m too lazy to take Tessa out and you offer to do it. Or when you\u2019re just being you.\u201d He added.\u00a0</p><p>You looked up at him when he placed a hand on your cheek.\u00a0\u201cI love you too, Tom.\u201d You said quietly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll make this up to you, I promise.\u201d Tom said quickly.\u00a0\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m probably just overreacting. I think i\u2019m probably going to head to bed.\u201d You told him as you got down from the counter. You were just tired of fighting with him and wanted it to be over.</p><p>\u201cOkay, babe. I\u2019ll clean this up and I\u2019ll be right up.\u201d Tom told you.You gave him a sad smile before placing a gentle kiss on his cheek.\u00a0</p><p>When you left the room, Tom ran his hands through his hair and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid.\u201d He said to himself.</p><p>He never wanted to make you feel less important than you were. The truth was, he had something planned that he was going to do at home but he got so caught up texting Harrison and Jacob about it, he forgot he was at dinner. Grabbing a broom and dust pan, Tom dialed Harrison\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d He answered. \u201cI am so beyond mad at you right now.\u201d Tom said to his best friend. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Harrison asked. \u201cBecause you kept texting me at dinner, Y/N is pissed at me. Me texting you back made her feel as if I didn\u2019t care about the night she planned.\u201d Tom explained. \u201cShit. So you didn\u2019t ask her?\u201d Harrison questioned. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t ask her. But i\u2019m going to do it tomorrow. That\u2019s why I need your help.\u201d Tom said. \u201cOkay, what can I do?\u201d Harrison replied. </p><p>You got into the room and changed into your pajamas, before climbing into bed. Soon after, Tessa walked into the room as well. \u201cHey, Tess.\u201d You said to the dog as she climbed up on the bed and curled up next to you. Quickly, your eyes began to feel heavy and you fell asleep.</p><p>** </p><p>The next morning, you awoke to an empty bed, except for Tessa. You didn\u2019t even feel Tom come to bed the night before so you began to get worried. You removed the comforter and climbed out of bed to go see where Tom was. </p><p>Walking down the stairs, you heard music playing softly from the kitchen. You stepped into the room and saw Tom standing shirtless at the stove making waffles. \u201cTom, what are you doing?\u201d You asked with a small chuckle. </p><p>He turned around and gave you a big smile. \u201cGood morning, love. I wanted to make you breakfast and make up for ruining our night.\u201d He told you. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Really, I\u2019m over it.\u201d You said. \u201cBut i\u2019m not. I never want to make you feel less important than you are. Because you\u2019re the most important person in my life.\u201d Tom retorted. You couldn\u2019t say anything when Tom left the kitchen and walked into the living room. </p><p>When he returned, he had a black box full of flowers and he set them down on the table, before pulling the chair out for you. </p><p>You sat down in front of the flowers and grabbed the card from the top. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you are the love of my life and the best person I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. I couldn\u2019t imagine living my life without you. I\u2019m so sorry for messing up the evening you had planned for us and I\u2019m going to make sure I make it up to you.\u201d You read out loud. </p><p>You quickly wiped the tear that fell from your eyes, though they were happy tears. \u201cWhich is why I have something to ask you.\u201d You continued. You looked to your left where Tom was and saw him down on one knee with a black box in his hands. </p><p>With wide eyes, you set the card down and looked at Tom. \u201cThe card says it all, love. So, what do you say? Will you marry me?\u201d He asked. </p><p>At first, you physically couldn\u2019t form your response so you had to stick with nodding your head rapidly. Tom smiled up at you as he took the ring from the box and slid it on to your finger.</p><p>You practically tackled Tom to the floor when you threw your arms around him. \u201cI love you. I love you so much.\u201d You said into the crook of his neck. \u201cAnd I love you, Y/N. I always will.\u201d Tom said, kissing the top of your head.</p><p>February 14th was supposed to be a memorable day for the both of you but February 15th quickly became your favorite day. </p>",

You only hoped it didn\u2019t go unnoticed. </p><p>You and Tom were sitting at the table, eyes scanning over the menu, when Tom\u2019s phone buzzed on the table. You scowled as he picked it up to see who it was. A toothy grin appeared on his face and you had no doubt it was from Harrison. </p><p>He typed back a reply and you hoped he would leave it at that but as he kept tapping at the screen, you knew it was a groupchat. </p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d You started, trying to get his attention. \u201cAre we going to order or at least have a meaningful conversation?\u201d You asked him. \u201cHm? Yeah, babe, get whatever you want.\u201d Tom replied, still looking at his phone. </p><p>At that point, the anger and annoyance you felt was practically radiating off of you. You clenched your jaw as the waiter came around and you had it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we had a family emergency come up and have to leave.\u201d You lied. </p><p>And Tom didn\u2019t even notice you were planning on leaving. Once the waiter left the table, you grabbed your purse and your coat and stood up, putting on your coat. </p><p>\u201cWait, what are you doing?\u201d Tom asked, finally looking up from his phone. \u201cOh so now you notice? Well, since you\u2019re enjoying your conversation a lot more than this dinner I planned for us, you can spend Valentine\u2019s Day with Harrison and Jacob.\u201d You replied before stomping out of the restaurant. </p><p>Tom sat there for a couple of minutes before standing up to follow after you. \u201cBabe, wait!\u201d He called as he was trying to catch up with you. But once you got into the Uber you ordered, he was too late. </p><p>**</p><p>You arrived home and took your heels off by the door. Planning that dinner for you and Tom took way more work than he probably thought. </p><p>Walking into the kitchen, you saw Tessa lying on the couch, unbothered by your presence. Grabbing a bottle of champagne from the wine rack, you popped open the top of it not even bothering to use a glass. </p><p>\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day to me.\u201d You mutter before taking a big swig from the bottle. You heard the front door open and rolled your eyes knowing it was Tom. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He called. Tom turned the corner into the kitchen and saw you standing there, leaning against the counter, with a bottle of champagne in your hand. </p><p>He finally got a good look at your appearance and he wanted to say you looked beautiful but he didn\u2019t think that moment was the right time. \u201cCan we talk about why you\u2019re mad?\u201d Tom asked you. </p><p>\u201cSo now you want to talk to me. You want to talk about why I\u2019m mad? Well, Tom, I\u2019m mad because I put so much effort into planning out the perfect Valentine\u2019s Day dinner for us and you think a stupid groupchat is more important than that.\u201d You snapped. </p><p>\u201cIt was just dinner, love, we still have the rest of the night.\u201d Tom said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just dinner! I got us a reservation at one of the best restaurants in London! Do you know how difficult that was? I bought a brand new dress for you! Hell, I even bought new lingerie to try to make this night special but you couldn\u2019t care less!\u201d You yelled, waving your hands around with the bottle still in your grasp. </p><p>That part started to make Tom nervous because he didn\u2019t want you to accidentally break the bottle and hurt yourself. </p><p>\u201cGod, Tom, you could have put in a little effort into this night. But instead, you decided that Harrison and Jacob were more important.\u201d You added, slamming the bottle onto the counter. </p><p>When you did, the bottom of the bottle shattered and glass fell onto the ground and champagne spilled everywhere. </p><p>\u201cShit, Y/N.\u201d Tom muttered walking towards you. \u201cI got it.\u201d You told him, holding your hand in front of you, signaling for him to stay back. You got onto your knees to begin to pick up the glass. \u201cY/N, let me help you before you cut yourself.\u201d Tom said. </p><p>You ignored him and continued to pick up the glass.\u00a0\u201cY/N,\u201d Tom started.\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d You snapped back, looking up at him. When you weren\u2019t looking at him, it just seemed as if you were angry but once you made eye contact with him, he saw your makeup was smudged and your cheeks were stained with tears. If he wasn\u2019t guilty before, he was when he saw you had been crying.</p><p>Tom knew you weren\u2019t one to cry over just a normal dinner or to cry over any other day. So you crying because of that, means that it was important to you.\u00a0</p><p>When you knew Tom wasn\u2019t going to say anything, you scoffed and returned your focus back to the glass. But the tears made your vision blurry and as you picked up a larger piece, it cut the middle of your palm.\u00a0</p><p>You hissed in pain and dropped the piece of glass quickly. You stood up and reached for paper towels when you felt Tom\u2019s hand on your waist. Blood was dripping down you arm as you tried to make the bleeding stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you okay?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You muttered.\u00a0\u201cNo you\u2019re not. You can go back to being mad at me after we\u2019ve cleaned this up.\u201d Tom told you, a sternness in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>The rational part of you knew he was right, so you let him take your hand and run it under the warm water. You sat on the edge of the counter, as Tom went back and forth between your hand and the first aid kit.</p><p>You watched as he tended to your injuries and your eyes couldn\u2019t help but water. You just wanted the night to be perfect and it\u2019s all gone to hell.\u00a0</p><p>A tear fell onto your lap, catching Tom\u2019s attention. He looked up at you, only to have you lift your head up and look at the ceiling.\u00a0\u201cLove, can you just talk to me without yelling?\u201d He asked, using his thumb to wipe the tear off your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe last two years for Valentine\u2019s Day, we were never able to spend the day together. We couldn\u2019t do anything special for each other and I just wanted this year to be different. But then we were at dinner and you were sitting on your phone talking to Harrison and you weren\u2019t even paying attention to me. It may have seemed like just another dinner to you but to me it was supposed to be amazing.\u201d You said sniffling at the end of your rant.\u00a0</p><p>Tom closed his eyes tightly as he was still working on your hand.\u00a0\u201cI am so sorry, Y/N. I don\u2019t have an excuse for acting like an ass.\u201d Tom said, his own eyes beginning to water.\u00a0</p><p>When he had finished wrapping up your hand, he continued to hold it, both of your hands resting on your lap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made it seem as if I didn\u2019t appreciate what you did tonight. I love you so much, Y/N and I appreciate everything you do for me. Putting up with me and Harrison when we\u2019re watching football. Or when I\u2019m too lazy to take Tessa out and you offer to do it. Or when you\u2019re just being you.\u201d He added.\u00a0</p><p>You looked up at him when he placed a hand on your cheek.\u00a0\u201cI love you too, Tom.\u201d You said quietly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll make this up to you, I promise.\u201d Tom said quickly.\u00a0\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m probably just overreacting. I think i\u2019m probably going to head to bed.\u201d You told him as you got down from the counter. You were just tired of fighting with him and wanted it to be over.</p><p>\u201cOkay, babe. I\u2019ll clean this up and I\u2019ll be right up.\u201d Tom told you.You gave him a sad smile before placing a gentle kiss on his cheek.\u00a0</p><p>When you left the room, Tom ran his hands through his hair and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid.\u201d He said to himself.</p><p>He never wanted to make you feel less important than you were. The truth was, he had something planned that he was going to do at home but he got so caught up texting Harrison and Jacob about it, he forgot he was at dinner. Grabbing a broom and dust pan, Tom dialed Harrison\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d He answered. \u201cI am so beyond mad at you right now.\u201d Tom said to his best friend. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Harrison asked. \u201cBecause you kept texting me at dinner, Y/N is pissed at me. Me texting you back made her feel as if I didn\u2019t care about the night she planned.\u201d Tom explained. \u201cShit. So you didn\u2019t ask her?\u201d Harrison questioned. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t ask her. But i\u2019m going to do it tomorrow. That\u2019s why I need your help.\u201d Tom said. \u201cOkay, what can I do?\u201d Harrison replied. </p><p>You got into the room and changed into your pajamas, before climbing into bed. Soon after, Tessa walked into the room as well. \u201cHey, Tess.\u201d You said to the dog as she climbed up on the bed and curled up next to you. Quickly, your eyes began to feel heavy and you fell asleep.</p><p>** </p><p>The next morning, you awoke to an empty bed, except for Tessa. You didn\u2019t even feel Tom come to bed the night before so you began to get worried. You removed the comforter and climbed out of bed to go see where Tom was. </p><p>Walking down the stairs, you heard music playing softly from the kitchen. You stepped into the room and saw Tom standing shirtless at the stove making waffles. \u201cTom, what are you doing?\u201d You asked with a small chuckle. </p><p>He turned around and gave you a big smile. \u201cGood morning, love. I wanted to make you breakfast and make up for ruining our night.\u201d He told you. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Really, I\u2019m over it.\u201d You said. \u201cBut i\u2019m not. I never want to make you feel less important than you are. Because you\u2019re the most important person in my life.\u201d Tom retorted. You couldn\u2019t say anything when Tom left the kitchen and walked into the living room. </p><p>When he returned, he had a black box full of flowers and he set them down on the table, before pulling the chair out for you. </p><p>You sat down in front of the flowers and grabbed the card from the top. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you are the love of my life and the best person I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. I couldn\u2019t imagine living my life without you. I\u2019m so sorry for messing up the evening you had planned for us and I\u2019m going to make sure I make it up to you.\u201d You read out loud. </p><p>You quickly wiped the tear that fell from your eyes, though they were happy tears. \u201cWhich is why I have something to ask you.\u201d You continued. You looked to your left where Tom was and saw him down on one knee with a black box in his hands. </p><p>With wide eyes, you set the card down and looked at Tom. \u201cThe card says it all, love. So, what do you say? Will you marry me?\u201d He asked. </p><p>At first, you physically couldn\u2019t form your response so you had to stick with nodding your head rapidly. Tom smiled up at you as he took the ring from the box and slid it on to your finger.</p><p>You practically tackled Tom to the floor when you threw your arms around him. \u201cI love you. I love you so much.\u201d You said into the crook of his neck. \u201cAnd I love you, Y/N. I always will.\u201d Tom said, kissing the top of your head.</p><p>February 14th was supposed to be a memorable day for the both of you but February 15th quickly became your favorite day. </p></p>",

Me texting you back made her feel as if I didn\u2019t care about the night she planned.\u201d Tom explained. \u201cShit. So you didn\u2019t ask her?\u201d Harrison questioned. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t ask her. But i\u2019m going to do it tomorrow. That\u2019s why I need your help.\u201d Tom said. \u201cOkay, what can I do?\u201d Harrison replied. </p><p>You got into the room and changed into your pajamas, before climbing into bed. Soon after, Tessa walked into the room as well. \u201cHey, Tess.\u201d You said to the dog as she climbed up on the bed and curled up next to you. Quickly, your eyes began to feel heavy and you fell asleep.</p><p>** </p><p>The next morning, you awoke to an empty bed, except for Tessa. You didn\u2019t even feel Tom come to bed the night before so you began to get worried. You removed the comforter and climbed out of bed to go see where Tom was. </p><p>Walking down the stairs, you heard music playing softly from the kitchen. You stepped into the room and saw Tom standing shirtless at the stove making waffles. \u201cTom, what are you doing?\u201d You asked with a small chuckle. </p><p>He turned around and gave you a big smile. \u201cGood morning, love. I wanted to make you breakfast and make up for ruining our night.\u201d He told you. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Really, I\u2019m over it.\u201d You said. \u201cBut i\u2019m not. I never want to make you feel less important than you are. Because you\u2019re the most important person in my life.\u201d Tom retorted. You couldn\u2019t say anything when Tom left the kitchen and walked into the living room. </p><p>When he returned, he had a black box full of flowers and he set them down on the table, before pulling the chair out for you. </p><p>You sat down in front of the flowers and grabbed the card from the top. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you are the love of my life and the best person I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. I couldn\u2019t imagine living my life without you. I\u2019m so sorry for messing up the evening you had planned for us and I\u2019m going to make sure I make it up to you.\u201d You read out loud. </p><p>You quickly wiped the tear that fell from your eyes, though they were happy tears. \u201cWhich is why I have something to ask you.\u201d You continued. You looked to your left where Tom was and saw him down on one knee with a black box in his hands. </p><p>With wide eyes, you set the card down and looked at Tom. \u201cThe card says it all, love. So, what do you say? Will you marry me?\u201d He asked. </p><p>At first, you physically couldn\u2019t form your response so you had to stick with nodding your head rapidly. Tom smiled up at you as he took the ring from the box and slid it on to your finger.</p><p>You practically tackled Tom to the floor when you threw your arms around him. \u201cI love you. I love you so much.\u201d You said into the crook of his neck. \u201cAnd I love you, Y/N. I always will.\u201d Tom said, kissing the top of your head.</p><p>February 14th was supposed to be a memorable day for the both of you but February 15th quickly became your favorite day. </p></p>",

You wanted it to be perfect, especially since he was home a lot more now. </p><p>Getting reservations at one of the nicest restaurants in London was a struggle but you pulled the &lsquo;this is for Tom Holland&rsquo; card. You even went so far as to get a new red dress to wear. You only hoped it didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. </p><p>You and Tom were sitting at the table, eyes scanning over the menu, when Tom&rsquo;s phone buzzed on the table. You scowled as he picked it up to see who it was. A toothy grin appeared on his face and you had no doubt it was from Harrison. </p><p>He typed back a reply and you hoped he would leave it at that but as he kept tapping at the screen, you knew it was a groupchat. </p><p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; You started, trying to get his attention. &ldquo;Are we going to order or at least have a meaningful conversation?&rdquo; You asked him. &ldquo;Hm? Yeah, babe, get whatever you want.&rdquo; Tom replied, still looking at his phone. </p><p>At that point, the anger and annoyance you felt was practically radiating off of you. You clenched your jaw as the waiter came around and you had it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but we had a family emergency come up and have to leave.&rdquo; You lied. </p><p>And Tom didn&rsquo;t even notice you were planning on leaving. Once the waiter left the table, you grabbed your purse and your coat and stood up, putting on your coat. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what are you doing?&rdquo; Tom asked, finally looking up from his phone. &ldquo;Oh so now you notice? Well, since you&rsquo;re enjoying your conversation a lot more than this dinner I planned for us, you can spend Valentine&rsquo;s Day with Harrison and Jacob.&rdquo; You replied before stomping out of the restaurant. </p><p>Tom sat there for a couple of minutes before standing up to follow after you. &ldquo;Babe, wait!&rdquo; He called as he was trying to catch up with you. But once you got into the Uber you ordered, he was too late. </p><p>**</p><p>You arrived home and took your heels off by the door. Planning that dinner for you and Tom took way more work than he probably thought. </p><p>Walking into the kitchen, you saw Tessa lying on the couch, unbothered by your presence. Grabbing a bottle of champagne from the wine rack, you popped open the top of it not even bothering to use a glass. </p><p>&ldquo;Happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day to me.&rdquo; You mutter before taking a big swig from the bottle. You heard the front door open and rolled your eyes knowing it was Tom. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; He called. Tom turned the corner into the kitchen and saw you standing there, leaning against the counter, with a bottle of champagne in your hand. </p><p>He finally got a good look at your appearance and he wanted to say you looked beautiful but he didn&rsquo;t think that moment was the right time. &ldquo;Can we talk about why you&rsquo;re mad?&rdquo; Tom asked you. </p><p>&ldquo;So now you want to talk to me. You want to talk about why I&rsquo;m mad? Well, Tom, I&rsquo;m mad because I put so much effort into planning out the perfect Valentine&rsquo;s Day dinner for us and you think a stupid groupchat is more important than that.&rdquo; You snapped. </p><p>&ldquo;It was just dinner, love, we still have the rest of the night.&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just dinner! I got us a reservation at one of the best restaurants in London! Do you know how difficult that was? I bought a brand new dress for you! Hell, I even bought new lingerie to try to make this night special but you couldn&rsquo;t care less!&rdquo; You yelled, waving your hands around with the bottle still in your grasp. </p><p>That part started to make Tom nervous because he didn&rsquo;t want you to accidentally break the bottle and hurt yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;God, Tom, you could have put in a little effort into this night. But instead, you decided that Harrison and Jacob were more important.&rdquo; You added, slamming the bottle onto the counter. </p><p>When you did, the bottom of the bottle shattered and glass fell onto the ground and champagne spilled everywhere. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit, Y/N.&rdquo; Tom muttered walking towards you. &ldquo;I got it.&rdquo; You told him, holding your hand in front of you, signaling for him to stay back. You got onto your knees to begin to pick up the glass. &ldquo;Y/N, let me help you before you cut yourself.&rdquo; Tom said. </p><p>You ignored him and continued to pick up the glass.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; Tom started.&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You snapped back, looking up at him. When you weren&rsquo;t looking at him, it just seemed as if you were angry but once you made eye contact with him, he saw your makeup was smudged and your cheeks were stained with tears. If he wasn&rsquo;t guilty before, he was when he saw you had been crying.</p><p>Tom knew you weren&rsquo;t one to cry over just a normal dinner or to cry over any other day. So you crying because of that, means that it was important to you.&nbsp;</p><p>When you knew Tom wasn&rsquo;t going to say anything, you scoffed and returned your focus back to the glass. But the tears made your vision blurry and as you picked up a larger piece, it cut the middle of your palm.&nbsp;</p><p>You hissed in pain and dropped the piece of glass quickly. You stood up and reached for paper towels when you felt Tom&rsquo;s hand on your waist. Blood was dripping down you arm as you tried to make the bleeding stop.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, are you okay?&rdquo; He asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; You muttered.&nbsp;&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not. You can go back to being mad at me after we&rsquo;ve cleaned this up.&rdquo; Tom told you, a sternness in his voice.&nbsp;</p><p>The rational part of you knew he was right, so you let him take your hand and run it under the warm water. You sat on the edge of the counter, as Tom went back and forth between your hand and the first aid kit.</p><p>You watched as he tended to your injuries and your eyes couldn&rsquo;t help but water. You just wanted the night to be perfect and it&rsquo;s all gone to hell.&nbsp;</p><p>A tear fell onto your lap, catching Tom&rsquo;s attention. He looked up at you, only to have you lift your head up and look at the ceiling.&nbsp;&ldquo;Love, can you just talk to me without yelling?&rdquo; He asked, using his thumb to wipe the tear off your cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The last two years for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, we were never able to spend the day together. We couldn&rsquo;t do anything special for each other and I just wanted this year to be different. But then we were at dinner and you were sitting on your phone talking to Harrison and you weren&rsquo;t even paying attention to me. It may have seemed like just another dinner to you but to me it was supposed to be amazing.&rdquo; You said sniffling at the end of your rant.&nbsp;</p><p>Tom closed his eyes tightly as he was still working on your hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am so sorry, Y/N. I don&rsquo;t have an excuse for acting like an ass.&rdquo; Tom said, his own eyes beginning to water.&nbsp;</p><p>When he had finished wrapping up your hand, he continued to hold it, both of your hands resting on your lap.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I made it seem as if I didn&rsquo;t appreciate what you did tonight. I love you so much, Y/N and I appreciate everything you do for me. Putting up with me and Harrison when we&rsquo;re watching football. Or when I&rsquo;m too lazy to take Tessa out and you offer to do it. Or when you&rsquo;re just being you.&rdquo; He added.&nbsp;</p><p>You looked up at him when he placed a hand on your cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you too, Tom.&rdquo; You said quietly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make this up to you, I promise.&rdquo; Tom said quickly.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m probably just overreacting. I think i&rsquo;m probably going to head to bed.&rdquo; You told him as you got down from the counter. You were just tired of fighting with him and wanted it to be over.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, babe. I&rsquo;ll clean this up and I&rsquo;ll be right up.&rdquo; Tom told you.You gave him a sad smile before placing a gentle kiss on his cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>When you left the room, Tom ran his hands through his hair and sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stupid.&rdquo; He said to himself.</p><p>He never wanted to make you feel less important than you were. The truth was, he had something planned that he was going to do at home but he got so caught up texting Harrison and Jacob about it, he forgot he was at dinner.
