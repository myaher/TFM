And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br/></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2.6k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing </p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/44497957\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil rubs the inside of his eyes with his fingers and lets out a long, drawn out sigh.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Phil.\u201d Dan says, his voice gentle on the other end of the line. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with Marianne and she\u2019s working on getting all stories surrounding us pulled from news sites and TV news.

Spike whimpered on his lap and he ran his hands through his fur to calm him down. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is actually unbelievable!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I just got word that I\u2019ve been casted as Christopher Robin in a new live-action adaptation of Winnie the Pooh!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his stomach fall to the ground. He doesn\u2019t know why, but the news of that causes his stomach to knot even more. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I literally\u2015Oh my fucking god, this could not have come at a better timing! I needed something like this today. You have no idea. I auditioned for this role like four months ago and they gave me a call back and I went and I thought I totally fucked my chances but oh my God.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad that everything worked out.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI hope it all works out for us too\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out, Phil.\u201d Dan says, his voice wavering a bit over the speaker. \u201cTogether.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPromise?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPromise.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m going to draft my statement and then have it be approved by Marianne. I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m about to post it but if I were you, I\u2019d delete social media for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe said his goodbye\u2019s to Dan not long after. Dan was coming to London soon anyway and hopefully when they\u2019re together, they can get this figured out a bit more than it is right now. Because right now, Phil is feeling like this is going to be a disaster in waiting.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019d spoken to his mum about it some more but it didn\u2019t end up helping in the long run when his mum just kept telling him they should hire him someone who can help. Phil didn\u2019t want that. He just wanted the drama to be fixed. He wanted to be left alone but right now, he can\u2019t even go to the park without being noticed.\u00a0</p><p>\tIn his wildest dreams, he has thought about living a life like this. But for Phil, this life was because he was a famous YouTuber, not a famous movie star. However, after being around Dan for as long as he has, he\u2019s realized pretty quickly he doesn\u2019t want this.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t turn the TV back on that night, nor does he even pick up his laptop. He\u2019s running behind on his assignments for the BBC and it\u2019s quite sad for him to feel like he doesn\u2019t even care. He doesn\u2019t care if his assignments are late. He doesn\u2019t care he if even finishes them at all.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe just wants to be left alone.\u00a0</p><p>\tSometime that night, his doorbell goes off. It scares him half to death but he climbs up from the couch and makes his way over, peering out the peephole. His brother is stood on the other side, holding a large pizza box in his hand.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens the door slowly and steps aside so Martyn can come in. \u201cMum rung me like an other ago. She wanted me to make sure you\u2019re okay so I brought some pizza from Dominos since I know you like to eat that when you\u2019re stressed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his lips curl into a smile. \u201cWhat kind did you get?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Martyn says, walking past Phil to set the pizza down on his breakfast bar. \u201cDominos got rid of the sizzler so I ended up just getting pepperoni.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens the box and is immediately salivating over the smell of greasy pizza and plastic cheese. He didn\u2019t even realize he hadn\u2019t ate the entire day until he was suddenly reaching for a slice and nearly inhaling it down in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Martyn says. \u201cBrother to brother. Friend to friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan and I officially began our relationship when I was in the US.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, that\u2019s brilliant!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, yeah, but it\u2019s also not.\u201d Phil says. \u201cBecause paparazzi are following us everywhere and we literally cannot go anywhere without be ambushed. Just this afternoon, I was met with a pap in the park with Spike, taking photos of me and yelling after me to tell him about Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Martyn asked, taking a bite of his slice.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to them.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI just ran off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDid you tell Dan about it?\u201d Martyn presses. \u201cMum said she told you to contact him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI talked to him this afternoon.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd what did Dan say about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s working with his own team to clear everything up.\u201d Phil says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter because nothing will change.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what you signed up for when you began to pursue Dan?\u201d Martyn pressed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t start acting like mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not meaning to.\u201d Martyn paused and Phil looked at his brother. \u201cI just mean that you clearly decided that you wanted to be Dan so isn\u2019t it not all that shocking that all of this is happening? Like, Dan\u2019s name has been the source of headlines all over the world for the past three years.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Phil says. He set\u2019s down his pizza slice onto his plate and pushes it aside. He doesn\u2019t feel hungry anymore, just sick and a bit greasy. \u201cBut Dan isn\u2019t like that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s not that typical celebrity figure that everyone thinks he is. He hates being in the tabloids and he actively hides to try and get away. You should have seen how much he panicked even going out to get food. He normally gets his manager to pick him up something instead and bring it to his house. He also wears sunglasses and hoodies in public to try and hide but they always notice him. We went into a restaurant for a few moments and every person was staring at him. It made him so uncomfortable that he left and told me to order his food for him.\u201d Phil feels winded when he\u2019s done speaking. \u201cDo you know what any of what I said means?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMartyn nods, but doesn\u2019t say anything right away.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil picks up his slice of pizza and takes another bite, willing himself to keep it down despite his body protesting a bit. Martyn continues to eat in silence as well and the tension in the air is pulled tight like a rubber band about to snap. Spike comes over sometime in the middle of this silence and Phil bends down and hands him a tiny bite of the pizza.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re really smitten with Dan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up at Martyn. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou seem to know so much about him and care about him more than you\u2019ve cared about anyone else in a while. You\u2019re quick to defend him and to state his story. You\u2019re really gone for him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushes because everything that Martyn says in true. \u201cI know I am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre we going to have a new Lester in the family one day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and refuses to answer. Martyn lets out a laugh and Phil chuckles as well. The tension in his stomach unknots and he feels a lot better now about everything. He finishes off two more slices of pizza and then he and Martyn watch some anime on his TV.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>I posted the statement</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Marianne checked to make sure I didn\u2019t have any typos\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil wakes up to those messages on his phone screen. It takes him a moment to adjust to being awake, grabbing his glasses in the meantime. He puts them on and reads the screen again and feels his heart pick up pace a little bit.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sees that Dan sent him a screenshot of his tweet with the statement and he looks it over, reading it carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t say this enough but I wanted to make it clear that I would like for my private life to remain private. It is hard to maintain a balance between being in public and also being in my private time. I ask that my privacy be respected in these times and I ask that news stations consult with me before running anything about me or the people I\u2019m associated with. If my private life continues to be a source of news for many people, I will consider taking legal action. Thank you, Daniel\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what to think reading it over. Should he have a reaction?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil throws his phone to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets up slowly and let\u2019s Spike out for a bathroom break before he takes a shower and get\u2019s ready for work.\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the BBC, he keeps to himself the entire day. He doesn\u2019t speak even with PJ. He finds it easier to just work on what he needs to and then leave at the time he\u2019s supposed to.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he leaves the BBC after work is over, he\u2019s met with paparazzi outside the building. Phil should have known that would happen. He keeps his head low and he fights his way through them until he reaches the other side and makes a beeline for his tube station.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe stops and picks up food at the Sainsbury\u2019s across the street from his flat and when he gets back to his flat, he lays down on his couch with Spike and cuddles him. His phone has a few messages on it from PJ, his mum, and a few from Dan. But he can\u2019t bring himself up to actually answering any of them. He finds himself in a funk of not wanting to go through all of this.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens his laptop up a few hours later. On his screen is a little window saying that his video was done exporting\u2015the assumptions video that he filmed with Dan in LA. Dan told him that his publicist told him not to post the video, but something inside of himself tells him to post it anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\tBeside him, his phone begins to vibrate for a phone call and he looks down and sees Dan\u2019s photo pop up the screen. It\u2019s a photo Phil took of Dan in LA, when they were lying in bed one night. He looked so angelic, so peaceful. But yet, the smile on his voice showed happiness like Phil has never seen before.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe picks up his phone and answers it, putting it on speaker.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered me all day,\u201d Dan says, his voice wavering a bit. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cGoing to be honest, not really.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI kind of figured,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m not either.\u201d Dan pauses and silence fills the room once again. \u201cI just wanted us to be able to have a normal relationship, ya know? Going on dates, having cute little adventures.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe still can.\u201d Phil says, feeling his voice waver and his eyes water. \u201cI want to have all of that with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s run away together.\u201d Dan says, his voice light. \u201cLet\u2019s just go off the radar and live together on some remote island.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly, do not tempt me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe could live in a little beach cottage with Spike and we could grow our own food and live off the land.\u201d Dan continues. \u201cJust you and me, forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI love the sound of that.\u201d Phil says, shutting his laptop and turning onto his side.</p><p>\t\u201cOf what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust you and me forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe can almost hear Dan\u2019s smile through the speaker. \u201cOne day it will be.\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut for right now. We just have to make it past all of this. We just have to keep fighting the tabloids and the paparazzi. You and I can do it. We\u2019ll get past all of this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know we will.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRemember what we promised each other when we were in LA?\u201d Dan asks, his voice having gone soft. \u201cWe promised that we\u2019d never give up on each other.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI still promise that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe too.\u201d Dan agrees. \u201cWhich is why I just wanted to remind you that we can do it. We can overcome all of this together.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have you here with me again.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hold you in my arms and never let you go.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust two more weeks. Two more weeks and I\u2019ll be here for a film premiere.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either, but we have to.\u201d Dan says, a chuckle ending his words. \u201cI also can\u2019t wait to see Spike.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the mentions of his name, Spike\u2019s head perks up and he lets out a surprised yelp. Phil chuckles and Dan does too.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey talk for the rest of the night, just him and Dan. They talk about the future, and how they both want to eventually live somewhere secluded in a house with a fence around it. Dan wanted a dog for Spike to play with and they somehow came to the agreement about a Shiba Inu. Before the night was over, they were discussing kids. And although that thought would always scare Phil before, talking with Dan about how many kids they both wanted with oddly comforting.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Dan hung up because he needed to get ready for a party, Phil was nearly falling asleep. But he wouldn\u2019t have had his evening any other way. He just has to make it these two more weeks and hopefully everything can get figured out.\u00a0</p>",

He can\u2019t help but have doubts.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHopefully.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI know what you feel though\u2026I\u2019m pretty upset by all of this too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe should have expected it.\u201d Phil says and he\u2019s not sure who he\u2019s even saying it to: Dan or himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course but that doesn\u2019t make it easier.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan sighs. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest, Phil. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to every possible person on my side and the only thing we can do at this point is release some statements or try and keep quiet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFuck.\u201d Dan exclaimed, followed by the sound of something heavy falling in the background. \u201cOh my god!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan?\u201d Phil asked, his voice suddenly rising. Spike whimpered on his lap and he ran his hands through his fur to calm him down. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is actually unbelievable!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I just got word that I\u2019ve been casted as Christopher Robin in a new live-action adaptation of Winnie the Pooh!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his stomach fall to the ground. He doesn\u2019t know why, but the news of that causes his stomach to knot even more. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I literally\u2015Oh my fucking god, this could not have come at a better timing! I needed something like this today. You have no idea. I auditioned for this role like four months ago and they gave me a call back and I went and I thought I totally fucked my chances but oh my God.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad that everything worked out.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI hope it all works out for us too\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out, Phil.\u201d Dan says, his voice wavering a bit over the speaker. \u201cTogether.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPromise?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPromise.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m going to draft my statement and then have it be approved by Marianne. I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m about to post it but if I were you, I\u2019d delete social media for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe said his goodbye\u2019s to Dan not long after. Dan was coming to London soon anyway and hopefully when they\u2019re together, they can get this figured out a bit more than it is right now. Because right now, Phil is feeling like this is going to be a disaster in waiting.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019d spoken to his mum about it some more but it didn\u2019t end up helping in the long run when his mum just kept telling him they should hire him someone who can help. Phil didn\u2019t want that. He just wanted the drama to be fixed. He wanted to be left alone but right now, he can\u2019t even go to the park without being noticed.\u00a0</p><p>\tIn his wildest dreams, he has thought about living a life like this. But for Phil, this life was because he was a famous YouTuber, not a famous movie star. However, after being around Dan for as long as he has, he\u2019s realized pretty quickly he doesn\u2019t want this.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t turn the TV back on that night, nor does he even pick up his laptop. He\u2019s running behind on his assignments for the BBC and it\u2019s quite sad for him to feel like he doesn\u2019t even care. He doesn\u2019t care if his assignments are late. He doesn\u2019t care he if even finishes them at all.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe just wants to be left alone.\u00a0</p><p>\tSometime that night, his doorbell goes off. It scares him half to death but he climbs up from the couch and makes his way over, peering out the peephole. His brother is stood on the other side, holding a large pizza box in his hand.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens the door slowly and steps aside so Martyn can come in. \u201cMum rung me like an other ago. She wanted me to make sure you\u2019re okay so I brought some pizza from Dominos since I know you like to eat that when you\u2019re stressed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his lips curl into a smile. \u201cWhat kind did you get?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Martyn says, walking past Phil to set the pizza down on his breakfast bar. \u201cDominos got rid of the sizzler so I ended up just getting pepperoni.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens the box and is immediately salivating over the smell of greasy pizza and plastic cheese. He didn\u2019t even realize he hadn\u2019t ate the entire day until he was suddenly reaching for a slice and nearly inhaling it down in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Martyn says. \u201cBrother to brother. Friend to friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan and I officially began our relationship when I was in the US.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, that\u2019s brilliant!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, yeah, but it\u2019s also not.\u201d Phil says. \u201cBecause paparazzi are following us everywhere and we literally cannot go anywhere without be ambushed. Just this afternoon, I was met with a pap in the park with Spike, taking photos of me and yelling after me to tell him about Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Martyn asked, taking a bite of his slice.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to them.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI just ran off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDid you tell Dan about it?\u201d Martyn presses. \u201cMum said she told you to contact him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI talked to him this afternoon.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd what did Dan say about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s working with his own team to clear everything up.\u201d Phil says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter because nothing will change.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what you signed up for when you began to pursue Dan?\u201d Martyn pressed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t start acting like mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not meaning to.\u201d Martyn paused and Phil looked at his brother. \u201cI just mean that you clearly decided that you wanted to be Dan so isn\u2019t it not all that shocking that all of this is happening? Like, Dan\u2019s name has been the source of headlines all over the world for the past three years.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Phil says. He set\u2019s down his pizza slice onto his plate and pushes it aside. He doesn\u2019t feel hungry anymore, just sick and a bit greasy. \u201cBut Dan isn\u2019t like that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s not that typical celebrity figure that everyone thinks he is. He hates being in the tabloids and he actively hides to try and get away. You should have seen how much he panicked even going out to get food. He normally gets his manager to pick him up something instead and bring it to his house. He also wears sunglasses and hoodies in public to try and hide but they always notice him. We went into a restaurant for a few moments and every person was staring at him. It made him so uncomfortable that he left and told me to order his food for him.\u201d Phil feels winded when he\u2019s done speaking. \u201cDo you know what any of what I said means?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMartyn nods, but doesn\u2019t say anything right away.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil picks up his slice of pizza and takes another bite, willing himself to keep it down despite his body protesting a bit. Martyn continues to eat in silence as well and the tension in the air is pulled tight like a rubber band about to snap. Spike comes over sometime in the middle of this silence and Phil bends down and hands him a tiny bite of the pizza.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re really smitten with Dan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up at Martyn. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou seem to know so much about him and care about him more than you\u2019ve cared about anyone else in a while. You\u2019re quick to defend him and to state his story. You\u2019re really gone for him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushes because everything that Martyn says in true. \u201cI know I am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre we going to have a new Lester in the family one day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and refuses to answer. Martyn lets out a laugh and Phil chuckles as well. The tension in his stomach unknots and he feels a lot better now about everything. He finishes off two more slices of pizza and then he and Martyn watch some anime on his TV.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>I posted the statement</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Marianne checked to make sure I didn\u2019t have any typos\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil wakes up to those messages on his phone screen. It takes him a moment to adjust to being awake, grabbing his glasses in the meantime. He puts them on and reads the screen again and feels his heart pick up pace a little bit.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sees that Dan sent him a screenshot of his tweet with the statement and he looks it over, reading it carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t say this enough but I wanted to make it clear that I would like for my private life to remain private. It is hard to maintain a balance between being in public and also being in my private time. I ask that my privacy be respected in these times and I ask that news stations consult with me before running anything about me or the people I\u2019m associated with. If my private life continues to be a source of news for many people, I will consider taking legal action. Thank you, Daniel\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what to think reading it over. Should he have a reaction?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil throws his phone to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets up slowly and let\u2019s Spike out for a bathroom break before he takes a shower and get\u2019s ready for work.\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the BBC, he keeps to himself the entire day. He doesn\u2019t speak even with PJ. He finds it easier to just work on what he needs to and then leave at the time he\u2019s supposed to.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he leaves the BBC after work is over, he\u2019s met with paparazzi outside the building. Phil should have known that would happen. He keeps his head low and he fights his way through them until he reaches the other side and makes a beeline for his tube station.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe stops and picks up food at the Sainsbury\u2019s across the street from his flat and when he gets back to his flat, he lays down on his couch with Spike and cuddles him. His phone has a few messages on it from PJ, his mum, and a few from Dan. But he can\u2019t bring himself up to actually answering any of them. He finds himself in a funk of not wanting to go through all of this.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens his laptop up a few hours later. On his screen is a little window saying that his video was done exporting\u2015the assumptions video that he filmed with Dan in LA. Dan told him that his publicist told him not to post the video, but something inside of himself tells him to post it anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\tBeside him, his phone begins to vibrate for a phone call and he looks down and sees Dan\u2019s photo pop up the screen. It\u2019s a photo Phil took of Dan in LA, when they were lying in bed one night. He looked so angelic, so peaceful. But yet, the smile on his voice showed happiness like Phil has never seen before.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe picks up his phone and answers it, putting it on speaker.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered me all day,\u201d Dan says, his voice wavering a bit. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cGoing to be honest, not really.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI kind of figured,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m not either.\u201d Dan pauses and silence fills the room once again. \u201cI just wanted us to be able to have a normal relationship, ya know? Going on dates, having cute little adventures.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe still can.\u201d Phil says, feeling his voice waver and his eyes water. \u201cI want to have all of that with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s run away together.\u201d Dan says, his voice light. \u201cLet\u2019s just go off the radar and live together on some remote island.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly, do not tempt me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe could live in a little beach cottage with Spike and we could grow our own food and live off the land.\u201d Dan continues. \u201cJust you and me, forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI love the sound of that.\u201d Phil says, shutting his laptop and turning onto his side.</p><p>\t\u201cOf what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust you and me forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe can almost hear Dan\u2019s smile through the speaker. \u201cOne day it will be.\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut for right now. We just have to make it past all of this. We just have to keep fighting the tabloids and the paparazzi. You and I can do it. We\u2019ll get past all of this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know we will.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRemember what we promised each other when we were in LA?\u201d Dan asks, his voice having gone soft. \u201cWe promised that we\u2019d never give up on each other.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI still promise that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe too.\u201d Dan agrees. \u201cWhich is why I just wanted to remind you that we can do it. We can overcome all of this together.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have you here with me again.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hold you in my arms and never let you go.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust two more weeks. Two more weeks and I\u2019ll be here for a film premiere.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either, but we have to.\u201d Dan says, a chuckle ending his words. \u201cI also can\u2019t wait to see Spike.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the mentions of his name, Spike\u2019s head perks up and he lets out a surprised yelp. Phil chuckles and Dan does too.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey talk for the rest of the night, just him and Dan. They talk about the future, and how they both want to eventually live somewhere secluded in a house with a fence around it. Dan wanted a dog for Spike to play with and they somehow came to the agreement about a Shiba Inu. Before the night was over, they were discussing kids. And although that thought would always scare Phil before, talking with Dan about how many kids they both wanted with oddly comforting.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Dan hung up because he needed to get ready for a party, Phil was nearly falling asleep. But he wouldn\u2019t have had his evening any other way. He just has to make it these two more weeks and hopefully everything can get figured out.\u00a0</p>",

He can\u2019t help but have doubts.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHopefully.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI know what you feel though\u2026I\u2019m pretty upset by all of this too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe should have expected it.\u201d Phil says and he\u2019s not sure who he\u2019s even saying it to: Dan or himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course but that doesn\u2019t make it easier.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan sighs. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest, Phil. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to every possible person on my side and the only thing we can do at this point is release some statements or try and keep quiet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFuck.\u201d Dan exclaimed, followed by the sound of something heavy falling in the background. \u201cOh my god!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan?\u201d Phil asked, his voice suddenly rising. Spike whimpered on his lap and he ran his hands through his fur to calm him down. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is actually unbelievable!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I just got word that I\u2019ve been casted as Christopher Robin in a new live-action adaptation of Winnie the Pooh!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his stomach fall to the ground. He doesn\u2019t know why, but the news of that causes his stomach to knot even more. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, I literally\u2015Oh my fucking god, this could not have come at a better timing! I needed something like this today. You have no idea. I auditioned for this role like four months ago and they gave me a call back and I went and I thought I totally fucked my chances but oh my God.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad that everything worked out.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI hope it all works out for us too\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out, Phil.\u201d Dan says, his voice wavering a bit over the speaker. \u201cTogether.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPromise?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPromise.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m going to draft my statement and then have it be approved by Marianne. I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m about to post it but if I were you, I\u2019d delete social media for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded his head.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe said his goodbye\u2019s to Dan not long after. Dan was coming to London soon anyway and hopefully when they\u2019re together, they can get this figured out a bit more than it is right now. Because right now, Phil is feeling like this is going to be a disaster in waiting.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019d spoken to his mum about it some more but it didn\u2019t end up helping in the long run when his mum just kept telling him they should hire him someone who can help. Phil didn\u2019t want that. He just wanted the drama to be fixed. He wanted to be left alone but right now, he can\u2019t even go to the park without being noticed.\u00a0</p><p>\tIn his wildest dreams, he has thought about living a life like this. But for Phil, this life was because he was a famous YouTuber, not a famous movie star. However, after being around Dan for as long as he has, he\u2019s realized pretty quickly he doesn\u2019t want this.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t turn the TV back on that night, nor does he even pick up his laptop. He\u2019s running behind on his assignments for the BBC and it\u2019s quite sad for him to feel like he doesn\u2019t even care. He doesn\u2019t care if his assignments are late. He doesn\u2019t care he if even finishes them at all.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe just wants to be left alone.\u00a0</p><p>\tSometime that night, his doorbell goes off. It scares him half to death but he climbs up from the couch and makes his way over, peering out the peephole. His brother is stood on the other side, holding a large pizza box in his hand.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens the door slowly and steps aside so Martyn can come in. \u201cMum rung me like an other ago. She wanted me to make sure you\u2019re okay so I brought some pizza from Dominos since I know you like to eat that when you\u2019re stressed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his lips curl into a smile. \u201cWhat kind did you get?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell,\u201d Martyn says, walking past Phil to set the pizza down on his breakfast bar. \u201cDominos got rid of the sizzler so I ended up just getting pepperoni.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens the box and is immediately salivating over the smell of greasy pizza and plastic cheese. He didn\u2019t even realize he hadn\u2019t ate the entire day until he was suddenly reaching for a slice and nearly inhaling it down in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Martyn says. \u201cBrother to brother. Friend to friend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan and I officially began our relationship when I was in the US.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, that\u2019s brilliant!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, yeah, but it\u2019s also not.\u201d Phil says. \u201cBecause paparazzi are following us everywhere and we literally cannot go anywhere without be ambushed. Just this afternoon, I was met with a pap in the park with Spike, taking photos of me and yelling after me to tell him about Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Martyn asked, taking a bite of his slice.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to them.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI just ran off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDid you tell Dan about it?\u201d Martyn presses. \u201cMum said she told you to contact him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI talked to him this afternoon.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd what did Dan say about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s working with his own team to clear everything up.\u201d Phil says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter because nothing will change.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut isn\u2019t that what you signed up for when you began to pursue Dan?\u201d Martyn pressed.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t start acting like mum.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not meaning to.\u201d Martyn paused and Phil looked at his brother. \u201cI just mean that you clearly decided that you wanted to be Dan so isn\u2019t it not all that shocking that all of this is happening? Like, Dan\u2019s name has been the source of headlines all over the world for the past three years.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Phil says. He set\u2019s down his pizza slice onto his plate and pushes it aside. He doesn\u2019t feel hungry anymore, just sick and a bit greasy. \u201cBut Dan isn\u2019t like that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s not that typical celebrity figure that everyone thinks he is. He hates being in the tabloids and he actively hides to try and get away. You should have seen how much he panicked even going out to get food. He normally gets his manager to pick him up something instead and bring it to his house. He also wears sunglasses and hoodies in public to try and hide but they always notice him. We went into a restaurant for a few moments and every person was staring at him. It made him so uncomfortable that he left and told me to order his food for him.\u201d Phil feels winded when he\u2019s done speaking. \u201cDo you know what any of what I said means?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMartyn nods, but doesn\u2019t say anything right away.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil picks up his slice of pizza and takes another bite, willing himself to keep it down despite his body protesting a bit. Martyn continues to eat in silence as well and the tension in the air is pulled tight like a rubber band about to snap. Spike comes over sometime in the middle of this silence and Phil bends down and hands him a tiny bite of the pizza.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re really smitten with Dan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looks up at Martyn. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou seem to know so much about him and care about him more than you\u2019ve cared about anyone else in a while. You\u2019re quick to defend him and to state his story. You\u2019re really gone for him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil blushes because everything that Martyn says in true. \u201cI know I am.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre we going to have a new Lester in the family one day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and refuses to answer. Martyn lets out a laugh and Phil chuckles as well. The tension in his stomach unknots and he feels a lot better now about everything. He finishes off two more slices of pizza and then he and Martyn watch some anime on his TV.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>I posted the statement</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Marianne checked to make sure I didn\u2019t have any typos\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil wakes up to those messages on his phone screen. It takes him a moment to adjust to being awake, grabbing his glasses in the meantime. He puts them on and reads the screen again and feels his heart pick up pace a little bit.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sees that Dan sent him a screenshot of his tweet with the statement and he looks it over, reading it carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t say this enough but I wanted to make it clear that I would like for my private life to remain private. It is hard to maintain a balance between being in public and also being in my private time. I ask that my privacy be respected in these times and I ask that news stations consult with me before running anything about me or the people I\u2019m associated with. If my private life continues to be a source of news for many people, I will consider taking legal action. Thank you, Daniel\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what to think reading it over. Should he have a reaction?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil throws his phone to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe gets up slowly and let\u2019s Spike out for a bathroom break before he takes a shower and get\u2019s ready for work.\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the BBC, he keeps to himself the entire day. He doesn\u2019t speak even with PJ. He finds it easier to just work on what he needs to and then leave at the time he\u2019s supposed to.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he leaves the BBC after work is over, he\u2019s met with paparazzi outside the building. Phil should have known that would happen. He keeps his head low and he fights his way through them until he reaches the other side and makes a beeline for his tube station.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe stops and picks up food at the Sainsbury\u2019s across the street from his flat and when he gets back to his flat, he lays down on his couch with Spike and cuddles him. His phone has a few messages on it from PJ, his mum, and a few from Dan. But he can\u2019t bring himself up to actually answering any of them. He finds himself in a funk of not wanting to go through all of this.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens his laptop up a few hours later. On his screen is a little window saying that his video was done exporting\u2015the assumptions video that he filmed with Dan in LA. Dan told him that his publicist told him not to post the video, but something inside of himself tells him to post it anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\tBeside him, his phone begins to vibrate for a phone call and he looks down and sees Dan\u2019s photo pop up the screen. It\u2019s a photo Phil took of Dan in LA, when they were lying in bed one night. He looked so angelic, so peaceful. But yet, the smile on his voice showed happiness like Phil has never seen before.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe picks up his phone and answers it, putting it on speaker.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered me all day,\u201d Dan says, his voice wavering a bit. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cGoing to be honest, not really.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI kind of figured,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m not either.\u201d Dan pauses and silence fills the room once again. \u201cI just wanted us to be able to have a normal relationship, ya know? Going on dates, having cute little adventures.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe still can.\u201d Phil says, feeling his voice waver and his eyes water. \u201cI want to have all of that with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s run away together.\u201d Dan says, his voice light. \u201cLet\u2019s just go off the radar and live together on some remote island.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly, do not tempt me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe could live in a little beach cottage with Spike and we could grow our own food and live off the land.\u201d Dan continues. \u201cJust you and me, forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI love the sound of that.\u201d Phil says, shutting his laptop and turning onto his side.</p><p>\t\u201cOf what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust you and me forever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe can almost hear Dan\u2019s smile through the speaker. \u201cOne day it will be.\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut for right now. We just have to make it past all of this. We just have to keep fighting the tabloids and the paparazzi. You and I can do it. We\u2019ll get past all of this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know we will.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cRemember what we promised each other when we were in LA?\u201d Dan asks, his voice having gone soft. \u201cWe promised that we\u2019d never give up on each other.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI still promise that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe too.\u201d Dan agrees. \u201cWhich is why I just wanted to remind you that we can do it. We can overcome all of this together.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have you here with me again.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hold you in my arms and never let you go.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cJust two more weeks. Two more weeks and I\u2019ll be here for a film premiere.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe either, but we have to.\u201d Dan says, a chuckle ending his words. \u201cI also can\u2019t wait to see Spike.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the mentions of his name, Spike\u2019s head perks up and he lets out a surprised yelp. Phil chuckles and Dan does too.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey talk for the rest of the night, just him and Dan. They talk about the future, and how they both want to eventually live somewhere secluded in a house with a fence around it. Dan wanted a dog for Spike to play with and they somehow came to the agreement about a Shiba Inu. Before the night was over, they were discussing kids. And although that thought would always scare Phil before, talking with Dan about how many kids they both wanted with oddly comforting.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen Dan hung up because he needed to get ready for a party, Phil was nearly falling asleep. But he wouldn\u2019t have had his evening any other way. He just has to make it these two more weeks and hopefully everything can get figured out.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star.

Just this afternoon, I was met with a pap in the park with Spike, taking photos of me and yelling after me to tell him about Dan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Martyn asked, taking a bite of his slice.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything to them.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I just ran off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Did you tell Dan about it?&rdquo; Martyn presses. &ldquo;Mum said she told you to contact him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I talked to him this afternoon.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And what did Dan say about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He&rsquo;s working with his own team to clear everything up.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t matter because nothing will change.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that what you signed up for when you began to pursue Dan?&rdquo; Martyn pressed.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start acting like mum.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not meaning to.&rdquo; Martyn paused and Phil looked at his brother. &ldquo;I just mean that you clearly decided that you wanted to be Dan so isn&rsquo;t it not all that shocking that all of this is happening? Like, Dan&rsquo;s name has been the source of headlines all over the world for the past three years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Phil says. He set&rsquo;s down his pizza slice onto his plate and pushes it aside. He doesn&rsquo;t feel hungry anymore, just sick and a bit greasy. &ldquo;But Dan isn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not that typical celebrity figure that everyone thinks he is. He hates being in the tabloids and he actively hides to try and get away. You should have seen how much he panicked even going out to get food. He normally gets his manager to pick him up something instead and bring it to his house. He also wears sunglasses and hoodies in public to try and hide but they always notice him. We went into a restaurant for a few moments and every person was staring at him. It made him so uncomfortable that he left and told me to order his food for him.&rdquo; Phil feels winded when he&rsquo;s done speaking. &ldquo;Do you know what any of what I said means?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tMartyn nods, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything right away.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil picks up his slice of pizza and takes another bite, willing himself to keep it down despite his body protesting a bit. Martyn continues to eat in silence as well and the tension in the air is pulled tight like a rubber band about to snap. Spike comes over sometime in the middle of this silence and Phil bends down and hands him a tiny bite of the pizza.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really smitten with Dan, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looks up at Martyn. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You seem to know so much about him and care about him more than you&rsquo;ve cared about anyone else in a while. You&rsquo;re quick to defend him and to state his story. You&rsquo;re really gone for him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil blushes because everything that Martyn says in true. &ldquo;I know I am.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are we going to have a new Lester in the family one day?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugs and refuses to answer. Martyn lets out a laugh and Phil chuckles as well. The tension in his stomach unknots and he feels a lot better now about everything. He finishes off two more slices of pizza and then he and Martyn watch some anime on his TV.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>I posted the statement</p><p>\t<b>Dan: </b>Marianne checked to make sure I didn&rsquo;t have any typos&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil wakes up to those messages on his phone screen. It takes him a moment to adjust to being awake, grabbing his glasses in the meantime. He puts them on and reads the screen again and feels his heart pick up pace a little bit.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe sees that Dan sent him a screenshot of his tweet with the statement and he looks it over, reading it carefully.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say this enough but I wanted to make it clear that I would like for my private life to remain private. It is hard to maintain a balance between being in public and also being in my private time. I ask that my privacy be respected in these times and I ask that news stations consult with me before running anything about me or the people I&rsquo;m associated with. If my private life continues to be a source of news for many people, I will consider taking legal action. Thank you, Daniel&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t know what to think reading it over. Should he have a reaction?&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil throws his phone to the side.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe gets up slowly and let&rsquo;s Spike out for a bathroom break before he takes a shower and get&rsquo;s ready for work.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAt the BBC, he keeps to himself the entire day. He doesn&rsquo;t speak even with PJ. He finds it easier to just work on what he needs to and then leave at the time he&rsquo;s supposed to.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen he leaves the BBC after work is over, he&rsquo;s met with paparazzi outside the building. Phil should have known that would happen. He keeps his head low and he fights his way through them until he reaches the other side and makes a beeline for his tube station.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe stops and picks up food at the Sainsbury&rsquo;s across the street from his flat and when he gets back to his flat, he lays down on his couch with Spike and cuddles him. His phone has a few messages on it from PJ, his mum, and a few from Dan. But he can&rsquo;t bring himself up to actually answering any of them. He finds himself in a funk of not wanting to go through all of this.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil opens his laptop up a few hours later. On his screen is a little window saying that his video was done exporting&#8213;the assumptions video that he filmed with Dan in LA. Dan told him that his publicist told him not to post the video, but something inside of himself tells him to post it anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBeside him, his phone begins to vibrate for a phone call and he looks down and sees Dan&rsquo;s photo pop up the screen. It&rsquo;s a photo Phil took of Dan in LA, when they were lying in bed one night. He looked so angelic, so peaceful. But yet, the smile on his voice showed happiness like Phil has never seen before.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe picks up his phone and answers it, putting it on speaker.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t answered me all day,&rdquo; Dan says, his voice wavering a bit. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil pinches the bridge of his nose. &ldquo;Going to be honest, not really.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I kind of figured,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not either.&rdquo; Dan pauses and silence fills the room once again. &ldquo;I just wanted us to be able to have a normal relationship, ya know? Going on dates, having cute little adventures.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We still can.&rdquo; Phil says, feeling his voice waver and his eyes water. &ldquo;I want to have all of that with you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run away together.&rdquo; Dan says, his voice light. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go off the radar and live together on some remote island.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Honestly, do not tempt me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We could live in a little beach cottage with Spike and we could grow our own food and live off the land.&rdquo; Dan continues. &ldquo;Just you and me, forever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I love the sound of that.&rdquo; Phil says, shutting his laptop and turning onto his side.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Just you and me forever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe can almost hear Dan&rsquo;s smile through the speaker. &ldquo;One day it will be.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;But for right now. We just have to make it past all of this. We just have to keep fighting the tabloids and the paparazzi. You and I can do it. We&rsquo;ll get past all of this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know we will.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Remember what we promised each other when we were in LA?&rdquo; Dan asks, his voice having gone soft. &ldquo;We promised that we&rsquo;d never give up on each other.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I still promise that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; Dan agrees. &ldquo;Which is why I just wanted to remind you that we can do it. We can overcome all of this together.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to have you here with me again.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hold you in my arms and never let you go.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Just two more weeks. Two more weeks and I&rsquo;ll be here for a film premiere.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait that long.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Me either, but we have to.&rdquo; Dan says, a chuckle ending his words. &ldquo;I also can&rsquo;t wait to see Spike.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tAt the mentions of his name, Spike&rsquo;s head perks up and he lets out a surprised yelp. Phil chuckles and Dan does too.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey talk for the rest of the night, just him and Dan. They talk about the future, and how they both want to eventually live somewhere secluded in a house with a fence around it. Dan wanted a dog for Spike to play with and they somehow came to the agreement about a Shiba Inu. Before the night was over, they were discussing kids. And although that thought would always scare Phil before, talking with Dan about how many kids they both wanted with oddly comforting.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen Dan hung up because he needed to get ready for a party, Phil was nearly falling asleep. But he wouldn&rsquo;t have had his evening any other way. He just has to make it these two more weeks and hopefully everything can get figured out.&nbsp;</p>",
