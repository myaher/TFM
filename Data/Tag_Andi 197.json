It also got a bit long lol</p><p>I had a couple of ideas as to what the muffin could symbolize, but the one I kept coming back to is that the muffin represents the concept of a relationship (with a guy specifically) for Cyrus.</p><!-- more --><p>So let\u2019s start with the first muffin scene, the one in \u2018Head Over Heels\u2019. Andi and Buffy are both eating muffins of their own, and Andi has an extra chocolate chocolate chip one on her plate.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"401\" data-orig-height=\"197\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/553a155eb05705b7448c137d7cf94446/tumblr_inline_pjp0guP9RR1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"401\" data-orig-height=\"197\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"454\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26d266da4ddf804a62612c261139c4be/tumblr_inline_pjp0hcFpBT1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"454\"/></figure><p>Cyrus tries to take it and when Andi stops him he asks if she\u2019s even planning on eating it. She says that she\u2019s saving it for Jonah, who hasn\u2019t shown up yet due to the Jandi drama of the week. Andi and Buffy chat for a bit about their relationship issues with Jonah and Marty respectively, then the bell rings. Andi is disappointed that Jonah never showed up, and Cyrus asks again if he can have the muffin, and after receiving no response comments that \u201cit\u2019s just going to waste\u201d.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"468\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/568a3433811d03bb1e63ad1c054c247d/tumblr_inline_pjp0hy4lK31rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"468\"/></figure><p>In this scene, the muffin specifically represents the concept of a relationship with Jonah, the guy Cyrus has a crush on, and therefore the only guy Cyrus is currently picturing himself dating. Andi is keeping Cyrus from having the muffin, even though Jonah and her are having issues and aren\u2019t even necessarily in a relationship. This is what Cyrus\u2019s love life boils down to at this point: tragically longing for someone he can\u2019t have. Cyrus also could have easily asked Andi or Buffy if he could have one of their unfinished muffins, but he\u2019s so focused on the chocolate chocolate chip muffin that he doesn\u2019t even consider asking. Andi\u2019s relationship (or lack thereof) with Jonah is keeping Cyrus from entering a relationship with anyone because he\u2019s so set on having Jonah and Jonah only.</p><p>Now, the first muffin scene in \u2018There&rsquo;s a Mack in the Shack\u2019. Cyrus is desperately counting the number of people in front of him in line to calculate how likely it is that he\u2019ll get a muffin.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bbd55793f21b5f56e86c3bc6d7c25466/tumblr_inline_pjp0k05Iw01rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\"/></figure><p>Andi comments that today might finally be his day, and he tells her not to jinx it, mentioning that he \u201cwon\u2019t do banana nut again.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/66129bc819c7a327a9ed99eec3d06d06/tumblr_inline_pjp0kryI9f1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\"/></figure><p>However, as if on cue, TJ and his friends show up and snag the last few muffins, the final one falling onto the ground and TJ stepping on it as he leaves.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"724\" data-orig-height=\"457\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1baa96a3b3e56a4275e121948c4e9890/tumblr_inline_pjp0lcIx811rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"724\" data-orig-height=\"457\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"452\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc4addedf0fca43fdc98f7ee1046f6f3/tumblr_inline_pjp0loWhYE1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"452\"/></figure><p>First off, it\u2019s very interesting that Cyrus personifies the muffins right away, he\u2019s really helping my argument here. It\u2019s also very interesting that he references another type of muffin that he\u2019s had before but doesn\u2019t want again, representing the fact that he\u2019s been in a relationship before, but the person he was with (Iris) wasn\u2019t right for him, and he doesn\u2019t want to go through that again. </p><p>Going back to the muffin representing a relationship with Jonah specifically, TJ literally takes that concept and steps on it. TJ unexpectedly turns Cyrus\u2019s love life on it\u2019s head by simply showing up. While in the scene from \u2018Head Over Heels\u2019 Cyrus couldn\u2019t get the muffin, it was still there and potentially something he could have if it weren\u2019t for Andi. In this scene however, TJ completely squashes the muffin, showing no potential for a relationship for Cyrus with either Jonah or TJ at this point.</p><p>It\u2019s also no coincidence that Andi comments that it looks like today\u2019s his day to get a muffin (aka relationship) and then TJ shows up :)</p><p>Later in the episode, we get the iconic Muffin Scene\u2122. Cyrus again is attempting but failing to get a muffin by waiting in line and it seems like his chances today are even slimmer than they were the day before.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"450\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7bba1ee5b5aa4291c254039c526d676/tumblr_inline_pjp0mgyDlt1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"450\"/></figure><p>Cue TJ again, at first only there to argue with Buffy about his tutoring, until she forces the two boys to interact by telling TJ to get Cyrus a muffin.</p><p>I think we all know what happens here, but basically TJ offers to help instead of just getting a muffin for him, and when Cyrus can\u2019t quite do it himself, TJ steps in to defend him and Cyrus finally gets his muffin. It\u2019s absolutely no coincidence that TJ and Cyrus\u2019s first interaction features Cyrus finally getting the muffin he\u2019s been wanting. He couldn\u2019t get the muffin before because he hadn\u2019t met the guy he would be in a relationship with yet.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"734\" data-orig-height=\"423\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f1e45c9f8f2afb87247b8d271638c3f/tumblr_inline_pjp0o3LWTW1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"734\" data-orig-height=\"423\"/></figure><p>On that note, Cyrus saying \u201cyou\u2019re gonna taste so sweet\u201d as he bites into the muffin represents the fact that TJ is going to become a much softer and sweeter character as the show continues. I believe it\u2019s also no coincidence that Cyrus finally gets his muffin after someone believes in him and stands up for him. To get a muffin he had to be willing to make a bold move, instead of just waiting and calculating his odds. He has to actually take charge to be in a relationship, he can\u2019t just wait and hope the universe delivers one to him. Luckily, TJ is there to help.</p><p>Finally, the muffin bet scene in \u2018Hole in the Wall\u2019, which is actually more about TJ than Cyrus. TJ is attempting to make Buffy nervous about her tryouts, but when he fails, Cyrus claims that he knew Buffy wouldn\u2019t get nervous and that TJ now owes him \u201cthe muffin of [his] choice\u201d.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"935\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15fcde4ac39795d81d2b96e7c38adc23/tumblr_inline_pjp0ox7XsC1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"935\" data-orig-height=\"520\"/></figure><p>However, when Buffy sees the girls who will be trying out she concedes that she is indeed nervous, therefore causing Cyrus to now owe TJ a muffin. When TJ wins the bet, he immediately says that he wants a blueberry macadamia muffin, and doesn\u2019t relent even when Cyrus comments that there is no such thing.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"877\" data-orig-height=\"524\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd4043f5220f71769f079e0d0a9438c1/tumblr_inline_pjp0piVjbe1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"877\" data-orig-height=\"524\"/></figure><p>TJ knows exactly what he wants in a muffin, and doesn\u2019t mind the work that needs to go into getting it. TJ definitely had his work cut out for him when it came to winning Cyrus\u2019s affection, since Cyrus was his enemy\u2019s best friend, but he rolled up his sleeves, mixed a cup and a half of character development with a hefty spoonful of rap apology and he made that muffin his.</p><p>Thanks to the texts, we know that Cyrus actually ended up baking blueberry macadamia muffins for TJ, which adds another layer of depth to this scene. Cyrus doesn\u2019t just give up when he (presumably) can\u2019t find that kind of muffin anywhere, and instead decides to buy the ingredients and bake them himself. Cyrus is willing to put time and effort into their relationship and make sure that TJ gets just as much out of it as he does. Previously he had only been focused on getting a muffin for himself, but he now cares about TJ getting a good muffin as well.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing that muffins ended up becoming a recurring symbol instead of just a device to get TJ and Cyrus to first interact. This started as just a silly concept in my head but as I dove deeper I realized it was more consistent than I first thought. I have no idea if any of this was intentional on the writers\u2019 parts, but it definitely all added up to something significant.</p>",

Andi and Buffy chat for a bit about their relationship issues with Jonah and Marty respectively, then the bell rings. Andi is disappointed that Jonah never showed up, and Cyrus asks again if he can have the muffin, and after receiving no response comments that \u201cit\u2019s just going to waste\u201d.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"468\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/568a3433811d03bb1e63ad1c054c247d/tumblr_inline_pjp0hy4lK31rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"468\"></figure><p>In this scene, the muffin specifically represents the concept of a relationship with Jonah, the guy Cyrus has a crush on, and therefore the only guy Cyrus is currently picturing himself dating. Andi is keeping Cyrus from having the muffin, even though Jonah and her are having issues and aren\u2019t even necessarily in a relationship. This is what Cyrus\u2019s love life boils down to at this point: tragically longing for someone he can\u2019t have. Cyrus also could have easily asked Andi or Buffy if he could have one of their unfinished muffins, but he\u2019s so focused on the chocolate chocolate chip muffin that he doesn\u2019t even consider asking. Andi\u2019s relationship (or lack thereof) with Jonah is keeping Cyrus from entering a relationship with anyone because he\u2019s so set on having Jonah and Jonah only.</p><p>Now, the first muffin scene in \u2018There\u2019s a Mack in the Shack\u2019. Cyrus is desperately counting the number of people in front of him in line to calculate how likely it is that he\u2019ll get a muffin.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bbd55793f21b5f56e86c3bc6d7c25466/tumblr_inline_pjp0k05Iw01rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\"></figure><p>Andi comments that today might finally be his day, and he tells her not to jinx it, mentioning that he \u201cwon\u2019t do banana nut again.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/66129bc819c7a327a9ed99eec3d06d06/tumblr_inline_pjp0kryI9f1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"449\"></figure><p>However, as if on cue, TJ and his friends show up and snag the last few muffins, the final one falling onto the ground and TJ stepping on it as he leaves.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"724\" data-orig-height=\"457\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1baa96a3b3e56a4275e121948c4e9890/tumblr_inline_pjp0lcIx811rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"724\" data-orig-height=\"457\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"452\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc4addedf0fca43fdc98f7ee1046f6f3/tumblr_inline_pjp0loWhYE1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"452\"></figure><p>First off, it\u2019s very interesting that Cyrus personifies the muffins right away, he\u2019s really helping my argument here. It\u2019s also very interesting that he references another type of muffin that he\u2019s had before but doesn\u2019t want again, representing the fact that he\u2019s been in a relationship before, but the person he was with (Iris) wasn\u2019t right for him, and he doesn\u2019t want to go through that again. </p><p>Going back to the muffin representing a relationship with Jonah specifically, TJ literally takes that concept and steps on it. TJ unexpectedly turns Cyrus\u2019s love life on it\u2019s head by simply showing up. While in the scene from \u2018Head Over Heels\u2019 Cyrus couldn\u2019t get the muffin, it was still there and potentially something he could have if it weren\u2019t for Andi. In this scene however, TJ completely squashes the muffin, showing no potential for a relationship for Cyrus with either Jonah or TJ at this point.</p><p>It\u2019s also no coincidence that Andi comments that it looks like today\u2019s his day to get a muffin (aka relationship) and then TJ shows up :)</p><p>Later in the episode, we get the iconic Muffin Scene\u2122. Cyrus again is attempting but failing to get a muffin by waiting in line and it seems like his chances today are even slimmer than they were the day before.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"450\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7bba1ee5b5aa4291c254039c526d676/tumblr_inline_pjp0mgyDlt1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"450\"></figure><p>Cue TJ again, at first only there to argue with Buffy about his tutoring, until she forces the two boys to interact by telling TJ to get Cyrus a muffin.</p><p>I think we all know what happens here, but basically TJ offers to help instead of just getting a muffin for him, and when Cyrus can\u2019t quite do it himself, TJ steps in to defend him and Cyrus finally gets his muffin. It\u2019s absolutely no coincidence that TJ and Cyrus\u2019s first interaction features Cyrus finally getting the muffin he\u2019s been wanting. He couldn\u2019t get the muffin before because he hadn\u2019t met the guy he would be in a relationship with yet.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"734\" data-orig-height=\"423\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f1e45c9f8f2afb87247b8d271638c3f/tumblr_inline_pjp0o3LWTW1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"734\" data-orig-height=\"423\"></figure><p>On that note, Cyrus saying \u201cyou\u2019re gonna taste so sweet\u201d as he bites into the muffin represents the fact that TJ is going to become a much softer and sweeter character as the show continues. I believe it\u2019s also no coincidence that Cyrus finally gets his muffin after someone believes in him and stands up for him. To get a muffin he had to be willing to make a bold move, instead of just waiting and calculating his odds. He has to actually take charge to be in a relationship, he can\u2019t just wait and hope the universe delivers one to him. Luckily, TJ is there to help.</p><p>Finally, the muffin bet scene in \u2018Hole in the Wall\u2019, which is actually more about TJ than Cyrus. TJ is attempting to make Buffy nervous about her tryouts, but when he fails, Cyrus claims that he knew Buffy wouldn\u2019t get nervous and that TJ now owes him \u201cthe muffin of [his] choice\u201d.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"935\" data-orig-height=\"520\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15fcde4ac39795d81d2b96e7c38adc23/tumblr_inline_pjp0ox7XsC1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"935\" data-orig-height=\"520\"></figure><p>However, when Buffy sees the girls who will be trying out she concedes that she is indeed nervous, therefore causing Cyrus to now owe TJ a muffin. When TJ wins the bet, he immediately says that he wants a blueberry macadamia muffin, and doesn\u2019t relent even when Cyrus comments that there is no such thing.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"877\" data-orig-height=\"524\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd4043f5220f71769f079e0d0a9438c1/tumblr_inline_pjp0piVjbe1rhdop0_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"877\" data-orig-height=\"524\"></figure><p>TJ knows exactly what he wants in a muffin, and doesn\u2019t mind the work that needs to go into getting it. TJ definitely had his work cut out for him when it came to winning Cyrus\u2019s affection, since Cyrus was his enemy\u2019s best friend, but he rolled up his sleeves, mixed a cup and a half of character development with a hefty spoonful of rap apology and he made that muffin his.</p><p>Thanks to the texts, we know that Cyrus actually ended up baking blueberry macadamia muffins for TJ, which adds another layer of depth to this scene. Cyrus doesn\u2019t just give up when he (presumably) can\u2019t find that kind of muffin anywhere, and instead decides to buy the ingredients and bake them himself. Cyrus is willing to put time and effort into their relationship and make sure that TJ gets just as much out of it as he does. Previously he had only been focused on getting a muffin for himself, but he now cares about TJ getting a good muffin as well.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing that muffins ended up becoming a recurring symbol instead of just a device to get TJ and Cyrus to first interact. This started as just a silly concept in my head but as I dove deeper I realized it was more consistent than I first thought. I have no idea if any of this was intentional on the writers\u2019 parts, but it definitely all added up to something significant.</p>",

Then they introduced the panic attack storyline which I LOVED, but I would have liked to see them get a little more in depth with that and for them to back off the ship drama with him for awhile. But now they&rsquo;ve just got him kind of doing this whole hearththrob with a guitar thing, which feels like they&rsquo;re just doing so Disney can promote Asher&rsquo;s music and it just feels&hellip; not right for the character. Not that he shouldn&rsquo;t do music at all, I actually really liked the way they started that on the show with the panic attacks, but now it&rsquo;s just feeling a little.. rushed and not genuine, idk how to explain it.<br /><br /></li><li>OBVIOUSLY I would love for more in-depth shit with <b>TJ and Cyrus</b>, but I will literally take what I can get with that, and I can&rsquo;t think of anything that hasn&rsquo;t been said before.<br /><br /></li><li>I would like to see more done with <b>Amber</b>? I don&rsquo;t know exactly what, and I&rsquo;m hoping there&rsquo;s still more to come but I really love her and I just feel like despite being in the show from the beginning, she still never got enough of her.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li><li>Also the <b>Walker </b>mess&hellip; It&rsquo;s all been said, but Walker was a great character and this whole Buffy thing has ruined it and blah. No thank u.</li></ul><p>Idk there&rsquo;s probably more, but those would be the main ones. Especially altering what we&rsquo;ve seen of Jonah, and adding more flashbacks to when Andi was a baby or before she was born. But I&rsquo;m also happy with the show how it is so yeah.</p>",
