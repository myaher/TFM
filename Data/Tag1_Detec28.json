I\u2019ll start with the downsides so that I can leave this off on a positive note since I did like the movie. Okay, here we go!</p><p>The characters weren\u2019t fleshed out nearly enough. In fact, I don\u2019t even remember their names. Not one name has stuck around in my head except those of Pokemon. They did try to give the main character a backstory but it fell flat and was very generic for a detective movie. You could probably guess it by what I just said. There is nothing original in it and, for me, it failed to evoke the feelings it was supposed to.<br/></p><p>Pikachu is, in fact, the character that is most fleshed out and is the heart and soul of the movie which is awesome since that\u2019s why you\u2019re watching the movie. But it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to give the other characters a little more opportunities to shine and reveal what is special and unique about them. As it was, Pikachu is the star of the movie and everyone else is just a supporting shadow in the background.</p><p>The story wasn\u2019t bad in itself but the execution was a little choppy for my taste. It was like \u201cThey\u2019re here, doing something, and now they\u2019re in this other place, doing another thing, and then they go to a third place&hellip;\u201d and so on. You get the idea. You can still see the plotlines that hold all of that together but everything feels kind of disjointed and once or twice it was a little too jarring for me.<br/></p><p>The thing that bothers me most is that they tried to shoehorn a subplot in there by telling us it was there when it actually wasn\u2019t. They just state it as a fact but you haven\u2019t seen it develop properly in order for it to be believable. It was shoved in there because we couldn\u2019t possibly survive without it while it would\u2019ve probably been a lot better than what they did to make it happen. There just wasn\u2019t a proper set up in order to draw the conclusion that the movie did.</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve complained about what bothered me, it\u2019s time to see what I loved in the movie. There are three things that I liked and enjoyed and as it seems they were enough to make me overlook the stuff I listed above and enjoy the movie.</p><p>First, the bond that was formed along the way between Pikachu and the main character. The way it was done had me genuinely invested in it and I was rooting for this duo long before the end of the movie (probably way before the middle too). It was heartwarming and enjoyable to watch this relationship progress and if that wasn\u2019t enough, the ending made it even better although it put things in a much different perspective.</p><p>Speaking of which, the movie has at least three major twists, and they were all done so well. When the truth is revealed, the pieces immediately click and you have no trouble remembering the foreshadowing. In fact, you go \u201cHoly shit! I should\u2019ve seen it coming!\u201d and \u201cI knew something felt off there.\u201d Also, the villain had an interesting plan that, I have to admit, had its appeal.</p><p>And last but not least, POKEMON! Let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s why we all went to watch the movie, I had no idea what it was about, I hadn\u2019t watched the trailer and I still went to see this movie because it\u2019s a movie about pokemon. How can you skip that? You shouldn\u2019t! Pokemon were absolutely awesome and totally adorable in this movie. It had an abundance of different pokemon and all of them got to show some of their powers which was totally awesome because that was the whole appeal of the movie, it\u2019s what sold it to the public and it did that well. All pokemon were memorable to a point that they outshined the human characters and totally stole the movie, which in this case is a good thing.</p><p>I did like the movie. The human characters and the story were lacking a bit, but it completely delivered on the pokemon front and that was enough to make it worthwhile. I didn\u2019t go to the theater expecting a great story and unforgettable characters. I expected to watch pokemon for an hour and a half and that\u2019s exactly what I got so I left the theater satisfied.<br/></p>",

In fact, I don\u2019t even remember their names. Not one name has stuck around in my head except those of Pokemon. They did try to give the main character a backstory but it fell flat and was very generic for a detective movie. You could probably guess it by what I just said. There is nothing original in it and, for me, it failed to evoke the feelings it was supposed to.<br></p><p>Pikachu is, in fact, the character that is most fleshed out and is the heart and soul of the movie which is awesome since that\u2019s why you\u2019re watching the movie. But it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to give the other characters a little more opportunities to shine and reveal what is special and unique about them. As it was, Pikachu is the star of the movie and everyone else is just a supporting shadow in the background.</p><p>The story wasn\u2019t bad in itself but the execution was a little choppy for my taste. It was like \u201cThey\u2019re here, doing something, and now they\u2019re in this other place, doing another thing, and then they go to a third place\u2026\u201d and so on. You get the idea. You can still see the plotlines that hold all of that together but everything feels kind of disjointed and once or twice it was a little too jarring for me.<br></p><p>The thing that bothers me most is that they tried to shoehorn a subplot in there by telling us it was there when it actually wasn\u2019t. They just state it as a fact but you haven\u2019t seen it develop properly in order for it to be believable. It was shoved in there because we couldn\u2019t possibly survive without it while it would\u2019ve probably been a lot better than what they did to make it happen. There just wasn\u2019t a proper set up in order to draw the conclusion that the movie did.</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve complained about what bothered me, it\u2019s time to see what I loved in the movie. There are three things that I liked and enjoyed and as it seems they were enough to make me overlook the stuff I listed above and enjoy the movie.</p><p>First, the bond that was formed along the way between Pikachu and the main character. The way it was done had me genuinely invested in it and I was rooting for this duo long before the end of the movie (probably way before the middle too). It was heartwarming and enjoyable to watch this relationship progress and if that wasn\u2019t enough, the ending made it even better although it put things in a much different perspective.</p><p>Speaking of which, the movie has at least three major twists, and they were all done so well. When the truth is revealed, the pieces immediately click and you have no trouble remembering the foreshadowing. In fact, you go \u201cHoly shit! I should\u2019ve seen it coming!\u201d and \u201cI knew something felt off there.\u201d Also, the villain had an interesting plan that, I have to admit, had its appeal.</p><p>And last but not least, POKEMON! Let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s why we all went to watch the movie, I had no idea what it was about, I hadn\u2019t watched the trailer and I still went to see this movie because it\u2019s a movie about pokemon. How can you skip that? You shouldn\u2019t! Pokemon were absolutely awesome and totally adorable in this movie. It had an abundance of different pokemon and all of them got to show some of their powers which was totally awesome because that was the whole appeal of the movie, it\u2019s what sold it to the public and it did that well. All pokemon were memorable to a point that they outshined the human characters and totally stole the movie, which in this case is a good thing.</p><p>I did like the movie. The human characters and the story were lacking a bit, but it completely delivered on the pokemon front and that was enough to make it worthwhile. I didn\u2019t go to the theater expecting a great story and unforgettable characters. I expected to watch pokemon for an hour and a half and that\u2019s exactly what I got so I left the theater satisfied.<br></p>",
