Opening her tablet, she decided to indulge her favorite escape: perusing vacation blogs, pretending she was planning a visit to the southern countries of Westeros.</p><p>While the south was full of cities bustling with diversity, plenty of jobs to be had for the asking, and mild weather, the north never recovered from the war. And the ten year winter season was a burden itself.</p><p>The poor economy denied basic resources for northerners, especially since King Joffrey placed tariffs on all the products exported from there as part of a trade war. In the past year, many industries closed. And families that Sansa had known all her life were moving away.</p><p>Since her father passed away five years back, there had been huge financial burdens on the family, and Sansa couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave them. So she settled on a local university to continue her dream of becoming a custom dressmaker.</p><p>Bran\u2019s snowboard accident happened not long after; in-home physical therapy and medical bills further strained the family funds. Sansa had to quit school and work two jobs. Since their mother spent her time working and caring for Bran, Arya and Rickon grew wilder by the day. Winter had come with a vengeance for the Starks.</p><p>Sleet rattled against the windows, shaking her of her recollections. Gods, what she wouldn\u2019t do to be on a southron beach right now. She was determined to reach her dreams, one way or another. She just needed a plan.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa tapped her finger on the bookmark of her favorite blog.<b>\u00a0<i>Escape to the warm, sun-kissed beaches of King\u2019s Landing!\u00a0</i></b>Sansa wished for nothing more. \u00a0Life seemed so carefree for the people who lived there. The sight of the wealthy, young, tanned and fit men and women frolicking in the waves sent a pang of envy through her.</p><p>Sansa couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had a vacation, could barely remember a time when she felt the effortless contentment in the people smiling back at her through the screen of her tablet.</p><p>Eagerly she moved onto the second one.\u00a0<i>T<b>he beautiful shores of Port Lannisport, one of the largest, richest cities of Westeros. Come to visit and see it\u2019s prosperity for yourself!</b></i></p><p><i>More beautiful, tanned people</i>, Sansa complained inwardly. This time they were wearing swimsuits that barely covered their most intimate places, enjoying champagne under burgundy and gold cabanas of the exclusive Casterly Rock Club.</p><p>Yes, Casterly Rock Club was very elegant, but she would feel too out of place there if they even allowed shabby northerners into the place. Every one of the guests was surgically enhanced and dripping in gold and diamond jewelry.</p><p>Swallowing hard, her hand instinctively went to the silver and sapphire direwolf charm at her neck, the last nameday gift she had received from her late father. It was a reminder of better times, and the ones she prayed to the gods were ahead for her. She fingered it while whispering a quick prayer to her father before tapping on the next bookmark.</p><p><i><b>Shop the opulent Lannisport Outlet Mall,</b>\u00a0<b>your one-stop destination to luxury!\u00a0</b>\u00a0 </i>Oh, she would much rather visit there! Ever since she was a little girl, Sansa loved embroidery, sewing, and designer clothing.</p><p>The scenes showed happy families laughing while eating southern delicacies, bringing up a bitter lump in her throat. Young people in the latest summer fashions carried designer Dornish leather handbags as they shopped and flirted under a shaded canopy.</p><p>Wrinkling her nose, Sansa glanced down at her sweats and ratty sweater. When <i>was</i> the last time she went shopping? Aside from The Wall Mart, there weren\u2019t many places to shop near Winterfell - and none of them fashionable. She would definitely need to do some serious online retail therapy if she ever visited Port Lannisport.</p><p>Faintly Sansa could hear her mother speaking to someone. <i>On to the next region, </i>she said to herself as she tucked her feet under her legs.</p><p><i><b>Vi</b>s<b>it the rugged hills of the Westerlands, the richest lands in Westeros.

Opening her tablet, she decided to indulge her favorite escape: perusing vacation blogs, pretending she was planning a visit to the southern countries of Westeros.</p><p>While the south was full of cities bustling with diversity, plenty of jobs to be had for the asking, and mild weather, the north never recovered from the war. And the ten year winter season was a burden itself.</p><p>The poor economy denied basic resources for northerners, especially since King Joffrey placed tariffs on all the products exported from there as part of a trade war. In the past year, many industries closed. And families that Sansa had known all her life were moving away.</p><p>Since her father passed away five years back, there had been huge financial burdens on the family, and Sansa couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave them. So she settled on a local university to continue her dream of becoming a custom dressmaker.</p><p>Bran\u2019s snowboard accident happened not long after; in-home physical therapy and medical bills further strained the family funds. Sansa had to quit school and work two jobs. Since their mother spent her time working and caring for Bran, Arya and Rickon grew wilder by the day. Winter had come with a vengeance for the Starks.</p><p>Sleet rattled against the windows, shaking her of her recollections. Gods, what she wouldn\u2019t do to be on a southron beach right now. She was determined to reach her dreams, one way or another. She just needed a plan.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa tapped her finger on the bookmark of her favorite blog.<b>\u00a0<i>Escape to the warm, sun-kissed beaches of King\u2019s Landing!\u00a0</i></b>Sansa wished for nothing more. \u00a0Life seemed so carefree for the people who lived there. The sight of the wealthy, young, tanned and fit men and women frolicking in the waves sent a pang of envy through her.</p><p>Sansa couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had a vacation, could barely remember a time when she felt the effortless contentment in the people smiling back at her through the screen of her tablet.</p><p>Eagerly she moved onto the second one.\u00a0<i>T<b>he beautiful shores of Port Lannisport, one of the largest, richest cities of Westeros. Come to visit and see it\u2019s prosperity for yourself!</b></i></p><p><i>More beautiful, tanned people</i>, Sansa complained inwardly. This time they were wearing swimsuits that barely covered their most intimate places, enjoying champagne under burgundy and gold cabanas of the exclusive Casterly Rock Club.</p><p>Yes, Casterly Rock Club was very elegant, but she would feel too out of place there if they even allowed shabby northerners into the place. Every one of the guests was surgically enhanced and dripping in gold and diamond jewelry.</p><p>Swallowing hard, her hand instinctively went to the silver and sapphire direwolf charm at her neck, the last nameday gift she had received from her late father. It was a reminder of better times, and the ones she prayed to the gods were ahead for her. She fingered it while whispering a quick prayer to her father before tapping on the next bookmark.</p><p><i><b>Shop the opulent Lannisport Outlet Mall,</b>\u00a0<b>your one-stop destination to luxury!\u00a0</b>\u00a0 </i>Oh, she would much rather visit there! Ever since she was a little girl, Sansa loved embroidery, sewing, and designer clothing.</p><p>The scenes showed happy families laughing while eating southern delicacies, bringing up a bitter lump in her throat. Young people in the latest summer fashions carried designer Dornish leather handbags as they shopped and flirted under a shaded canopy.</p><p>Wrinkling her nose, Sansa glanced down at her sweats and ratty sweater. When <i>was</i> the last time she went shopping? Aside from The Wall Mart, there weren\u2019t many places to shop near Winterfell - and none of them fashionable. She would definitely need to do some serious online retail therapy if she ever visited Port Lannisport.</p><p>Faintly Sansa could hear her mother speaking to someone. <i>On to the next region, </i>she said to herself as she tucked her feet under her legs.</p><p><i><b>Vi</b>s<b>it the rugged hills of the Westerlands, the richest lands in Westeros. A landscape dotted with golden, rolling plains and caves from which gold and silver mines pour forth deep veins in astonishing quantities. Abundant gemstones and precious metals mean lower prices on all your jewelry needs!</b></i></p><p>With widened eyes, Sansa clicked on the pictures of black fertile fields, apple orchards, Pinot grape vineyards, and Black Mission fig tree groves. Further inland lay dense maple forests that opened up to crystal blue lakes and river rapids, reportedly renowned worldwide for whitewater rafting.</p><p>Gemstones of all kinds, gold and silver jewelry, beautiful log homes in the verdant foothills all caught her attention. Oh, she would definitely visit the Westerlands first! The featured delicacies and riches were sensational!</p><p>But how could she go?
