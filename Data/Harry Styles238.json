It\u2019s 2018 now and obviously everyone prefers social media than real life interactions, that\u2019s fine by him. However, today as he\u2019s walking to his favorite food court on campus to meet his friends for lunch, Harry finds it unusual as almost everyone he passes by are watching the same video on their devices. In fact, now he has the audio stuck inside his head and he hasn\u2019t even watched that viral clip yet.\u00a0</p><p>Is this the part where everyone turns into zombies and he has to save the world on his own?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with everybody today?\u201d Harry asks the girl friend next to him while scanning his eyes around the room.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, some guy posted a clip of himself playing instruments and now the whole school is obsessed,\u201d she replies, making him\u00a0furrow his eyebrows in confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so special with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he plays 90 instruments and can sing very well,\u201d the girl says then shows Harry the clip on her phone.</p><p>It\u2019s a three minute cover of the song God Is A Woman by Ariana Grande, played by 90 instruments, and it was creatively arranged. Harry\u2019s got to admit this guy is talented.</p><p>\u201cBut I still don\u2019t understand all the hype for him, sure he\u2019s good but&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, honey, Lemme educate you real quick!\u201d The girl snaps her fingers as she clears her throat and sits up straight.\u00a0\u201cThis man is <i>anything</i> but ordinary, he recently moved here from France, he was very popular there because he won a national talent show,\u00a0got here on a prestige scholarship, blessed with a\u00a0look of a\u00a0Greek God but like&hellip;French, and he plays all kinds of instruments you can think of, and\u00a0has a voice of an angel, most importantly, he\u2019s an Aquarius, which is perfect for me!\u201d</p><p>Harry widens his eyes whilst his mouth falls open, unable to believe she just said all that in only one breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t get it, he has zero, ZERO flaw!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWho has zero flaw?\u201d Niall returns with his tray of food and joins his two friends at their table.</p><p>\u201cLayla\u2019s telling me about this new French guy everyone\u2019s obsessed about,\u201d Harry answers, holding the straw between his teeth, smirking like what he just said was most ridiculous thing ever.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve seen the clip then?\u201d Niall sits down in front of them and nods his head knowingly. \u201cEliot Th\u00e9riault, we had a class together this morning, cool dude, he\u2019s hilarious.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Layla rests her chin on her knuckles and her elbows on the table. Her eyes twinkle with excitement. \u201cWhat class? I\u2019m gonna take it, gonna be his new \u2018study buddy\u2019, if you know what I mean.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJesus, calm down woman,\u201d Niall chuckles before turning to Harry, who\u2019s cringing at Layla so hard. \u201cBy the way, Y/N was in the same class with us, I think you should hold on to your girl, she\u2019s one of the victims, like Layla here.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh please, Y/N\u2019s not like that.\u201d Harry snorts, but right after finishing that sentence, he hears his name being called from a few tables away. His girlfriend\u2019s walking fast towards them with that familiar big smile on her face, which alarms him that she\u2019s here with some news, it\u2019s either really great or just severely terrible. </p><p>\u201cI just met a Greek God, but he\u2019s French!\u201d Y/N announces once she stops at the table.</p><p>That is, apparently, all Layla has been waiting for just so she can shout out, \u201csee??? That\u2019s what I fuckin\u2019 said!\u201d</p><p>Harry facepalms himself, while Niall bursts into laughter, and Y/N finds it amusing though it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s seen these reactions from the two of them simultaneously. </p><p>She takes a seat next to Niall and reaches forward to pat her boyfriend gently on the cheek as a loving gesture.</p><p>\u201cC'mon, H, I had to fangirl a little bit,\u201d she reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that I\u2019ve got to sit in class next to a viral star!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI second that!\u201d Layla cuts in. \u201cBut please stick to Harry so I have a shot with a hot guy.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWow, Layla!\u201d Y/N chuckles at the girl\u2019s statement. Most of Harry\u2019s friends are not very supportive of his relationship with Y/N since the two of them are poles apart, so to hear his friend say something like that is a whole new experience to Y/N.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me your new best friend, princess.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow unfortunate.\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes in a sarcastic way, which makes Harry snigger. He likes how sassy she is sometimes, as a matter of fact, her eye-rolling never fails to turn him on.</p><p>\u201cNiall, have you told Harry?\u201d she suddenly asks. No matter what that news is, she sure looks very eager for her boyfriend to know.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, right, Eliot has a live show tonight at a restaurant downtown, Y/N and I are invited but we\u2019re allowed to bring some friends.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cancel my family dinner!\u201d Layla immediately unlocks her phone and stands up right away which surprises the other three at the table, \u201cmum, yeah, I cannot come tonight-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI think she hasn\u2019t had sex in a while,\u201d Niall admits once his female friend is gone, then he asks Harry if he wants to come as well.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good, I don\u2019t even know the guy so,\u201d Harry replies with a shrug, promptly given the look of doubt from his best friend and girlfriend.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou sure, mate? Because I think he\u2019s quite fond of Y/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>Niall\u2019s assertion causes Harry to nearly choke on his water. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he declares in less than no time. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going.\u201d</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Eliot is&hellip;<i>nice</i>. Harry was hoping he would be an asshole instead, but he looks\u00a0exactly like the perfect human being his friends described, which makes him a lot more intimidating, because he could be faking his down-to-earth personality and nobody would know for how well he does it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was great, mate!\u201d Niall compliments Eliot who just leaves the stage to another performer of the night.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Merci!</i> I\u2019m glad you guys enjoyed it!\u201d says Eliot in a thick French accent, and whilst Layla obviously swoons, Harry has to take a glance at Y/N to see her reaction. She has her usual smiley face on, but who knows what on earth she\u2019s actually thinking about.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about dinner. My uncle\u2019s the owner of this restaurant. You don\u2019t have to pay.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve found my Christian Grey.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDamn it, Layla!\u201d Niall cries out as he throws his head back and everybody else laughs, except for Layla, who rolls her eyes in a sassy way and tells Niall to fuck off.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo Y/N&hellip;\u201d Both Y/N and Harry flinch when her name is called. \u201cDid you like my performance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I love it, I think it\u2019s great, you\u2019re so talented.\u201d She sighs, holding both of her hands together.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Layla slightly nudges Harry, then leans over to whisper to him,\u00a0\u201cif you\u2019re secretly plotting his death, you\u00a0gotta be more discreet than that murderous look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Harry says, though he cannot deny he\u2019s been giving Eliot the death stare ever since their first met, just\u00a0to clarify that his Y/N is untouchable.\u00a0</p><p>He has no idea whether it\u2019s just his imagination playing tricks on him or he just thinks that way about every guy around Y/N, but Eliot\u2019s been extra nice to her compared to how he treats others. This guy would always make eye-contact with only her when he speaks, only ask if she\u2019d like some more water (as if nobody else drank water besides Y/N)! Then he would find some lame excuse to touch her in some ways, either it\u2019s a supposedly\u00a0\u2018<i>friendly</i>\u2019 hug or him brushing his fingers against her arm during a conversation. Harry\u2019s not usually short-temper, but tonight he has to tolerate a lot!</p><p>He\u2019s told her about it, but she shrugged it off as always, telling him that he worries too much. How can she blame him? He has a solid reason to worry. He knows what Eliot wants by the look on his face because, before Y/N, Harry himself used to look at the other pretty girls just like that. His instinct is never wrong.</p><p>As the group walk back to their cars parked a few blocks away, Harry has his arms secured around his girl\u2019s shoulders and doesn\u2019t let go for even one second. It\u2019s apparent enough for everyone else, but he just doesn\u2019t see why Eliot cannot stop coming for Y/N. Maybe the guy is\u00a0not <i>perfect</i>, after all.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t follow Dr. Friedrich\u2019s lectures! Those concepts are so hard to grasp,\u201d Eliot complains while looking at Y/N, who\u2019s just awfully sweet as always (sometimes Harry hates how nice she is, ironically that what made him fall in love with her in the first place).<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand anything Niall and I can help.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, leave Nialler out of this please. All I did was sleep in that class,\u201d Niall\u2019s response makes Layla snort.<br/></p><p>\u201cThen I think you\u2019re my only hope now, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an easy course,\u201d Harry speaks up all of a sudden, watching in amusement as Eliot\u2019s expression hardens.\u00a0\u201cI mean,\u00a0I don\u2019t even need to attend those classes to understand what\u2019s in the text-book.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI find it more challenging to learn something entirely in English.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cReally? Did you get your scholarship by doing an entrance exam in French?\u201d</p><p>Niall hurriedly steps in between the guys, holding up his hands in the air as he tells them both to chill.\u00a0\u201cAre you guys seriously gonna fight over a university course?!\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;They\u2019re fighting for\u00a0Y/N, actually,\u201d Layla corrects and all eyes are on her.\u00a0Y/N looks utterly confused and surprised, but ironically now neither of those two guys pays attention to her.</p><p>\u201cI was speaking to Y/N, do you know how rude it is to interrupt people, Harold?\u201d Eliot asks with a smirk, clearly starting a war for saying so, and Harry\u2019s just so fed up right now.<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you know how rude it is to flirt with someone\u2019s girlfriend right in front of them?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot when your girl is thirsty for a bit of my attention.\u201d<br/></p><p>Just as Eliot finishes that sentence, Harry\u2019s fist knocks him onto the ground! Y/N and Niall have to hold Harry back from causing more damage to the other guy\u2019s face, and if it\u2019s not for them, Eliot would probably end up in the hospital for what he said.</p><p>\u201cHarry, leave him!\u201d Y/N tugs on her boyfriend\u2019s arm and looks worriedly at Eliot sitting on the ground, painfully cupping his bruised eye. She\u2019s not worried for him, she\u2019s worried for Harry, if his fans know Harry did that to him, she\u2019s afraid something bad would happen. But Harry doesn\u2019t seem to give a damn, he\u00a0turns to Y/N, asks if she\u2019s alright then tells her he\u2019ll take her home.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking filming this?\u201d Eliot asks as he sees Layla pointing her phone at him.\u00a0</p><p>She gives him a smirk.\u00a0\u201cThe new viral star getting punched in the face for being an asshole, <i>that,</i> I would pay to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry, handsome. If I had to pick between you and Harry, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d Layla puts her phone away and walks off, leaving Harry and Y/N shocked as hell. Niall, on the other hand, looks particularly impressed as he\u00a0hurries up to catch up with Layla.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d Harry finally dares to question when he follows Y/N into their shared flat. She throws her bag onto the couch as well as herself before turning her head to him.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot at you, at myself!\u201d she answers.<br/></p><p>Harry takes a seat next to his girlfriend then asks her why she said that when she didn\u2019t even do anything wrong, it was him who punched someone in the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so easy to be taken advantage of! It seems like everyone\u2019s an asshole to me and I just let them!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, he kind of had Layla and Niall fooled too.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot just him. Everyone! And every time you warned me about it, I just completely ignored, now I\u2019ve got you in trouble! How can you walk around campus tomorrow if Eliot tells his fans you hurt him?\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles at her facial expression.\u00a0\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t even show up at school to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously making a joke right now?\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry laughs as he apologizes and lies down on the sofa with his head on her lap like a little boy. Sometimes it\u2019s still overwhelming for Y/N that Harry can just go from the guy who\u2019s willing to punch anyone he dislikes, to the guy who lets her paint his nail and cries while watching rom-com, and it makes her feels like the luckiest for she\u2019s the only person who gets to see the soft side of him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for looking out for me,\u201d\u00a0she breaks the silence between the two of them after a while, fingers gently running through his dark locks.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing that ever since we met, I know you don\u2019t have to, but you do it all the time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t have to? You\u2019re a baby.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSaid the one lying on my lap so I can stroke his hair.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m gonna let you win this time, only because I\u2019m enjoying this.\u201d\u00a0Harry closes his eyes and chuckles when Y/N leans down to kiss him on the cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to learn not to trust everyone you meet, for when I\u2019m not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have to make sure you\u2019ll always be around,\u201d she tells him, her eyes flicker with joy, but\u00a0Harry doesn\u2019t say anything back.</p><p>He just hopes she doesn\u2019t notice how his smile slowly fades away.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Y/N wakes up way too early the next morning because of Harry\u2019s alarm. Somehow he never wakes up before 9 o\u2019clock but always has his alarm set at 6 AM.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s still deep in his sleep to be bothered by that annoying sound. He has one arm locked around her waist, both of them naked, tangled up under the wrinkled sheet as a result of their crazy night.\u00a0</p><p>Careful not to wake Harry, Y/N reaches over him to grab his phone on the bedside table on his side. She turns the alarm off, then it hits her like a train when she sees multiple notifications on his locked screen, all tagging and mentioning him in an Instagram post. Quickly, she grabs her own phone to check if she\u2019s received any notification as well; and she has.\u00a0</p><p>Apparently, Layla wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she would post that video.</p><p>\u201cHarry, wake up!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry groans and buries his face into his pillow, but Y/N shakes his shoulders even harder.<br/></p><p>\u201cWake up! Harry, you\u2019re famous!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, Layla posted the video!\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry immediately sits up straight and his eyes bug out when he looks at the screen of his phone. <i>Holy fuck, Layla!</i></p><p>\u201cUgh look at these angry people. Eliot\u2019s so canceled.\u201d Y/N cringes when she scrolls down the comment section on the clip.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, look at all these girls calling me hot, I guess I don\u2019t mind being famous.\u201d Harry gives Y/N a toothy grin only to have his girlfriend skew up her face at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot funny!\u201d She curls her lips.\u00a0\u201cWell, but at least they\u2019re in love with you not hating on you so I think that\u2019s good.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAww, look at you being supportive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry laughs and goes ahead to check the rest of the notifications. That\u2019s when he realizes how lucky he is that Y/N hasn\u2019t seen all of them, because there\u2019s a new message from Niall earlier this morning, which would get him in so much trouble if she was to find out.</p><ul><li><i>Congrats on that internship! But how are u gonna tell Y/N that you\u2018ve got to\u00a0be in Japan for 6 months?</i></li></ul>",

Her eyes twinkle with excitement. \u201cWhat class? I\u2019m gonna take it, gonna be his new \u2018study buddy\u2019, if you know what I mean.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJesus, calm down woman,\u201d Niall chuckles before turning to Harry, who\u2019s cringing at Layla so hard. \u201cBy the way, Y/N was in the same class with us, I think you should hold on to your girl, she\u2019s one of the victims, like Layla here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh please, Y/N\u2019s not like that.\u201d Harry snorts, but right after finishing that sentence, he hears his name being called from a few tables away. His girlfriend\u2019s walking fast towards them with that familiar big smile on her face, which alarms him that she\u2019s here with some news, it\u2019s either really great or just severely terrible. </p><p>\u201cI just met a Greek God, but he\u2019s French!\u201d Y/N announces once she stops at the table.</p><p>That is, apparently, all Layla has been waiting for just so she can shout out, \u201csee??? That\u2019s what I fuckin\u2019 said!\u201d</p><p>Harry facepalms himself, while Niall bursts into laughter, and Y/N finds it amusing though it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s seen these reactions from the two of them simultaneously. </p><p>She takes a seat next to Niall and reaches forward to pat her boyfriend gently on the cheek as a loving gesture.</p><p>\u201cC'mon, H, I had to fangirl a little bit,\u201d she reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that I\u2019ve got to sit in class next to a viral star!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI second that!\u201d Layla cuts in. \u201cBut please stick to Harry so I have a shot with a hot guy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow, Layla!\u201d Y/N chuckles at the girl\u2019s statement. Most of Harry\u2019s friends are not very supportive of his relationship with Y/N since the two of them are poles apart, so to hear his friend say something like that is a whole new experience to Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me your new best friend, princess.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow unfortunate.\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes in a sarcastic way, which makes Harry snigger. He likes how sassy she is sometimes, as a matter of fact, her eye-rolling never fails to turn him on.</p><p>\u201cNiall, have you told Harry?\u201d she suddenly asks. No matter what that news is, she sure looks very eager for her boyfriend to know.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, right, Eliot has a live show tonight at a restaurant downtown, Y/N and I are invited but we\u2019re allowed to bring some friends.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cancel my family dinner!\u201d Layla immediately unlocks her phone and stands up right away which surprises the other three at the table, \u201cmum, yeah, I cannot come tonight-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think she hasn\u2019t had sex in a while,\u201d Niall admits once his female friend is gone, then he asks Harry if he wants to come as well.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good, I don\u2019t even know the guy so,\u201d Harry replies with a shrug, promptly given the look of doubt from his best friend and girlfriend.<br></p><p>\u201cYou sure, mate? Because I think he\u2019s quite fond of Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>Niall\u2019s assertion causes Harry to nearly choke on his water. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he declares in less than no time. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Eliot is\u2026<i>nice</i>. Harry was hoping he would be an asshole instead, but he looks\u00a0exactly like the perfect human being his friends described, which makes him a lot more intimidating, because he could be faking his down-to-earth personality and nobody would know for how well he does it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was great, mate!\u201d Niall compliments Eliot who just leaves the stage to another performer of the night.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Merci!</i> I\u2019m glad you guys enjoyed it!\u201d says Eliot in a thick French accent, and whilst Layla obviously swoons, Harry has to take a glance at Y/N to see her reaction. She has her usual smiley face on, but who knows what on earth she\u2019s actually thinking about.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about dinner. My uncle\u2019s the owner of this restaurant. You don\u2019t have to pay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve found my Christian Grey.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn it, Layla!\u201d Niall cries out as he throws his head back and everybody else laughs, except for Layla, who rolls her eyes in a sassy way and tells Niall to fuck off.<br></p><p>\u201cSo Y/N\u2026\u201d Both Y/N and Harry flinch when her name is called. \u201cDid you like my performance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I love it, I think it\u2019s great, you\u2019re so talented.\u201d She sighs, holding both of her hands together.\u00a0<br></p><p>Layla slightly nudges Harry, then leans over to whisper to him,\u00a0\u201cif you\u2019re secretly plotting his death, you\u00a0gotta be more discreet than that murderous look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Harry says, though he cannot deny he\u2019s been giving Eliot the death stare ever since their first met, just\u00a0to clarify that his Y/N is untouchable.\u00a0</p><p>He has no idea whether it\u2019s just his imagination playing tricks on him or he just thinks that way about every guy around Y/N, but Eliot\u2019s been extra nice to her compared to how he treats others. This guy would always make eye-contact with only her when he speaks, only ask if she\u2019d like some more water (as if nobody else drank water besides Y/N)! Then he would find some lame excuse to touch her in some ways, either it\u2019s a supposedly\u00a0\u2018<i>friendly</i>\u2019 hug or him brushing his fingers against her arm during a conversation. Harry\u2019s not usually short-temper, but tonight he has to tolerate a lot!</p><p>He\u2019s told her about it, but she shrugged it off as always, telling him that he worries too much. How can she blame him? He has a solid reason to worry. He knows what Eliot wants by the look on his face because, before Y/N, Harry himself used to look at the other pretty girls just like that. His instinct is never wrong.</p><p>As the group walk back to their cars parked a few blocks away, Harry has his arms secured around his girl\u2019s shoulders and doesn\u2019t let go for even one second. It\u2019s apparent enough for everyone else, but he just doesn\u2019t see why Eliot cannot stop coming for Y/N. Maybe the guy is\u00a0not <i>perfect</i>, after all.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t follow Dr. Friedrich\u2019s lectures! Those concepts are so hard to grasp,\u201d Eliot complains while looking at Y/N, who\u2019s just awfully sweet as always (sometimes Harry hates how nice she is, ironically that what made him fall in love with her in the first place).<br></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand anything Niall and I can help.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, leave Nialler out of this please. All I did was sleep in that class,\u201d Niall\u2019s response makes Layla snort.<br></p><p>\u201cThen I think you\u2019re my only hope now, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an easy course,\u201d Harry speaks up all of a sudden, watching in amusement as Eliot\u2019s expression hardens.\u00a0\u201cI mean,\u00a0I don\u2019t even need to attend those classes to understand what\u2019s in the text-book.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI find it more challenging to learn something entirely in English.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cReally? Did you get your scholarship by doing an entrance exam in French?\u201d</p><p>Niall hurriedly steps in between the guys, holding up his hands in the air as he tells them both to chill.\u00a0\u201cAre you guys seriously gonna fight over a university course?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting for\u00a0Y/N, actually,\u201d Layla corrects and all eyes are on her.\u00a0Y/N looks utterly confused and surprised, but ironically now neither of those two guys pays attention to her.</p><p>\u201cI was speaking to Y/N, do you know how rude it is to interrupt people, Harold?\u201d Eliot asks with a smirk, clearly starting a war for saying so, and Harry\u2019s just so fed up right now.<br></p><p>\u201cDo you know how rude it is to flirt with someone\u2019s girlfriend right in front of them?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot when your girl is thirsty for a bit of my attention.\u201d<br></p><p>Just as Eliot finishes that sentence, Harry\u2019s fist knocks him onto the ground! Y/N and Niall have to hold Harry back from causing more damage to the other guy\u2019s face, and if it\u2019s not for them, Eliot would probably end up in the hospital for what he said.</p><p>\u201cHarry, leave him!\u201d Y/N tugs on her boyfriend\u2019s arm and looks worriedly at Eliot sitting on the ground, painfully cupping his bruised eye. She\u2019s not worried for him, she\u2019s worried for Harry, if his fans know Harry did that to him, she\u2019s afraid something bad would happen. But Harry doesn\u2019t seem to give a damn, he\u00a0turns to Y/N, asks if she\u2019s alright then tells her he\u2019ll take her home.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking filming this?\u201d Eliot asks as he sees Layla pointing her phone at him.\u00a0</p><p>She gives him a smirk.\u00a0\u201cThe new viral star getting punched in the face for being an asshole, <i>that,</i> I would pay to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, handsome. If I had to pick between you and Harry, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d Layla puts her phone away and walks off, leaving Harry and Y/N shocked as hell. Niall, on the other hand, looks particularly impressed as he\u00a0hurries up to catch up with Layla.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d Harry finally dares to question when he follows Y/N into their shared flat. She throws her bag onto the couch as well as herself before turning her head to him.<br></p><p>\u201cNot at you, at myself!\u201d she answers.<br></p><p>Harry takes a seat next to his girlfriend then asks her why she said that when she didn\u2019t even do anything wrong, it was him who punched someone in the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so easy to be taken advantage of! It seems like everyone\u2019s an asshole to me and I just let them!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, he kind of had Layla and Niall fooled too.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot just him. Everyone! And every time you warned me about it, I just completely ignored, now I\u2019ve got you in trouble! How can you walk around campus tomorrow if Eliot tells his fans you hurt him?\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles at her facial expression.\u00a0\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t even show up at school to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously making a joke right now?\u201d<br></p><p>Harry laughs as he apologizes and lies down on the sofa with his head on her lap like a little boy. Sometimes it\u2019s still overwhelming for Y/N that Harry can just go from the guy who\u2019s willing to punch anyone he dislikes, to the guy who lets her paint his nail and cries while watching rom-com, and it makes her feels like the luckiest for she\u2019s the only person who gets to see the soft side of him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for looking out for me,\u201d\u00a0she breaks the silence between the two of them after a while, fingers gently running through his dark locks.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing that ever since we met, I know you don\u2019t have to, but you do it all the time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t have to? You\u2019re a baby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSaid the one lying on my lap so I can stroke his hair.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m gonna let you win this time, only because I\u2019m enjoying this.\u201d\u00a0Harry closes his eyes and chuckles when Y/N leans down to kiss him on the cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to learn not to trust everyone you meet, for when I\u2019m not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have to make sure you\u2019ll always be around,\u201d she tells him, her eyes flicker with joy, but\u00a0Harry doesn\u2019t say anything back.</p><p>He just hopes she doesn\u2019t notice how his smile slowly fades away.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Y/N wakes up way too early the next morning because of Harry\u2019s alarm. Somehow he never wakes up before 9 o\u2019clock but always has his alarm set at 6 AM.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s still deep in his sleep to be bothered by that annoying sound. He has one arm locked around her waist, both of them naked, tangled up under the wrinkled sheet as a result of their crazy night.\u00a0</p><p>Careful not to wake Harry, Y/N reaches over him to grab his phone on the bedside table on his side. She turns the alarm off, then it hits her like a train when she sees multiple notifications on his locked screen, all tagging and mentioning him in an Instagram post. Quickly, she grabs her own phone to check if she\u2019s received any notification as well; and she has.\u00a0</p><p>Apparently, Layla wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she would post that video.</p><p>\u201cHarry, wake up!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry groans and buries his face into his pillow, but Y/N shakes his shoulders even harder.<br></p><p>\u201cWake up! Harry, you\u2019re famous!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, Layla posted the video!\u201d<br></p><p>Harry immediately sits up straight and his eyes bug out when he looks at the screen of his phone. <i>Holy fuck, Layla!</i></p><p>\u201cUgh look at these angry people. Eliot\u2019s so canceled.\u201d Y/N cringes when she scrolls down the comment section on the clip.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, look at all these girls calling me hot, I guess I don\u2019t mind being famous.\u201d Harry gives Y/N a toothy grin only to have his girlfriend skew up her face at him.<br></p><p>\u201cNot funny!\u201d She curls her lips.\u00a0\u201cWell, but at least they\u2019re in love with you not hating on you so I think that\u2019s good.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAww, look at you being supportive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry laughs and goes ahead to check the rest of the notifications. That\u2019s when he realizes how lucky he is that Y/N hasn\u2019t seen all of them, because there\u2019s a new message from Niall earlier this morning, which would get him in so much trouble if she was to find out.</p><ul><li><i>Congrats on that internship! But how are u gonna tell Y/N that you\u2018ve got to\u00a0be in Japan for 6 months?</i></li></ul></p>",

It\u2019s 2018 now and obviously everyone prefers social media than real life interactions, that\u2019s fine by him. However, today as he\u2019s walking to his favorite food court on campus to meet his friends for lunch, Harry finds it unusual as almost everyone he passes by are watching the same video on their devices. In fact, now he has the audio stuck inside his head and he hasn\u2019t even watched that viral clip yet.\u00a0</p><p>Is this the part where everyone turns into zombies and he has to save the world on his own?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with everybody today?\u201d Harry asks the girl friend next to him while scanning his eyes around the room.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, some guy posted a clip of himself playing instruments and now the whole school is obsessed,\u201d she replies, making him\u00a0furrow his eyebrows in confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so special with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he plays 90 instruments and can sing very well,\u201d the girl says then shows Harry the clip on her phone.</p><p>It\u2019s a three minute cover of the song God Is A Woman by Ariana Grande, played by 90 instruments, and it was creatively arranged. Harry\u2019s got to admit this guy is talented.</p><p>\u201cBut I still don\u2019t understand all the hype for him, sure he\u2019s good but\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, honey, Lemme educate you real quick!\u201d The girl snaps her fingers as she clears her throat and sits up straight.\u00a0\u201cThis man is <i>anything</i> but ordinary, he recently moved here from France, he was very popular there because he won a national talent show,\u00a0got here on a prestige scholarship, blessed with a\u00a0look of a\u00a0Greek God but like\u2026French, and he plays all kinds of instruments you can think of, and\u00a0has a voice of an angel, most importantly, he\u2019s an Aquarius, which is perfect for me!\u201d</p><p>Harry widens his eyes whilst his mouth falls open, unable to believe she just said all that in only one breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t get it, he has zero, ZERO flaw!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWho has zero flaw?\u201d Niall returns with his tray of food and joins his two friends at their table.</p><p>\u201cLayla\u2019s telling me about this new French guy everyone\u2019s obsessed about,\u201d Harry answers, holding the straw between his teeth, smirking like what he just said was most ridiculous thing ever.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve seen the clip then?\u201d Niall sits down in front of them and nods his head knowingly. \u201cEliot Th\u00e9riault, we had a class together this morning, cool dude, he\u2019s hilarious.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Layla rests her chin on her knuckles and her elbows on the table. Her eyes twinkle with excitement. \u201cWhat class? I\u2019m gonna take it, gonna be his new \u2018study buddy\u2019, if you know what I mean.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJesus, calm down woman,\u201d Niall chuckles before turning to Harry, who\u2019s cringing at Layla so hard. \u201cBy the way, Y/N was in the same class with us, I think you should hold on to your girl, she\u2019s one of the victims, like Layla here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh please, Y/N\u2019s not like that.\u201d Harry snorts, but right after finishing that sentence, he hears his name being called from a few tables away. His girlfriend\u2019s walking fast towards them with that familiar big smile on her face, which alarms him that she\u2019s here with some news, it\u2019s either really great or just severely terrible. </p><p>\u201cI just met a Greek God, but he\u2019s French!\u201d Y/N announces once she stops at the table.</p><p>That is, apparently, all Layla has been waiting for just so she can shout out, \u201csee??? That\u2019s what I fuckin\u2019 said!\u201d</p><p>Harry facepalms himself, while Niall bursts into laughter, and Y/N finds it amusing though it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s seen these reactions from the two of them simultaneously. </p><p>She takes a seat next to Niall and reaches forward to pat her boyfriend gently on the cheek as a loving gesture.</p><p>\u201cC'mon, H, I had to fangirl a little bit,\u201d she reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that I\u2019ve got to sit in class next to a viral star!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI second that!\u201d Layla cuts in. \u201cBut please stick to Harry so I have a shot with a hot guy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow, Layla!\u201d Y/N chuckles at the girl\u2019s statement. Most of Harry\u2019s friends are not very supportive of his relationship with Y/N since the two of them are poles apart, so to hear his friend say something like that is a whole new experience to Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me your new best friend, princess.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow unfortunate.\u201d Y/N rolls her eyes in a sarcastic way, which makes Harry snigger. He likes how sassy she is sometimes, as a matter of fact, her eye-rolling never fails to turn him on.</p><p>\u201cNiall, have you told Harry?\u201d she suddenly asks. No matter what that news is, she sure looks very eager for her boyfriend to know.<br></p><p>\u201cOh, right, Eliot has a live show tonight at a restaurant downtown, Y/N and I are invited but we\u2019re allowed to bring some friends.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cancel my family dinner!\u201d Layla immediately unlocks her phone and stands up right away which surprises the other three at the table, \u201cmum, yeah, I cannot come tonight-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think she hasn\u2019t had sex in a while,\u201d Niall admits once his female friend is gone, then he asks Harry if he wants to come as well.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good, I don\u2019t even know the guy so,\u201d Harry replies with a shrug, promptly given the look of doubt from his best friend and girlfriend.<br></p><p>\u201cYou sure, mate? Because I think he\u2019s quite fond of Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>Niall\u2019s assertion causes Harry to nearly choke on his water. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he declares in less than no time. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Eliot is\u2026<i>nice</i>. Harry was hoping he would be an asshole instead, but he looks\u00a0exactly like the perfect human being his friends described, which makes him a lot more intimidating, because he could be faking his down-to-earth personality and nobody would know for how well he does it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was great, mate!\u201d Niall compliments Eliot who just leaves the stage to another performer of the night.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Merci!</i> I\u2019m glad you guys enjoyed it!\u201d says Eliot in a thick French accent, and whilst Layla obviously swoons, Harry has to take a glance at Y/N to see her reaction. She has her usual smiley face on, but who knows what on earth she\u2019s actually thinking about.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about dinner. My uncle\u2019s the owner of this restaurant. You don\u2019t have to pay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve found my Christian Grey.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDamn it, Layla!\u201d Niall cries out as he throws his head back and everybody else laughs, except for Layla, who rolls her eyes in a sassy way and tells Niall to fuck off.<br></p><p>\u201cSo Y/N\u2026\u201d Both Y/N and Harry flinch when her name is called. \u201cDid you like my performance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I love it, I think it\u2019s great, you\u2019re so talented.\u201d She sighs, holding both of her hands together.\u00a0<br></p><p>Layla slightly nudges Harry, then leans over to whisper to him,\u00a0\u201cif you\u2019re secretly plotting his death, you\u00a0gotta be more discreet than that murderous look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Harry says, though he cannot deny he\u2019s been giving Eliot the death stare ever since their first met, just\u00a0to clarify that his Y/N is untouchable.\u00a0</p><p>He has no idea whether it\u2019s just his imagination playing tricks on him or he just thinks that way about every guy around Y/N, but Eliot\u2019s been extra nice to her compared to how he treats others. This guy would always make eye-contact with only her when he speaks, only ask if she\u2019d like some more water (as if nobody else drank water besides Y/N)! Then he would find some lame excuse to touch her in some ways, either it\u2019s a supposedly\u00a0\u2018<i>friendly</i>\u2019 hug or him brushing his fingers against her arm during a conversation. Harry\u2019s not usually short-temper, but tonight he has to tolerate a lot!</p><p>He\u2019s told her about it, but she shrugged it off as always, telling him that he worries too much. How can she blame him? He has a solid reason to worry. He knows what Eliot wants by the look on his face because, before Y/N, Harry himself used to look at the other pretty girls just like that. His instinct is never wrong.</p><p>As the group walk back to their cars parked a few blocks away, Harry has his arms secured around his girl\u2019s shoulders and doesn\u2019t let go for even one second. It\u2019s apparent enough for everyone else, but he just doesn\u2019t see why Eliot cannot stop coming for Y/N. Maybe the guy is\u00a0not <i>perfect</i>, after all.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t follow Dr. Friedrich\u2019s lectures! Those concepts are so hard to grasp,\u201d Eliot complains while looking at Y/N, who\u2019s just awfully sweet as always (sometimes Harry hates how nice she is, ironically that what made him fall in love with her in the first place).<br></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand anything Niall and I can help.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, leave Nialler out of this please. All I did was sleep in that class,\u201d Niall\u2019s response makes Layla snort.<br></p><p>\u201cThen I think you\u2019re my only hope now, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an easy course,\u201d Harry speaks up all of a sudden, watching in amusement as Eliot\u2019s expression hardens.\u00a0\u201cI mean,\u00a0I don\u2019t even need to attend those classes to understand what\u2019s in the text-book.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI find it more challenging to learn something entirely in English.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cReally? Did you get your scholarship by doing an entrance exam in French?\u201d</p><p>Niall hurriedly steps in between the guys, holding up his hands in the air as he tells them both to chill.\u00a0\u201cAre you guys seriously gonna fight over a university course?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting for\u00a0Y/N, actually,\u201d Layla corrects and all eyes are on her.\u00a0Y/N looks utterly confused and surprised, but ironically now neither of those two guys pays attention to her.</p><p>\u201cI was speaking to Y/N, do you know how rude it is to interrupt people, Harold?\u201d Eliot asks with a smirk, clearly starting a war for saying so, and Harry\u2019s just so fed up right now.<br></p><p>\u201cDo you know how rude it is to flirt with someone\u2019s girlfriend right in front of them?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot when your girl is thirsty for a bit of my attention.\u201d<br></p><p>Just as Eliot finishes that sentence, Harry\u2019s fist knocks him onto the ground! Y/N and Niall have to hold Harry back from causing more damage to the other guy\u2019s face, and if it\u2019s not for them, Eliot would probably end up in the hospital for what he said.</p><p>\u201cHarry, leave him!\u201d Y/N tugs on her boyfriend\u2019s arm and looks worriedly at Eliot sitting on the ground, painfully cupping his bruised eye. She\u2019s not worried for him, she\u2019s worried for Harry, if his fans know Harry did that to him, she\u2019s afraid something bad would happen. But Harry doesn\u2019t seem to give a damn, he\u00a0turns to Y/N, asks if she\u2019s alright then tells her he\u2019ll take her home.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking filming this?\u201d Eliot asks as he sees Layla pointing her phone at him.\u00a0</p><p>She gives him a smirk.\u00a0\u201cThe new viral star getting punched in the face for being an asshole, <i>that,</i> I would pay to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, handsome. If I had to pick between you and Harry, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d Layla puts her phone away and walks off, leaving Harry and Y/N shocked as hell. Niall, on the other hand, looks particularly impressed as he\u00a0hurries up to catch up with Layla.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d Harry finally dares to question when he follows Y/N into their shared flat. She throws her bag onto the couch as well as herself before turning her head to him.<br></p><p>\u201cNot at you, at myself!\u201d she answers.<br></p><p>Harry takes a seat next to his girlfriend then asks her why she said that when she didn\u2019t even do anything wrong, it was him who punched someone in the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so easy to be taken advantage of! It seems like everyone\u2019s an asshole to me and I just let them!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, he kind of had Layla and Niall fooled too.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot just him. Everyone! And every time you warned me about it, I just completely ignored, now I\u2019ve got you in trouble! How can you walk around campus tomorrow if Eliot tells his fans you hurt him?\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles at her facial expression.\u00a0\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t even show up at school to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously making a joke right now?\u201d<br></p><p>Harry laughs as he apologizes and lies down on the sofa with his head on her lap like a little boy. Sometimes it\u2019s still overwhelming for Y/N that Harry can just go from the guy who\u2019s willing to punch anyone he dislikes, to the guy who lets her paint his nail and cries while watching rom-com, and it makes her feels like the luckiest for she\u2019s the only person who gets to see the soft side of him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for looking out for me,\u201d\u00a0she breaks the silence between the two of them after a while, fingers gently running through his dark locks.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing that ever since we met, I know you don\u2019t have to, but you do it all the time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t have to? You\u2019re a baby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSaid the one lying on my lap so I can stroke his hair.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m gonna let you win this time, only because I\u2019m enjoying this.\u201d\u00a0Harry closes his eyes and chuckles when Y/N leans down to kiss him on the cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to learn not to trust everyone you meet, for when I\u2019m not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have to make sure you\u2019ll always be around,\u201d she tells him, her eyes flicker with joy, but\u00a0Harry doesn\u2019t say anything back.</p><p>He just hopes she doesn\u2019t notice how his smile slowly fades away.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Y/N wakes up way too early the next morning because of Harry\u2019s alarm. Somehow he never wakes up before 9 o\u2019clock but always has his alarm set at 6 AM.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\u2019s still deep in his sleep to be bothered by that annoying sound. He has one arm locked around her waist, both of them naked, tangled up under the wrinkled sheet as a result of their crazy night.\u00a0</p><p>Careful not to wake Harry, Y/N reaches over him to grab his phone on the bedside table on his side. She turns the alarm off, then it hits her like a train when she sees multiple notifications on his locked screen, all tagging and mentioning him in an Instagram post. Quickly, she grabs her own phone to check if she\u2019s received any notification as well; and she has.\u00a0</p><p>Apparently, Layla wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she would post that video.</p><p>\u201cHarry, wake up!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry groans and buries his face into his pillow, but Y/N shakes his shoulders even harder.<br></p><p>\u201cWake up! Harry, you\u2019re famous!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, Layla posted the video!\u201d<br></p><p>Harry immediately sits up straight and his eyes bug out when he looks at the screen of his phone. <i>Holy fuck, Layla!</i></p><p>\u201cUgh look at these angry people. Eliot\u2019s so canceled.\u201d Y/N cringes when she scrolls down the comment section on the clip.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, look at all these girls calling me hot, I guess I don\u2019t mind being famous.\u201d Harry gives Y/N a toothy grin only to have his girlfriend skew up her face at him.<br></p><p>\u201cNot funny!\u201d She curls her lips.\u00a0\u201cWell, but at least they\u2019re in love with you not hating on you so I think that\u2019s good.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAww, look at you being supportive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry laughs and goes ahead to check the rest of the notifications. That\u2019s when he realizes how lucky he is that Y/N hasn\u2019t seen all of them, because there\u2019s a new message from Niall earlier this morning, which would get him in so much trouble if she was to find out.</p><ul><li><i>Congrats on that internship!

It&rsquo;s 2018 now and obviously everyone prefers social media than real life interactions, that&rsquo;s fine by him. However, today as he&rsquo;s walking to his favorite food court on campus to meet his friends for lunch, Harry finds it unusual as almost everyone he passes by are watching the same video on their devices. In fact, now he has the audio stuck inside his head and he hasn&rsquo;t even watched that viral clip yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Is this the part where everyone turns into zombies and he has to save the world on his own?</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with everybody today?&rdquo; Harry asks the girl friend next to him while scanning his eyes around the room.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, some guy posted a clip of himself playing instruments and now the whole school is obsessed,&rdquo; she replies, making him&nbsp;furrow his eyebrows in confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so special with that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fact that he plays 90 instruments and can sing very well,&rdquo; the girl says then shows Harry the clip on her phone.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a three minute cover of the song God Is A Woman by Ariana Grande, played by 90 instruments, and it was creatively arranged. Harry&rsquo;s got to admit this guy is talented.</p><p>&ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t understand all the hype for him, sure he&rsquo;s good but&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, honey, Lemme educate you real quick!&rdquo; The girl snaps her fingers as she clears her throat and sits up straight.&nbsp;&ldquo;This man is <i>anything</i> but ordinary, he recently moved here from France, he was very popular there because he won a national talent show,&nbsp;got here on a prestige scholarship, blessed with a&nbsp;look of a&nbsp;Greek God but like&hellip;French, and he plays all kinds of instruments you can think of, and&nbsp;has a voice of an angel, most importantly, he&rsquo;s an Aquarius, which is perfect for me!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry widens his eyes whilst his mouth falls open, unable to believe she just said all that in only one breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how you don&rsquo;t get it, he has zero, ZERO flaw!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who has zero flaw?&rdquo; Niall returns with his tray of food and joins his two friends at their table.</p><p>&ldquo;Layla&rsquo;s telling me about this new French guy everyone&rsquo;s obsessed about,&rdquo; Harry answers, holding the straw between his teeth, smirking like what he just said was most ridiculous thing ever.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;ve seen the clip then?&rdquo; Niall sits down in front of them and nods his head knowingly. &ldquo;Eliot Th&eacute;riault, we had a class together this morning, cool dude, he&rsquo;s hilarious.&rdquo;</p><p>Layla rests her chin on her knuckles and her elbows on the table. Her eyes twinkle with excitement. &ldquo;What class? I&rsquo;m gonna take it, gonna be his new &lsquo;study buddy&rsquo;, if you know what I mean.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, calm down woman,&rdquo; Niall chuckles before turning to Harry, who&rsquo;s cringing at Layla so hard. &ldquo;By the way, Y/N was in the same class with us, I think you should hold on to your girl, she&rsquo;s one of the victims, like Layla here.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh please, Y/N&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo; Harry snorts, but right after finishing that sentence, he hears his name being called from a few tables away. His girlfriend&rsquo;s walking fast towards them with that familiar big smile on her face, which alarms him that she&rsquo;s here with some news, it&rsquo;s either really great or just severely terrible. </p><p>&ldquo;I just met a Greek God, but he&rsquo;s French!&rdquo; Y/N announces once she stops at the table.</p><p>That is, apparently, all Layla has been waiting for just so she can shout out, &ldquo;see??? That&rsquo;s what I fuckin&rsquo; said!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry facepalms himself, while Niall bursts into laughter, and Y/N finds it amusing though it&rsquo;s not the first time she&rsquo;s seen these reactions from the two of them simultaneously. </p><p>She takes a seat next to Niall and reaches forward to pat her boyfriend gently on the cheek as a loving gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;C'mon, H, I had to fangirl a little bit,&rdquo; she reasons. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not every day that I&rsquo;ve got to sit in class next to a viral star!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I second that!&rdquo; Layla cuts in. &ldquo;But please stick to Harry so I have a shot with a hot guy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow, Layla!&rdquo; Y/N chuckles at the girl&rsquo;s statement. Most of Harry&rsquo;s friends are not very supportive of his relationship with Y/N since the two of them are poles apart, so to hear his friend say something like that is a whole new experience to Y/N.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make me your new best friend, princess.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How unfortunate.&rdquo; Y/N rolls her eyes in a sarcastic way, which makes Harry snigger. He likes how sassy she is sometimes, as a matter of fact, her eye-rolling never fails to turn him on.</p><p>&ldquo;Niall, have you told Harry?&rdquo; she suddenly asks. No matter what that news is, she sure looks very eager for her boyfriend to know.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right, Eliot has a live show tonight at a restaurant downtown, Y/N and I are invited but we&rsquo;re allowed to bring some friends.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna cancel my family dinner!&rdquo; Layla immediately unlocks her phone and stands up right away which surprises the other three at the table, &ldquo;mum, yeah, I cannot come tonight-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think she hasn&rsquo;t had sex in a while,&rdquo; Niall admits once his female friend is gone, then he asks Harry if he wants to come as well.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m good, I don&rsquo;t even know the guy so,&rdquo; Harry replies with a shrug, promptly given the look of doubt from his best friend and girlfriend.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You sure, mate? Because I think he&rsquo;s quite fond of Y/N.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Niall&rsquo;s assertion causes Harry to nearly choke on his water. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; he declares in less than no time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m definitely going.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Eliot is&hellip;<i>nice</i>. Harry was hoping he would be an asshole instead, but he looks&nbsp;exactly like the perfect human being his friends described, which makes him a lot more intimidating, because he could be faking his down-to-earth personality and nobody would know for how well he does it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That was great, mate!&rdquo; Niall compliments Eliot who just leaves the stage to another performer of the night.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Merci!</i> I&rsquo;m glad you guys enjoyed it!&rdquo; says Eliot in a thick French accent, and whilst Layla obviously swoons, Harry has to take a glance at Y/N to see her reaction. She has her usual smiley face on, but who knows what on earth she&rsquo;s actually thinking about.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t worry about dinner. My uncle&rsquo;s the owner of this restaurant. You don&rsquo;t have to pay.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Looks like I&rsquo;ve found my Christian Grey.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Damn it, Layla!&rdquo; Niall cries out as he throws his head back and everybody else laughs, except for Layla, who rolls her eyes in a sassy way and tells Niall to fuck off.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; Both Y/N and Harry flinch when her name is called. &ldquo;Did you like my performance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I love it, I think it&rsquo;s great, you&rsquo;re so talented.&rdquo; She sighs, holding both of her hands together.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Layla slightly nudges Harry, then leans over to whisper to him,&nbsp;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;re secretly plotting his death, you&nbsp;gotta be more discreet than that murderous look on your face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Harry says, though he cannot deny he&rsquo;s been giving Eliot the death stare ever since their first met, just&nbsp;to clarify that his Y/N is untouchable.&nbsp;</p><p>He has no idea whether it&rsquo;s just his imagination playing tricks on him or he just thinks that way about every guy around Y/N, but Eliot&rsquo;s been extra nice to her compared to how he treats others. This guy would always make eye-contact with only her when he speaks, only ask if she&rsquo;d like some more water (as if nobody else drank water besides Y/N)! Then he would find some lame excuse to touch her in some ways, either it&rsquo;s a supposedly&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>friendly</i>&rsquo; hug or him brushing his fingers against her arm during a conversation. Harry&rsquo;s not usually short-temper, but tonight he has to tolerate a lot!</p><p>He&rsquo;s told her about it, but she shrugged it off as always, telling him that he worries too much. How can she blame him? He has a solid reason to worry. He knows what Eliot wants by the look on his face because, before Y/N, Harry himself used to look at the other pretty girls just like that. His instinct is never wrong.</p><p>As the group walk back to their cars parked a few blocks away, Harry has his arms secured around his girl&rsquo;s shoulders and doesn&rsquo;t let go for even one second. It&rsquo;s apparent enough for everyone else, but he just doesn&rsquo;t see why Eliot cannot stop coming for Y/N. Maybe the guy is&nbsp;not <i>perfect</i>, after all.</p><p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t follow Dr. Friedrich&rsquo;s lectures! Those concepts are so hard to grasp,&rdquo; Eliot complains while looking at Y/N, who&rsquo;s just awfully sweet as always (sometimes Harry hates how nice she is, ironically that what made him fall in love with her in the first place).<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand anything Niall and I can help.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, leave Nialler out of this please. All I did was sleep in that class,&rdquo; Niall&rsquo;s response makes Layla snort.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then I think you&rsquo;re my only hope now, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an easy course,&rdquo; Harry speaks up all of a sudden, watching in amusement as Eliot&rsquo;s expression hardens.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean,&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t even need to attend those classes to understand what&rsquo;s in the text-book.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I find it more challenging to learn something entirely in English.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Really? Did you get your scholarship by doing an entrance exam in French?&rdquo;</p><p>Niall hurriedly steps in between the guys, holding up his hands in the air as he tells them both to chill.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you guys seriously gonna fight over a university course?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fighting for&nbsp;Y/N, actually,&rdquo; Layla corrects and all eyes are on her.&nbsp;Y/N looks utterly confused and surprised, but ironically now neither of those two guys pays attention to her.</p><p>&ldquo;I was speaking to Y/N, do you know how rude it is to interrupt people, Harold?&rdquo; Eliot asks with a smirk, clearly starting a war for saying so, and Harry&rsquo;s just so fed up right now.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how rude it is to flirt with someone&rsquo;s girlfriend right in front of them?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not when your girl is thirsty for a bit of my attention.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Just as Eliot finishes that sentence, Harry&rsquo;s fist knocks him onto the ground! Y/N and Niall have to hold Harry back from causing more damage to the other guy&rsquo;s face, and if it&rsquo;s not for them, Eliot would probably end up in the hospital for what he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, leave him!&rdquo; Y/N tugs on her boyfriend&rsquo;s arm and looks worriedly at Eliot sitting on the ground, painfully cupping his bruised eye. She&rsquo;s not worried for him, she&rsquo;s worried for Harry, if his fans know Harry did that to him, she&rsquo;s afraid something bad would happen. But Harry doesn&rsquo;t seem to give a damn, he&nbsp;turns to Y/N, asks if she&rsquo;s alright then tells her he&rsquo;ll take her home.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you fucking filming this?&rdquo; Eliot asks as he sees Layla pointing her phone at him.&nbsp;</p><p>She gives him a smirk.&nbsp;&ldquo;The new viral star getting punched in the face for being an asshole, <i>that,</i> I would pay to watch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, handsome. If I had to pick between you and Harry, you wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance.&rdquo; Layla puts her phone away and walks off, leaving Harry and Y/N shocked as hell. Niall, on the other hand, looks particularly impressed as he&nbsp;hurries up to catch up with Layla.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you mad at me?&rdquo; Harry finally dares to question when he follows Y/N into their shared flat. She throws her bag onto the couch as well as herself before turning her head to him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not at you, at myself!&rdquo; she answers.<br /></p><p>Harry takes a seat next to his girlfriend then asks her why she said that when she didn&rsquo;t even do anything wrong, it was him who punched someone in the face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so easy to be taken advantage of! It seems like everyone&rsquo;s an asshole to me and I just let them!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, he kind of had Layla and Niall fooled too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not just him. Everyone! And every time you warned me about it, I just completely ignored, now I&rsquo;ve got you in trouble! How can you walk around campus tomorrow if Eliot tells his fans you hurt him?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry chuckles at her facial expression.&nbsp;&ldquo;Baby, I don&rsquo;t even show up at school to begin with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you seriously making a joke right now?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry laughs as he apologizes and lies down on the sofa with his head on her lap like a little boy.

Harry, you&rsquo;re famous!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nice try.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m serious, Layla posted the video!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry immediately sits up straight and his eyes bug out when he looks at the screen of his phone. <i>Holy fuck, Layla!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh look at these angry people. Eliot&rsquo;s so canceled.&rdquo; Y/N cringes when she scrolls down the comment section on the clip.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, look at all these girls calling me hot, I guess I don&rsquo;t mind being famous.&rdquo; Harry gives Y/N a toothy grin only to have his girlfriend skew up her face at him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not funny!&rdquo; She curls her lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, but at least they&rsquo;re in love with you not hating on you so I think that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aww, look at you being supportive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Harry laughs and goes ahead to check the rest of the notifications.

Es el artista masculino con m&aacute;s ventas de discos deb&uacute;t, su single <i>Sign of the Times</i> derrib&oacute; al conocido <i>Shape of You</i> del primer lugar en reproducci&oacute;n mundial tras 17 minutos de salir al p&uacute;blico (venciendo a Adel, con 21 minutos).
