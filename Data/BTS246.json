The sun was setting, causing the room to be filled with orange and yellow colors, making the atmosphere feel cozy and relaxing. They often visited Jimin at his dance practices, Naji loved to watch him dance almost as much as she loved dancing with him</p><p>Growing up with the boys shaped her every single day. Thanks to Jin, she loved cooking and spent most times of their visits in his restaurant\u2019s kitchen to learn whatever she could. Hoseok made her fall in love with gardening and always helped him with his flower shop. Jungkook made her look forward to go to school because he always showed her that <i>school can be fun too, even if the other kids are meanies. </i>Taehyung made her appreciate good clothing and she always wanted to visit him at his studio in his dorm to watch him create a new piece of clothing from scratch. Namjoon made her love philosophy and his students absolutely loved her. Yoongi always managed to impress her with his skills at writing lyrics and creating songs. And Jimin.. Well, Jimin made her dance. He made her fall in love with it, as he did with everyone. He was mesmerizing when he danced, and she wanted to be just like that</p><p>She was looking at him with a soft smile on her lips, a smile Yoongi knew all too well. Something was on her mind. Was it about the dancing? Jimin started teaching her two years ago and she loved it. But now she seemed immersed in her thoughts, not paying attention to the young dancer in front of her. It was the first time he saw her not being completely focused on him as if there was nothing else in the whole world</p><p>Taehyung was sitting on the floor drawing something in his sketchbook, his dark brown hair falling over his eyes as he kept looking at the big piece of paper. He usually went to visit his friend too, since his university was pretty close to Jimin\u2019s, and seeing him dancing was a great source of inspiration. Especially on those days when he felt down and unmotivated, Jimin always helped, even with just a smile or a silly joke or humming a song. As he kept scribbling, Naji\u2019s voice filled the room</p><p>\u201cWhere is mom?\u201d</p><p>Her voice shouldn\u2019t be heard so clearly under all the little noises, but it did. It reached all four of them as if she made the question directly into their ears, at full volume. Jimin stopped dancing. Tae\u2019s pencil froze but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off of his sketchbook. Yoongi\u2019s breath stuck in his throat and he looked at Namjoon who slowly put his book down. There was music playing, and rain hitting the windows, and cars passing by, but the room felt awfully quiet, and the silence was crushing them one by one</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTae\u201d Jimin stopped him \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d</p><p>Naji seemed confused as she looked at Taehyung asking him with her eyes what was wrong. And after so many years, he felt the same as back then. He felt his throat getting sore, the air getting thin, his eyes burning threatening to be filled with tears again. And suddenly the room wasn\u2019t warm and cozy anymore, it wasn\u2019t comfortable and happy, it was cold and grey and unbearable. He stood up and got out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Naji gasped softly at the sudden, loud sound and looked over at Jimin who sighed and gave an apologetic look to his friends. He whispered a soft <i>I\u2019m sorry </i>before leaving the room too, probably trying to find his friend, Namjoon thought.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t this too early? Was she ready to know? How were they going to tell her? She was ten; she wasn\u2019t supposed to ask something like that yet. Or was she? He couldn\u2019t be sure. The little girl looked at her dads with eyes filled with sadness and worry</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she whispered \u201cI didn\u2019t know they don\u2019t like her\u201d</p><p>Namjoon invited her in his arms and she climbed on the couch and hugged him. Yoongi took a sip of his coffee wishing it was something stronger. He had no idea what her reaction would be, but he prepared himself for a bad one</p><p>***</p><p>Jimin ran in the hallway until he reached Taehyung who was just hiding into an empty room. He got in and locked the door behind them. The room was old and the smell of mold filled their noses, making Jimin cough a bit. Taehyung was sitting on the cold floor, his back against the wall. He locked eyes with Jimin and they let the silence sink in for a bit. Jimin had to bite the inside of his cheeks to keep a neutral expression and not let his best friend\u2019s pained stare break him again. Jimin hated seeing any of them in pain; he hated it more than he hated pain itself. He sighed and tried to approach Taehyung, but he didn\u2019t let him</p><p>\u201cTae\u201d he said softly \u201cHoney. You have to move on\u201d</p><p>He looked at him and his tears escaped his eyes \u201cMove on?\u201d he asked \u201cMove on?! Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae!\u201d Jimin almost yelled \u201cYou\u2019re not doing any good to any of us! We\u2019re all still in pain, we\u2019ll always be, but this is not helping. You have to move on. Not for me, not for Yoongi or Namjoon. You have to do it for yourself. And for Naji. She doesn\u2019t deserve this\u201d</p><p>Taehyung was shaking as he rubbed his eyes to get rid of the tears and took a deep breath</p><p>\u201cWhat are they gonna say, huh?\u201d he asked in his deep voice that sent shivers down Jimin\u2019s spine \u201cIf they tell her the truth, she\u2019s going to hate me. If they lie to her, she\u2019s going to hate them. Do you really think they are going to make their daughter hate them?\u201d</p><p>Jimin pinched the bridge of his nose \u201cShe\u2019s not going to hate anyone Tae, it\u2019s Naji we\u2019re talking about. You know her, she loves you to pieces, she would never-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate me\u201d he interrupted \u201cIf she finds out I am the reason her mom isn\u2019t here, she <i>is </i>going to hate me. Every child would\u201d</p><p>Jimin looked at him seemingly calm, but Taehyung knew his soulmate. He was angry. Very much so. He could see it in his bright brown eyes, under his beautiful orange hair</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking as if she doesn\u2019t have parents\u201d Taehyung sighed and looked down, \u201cYou think they\u2019re not good enough for her? You think that she is not okay with them and that she\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI just think that every kid should be with their mother\u201d he interrupted him again</p><p>Jimin pursed his lips \u201cBut this world isn\u2019t perfect, you asshole\u201d Tae\u2019s words might seem not so deep to someone else, but Jimin knew. He had learned how to decipher every word of his and how to see behind everything he said as if everything had a double meaning</p><p>\u201cOh I know\u201d he replied annoyed \u201cBelieve me, I know that very well\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you know it, that\u2019s why I thought you\u2019d understand\u201d he stepped closer to him raising his voice in the process<i> </i>\u201cIf you\u2019ve learned <i>anything at all </i>that day, fucking act like it god damn it. I know it was shit, I know you\u2019re in pain\u201d his voice dropped and became softer again \u201cI know you still cry before you fall asleep, I know it\u2019s still eating you alive\u201d he walked to him and patted his hair \u201cBut let it go. Please. You can\u2019t do anything to change what happened, but you can change what your life will be like. She made sure for you to be here today, will you let that go to waste?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked at him for some seconds that seemed never-ending, before hugging him tightly</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said and his voice cracked under his tears \u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>Jimin smiled \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for calling you an asshole, I didn\u2019t mean it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really know that she\u2019s fine with them, and I know they\u2019re great parents, the best that she could have. But-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know hun\u201d he patted his back \u201cI know\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYour mom was a superhero\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up and she gasped excited \u201cA superhero?!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cLike in the books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Namjoon confirmed \u201cExactly like that. She saved many people\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? From what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fought against fire,\u201d Yoongi said with a fond smile \u201cShe wasn\u2019t afraid of it. If anyone was in danger, she was there to make sure they were safe. She was the strongest superhero. And she was our best friend\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend? Like I am friends with the kids at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend like you\u2019re friends with Kookie, honey\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good\u201d Namjoon took a deep breath \u201cShe was older than us, she helped us through some very difficult times and almost raised the little ones. Your dad met her when they were still kids. We grew up together. She left for a few years but she came back to us, our lives were better when we were together\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Why did you take me?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon could feel Yoongi stiffen next to him, holding his cup of coffee a bit too tightly. He held his hand softly</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d she asked when she saw him being so serious</p><p>\u201cYou are with us because she knew that being a superhero was dangerous, so she made sure that if anything happened to her, you\u2019d have a family that would love you no matter what, forever\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem satisfied \u201cHow did she die?\u201d</p><p>How could a ten-year-old comprehend something like that? Yoongi thought. How could she ask something like that while understanding what she was about to hear?</p><p>\u201cThere was a fire at a school\u201d Namjoon started \u201cShe went there to save the kids, as always. But the building was old, so it started crumbling sooner than expected. She was almost done when a boy panicked and froze. He couldn\u2019t move, nor hear her instructions. She had to take him out of that building from the window, hurting his legs badly enough, but saving his life. She didn\u2019t have the time to do the same\u201d</p><p>She seemed fascinated \u201cMy mom was so cool\u201d was the only thing she said for a bit</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was\u201d Yoongi mumbled with a sad smile</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that boy?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jimin and Taehyung got out of the room at the same time Yoongi, Namjoon, and Naji did. All of them stayed still at the sight of each other. Taehyung\u2019s eyes and nose were swollen and red from crying. He looked at them in fear and he could feel his heart drop to his stomach as he saw Naji staring at him with her beautiful eyes.

The sun was setting, causing the room to be filled with orange and yellow colors, making the atmosphere feel cozy and relaxing. They often visited Jimin at his dance practices, Naji loved to watch him dance almost as much as she loved dancing with him</p><p>Growing up with the boys shaped her every single day. Thanks to Jin, she loved cooking and spent most times of their visits in his restaurant\u2019s kitchen to learn whatever she could. Hoseok made her fall in love with gardening and always helped him with his flower shop. Jungkook made her look forward to go to school because he always showed her that <i>school can be fun too, even if the other kids are meanies. </i>Taehyung made her appreciate good clothing and she always wanted to visit him at his studio in his dorm to watch him create a new piece of clothing from scratch. Namjoon made her love philosophy and his students absolutely loved her. Yoongi always managed to impress her with his skills at writing lyrics and creating songs. And Jimin.. Well, Jimin made her dance. He made her fall in love with it, as he did with everyone. He was mesmerizing when he danced, and she wanted to be just like that</p><p>She was looking at him with a soft smile on her lips, a smile Yoongi knew all too well. Something was on her mind. Was it about the dancing? Jimin started teaching her two years ago and she loved it. But now she seemed immersed in her thoughts, not paying attention to the young dancer in front of her. It was the first time he saw her not being completely focused on him as if there was nothing else in the whole world</p><p>Taehyung was sitting on the floor drawing something in his sketchbook, his dark brown hair falling over his eyes as he kept looking at the big piece of paper. He usually went to visit his friend too, since his university was pretty close to Jimin\u2019s, and seeing him dancing was a great source of inspiration. Especially on those days when he felt down and unmotivated, Jimin always helped, even with just a smile or a silly joke or humming a song. As he kept scribbling, Naji\u2019s voice filled the room</p><p>\u201cWhere is mom?\u201d</p><p>Her voice shouldn\u2019t be heard so clearly under all the little noises, but it did. It reached all four of them as if she made the question directly into their ears, at full volume. Jimin stopped dancing. Tae\u2019s pencil froze but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off of his sketchbook. Yoongi\u2019s breath stuck in his throat and he looked at Namjoon who slowly put his book down. There was music playing, and rain hitting the windows, and cars passing by, but the room felt awfully quiet, and the silence was crushing them one by one</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTae\u201d Jimin stopped him \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d</p><p>Naji seemed confused as she looked at Taehyung asking him with her eyes what was wrong. And after so many years, he felt the same as back then. He felt his throat getting sore, the air getting thin, his eyes burning threatening to be filled with tears again. And suddenly the room wasn\u2019t warm and cozy anymore, it wasn\u2019t comfortable and happy, it was cold and grey and unbearable. He stood up and got out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Naji gasped softly at the sudden, loud sound and looked over at Jimin who sighed and gave an apologetic look to his friends. He whispered a soft <i>I\u2019m sorry </i>before leaving the room too, probably trying to find his friend, Namjoon thought.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t this too early? Was she ready to know? How were they going to tell her? She was ten; she wasn\u2019t supposed to ask something like that yet. Or was she? He couldn\u2019t be sure. The little girl looked at her dads with eyes filled with sadness and worry</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she whispered \u201cI didn\u2019t know they don\u2019t like her\u201d</p><p>Namjoon invited her in his arms and she climbed on the couch and hugged him. Yoongi took a sip of his coffee wishing it was something stronger. He had no idea what her reaction would be, but he prepared himself for a bad one</p><p>***</p><p>Jimin ran in the hallway until he reached Taehyung who was just hiding into an empty room. He got in and locked the door behind them. The room was old and the smell of mold filled their noses, making Jimin cough a bit. Taehyung was sitting on the cold floor, his back against the wall. He locked eyes with Jimin and they let the silence sink in for a bit. Jimin had to bite the inside of his cheeks to keep a neutral expression and not let his best friend\u2019s pained stare break him again. Jimin hated seeing any of them in pain; he hated it more than he hated pain itself. He sighed and tried to approach Taehyung, but he didn\u2019t let him</p><p>\u201cTae\u201d he said softly \u201cHoney. You have to move on\u201d</p><p>He looked at him and his tears escaped his eyes \u201cMove on?\u201d he asked \u201cMove on?! Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTae!\u201d Jimin almost yelled \u201cYou\u2019re not doing any good to any of us! We\u2019re all still in pain, we\u2019ll always be, but this is not helping. You have to move on. Not for me, not for Yoongi or Namjoon. You have to do it for yourself. And for Naji. She doesn\u2019t deserve this\u201d</p><p>Taehyung was shaking as he rubbed his eyes to get rid of the tears and took a deep breath</p><p>\u201cWhat are they gonna say, huh?\u201d he asked in his deep voice that sent shivers down Jimin\u2019s spine \u201cIf they tell her the truth, she\u2019s going to hate me. If they lie to her, she\u2019s going to hate them. Do you really think they are going to make their daughter hate them?\u201d</p><p>Jimin pinched the bridge of his nose \u201cShe\u2019s not going to hate anyone Tae, it\u2019s Naji we\u2019re talking about. You know her, she loves you to pieces, she would never-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate me\u201d he interrupted \u201cIf she finds out I am the reason her mom isn\u2019t here, she <i>is </i>going to hate me. Every child would\u201d</p><p>Jimin looked at him seemingly calm, but Taehyung knew his soulmate. He was angry. Very much so. He could see it in his bright brown eyes, under his beautiful orange hair</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking as if she doesn\u2019t have parents\u201d Taehyung sighed and looked down, \u201cYou think they\u2019re not good enough for her? You think that she is not okay with them and that she\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI just think that every kid should be with their mother\u201d he interrupted him again</p><p>Jimin pursed his lips \u201cBut this world isn\u2019t perfect, you asshole\u201d Tae\u2019s words might seem not so deep to someone else, but Jimin knew. He had learned how to decipher every word of his and how to see behind everything he said as if everything had a double meaning</p><p>\u201cOh I know\u201d he replied annoyed \u201cBelieve me, I know that very well\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you know it, that\u2019s why I thought you\u2019d understand\u201d he stepped closer to him raising his voice in the process<i> </i>\u201cIf you\u2019ve learned <i>anything at all </i>that day, fucking act like it god damn it. I know it was shit, I know you\u2019re in pain\u201d his voice dropped and became softer again \u201cI know you still cry before you fall asleep, I know it\u2019s still eating you alive\u201d he walked to him and patted his hair \u201cBut let it go. Please. You can\u2019t do anything to change what happened, but you can change what your life will be like. She made sure for you to be here today, will you let that go to waste?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked at him for some seconds that seemed never-ending, before hugging him tightly</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said and his voice cracked under his tears \u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>Jimin smiled \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for calling you an asshole, I didn\u2019t mean it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really know that she\u2019s fine with them, and I know they\u2019re great parents, the best that she could have. But-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know hun\u201d he patted his back \u201cI know\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYour mom was a superhero\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up and she gasped excited \u201cA superhero?!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cLike in the books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Namjoon confirmed \u201cExactly like that. She saved many people\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? From what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fought against fire,\u201d Yoongi said with a fond smile \u201cShe wasn\u2019t afraid of it. If anyone was in danger, she was there to make sure they were safe. She was the strongest superhero. And she was our best friend\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend? Like I am friends with the kids at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend like you\u2019re friends with Kookie, honey\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good\u201d Namjoon took a deep breath \u201cShe was older than us, she helped us through some very difficult times and almost raised the little ones. Your dad met her when they were still kids. We grew up together. She left for a few years but she came back to us, our lives were better when we were together\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Why did you take me?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon could feel Yoongi stiffen next to him, holding his cup of coffee a bit too tightly. He held his hand softly</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d she asked when she saw him being so serious</p><p>\u201cYou are with us because she knew that being a superhero was dangerous, so she made sure that if anything happened to her, you\u2019d have a family that would love you no matter what, forever\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem satisfied \u201cHow did she die?\u201d</p><p>How could a ten-year-old comprehend something like that? Yoongi thought. How could she ask something like that while understanding what she was about to hear?</p><p>\u201cThere was a fire at a school\u201d Namjoon started \u201cShe went there to save the kids, as always. But the building was old, so it started crumbling sooner than expected. She was almost done when a boy panicked and froze. He couldn\u2019t move, nor hear her instructions. She had to take him out of that building from the window, hurting his legs badly enough, but saving his life. She didn\u2019t have the time to do the same\u201d</p><p>She seemed fascinated \u201cMy mom was so cool\u201d was the only thing she said for a bit</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was\u201d Yoongi mumbled with a sad smile</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that boy?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jimin and Taehyung got out of the room at the same time Yoongi, Namjoon, and Naji did. All of them stayed still at the sight of each other. Taehyung\u2019s eyes and nose were swollen and red from crying. He looked at them in fear and he could feel his heart drop to his stomach as he saw Naji staring at him with her beautiful eyes. She ran towards him and he kneeled when she opened her arms to give him a hug. She landed on him with some tears streaming down her cheeks, as Taehyung could feel his own eyes getting watery again. He held her close to him and when she took a step back she tried to get rid of her tears</p><p>\u201cDo your legs hurt?\u201d she asked in a shaky voice</p><p>He laughed from relief and took her hair out of her face \u201cNo. No, they don\u2019t hurt anymore\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u201d she sniffed a bit more before continuing \u201cTae\u201d she tried to talk again \u201cI promise I\u2019m not mad\u201d that made him drop his eyes and placing his forehead on her tiny shoulder as she ran her hands through his hair \u201cAnd she is not mad either.

He had learned how to decipher every word of his and how to see behind everything he said as if everything had a double meaning</p><p>\u201cOh I know\u201d he replied annoyed \u201cBelieve me, I know that very well\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you know it, that\u2019s why I thought you\u2019d understand\u201d he stepped closer to him raising his voice in the process<i> </i>\u201cIf you\u2019ve learned <i>anything at all </i>that day, fucking act like it god damn it. I know it was shit, I know you\u2019re in pain\u201d his voice dropped and became softer again \u201cI know you still cry before you fall asleep, I know it\u2019s still eating you alive\u201d he walked to him and patted his hair \u201cBut let it go. Please. You can\u2019t do anything to change what happened, but you can change what your life will be like. She made sure for you to be here today, will you let that go to waste?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked at him for some seconds that seemed never-ending, before hugging him tightly</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said and his voice cracked under his tears \u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>Jimin smiled \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for calling you an asshole, I didn\u2019t mean it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really know that she\u2019s fine with them, and I know they\u2019re great parents, the best that she could have.

She saved many people\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? From what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fought against fire,\u201d Yoongi said with a fond smile \u201cShe wasn\u2019t afraid of it. If anyone was in danger, she was there to make sure they were safe. She was the strongest superhero. And she was our best friend\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend? Like I am friends with the kids at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend like you\u2019re friends with Kookie, honey\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good\u201d Namjoon took a deep breath \u201cShe was older than us, she helped us through some very difficult times and almost raised the little ones.

Why did you take me?\u201d</p><p>Namjoon could feel Yoongi stiffen next to him, holding his cup of coffee a bit too tightly. He held his hand softly</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d she asked when she saw him being so serious</p><p>\u201cYou are with us because she knew that being a superhero was dangerous, so she made sure that if anything happened to her, you\u2019d have a family that would love you no matter what, forever\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem satisfied \u201cHow did she die?\u201d</p><p>How could a ten-year-old comprehend something like that? Yoongi thought. How could she ask something like that while understanding what she was about to hear?</p><p>\u201cThere was a fire at a school\u201d Namjoon started \u201cShe went there to save the kids, as always. But the building was old, so it started crumbling sooner than expected. She was almost done when a boy panicked and froze. He couldn\u2019t move, nor hear her instructions. She had to take him out of that building from the window, hurting his legs badly enough, but saving his life. She didn\u2019t have the time to do the same\u201d</p><p>She seemed fascinated \u201cMy mom was so cool\u201d was the only thing she said for a bit</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was\u201d Yoongi mumbled with a sad smile</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that boy?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jimin and Taehyung got out of the room at the same time Yoongi, Namjoon, and Naji did. All of them stayed still at the sight of each other. Taehyung\u2019s eyes and nose were swollen and red from crying. He looked at them in fear and he could feel his heart drop to his stomach as he saw Naji staring at him with her beautiful eyes. She ran towards him and he kneeled when she opened her arms to give him a hug. She landed on him with some tears streaming down her cheeks, as Taehyung could feel his own eyes getting watery again. He held her close to him and when she took a step back she tried to get rid of her tears</p><p>\u201cDo your legs hurt?\u201d she asked in a shaky voice</p><p>He laughed from relief and took her hair out of her face \u201cNo. No, they don\u2019t hurt anymore\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u201d she sniffed a bit more before continuing \u201cTae\u201d she tried to talk again \u201cI promise I\u2019m not mad\u201d that made him drop his eyes and placing his forehead on her tiny shoulder as she ran her hands through his hair \u201cAnd she is not mad either. She did it because she loved you so much and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d do it again. It\u2019s okay, I promise\u201d</p><p>Taehyung could never describe the feeling he got that day. Almost like a brick leaving his chest. Because she was the only one who could forgive him. She was the only one who could help him move on. And she did.</p></p>",

The sun was setting, causing the room to be filled with orange and yellow colors, making the atmosphere feel cozy and relaxing. They often visited Jimin at his dance practices, Naji loved to watch him dance almost as much as she loved dancing with him</p><p>Growing up with the boys shaped her every single day. Thanks to Jin, she loved cooking and spent most times of their visits in his restaurant&rsquo;s kitchen to learn whatever she could. Hoseok made her fall in love with gardening and always helped him with his flower shop. Jungkook made her look forward to go to school because he always showed her that <i>school can be fun too, even if the other kids are meanies. </i>Taehyung made her appreciate good clothing and she always wanted to visit him at his studio in his dorm to watch him create a new piece of clothing from scratch. Namjoon made her love philosophy and his students absolutely loved her. Yoongi always managed to impress her with his skills at writing lyrics and creating songs. And Jimin.. Well, Jimin made her dance. He made her fall in love with it, as he did with everyone. He was mesmerizing when he danced, and she wanted to be just like that</p><p>She was looking at him with a soft smile on her lips, a smile Yoongi knew all too well. Something was on her mind. Was it about the dancing? Jimin started teaching her two years ago and she loved it. But now she seemed immersed in her thoughts, not paying attention to the young dancer in front of her. It was the first time he saw her not being completely focused on him as if there was nothing else in the whole world</p><p>Taehyung was sitting on the floor drawing something in his sketchbook, his dark brown hair falling over his eyes as he kept looking at the big piece of paper. He usually went to visit his friend too, since his university was pretty close to Jimin&rsquo;s, and seeing him dancing was a great source of inspiration. Especially on those days when he felt down and unmotivated, Jimin always helped, even with just a smile or a silly joke or humming a song. As he kept scribbling, Naji&rsquo;s voice filled the room</p><p>&ldquo;Where is mom?&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice shouldn&rsquo;t be heard so clearly under all the little noises, but it did. It reached all four of them as if she made the question directly into their ears, at full volume. Jimin stopped dancing. Tae&rsquo;s pencil froze but he didn&rsquo;t take his eyes off of his sketchbook. Yoongi&rsquo;s breath stuck in his throat and he looked at Namjoon who slowly put his book down. There was music playing, and rain hitting the windows, and cars passing by, but the room felt awfully quiet, and the silence was crushing them one by one</p><p>&ldquo;What did she say-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tae&rdquo; Jimin stopped him &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p><p>Naji seemed confused as she looked at Taehyung asking him with her eyes what was wrong. And after so many years, he felt the same as back then. He felt his throat getting sore, the air getting thin, his eyes burning threatening to be filled with tears again. And suddenly the room wasn&rsquo;t warm and cozy anymore, it wasn&rsquo;t comfortable and happy, it was cold and grey and unbearable. He stood up and got out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Naji gasped softly at the sudden, loud sound and looked over at Jimin who sighed and gave an apologetic look to his friends. He whispered a soft <i>I&rsquo;m sorry </i>before leaving the room too, probably trying to find his friend, Namjoon thought.</p><p>Wasn&rsquo;t this too early? Was she ready to know? How were they going to tell her? She was ten; she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to ask something like that yet. Or was she? He couldn&rsquo;t be sure. The little girl looked at her dads with eyes filled with sadness and worry</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; she whispered &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they don&rsquo;t like her&rdquo;</p><p>Namjoon invited her in his arms and she climbed on the couch and hugged him. Yoongi took a sip of his coffee wishing it was something stronger. He had no idea what her reaction would be, but he prepared himself for a bad one</p><p>***</p><p>Jimin ran in the hallway until he reached Taehyung who was just hiding into an empty room. He got in and locked the door behind them. The room was old and the smell of mold filled their noses, making Jimin cough a bit. Taehyung was sitting on the cold floor, his back against the wall. He locked eyes with Jimin and they let the silence sink in for a bit. Jimin had to bite the inside of his cheeks to keep a neutral expression and not let his best friend&rsquo;s pained stare break him again. Jimin hated seeing any of them in pain; he hated it more than he hated pain itself. He sighed and tried to approach Taehyung, but he didn&rsquo;t let him</p><p>&ldquo;Tae&rdquo; he said softly &ldquo;Honey. You have to move on&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at him and his tears escaped his eyes &ldquo;Move on?&rdquo; he asked &ldquo;Move on?! Are you kidding me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tae!&rdquo; Jimin almost yelled &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not doing any good to any of us! We&rsquo;re all still in pain, we&rsquo;ll always be, but this is not helping. You have to move on. Not for me, not for Yoongi or Namjoon. You have to do it for yourself. And for Naji. She doesn&rsquo;t deserve this&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung was shaking as he rubbed his eyes to get rid of the tears and took a deep breath</p><p>&ldquo;What are they gonna say, huh?&rdquo; he asked in his deep voice that sent shivers down Jimin&rsquo;s spine &ldquo;If they tell her the truth, she&rsquo;s going to hate me. If they lie to her, she&rsquo;s going to hate them. Do you really think they are going to make their daughter hate them?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin pinched the bridge of his nose &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to hate anyone Tae, it&rsquo;s Naji we&rsquo;re talking about. You know her, she loves you to pieces, she would never-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate me&rdquo; he interrupted &ldquo;If she finds out I am the reason her mom isn&rsquo;t here, she <i>is </i>going to hate me. Every child would&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin looked at him seemingly calm, but Taehyung knew his soulmate. He was angry. Very much so. He could see it in his bright brown eyes, under his beautiful orange hair</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking as if she doesn&rsquo;t have parents&rdquo; Taehyung sighed and looked down, &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;re not good enough for her? You think that she is not okay with them and that she&rsquo;s-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just think that every kid should be with their mother&rdquo; he interrupted him again</p><p>Jimin pursed his lips &ldquo;But this world isn&rsquo;t perfect, you asshole&rdquo; Tae&rsquo;s words might seem not so deep to someone else, but Jimin knew. He had learned how to decipher every word of his and how to see behind everything he said as if everything had a double meaning</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I know&rdquo; he replied annoyed &ldquo;Believe me, I know that very well&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you know it, that&rsquo;s why I thought you&rsquo;d understand&rdquo; he stepped closer to him raising his voice in the process<i> </i>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve learned <i>anything at all </i>that day, fucking act like it god damn it.

I don\u2019t know.</i></p><p>\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have feeling for each other anymore.

We can fix this? Y/n, can\u2019t you see, there is nothing to fix, because there\u2019s nothing broken, there\u2019s nothing wrong with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why? Why are <i>we</i> not working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop it now, or else, we will just continue to hurt each other.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi gave you that one last comforting hug. You didn\u2019t notice how much you miss him before you feel tear drops wetting your neck. Yoongi unlocked the door. You didn\u2019t stop him, funny how you\u2019re the one talking about doing this forever literally a second ago. Yoongi slowly faded together with the closing door. You were just sitting on the couch, trying to stop yourself from crying but failed miserably.\u00a0</p><p><i>I love you, Min Yoongi.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>I</i>-\u201c</p><p>When you snapped out of your tears and you remembered you need to tell him something, you tried to chase him, hoping that he has not gone too far. And how relieved you are when you can still see him.</p><p><i>At least he needs to know this.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMin Yoongi!\u201d you shouted, several meters away. Your hands and legs are still shaking from the crying, but he needs to know at least, your real feelings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, thank you and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d You could see how his lips slowly curled up and created a smile after he heard those words. You know that smile, the first real smile after only god knows how long. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on the street, y/n. I\u2019ll still call your name, then.\u201d He turned around, walking away with his head up.</p><p>\u201cBy then, I\u2019ll still call your name too,\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Min Yoongi</b></i>.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p><i>I walk on this seesaw without you.

Probably won&rsquo;t be home tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Have a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s how most of your conversations go nowadays. Meeting each other in the morning before he left for practice, sometimes not meeting each other in the evening because one of you came home late. Texts messages and calls are basically non-existent.</p><p>Little does he know that you&rsquo;ve been going to your friends&rsquo; place to avoid him.</p><p>Little does he know that you&rsquo;ve been going to your friends&rsquo; place because it feels something more like <i>home</i>.</p><p>Little does he know that you&rsquo;ve been going to your friend&rsquo;s place to find comfort in them instead.</p><p>But, little do you know that he feels the same too.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing has really changed. There&rsquo;s no intense arguments, there&rsquo;s no finger-pointing, there&rsquo;s no liar, there&rsquo;s no self-blaming, except both of you have <i>pretended </i>so<i>.</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hyung</i>,&rdquo; Jimin was assigned a task with Yoongi at that time.</p><p>&ldquo;It has been a while since <i>noona</i> was here. Did you guys fight? You also didn&rsquo;t go to her place as much anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve not been feeling well lately, <i>hyung</i>. Couldn&rsquo;t you feel that?&rdquo; Yoongi let out a sigh. He can&rsquo;t deny it. Sooner or later the boys will find out that both of you have not been doing well.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how things work nowadays, Jimin. I just couldn&rsquo;t figure out where it had gone wrong. And I think, neither could she.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you talk to her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s nothing to talk about. It&rsquo;s not like I slapped her or the other way around. I just couldn&rsquo;t find something wrong in the relationship. It just doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, <i>hyung</i>,&rdquo; Yoongi couldn&rsquo;t continue his work. He walked out the room without saying anything, and closed the door behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Because, <b>neither of us want to leave</b>, Jimin.&rdquo;</p><p>Days have been passing just like that. It was September when you feel the change and now December is just around the corner. Yoongi and you probably had the same reasons on why neither of you could leave or want to leave. It&rsquo;s probably because neither of you wanted to become the <i>villains</i>. It&rsquo;s probably because none of you could find the reason to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>But someone <i>needs</i> to leave, or else the repeating heartbreak and the who-could-stay-the-longest competition will never end. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; you said, three days later.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome home,&rdquo; this is the first conversation you have after three days. You went straight to your room without saying anything. You hated the silence. You hated the atmosphere. You hated how you&rsquo;re not what you used to be. You hated that he accepted it.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, can we talk?&rdquo; Yoongi&rsquo;s voice stops you. You nodded your head, walking back to him who was sitting on the couch. There was a long silence between the both of you before Yoongi asked you a question.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to us?&rdquo; short, clear and precise.</p><p><i>I was wondering too, Yoongi.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Do we lost feeling for each other?&rdquo; he continued.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t know, Yoongi. I don&rsquo;t know.</i></p><p>&ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t have feeling for each other anymore. If we didn&rsquo;t think of each other anymore, why do we still hold into all of this?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Because I couldn&rsquo;t leave. If I leave, you&rsquo;ll have to repeat all of this alone. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Why are we still clinging over this, when we know there&rsquo;s nothing but insisting on believing there&rsquo;s something?&rdquo;</p><p><i>I know you&rsquo;re hurting too, Yoongi. I&rsquo;m sorry.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why does neither of us decided to leave?&rdquo; You could hear his voice shaking, one question after another. </p><p>Both of you know the answers to all those question. <i>It&rsquo;s just because none of you could leave and leave the other one neglected. Because the one leaving is the villain and the one left will play the victim.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/n,&rdquo; he called you again, you see his hand rubbing his eyes to stop the tears from falling, and he smiled instead.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi, no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving, so we can end this repeating seesaw game. I&rsquo;m leaving so you can point at me and say I play the villain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I&rsquo;m leaving. You got me?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t hold your tears anymore. Now, when you are really talking about <i>leaving</i>, it started to hurt.

You asked me to do this, so it\u2019s really your own fault,\u201d Jin teases, sitting down next to you on the bed. He takes no notice of your scowl, and leans down to kiss your forehead anyway. In your current mood, you take that as a huge insult and decide you have even more of a reason to complain,</p><p>\u201cGet off of you me, you dirty gym lover,\u201d You pout, turning over in bed and huffing.

He almost acts as a mirror and he can reflect anything you need him to and I think that the general state of his\u00a0being comes from his place in the Soul Body and how his energy center functions. It\u2019s a great balancing energy that stems from Jin\u2019s energy center and Kook\u2019s energy center that sits on either side of Taehyung\u2019s. It\u2019s more about the frequency output of the Soul Body, which he and Kook rule over, but it\u2019s a bit more clear to me now that Taehyung handles the mental perception while Kook handles the physical.</p><p>This is all well and good, but as we know, the energy center, the core, the soul, the spirit, the projected energy, the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind, and the conscious mind are all separate things and often act independently of the others and balance really relies on the conscious mind <i>consciously</i> aligning with everything else. For Taehyung there\u2019s a bit of \u201cbloop\u201d in the stability between how his core energy connects to his sub and unconscious mind through the Spirit. His core energy is fully \u201cenrobed\u201d in the energy center, but it\u2019s broken apart just as I was seeing it with the whole 700 faces thing.<br/></p><p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b><br/></p><!-- more --><p>The 700 faces thing is not a makeup of his core, it\u2019s actually a product of the somewhat negative connection between his subconscious and unconscious mind with his spirit. I\u2019ve made a post explaining the layers of energy and how they influence each other, so if you would like to read that real quick it\u2019s right <b><a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/177216069643/hi-could-you-perhaps-explain-the-distinction\">here</a>.</b></p><p>Basically, Taehyung has some issues with self-perception that stem from relatively simple things that really don\u2019t register that often in the conscious mind, but have been amplified by the core energy and its need to reflect what other people see in him. There\u2019s a conflict there between this unconscious need to fit everyone\u2019s perception while there is a more conscious effort to be an individual and be stable within himself and his own understanding of himself. The need to find creative outlets, as I mentioned in his previous reading, comes from this need to connect with his \u201creal self\u201d but he\u2019s not even aware that there is a difference between who he portrays and who he is internally within his core.</p><p>The reason for that is that his core consciousness, like his \u201csoul\u201d&hellip; I\u2019m mean it\u2019s not really his soul, it\u2019s part of his core, but it\u2019s not the whole core\u2026 very difficult to explain \u2014 anyway, his core consciousness is trying to reconnect and reestablish balance within Taehyung\u2019s core, but it can\u2019t really do that because it\u2019s all shriveled up and shoved in a closet, or at least that\u2019s how I was seeing it. This part of Taehyung is the \u201creal\u201d Taehyung in a sense, it\u2019s where his emotional center is and only when he is deeply upset does it actually come out, but even then his expression is relatively contained and the core doesn\u2019t get to see the light of day.</p><p>The reason this piece of his core is even hidden away in the first place has to do with a \u201cpolluted\u201d spirit that is being influenced by subconscious knowledge of his physical appearance. To me, something like this doesn\u2019t seem very serious, and I suppose it isn\u2019t because it\u2019s not a huge issue that he deals with or that cripples him the way his core state would make it seem, but it does impact him. It comes from some of the stuff that I removed from the original\u00a0reading so it would be a bit difficult to explain where exactly it stems from, but whatever right, people will get pissed about it no matter what because god forbid anyone ever assume that a human being is flawed in some way, lol.</p><p>So, this little piece of his core energy is hidden away, lost, paranoid, and very discouraged when it comes to being seen by people \u2014 this manifests in a more controlled expression which can sometimes come off as constantly acting or playing a character, exaggerated expressions, or seeming to drop emotions very quickly and replace them with others. Like I said in the last reading, this actually makes him a great actor in general, just being able to turn on and off his own feelings and portray his \u201cfaces\u201d so vividly that it can seem like he just has a natural born talent.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"422\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/386e2b60a3208e9924f2934cf7463f35/tumblr_inline_pf90p1TO4B1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"422\"/></figure><p>Just to kind of get an image of his energy, to really see where things are laid out for that small piece of the core rather than the overpowering piece, I pulled some cards to sort of lay things out.</p><p>The 5 of Swords and the Ace of Wands just shows how the more domineering side of the core is projecting over the fragmented part of the core.</p><p>The reversed Six of Cups shows why that little piece of the core, which rules over all of his Water energy, was broken off and hidden away. It falls down into the 9 of Wands and the 5 of Cups which holds true to the current state of this one piece of his core. This is where that piece is hidden, it\u2019s kind of underneath those energies. The fact that this happened was more so bloomed from people not liking his personality in the beginning (conscious level) and it quite literally, in a sense, traumatized him because of how his perception of himself works stemming from the 6 of Cups, and it caused him to repress that emotional, creative, expressive nature where he is 100% himself and not so controlled. If you are not able to see how much he actually controls and calculates his expression whether it be on an emotional front or with his artwork, then you really are not paying attention and have no concept of people past their projected personas\u2026 or you have an image in your head of him and your perception is being fueled by one of the many faces he has, which means you probably have a view of him that differs greatly from many other people, not just me.</p><p>So, he was actually pretty stable within himself because he just kind of grew out of the issues with his sense of self-worth, but it all came rushing back when he was put out there for the world to see. He was actually rather confident with himself and it feels like he took it as an opportunity to \u201cturn up the volume\u201d on his more creative and \u201cout there\u201d personality because he was expecting to stand out and have so many more people to relate to him and find him funny or interesting. But what happened is that people were laughing at him rather than with him, that is why he expressed that he doesn\u2019t like to be called \u201calien\u201d or \u201c4D\u201d or whatever else, it actually cuts him deep down, because he was trying to put his personality over his appearance, but when he did he was \u201cseen\u201d in a negative light which, as I mentioned, brought all of that insecurity and put more importance on his appearance as well as how his personality is seen by other people.\u00a0</p><p>That does not mean he is emotionally dead or that he operates like a robot, it means that he tends to \u201crun through his script\u201d before really projecting anything, and that is more subconscious. Literally, I was hearing a countdown happening before he speaks and that\u2019s kind of the vibe there, he\u2019s planning his actions so that he can fit the mold.</p><p>This here leads to The Chariot, The Moon, and Strength to be reversed energies within this piece of his core. The reversed Chariot is really that sudden stop in his expression, where a dam was built up around that water and it now has to be strained and filtered shot glass by shot glass before it can be filtered again through the spirit, then again through the different layers of the mind, and finally it is then expressed in a manner that he is most comfortable with on a conscious level. The Moon reversed is showing how this state of his core and his subconscious mind kind of toss the ball back and forth, both kind of depleting each other and validating those insecurities over and over again, while on a conscious level Taehyung is not really aware that this is happening, but he <i>feels</i> the imbalance and the disconnect within himself for which he tries to compensate with his creative exploration in art. Strength being reversed is just that depletion within that part of the core, why it is so frail and shriveled looking, hidden away and drying up from the lack of Water stimulation within the core.</p><p>The core is then projected through the Sun card and usually, the Sun card is seen as one of the most positive cards in the deck, but here it really wasn&rsquo;t it settling like that. The reason for that is because I couldn\u2019t see the child on the card, the one enjoying the freedom happiness, basking in the sunlight and the sunflowers, as Taehyung. Instead, I was seeing Taehyung as the Sun in the image, with the blank and neutral expression, while <i>we</i> as the audience are the child in the image.</p><p>We as the audience only find joy and satisfaction in this sunshine projection, this hologram of a person that we want to focus on because it\u2019s much easier to idolize someone if we are under the assumption that they are <i>idols</i> and not human beings with flaws and insecurities. If we see them as being human, we see them as being equal to us, in which case resentment can actually occur within some people as they start to project their own insecurities onto them by suddenly hating the fact that another human being is successful and talented. It\u2019s like seeing someone famous as being equal to you, only stands to point out how unequal you actually are on a social level. There\u2019s an awareness of that and a fear in that. From there you get the angry people who rush to the defense of their idols when such an awful insult such as having emotions or being human is suggested on their behalf because that Sun image is being stripped away and, of course, it helps them feel like they matter in some way to the idolized Sun by coming to their defense. Kind of like brainwashed cult followers with no perception of anything past what they are spoon fed&hellip; amazing.</p><p>The projected sunlight that the child on the card is basking in isn\u2019t even appreciated, it\u2019s just something that\u2019s there and as far as the child knows, it\u2019s always been there, it\u2019s always going to be there, because whenever the Sun is gone the child doesn\u2019t even notice because that is when they go to sleep. They pay no mind to the moments in which the Sun is not there because all they actually care about is the Sun and the Sun\u2019s light, nothing else.\u00a0</p><p>To assume Taehyung, or any of the members, have no flaws or insecurities that affect them deeply and to assume that what they show you is all there is to be seen, is no different than assuming that the Sun never sets.</p><p><b>The Reading</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"314\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ca9b017ae4f562c9d2c1c64f459a2c9/tumblr_inline_pf91ccnCxX1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"314\"/></figure><p><b>Current State of Core Energy:</b></p><ul><li><b>Peacock \u2014 Air</b><br/></li><li><b>Hyena \u2014 Fire</b><br/></li></ul><p>I mean\u2026</p><p>If you\u2019ve read Jimin\u2019s reading then you know how I feel about the Peacock card, and the Hyena card is really no different. The Peacock card always comes up when there is a conscious effort to mask something within yourself. This came up for Jimin in his core as well, and the Hyena would be one that I would also associate with him. Actually, Hoseok, Jimin, and Taehyung have that same sort of \u201cmask\u201d vibe, but they have different levels of it as well as different areas that they wish to hide.</p><p>The Peacock is the projected energy of the more domineering part of Taehyung\u2019s core, which would be the one I was mostly feeling in Part 1 of this reading. It\u2019s the part that projects all of the different faces and allows the other part of the core to hide out. It\u2019s a bit difficult even now to really tell if the more domineering part is actually forcing that energy down, or if it\u2019s supposed to be protecting it. Either way, this side of him is the one putting on the show.</p><p>The Hyena is always a weird card for me because it has a kinda-sorta positive description, not really though, but it\u2019s always carrying such a low-vibe when I get it in readings. I always get drawn to the moon in the image and no different than the Peacock does it show that something is being hidden. I think I got this card for Jimin when I did his reading, like while I was shuffling, but I didn\u2019t put it down specifically because I thought it was \u201ctoo on the nose\u201d with the whole light sun/dark sun thing.</p><p>The image on this card is how I see the more domineering side of Taehyung\u2019s core, standing over and in front of the shriveled part which is represented by the half moon in the background. It\u2019s got this sneer on its face and it looks evil as fuck, but like\u2026 it\u2019s kind of there for protection, kind of there to help out, and it\u2019s only appearing evil to those that want it to, like me with my fear of Capricorns, lol.</p><p>So, you can see the more \u201cproductive\u201d side of the dominant core where it\u2019s there to project the faces and keep up appearances with the Peacock, but then the more \u201csinister\u201d side where it\u2019s there to stand guard and hide the more Water fueled part of the core that is hidden away.</p><p>The mixture of Air and Fire is quite interesting as well considering that the most prominent color I saw in the core with the first reading was Red. It\u2019s like the \u201cwork\u201d of the dominant core fuels the fire energy that is used to sort of keep everything on lock. Again, it\u2019s out of protection, but that Fire is drying of the Water energy and that\u2019s why that fragment appears to be shriveled up and small, it\u2019s dehydrated.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"518\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6f2ca8aaaaa55192c0c1dbc28dd0fd0/tumblr_inline_pf91i1X38a1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"518\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Water Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Gazelle - Fire</b><br/></li></ul><p>And here we see that his Elemental Water is being filled with Fire. I was getting this more as a need to <i>do</i> rather than <i>feel</i>.</p><p>I talked about this in the last reading, how he will try to do what other people do in order to feel a connection. He doesn\u2019t explore much with his art, instead, he copies classical drawings and paintings and his photography style is paying homage to his favorite photographer. It\u2019s that structure thing where he wants it to look good, so he does what he knows other people already find appealing rather than trying something more outside of the box. I still think he needs to take up painting, like abstract work so that he can have that freedom to create something that can never really look good or bad, it can just simply be.</p><p>This alignment shows that there is a lot of stimulation within that part of the core. (The shriveled part of the core is directly connected to the Water alignment). Just as before, this part of the core is trying to connect, trying to branch out, and it\u2019s coming up in Taehyung\u2019s subconscious and conscious mind as a need to experience a connection with himself and with other people. Like, he\u2019s really, really trying and he\u2019s doing it like he\u2019s connecting just like he wants to, but he can\u2019t <i>feel</i> it because his receptive nature, the Water alignment, the part of his core that is shriveled is not in the game with him.</p><p>Again, this doesn\u2019t make him emotionally dead or incapable of experiencing love or showing love in any way, it\u2019s simply this feeling that something is missing and he can see that other people around him have what he is missing, but he still doesn\u2019t know what it is, because that intuitive nature that would allow him to figure that out and look within himself is not there. Like, he has no Water energy that can actively be used by him in the core. So, he\u2019s going to keep trying to find things to connect with, different mediums of art and expression, and he\u2019s going to try more and more to connect with people on a deeper level and he\u2019ll be able to do it, but he won\u2019t <i>feel</i> it.</p><p>This is also going to be amplified as with the ascension process the receptive nature of people will rise, and for people like Taehyung who carry no Water or have blocked or stunted Water energy in their core it can be quite a maddening experience as you would know there\u2019s something missing but never really be able to figure it out unless someone else pointed it out for you. There could be a sense, potentially, for these people that they are being left behind as the people around them progress on a soul level and expand consciously while they could be doing the exact same thing, but would not <i>feel </i>the ascension taking place.</p><p>Honestly, he just needs to have a deep chat with Yoongi and he\u2019ll be good, lol.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"480\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30db07a94def5502cb3930b4f5f8df6d/tumblr_inline_pf91qmWlA11rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"480\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Fire Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Panther \u2014 Fire</b><br/></li></ul><p>Again, it\u2019s very difficult to tell if the dominant part of the core is actually helping or not \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not a good thing because it\u2019s repressing part of the core, but it has \u201cgood intentions\u201d I guess? This here is where the dominant part of the core actually sits. It\u2019s in the Fire alignment which is another receptive energy, but obviously, this is where energy is projected outward more than brought in. This vibes with the Hyena and it\u2019s just so scary to me, but it\u2019s not hurting anything, I think. It\u2019s just like\u2026 overprotective?? I guess??</p><p>No, really though, this is a state of purging, which is a necessary thing in the ascension process (which is why the shriveled bit is trying so hard to get out now) but this is like\u2026 it\u2019s like the dominant part of the core is trying to purge out the shriveled bit entirely. Like, it\u2019s loading up the core with Fire and Earth energy and is trying to completely get rid of that tiny bit of Water energy that is still there.</p><p>OR!! Or it\u2019s more like it\u2019s trying to turn the Water alignment into another Fire alignment like it wants that part of the core to project itself too, but only in the way in which the Sun projects itself, with Fire and heat, the hologram that satisfies others. The Water element is personally gratifying, while the Fire element is for the gratification of other people. Like, it\u2019s trying to burn off any of the \u201cpersonality\u201d that is in there as it\u2019s already been decided within the spirit and the subconscious mind that the main person that is Taehyung is not well liked. Very fucking complicated.</p><p>It\u2019s a pretty gnarly internal situation that is manifesting on the conscious level as this need to simply connect and branch out and express himself more clearly to the people around him. He\u2019s seeking out deeper connections with people, trying to really show love and feel love for his friends and his family which, again, he already does but he thinks he\u2019s not <i>feeling </i>it enough.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"298\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10f6b67ff166c0b55fefb214ec9213ff/tumblr_inline_pf91vpodu21rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"298\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Earth Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Nightingale \u2014 Air</b><br/></li><li><b>Crocodile \u2014 Water (reversed)</b><br/></li></ul><p>The Earth alignment is where we can see stability, connection the physical space, as well as self-awareness. This right here is literally the \u201cinstability\u201d within his ability to feel coming from the two sides of the core. The Nightingale, the fearless singer who speaks and expresses itself freely, its up against the reversed crocodile where emotion and expression are cold and repressed. It\u2019s going back and forth, teetering back and forth between the two where he wants to let a lot out and be free, but then there\u2019s that subconscious bit that puts fear there and it&rsquo;s like, \u201cnah, you don&rsquo;t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>And that Water energy being reversed still shows a lack of Water energy in general. Like, I don\u2019t know where his Water energy is because the shriveled part of the core is completely dry, but it\u2019s still showing as being the receptive and \u201cWater bound\u201d part, so I\u2019m like?? Where\u2019s the Water?? Unless that shriveled part of the core has its own core where the Water is??</p><figure data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d0691211bb41005f720f49d92bb8573/tumblr_inline_pf91yidCgt1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"420\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Air Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Hummingbird \u2014 Air</b><br/></li></ul><p>Now, see, this is where his conscious mind is at. This is where his active thought process and communication is coming from. It\u2019s very positive and very not at all seeming to be connected fully or aware of any of the mess in the core. This card is very, very positive, and very happy. This card comes with the keywords, \u201cpositive, enthusiastic, spiritually resourceful, smart, curious, loves to learn\u201d and that\u2019s literally Taehyung. That\u2019s who he is and where most people would recognize that energy.</p><p>This is being directed towards that very clear interest in expressing and getting other people to express with him. I think I talked about it in his last reading or maybe a different reading about how he was matching Yoongi\u2019s energy, or he was trying to mirror Yoongi in a way specifically because he wanted to \u201cget on his level\u201d to try and connect. It\u2019s where that \u201cmirror\u201d thing comes in again, he knows how to use that to his advantage to actually help him make genuine connections with people. This is kind of where the Hummingbird is too in terms of communication, it like hovers at eye-level with anyone it wants to speak with.</p><p>This is also a card of creativity and exploration, which lends to his artistry and him trying his hand at many different forms of art, both taking inspiration from some people and then putting his own spin on it. I mean, just like in his last reading we can see the disconnect between the conscious mind and literally everything else. Of course, he is still influenced by everything just like everyone else in the world is, but his awareness of it is not quite there and I imagine he might have difficulty doing some self-processing. Like, sitting down and just being within the self could be difficult for him, but that can actually be done through projection as well like WITH ABSTRACT PAINTING where he can put something out on a canvas or paper with no real guidelines, no image in mind, and just <i>feel </i>something into the painting and, from there, physically see what his subconscious has put out there for him to see.</p><p>Painting and drawing things in an abstract manner is a great way for people who are not very receptive to channel through the subconscious mind.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"295\" data-orig-height=\"488\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6e329a986a3d0249a4d33b80afcb2e/tumblr_inline_pf924ue19r1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"295\" data-orig-height=\"488\"/></figure><p><b>Higher Self Core State:</b></p><ul><li><b>Tiger \u2014 Fire</b><br/></li></ul><p>This is dope as hell.</p><p>Okay, so the Higher Self, which would be within the energy center in the Soul Body is currently trying to shove this energy into the core to replace the Peacock and the Hyena. Do you know what this fucking card is???? It\u2019s lunar force, it\u2019s Water and Fire mixed, it\u2019s balanced reception and projection. Like, how fucking perfect is that??</p><p>Literally, this is just balanced all the way around, it\u2019s feminine energy, receptive energy, and WATER energy all coming in and just like clearing things out and letting everything settle so that the shriveled bit won\u2019t be so shriveled anymore, but the projected Fire will still be there to, you know, <i>project</i>.</p><p>This energy is very balanced and very confident and sure of itself, which is really what he needs on a core level. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really going to have time, or even a way at all really, to work through the root cause of this imbalance, but I think with the ascension process this is going to be a forced balance, like it\u2019s just going to occur, a bit of Divine Intervention there. I think I talked about that in the OT7 2018/2019 Outlook reading, about how forced balance could occur, but that was for all of them and that was when the Soul Body was still being fucked with so, who knows.</p><p>Overall, most of Taehyung\u2019s imbalances stem from spirit pollution that came from the subconscious mind and fragmented the core so that the receptive and emotional side, that could have already been brittle, broke off and was locked away. This response from the core to do this comes from the influence of the energy center and its position in the Soul Body as its main focus is the mental perception of the spectator. For Taehyung, his connection and alignment with all of the layers of his own personal Soul Body is very not at all strong or clear, but they still affect him on each level and manifest in ways that can have him contradicting himself or simply being confused by himself, confused about what he wants and what he feels he is missing.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a huge deal though, most of the imbalance is purely in the core and it has nothing to do with low-vibe influence, it is simply how he is on that level. Consciously, he struggles with it, but not in a way where he is experiencing breakdowns or showing any real instability. It\u2019s just some \u201cI need to find myself\u201d kind of vibes there on that level that most people in their 20\u2032s experience.</p><p>He\u2019ll level out at some point, but I think the process would speed up a bit if he would do some ABSTRACT PAINTING PLEASE I\u2019VE BEEN SEEING THAT FOR HIM FOR MONTHS NOW OMG.</p><p>Okay, bye.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBlueMoonPunch&amp;t=MmYxMGM2MGVmZmU0MTUyYzk4YTIyNDIwOTU3N2IwMDEyNDEzZDk5NCxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">SHOP</a> | <a href=\"http://mopoglo.tumblr.com/\">MAIN BLOG</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbluemoonpunch%2F&amp;t=MjM2NjhmNzYzY2VmMjI0YWE3NzhjMWQyMzE4ZDRjOTFkNDM4ODJjMyxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">INSTA</a> | <a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/176169780918/idolcelebrity-readings-list\">MORE BTS READINGS</a></b><br/></p>",

He almost acts as a mirror and he can reflect anything you need him to and I think that the general state of his&nbsp;being comes from his place in the Soul Body and how his energy center functions. It&rsquo;s a great balancing energy that stems from Jin&rsquo;s energy center and Kook&rsquo;s energy center that sits on either side of Taehyung&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s more about the frequency output of the Soul Body, which he and Kook rule over, but it&rsquo;s a bit more clear to me now that Taehyung handles the mental perception while Kook handles the physical.</p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but as we know, the energy center, the core, the soul, the spirit, the projected energy, the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind, and the conscious mind are all separate things and often act independently of the others and balance really relies on the conscious mind <i>consciously</i> aligning with everything else. For Taehyung there&rsquo;s a bit of &ldquo;bloop&rdquo; in the stability between how his core energy connects to his sub and unconscious mind through the Spirit. His core energy is fully &ldquo;enrobed&rdquo; in the energy center, but it&rsquo;s broken apart just as I was seeing it with the whole 700 faces thing.<br></p>\n<p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b><br></p>\n",

He almost acts as a mirror and he can reflect anything you need him to and I think that the general state of his\u00a0being comes from his place in the Soul Body and how his energy center functions. It\u2019s a great balancing energy that stems from Jin\u2019s energy center and Kook\u2019s energy center that sits on either side of Taehyung\u2019s. It\u2019s more about the frequency output of the Soul Body, which he and Kook rule over, but it\u2019s a bit more clear to me now that Taehyung handles the mental perception while Kook handles the physical.</p><p>This is all well and good, but as we know, the energy center, the core, the soul, the spirit, the projected energy, the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind, and the conscious mind are all separate things and often act independently of the others and balance really relies on the conscious mind <i>consciously</i> aligning with everything else. For Taehyung there\u2019s a bit of \u201cbloop\u201d in the stability between how his core energy connects to his sub and unconscious mind through the Spirit. His core energy is fully \u201cenrobed\u201d in the energy center, but it\u2019s broken apart just as I was seeing it with the whole 700 faces thing.<br></p><p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>The 700 faces thing is not a makeup of his core, it\u2019s actually a product of the somewhat negative connection between his subconscious and unconscious mind with his spirit. I\u2019ve made a post explaining the layers of energy and how they influence each other, so if you would like to read that real quick it\u2019s right <b><a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/177216069643/hi-could-you-perhaps-explain-the-distinction\">here</a>.</b></p><p>Basically, Taehyung has some issues with self-perception that stem from relatively simple things that really don\u2019t register that often in the conscious mind, but have been amplified by the core energy and its need to reflect what other people see in him. There\u2019s a conflict there between this unconscious need to fit everyone\u2019s perception while there is a more conscious effort to be an individual and be stable within himself and his own understanding of himself. The need to find creative outlets, as I mentioned in his previous reading, comes from this need to connect with his \u201creal self\u201d but he\u2019s not even aware that there is a difference between who he portrays and who he is internally within his core.</p><p>The reason for that is that his core consciousness, like his \u201csoul\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m mean it\u2019s not really his soul, it\u2019s part of his core, but it\u2019s not the whole core\u2026 very difficult to explain \u2014 anyway, his core consciousness is trying to reconnect and reestablish balance within Taehyung\u2019s core, but it can\u2019t really do that because it\u2019s all shriveled up and shoved in a closet, or at least that\u2019s how I was seeing it. This part of Taehyung is the \u201creal\u201d Taehyung in a sense, it\u2019s where his emotional center is and only when he is deeply upset does it actually come out, but even then his expression is relatively contained and the core doesn\u2019t get to see the light of day.</p><p>The reason this piece of his core is even hidden away in the first place has to do with a \u201cpolluted\u201d spirit that is being influenced by subconscious knowledge of his physical appearance. To me, something like this doesn\u2019t seem very serious, and I suppose it isn\u2019t because it\u2019s not a huge issue that he deals with or that cripples him the way his core state would make it seem, but it does impact him. It comes from some of the stuff that I removed from the original\u00a0reading so it would be a bit difficult to explain where exactly it stems from, but whatever right, people will get pissed about it no matter what because god forbid anyone ever assume that a human being is flawed in some way, lol.</p><p>So, this little piece of his core energy is hidden away, lost, paranoid, and very discouraged when it comes to being seen by people \u2014 this manifests in a more controlled expression which can sometimes come off as constantly acting or playing a character, exaggerated expressions, or seeming to drop emotions very quickly and replace them with others. Like I said in the last reading, this actually makes him a great actor in general, just being able to turn on and off his own feelings and portray his \u201cfaces\u201d so vividly that it can seem like he just has a natural born talent.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"422\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/386e2b60a3208e9924f2934cf7463f35/tumblr_inline_pf90p1TO4B1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"422\"></figure><p>Just to kind of get an image of his energy, to really see where things are laid out for that small piece of the core rather than the overpowering piece, I pulled some cards to sort of lay things out.</p><p>The 5 of Swords and the Ace of Wands just shows how the more domineering side of the core is projecting over the fragmented part of the core.</p><p>The reversed Six of Cups shows why that little piece of the core, which rules over all of his Water energy, was broken off and hidden away. It falls down into the 9 of Wands and the 5 of Cups which holds true to the current state of this one piece of his core. This is where that piece is hidden, it\u2019s kind of underneath those energies. The fact that this happened was more so bloomed from people not liking his personality in the beginning (conscious level) and it quite literally, in a sense, traumatized him because of how his perception of himself works stemming from the 6 of Cups, and it caused him to repress that emotional, creative, expressive nature where he is 100% himself and not so controlled. If you are not able to see how much he actually controls and calculates his expression whether it be on an emotional front or with his artwork, then you really are not paying attention and have no concept of people past their projected personas\u2026 or you have an image in your head of him and your perception is being fueled by one of the many faces he has, which means you probably have a view of him that differs greatly from many other people, not just me.</p><p>So, he was actually pretty stable within himself because he just kind of grew out of the issues with his sense of self-worth, but it all came rushing back when he was put out there for the world to see. He was actually rather confident with himself and it feels like he took it as an opportunity to \u201cturn up the volume\u201d on his more creative and \u201cout there\u201d personality because he was expecting to stand out and have so many more people to relate to him and find him funny or interesting. But what happened is that people were laughing at him rather than with him, that is why he expressed that he doesn\u2019t like to be called \u201calien\u201d or \u201c4D\u201d or whatever else, it actually cuts him deep down, because he was trying to put his personality over his appearance, but when he did he was \u201cseen\u201d in a negative light which, as I mentioned, brought all of that insecurity and put more importance on his appearance as well as how his personality is seen by other people.\u00a0</p><p>That does not mean he is emotionally dead or that he operates like a robot, it means that he tends to \u201crun through his script\u201d before really projecting anything, and that is more subconscious. Literally, I was hearing a countdown happening before he speaks and that\u2019s kind of the vibe there, he\u2019s planning his actions so that he can fit the mold.</p><p>This here leads to The Chariot, The Moon, and Strength to be reversed energies within this piece of his core. The reversed Chariot is really that sudden stop in his expression, where a dam was built up around that water and it now has to be strained and filtered shot glass by shot glass before it can be filtered again through the spirit, then again through the different layers of the mind, and finally it is then expressed in a manner that he is most comfortable with on a conscious level. The Moon reversed is showing how this state of his core and his subconscious mind kind of toss the ball back and forth, both kind of depleting each other and validating those insecurities over and over again, while on a conscious level Taehyung is not really aware that this is happening, but he <i>feels</i> the imbalance and the disconnect within himself for which he tries to compensate with his creative exploration in art. Strength being reversed is just that depletion within that part of the core, why it is so frail and shriveled looking, hidden away and drying up from the lack of Water stimulation within the core.</p><p>The core is then projected through the Sun card and usually, the Sun card is seen as one of the most positive cards in the deck, but here it really wasn\u2019t it settling like that. The reason for that is because I couldn\u2019t see the child on the card, the one enjoying the freedom happiness, basking in the sunlight and the sunflowers, as Taehyung. Instead, I was seeing Taehyung as the Sun in the image, with the blank and neutral expression, while <i>we</i> as the audience are the child in the image.</p><p>We as the audience only find joy and satisfaction in this sunshine projection, this hologram of a person that we want to focus on because it\u2019s much easier to idolize someone if we are under the assumption that they are <i>idols</i> and not human beings with flaws and insecurities. If we see them as being human, we see them as being equal to us, in which case resentment can actually occur within some people as they start to project their own insecurities onto them by suddenly hating the fact that another human being is successful and talented. It\u2019s like seeing someone famous as being equal to you, only stands to point out how unequal you actually are on a social level. There\u2019s an awareness of that and a fear in that. From there you get the angry people who rush to the defense of their idols when such an awful insult such as having emotions or being human is suggested on their behalf because that Sun image is being stripped away and, of course, it helps them feel like they matter in some way to the idolized Sun by coming to their defense. Kind of like brainwashed cult followers with no perception of anything past what they are spoon fed\u2026 amazing.</p><p>The projected sunlight that the child on the card is basking in isn\u2019t even appreciated, it\u2019s just something that\u2019s there and as far as the child knows, it\u2019s always been there, it\u2019s always going to be there, because whenever the Sun is gone the child doesn\u2019t even notice because that is when they go to sleep. They pay no mind to the moments in which the Sun is not there because all they actually care about is the Sun and the Sun\u2019s light, nothing else.\u00a0</p><p>To assume Taehyung, or any of the members, have no flaws or insecurities that affect them deeply and to assume that what they show you is all there is to be seen, is no different than assuming that the Sun never sets.</p><p><b>The Reading</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"314\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ca9b017ae4f562c9d2c1c64f459a2c9/tumblr_inline_pf91ccnCxX1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"314\"></figure><p><b>Current State of Core Energy:</b></p><ul><li><b>Peacock \u2014 Air</b><br></li><li><b>Hyena \u2014 Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>I mean\u2026</p><p>If you\u2019ve read Jimin\u2019s reading then you know how I feel about the Peacock card, and the Hyena card is really no different. The Peacock card always comes up when there is a conscious effort to mask something within yourself. This came up for Jimin in his core as well, and the Hyena would be one that I would also associate with him. Actually, Hoseok, Jimin, and Taehyung have that same sort of \u201cmask\u201d vibe, but they have different levels of it as well as different areas that they wish to hide.</p><p>The Peacock is the projected energy of the more domineering part of Taehyung\u2019s core, which would be the one I was mostly feeling in Part 1 of this reading. It\u2019s the part that projects all of the different faces and allows the other part of the core to hide out. It\u2019s a bit difficult even now to really tell if the more domineering part is actually forcing that energy down, or if it\u2019s supposed to be protecting it. Either way, this side of him is the one putting on the show.</p><p>The Hyena is always a weird card for me because it has a kinda-sorta positive description, not really though, but it\u2019s always carrying such a low-vibe when I get it in readings. I always get drawn to the moon in the image and no different than the Peacock does it show that something is being hidden. I think I got this card for Jimin when I did his reading, like while I was shuffling, but I didn\u2019t put it down specifically because I thought it was \u201ctoo on the nose\u201d with the whole light sun/dark sun thing.</p><p>The image on this card is how I see the more domineering side of Taehyung\u2019s core, standing over and in front of the shriveled part which is represented by the half moon in the background. It\u2019s got this sneer on its face and it looks evil as fuck, but like\u2026 it\u2019s kind of there for protection, kind of there to help out, and it\u2019s only appearing evil to those that want it to, like me with my fear of Capricorns, lol.</p><p>So, you can see the more \u201cproductive\u201d side of the dominant core where it\u2019s there to project the faces and keep up appearances with the Peacock, but then the more \u201csinister\u201d side where it\u2019s there to stand guard and hide the more Water fueled part of the core that is hidden away.</p><p>The mixture of Air and Fire is quite interesting as well considering that the most prominent color I saw in the core with the first reading was Red. It\u2019s like the \u201cwork\u201d of the dominant core fuels the fire energy that is used to sort of keep everything on lock. Again, it\u2019s out of protection, but that Fire is drying of the Water energy and that\u2019s why that fragment appears to be shriveled up and small, it\u2019s dehydrated.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"518\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6f2ca8aaaaa55192c0c1dbc28dd0fd0/tumblr_inline_pf91i1X38a1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"518\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Water Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Gazelle - Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>And here we see that his Elemental Water is being filled with Fire. I was getting this more as a need to <i>do</i> rather than <i>feel</i>.</p><p>I talked about this in the last reading, how he will try to do what other people do in order to feel a connection. He doesn\u2019t explore much with his art, instead, he copies classical drawings and paintings and his photography style is paying homage to his favorite photographer. It\u2019s that structure thing where he wants it to look good, so he does what he knows other people already find appealing rather than trying something more outside of the box. I still think he needs to take up painting, like abstract work so that he can have that freedom to create something that can never really look good or bad, it can just simply be.</p><p>This alignment shows that there is a lot of stimulation within that part of the core. (The shriveled part of the core is directly connected to the Water alignment). Just as before, this part of the core is trying to connect, trying to branch out, and it\u2019s coming up in Taehyung\u2019s subconscious and conscious mind as a need to experience a connection with himself and with other people. Like, he\u2019s really, really trying and he\u2019s doing it like he\u2019s connecting just like he wants to, but he can\u2019t <i>feel</i> it because his receptive nature, the Water alignment, the part of his core that is shriveled is not in the game with him.</p><p>Again, this doesn\u2019t make him emotionally dead or incapable of experiencing love or showing love in any way, it\u2019s simply this feeling that something is missing and he can see that other people around him have what he is missing, but he still doesn\u2019t know what it is, because that intuitive nature that would allow him to figure that out and look within himself is not there. Like, he has no Water energy that can actively be used by him in the core. So, he\u2019s going to keep trying to find things to connect with, different mediums of art and expression, and he\u2019s going to try more and more to connect with people on a deeper level and he\u2019ll be able to do it, but he won\u2019t <i>feel</i> it.</p><p>This is also going to be amplified as with the ascension process the receptive nature of people will rise, and for people like Taehyung who carry no Water or have blocked or stunted Water energy in their core it can be quite a maddening experience as you would know there\u2019s something missing but never really be able to figure it out unless someone else pointed it out for you. There could be a sense, potentially, for these people that they are being left behind as the people around them progress on a soul level and expand consciously while they could be doing the exact same thing, but would not <i>feel </i>the ascension taking place.</p><p>Honestly, he just needs to have a deep chat with Yoongi and he\u2019ll be good, lol.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"480\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30db07a94def5502cb3930b4f5f8df6d/tumblr_inline_pf91qmWlA11rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"480\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Fire Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Panther \u2014 Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>Again, it\u2019s very difficult to tell if the dominant part of the core is actually helping or not \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not a good thing because it\u2019s repressing part of the core, but it has \u201cgood intentions\u201d I guess? This here is where the dominant part of the core actually sits. It\u2019s in the Fire alignment which is another receptive energy, but obviously, this is where energy is projected outward more than brought in. This vibes with the Hyena and it\u2019s just so scary to me, but it\u2019s not hurting anything, I think. It\u2019s just like\u2026 overprotective?? I guess??</p><p>No, really though, this is a state of purging, which is a necessary thing in the ascension process (which is why the shriveled bit is trying so hard to get out now) but this is like\u2026 it\u2019s like the dominant part of the core is trying to purge out the shriveled bit entirely. Like, it\u2019s loading up the core with Fire and Earth energy and is trying to completely get rid of that tiny bit of Water energy that is still there.</p><p>OR!! Or it\u2019s more like it\u2019s trying to turn the Water alignment into another Fire alignment like it wants that part of the core to project itself too, but only in the way in which the Sun projects itself, with Fire and heat, the hologram that satisfies others. The Water element is personally gratifying, while the Fire element is for the gratification of other people. Like, it\u2019s trying to burn off any of the \u201cpersonality\u201d that is in there as it\u2019s already been decided within the spirit and the subconscious mind that the main person that is Taehyung is not well liked. Very fucking complicated.</p><p>It\u2019s a pretty gnarly internal situation that is manifesting on the conscious level as this need to simply connect and branch out and express himself more clearly to the people around him. He\u2019s seeking out deeper connections with people, trying to really show love and feel love for his friends and his family which, again, he already does but he thinks he\u2019s not <i>feeling </i>it enough.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"298\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10f6b67ff166c0b55fefb214ec9213ff/tumblr_inline_pf91vpodu21rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"298\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Earth Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Nightingale \u2014 Air</b><br></li><li><b>Crocodile \u2014 Water (reversed)</b><br></li></ul><p>The Earth alignment is where we can see stability, connection the physical space, as well as self-awareness. This right here is literally the \u201cinstability\u201d within his ability to feel coming from the two sides of the core. The Nightingale, the fearless singer who speaks and expresses itself freely, its up against the reversed crocodile where emotion and expression are cold and repressed. It\u2019s going back and forth, teetering back and forth between the two where he wants to let a lot out and be free, but then there\u2019s that subconscious bit that puts fear there and it\u2019s like, \u201cnah, you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>And that Water energy being reversed still shows a lack of Water energy in general. Like, I don\u2019t know where his Water energy is because the shriveled part of the core is completely dry, but it\u2019s still showing as being the receptive and \u201cWater bound\u201d part, so I\u2019m like?? Where\u2019s the Water?? Unless that shriveled part of the core has its own core where the Water is??</p><figure data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d0691211bb41005f720f49d92bb8573/tumblr_inline_pf91yidCgt1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"420\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Air Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Hummingbird \u2014 Air</b><br></li></ul><p>Now, see, this is where his conscious mind is at. This is where his active thought process and communication is coming from. It\u2019s very positive and very not at all seeming to be connected fully or aware of any of the mess in the core. This card is very, very positive, and very happy. This card comes with the keywords, \u201cpositive, enthusiastic, spiritually resourceful, smart, curious, loves to learn\u201d and that\u2019s literally Taehyung. That\u2019s who he is and where most people would recognize that energy.</p><p>This is being directed towards that very clear interest in expressing and getting other people to express with him. I think I talked about it in his last reading or maybe a different reading about how he was matching Yoongi\u2019s energy, or he was trying to mirror Yoongi in a way specifically because he wanted to \u201cget on his level\u201d to try and connect. It\u2019s where that \u201cmirror\u201d thing comes in again, he knows how to use that to his advantage to actually help him make genuine connections with people. This is kind of where the Hummingbird is too in terms of communication, it like hovers at eye-level with anyone it wants to speak with.</p><p>This is also a card of creativity and exploration, which lends to his artistry and him trying his hand at many different forms of art, both taking inspiration from some people and then putting his own spin on it. I mean, just like in his last reading we can see the disconnect between the conscious mind and literally everything else. Of course, he is still influenced by everything just like everyone else in the world is, but his awareness of it is not quite there and I imagine he might have difficulty doing some self-processing. Like, sitting down and just being within the self could be difficult for him, but that can actually be done through projection as well like WITH ABSTRACT PAINTING where he can put something out on a canvas or paper with no real guidelines, no image in mind, and just <i>feel </i>something into the painting and, from there, physically see what his subconscious has put out there for him to see.</p><p>Painting and drawing things in an abstract manner is a great way for people who are not very receptive to channel through the subconscious mind.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"295\" data-orig-height=\"488\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6e329a986a3d0249a4d33b80afcb2e/tumblr_inline_pf924ue19r1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"295\" data-orig-height=\"488\"></figure><p><b>Higher Self Core State:</b></p><ul><li><b>Tiger \u2014 Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>This is dope as hell.</p><p>Okay, so the Higher Self, which would be within the energy center in the Soul Body is currently trying to shove this energy into the core to replace the Peacock and the Hyena. Do you know what this fucking card is???? It\u2019s lunar force, it\u2019s Water and Fire mixed, it\u2019s balanced reception and projection. Like, how fucking perfect is that??</p><p>Literally, this is just balanced all the way around, it\u2019s feminine energy, receptive energy, and WATER energy all coming in and just like clearing things out and letting everything settle so that the shriveled bit won\u2019t be so shriveled anymore, but the projected Fire will still be there to, you know, <i>project</i>.</p><p>This energy is very balanced and very confident and sure of itself, which is really what he needs on a core level. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really going to have time, or even a way at all really, to work through the root cause of this imbalance, but I think with the ascension process this is going to be a forced balance, like it\u2019s just going to occur, a bit of Divine Intervention there. I think I talked about that in the OT7 2018/2019 Outlook reading, about how forced balance could occur, but that was for all of them and that was when the Soul Body was still being fucked with so, who knows.</p><p>Overall, most of Taehyung\u2019s imbalances stem from spirit pollution that came from the subconscious mind and fragmented the core so that the receptive and emotional side, that could have already been brittle, broke off and was locked away. This response from the core to do this comes from the influence of the energy center and its position in the Soul Body as its main focus is the mental perception of the spectator. For Taehyung, his connection and alignment with all of the layers of his own personal Soul Body is very not at all strong or clear, but they still affect him on each level and manifest in ways that can have him contradicting himself or simply being confused by himself, confused about what he wants and what he feels he is missing.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a huge deal though, most of the imbalance is purely in the core and it has nothing to do with low-vibe influence, it is simply how he is on that level. Consciously, he struggles with it, but not in a way where he is experiencing breakdowns or showing any real instability. It\u2019s just some \u201cI need to find myself\u201d kind of vibes there on that level that most people in their 20\u2032s experience.</p><p>He\u2019ll level out at some point, but I think the process would speed up a bit if he would do some ABSTRACT PAINTING PLEASE I\u2019VE BEEN SEEING THAT FOR HIM FOR MONTHS NOW OMG.</p><p>Okay, bye.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBlueMoonPunch&amp;t=MmYxMGM2MGVmZmU0MTUyYzk4YTIyNDIwOTU3N2IwMDEyNDEzZDk5NCxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">SHOP</a> | <a href=\"http://mopoglo.tumblr.com/\">MAIN BLOG</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbluemoonpunch%2F&amp;t=MjM2NjhmNzYzY2VmMjI0YWE3NzhjMWQyMzE4ZDRjOTFkNDM4ODJjMyxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">INSTA</a> | <a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/176169780918/idolcelebrity-readings-list\">MORE BTS READINGS</a></b><br></p></p>",

He almost acts as a mirror and he can reflect anything you need him to and I think that the general state of his\u00a0being comes from his place in the Soul Body and how his energy center functions. It\u2019s a great balancing energy that stems from Jin\u2019s energy center and Kook\u2019s energy center that sits on either side of Taehyung\u2019s. It\u2019s more about the frequency output of the Soul Body, which he and Kook rule over, but it\u2019s a bit more clear to me now that Taehyung handles the mental perception while Kook handles the physical.</p><p>This is all well and good, but as we know, the energy center, the core, the soul, the spirit, the projected energy, the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind, and the conscious mind are all separate things and often act independently of the others and balance really relies on the conscious mind <i>consciously</i> aligning with everything else. For Taehyung there\u2019s a bit of \u201cbloop\u201d in the stability between how his core energy connects to his sub and unconscious mind through the Spirit. His core energy is fully \u201cenrobed\u201d in the energy center, but it\u2019s broken apart just as I was seeing it with the whole 700 faces thing.<br></p><p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>The 700 faces thing is not a makeup of his core, it\u2019s actually a product of the somewhat negative connection between his subconscious and unconscious mind with his spirit. I\u2019ve made a post explaining the layers of energy and how they influence each other, so if you would like to read that real quick it\u2019s right <b><a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/177216069643/hi-could-you-perhaps-explain-the-distinction\">here</a>.</b></p><p>Basically, Taehyung has some issues with self-perception that stem from relatively simple things that really don\u2019t register that often in the conscious mind, but have been amplified by the core energy and its need to reflect what other people see in him. There\u2019s a conflict there between this unconscious need to fit everyone\u2019s perception while there is a more conscious effort to be an individual and be stable within himself and his own understanding of himself. The need to find creative outlets, as I mentioned in his previous reading, comes from this need to connect with his \u201creal self\u201d but he\u2019s not even aware that there is a difference between who he portrays and who he is internally within his core.</p><p>The reason for that is that his core consciousness, like his \u201csoul\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m mean it\u2019s not really his soul, it\u2019s part of his core, but it\u2019s not the whole core\u2026 very difficult to explain \u2014 anyway, his core consciousness is trying to reconnect and reestablish balance within Taehyung\u2019s core, but it can\u2019t really do that because it\u2019s all shriveled up and shoved in a closet, or at least that\u2019s how I was seeing it. This part of Taehyung is the \u201creal\u201d Taehyung in a sense, it\u2019s where his emotional center is and only when he is deeply upset does it actually come out, but even then his expression is relatively contained and the core doesn\u2019t get to see the light of day.</p><p>The reason this piece of his core is even hidden away in the first place has to do with a \u201cpolluted\u201d spirit that is being influenced by subconscious knowledge of his physical appearance. To me, something like this doesn\u2019t seem very serious, and I suppose it isn\u2019t because it\u2019s not a huge issue that he deals with or that cripples him the way his core state would make it seem, but it does impact him. It comes from some of the stuff that I removed from the original\u00a0reading so it would be a bit difficult to explain where exactly it stems from, but whatever right, people will get pissed about it no matter what because god forbid anyone ever assume that a human being is flawed in some way, lol.</p><p>So, this little piece of his core energy is hidden away, lost, paranoid, and very discouraged when it comes to being seen by people \u2014 this manifests in a more controlled expression which can sometimes come off as constantly acting or playing a character, exaggerated expressions, or seeming to drop emotions very quickly and replace them with others. Like I said in the last reading, this actually makes him a great actor in general, just being able to turn on and off his own feelings and portray his \u201cfaces\u201d so vividly that it can seem like he just has a natural born talent.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"422\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/386e2b60a3208e9924f2934cf7463f35/tumblr_inline_pf90p1TO4B1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"422\"></figure><p>Just to kind of get an image of his energy, to really see where things are laid out for that small piece of the core rather than the overpowering piece, I pulled some cards to sort of lay things out.</p><p>The 5 of Swords and the Ace of Wands just shows how the more domineering side of the core is projecting over the fragmented part of the core.</p><p>The reversed Six of Cups shows why that little piece of the core, which rules over all of his Water energy, was broken off and hidden away. It falls down into the 9 of Wands and the 5 of Cups which holds true to the current state of this one piece of his core. This is where that piece is hidden, it\u2019s kind of underneath those energies. The fact that this happened was more so bloomed from people not liking his personality in the beginning (conscious level) and it quite literally, in a sense, traumatized him because of how his perception of himself works stemming from the 6 of Cups, and it caused him to repress that emotional, creative, expressive nature where he is 100% himself and not so controlled. If you are not able to see how much he actually controls and calculates his expression whether it be on an emotional front or with his artwork, then you really are not paying attention and have no concept of people past their projected personas\u2026 or you have an image in your head of him and your perception is being fueled by one of the many faces he has, which means you probably have a view of him that differs greatly from many other people, not just me.</p><p>So, he was actually pretty stable within himself because he just kind of grew out of the issues with his sense of self-worth, but it all came rushing back when he was put out there for the world to see. He was actually rather confident with himself and it feels like he took it as an opportunity to \u201cturn up the volume\u201d on his more creative and \u201cout there\u201d personality because he was expecting to stand out and have so many more people to relate to him and find him funny or interesting. But what happened is that people were laughing at him rather than with him, that is why he expressed that he doesn\u2019t like to be called \u201calien\u201d or \u201c4D\u201d or whatever else, it actually cuts him deep down, because he was trying to put his personality over his appearance, but when he did he was \u201cseen\u201d in a negative light which, as I mentioned, brought all of that insecurity and put more importance on his appearance as well as how his personality is seen by other people.\u00a0</p><p>That does not mean he is emotionally dead or that he operates like a robot, it means that he tends to \u201crun through his script\u201d before really projecting anything, and that is more subconscious. Literally, I was hearing a countdown happening before he speaks and that\u2019s kind of the vibe there, he\u2019s planning his actions so that he can fit the mold.</p><p>This here leads to The Chariot, The Moon, and Strength to be reversed energies within this piece of his core. The reversed Chariot is really that sudden stop in his expression, where a dam was built up around that water and it now has to be strained and filtered shot glass by shot glass before it can be filtered again through the spirit, then again through the different layers of the mind, and finally it is then expressed in a manner that he is most comfortable with on a conscious level. The Moon reversed is showing how this state of his core and his subconscious mind kind of toss the ball back and forth, both kind of depleting each other and validating those insecurities over and over again, while on a conscious level Taehyung is not really aware that this is happening, but he <i>feels</i> the imbalance and the disconnect within himself for which he tries to compensate with his creative exploration in art. Strength being reversed is just that depletion within that part of the core, why it is so frail and shriveled looking, hidden away and drying up from the lack of Water stimulation within the core.</p><p>The core is then projected through the Sun card and usually, the Sun card is seen as one of the most positive cards in the deck, but here it really wasn\u2019t it settling like that. The reason for that is because I couldn\u2019t see the child on the card, the one enjoying the freedom happiness, basking in the sunlight and the sunflowers, as Taehyung. Instead, I was seeing Taehyung as the Sun in the image, with the blank and neutral expression, while <i>we</i> as the audience are the child in the image.</p><p>We as the audience only find joy and satisfaction in this sunshine projection, this hologram of a person that we want to focus on because it\u2019s much easier to idolize someone if we are under the assumption that they are <i>idols</i> and not human beings with flaws and insecurities. If we see them as being human, we see them as being equal to us, in which case resentment can actually occur within some people as they start to project their own insecurities onto them by suddenly hating the fact that another human being is successful and talented. It\u2019s like seeing someone famous as being equal to you, only stands to point out how unequal you actually are on a social level. There\u2019s an awareness of that and a fear in that. From there you get the angry people who rush to the defense of their idols when such an awful insult such as having emotions or being human is suggested on their behalf because that Sun image is being stripped away and, of course, it helps them feel like they matter in some way to the idolized Sun by coming to their defense. Kind of like brainwashed cult followers with no perception of anything past what they are spoon fed\u2026 amazing.</p><p>The projected sunlight that the child on the card is basking in isn\u2019t even appreciated, it\u2019s just something that\u2019s there and as far as the child knows, it\u2019s always been there, it\u2019s always going to be there, because whenever the Sun is gone the child doesn\u2019t even notice because that is when they go to sleep. They pay no mind to the moments in which the Sun is not there because all they actually care about is the Sun and the Sun\u2019s light, nothing else.\u00a0</p><p>To assume Taehyung, or any of the members, have no flaws or insecurities that affect them deeply and to assume that what they show you is all there is to be seen, is no different than assuming that the Sun never sets.</p><p><b>The Reading</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"314\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ca9b017ae4f562c9d2c1c64f459a2c9/tumblr_inline_pf91ccnCxX1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"314\"></figure><p><b>Current State of Core Energy:</b></p><ul><li><b>Peacock \u2014 Air</b><br></li><li><b>Hyena \u2014 Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>I mean\u2026</p><p>If you\u2019ve read Jimin\u2019s reading then you know how I feel about the Peacock card, and the Hyena card is really no different. The Peacock card always comes up when there is a conscious effort to mask something within yourself. This came up for Jimin in his core as well, and the Hyena would be one that I would also associate with him. Actually, Hoseok, Jimin, and Taehyung have that same sort of \u201cmask\u201d vibe, but they have different levels of it as well as different areas that they wish to hide.</p><p>The Peacock is the projected energy of the more domineering part of Taehyung\u2019s core, which would be the one I was mostly feeling in Part 1 of this reading. It\u2019s the part that projects all of the different faces and allows the other part of the core to hide out. It\u2019s a bit difficult even now to really tell if the more domineering part is actually forcing that energy down, or if it\u2019s supposed to be protecting it. Either way, this side of him is the one putting on the show.</p><p>The Hyena is always a weird card for me because it has a kinda-sorta positive description, not really though, but it\u2019s always carrying such a low-vibe when I get it in readings. I always get drawn to the moon in the image and no different than the Peacock does it show that something is being hidden. I think I got this card for Jimin when I did his reading, like while I was shuffling, but I didn\u2019t put it down specifically because I thought it was \u201ctoo on the nose\u201d with the whole light sun/dark sun thing.</p><p>The image on this card is how I see the more domineering side of Taehyung\u2019s core, standing over and in front of the shriveled part which is represented by the half moon in the background. It\u2019s got this sneer on its face and it looks evil as fuck, but like\u2026 it\u2019s kind of there for protection, kind of there to help out, and it\u2019s only appearing evil to those that want it to, like me with my fear of Capricorns, lol.</p><p>So, you can see the more \u201cproductive\u201d side of the dominant core where it\u2019s there to project the faces and keep up appearances with the Peacock, but then the more \u201csinister\u201d side where it\u2019s there to stand guard and hide the more Water fueled part of the core that is hidden away.</p><p>The mixture of Air and Fire is quite interesting as well considering that the most prominent color I saw in the core with the first reading was Red. It\u2019s like the \u201cwork\u201d of the dominant core fuels the fire energy that is used to sort of keep everything on lock. Again, it\u2019s out of protection, but that Fire is drying of the Water energy and that\u2019s why that fragment appears to be shriveled up and small, it\u2019s dehydrated.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"518\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6f2ca8aaaaa55192c0c1dbc28dd0fd0/tumblr_inline_pf91i1X38a1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"518\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Water Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Gazelle - Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>And here we see that his Elemental Water is being filled with Fire. I was getting this more as a need to <i>do</i> rather than <i>feel</i>.</p><p>I talked about this in the last reading, how he will try to do what other people do in order to feel a connection. He doesn\u2019t explore much with his art, instead, he copies classical drawings and paintings and his photography style is paying homage to his favorite photographer. It\u2019s that structure thing where he wants it to look good, so he does what he knows other people already find appealing rather than trying something more outside of the box. I still think he needs to take up painting, like abstract work so that he can have that freedom to create something that can never really look good or bad, it can just simply be.</p><p>This alignment shows that there is a lot of stimulation within that part of the core. (The shriveled part of the core is directly connected to the Water alignment). Just as before, this part of the core is trying to connect, trying to branch out, and it\u2019s coming up in Taehyung\u2019s subconscious and conscious mind as a need to experience a connection with himself and with other people. Like, he\u2019s really, really trying and he\u2019s doing it like he\u2019s connecting just like he wants to, but he can\u2019t <i>feel</i> it because his receptive nature, the Water alignment, the part of his core that is shriveled is not in the game with him.</p><p>Again, this doesn\u2019t make him emotionally dead or incapable of experiencing love or showing love in any way, it\u2019s simply this feeling that something is missing and he can see that other people around him have what he is missing, but he still doesn\u2019t know what it is, because that intuitive nature that would allow him to figure that out and look within himself is not there. Like, he has no Water energy that can actively be used by him in the core. So, he\u2019s going to keep trying to find things to connect with, different mediums of art and expression, and he\u2019s going to try more and more to connect with people on a deeper level and he\u2019ll be able to do it, but he won\u2019t <i>feel</i> it.</p><p>This is also going to be amplified as with the ascension process the receptive nature of people will rise, and for people like Taehyung who carry no Water or have blocked or stunted Water energy in their core it can be quite a maddening experience as you would know there\u2019s something missing but never really be able to figure it out unless someone else pointed it out for you. There could be a sense, potentially, for these people that they are being left behind as the people around them progress on a soul level and expand consciously while they could be doing the exact same thing, but would not <i>feel </i>the ascension taking place.</p><p>Honestly, he just needs to have a deep chat with Yoongi and he\u2019ll be good, lol.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"480\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30db07a94def5502cb3930b4f5f8df6d/tumblr_inline_pf91qmWlA11rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"298\" data-orig-height=\"480\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Fire Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Panther \u2014 Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>Again, it\u2019s very difficult to tell if the dominant part of the core is actually helping or not \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not a good thing because it\u2019s repressing part of the core, but it has \u201cgood intentions\u201d I guess? This here is where the dominant part of the core actually sits. It\u2019s in the Fire alignment which is another receptive energy, but obviously, this is where energy is projected outward more than brought in. This vibes with the Hyena and it\u2019s just so scary to me, but it\u2019s not hurting anything, I think. It\u2019s just like\u2026 overprotective?? I guess??</p><p>No, really though, this is a state of purging, which is a necessary thing in the ascension process (which is why the shriveled bit is trying so hard to get out now) but this is like\u2026 it\u2019s like the dominant part of the core is trying to purge out the shriveled bit entirely. Like, it\u2019s loading up the core with Fire and Earth energy and is trying to completely get rid of that tiny bit of Water energy that is still there.</p><p>OR!! Or it\u2019s more like it\u2019s trying to turn the Water alignment into another Fire alignment like it wants that part of the core to project itself too, but only in the way in which the Sun projects itself, with Fire and heat, the hologram that satisfies others. The Water element is personally gratifying, while the Fire element is for the gratification of other people. Like, it\u2019s trying to burn off any of the \u201cpersonality\u201d that is in there as it\u2019s already been decided within the spirit and the subconscious mind that the main person that is Taehyung is not well liked. Very fucking complicated.</p><p>It\u2019s a pretty gnarly internal situation that is manifesting on the conscious level as this need to simply connect and branch out and express himself more clearly to the people around him. He\u2019s seeking out deeper connections with people, trying to really show love and feel love for his friends and his family which, again, he already does but he thinks he\u2019s not <i>feeling </i>it enough.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"298\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10f6b67ff166c0b55fefb214ec9213ff/tumblr_inline_pf91vpodu21rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"298\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Earth Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Nightingale \u2014 Air</b><br></li><li><b>Crocodile \u2014 Water (reversed)</b><br></li></ul><p>The Earth alignment is where we can see stability, connection the physical space, as well as self-awareness. This right here is literally the \u201cinstability\u201d within his ability to feel coming from the two sides of the core. The Nightingale, the fearless singer who speaks and expresses itself freely, its up against the reversed crocodile where emotion and expression are cold and repressed. It\u2019s going back and forth, teetering back and forth between the two where he wants to let a lot out and be free, but then there\u2019s that subconscious bit that puts fear there and it\u2019s like, \u201cnah, you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>And that Water energy being reversed still shows a lack of Water energy in general. Like, I don\u2019t know where his Water energy is because the shriveled part of the core is completely dry, but it\u2019s still showing as being the receptive and \u201cWater bound\u201d part, so I\u2019m like?? Where\u2019s the Water?? Unless that shriveled part of the core has its own core where the Water is??</p><figure data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d0691211bb41005f720f49d92bb8573/tumblr_inline_pf91yidCgt1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"420\"></figure><p><b>Elemental Air Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Hummingbird \u2014 Air</b><br></li></ul><p>Now, see, this is where his conscious mind is at. This is where his active thought process and communication is coming from. It\u2019s very positive and very not at all seeming to be connected fully or aware of any of the mess in the core. This card is very, very positive, and very happy. This card comes with the keywords, \u201cpositive, enthusiastic, spiritually resourceful, smart, curious, loves to learn\u201d and that\u2019s literally Taehyung. That\u2019s who he is and where most people would recognize that energy.</p><p>This is being directed towards that very clear interest in expressing and getting other people to express with him. I think I talked about it in his last reading or maybe a different reading about how he was matching Yoongi\u2019s energy, or he was trying to mirror Yoongi in a way specifically because he wanted to \u201cget on his level\u201d to try and connect. It\u2019s where that \u201cmirror\u201d thing comes in again, he knows how to use that to his advantage to actually help him make genuine connections with people. This is kind of where the Hummingbird is too in terms of communication, it like hovers at eye-level with anyone it wants to speak with.</p><p>This is also a card of creativity and exploration, which lends to his artistry and him trying his hand at many different forms of art, both taking inspiration from some people and then putting his own spin on it. I mean, just like in his last reading we can see the disconnect between the conscious mind and literally everything else. Of course, he is still influenced by everything just like everyone else in the world is, but his awareness of it is not quite there and I imagine he might have difficulty doing some self-processing. Like, sitting down and just being within the self could be difficult for him, but that can actually be done through projection as well like WITH ABSTRACT PAINTING where he can put something out on a canvas or paper with no real guidelines, no image in mind, and just <i>feel </i>something into the painting and, from there, physically see what his subconscious has put out there for him to see.</p><p>Painting and drawing things in an abstract manner is a great way for people who are not very receptive to channel through the subconscious mind.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"295\" data-orig-height=\"488\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6e329a986a3d0249a4d33b80afcb2e/tumblr_inline_pf924ue19r1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"295\" data-orig-height=\"488\"></figure><p><b>Higher Self Core State:</b></p><ul><li><b>Tiger \u2014 Fire</b><br></li></ul><p>This is dope as hell.</p><p>Okay, so the Higher Self, which would be within the energy center in the Soul Body is currently trying to shove this energy into the core to replace the Peacock and the Hyena. Do you know what this fucking card is???? It\u2019s lunar force, it\u2019s Water and Fire mixed, it\u2019s balanced reception and projection. Like, how fucking perfect is that??</p><p>Literally, this is just balanced all the way around, it\u2019s feminine energy, receptive energy, and WATER energy all coming in and just like clearing things out and letting everything settle so that the shriveled bit won\u2019t be so shriveled anymore, but the projected Fire will still be there to, you know, <i>project</i>.</p><p>This energy is very balanced and very confident and sure of itself, which is really what he needs on a core level. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really going to have time, or even a way at all really, to work through the root cause of this imbalance, but I think with the ascension process this is going to be a forced balance, like it\u2019s just going to occur, a bit of Divine Intervention there. I think I talked about that in the OT7 2018/2019 Outlook reading, about how forced balance could occur, but that was for all of them and that was when the Soul Body was still being fucked with so, who knows.</p><p>Overall, most of Taehyung\u2019s imbalances stem from spirit pollution that came from the subconscious mind and fragmented the core so that the receptive and emotional side, that could have already been brittle, broke off and was locked away. This response from the core to do this comes from the influence of the energy center and its position in the Soul Body as its main focus is the mental perception of the spectator. For Taehyung, his connection and alignment with all of the layers of his own personal Soul Body is very not at all strong or clear, but they still affect him on each level and manifest in ways that can have him contradicting himself or simply being confused by himself, confused about what he wants and what he feels he is missing.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a huge deal though, most of the imbalance is purely in the core and it has nothing to do with low-vibe influence, it is simply how he is on that level. Consciously, he struggles with it, but not in a way where he is experiencing breakdowns or showing any real instability. It\u2019s just some \u201cI need to find myself\u201d kind of vibes there on that level that most people in their 20\u2032s experience.</p><p>He\u2019ll level out at some point, but I think the process would speed up a bit if he would do some ABSTRACT PAINTING PLEASE I\u2019VE BEEN SEEING THAT FOR HIM FOR MONTHS NOW OMG.</p><p>Okay, bye.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBlueMoonPunch&amp;t=MmYxMGM2MGVmZmU0MTUyYzk4YTIyNDIwOTU3N2IwMDEyNDEzZDk5NCxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">SHOP</a> | <a href=\"http://mopoglo.tumblr.com/\">MAIN BLOG</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbluemoonpunch%2F&amp;t=MjM2NjhmNzYzY2VmMjI0YWE3NzhjMWQyMzE4ZDRjOTFkNDM4ODJjMyxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">INSTA</a> | <a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/176169780918/idolcelebrity-readings-list\">MORE BTS READINGS</a></b><br></p></p>",

He almost acts as a mirror and he can reflect anything you need him to and I think that the general state of his&nbsp;being comes from his place in the Soul Body and how his energy center functions. It&rsquo;s a great balancing energy that stems from Jin&rsquo;s energy center and Kook&rsquo;s energy center that sits on either side of Taehyung&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s more about the frequency output of the Soul Body, which he and Kook rule over, but it&rsquo;s a bit more clear to me now that Taehyung handles the mental perception while Kook handles the physical.</p><p>This is all well and good, but as we know, the energy center, the core, the soul, the spirit, the projected energy, the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind, and the conscious mind are all separate things and often act independently of the others and balance really relies on the conscious mind <i>consciously</i> aligning with everything else. For Taehyung there&rsquo;s a bit of &ldquo;bloop&rdquo; in the stability between how his core energy connects to his sub and unconscious mind through the Spirit. His core energy is fully &ldquo;enrobed&rdquo; in the energy center, but it&rsquo;s broken apart just as I was seeing it with the whole 700 faces thing.<br /></p><p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b><br /></p><p>The 700 faces thing is not a makeup of his core, it&rsquo;s actually a product of the somewhat negative connection between his subconscious and unconscious mind with his spirit. I&rsquo;ve made a post explaining the layers of energy and how they influence each other, so if you would like to read that real quick it&rsquo;s right <b><a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/177216069643/hi-could-you-perhaps-explain-the-distinction\">here</a>.</b></p><p>Basically, Taehyung has some issues with self-perception that stem from relatively simple things that really don&rsquo;t register that often in the conscious mind, but have been amplified by the core energy and its need to reflect what other people see in him. There&rsquo;s a conflict there between this unconscious need to fit everyone&rsquo;s perception while there is a more conscious effort to be an individual and be stable within himself and his own understanding of himself. The need to find creative outlets, as I mentioned in his previous reading, comes from this need to connect with his &ldquo;real self&rdquo; but he&rsquo;s not even aware that there is a difference between who he portrays and who he is internally within his core.</p><p>The reason for that is that his core consciousness, like his &ldquo;soul&rdquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m mean it&rsquo;s not really his soul, it&rsquo;s part of his core, but it&rsquo;s not the whole core&hellip; very difficult to explain &mdash; anyway, his core consciousness is trying to reconnect and reestablish balance within Taehyung&rsquo;s core, but it can&rsquo;t really do that because it&rsquo;s all shriveled up and shoved in a closet, or at least that&rsquo;s how I was seeing it. This part of Taehyung is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Taehyung in a sense, it&rsquo;s where his emotional center is and only when he is deeply upset does it actually come out, but even then his expression is relatively contained and the core doesn&rsquo;t get to see the light of day.</p><p>The reason this piece of his core is even hidden away in the first place has to do with a &ldquo;polluted&rdquo; spirit that is being influenced by subconscious knowledge of his physical appearance. To me, something like this doesn&rsquo;t seem very serious, and I suppose it isn&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s not a huge issue that he deals with or that cripples him the way his core state would make it seem, but it does impact him. It comes from some of the stuff that I removed from the original&nbsp;reading so it would be a bit difficult to explain where exactly it stems from, but whatever right, people will get pissed about it no matter what because god forbid anyone ever assume that a human being is flawed in some way, lol.</p><p>So, this little piece of his core energy is hidden away, lost, paranoid, and very discouraged when it comes to being seen by people &mdash; this manifests in a more controlled expression which can sometimes come off as constantly acting or playing a character, exaggerated expressions, or seeming to drop emotions very quickly and replace them with others. Like I said in the last reading, this actually makes him a great actor in general, just being able to turn on and off his own feelings and portray his &ldquo;faces&rdquo; so vividly that it can seem like he just has a natural born talent.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/386e2b60a3208e9924f2934cf7463f35/tumblr_inline_pf90p1TO4B1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Just to kind of get an image of his energy, to really see where things are laid out for that small piece of the core rather than the overpowering piece, I pulled some cards to sort of lay things out.</p><p>The 5 of Swords and the Ace of Wands just shows how the more domineering side of the core is projecting over the fragmented part of the core.</p><p>The reversed Six of Cups shows why that little piece of the core, which rules over all of his Water energy, was broken off and hidden away. It falls down into the 9 of Wands and the 5 of Cups which holds true to the current state of this one piece of his core. This is where that piece is hidden, it&rsquo;s kind of underneath those energies. The fact that this happened was more so bloomed from people not liking his personality in the beginning (conscious level) and it quite literally, in a sense, traumatized him because of how his perception of himself works stemming from the 6 of Cups, and it caused him to repress that emotional, creative, expressive nature where he is 100% himself and not so controlled. If you are not able to see how much he actually controls and calculates his expression whether it be on an emotional front or with his artwork, then you really are not paying attention and have no concept of people past their projected personas&hellip; or you have an image in your head of him and your perception is being fueled by one of the many faces he has, which means you probably have a view of him that differs greatly from many other people, not just me.</p><p>So, he was actually pretty stable within himself because he just kind of grew out of the issues with his sense of self-worth, but it all came rushing back when he was put out there for the world to see. He was actually rather confident with himself and it feels like he took it as an opportunity to &ldquo;turn up the volume&rdquo; on his more creative and &ldquo;out there&rdquo; personality because he was expecting to stand out and have so many more people to relate to him and find him funny or interesting. But what happened is that people were laughing at him rather than with him, that is why he expressed that he doesn&rsquo;t like to be called &ldquo;alien&rdquo; or &ldquo;4D&rdquo; or whatever else, it actually cuts him deep down, because he was trying to put his personality over his appearance, but when he did he was &ldquo;seen&rdquo; in a negative light which, as I mentioned, brought all of that insecurity and put more importance on his appearance as well as how his personality is seen by other people.&nbsp;</p><p>That does not mean he is emotionally dead or that he operates like a robot, it means that he tends to &ldquo;run through his script&rdquo; before really projecting anything, and that is more subconscious. Literally, I was hearing a countdown happening before he speaks and that&rsquo;s kind of the vibe there, he&rsquo;s planning his actions so that he can fit the mold.</p><p>This here leads to The Chariot, The Moon, and Strength to be reversed energies within this piece of his core. The reversed Chariot is really that sudden stop in his expression, where a dam was built up around that water and it now has to be strained and filtered shot glass by shot glass before it can be filtered again through the spirit, then again through the different layers of the mind, and finally it is then expressed in a manner that he is most comfortable with on a conscious level. The Moon reversed is showing how this state of his core and his subconscious mind kind of toss the ball back and forth, both kind of depleting each other and validating those insecurities over and over again, while on a conscious level Taehyung is not really aware that this is happening, but he <i>feels</i> the imbalance and the disconnect within himself for which he tries to compensate with his creative exploration in art. Strength being reversed is just that depletion within that part of the core, why it is so frail and shriveled looking, hidden away and drying up from the lack of Water stimulation within the core.</p><p>The core is then projected through the Sun card and usually, the Sun card is seen as one of the most positive cards in the deck, but here it really wasn&rsquo;t it settling like that. The reason for that is because I couldn&rsquo;t see the child on the card, the one enjoying the freedom happiness, basking in the sunlight and the sunflowers, as Taehyung. Instead, I was seeing Taehyung as the Sun in the image, with the blank and neutral expression, while <i>we</i> as the audience are the child in the image.</p><p>We as the audience only find joy and satisfaction in this sunshine projection, this hologram of a person that we want to focus on because it&rsquo;s much easier to idolize someone if we are under the assumption that they are <i>idols</i> and not human beings with flaws and insecurities. If we see them as being human, we see them as being equal to us, in which case resentment can actually occur within some people as they start to project their own insecurities onto them by suddenly hating the fact that another human being is successful and talented. It&rsquo;s like seeing someone famous as being equal to you, only stands to point out how unequal you actually are on a social level. There&rsquo;s an awareness of that and a fear in that. From there you get the angry people who rush to the defense of their idols when such an awful insult such as having emotions or being human is suggested on their behalf because that Sun image is being stripped away and, of course, it helps them feel like they matter in some way to the idolized Sun by coming to their defense. Kind of like brainwashed cult followers with no perception of anything past what they are spoon fed&hellip; amazing.</p><p>The projected sunlight that the child on the card is basking in isn&rsquo;t even appreciated, it&rsquo;s just something that&rsquo;s there and as far as the child knows, it&rsquo;s always been there, it&rsquo;s always going to be there, because whenever the Sun is gone the child doesn&rsquo;t even notice because that is when they go to sleep. They pay no mind to the moments in which the Sun is not there because all they actually care about is the Sun and the Sun&rsquo;s light, nothing else.&nbsp;</p><p>To assume Taehyung, or any of the members, have no flaws or insecurities that affect them deeply and to assume that what they show you is all there is to be seen, is no different than assuming that the Sun never sets.</p><p><b>The Reading</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ca9b017ae4f562c9d2c1c64f459a2c9/tumblr_inline_pf91ccnCxX1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Current State of Core Energy:</b></p><ul><li><b>Peacock &mdash; Air</b><br /></li><li><b>Hyena &mdash; Fire</b><br /></li></ul><p>I mean&hellip;</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve read Jimin&rsquo;s reading then you know how I feel about the Peacock card, and the Hyena card is really no different. The Peacock card always comes up when there is a conscious effort to mask something within yourself. This came up for Jimin in his core as well, and the Hyena would be one that I would also associate with him. Actually, Hoseok, Jimin, and Taehyung have that same sort of &ldquo;mask&rdquo; vibe, but they have different levels of it as well as different areas that they wish to hide.</p><p>The Peacock is the projected energy of the more domineering part of Taehyung&rsquo;s core, which would be the one I was mostly feeling in Part 1 of this reading. It&rsquo;s the part that projects all of the different faces and allows the other part of the core to hide out. It&rsquo;s a bit difficult even now to really tell if the more domineering part is actually forcing that energy down, or if it&rsquo;s supposed to be protecting it. Either way, this side of him is the one putting on the show.</p><p>The Hyena is always a weird card for me because it has a kinda-sorta positive description, not really though, but it&rsquo;s always carrying such a low-vibe when I get it in readings. I always get drawn to the moon in the image and no different than the Peacock does it show that something is being hidden. I think I got this card for Jimin when I did his reading, like while I was shuffling, but I didn&rsquo;t put it down specifically because I thought it was &ldquo;too on the nose&rdquo; with the whole light sun/dark sun thing.</p><p>The image on this card is how I see the more domineering side of Taehyung&rsquo;s core, standing over and in front of the shriveled part which is represented by the half moon in the background. It&rsquo;s got this sneer on its face and it looks evil as fuck, but like&hellip; it&rsquo;s kind of there for protection, kind of there to help out, and it&rsquo;s only appearing evil to those that want it to, like me with my fear of Capricorns, lol.</p><p>So, you can see the more &ldquo;productive&rdquo; side of the dominant core where it&rsquo;s there to project the faces and keep up appearances with the Peacock, but then the more &ldquo;sinister&rdquo; side where it&rsquo;s there to stand guard and hide the more Water fueled part of the core that is hidden away.</p><p>The mixture of Air and Fire is quite interesting as well considering that the most prominent color I saw in the core with the first reading was Red. It&rsquo;s like the &ldquo;work&rdquo; of the dominant core fuels the fire energy that is used to sort of keep everything on lock. Again, it&rsquo;s out of protection, but that Fire is drying of the Water energy and that&rsquo;s why that fragment appears to be shriveled up and small, it&rsquo;s dehydrated.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6f2ca8aaaaa55192c0c1dbc28dd0fd0/tumblr_inline_pf91i1X38a1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Water Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Gazelle - Fire</b><br /></li></ul><p>And here we see that his Elemental Water is being filled with Fire. I was getting this more as a need to <i>do</i> rather than <i>feel</i>.</p><p>I talked about this in the last reading, how he will try to do what other people do in order to feel a connection. He doesn&rsquo;t explore much with his art, instead, he copies classical drawings and paintings and his photography style is paying homage to his favorite photographer. It&rsquo;s that structure thing where he wants it to look good, so he does what he knows other people already find appealing rather than trying something more outside of the box. I still think he needs to take up painting, like abstract work so that he can have that freedom to create something that can never really look good or bad, it can just simply be.</p><p>This alignment shows that there is a lot of stimulation within that part of the core. (The shriveled part of the core is directly connected to the Water alignment). Just as before, this part of the core is trying to connect, trying to branch out, and it&rsquo;s coming up in Taehyung&rsquo;s subconscious and conscious mind as a need to experience a connection with himself and with other people. Like, he&rsquo;s really, really trying and he&rsquo;s doing it like he&rsquo;s connecting just like he wants to, but he can&rsquo;t <i>feel</i> it because his receptive nature, the Water alignment, the part of his core that is shriveled is not in the game with him.</p><p>Again, this doesn&rsquo;t make him emotionally dead or incapable of experiencing love or showing love in any way, it&rsquo;s simply this feeling that something is missing and he can see that other people around him have what he is missing, but he still doesn&rsquo;t know what it is, because that intuitive nature that would allow him to figure that out and look within himself is not there. Like, he has no Water energy that can actively be used by him in the core. So, he&rsquo;s going to keep trying to find things to connect with, different mediums of art and expression, and he&rsquo;s going to try more and more to connect with people on a deeper level and he&rsquo;ll be able to do it, but he won&rsquo;t <i>feel</i> it.</p><p>This is also going to be amplified as with the ascension process the receptive nature of people will rise, and for people like Taehyung who carry no Water or have blocked or stunted Water energy in their core it can be quite a maddening experience as you would know there&rsquo;s something missing but never really be able to figure it out unless someone else pointed it out for you. There could be a sense, potentially, for these people that they are being left behind as the people around them progress on a soul level and expand consciously while they could be doing the exact same thing, but would not <i>feel </i>the ascension taking place.</p><p>Honestly, he just needs to have a deep chat with Yoongi and he&rsquo;ll be good, lol.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30db07a94def5502cb3930b4f5f8df6d/tumblr_inline_pf91qmWlA11rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Fire Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Panther &mdash; Fire</b><br /></li></ul><p>Again, it&rsquo;s very difficult to tell if the dominant part of the core is actually helping or not &mdash; I mean, it&rsquo;s not a good thing because it&rsquo;s repressing part of the core, but it has &ldquo;good intentions&rdquo; I guess? This here is where the dominant part of the core actually sits. It&rsquo;s in the Fire alignment which is another receptive energy, but obviously, this is where energy is projected outward more than brought in. This vibes with the Hyena and it&rsquo;s just so scary to me, but it&rsquo;s not hurting anything, I think. It&rsquo;s just like&hellip; overprotective?? I guess??</p><p>No, really though, this is a state of purging, which is a necessary thing in the ascension process (which is why the shriveled bit is trying so hard to get out now) but this is like&hellip; it&rsquo;s like the dominant part of the core is trying to purge out the shriveled bit entirely. Like, it&rsquo;s loading up the core with Fire and Earth energy and is trying to completely get rid of that tiny bit of Water energy that is still there.</p><p>OR!! Or it&rsquo;s more like it&rsquo;s trying to turn the Water alignment into another Fire alignment like it wants that part of the core to project itself too, but only in the way in which the Sun projects itself, with Fire and heat, the hologram that satisfies others. The Water element is personally gratifying, while the Fire element is for the gratification of other people. Like, it&rsquo;s trying to burn off any of the &ldquo;personality&rdquo; that is in there as it&rsquo;s already been decided within the spirit and the subconscious mind that the main person that is Taehyung is not well liked. Very fucking complicated.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a pretty gnarly internal situation that is manifesting on the conscious level as this need to simply connect and branch out and express himself more clearly to the people around him. He&rsquo;s seeking out deeper connections with people, trying to really show love and feel love for his friends and his family which, again, he already does but he thinks he&rsquo;s not <i>feeling </i>it enough.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/10f6b67ff166c0b55fefb214ec9213ff/tumblr_inline_pf91vpodu21rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Earth Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Nightingale &mdash; Air</b><br /></li><li><b>Crocodile &mdash; Water (reversed)</b><br /></li></ul><p>The Earth alignment is where we can see stability, connection the physical space, as well as self-awareness.

The Nightingale, the fearless singer who speaks and expresses itself freely, its up against the reversed crocodile where emotion and expression are cold and repressed. It&rsquo;s going back and forth, teetering back and forth between the two where he wants to let a lot out and be free, but then there&rsquo;s that subconscious bit that puts fear there and it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;nah, you don&rsquo;t want to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>And that Water energy being reversed still shows a lack of Water energy in general. Like, I don&rsquo;t know where his Water energy is because the shriveled part of the core is completely dry, but it&rsquo;s still showing as being the receptive and &ldquo;Water bound&rdquo; part, so I&rsquo;m like?? Where&rsquo;s the Water?? Unless that shriveled part of the core has its own core where the Water is??</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d0691211bb41005f720f49d92bb8573/tumblr_inline_pf91yidCgt1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Elemental Air Alignment:</b></p><ul><li><b>Hummingbird &mdash; Air</b><br /></li></ul><p>Now, see, this is where his conscious mind is at. This is where his active thought process and communication is coming from. It&rsquo;s very positive and very not at all seeming to be connected fully or aware of any of the mess in the core. This card is very, very positive, and very happy. This card comes with the keywords, &ldquo;positive, enthusiastic, spiritually resourceful, smart, curious, loves to learn&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s literally Taehyung. That&rsquo;s who he is and where most people would recognize that energy.</p><p>This is being directed towards that very clear interest in expressing and getting other people to express with him. I think I talked about it in his last reading or maybe a different reading about how he was matching Yoongi&rsquo;s energy, or he was trying to mirror Yoongi in a way specifically because he wanted to &ldquo;get on his level&rdquo; to try and connect. It&rsquo;s where that &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; thing comes in again, he knows how to use that to his advantage to actually help him make genuine connections with people. This is kind of where the Hummingbird is too in terms of communication, it like hovers at eye-level with anyone it wants to speak with.</p><p>This is also a card of creativity and exploration, which lends to his artistry and him trying his hand at many different forms of art, both taking inspiration from some people and then putting his own spin on it. I mean, just like in his last reading we can see the disconnect between the conscious mind and literally everything else. Of course, he is still influenced by everything just like everyone else in the world is, but his awareness of it is not quite there and I imagine he might have difficulty doing some self-processing. Like, sitting down and just being within the self could be difficult for him, but that can actually be done through projection as well like WITH ABSTRACT PAINTING where he can put something out on a canvas or paper with no real guidelines, no image in mind, and just <i>feel </i>something into the painting and, from there, physically see what his subconscious has put out there for him to see.</p><p>Painting and drawing things in an abstract manner is a great way for people who are not very receptive to channel through the subconscious mind.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6e329a986a3d0249a4d33b80afcb2e/tumblr_inline_pf924ue19r1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Higher Self Core State:</b></p><ul><li><b>Tiger &mdash; Fire</b><br /></li></ul><p>This is dope as hell.</p><p>Okay, so the Higher Self, which would be within the energy center in the Soul Body is currently trying to shove this energy into the core to replace the Peacock and the Hyena. Do you know what this fucking card is???? It&rsquo;s lunar force, it&rsquo;s Water and Fire mixed, it&rsquo;s balanced reception and projection. Like, how fucking perfect is that??</p><p>Literally, this is just balanced all the way around, it&rsquo;s feminine energy, receptive energy, and WATER energy all coming in and just like clearing things out and letting everything settle so that the shriveled bit won&rsquo;t be so shriveled anymore, but the projected Fire will still be there to, you know, <i>project</i>.</p><p>This energy is very balanced and very confident and sure of itself, which is really what he needs on a core level. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really going to have time, or even a way at all really, to work through the root cause of this imbalance, but I think with the ascension process this is going to be a forced balance, like it&rsquo;s just going to occur, a bit of Divine Intervention there. I think I talked about that in the OT7 2018/2019 Outlook reading, about how forced balance could occur, but that was for all of them and that was when the Soul Body was still being fucked with so, who knows.</p><p>Overall, most of Taehyung&rsquo;s imbalances stem from spirit pollution that came from the subconscious mind and fragmented the core so that the receptive and emotional side, that could have already been brittle, broke off and was locked away. This response from the core to do this comes from the influence of the energy center and its position in the Soul Body as its main focus is the mental perception of the spectator. For Taehyung, his connection and alignment with all of the layers of his own personal Soul Body is very not at all strong or clear, but they still affect him on each level and manifest in ways that can have him contradicting himself or simply being confused by himself, confused about what he wants and what he feels he is missing.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t a huge deal though, most of the imbalance is purely in the core and it has nothing to do with low-vibe influence, it is simply how he is on that level. Consciously, he struggles with it, but not in a way where he is experiencing breakdowns or showing any real instability. It&rsquo;s just some &ldquo;I need to find myself&rdquo; kind of vibes there on that level that most people in their 20&prime;s experience.</p><p>He&rsquo;ll level out at some point, but I think the process would speed up a bit if he would do some ABSTRACT PAINTING PLEASE I&rsquo;VE BEEN SEEING THAT FOR HIM FOR MONTHS NOW OMG.</p><p>Okay, bye.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBlueMoonPunch&amp;t=MmYxMGM2MGVmZmU0MTUyYzk4YTIyNDIwOTU3N2IwMDEyNDEzZDk5NCxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">SHOP</a> | <a href=\"http://mopoglo.tumblr.com/\">MAIN BLOG</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbluemoonpunch%2F&amp;t=MjM2NjhmNzYzY2VmMjI0YWE3NzhjMWQyMzE4ZDRjOTFkNDM4ODJjMyxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">INSTA</a> | <a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/176169780918/idolcelebrity-readings-list\">MORE BTS READINGS</a></b><br /></p></p>",

He almost acts as a mirror and he can reflect anything you need him to and I think that the general state of his&nbsp;being comes from his place in the Soul Body and how his energy center functions. It&rsquo;s a great balancing energy that stems from Jin&rsquo;s energy center and Kook&rsquo;s energy center that sits on either side of Taehyung&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s more about the frequency output of the Soul Body, which he and Kook rule over, but it&rsquo;s a bit more clear to me now that Taehyung handles the mental perception while Kook handles the physical.</p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but as we know, the energy center, the core, the soul, the spirit, the projected energy, the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind, and the conscious mind are all separate things and often act independently of the others and balance really relies on the conscious mind <i>consciously</i> aligning with everything else. For Taehyung there&rsquo;s a bit of &ldquo;bloop&rdquo; in the stability between how his core energy connects to his sub and unconscious mind through the Spirit. His core energy is fully &ldquo;enrobed&rdquo; in the energy center, but it&rsquo;s broken apart just as I was seeing it with the whole 700 faces thing.<br /></p>\n<p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b><br /></p>\n</p>",
