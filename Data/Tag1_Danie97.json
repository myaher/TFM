Phil is much better at compartmentalizing, whereas Dan tends to let things consume him, and I think that\u2019s why it might seem like he is better at managing his mind and emotions than Dan, but he is also not very comfortable sharing anything that isn\u2019t positive and agreeable and isn\u2019t able to push himself out of his comfort zone or give up control nearly as easily as Dan. Phil tends to avoid \u201cnegative\u201d emotions, whereas Dan tends to lean into them. One example of this is Phil saying that he was too sensitive to watch The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The show is pretty harrowing, but it\u2019s no more violent or graphic sexually than Game of Thrones, which he loves. The reason The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is uncomfortable to watch at times is because it forces us to confront things about our own society and where we could end up if they are allowed to go unchecked. I actually think their philosophies when it comes to playing video games, as seen on the gaming channel, demonstrate their differences pretty well. When a game is difficult and frustrating, Phils reaction more often than not seems to be to give up and move onto something else, whereas Dan tends to get more determined and committed. Dan\u2019s philosophy is more likely to lead to progress and achievement, but also more likely to drive him crazy in the process. I don\u2019t think either way is better, just different.</p>",

They are very different people and have different strengths and weaknesses, but I wouldn\u2019t say one way is inherently better than the other. Phil is much better at compartmentalizing, whereas Dan tends to let things consume him, and I think that\u2019s why it might seem like he is better at managing his mind and emotions than Dan, but he is also not very comfortable sharing anything that isn\u2019t positive and agreeable and isn\u2019t able to push himself out of his comfort zone or give up control nearly as easily as Dan. Phil tends to avoid \u201cnegative\u201d emotions, whereas Dan tends to lean into them. One example of this is Phil saying that he was too sensitive to watch The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The show is pretty harrowing, but it\u2019s no more violent or graphic sexually than Game of Thrones, which he loves. The reason The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is uncomfortable to watch at times is because it forces us to confront things about our own society and where we could end up if they are allowed to go unchecked. I actually think their philosophies when it comes to playing video games, as seen on the gaming channel, demonstrate their differences pretty well. When a game is difficult and frustrating, Phils reaction more often than not seems to be to give up and move onto something else, whereas Dan tends to get more determined and committed. Dan\u2019s philosophy is more likely to lead to progress and achievement, but also more likely to drive him crazy in the process. I don\u2019t think either way is better, just different.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>This is a really hard question for me to answer because, since I don\u2019t know what Dan is up to, I don\u2019t really have any information to serve as the basis for speculation. People have a lot of theories about why Dan is absent from social media, but I always end up going back to what he said in the mukbang video about going through a period of personal growth and that he feels that he needs to do that on his own, without sharing it, in order to do it effectively. </p><p>When I was studying psychology, I learned a lot about how damaging judgement, even positive judgement, can be and if you think about it, Dan has spent his entire adult life being in an environment where he has been judged and either rewarded handsomely or punished harshly for almost everything he\u2019s done, socially and monitarily. He has learned how to act in a way that he knows will get attention and approval and, going back to the mukbang, that\u2019s why it really made me a bit sad for him when he spoke about feeling like he doesn\u2019t have a personality, because it must be confusing to wonder if you are doing things because you actually want to or because you like the feeling that you get from clicks and likes and views (and money) on social media (it can be for me and I\u2019m not even famous). </p><p>Dan has never really had a chance to explore who he wants to be without us there praising or condemning him and I think, at least I hope, that maybe he didn\u2019t expect his break from social media to last this long, but is enjoying going through the process of getting to know himself without us standing over his shoulders hoping and praying that he makes choices in line with who we want him to be. That\u2019s a lot of pressure. For example, it a small thing, but it has always made me uncomfortable how much people push Dan to wear nail polish because I could never tell if it\u2019s something he actually wanted to be doing or if it\u2019s something he is doing to make others happy. On the other hand, I watched the Danmails again recently and saw how genuinely excited he was to get his iconic llama hat. He said that he had always wanted one, but didn\u2019t think he should have one since he was a boy, but was going to wear it because someone sent it to him and he liked it. If Dan does come back, I really hope to see more of him being really excited to express himself as he is and people being supportive of that. </p><p>I don\u2019t know how long it will take him to get to that point, but he did spend the last couple of years catering to who people wanted him to be and even acted it out on tour. I think he more than deserves to get to be who he wants to be now and, as much as I\u2019d miss him, if he decides that he will never be able to do that continuing on YouTube or as a public figure, I will support that because it is his life and he only gets one and he needs to make himself happy, not us. Personally, I just try not to really have any expectations for him to come back, so that way I\u2019m not disappointed. I hope he does though!</p>",
