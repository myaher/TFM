It\u2019ll only make sense if you\u2019ve \nseen the movie, and if you haven\u2019t seen the movie it will definitely \nspoil you for it.

The \nsurviving ships are a ragtag band of soldiers and civilians and \ncivilians that became soldiers out of need. The trouble is, most of the \nfighter pilots are dead or wounded. Captain Rogers has to train a batch \nof newly drafted cadets and turn them into decent pilots in no time.

He tries an arm around his waist, firm, \nsolid, hot. Tony is hard and it\u2019s obvious. He thinks he\u2019d be more of a \ngentleman about it under normal circumstances, but in this place, it\u2019s \nlike a handshake.He shudders and his back muscles move beneath \nTony\u2019s hand. Tony\u2019s pants grow tighter. He smells like Barbasol. A \nwell-respected man.
