        "answer": "<p>Lol I wish we&rsquo;d get the real Bran back. I have no idea what he&rsquo;s going to be doing because he&rsquo;s got these amazing magical skills and those have to be essential to defeating the WW BUT the production doesn&rsquo;t appear to get that. Or care. Because so far they&rsquo;ve literally just used him for flashbacks (and there&rsquo;s fans trying to construe that this is because R+L=J must be like essential to the endgame when it&rsquo;s really not it&rsquo;s just something D&amp;D fixate on and for whatever reason they didn&rsquo;t want Bran doing his own thing, maybe it had to do with the budget or it would add &ldquo;too much confusion&rdquo;). The scene when he&rsquo;s shown the apparent origins of the NK is literally the only time they&rsquo;ve gotten close to his real mission. I believe they&rsquo;ll throw in something for him to do magically during the battle but it&rsquo;s not going to make a ton of sense or be as important as whatever book!bran is going to do. But mostly he&rsquo;ll be relegated to the background and only brought forward to talk about R+L or to creep someone out. Isaac has said he&rsquo;ll be a little more of a person this year but I 1) don&rsquo;t trust Isaac, 2) don&rsquo;t trust the show (ex he could have been in a bunch of humanizing and interesting scenes that will have been cut like that one time he was plot relevant last season that got cut).</p><p>I know I&rsquo;m being a pessimist but this is the only way I can deal with the show.</p><p><i>Thanks for talking to me!</i></p>",
