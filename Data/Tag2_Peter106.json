        "body": "<p><b>Just something random that I came up with from a silly headcanon. Enjoy! Also will be posted on Ao3.</b></p><hr><p>It started as a joke.\u00a0</p><p>Peter and Ned were sitting in their freshman year math class, when their teacher promised a slice of pie for the student who could recite the most digits of Pi. Peter wasn&rsquo;t even interested in doing it, until Flash bragged that he was going to win.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t even memorize two digits, Penis!&rdquo; Flash yelled at him from across the table at Decathlon practice. So Peter decided to try because pie was good, but beating Flash was better.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I bet one of us could win,&rdquo; Ned said, as they hung out in May&rsquo;s apartment later that evening. Peter was reading through numbers memorizing them.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty is probably enough right?&rdquo; Peter asked looking away from his computer. &ldquo;Flash isn&rsquo;t that patient.&rdquo; Ned chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I know twenty one already,&rdquo; Ned said with a shrug. &ldquo;But twenty is probably enough if you want to beat Flash.&rdquo; Peter smirked.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Oh so you&rsquo;re going to win?&rdquo; He asked with a chuckle. Ned shrugged and the chuckle slipped away from his lips. &ldquo;Dude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bro, Mrs. Simmons makes a mean apple pie,&rdquo; Ned said with a shrug. &ldquo;Besides, we both know I&rsquo;m the less forgetful one of the two of us.&rdquo; Peter wanted to be offended, but also wondered if his friend was kidding.</p><p>&ldquo;So list them then,&rdquo; He said with a smirk. &ldquo;If you know twenty one digits of Pi.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>&ldquo;3.141592653589793238462.&rdquo; Ned said with a smug smirk.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh dude, it&rsquo;s so on.&rdquo; Peter said, before spinning back around to his computer. Ned chuckled, but then when Peter didn&rsquo;t respond, quickly pulled his phone out to begin memorizing more digits of Pi.<br/></p><p>The day of the competition, Flash got barely twelve digits before quitting. Peter recited twenty two digits of Pi, a proud look on his face. Even his teacher was impressed. Until Ned went up. And recited twenty four digits. And won the slice of apple pie.</p><p>&ldquo;Told you dude,&rdquo; Ned said, sitting back down to Peter and digging into his slice of pie.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Oh now it&rsquo;s really on.&rdquo;</p><p>Which was how, almost a year later, Peter found himself reciting digits of Pi to himself, while he worked on his suit. He worked in Tony&rsquo;s lab once a week, usually on a Wednesday. Normally, he wouldn&rsquo;t be memorizing digits, especially in front of his mentor, but between Decathlon and being Spider-Man, he hadn&rsquo;t much time to practice.\u00a0</p><p>To Tony, the kid looked crazy. He was mumbling to himself as he worked. He was normally the chattiest kid on the planet. He could talk Tony&rsquo;s ear off any day of the week. But today, it was just mumbles. And from what Tony was picking up, it sounded like numbers.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright kid, what gives?&rdquo; Peter looked up from his work, a sheepish smile on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Mr. Stark,&rdquo; Peter said, his ears burning in embarrassment. &ldquo;I can stop, if it&rsquo;s annoying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it that you&rsquo;re even doing?&rdquo; Tony asked, pulling up a stool and sitting next to Peter. Peter&rsquo;s ears just burned even more. So now he was going to have to explain this. To Tony Stark. He was going to die of embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;Well um,&rdquo; Peter started, balling up the sleeves of his sweatshirt around his fists. &ldquo;The math teacher at my school gives a piece of pie to the person who can memorize the most digits and recite them on Pi Day.&rdquo; Tony raised an eyebrow.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re doing this for a piece of pie?&rdquo; Peter shrugged, still embarrassed.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly I know.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s facial expression changed and he shrugged. &ldquo;And originally it was just supposed to be fun. But Ned memorized twenty two digits last year! And the pie he got looked so good and I really, really want to win.&rdquo; Tony stared at the kid. Peter stared back at his mentor, wondering what the Tony Stark could possibly could be thinking about this stupid thing he was doing. <br/><br/>And then Tony chuckled. He shook his head and chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Better be some good pie,&rdquo; Tony said. Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened a little in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s stupid?&rdquo; Peter asked, feeling a little less embarrassed.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid the kinds of things I did to win a competition against Rhodey would make you blush,&rdquo; Tony said. Peter chuckled awkwardly, not really wanting to hear any of that. He&rsquo;d read enough about Tony Stark over the course of his life that he could only imagine the kinds of stories had. &ldquo;How about I help you?&rdquo; A wide grin crossed Peter&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He asked, his brown eyes widened. To Tony, it looked strangely adorable. The kid acted like a puppy half the time anyways.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; So the two sat there for the rest of Peter&rsquo;s time there, memorizing and reciting digits of pie.</p><hr><p>Tony sat in his workshop on Pi Day. He had spent a few hours rehearsing digits with Peter, that he had been practicing them himself the rest of the evening. Pepper was amused, especially when she heard it was because of the kid. She teased him about how differently he acted around the kid, but he always just waved her off or silenced his fiancee with a kiss. And who cared if he was a bit of a softie around Peter? The kid was smart and good at being Spider-Man (when he wasn&rsquo;t taking on bad guys beyond his skill set).\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter ran into the lab, his backpack on one shoulder and a plastic bag in the other hand. Tony had invited the kid to come back that day. They hadn&rsquo;t finished upgrading his suit and Tony kind of wanted to know if the kid won. He had been so excited about it when he had left.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;How was school?&rdquo; Peter walked over to a stool and sat down, dropping his bag on the floor and putting the plastic bag on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;It was good.&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;I worked on my web fluids in chemistry since everyone was working on a lab. And then my history teacher showed a movie so I got to nap in that class.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And math?&rdquo; Tony asked, walking over to where Peter was sitting. &ldquo;How did that go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Ned won,&rdquo; Peter said with a shrug. &ldquo;I know we got to thirty digits, but Ned had thirty four memorized.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry to hear that kid,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;But at least you know you got a smart guy in the chair.&rdquo; Tony smirked, earning a grin from Peter. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to beat up about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s super smart so he deserved to win,&rdquo; Peter said. Tony nodded and looked at the plastic bag.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in there?&rdquo; Peter smiled and reached into the bag, pulling out a small, plastic box. It looked like a to-go container from any restaurant or diner.</p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s Pi Day,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;And you helped me, so I brought some pie.&rdquo; He opened the box and placed it on the table. Sure enough, inside were two slices of blueberry pie. Tony smiled a little. He sat down on the stool next to Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get those last four digits next year,&rdquo; Tony said with a smile, a smile as he picked up a fork and dug into one of the slices of pie. Peter smiled before doing the same.\u00a0</p><p>It was the start of his favorite Pi Day tradition.</p>",

Tony nodded and looked at the plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d Peter smiled and reached into the bag, pulling out a small, plastic box. It looked like a to-go container from any restaurant or diner.</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s Pi Day,\u201d Peter said. \u201cAnd you helped me, so I brought some pie.\u201d He opened the box and placed it on the table. Sure enough, inside were two slices of blueberry pie. Tony smiled a little. He sat down on the stool next to Peter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get those last four digits next year,\u201d Tony said with a smile, a smile as he picked up a fork and dug into one of the slices of pie. Peter smiled before doing the same.\u00a0</p><p>It was the start of his favorite Pi Day tradition.</p>",

Also will be posted on Ao3.</b></p><hr><p>It started as a joke.\u00a0</p><p>Peter and Ned were sitting in their freshman year math class, when their teacher promised a slice of pie for the student who could recite the most digits of Pi. Peter wasn\u2019t even interested in doing it, until Flash bragged that he was going to win.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even memorize two digits, Penis!\u201d Flash yelled at him from across the table at Decathlon practice. So Peter decided to try because pie was good, but beating Flash was better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI bet one of us could win,\u201d Ned said, as they hung out in May\u2019s apartment later that evening. Peter was reading through numbers memorizing them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTwenty is probably enough right?\u201d Peter asked looking away from his computer. \u201cFlash isn\u2019t that patient.\u201d Ned chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI know twenty one already,\u201d Ned said with a shrug. \u201cBut twenty is probably enough if you want to beat Flash.\u201d Peter smirked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh so you\u2019re going to win?\u201d He asked with a chuckle. Ned shrugged and the chuckle slipped away from his lips. \u201cDude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBro, Mrs. Simmons makes a mean apple pie,\u201d Ned said with a shrug. \u201cBesides, we both know I\u2019m the less forgetful one of the two of us.\u201d Peter wanted to be offended, but also wondered if his friend was kidding.</p><p>\u201cSo list them then,\u201d He said with a smirk. \u201cIf you know twenty one digits of Pi.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201c3.141592653589793238462.\u201d Ned said with a smug smirk.<br></p><p>\u201cOh dude, it\u2019s so on.\u201d Peter said, before spinning back around to his computer. Ned chuckled, but then when Peter didn\u2019t respond, quickly pulled his phone out to begin memorizing more digits of Pi.<br></p><p>The day of the competition, Flash got barely twelve digits before quitting. Peter recited twenty two digits of Pi, a proud look on his face. Even his teacher was impressed. Until Ned went up. And recited twenty four digits. And won the slice of apple pie.</p><p>\u201cTold you dude,\u201d Ned said, sitting back down to Peter and digging into his slice of pie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh now it\u2019s really on.\u201d</p><p>Which was how, almost a year later, Peter found himself reciting digits of Pi to himself, while he worked on his suit. He worked in Tony\u2019s lab once a week, usually on a Wednesday. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t be memorizing digits, especially in front of his mentor, but between Decathlon and being Spider-Man, he hadn\u2019t much time to practice.\u00a0</p><p>To Tony, the kid looked crazy. He was mumbling to himself as he worked. He was normally the chattiest kid on the planet. He could talk Tony\u2019s ear off any day of the week. But today, it was just mumbles. And from what Tony was picking up, it sounded like numbers.</p><p>\u201cAlright kid, what gives?\u201d Peter looked up from his work, a sheepish smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cSorry Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter said, his ears burning in embarrassment. \u201cI can stop, if it\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you\u2019re even doing?\u201d Tony asked, pulling up a stool and sitting next to Peter. Peter\u2019s ears just burned even more. So now he was going to have to explain this. To Tony Stark. He was going to die of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cWell um,\u201d Peter started, balling up the sleeves of his sweatshirt around his fists. \u201cThe math teacher at my school gives a piece of pie to the person who can memorize the most digits and recite them on Pi Day.\u201d Tony raised an eyebrow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re doing this for a piece of pie?\u201d Peter shrugged, still embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s silly I know.\u201d Tony\u2019s facial expression changed and he shrugged. \u201cAnd originally it was just supposed to be fun. But Ned memorized twenty two digits last year! And the pie he got looked so good and I really, really want to win.\u201d Tony stared at the kid. Peter stared back at his mentor, wondering what the Tony Stark could possibly could be thinking about this stupid thing he was doing. <br><br>And then Tony chuckled. He shook his head and chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBetter be some good pie,\u201d Tony said. Peter\u2019s eyes widened a little in shock.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid?\u201d Peter asked, feeling a little less embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cKid the kinds of things I did to win a competition against Rhodey would make you blush,\u201d Tony said. Peter chuckled awkwardly, not really wanting to hear any of that. He\u2019d read enough about Tony Stark over the course of his life that he could only imagine the kinds of stories had. \u201cHow about I help you?\u201d A wide grin crossed Peter\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He asked, his brown eyes widened. To Tony, it looked strangely adorable. The kid acted like a puppy half the time anyways.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d So the two sat there for the rest of Peter\u2019s time there, memorizing and reciting digits of pie.</p><hr><p>Tony sat in his workshop on Pi Day. He had spent a few hours rehearsing digits with Peter, that he had been practicing them himself the rest of the evening. Pepper was amused, especially when she heard it was because of the kid. She teased him about how differently he acted around the kid, but he always just waved her off or silenced his fiancee with a kiss. And who cared if he was a bit of a softie around Peter? The kid was smart and good at being Spider-Man (when he wasn\u2019t taking on bad guys beyond his skill set).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Mr. Stark!\u201d Peter ran into the lab, his backpack on one shoulder and a plastic bag in the other hand. Tony had invited the kid to come back that day. They hadn\u2019t finished upgrading his suit and Tony kind of wanted to know if the kid won. He had been so excited about it when he had left.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cHow was school?\u201d Peter walked over to a stool and sat down, dropping his bag on the floor and putting the plastic bag on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt was good.\u201d Peter said. \u201cI worked on my web fluids in chemistry since everyone was working on a lab.

You wish you could say he looked ridiculous but in all honesty you know you\u2019d be lying. He\u2019s stupidly handsome, with or without colored hair. </p><!-- more --><p>His eyes flit across the crowded living room, across the makeshift dance floor and the furniture surrounding it. His mouth is pressed into a firm line and you swallow down a laugh at the cluelessness on his face. </p><p>And then he\u2019s staring at you and your humor vanishes in an instant. </p><p>The corners of his mouth pull upwards into a smirk, his eyebrows jumping teasingly and suddenly he doesn\u2019t look so hopeless anymore. You clench your fists and fight the urge to shoot him a vulgar gesture from across the room. </p><p>There\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll have trouble living this down, the fact that he caught you staring. Maybe you could blame it on fatigue, or say you were just admiring how ugly he is.</p><p><i>As if.</i></p><p>You cast your eyes to the ceiling, silently cursing yourself for this mistake. Someone nudges your shoulder. </p><p>Ned Leeds is grinning at you, and okay maybe you want to die a little bit. \u2018Hey,\u2019 Hey says.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 You reply, glancing at him. </p><p>\u2018I saw you, uh, staring at Peter,\u2019 he wiggles his eyebrows at you. If he weren\u2019t so sweet most of the time you might\u2019ve punched him. </p><p>\u2018He had mustard on his shirt,\u2019 You say. </p><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t like mustard,\u2019 Ned pokes your arm and you fold your own over each other. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s all the more alarming then,\u2019 You rock on your heels. \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you be with him anyways?\u2019 Honest curiosity seeps through your voice. It\u2019s strange to see them separated, the two are practically glued at the hip. Then again, it\u2019s strange that someone as kind as Ned would even deign to friends with someone like Peter in the first place</p><p>\u2018We decided to divide and conquer,\u2019 He jokes. \u2018Here he comes anyways. Hey, Pete.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey man,\u2019 Peter appears on the opposite side of his friend, patting the boy twice on the back before letting his eyes roam to you. \u2018Y/N.\u2019</p><p>You hum, keeping your gaze trained ahead of you. He snorts.</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m out,\u2019 Ned says, already backing away from the pair of you and throwing up a peace sign for good measure. Peter slides next to you in his place.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 He says. You tense your jaw. \u2018Saw you staring.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018No you didn\u2019t,\u2019 You say, still keeping your eyes away from the boy.</p><p>\u2018Yes I did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>No</i>, you didn\u2019t,\u2019 You shake your head. \u2018I was looking over you, you\u2019re short.\u2019 </p><p>He makes a choked noise, crossed between a laugh and a sigh. \u2018Way harsh.\u2019 \u00a0You simply shrug a shoulder. \u2018I\u2019d rather be short than unpleasant all-around.\u2019 You whip your head around to glare at him only to be met with a teasing grin. \u2018Gotcha.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re insufferable,\u2019 You snap.</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019ve been told,\u2019 He takes a swig out of a plastic cup you didn\u2019t notice he was holding. Your eyes flit to it for a split second. \u2018You want some? It\u2019s punch.\u2019</p><p>You laugh, throwing your head back. \u2018Drink from the same cup as you? I\u2019d rather drown.\u2019</p><p>Peter waves his hand through the air like he\u2019s been burned, but the smile stays plastered on his lips. \u2018You are just a ball of sunshine tonight aren\u2019t you?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Oh, you have no idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think I might,\u2019 he takes another long sip before leaning across you and setting it down on the soil of a potted plant. You reel backwards, the heat of his skin so close to yours taking you by surprise. \u2018Relax.\u2019 </p><p>You glance at him out of the corner of your eye. His hands are shoved in his pockets now, shoulders raised to his chin and under the flashing lights his usually crooked nose looks almost straight. He scrunches it up, as if sensing your thoughts.</p><p>\u2018Why\u2019re you here anyways?\u2019 He wonders, you tilt your head and eye him carefully. \u2018You don\u2019t like parties. Or even going outside if we\u2019re being honest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And how would you know?\u2019 You say.</p><p>\u2018Y/N, I\u2019ve known you since freshman year,\u2019 He cards his hands through the phantom colors in his hair. \u2018Plus, it\u2019s not exactly a secret.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t like them either,\u2019 You snap, stumbling as someone pushes you out of their way. You smell alcohol on their breath so you don\u2019t take it personal, but you could\u2019ve done without falling against Peter\u2019s shoulder. He grabs your arm to keep you at a semblance of distance. You pull away too quick to be casual. </p><p>\u2018I like watching people make bad decisions.\u2019 He says, acting as if nothing had changed. You can\u2019t help but feel thankful.</p><p>\u2018Make you feel a little less shitty about yours?\u2019 You inquire, a smirk pulling at your lips. To your chagrin he simply shrugs. </p><p>\u2018I like watching you be a party pooper too,\u2019 He adds to the movement. </p><p>You almost mock him at the childish phrase before the insults hits you. \u2018I am not!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are so,\u2019 He chuckles. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen you do anything but mope around for an hour.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019ve been watching me then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Once again,\u2019 He brandishes his hands. \u2018I like watching you be a deadbeat.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hate you,\u2019 You say, harsher than you intend it but the insult only seems to add fuel to his own.</p><p>\u2018I bet you wouldn\u2019t go out there and dance if your life depended on it,\u2019 \u00a0He shakes his head. \u2018If everyone\u2019s life depended on it. Man, we\u2019d be fucked.\u2019</p><p>Your eyes glint dangerously in the dim light. \u2018Is that a challenge, Parker?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you want it to be, Y/L/N?\u2019 You narrow your eyes and he wrinkles his nose. \u2018You\u2019re way too much of a prude to take me up on it anyways.\u2019</p><p>You scoff, letting your cardigan slip from your shoulders before flinging the garment at the boy, leaving you in a solid colored tank top. Peter presses his lips together in an attempt to hide is smirk but his eyes give him away, it only adds fuel to the flame of your anger. </p><p>How dare he assume <i>anything</i> about you, he doesn\u2019t know you!</p><p>You turn on your heel, marching into the crowd of sweaty teens just as a new song begins to filter through the house. Cheers sound around you at the change of music.</p><p>Someone taps you on the shoulder and whip around to find one of your friends, dazed- eyed and grinning like a maniac. You smile back as she takes your hands to pull you deeper into the room. </p><p>You spend the next two songs trying to keep up with your experienced friends, moving your body to the beat of the drums and trying not to wince at your own clumsiness when you smack more than one arm or shoulder. Someone hands you a glass filled with clear liquid and against your better judgment you tilt your head back and pour the drink down your throat. </p><p>It stings on the way down, tasting of chemicals and nail polish remover. Someone nudges your shoulder with a laugh and shoves something new in your hand. A sticky can filled with barely three sips of an energy drink. </p><p>\u2018Wash it down with this,\u2019 They say, and you do- the bitter taste washing away and being replaced by a much sweeter one. </p><p>Eventually- finally- you give up on dancing, deciding your point to be proven and stumble off of the dance floor. \u00a0Sweat clings to your neck and you gather your hair in a hand, suspending it above your skin for an attempt at cooling off. </p><p>Peter stands in the same spot as before, face flushed and mouth slightly ajar. You march towards him, like soldier on your way to battle, and rip your cardigan from his hands. </p><p>He stares at you for a second more before his gape stretches into a grin, and suddenly he\u2019s doubled over and laughing like the joker on steroids. You breathe out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u2018Oh my <i>god</i>,\u2019 He yells, straightening his back as more giggles tumble from his lips. \u2018What was that?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018That was me proving you wrong,\u2019 You shrug the piece of cloth back over your shoulders and brace your hands on your hips. Peter licks his lips and furrows his brows.</p><p><i>Damn him</i>.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u2018I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I had in mind.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You get what you get, asshole.\u2019 </p><p>His foot taps against the wooden floor to the beat of an unknown song and suddenly you feel dizzy, a little embarrassed and ready to get the hell out of there. You take a step back, noting how Peter\u2019s eyes immediately flit to your face, and begin to walk away when he grabs your wrist and pulls at you. Your skin doesn\u2019t crawl at his touch and his skin is soft and warm against yours, but maybe it\u2019s just the alcohol.</p><p>\u2018Hang on,\u2019 He says. You cock your head and arch your brows. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Away,\u2019 You deadpan. \u2018I don\u2019t know. Why do you care?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve had alcohol.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So has everyone else,\u2019 You say. You can still feel the sting of the drink in your throat, the heat of it warming your chest. </p><p>\u2018Not me,\u2019 He states.</p><p>\u2018Wow, happy for you,\u2019 \u00a0You glance over your shoulder, pulling at your arm softly. If you\u2019re being completely honest with yourself you don\u2019t think you\u2019d really care if Peter stuck by your side for the rest of the night (although you would never say that to his face) but the crowd is becoming rowdier with each passing moment and your tongue looser. \u2018I\u2019m gonna go.\u2019 </p><p>You pull yourself free and he calls after you, even steps forwards to keep you from leaving again, but you\u2019re already weaving your way towards the kitchen. Maybe if you find some cold water you can wash away the remnants of alcohol from your tongue.</p><p>The kitchen is less crowded than the living room. A few people mull around, red plastic cups gripped in their hands with a dark liquids sloshing over the brim and eating tiny snacks from giant bowls. Someone is knocked out on the tiled floor, a line of drool trailing down his cheek and you try not to nudge him as you pass by, edging near the end of the counter until you\u2019re in the clear. </p><p>Your fingers barely graze the edge of an empty cup before someone shoves a half full one in your palm instead. You stare longingly at your desired glass, now rolling away from the punch. </p><p>Flash Thompson grins at you, flicking a lock of hair from his eyes. \u2018Hey,\u2019 He says.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 You reply, shoving the drink back towards him. He shakes his head, a glint in his eyes. </p><p>\u2018Drink it,\u2019 He says. Your first thought is that he\u2019s drugged it, that he\u2019s planning on kidnapping you or killing you or something worse, then you remember it\u2019s <i>Flash</i> you\u2019re talking to. He\u2019s an ass but he\u2019s no criminal. </p><p>\u2018No thanks,\u2019 A frown settles on Flash\u2019s lips at the words and you avert your eyes from his. </p><p>He tangles his hands in the hem of his <i>Star Trek,</i> t-shirt- the fabric depicting a scene with a quote you can\u2019t make out- he juts out his chin. \u2018Don\u2019t be a buzzkill.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You know you\u2019re the second person to call me that,\u2019 You set the cup down on the counter and reach for the still empty one, an arms length away. The plastic is warm and dry against your fingers. \u2018And this is the second time that I do not care.\u2019 </p><p>You turn and push the handle of the faucet upwards, dipping your cup underneath the cool stream. Flash scoffs behind you. \u2018Why the hell are you here if you aren\u2019t drinking?\u2019 </p><p>You turn around, eyes flashing with anger but you push it down. As much as you dislike Parker, Flash is quickly taking his spot as your second least favorite person on the planet (the first of course occupied by the president, but hell if Flash isn\u2019t coming in close right about now)</p><p>The boy is standing too close to you when you face him fully, his chest almost pressing against yours. Your brain still feels too heavy from alcohol to push him away but your skin begins to crawl with nerves and disgust. </p><p>\u2018For your information,\u2019 You start, against your better judgment. \u2018I have had a shot and I don\u2019t intend to take another so-\u2019 You gesture vaguely with your hands before take a long swig from your cup. The water soothes your aching throat and you take another before eyeing Flash warily. \u2018I think you\u2019ve had too much, friend.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Just have some,\u2019 He pushes, grabbing the discarded cup from before and offering it once again. You shake your head firmly. Flash rolls his eyes. \u2018You\u2019re such a-\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>Hey,\u2019 </i>A hand lands on Flash\u2019s shoulder following the angry voice. You peer over the boy and feel your anger only grow. </p><p>\u2018Fuck off, Parker.\u2019 </p><p><i>Yeah fuck off, Parker</i>. You think before remembering you want Flash to fuck off a little bit more. </p><p>\u2018She said she didn\u2019t want any,\u2019 Peter says, rounding Flash and angling himself in front of you. You roll your eyes.</p><p>\u2018<i>Oh my god</i>,\u2019 You mumble. \u2018Peter-\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s none of your business,\u2019 Flash barks. \u2018She doesn\u2019t know what she wants.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Now, hang on-\u2019 You start.</p><p>Peter scoffs, crossing his arms. \u2018I think she\u2019s capable of deciding for herself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Speaking of-\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you have someone to pine over?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you have someone to piss off? Oh wait-\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>Jesus Christ,\u2019</i> You fling out your hands and both boys fall still, along with a group of bystanders watching the argument unfold. You pinch the bridge of your nose. \u2018Do you <i>hear </i>yourselves right now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N,\u2019 Peter says. </p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 You lift a finger and the words die on his tongue. You point at Flash. \u2018You just need to <i>fuck off </i>and take no for an answer, asshat.\u2019 </p><p>Flash balks, stumbling back at the assertion in your voice before finally fleeing the scene. Peter smirks, arms still crossed. You whirl on him, fury coating your features. The amusement on his face brittles and fades. </p><p>\u2018You are<i> insufferable</i>,\u2019 You yell. </p><p>He furrows his brows. \u2018I was just-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you seriously think I can\u2019t handle<i> Flash</i> by myself? Get your head out of your ass, Peter!\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Y/N-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just leave me alone,\u2019 You scoff, letting your eyes rest on his face. Surprise flickers on his features before it\u2019s joined by his own anger.</p><p>Peter shakes his head, glancing around before he grabs your wrist and drags you from the kitchen. Groans sound from behind you, at the lack of entertainment no doubt, but you pay them no mind and instead try not to stumble as Peter weaves you through the crowded house. </p><p>He shoves open the door of a bathroom. It\u2019s empty, thank god, and he pushes you inside before shutting the door with a click.</p><p>\u2018I was trying to <i>help-\u2019</i></p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care!\u2019 You laugh but the sound is void of humor. You find yourself wishing you still had your water, but you\u2019d set it down when Peter arrived and it the heat of the moment with your still-muddled brain the thought to simply turn around and turn on the faucet didn\u2019t cross your mind. \u2018You\u2019re not my <i>boyfriend</i>.\u2019</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t speak for a moment, and if you were a little more sober you might be able to make out the expressions on his face but they\u2019re all meaningless and just as confusing. \u2018I know,\u2019 He says, a bit softer. \u2018I just wanted to help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need your help,\u2019 You sound exasperated, but you can barely remember feeling that way. \u2018So fuck off.\u2019 </p><p>You try to push past him, your heart racing in your chest but Peter grabs your arm before you get far. Your head whips upwards, gaze raking over his face.</p><p>His brows are still furrowed, eyes glinting with something dangerous and strange and his chest is heaving harder than it should. You barely notice your own doing the same. It occurs to you then that he really is beautiful under the dim bathroom lights, and if he wasn\u2019t so much of an asshole with an insufferable superhero-complex you might want to kiss him. </p><p>You might wanna do it anyways. </p><p>His hand tightens against your skin and before you can comprehend it you\u2019re thinking screw it and pulling his body towards yours. He stumbles almost falling on top of you but managing to catch himself on the sink instead. A smirk pulls on his lips and you curse your clumsiness before his lips meet yours. </p><p>The kiss is sloppy and to the beat of an overplayed song on creaky speakers but it\u2019s good. Peter\u2019s lips are soft and warm and his hands are slipping against the bare skin of your hips in a way that makes you feel safe but excited at the same time. You card your fingers through his hair, pressing closer before he lifts you up by the backs of your thighs and plants you on the sink. A squeak leaves your lips and a laugh gurgles from his before you wrap your legs around his waist and you\u2019re kissing again. </p><p>His hands run up and down your sides, setting your skin on fire and <i>god</i> why did you wait this long to-</p><p>Someone bangs on the bathroom door and you break away, panting and flushed. \u2018Hurry it up in there!\u2019 A girl yells. </p><p>You press a hand to your lips. \u2018Sorry!\u2019 Peter yells, his voice cracking among syllables. You can\u2019t help the laugh that rings free. He looks up at you with a playful glare. </p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 The girl says quietly from outside at the sound of your voice. \u2018<i>Gross</i>.\u2019 </p><p>Now it\u2019s Peter\u2019s turn to laugh. He throws his head back, eyes sparkling with humor as the sound of footsteps resides. </p><p>His hair is mussed and his cheeks are stained a brighter red than you thought possible but he\u2019s smiling. And you\u2019re smiling. And okay maybe you don\u2019t hate him anymore. </p><p>His eyes focus on yours and his tongue pokes out through his teeth. \u2018So how long have you been holding that kiss back?\u2019 </p><p>You scoff, shoving his face away. He laughs again and you think maybe you stopped hating him a long time ago. </p><p>~</p><p><b>taglist:\u00a0</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\">@minnie-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\">@lokis-sunflower-anna</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKuQ-_5GfUqjZej8sgK1wSQ\">@magic-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moE_3Ph0oXCxZzl1_Y1Ct1g\">@quxntumvandyne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF71GKE4B7LLNc_tAZ_N6MA\">@e-ms-world</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU7AxU4LDHKQ63LVRL9RITA\">@highlady-ofthe-summercourt</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKwwd_5Dai95XE8150lF9xQ\">@secondsineternity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhdoiYECfwG9DcHLUSVbEBA\">@sadicallyrad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\">@hedwigthelegend</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbIwCgwZCsLKX-9g8RncILA\">@signed-potato</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maWg3Y2rRoN4fJwBIHsAHpQ\">@awkwardnesshabitat</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXDwScBzojYIj4wWL9bs-lQ\">@spideyboipete</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbIIN1EFUDHC-CU2k_g3sw\">@thelivvylovegood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ3r0EnrsVP4wrUmbjmBPEw\">@anxieteandbiscuits</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj1ozk4sSvmnpQXSzmixTlw\">@astral-parker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlwy1zQGX8v0frk4LDIIm9g\">@suncitydanvers</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHzeUidPwl8Iq_VMWOIC4QA\">@ukulele-tea-and-ocean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md9tojikcn6bZ_qvwTFEsoQ\">@lovely-parker</a></p>",

You wish you could say he looked ridiculous but in all honesty you know you\u2019d be lying. He\u2019s stupidly handsome, with or without colored hair. </p>[[MORE]]<p>His eyes flit across the crowded living room, across the makeshift dance floor and the furniture surrounding it. His mouth is pressed into a firm line and you swallow down a laugh at the cluelessness on his face. </p><p>And then he\u2019s staring at you and your humor vanishes in an instant. </p><p>The corners of his mouth pull upwards into a smirk, his eyebrows jumping teasingly and suddenly he doesn\u2019t look so hopeless anymore. You clench your fists and fight the urge to shoot him a vulgar gesture from across the room. </p><p>There\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll have trouble living this down, the fact that he caught you staring. Maybe you could blame it on fatigue, or say you were just admiring how ugly he is.</p><p><i>As if.</i></p><p>You cast your eyes to the ceiling, silently cursing yourself for this mistake. Someone nudges your shoulder. </p><p>Ned Leeds is grinning at you, and okay maybe you want to die a little bit. \u2018Hey,\u2019 Hey says.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 You reply, glancing at him. </p><p>\u2018I saw you, uh, staring at Peter,\u2019 he wiggles his eyebrows at you. If he weren\u2019t so sweet most of the time you might\u2019ve punched him. </p><p>\u2018He had mustard on his shirt,\u2019 You say. </p><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t like mustard,\u2019 Ned pokes your arm and you fold your own over each other. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s all the more alarming then,\u2019 You rock on your heels. \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you be with him anyways?\u2019 Honest curiosity seeps through your voice. It\u2019s strange to see them separated, the two are practically glued at the hip. Then again, it\u2019s strange that someone as kind as Ned would even deign to friends with someone like Peter in the first place</p><p>\u2018We decided to divide and conquer,\u2019 He jokes. \u2018Here he comes anyways. Hey, Pete.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey man,\u2019 Peter appears on the opposite side of his friend, patting the boy twice on the back before letting his eyes roam to you. \u2018Y/N.\u2019</p><p>You hum, keeping your gaze trained ahead of you. He snorts.</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m out,\u2019 Ned says, already backing away from the pair of you and throwing up a peace sign for good measure. Peter slides next to you in his place.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 He says. You tense your jaw. \u2018Saw you staring.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018No you didn\u2019t,\u2019 You say, still keeping your eyes away from the boy.</p><p>\u2018Yes I did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>No</i>, you didn\u2019t,\u2019 You shake your head. \u2018I was looking over you, you\u2019re short.\u2019 </p><p>He makes a choked noise, crossed between a laugh and a sigh. \u2018Way harsh.\u2019 \u00a0You simply shrug a shoulder. \u2018I\u2019d rather be short than unpleasant all-around.\u2019 You whip your head around to glare at him only to be met with a teasing grin. \u2018Gotcha.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re insufferable,\u2019 You snap.</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019ve been told,\u2019 He takes a swig out of a plastic cup you didn\u2019t notice he was holding. Your eyes flit to it for a split second. \u2018You want some? It\u2019s punch.\u2019</p><p>You laugh, throwing your head back. \u2018Drink from the same cup as you? I\u2019d rather drown.\u2019</p><p>Peter waves his hand through the air like he\u2019s been burned, but the smile stays plastered on his lips. \u2018You are just a ball of sunshine tonight aren\u2019t you?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Oh, you have no idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think I might,\u2019 he takes another long sip before leaning across you and setting it down on the soil of a potted plant. You reel backwards, the heat of his skin so close to yours taking you by surprise. \u2018Relax.\u2019 </p><p>You glance at him out of the corner of your eye. His hands are shoved in his pockets now, shoulders raised to his chin and under the flashing lights his usually crooked nose looks almost straight. He scrunches it up, as if sensing your thoughts.</p><p>\u2018Why\u2019re you here anyways?\u2019 He wonders, you tilt your head and eye him carefully. \u2018You don\u2019t like parties. Or even going outside if we\u2019re being honest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And how would you know?\u2019 You say.</p><p>\u2018Y/N, I\u2019ve known you since freshman year,\u2019 He cards his hands through the phantom colors in his hair. \u2018Plus, it\u2019s not exactly a secret.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t like them either,\u2019 You snap, stumbling as someone pushes you out of their way. You smell alcohol on their breath so you don\u2019t take it personal, but you could\u2019ve done without falling against Peter\u2019s shoulder. He grabs your arm to keep you at a semblance of distance. You pull away too quick to be casual. </p><p>\u2018I like watching people make bad decisions.\u2019 He says, acting as if nothing had changed. You can\u2019t help but feel thankful.</p><p>\u2018Make you feel a little less shitty about yours?\u2019 You inquire, a smirk pulling at your lips. To your chagrin he simply shrugs. </p><p>\u2018I like watching you be a party pooper too,\u2019 He adds to the movement. </p><p>You almost mock him at the childish phrase before the insults hits you. \u2018I am not!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are so,\u2019 He chuckles. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen you do anything but mope around for an hour.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019ve been watching me then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Once again,\u2019 He brandishes his hands. \u2018I like watching you be a deadbeat.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hate you,\u2019 You say, harsher than you intend it but the insult only seems to add fuel to his own.</p><p>\u2018I bet you wouldn\u2019t go out there and dance if your life depended on it,\u2019 \u00a0He shakes his head. \u2018If everyone\u2019s life depended on it. Man, we\u2019d be fucked.\u2019</p><p>Your eyes glint dangerously in the dim light. \u2018Is that a challenge, Parker?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you want it to be, Y/L/N?\u2019 You narrow your eyes and he wrinkles his nose. \u2018You\u2019re way too much of a prude to take me up on it anyways.\u2019</p><p>You scoff, letting your cardigan slip from your shoulders before flinging the garment at the boy, leaving you in a solid colored tank top. Peter presses his lips together in an attempt to hide is smirk but his eyes give him away, it only adds fuel to the flame of your anger. </p><p>How dare he assume <i>anything</i> about you, he doesn\u2019t know you!</p><p>You turn on your heel, marching into the crowd of sweaty teens just as a new song begins to filter through the house. Cheers sound around you at the change of music.</p><p>Someone taps you on the shoulder and whip around to find one of your friends, dazed- eyed and grinning like a maniac. You smile back as she takes your hands to pull you deeper into the room. </p><p>You spend the next two songs trying to keep up with your experienced friends, moving your body to the beat of the drums and trying not to wince at your own clumsiness when you smack more than one arm or shoulder. Someone hands you a glass filled with clear liquid and against your better judgment you tilt your head back and pour the drink down your throat. </p><p>It stings on the way down, tasting of chemicals and nail polish remover. Someone nudges your shoulder with a laugh and shoves something new in your hand. A sticky can filled with barely three sips of an energy drink. </p><p>\u2018Wash it down with this,\u2019 They say, and you do- the bitter taste washing away and being replaced by a much sweeter one. </p><p>Eventually- finally- you give up on dancing, deciding your point to be proven and stumble off of the dance floor. \u00a0Sweat clings to your neck and you gather your hair in a hand, suspending it above your skin for an attempt at cooling off. </p><p>Peter stands in the same spot as before, face flushed and mouth slightly ajar. You march towards him, like soldier on your way to battle, and rip your cardigan from his hands. </p><p>He stares at you for a second more before his gape stretches into a grin, and suddenly he\u2019s doubled over and laughing like the joker on steroids. You breathe out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u2018Oh my <i>god</i>,\u2019 He yells, straightening his back as more giggles tumble from his lips. \u2018What was that?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018That was me proving you wrong,\u2019 You shrug the piece of cloth back over your shoulders and brace your hands on your hips. Peter licks his lips and furrows his brows.</p><p><i>Damn him</i>.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u2018I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I had in mind.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You get what you get, asshole.\u2019 </p><p>His foot taps against the wooden floor to the beat of an unknown song and suddenly you feel dizzy, a little embarrassed and ready to get the hell out of there. You take a step back, noting how Peter\u2019s eyes immediately flit to your face, and begin to walk away when he grabs your wrist and pulls at you. Your skin doesn\u2019t crawl at his touch and his skin is soft and warm against yours, but maybe it\u2019s just the alcohol.</p><p>\u2018Hang on,\u2019 He says. You cock your head and arch your brows. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Away,\u2019 You deadpan. \u2018I don\u2019t know. Why do you care?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve had alcohol.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So has everyone else,\u2019 You say. You can still feel the sting of the drink in your throat, the heat of it warming your chest. </p><p>\u2018Not me,\u2019 He states.</p><p>\u2018Wow, happy for you,\u2019 \u00a0You glance over your shoulder, pulling at your arm softly. If you\u2019re being completely honest with yourself you don\u2019t think you\u2019d really care if Peter stuck by your side for the rest of the night (although you would never say that to his face) but the crowd is becoming rowdier with each passing moment and your tongue looser. \u2018I\u2019m gonna go.\u2019 </p><p>You pull yourself free and he calls after you, even steps forwards to keep you from leaving again, but you\u2019re already weaving your way towards the kitchen. Maybe if you find some cold water you can wash away the remnants of alcohol from your tongue.</p><p>The kitchen is less crowded than the living room. A few people mull around, red plastic cups gripped in their hands with a dark liquids sloshing over the brim and eating tiny snacks from giant bowls. Someone is knocked out on the tiled floor, a line of drool trailing down his cheek and you try not to nudge him as you pass by, edging near the end of the counter until you\u2019re in the clear. </p><p>Your fingers barely graze the edge of an empty cup before someone shoves a half full one in your palm instead. You stare longingly at your desired glass, now rolling away from the punch. </p><p>Flash Thompson grins at you, flicking a lock of hair from his eyes. \u2018Hey,\u2019 He says.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 You reply, shoving the drink back towards him. He shakes his head, a glint in his eyes. </p><p>\u2018Drink it,\u2019 He says. Your first thought is that he\u2019s drugged it, that he\u2019s planning on kidnapping you or killing you or something worse, then you remember it\u2019s <i>Flash</i> you\u2019re talking to. He\u2019s an ass but he\u2019s no criminal. </p><p>\u2018No thanks,\u2019 A frown settles on Flash\u2019s lips at the words and you avert your eyes from his. </p><p>He tangles his hands in the hem of his <i>Star Trek,</i> t-shirt- the fabric depicting a scene with a quote you can\u2019t make out- he juts out his chin. \u2018Don\u2019t be a buzzkill.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You know you\u2019re the second person to call me that,\u2019 You set the cup down on the counter and reach for the still empty one, an arms length away. The plastic is warm and dry against your fingers. \u2018And this is the second time that I do not care.\u2019 </p><p>You turn and push the handle of the faucet upwards, dipping your cup underneath the cool stream. Flash scoffs behind you. \u2018Why the hell are you here if you aren\u2019t drinking?\u2019 </p><p>You turn around, eyes flashing with anger but you push it down. As much as you dislike Parker, Flash is quickly taking his spot as your second least favorite person on the planet (the first of course occupied by the president, but hell if Flash isn\u2019t coming in close right about now)</p><p>The boy is standing too close to you when you face him fully, his chest almost pressing against yours. Your brain still feels too heavy from alcohol to push him away but your skin begins to crawl with nerves and disgust. </p><p>\u2018For your information,\u2019 You start, against your better judgment. \u2018I have had a shot and I don\u2019t intend to take another so-\u2019 You gesture vaguely with your hands before take a long swig from your cup. The water soothes your aching throat and you take another before eyeing Flash warily. \u2018I think you\u2019ve had too much, friend.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Just have some,\u2019 He pushes, grabbing the discarded cup from before and offering it once again. You shake your head firmly. Flash rolls his eyes. \u2018You\u2019re such a-\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>Hey,\u2019 </i>A hand lands on Flash\u2019s shoulder following the angry voice. You peer over the boy and feel your anger only grow. </p><p>\u2018Fuck off, Parker.\u2019 </p><p><i>Yeah fuck off, Parker</i>. You think before remembering you want Flash to fuck off a little bit more. </p><p>\u2018She said she didn\u2019t want any,\u2019 Peter says, rounding Flash and angling himself in front of you. You roll your eyes.</p><p>\u2018<i>Oh my god</i>,\u2019 You mumble. \u2018Peter-\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s none of your business,\u2019 Flash barks. \u2018She doesn\u2019t know what she wants.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Now, hang on-\u2019 You start.</p><p>Peter scoffs, crossing his arms. \u2018I think she\u2019s capable of deciding for herself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Speaking of-\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you have someone to pine over?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you have someone to piss off? Oh wait-\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>Jesus Christ,\u2019</i> You fling out your hands and both boys fall still, along with a group of bystanders watching the argument unfold. You pinch the bridge of your nose. \u2018Do you <i>hear </i>yourselves right now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N,\u2019 Peter says. </p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 You lift a finger and the words die on his tongue. You point at Flash. \u2018You just need to <i>fuck off </i>and take no for an answer, asshat.\u2019 </p><p>Flash balks, stumbling back at the assertion in your voice before finally fleeing the scene. Peter smirks, arms still crossed. You whirl on him, fury coating your features. The amusement on his face brittles and fades. </p><p>\u2018You are<i> insufferable</i>,\u2019 You yell. </p><p>He furrows his brows. \u2018I was just-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you seriously think I can\u2019t handle<i> Flash</i> by myself? Get your head out of your ass, Peter!\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Y/N-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just leave me alone,\u2019 You scoff, letting your eyes rest on his face. Surprise flickers on his features before it\u2019s joined by his own anger.</p><p>Peter shakes his head, glancing around before he grabs your wrist and drags you from the kitchen. Groans sound from behind you, at the lack of entertainment no doubt, but you pay them no mind and instead try not to stumble as Peter weaves you through the crowded house. </p><p>He shoves open the door of a bathroom. It\u2019s empty, thank god, and he pushes you inside before shutting the door with a click.</p><p>\u2018I was trying to <i>help-\u2019</i></p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care!\u2019 You laugh but the sound is void of humor. You find yourself wishing you still had your water, but you\u2019d set it down when Peter arrived and it the heat of the moment with your still-muddled brain the thought to simply turn around and turn on the faucet didn\u2019t cross your mind. \u2018You\u2019re not my <i>boyfriend</i>.\u2019</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t speak for a moment, and if you were a little more sober you might be able to make out the expressions on his face but they\u2019re all meaningless and just as confusing. \u2018I know,\u2019 He says, a bit softer. \u2018I just wanted to help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need your help,\u2019 You sound exasperated, but you can barely remember feeling that way. \u2018So fuck off.\u2019 </p><p>You try to push past him, your heart racing in your chest but Peter grabs your arm before you get far. Your head whips upwards, gaze raking over his face.</p><p>His brows are still furrowed, eyes glinting with something dangerous and strange and his chest is heaving harder than it should. You barely notice your own doing the same. It occurs to you then that he really is beautiful under the dim bathroom lights, and if he wasn\u2019t so much of an asshole with an insufferable superhero-complex you might want to kiss him. </p><p>You might wanna do it anyways. </p><p>His hand tightens against your skin and before you can comprehend it you\u2019re thinking screw it and pulling his body towards yours. He stumbles almost falling on top of you but managing to catch himself on the sink instead. A smirk pulls on his lips and you curse your clumsiness before his lips meet yours. </p><p>The kiss is sloppy and to the beat of an overplayed song on creaky speakers but it\u2019s good. Peter\u2019s lips are soft and warm and his hands are slipping against the bare skin of your hips in a way that makes you feel safe but excited at the same time. You card your fingers through his hair, pressing closer before he lifts you up by the backs of your thighs and plants you on the sink. A squeak leaves your lips and a laugh gurgles from his before you wrap your legs around his waist and you\u2019re kissing again. </p><p>His hands run up and down your sides, setting your skin on fire and <i>god</i> why did you wait this long to-</p><p>Someone bangs on the bathroom door and you break away, panting and flushed. \u2018Hurry it up in there!\u2019 A girl yells. </p><p>You press a hand to your lips. \u2018Sorry!\u2019 Peter yells, his voice cracking among syllables. You can\u2019t help the laugh that rings free. He looks up at you with a playful glare. </p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 The girl says quietly from outside at the sound of your voice. \u2018<i>Gross</i>.\u2019 </p><p>Now it\u2019s Peter\u2019s turn to laugh. He throws his head back, eyes sparkling with humor as the sound of footsteps resides. </p><p>His hair is mussed and his cheeks are stained a brighter red than you thought possible but he\u2019s smiling. And you\u2019re smiling. And okay maybe you don\u2019t hate him anymore. </p><p>His eyes focus on yours and his tongue pokes out through his teeth. \u2018So how long have you been holding that kiss back?\u2019 </p><p>You scoff, shoving his face away. He laughs again and you think maybe you stopped hating him a long time ago. </p><p>~</p><p><b>taglist:\u00a0</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\">@minnie-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\">@lokis-sunflower-anna</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKuQ-_5GfUqjZej8sgK1wSQ\">@magic-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moE_3Ph0oXCxZzl1_Y1Ct1g\">@quxntumvandyne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF71GKE4B7LLNc_tAZ_N6MA\">@e-ms-world</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU7AxU4LDHKQ63LVRL9RITA\">@highlady-ofthe-summercourt</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKwwd_5Dai95XE8150lF9xQ\">@secondsineternity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhdoiYECfwG9DcHLUSVbEBA\">@sadicallyrad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\">@hedwigthelegend</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbIwCgwZCsLKX-9g8RncILA\">@signed-potato</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maWg3Y2rRoN4fJwBIHsAHpQ\">@awkwardnesshabitat</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXDwScBzojYIj4wWL9bs-lQ\">@spideyboipete</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbIIN1EFUDHC-CU2k_g3sw\">@thelivvylovegood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ3r0EnrsVP4wrUmbjmBPEw\">@anxieteandbiscuits</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj1ozk4sSvmnpQXSzmixTlw\">@astral-parker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlwy1zQGX8v0frk4LDIIm9g\">@suncitydanvers</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHzeUidPwl8Iq_VMWOIC4QA\">@ukulele-tea-and-ocean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md9tojikcn6bZ_qvwTFEsoQ\">@lovely-parker</a></p>",

You wish you could say he looked ridiculous but in all honesty you know you\u2019d be lying. He\u2019s stupidly handsome, with or without colored hair. </p>[[MORE]]<p>His eyes flit across the crowded living room, across the makeshift dance floor and the furniture surrounding it. His mouth is pressed into a firm line and you swallow down a laugh at the cluelessness on his face. </p><p>And then he\u2019s staring at you and your humor vanishes in an instant. </p><p>The corners of his mouth pull upwards into a smirk, his eyebrows jumping teasingly and suddenly he doesn\u2019t look so hopeless anymore. You clench your fists and fight the urge to shoot him a vulgar gesture from across the room. </p><p>There\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll have trouble living this down, the fact that he caught you staring. Maybe you could blame it on fatigue, or say you were just admiring how ugly he is.</p><p><i>As if.</i></p><p>You cast your eyes to the ceiling, silently cursing yourself for this mistake. Someone nudges your shoulder. </p><p>Ned Leeds is grinning at you, and okay maybe you want to die a little bit. \u2018Hey,\u2019 Hey says.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 You reply, glancing at him. </p><p>\u2018I saw you, uh, staring at Peter,\u2019 he wiggles his eyebrows at you. If he weren\u2019t so sweet most of the time you might\u2019ve punched him. </p><p>\u2018He had mustard on his shirt,\u2019 You say. </p><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t like mustard,\u2019 Ned pokes your arm and you fold your own over each other. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s all the more alarming then,\u2019 You rock on your heels. \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you be with him anyways?\u2019 Honest curiosity seeps through your voice. It\u2019s strange to see them separated, the two are practically glued at the hip. Then again, it\u2019s strange that someone as kind as Ned would even deign to friends with someone like Peter in the first place</p><p>\u2018We decided to divide and conquer,\u2019 He jokes. \u2018Here he comes anyways. Hey, Pete.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey man,\u2019 Peter appears on the opposite side of his friend, patting the boy twice on the back before letting his eyes roam to you. \u2018Y/N.\u2019</p><p>You hum, keeping your gaze trained ahead of you. He snorts.</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m out,\u2019 Ned says, already backing away from the pair of you and throwing up a peace sign for good measure. Peter slides next to you in his place.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 He says. You tense your jaw. \u2018Saw you staring.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018No you didn\u2019t,\u2019 You say, still keeping your eyes away from the boy.</p><p>\u2018Yes I did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>No</i>, you didn\u2019t,\u2019 You shake your head. \u2018I was looking over you, you\u2019re short.\u2019 </p><p>He makes a choked noise, crossed between a laugh and a sigh. \u2018Way harsh.\u2019 \u00a0You simply shrug a shoulder. \u2018I\u2019d rather be short than unpleasant all-around.\u2019 You whip your head around to glare at him only to be met with a teasing grin. \u2018Gotcha.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re insufferable,\u2019 You snap.</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019ve been told,\u2019 He takes a swig out of a plastic cup you didn\u2019t notice he was holding. Your eyes flit to it for a split second. \u2018You want some? It\u2019s punch.\u2019</p><p>You laugh, throwing your head back. \u2018Drink from the same cup as you? I\u2019d rather drown.\u2019</p><p>Peter waves his hand through the air like he\u2019s been burned, but the smile stays plastered on his lips. \u2018You are just a ball of sunshine tonight aren\u2019t you?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Oh, you have no idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think I might,\u2019 he takes another long sip before leaning across you and setting it down on the soil of a potted plant. You reel backwards, the heat of his skin so close to yours taking you by surprise. \u2018Relax.\u2019 </p><p>You glance at him out of the corner of your eye. His hands are shoved in his pockets now, shoulders raised to his chin and under the flashing lights his usually crooked nose looks almost straight. He scrunches it up, as if sensing your thoughts.</p><p>\u2018Why\u2019re you here anyways?\u2019 He wonders, you tilt your head and eye him carefully. \u2018You don\u2019t like parties. Or even going outside if we\u2019re being honest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And how would you know?\u2019 You say.</p><p>\u2018Y/N, I\u2019ve known you since freshman year,\u2019 He cards his hands through the phantom colors in his hair. \u2018Plus, it\u2019s not exactly a secret.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t like them either,\u2019 You snap, stumbling as someone pushes you out of their way. You smell alcohol on their breath so you don\u2019t take it personal, but you could\u2019ve done without falling against Peter\u2019s shoulder. He grabs your arm to keep you at a semblance of distance. You pull away too quick to be casual. </p><p>\u2018I like watching people make bad decisions.\u2019 He says, acting as if nothing had changed. You can\u2019t help but feel thankful.</p><p>\u2018Make you feel a little less shitty about yours?\u2019 You inquire, a smirk pulling at your lips. To your chagrin he simply shrugs. </p><p>\u2018I like watching you be a party pooper too,\u2019 He adds to the movement. </p><p>You almost mock him at the childish phrase before the insults hits you. \u2018I am not!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are so,\u2019 He chuckles. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen you do anything but mope around for an hour.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019ve been watching me then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Once again,\u2019 He brandishes his hands. \u2018I like watching you be a deadbeat.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hate you,\u2019 You say, harsher than you intend it but the insult only seems to add fuel to his own.</p><p>\u2018I bet you wouldn\u2019t go out there and dance if your life depended on it,\u2019 \u00a0He shakes his head. \u2018If everyone\u2019s life depended on it. Man, we\u2019d be fucked.\u2019</p><p>Your eyes glint dangerously in the dim light. \u2018Is that a challenge, Parker?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you want it to be, Y/L/N?\u2019 You narrow your eyes and he wrinkles his nose. \u2018You\u2019re way too much of a prude to take me up on it anyways.\u2019</p><p>You scoff, letting your cardigan slip from your shoulders before flinging the garment at the boy, leaving you in a solid colored tank top. Peter presses his lips together in an attempt to hide is smirk but his eyes give him away, it only adds fuel to the flame of your anger. </p><p>How dare he assume <i>anything</i> about you, he doesn\u2019t know you!</p><p>You turn on your heel, marching into the crowd of sweaty teens just as a new song begins to filter through the house. Cheers sound around you at the change of music.</p><p>Someone taps you on the shoulder and whip around to find one of your friends, dazed- eyed and grinning like a maniac. You smile back as she takes your hands to pull you deeper into the room. </p><p>You spend the next two songs trying to keep up with your experienced friends, moving your body to the beat of the drums and trying not to wince at your own clumsiness when you smack more than one arm or shoulder. Someone hands you a glass filled with clear liquid and against your better judgment you tilt your head back and pour the drink down your throat. </p><p>It stings on the way down, tasting of chemicals and nail polish remover. Someone nudges your shoulder with a laugh and shoves something new in your hand. A sticky can filled with barely three sips of an energy drink. </p><p>\u2018Wash it down with this,\u2019 They say, and you do- the bitter taste washing away and being replaced by a much sweeter one. </p><p>Eventually- finally- you give up on dancing, deciding your point to be proven and stumble off of the dance floor. \u00a0Sweat clings to your neck and you gather your hair in a hand, suspending it above your skin for an attempt at cooling off. </p><p>Peter stands in the same spot as before, face flushed and mouth slightly ajar. You march towards him, like soldier on your way to battle, and rip your cardigan from his hands. </p><p>He stares at you for a second more before his gape stretches into a grin, and suddenly he\u2019s doubled over and laughing like the joker on steroids. You breathe out a deep sigh.</p><p>\u2018Oh my <i>god</i>,\u2019 He yells, straightening his back as more giggles tumble from his lips. \u2018What was that?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018That was me proving you wrong,\u2019 You shrug the piece of cloth back over your shoulders and brace your hands on your hips. Peter licks his lips and furrows his brows.</p><p><i>Damn him</i>.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u2018I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I had in mind.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You get what you get, asshole.\u2019 </p><p>His foot taps against the wooden floor to the beat of an unknown song and suddenly you feel dizzy, a little embarrassed and ready to get the hell out of there. You take a step back, noting how Peter\u2019s eyes immediately flit to your face, and begin to walk away when he grabs your wrist and pulls at you. Your skin doesn\u2019t crawl at his touch and his skin is soft and warm against yours, but maybe it\u2019s just the alcohol.</p><p>\u2018Hang on,\u2019 He says. You cock your head and arch your brows. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Away,\u2019 You deadpan. \u2018I don\u2019t know. Why do you care?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve had alcohol.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So has everyone else,\u2019 You say. You can still feel the sting of the drink in your throat, the heat of it warming your chest. </p><p>\u2018Not me,\u2019 He states.</p><p>\u2018Wow, happy for you,\u2019 \u00a0You glance over your shoulder, pulling at your arm softly. If you\u2019re being completely honest with yourself you don\u2019t think you\u2019d really care if Peter stuck by your side for the rest of the night (although you would never say that to his face) but the crowd is becoming rowdier with each passing moment and your tongue looser. \u2018I\u2019m gonna go.\u2019 </p><p>You pull yourself free and he calls after you, even steps forwards to keep you from leaving again, but you\u2019re already weaving your way towards the kitchen. Maybe if you find some cold water you can wash away the remnants of alcohol from your tongue.</p><p>The kitchen is less crowded than the living room. A few people mull around, red plastic cups gripped in their hands with a dark liquids sloshing over the brim and eating tiny snacks from giant bowls. Someone is knocked out on the tiled floor, a line of drool trailing down his cheek and you try not to nudge him as you pass by, edging near the end of the counter until you\u2019re in the clear. </p><p>Your fingers barely graze the edge of an empty cup before someone shoves a half full one in your palm instead. You stare longingly at your desired glass, now rolling away from the punch. </p><p>Flash Thompson grins at you, flicking a lock of hair from his eyes. \u2018Hey,\u2019 He says.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 You reply, shoving the drink back towards him. He shakes his head, a glint in his eyes. </p><p>\u2018Drink it,\u2019 He says. Your first thought is that he\u2019s drugged it, that he\u2019s planning on kidnapping you or killing you or something worse, then you remember it\u2019s <i>Flash</i> you\u2019re talking to. He\u2019s an ass but he\u2019s no criminal. </p><p>\u2018No thanks,\u2019 A frown settles on Flash\u2019s lips at the words and you avert your eyes from his. </p><p>He tangles his hands in the hem of his <i>Star Trek,</i> t-shirt- the fabric depicting a scene with a quote you can\u2019t make out- he juts out his chin. \u2018Don\u2019t be a buzzkill.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You know you\u2019re the second person to call me that,\u2019 You set the cup down on the counter and reach for the still empty one, an arms length away. The plastic is warm and dry against your fingers. \u2018And this is the second time that I do not care.\u2019 </p><p>You turn and push the handle of the faucet upwards, dipping your cup underneath the cool stream. Flash scoffs behind you. \u2018Why the hell are you here if you aren\u2019t drinking?\u2019 </p><p>You turn around, eyes flashing with anger but you push it down. As much as you dislike Parker, Flash is quickly taking his spot as your second least favorite person on the planet (the first of course occupied by the president, but hell if Flash isn\u2019t coming in close right about now)</p><p>The boy is standing too close to you when you face him fully, his chest almost pressing against yours. Your brain still feels too heavy from alcohol to push him away but your skin begins to crawl with nerves and disgust. </p><p>\u2018For your information,\u2019 You start, against your better judgment. \u2018I have had a shot and I don\u2019t intend to take another so-\u2019 You gesture vaguely with your hands before take a long swig from your cup. The water soothes your aching throat and you take another before eyeing Flash warily. \u2018I think you\u2019ve had too much, friend.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Just have some,\u2019 He pushes, grabbing the discarded cup from before and offering it once again. You shake your head firmly. Flash rolls his eyes. \u2018You\u2019re such a-\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>Hey,\u2019 </i>A hand lands on Flash\u2019s shoulder following the angry voice. You peer over the boy and feel your anger only grow. </p><p>\u2018Fuck off, Parker.\u2019 </p><p><i>Yeah fuck off, Parker</i>. You think before remembering you want Flash to fuck off a little bit more. </p><p>\u2018She said she didn\u2019t want any,\u2019 Peter says, rounding Flash and angling himself in front of you. You roll your eyes.</p><p>\u2018<i>Oh my god</i>,\u2019 You mumble. \u2018Peter-\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s none of your business,\u2019 Flash barks. \u2018She doesn\u2019t know what she wants.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Now, hang on-\u2019 You start.</p><p>Peter scoffs, crossing his arms. \u2018I think she\u2019s capable of deciding for herself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Speaking of-\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you have someone to pine over?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you have someone to piss off? Oh wait-\u2019</p><p>\u2018<i>Jesus Christ,\u2019</i> You fling out your hands and both boys fall still, along with a group of bystanders watching the argument unfold. You pinch the bridge of your nose. \u2018Do you <i>hear </i>yourselves right now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N,\u2019 Peter says. </p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 You lift a finger and the words die on his tongue. You point at Flash. \u2018You just need to <i>fuck off </i>and take no for an answer, asshat.\u2019 </p><p>Flash balks, stumbling back at the assertion in your voice before finally fleeing the scene. Peter smirks, arms still crossed. You whirl on him, fury coating your features. The amusement on his face brittles and fades. </p><p>\u2018You are<i> insufferable</i>,\u2019 You yell. </p><p>He furrows his brows. \u2018I was just-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you seriously think I can\u2019t handle<i> Flash</i> by myself?

Surprise flickers on his features before it\u2019s joined by his own anger.</p><p>Peter shakes his head, glancing around before he grabs your wrist and drags you from the kitchen. Groans sound from behind you, at the lack of entertainment no doubt, but you pay them no mind and instead try not to stumble as Peter weaves you through the crowded house. </p><p>He shoves open the door of a bathroom. It\u2019s empty, thank god, and he pushes you inside before shutting the door with a click.</p><p>\u2018I was trying to <i>help-\u2019</i></p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care!\u2019 You laugh but the sound is void of humor. You find yourself wishing you still had your water, but you\u2019d set it down when Peter arrived and it the heat of the moment with your still-muddled brain the thought to simply turn around and turn on the faucet didn\u2019t cross your mind. \u2018You\u2019re not my <i>boyfriend</i>.\u2019</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t speak for a moment, and if you were a little more sober you might be able to make out the expressions on his face but they\u2019re all meaningless and just as confusing. \u2018I know,\u2019 He says, a bit softer. \u2018I just wanted to help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need your help,\u2019 You sound exasperated, but you can barely remember feeling that way. \u2018So fuck off.\u2019 </p><p>You try to push past him, your heart racing in your chest but Peter grabs your arm before you get far. Your head whips upwards, gaze raking over his face.</p><p>His brows are still furrowed, eyes glinting with something dangerous and strange and his chest is heaving harder than it should. You barely notice your own doing the same. It occurs to you then that he really is beautiful under the dim bathroom lights, and if he wasn\u2019t so much of an asshole with an insufferable superhero-complex you might want to kiss him. </p><p>You might wanna do it anyways. </p><p>His hand tightens against your skin and before you can comprehend it you\u2019re thinking screw it and pulling his body towards yours. He stumbles almost falling on top of you but managing to catch himself on the sink instead. A smirk pulls on his lips and you curse your clumsiness before his lips meet yours. </p><p>The kiss is sloppy and to the beat of an overplayed song on creaky speakers but it\u2019s good. Peter\u2019s lips are soft and warm and his hands are slipping against the bare skin of your hips in a way that makes you feel safe but excited at the same time. You card your fingers through his hair, pressing closer before he lifts you up by the backs of your thighs and plants you on the sink. A squeak leaves your lips and a laugh gurgles from his before you wrap your legs around his waist and you\u2019re kissing again. </p><p>His hands run up and down your sides, setting your skin on fire and <i>god</i> why did you wait this long to-</p><p>Someone bangs on the bathroom door and you break away, panting and flushed. \u2018Hurry it up in there!\u2019 A girl yells. </p><p>You press a hand to your lips. \u2018Sorry!\u2019 Peter yells, his voice cracking among syllables. You can\u2019t help the laugh that rings free. He looks up at you with a playful glare. </p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 The girl says quietly from outside at the sound of your voice. \u2018<i>Gross</i>.\u2019 </p><p>Now it\u2019s Peter\u2019s turn to laugh. He throws his head back, eyes sparkling with humor as the sound of footsteps resides. </p><p>His hair is mussed and his cheeks are stained a brighter red than you thought possible but he\u2019s smiling. And you\u2019re smiling. And okay maybe you don\u2019t hate him anymore. </p><p>His eyes focus on yours and his tongue pokes out through his teeth. \u2018So how long have you been holding that kiss back?\u2019 </p><p>You scoff, shoving his face away. He laughs again and you think maybe you stopped hating him a long time ago. </p><p>~</p><p><b>taglist:\u00a0</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdr9j8nAQCXZH6kqXFVjyoQ\">@minnie-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqcsJfPKPhrFALZ5pYD6Ppg\">@celestialparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF9vAkjL9o-1ksPHeivoD4A\">@lokis-sunflower-anna</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKuQ-_5GfUqjZej8sgK1wSQ\">@magic-marvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moE_3Ph0oXCxZzl1_Y1Ct1g\">@quxntumvandyne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF71GKE4B7LLNc_tAZ_N6MA\">@e-ms-world</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU7AxU4LDHKQ63LVRL9RITA\">@highlady-ofthe-summercourt</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKwwd_5Dai95XE8150lF9xQ\">@secondsineternity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhdoiYECfwG9DcHLUSVbEBA\">@sadicallyrad</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAdVaUGhf_MUtbxQPaCKzdQ\">@laurfangirl424</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpzUOhteLtgguhE--eKKQsg\">@hedwigthelegend</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbIwCgwZCsLKX-9g8RncILA\">@signed-potato</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maHI8HGX_k063jC-w3zSADQ\">@propertyofmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maWg3Y2rRoN4fJwBIHsAHpQ\">@awkwardnesshabitat</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXDwScBzojYIj4wWL9bs-lQ\">@spideyboipete</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjbIIN1EFUDHC-CU2k_g3sw\">@thelivvylovegood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ3r0EnrsVP4wrUmbjmBPEw\">@anxieteandbiscuits</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj1ozk4sSvmnpQXSzmixTlw\">@astral-parker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyhKRgzCaF6r5n_ibCATfQ\">@laureharrier</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlwy1zQGX8v0frk4LDIIm9g\">@suncitydanvers</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHzeUidPwl8Iq_VMWOIC4QA\">@ukulele-tea-and-ocean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md9tojikcn6bZ_qvwTFEsoQ\">@lovely-parker</a></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Pairing: </b>Peter Parker x fem!Reader</p><p><b>Summary: </b>where you and Peter hate each other so you make out in the bathroom at a party</p><p><b>Warnings: </b>i mean making out and a lot of cussing and a little bit of alcohol (although i obviously have no idea how one makes out so bear with me)</p><p><b>Word count: </b>3k</p><p><b>A/N: </b>sanna uploading a fic?? more likely than you think<br /><br />(can u tell i never know what to name my fics so i just throw something out there)<br /><b>~</b></p><p>Peter Parker&rsquo;s eyes are dark under the flashing party lights, darker than usual, and his hair takes on a blue and red shine. You wish you could say he looked ridiculous but in all honesty you know you&rsquo;d be lying. He&rsquo;s stupidly handsome, with or without colored hair. </p><p>His eyes flit across the crowded living room, across the makeshift dance floor and the furniture surrounding it. His mouth is pressed into a firm line and you swallow down a laugh at the cluelessness on his face. </p><p>And then he&rsquo;s staring at you and your humor vanishes in an instant. </p><p>The corners of his mouth pull upwards into a smirk, his eyebrows jumping teasingly and suddenly he doesn&rsquo;t look so hopeless anymore. You clench your fists and fight the urge to shoot him a vulgar gesture from across the room. </p><p>There&rsquo;s no doubt you&rsquo;ll have trouble living this down, the fact that he caught you staring. Maybe you could blame it on fatigue, or say you were just admiring how ugly he is.</p><p><i>As if.</i></p><p>You cast your eyes to the ceiling, silently cursing yourself for this mistake. Someone nudges your shoulder. </p><p>Ned Leeds is grinning at you, and okay maybe you want to die a little bit. &lsquo;Hey,&rsquo; Hey says.</p><p>&lsquo;Hi,&rsquo; You reply, glancing at him. </p><p>&lsquo;I saw you, uh, staring at Peter,&rsquo; he wiggles his eyebrows at you. If he weren&rsquo;t so sweet most of the time you might&rsquo;ve punched him. </p><p>&lsquo;He had mustard on his shirt,&rsquo; You say. </p><p>&lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like mustard,&rsquo; Ned pokes your arm and you fold your own over each other. </p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the more alarming then,&rsquo; You rock on your heels. &lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be with him anyways?&rsquo; Honest curiosity seeps through your voice. It&rsquo;s strange to see them separated, the two are practically glued at the hip. Then again, it&rsquo;s strange that someone as kind as Ned would even deign to friends with someone like Peter in the first place</p><p>&lsquo;We decided to divide and conquer,&rsquo; He jokes. &lsquo;Here he comes anyways. Hey, Pete.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Hey man,&rsquo; Peter appears on the opposite side of his friend, patting the boy twice on the back before letting his eyes roam to you. &lsquo;Y/N.&rsquo;</p><p>You hum, keeping your gaze trained ahead of you. He snorts.</p><p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m out,&rsquo; Ned says, already backing away from the pair of you and throwing up a peace sign for good measure. Peter slides next to you in his place.</p><p>&lsquo;Hey,&rsquo; He says. You tense your jaw. &lsquo;Saw you staring.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;No you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; You say, still keeping your eyes away from the boy.</p><p>&lsquo;Yes I did.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;<i>No</i>, you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; You shake your head. &lsquo;I was looking over you, you&rsquo;re short.&rsquo; </p><p>He makes a choked noise, crossed between a laugh and a sigh. &lsquo;Way harsh.&rsquo; &nbsp;You simply shrug a shoulder. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather be short than unpleasant all-around.&rsquo; You whip your head around to glare at him only to be met with a teasing grin. &lsquo;Gotcha.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re insufferable,&rsquo; You snap.</p><p>&lsquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told,&rsquo; He takes a swig out of a plastic cup you didn&rsquo;t notice he was holding. Your eyes flit to it for a split second. &lsquo;You want some? It&rsquo;s punch.&rsquo;</p><p>You laugh, throwing your head back. &lsquo;Drink from the same cup as you? I&rsquo;d rather drown.&rsquo;</p><p>Peter waves his hand through the air like he&rsquo;s been burned, but the smile stays plastered on his lips. &lsquo;You are just a ball of sunshine tonight aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Oh, you have no idea.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I think I might,&rsquo; he takes another long sip before leaning across you and setting it down on the soil of a potted plant. You reel backwards, the heat of his skin so close to yours taking you by surprise. &lsquo;Relax.&rsquo; </p><p>You glance at him out of the corner of your eye. His hands are shoved in his pockets now, shoulders raised to his chin and under the flashing lights his usually crooked nose looks almost straight. He scrunches it up, as if sensing your thoughts.</p><p>&lsquo;Why&rsquo;re you here anyways?&rsquo; He wonders, you tilt your head and eye him carefully. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t like parties. Or even going outside if we&rsquo;re being honest.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;And how would you know?&rsquo; You say.</p><p>&lsquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;ve known you since freshman year,&rsquo; He cards his hands through the phantom colors in his hair. &lsquo;Plus, it&rsquo;s not exactly a secret.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t like them either,&rsquo; You snap, stumbling as someone pushes you out of their way. You smell alcohol on their breath so you don&rsquo;t take it personal, but you could&rsquo;ve done without falling against Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. He grabs your arm to keep you at a semblance of distance. You pull away too quick to be casual. </p><p>&lsquo;I like watching people make bad decisions.&rsquo; He says, acting as if nothing had changed. You can&rsquo;t help but feel thankful.</p><p>&lsquo;Make you feel a little less shitty about yours?&rsquo; You inquire, a smirk pulling at your lips. To your chagrin he simply shrugs. </p><p>&lsquo;I like watching you be a party pooper too,&rsquo; He adds to the movement. </p><p>You almost mock him at the childish phrase before the insults hits you. &lsquo;I am not!&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You are so,&rsquo; He chuckles. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you do anything but mope around for an hour.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve been watching me then?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Once again,&rsquo; He brandishes his hands. &lsquo;I like watching you be a deadbeat.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I hate you,&rsquo; You say, harsher than you intend it but the insult only seems to add fuel to his own.</p><p>&lsquo;I bet you wouldn&rsquo;t go out there and dance if your life depended on it,&rsquo; &nbsp;He shakes his head. &lsquo;If everyone&rsquo;s life depended on it. Man, we&rsquo;d be fucked.&rsquo;</p><p>Your eyes glint dangerously in the dim light. &lsquo;Is that a challenge, Parker?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Do you want it to be, Y/L/N?&rsquo; You narrow your eyes and he wrinkles his nose. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re way too much of a prude to take me up on it anyways.&rsquo;</p><p>You scoff, letting your cardigan slip from your shoulders before flinging the garment at the boy, leaving you in a solid colored tank top. Peter presses his lips together in an attempt to hide is smirk but his eyes give him away, it only adds fuel to the flame of your anger. </p><p>How dare he assume <i>anything</i> about you, he doesn&rsquo;t know you!</p><p>You turn on your heel, marching into the crowd of sweaty teens just as a new song begins to filter through the house. Cheers sound around you at the change of music.</p><p>Someone taps you on the shoulder and whip around to find one of your friends, dazed- eyed and grinning like a maniac. You smile back as she takes your hands to pull you deeper into the room. </p><p>You spend the next two songs trying to keep up with your experienced friends, moving your body to the beat of the drums and trying not to wince at your own clumsiness when you smack more than one arm or shoulder. Someone hands you a glass filled with clear liquid and against your better judgment you tilt your head back and pour the drink down your throat. </p><p>It stings on the way down, tasting of chemicals and nail polish remover. Someone nudges your shoulder with a laugh and shoves something new in your hand. A sticky can filled with barely three sips of an energy drink. </p><p>&lsquo;Wash it down with this,&rsquo; They say, and you do- the bitter taste washing away and being replaced by a much sweeter one. </p><p>Eventually- finally- you give up on dancing, deciding your point to be proven and stumble off of the dance floor. &nbsp;Sweat clings to your neck and you gather your hair in a hand, suspending it above your skin for an attempt at cooling off. </p><p>Peter stands in the same spot as before, face flushed and mouth slightly ajar. You march towards him, like soldier on your way to battle, and rip your cardigan from his hands. </p><p>He stares at you for a second more before his gape stretches into a grin, and suddenly he&rsquo;s doubled over and laughing like the joker on steroids. You breathe out a deep sigh.</p><p>&lsquo;Oh my <i>god</i>,&rsquo; He yells, straightening his back as more giggles tumble from his lips. &lsquo;What was that?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;That was me proving you wrong,&rsquo; You shrug the piece of cloth back over your shoulders and brace your hands on your hips. Peter licks his lips and furrows his brows.</p><p><i>Damn him</i>.</p><p>He shakes his head. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s what I had in mind.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;You get what you get, asshole.&rsquo; </p><p>His foot taps against the wooden floor to the beat of an unknown song and suddenly you feel dizzy, a little embarrassed and ready to get the hell out of there. You take a step back, noting how Peter&rsquo;s eyes immediately flit to your face, and begin to walk away when he grabs your wrist and pulls at you. Your skin doesn&rsquo;t crawl at his touch and his skin is soft and warm against yours, but maybe it&rsquo;s just the alcohol.</p><p>&lsquo;Hang on,&rsquo; He says. You cock your head and arch your brows. &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Away,&rsquo; You deadpan. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Why do you care?&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve had alcohol.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;So has everyone else,&rsquo; You say. You can still feel the sting of the drink in your throat, the heat of it warming your chest. </p><p>&lsquo;Not me,&rsquo; He states.</p><p>&lsquo;Wow, happy for you,&rsquo; &nbsp;You glance over your shoulder, pulling at your arm softly. If you&rsquo;re being completely honest with yourself you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d really care if Peter stuck by your side for the rest of the night (although you would never say that to his face) but the crowd is becoming rowdier with each passing moment and your tongue looser. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go.&rsquo; </p><p>You pull yourself free and he calls after you, even steps forwards to keep you from leaving again, but you&rsquo;re already weaving your way towards the kitchen. Maybe if you find some cold water you can wash away the remnants of alcohol from your tongue.</p><p>The kitchen is less crowded than the living room. A few people mull around, red plastic cups gripped in their hands with a dark liquids sloshing over the brim and eating tiny snacks from giant bowls. Someone is knocked out on the tiled floor, a line of drool trailing down his cheek and you try not to nudge him as you pass by, edging near the end of the counter until you&rsquo;re in the clear. </p><p>Your fingers barely graze the edge of an empty cup before someone shoves a half full one in your palm instead. You stare longingly at your desired glass, now rolling away from the punch. </p><p>Flash Thompson grins at you, flicking a lock of hair from his eyes. &lsquo;Hey,&rsquo; He says.</p><p>&lsquo;Hi,&rsquo; You reply, shoving the drink back towards him. He shakes his head, a glint in his eyes. </p><p>&lsquo;Drink it,&rsquo; He says. Your first thought is that he&rsquo;s drugged it, that he&rsquo;s planning on kidnapping you or killing you or something worse, then you remember it&rsquo;s <i>Flash</i> you&rsquo;re talking to. He&rsquo;s an ass but he&rsquo;s no criminal. </p><p>&lsquo;No thanks,&rsquo; A frown settles on Flash&rsquo;s lips at the words and you avert your eyes from his. </p><p>He tangles his hands in the hem of his <i>Star Trek,</i> t-shirt- the fabric depicting a scene with a quote you can&rsquo;t make out- he juts out his chin. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a buzzkill.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;You know you&rsquo;re the second person to call me that,&rsquo; You set the cup down on the counter and reach for the still empty one, an arms length away. The plastic is warm and dry against your fingers. &lsquo;And this is the second time that I do not care.&rsquo; </p><p>You turn and push the handle of the faucet upwards, dipping your cup underneath the cool stream. Flash scoffs behind you. &lsquo;Why the hell are you here if you aren&rsquo;t drinking?&rsquo; </p><p>You turn around, eyes flashing with anger but you push it down. As much as you dislike Parker, Flash is quickly taking his spot as your second least favorite person on the planet (the first of course occupied by the president, but hell if Flash isn&rsquo;t coming in close right about now)</p><p>The boy is standing too close to you when you face him fully, his chest almost pressing against yours. Your brain still feels too heavy from alcohol to push him away but your skin begins to crawl with nerves and disgust. </p><p>&lsquo;For your information,&rsquo; You start, against your better judgment. &lsquo;I have had a shot and I don&rsquo;t intend to take another so-&rsquo; You gesture vaguely with your hands before take a long swig from your cup. The water soothes your aching throat and you take another before eyeing Flash warily. &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;ve had too much, friend.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Just have some,&rsquo; He pushes, grabbing the discarded cup from before and offering it once again. You shake your head firmly. Flash rolls his eyes. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re such a-&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Hey,&rsquo; </i>A hand lands on Flash&rsquo;s shoulder following the angry voice. You peer over the boy and feel your anger only grow. </p><p>&lsquo;Fuck off, Parker.&rsquo; </p><p><i>Yeah fuck off, Parker</i>. You think before remembering you want Flash to fuck off a little bit more. </p><p>&lsquo;She said she didn&rsquo;t want any,&rsquo; Peter says, rounding Flash and angling himself in front of you. You roll your eyes.</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Oh my god</i>,&rsquo; You mumble. &lsquo;Peter-&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business,&rsquo; Flash barks. &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know what she wants.&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Now, hang on-&rsquo; You start.</p><p>Peter scoffs, crossing his arms. &lsquo;I think she&rsquo;s capable of deciding for herself.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Speaking of-&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you have someone to pine over?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you have someone to piss off? Oh wait-&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Jesus Christ,&rsquo;</i> You fling out your hands and both boys fall still, along with a group of bystanders watching the argument unfold. You pinch the bridge of your nose. &lsquo;Do you <i>hear </i>yourselves right now?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Y/N,&rsquo; Peter says. </p><p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; You lift a finger and the words die on his tongue. You point at Flash. &lsquo;You just need to <i>fuck off </i>and take no for an answer, asshat.&rsquo; </p><p>Flash balks, stumbling back at the assertion in your voice before finally fleeing the scene. Peter smirks, arms still crossed. You whirl on him, fury coating your features. The amusement on his face brittles and fades. </p><p>&lsquo;You are<i> insufferable</i>,&rsquo; You yell. </p><p>He furrows his brows. &lsquo;I was just-&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Do you seriously think I can&rsquo;t handle<i> Flash</i> by myself? Get your head out of your ass, Peter!&rsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;Y/N-&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Just leave me alone,&rsquo; You scoff, letting your eyes rest on his face. Surprise flickers on his features before it&rsquo;s joined by his own anger.</p><p>Peter shakes his head, glancing around before he grabs your wrist and drags you from the kitchen. Groans sound from behind you, at the lack of entertainment no doubt, but you pay them no mind and instead try not to stumble as Peter weaves you through the crowded house. </p><p>He shoves open the door of a bathroom. It&rsquo;s empty, thank god, and he pushes you inside before shutting the door with a click.</p><p>&lsquo;I was trying to <i>help-&rsquo;</i></p><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rsquo; You laugh but the sound is void of humor. You find yourself wishing you still had your water, but you&rsquo;d set it down when Peter arrived and it the heat of the moment with your still-muddled brain the thought to simply turn around and turn on the faucet didn&rsquo;t cross your mind. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not my <i>boyfriend</i>.&rsquo;</p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t speak for a moment, and if you were a little more sober you might be able to make out the expressions on his face but they&rsquo;re all meaningless and just as confusing. &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; He says, a bit softer. &lsquo;I just wanted to help.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t need your help,&rsquo; You sound exasperated, but you can barely remember feeling that way. &lsquo;So fuck off.&rsquo; </p><p>You try to push past him, your heart racing in your chest but Peter grabs your arm before you get far. Your head whips upwards, gaze raking over his face.</p><p>His brows are still furrowed, eyes glinting with something dangerous and strange and his chest is heaving harder than it should. You barely notice your own doing the same. It occurs to you then that he really is beautiful under the dim bathroom lights, and if he wasn&rsquo;t so much of an asshole with an insufferable superhero-complex you might want to kiss him. </p><p>You might wanna do it anyways. </p><p>His hand tightens against your skin and before you can comprehend it you&rsquo;re thinking screw it and pulling his body towards yours. He stumbles almost falling on top of you but managing to catch himself on the sink instead. A smirk pulls on his lips and you curse your clumsiness before his lips meet yours. </p><p>The kiss is sloppy and to the beat of an overplayed song on creaky speakers but it&rsquo;s good. Peter&rsquo;s lips are soft and warm and his hands are slipping against the bare skin of your hips in a way that makes you feel safe but excited at the same time. You card your fingers through his hair, pressing closer before he lifts you up by the backs of your thighs and plants you on the sink. A squeak leaves your lips and a laugh gurgles from his before you wrap your legs around his waist and you&rsquo;re kissing again. </p><p>His hands run up and down your sides, setting your skin on fire and <i>god</i> why did you wait this long to-</p><p>Someone bangs on the bathroom door and you break away, panting and flushed. &lsquo;Hurry it up in there!&rsquo; A girl yells. </p><p>You press a hand to your lips. &lsquo;Sorry!&rsquo; Peter yells, his voice cracking among syllables. You can&rsquo;t help the laugh that rings free. He looks up at you with a playful glare. </p><p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; The girl says quietly from outside at the sound of your voice. &lsquo;<i>Gross</i>.&rsquo; </p><p>Now it&rsquo;s Peter&rsquo;s turn to laugh. He throws his head back, eyes sparkling with humor as the sound of footsteps resides. </p><p>His hair is mussed and his cheeks are stained a brighter red than you thought possible but he&rsquo;s smiling.
