Ever since Harry had turned pro it was like there suddenly wasn\u2019t any time for any of their old hobbies or discussion points. No more Harry Potter movie marathons or debates about Marvel vs DC. Just tennis. And while it was great to see Harry gain some hard earned success, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time Harry asked her about her and truly listened to the answer without bouncing a ball or rewatching one of his games in the background. And this trip to Australia was just the icing on the cake. You\u2019d decided to take a stand. </i></p><p><i>\u201cActually H, about the match on Tuesday&hellip;\u201d you started, \u201cI might be a little late.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLate?\u201d Harry asked, turning to you, \u201cyou\u2019re never late.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah well I have something on and I\u2019m sure it will probably finish early or you know I can just leave but I\u2019m just letting you know that I\u2019ll be a little late is all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Oh shit. Now this is not where you wanted to go. You were hoping he would just half listen and nod and move on. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI have a date,\u201d you blurt out. </i></p><p><i>\u201cA date?\u201d Harry stopped walking. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean you have a date?\u201d Harry asked, scoffing as though it was the most ridiculous idea in the world. </i></p><p><i>\u201cExactly that!\u201d replied Y/N indignantly. \u201cWhy do you sound so surprised? Didn\u2019t think anyone would want to take me out?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat? No&hellip;I\u2019m just.. you never &hellip; I didn\u2019t know you were looking to date anyone right now,\u201d Harry stuttered. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s recent,\u201d Y/N answered vaguely, hoping to put an end to this already embarrassing conversation. Y/N and Harry didn\u2019t talk about this stuff. Ever. They could talk for hours about anything and everything but when it came to dating, they led separate lives and pretended not to care about the others. Until now. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere\u2019d you meet him?\u201d Harry asked, his full attention now completely on Y/N.</i></p><p><i>The truth is - Y/N met him on a dating app. She hasn\u2019t been out with anyone in ages and she thought what better time to try out a dating app when on the other side of the world? And Lo and behold one of her first matches was a strapping young Aussie whose abs certainly made up for his apparent affinity for beer (Y/N was not a beer drinker). You couldn\u2019t tell Harry this though as he probably wouldn\u2019t see this as important and easy to cancel&hellip; and desperate?</i></p><p><i>\u201cA caf\u00e9,\u201d you lied, \u201cI\u2019d forgotten to bring my Australian money and he offered to pay for my drink,\u201d you made up wildly. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHe seemed really nice and we got talking and now we\u2019re going on a date,\u201d you finished, fingers crossed inside your jacket pocket. </i></p><p><i>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry replied, starting to walk again. You continued in silence for another moment before Harry stopped again. </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut he could be a serial killer!\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him! How do you know what his intentions are?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry I hardly think he\u2019s a serial killer! He seemed really nice and we-\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe not a serial killer but he probably only asked you out because he wants to get into your pants!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh right I get it. You think the only possibly reason someone might ask me out is to have sex with me?\u201d You fired back. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t say-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you were saying!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was not!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWas too!\u201d</i></p><p><i>The hustle and bustle of the park carried on around you and the two childhood best friends stood face to face, cheeks flushed, in the middle of the path. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat I was trying say&hellip;\u201d Harry started, \u201cis that you\u2019re a very um&hellip; attractive woman and that might lead some jerk guy to ask you out with ..um.. not so good intentions!\u201d Harry smiled, seemingly proud of the way he was able to turn that around. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to look out for you Y/N.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can look after myself,\u201d you reply, sick of Harry\u2019s know-it-all attitude. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell I just don\u2019t see why you would want to go on a date with some random guy when you &hellip; had a prior commitment anyway.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry, I told you I\u2019m only going to be a little late!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe you shouldn\u2019t even bother.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.. get in the way of your \u2018date\u2019,\u201d he said, using finger quotation marks to emphasise date. </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I always go,\u201d you reply, hurt. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Harry said, staring at the ground. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe I won\u2019t,\u201d you retorted.</i></p><p><i>Harry looked back up to see if you were serious. He didn\u2019t actually think you wouldn\u2019t come. Like you said, you always came. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell&hellip;\u201d he started when he saw no glimpse of humour in your eyes. \u201cA true friend would come,\u201d he blurted out. </i></p><p><i>Your jaw dropped. </i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t get me started on what a true friend should do,\u201d you bit back, feeling the anger swell inside you. \u201cHow dare you! I have been the best fucking friend to you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry stepped back, surprised at your outburst. But you weren\u2019t done. All those feelings of neglect and hurt were flying through your brain and suddenly you couldn\u2019t stop them coming out. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI have been by your side through thick and thin! I have been at every match, heard every training debrief, come with you to fucking Australia! I\u2019ve missed work and cancelled holidays to make sure I can be there for you and the one time I want to take a bit of time to myself - to go on a date - of which I haven\u2019t been on in quite awhile I must say! Not that you would know because you never ask - you can\u2019t be a little supportive? No! Because it\u2019s all about you. It\u2019s the Harry show! Well I say no! I won\u2019t give up my life to tennis like you!\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>And now here Y/N was. Sitting in a pub, opposite a lovely guy but unable to forget the image of Harry\u2019s wide eyes and open mouth as she walked away. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Harry was so fucked. He felt like utter shit. He\u2019d been having trouble sleeping ever since Y/N had exploded at the park the other day. This was entirely her fault. But also&hellip; it was entirely his. He knew it. He had hurt her. He\u2019d got so caught up in the game, in himself, that he hadn\u2019t even thought to really check in with Y/N about how she was, if she was okay, if she needed him. Of course Y/N was allowed to go on dates. He didn\u2019t mind. </p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d He hit the ball into the net&hellip; again. He couldn\u2019t lie to himself. This felt wrong. A part of him had always kinda hoped that one day something might happen between him and Y/N. Something wonderful. And now he\u2019d messed it all up and she\u2019d chosen some random guy over him. Just when he needed her the most. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd then they refused to give our bond back! It was so lame.\u201d</p><p>Y/N sighed. Mr Cute-Aussie was turning out to be not-so-cute! Did he really think that telling her about some lads holiday weekend where they trashed their Airbnb was supposed to impress her? Harry would never have done something like that. A true gentleman - whenever he tripped over anything or knocked something over (those giraffe legs are a hazard) he would be bending over backwards to get whatever fixed. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes drifted over to the screen again just in time to see Harry hit the ball into the net. He looked so angry, so hurt, like the ball was personally breaking his heart. She could see his eyes glance over to his coaches box where Y/N normally sat, only to look down even more disheartened and in that moment Y/N realised he was looking for her. He couldn\u2019t focus on the ball because he was upset with her. And the fact that she wasn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d The Aussie added, realising his date\u2019s focus had drifted elsewhere. But Y/N had had enough. </p><p>\u201cActually no. You trashed it. You should pay. Now if you will excuse me, there\u2019s somewhere I need to be.\u201d And with that she picked up her bag, threw some cash on the table, and walked out. </p><p>What was she thinking! How could she have let this happen? How could she have even considered the idea that supporting Harry wasn\u2019t important. They may have fought and he maybe a bit of a jerk sometimes but they were best friends. She loved him. And no Aussie was going to change that. No guy could. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit. I love him,\u201d Y/N said out loud, stopping in the middle of the path. </p><p>Y/N quickly struck out her hand to wave down a taxi and jumped in. She was going to fix this. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>It was half way through the third set. Harry was about 20 minutes away from losing the match and being kicked out of the tournament. And honestly, he couldn\u2019t even find it within himself to care. All he wanted now was to go to bed. And cry a little maybe. He wasn\u2019t normally such a sore loser but he\u2019d never lost <i>her</i> before.</p><p>Out of habit he glanced to her usual spot in the crowd as he bounced the ball preparing to serve. And then he froze. </p><p>She was there. Y/N was sitting right there. It felt like the whole arena was holding there breath as he locked eyes with her across the court. She had one hand over her heart as he saw her mouth those three words that he thought he\u2019d lost all chance of hearing from her lips. I love you. </p><p>Someone was saying something and suddenly everything came back into focus. The ref was telling him to hurry up and he remembered where he was. He threw the ball into the air and hit it as hard as he could across the court. Ace. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd what a match we have here at Rod Laver Arena tonight. The young Brit started off slow but has completely turned around the game! After losing the first two sets I thought he was a goner for sure. What do you think, Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. But as we have seen something has changed within him and he\u2019s had a wave of ..I don\u2019t even know what! Just when we thought it was over he won that third set and then the fourth! And now he\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s positively beaming as he smashes one ace after another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve heard a rumour that it all may be something to do with a new addition to his box. People have been going back through the footage and we think that the change in young Styles behaviour might have something to do with the young girl now sitting there as she wasn\u2019t there to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever it is, it\u2019s working!\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Y/N was freaking out. Harry was suddenly playing brilliantly and had taken the last set to a final tie-breaker. Harry has just got in-front and needed to win this point to win. Her hands wouldn\u2019t stop sweating as she watched on, trying to send waves of love and support into Harry\u2019s head as he set up to serve for the match. </p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d the crowd sighed. Harry\u2019s first serve had gone straight into the net. Fault. </p><p>You can do this, Y/N repeated over and over in her head. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Harry took a deep breath and sneaked one more glance up at Y/N before throwing the ball into the air. </p><p>It was the longest rally yet. Across the court he ran back and forth, up and down until finally his opponent hit one right over his head. Running to chase it, Harry stopped thinking and let his body take over. His arm reached out and just caught the ball before it\u2019s second bounce, whacking it between his legs back across the court. Cheering erupted and Harry thought he must\u2019ve missed but when he turned around he could see British flags being waved in the air and Y/N jumping up and down in her seat. He had won. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop moving the whole post-match interview. All he wanted to do was get to her and now he was finally moving through the corridors backstage, shrugging off people trying to congratulate him. </p><p>And then there she was. She was running towards him and his legs started moving before his brain could catch up and then she was in his arms. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I was the jerk - I should\u2019ve been looking out for you - I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>They parted a bit to look each other in the face. Harry pressed his forehead against hers. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Y/N gasped. And then laughed. Her smile becoming wider and wider. </p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s true! I had to tell you, I\u2019m so- what\u2019s so funny?\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo Harry!\u201d Y/N started, trying to wipe the frown lines off Harry\u2019s face. \u201cI was about to say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s grin was back in full swing as his eyes lowered to Y/N\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u201cAlrighty then,\u201d he whispered before pressing his lips to hers. </p><p>The end.\u00a0</p><p><i>This is my first time writing on here so please\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fireproof-harry.tumblr.com\">let me know what you think!</a>\u00a0</i></p>",

And this trip to Australia was just the icing on the cake. You\u2019d decided to take a stand. </i></p><p><i>\u201cActually H, about the match on Tuesday\u2026\u201d you started, \u201cI might be a little late.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLate?\u201d Harry asked, turning to you, \u201cyou\u2019re never late.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah well I have something on and I\u2019m sure it will probably finish early or you know I can just leave but I\u2019m just letting you know that I\u2019ll be a little late is all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Oh shit.

No\u2026I\u2019m just.. you never \u2026 I didn\u2019t know you were looking to date anyone right now,\u201d Harry stuttered. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s recent,\u201d Y/N answered vaguely, hoping to put an end to this already embarrassing conversation. Y/N and Harry didn\u2019t talk about this stuff. Ever.

Until now. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere\u2019d you meet him?\u201d Harry asked, his full attention now completely on Y/N.</i></p><p><i>The truth is - Y/N met him on a dating app. She hasn\u2019t been out with anyone in ages and she thought what better time to try out a dating app when on the other side of the world? And Lo and behold one of her first matches was a strapping young Aussie whose abs certainly made up for his apparent affinity for beer (Y/N was not a beer drinker). You couldn\u2019t tell Harry this though as he probably wouldn\u2019t see this as important and easy to cancel\u2026 and desperate?</i></p><p><i>\u201cA caf\u00e9,\u201d you lied, \u201cI\u2019d forgotten to bring my Australian money and he offered to pay for my drink,\u201d you made up wildly. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHe seemed really nice and we got talking and now we\u2019re going on a date,\u201d you finished, fingers crossed inside your jacket pocket. </i></p><p><i>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry replied, starting to walk again. You continued in silence for another moment before Harry stopped again. </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut he could be a serial killer!\u201d He exclaimed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him! How do you know what his intentions are?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry I hardly think he\u2019s a serial killer! He seemed really nice and we-\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe not a serial killer but he probably only asked you out because he wants to get into your pants!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh right I get it. You think the only possibly reason someone might ask me out is to have sex with me?\u201d You fired back. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t say-\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you were saying!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was not!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWas too!\u201d</i></p><p><i>The hustle and bustle of the park carried on around you and the two childhood best friends stood face to face, cheeks flushed, in the middle of the path. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat I was trying say\u2026\u201d Harry started, \u201cis that you\u2019re a very um\u2026 attractive woman and that might lead some jerk guy to ask you out with ..um.. not so good intentions!\u201d Harry smiled, seemingly proud of the way he was able to turn that around. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to look out for you Y/N.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can look after myself,\u201d you reply, sick of Harry\u2019s know-it-all attitude. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell I just don\u2019t see why you would want to go on a date with some random guy when you \u2026 had a prior commitment anyway.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHarry, I told you I\u2019m only going to be a little late!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe you shouldn\u2019t even bother.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.. get in the way of your \u2018date\u2019,\u201d he said, using finger quotation marks to emphasise date. </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut I always go,\u201d you reply, hurt. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Harry said, staring at the ground. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell maybe I won\u2019t,\u201d you retorted.</i></p><p><i>Harry looked back up to see if you were serious. He didn\u2019t actually think you wouldn\u2019t come. Like you said, you always came. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he started when he saw no glimpse of humour in your eyes. \u201cA true friend would come,\u201d he blurted out. </i></p><p><i>Your jaw dropped. </i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t get me started on what a true friend should do,\u201d you bit back, feeling the anger swell inside you. \u201cHow dare you! I have been the best fucking friend to you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry stepped back, surprised at your outburst. But you weren\u2019t done. All those feelings of neglect and hurt were flying through your brain and suddenly you couldn\u2019t stop them coming out. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI have been by your side through thick and thin! I have been at every match, heard every training debrief, come with you to fucking Australia! I\u2019ve missed work and cancelled holidays to make sure I can be there for you and the one time I want to take a bit of time to myself - to go on a date - of which I haven\u2019t been on in quite awhile I must say! Not that you would know because you never ask - you can\u2019t be a little supportive? No! Because it\u2019s all about you. It\u2019s the Harry show! Well I say no! I won\u2019t give up my life to tennis like you!\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>And now here Y/N was. Sitting in a pub, opposite a lovely guy but unable to forget the image of Harry\u2019s wide eyes and open mouth as she walked away. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Harry was so fucked. He felt like utter shit. He\u2019d been having trouble sleeping ever since Y/N had exploded at the park the other day. This was entirely her fault. But also\u2026 it was entirely his. He knew it. He had hurt her. He\u2019d got so caught up in the game, in himself, that he hadn\u2019t even thought to really check in with Y/N about how she was, if she was okay, if she needed him. Of course Y/N was allowed to go on dates. He didn\u2019t mind. </p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d He hit the ball into the net\u2026 again. He couldn\u2019t lie to himself. This felt wrong. A part of him had always kinda hoped that one day something might happen between him and Y/N. Something wonderful. And now he\u2019d messed it all up and she\u2019d chosen some random guy over him. Just when he needed her the most. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd then they refused to give our bond back! It was so lame.\u201d</p><p>Y/N sighed. Mr Cute-Aussie was turning out to be not-so-cute! Did he really think that telling her about some lads holiday weekend where they trashed their Airbnb was supposed to impress her? Harry would never have done something like that. A true gentleman - whenever he tripped over anything or knocked something over (those giraffe legs are a hazard) he would be bending over backwards to get whatever fixed. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes drifted over to the screen again just in time to see Harry hit the ball into the net. He looked so angry, so hurt, like the ball was personally breaking his heart. She could see his eyes glance over to his coaches box where Y/N normally sat, only to look down even more disheartened and in that moment Y/N realised he was looking for her. He couldn\u2019t focus on the ball because he was upset with her. And the fact that she wasn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d The Aussie added, realising his date\u2019s focus had drifted elsewhere. But Y/N had had enough. </p><p>\u201cActually no. You trashed it. You should pay. Now if you will excuse me, there\u2019s somewhere I need to be.\u201d And with that she picked up her bag, threw some cash on the table, and walked out. </p><p>What was she thinking! How could she have let this happen? How could she have even considered the idea that supporting Harry wasn\u2019t important. They may have fought and he maybe a bit of a jerk sometimes but they were best friends. She loved him. And no Aussie was going to change that. No guy could. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit. I love him,\u201d Y/N said out loud, stopping in the middle of the path. </p><p>Y/N quickly struck out her hand to wave down a taxi and jumped in. She was going to fix this. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>It was half way through the third set. Harry was about 20 minutes away from losing the match and being kicked out of the tournament. And honestly, he couldn\u2019t even find it within himself to care. All he wanted now was to go to bed. And cry a little maybe. He wasn\u2019t normally such a sore loser but he\u2019d never lost <i>her</i> before.</p><p>Out of habit he glanced to her usual spot in the crowd as he bounced the ball preparing to serve. And then he froze. </p><p>She was there. Y/N was sitting right there. It felt like the whole arena was holding there breath as he locked eyes with her across the court. She had one hand over her heart as he saw her mouth those three words that he thought he\u2019d lost all chance of hearing from her lips. I love you. </p><p>Someone was saying something and suddenly everything came back into focus. The ref was telling him to hurry up and he remembered where he was. He threw the ball into the air and hit it as hard as he could across the court. Ace. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd what a match we have here at Rod Laver Arena tonight. The young Brit started off slow but has completely turned around the game! After losing the first two sets I thought he was a goner for sure. What do you think, Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. But as we have seen something has changed within him and he\u2019s had a wave of ..I don\u2019t even know what! Just when we thought it was over he won that third set and then the fourth! And now he\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s positively beaming as he smashes one ace after another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve heard a rumour that it all may be something to do with a new addition to his box. People have been going back through the footage and we think that the change in young Styles behaviour might have something to do with the young girl now sitting there as she wasn\u2019t there to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever it is, it\u2019s working!\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Y/N was freaking out. Harry was suddenly playing brilliantly and had taken the last set to a final tie-breaker. Harry has just got in-front and needed to win this point to win. Her hands wouldn\u2019t stop sweating as she watched on, trying to send waves of love and support into Harry\u2019s head as he set up to serve for the match. </p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d the crowd sighed. Harry\u2019s first serve had gone straight into the net. Fault. </p><p>You can do this, Y/N repeated over and over in her head. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Harry took a deep breath and sneaked one more glance up at Y/N before throwing the ball into the air. </p><p>It was the longest rally yet. Across the court he ran back and forth, up and down until finally his opponent hit one right over his head. Running to chase it, Harry stopped thinking and let his body take over. His arm reached out and just caught the ball before it\u2019s second bounce, whacking it between his legs back across the court. Cheering erupted and Harry thought he must\u2019ve missed but when he turned around he could see British flags being waved in the air and Y/N jumping up and down in her seat. He had won. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop moving the whole post-match interview. All he wanted to do was get to her and now he was finally moving through the corridors backstage, shrugging off people trying to congratulate him. </p><p>And then there she was. She was running towards him and his legs started moving before his brain could catch up and then she was in his arms. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I was the jerk - I should\u2019ve been looking out for you - I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>They parted a bit to look each other in the face. Harry pressed his forehead against hers. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Y/N gasped. And then laughed. Her smile becoming wider and wider. </p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s true! I had to tell you, I\u2019m so- what\u2019s so funny?\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo Harry!\u201d Y/N started, trying to wipe the frown lines off Harry\u2019s face. \u201cI was about to say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s grin was back in full swing as his eyes lowered to Y/N\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u201cAlrighty then,\u201d he whispered before pressing his lips to hers. </p><p>The end.\u00a0</p><p><i>This is my first time writing on here so please\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fireproof-harry.tumblr.com\">let me know what you think!</a>\u00a0</i></p></p>",

Harry\u2019s already lost the first set and will most likely lose the second, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s on his mind. With his body aching, sweat dripping everywhere, all he can think about is the fact that <i>she\u2019s</i> not here. </p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><p>Y/N feels horrible.

Here she is on a lovely night out with a lovely nice man talking about nice things that aren\u2019t tennis!</p><p>But every time Y/N tries to focus on the blue eyes of her dinner partner all she can think about is the blue court she\u2019d rather be watching\u2026 and how she much prefers green eyes anyway. She\u2019s not supposed to be thinking about <i>those</i> eyes though. Not after the other night.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cAnd then I did my new backhand trick - you know the one I showed you last week? - and he didn\u2019t have a chance!\u201d Harry was always chatty after a good training session and this day was no different. Bouncing a tennis ball along the pavement as they walked through the park, Harry was animatedly describing (and reenacting) his last hour as Y/N nodded along and ooh-ed and ahh-ed on cue.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo I\u2019m feeling pretty confident for Tuesday,\u201d he finished. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s great H,\u201d Y/N said, flashing him a quick smile. </i></p><p><i>It\u2019s not that Y/N didn\u2019t like hearing about Harry\u2019s training, it\u2019s just that Harry trained a lot. And talked about it a lot. Not just the training but everything tennis. Ever since Harry had turned pro it was like there suddenly wasn\u2019t any time for any of their old hobbies or discussion points. No more Harry Potter movie marathons or debates about Marvel vs DC. Just tennis. And while it was great to see Harry gain some hard earned success, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time Harry asked her about her and truly listened to the answer without bouncing a ball or rewatching one of his games in the background.

He didn\u2019t actually think you wouldn\u2019t come. Like you said, you always came. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he started when he saw no glimpse of humour in your eyes. \u201cA true friend would come,\u201d he blurted out. </i></p><p><i>Your jaw dropped. </i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t get me started on what a true friend should do,\u201d you bit back, feeling the anger swell inside you. \u201cHow dare you! I have been the best fucking friend to you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry stepped back, surprised at your outburst. But you weren\u2019t done. All those feelings of neglect and hurt were flying through your brain and suddenly you couldn\u2019t stop them coming out. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI have been by your side through thick and thin! I have been at every match, heard every training debrief, come with you to fucking Australia! I\u2019ve missed work and cancelled holidays to make sure I can be there for you and the one time I want to take a bit of time to myself - to go on a date - of which I haven\u2019t been on in quite awhile I must say! Not that you would know because you never ask - you can\u2019t be a little supportive? No! Because it\u2019s all about you. It\u2019s the Harry show! Well I say no! I won\u2019t give up my life to tennis like you!\u201d</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>And now here Y/N was. Sitting in a pub, opposite a lovely guy but unable to forget the image of Harry\u2019s wide eyes and open mouth as she walked away. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Harry was so fucked. He felt like utter shit. He\u2019d been having trouble sleeping ever since Y/N had exploded at the park the other day. This was entirely her fault. But also\u2026 it was entirely his. He knew it. He had hurt her. He\u2019d got so caught up in the game, in himself, that he hadn\u2019t even thought to really check in with Y/N about how she was, if she was okay, if she needed him. Of course Y/N was allowed to go on dates. He didn\u2019t mind. </p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d He hit the ball into the net\u2026 again. He couldn\u2019t lie to himself. This felt wrong. A part of him had always kinda hoped that one day something might happen between him and Y/N. Something wonderful. And now he\u2019d messed it all up and she\u2019d chosen some random guy over him. Just when he needed her the most. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd then they refused to give our bond back! It was so lame.\u201d</p><p>Y/N sighed. Mr Cute-Aussie was turning out to be not-so-cute! Did he really think that telling her about some lads holiday weekend where they trashed their Airbnb was supposed to impress her? Harry would never have done something like that. A true gentleman - whenever he tripped over anything or knocked something over (those giraffe legs are a hazard) he would be bending over backwards to get whatever fixed. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes drifted over to the screen again just in time to see Harry hit the ball into the net. He looked so angry, so hurt, like the ball was personally breaking his heart. She could see his eyes glance over to his coaches box where Y/N normally sat, only to look down even more disheartened and in that moment Y/N realised he was looking for her. He couldn\u2019t focus on the ball because he was upset with her. And the fact that she wasn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d The Aussie added, realising his date\u2019s focus had drifted elsewhere. But Y/N had had enough. </p><p>\u201cActually no. You trashed it. You should pay. Now if you will excuse me, there\u2019s somewhere I need to be.\u201d And with that she picked up her bag, threw some cash on the table, and walked out. </p><p>What was she thinking! How could she have let this happen? How could she have even considered the idea that supporting Harry wasn\u2019t important. They may have fought and he maybe a bit of a jerk sometimes but they were best friends. She loved him. And no Aussie was going to change that. No guy could. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit. I love him,\u201d Y/N said out loud, stopping in the middle of the path. </p><p>Y/N quickly struck out her hand to wave down a taxi and jumped in. She was going to fix this. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>It was half way through the third set. Harry was about 20 minutes away from losing the match and being kicked out of the tournament. And honestly, he couldn\u2019t even find it within himself to care. All he wanted now was to go to bed. And cry a little maybe. He wasn\u2019t normally such a sore loser but he\u2019d never lost <i>her</i> before.</p><p>Out of habit he glanced to her usual spot in the crowd as he bounced the ball preparing to serve. And then he froze. </p><p>She was there. Y/N was sitting right there. It felt like the whole arena was holding there breath as he locked eyes with her across the court. She had one hand over her heart as he saw her mouth those three words that he thought he\u2019d lost all chance of hearing from her lips. I love you. </p><p>Someone was saying something and suddenly everything came back into focus. The ref was telling him to hurry up and he remembered where he was. He threw the ball into the air and hit it as hard as he could across the court. Ace. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd what a match we have here at Rod Laver Arena tonight. The young Brit started off slow but has completely turned around the game! After losing the first two sets I thought he was a goner for sure. What do you think, Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. But as we have seen something has changed within him and he\u2019s had a wave of ..I don\u2019t even know what! Just when we thought it was over he won that third set and then the fourth! And now he\u2019s smiling. He\u2019s positively beaming as he smashes one ace after another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ve heard a rumour that it all may be something to do with a new addition to his box. People have been going back through the footage and we think that the change in young Styles behaviour might have something to do with the young girl now sitting there as she wasn\u2019t there to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever it is, it\u2019s working!\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Y/N was freaking out. Harry was suddenly playing brilliantly and had taken the last set to a final tie-breaker. Harry has just got in-front and needed to win this point to win. Her hands wouldn\u2019t stop sweating as she watched on, trying to send waves of love and support into Harry\u2019s head as he set up to serve for the match. </p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d the crowd sighed. Harry\u2019s first serve had gone straight into the net. Fault. </p><p>You can do this, Y/N repeated over and over in her head. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Harry took a deep breath and sneaked one more glance up at Y/N before throwing the ball into the air. </p><p>It was the longest rally yet. Across the court he ran back and forth, up and down until finally his opponent hit one right over his head. Running to chase it, Harry stopped thinking and let his body take over. His arm reached out and just caught the ball before it\u2019s second bounce, whacking it between his legs back across the court. Cheering erupted and Harry thought he must\u2019ve missed but when he turned around he could see British flags being waved in the air and Y/N jumping up and down in her seat. He had won. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop moving the whole post-match interview. All he wanted to do was get to her and now he was finally moving through the corridors backstage, shrugging off people trying to congratulate him. </p><p>And then there she was. She was running towards him and his legs started moving before his brain could catch up and then she was in his arms. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I was the jerk - I should\u2019ve been looking out for you - I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>They parted a bit to look each other in the face. Harry pressed his forehead against hers. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Y/N gasped. And then laughed. Her smile becoming wider and wider. </p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s true! I had to tell you, I\u2019m so- what\u2019s so funny?\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo Harry!\u201d Y/N started, trying to wipe the frown lines off Harry\u2019s face. \u201cI was about to say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s grin was back in full swing as his eyes lowered to Y/N\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u201cAlrighty then,\u201d he whispered before pressing his lips to hers. </p><p>The end.\u00a0</p><p><i>This is my first time writing on here so please\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fireproof-harry.tumblr.com\">let me know what you think!</a>\u00a0</i></p></p>",

Harry&rsquo;s already lost the first set and will most likely lose the second, but that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s on his mind. With his body aching, sweat dripping everywhere, all he can think about is the fact that <i>she&rsquo;s</i> not here. </p><p><i>&mdash;</i></p><p>Y/N feels horrible. She&rsquo;s never missed a game. </p><p>Her eyes keep glancing to the corner of the pub where the TV is playing the match live. She can&rsquo;t see the score from where she is but she can tell that he&rsquo;s losing. Badly. </p><p><i>Focus!</i> she tells herself. Here she is on a lovely night out with a lovely nice man talking about nice things that aren&rsquo;t tennis!</p><p>But every time Y/N tries to focus on the blue eyes of her dinner partner all she can think about is the blue court she&rsquo;d rather be watching&hellip; and how she much prefers green eyes anyway. She&rsquo;s not supposed to be thinking about <i>those</i> eyes though. Not after the other night.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;And then I did my new backhand trick - you know the one I showed you last week? - and he didn&rsquo;t have a chance!&rdquo; Harry was always chatty after a good training session and this day was no different. Bouncing a tennis ball along the pavement as they walked through the park, Harry was animatedly describing (and reenacting) his last hour as Y/N nodded along and ooh-ed and ahh-ed on cue.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m feeling pretty confident for Tuesday,&rdquo; he finished. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great H,&rdquo; Y/N said, flashing him a quick smile. </i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s not that Y/N didn&rsquo;t like hearing about Harry&rsquo;s training, it&rsquo;s just that Harry trained a lot. And talked about it a lot. Not just the training but everything tennis. Ever since Harry had turned pro it was like there suddenly wasn&rsquo;t any time for any of their old hobbies or discussion points. No more Harry Potter movie marathons or debates about Marvel vs DC. Just tennis. And while it was great to see Harry gain some hard earned success, she couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time Harry asked her about her and truly listened to the answer without bouncing a ball or rewatching one of his games in the background. And this trip to Australia was just the icing on the cake. You&rsquo;d decided to take a stand. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Actually H, about the match on Tuesday&hellip;&rdquo; you started, &ldquo;I might be a little late.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Late?&rdquo; Harry asked, turning to you, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re never late.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah well I have something on and I&rsquo;m sure it will probably finish early or you know I can just leave but I&rsquo;m just letting you know that I&rsquo;ll be a little late is all.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Oh shit. Now this is not where you wanted to go. You were hoping he would just half listen and nod and move on. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I have a date,&rdquo; you blurt out. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A date?&rdquo; Harry stopped walking. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean you have a date?&rdquo; Harry asked, scoffing as though it was the most ridiculous idea in the world. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Exactly that!&rdquo; replied Y/N indignantly. &ldquo;Why do you sound so surprised? Didn&rsquo;t think anyone would want to take me out?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What? No&hellip;I&rsquo;m just.. you never &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know you were looking to date anyone right now,&rdquo; Harry stuttered. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s recent,&rdquo; Y/N answered vaguely, hoping to put an end to this already embarrassing conversation. Y/N and Harry didn&rsquo;t talk about this stuff. Ever. They could talk for hours about anything and everything but when it came to dating, they led separate lives and pretended not to care about the others. Until now. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you meet him?&rdquo; Harry asked, his full attention now completely on Y/N.</i></p><p><i>The truth is - Y/N met him on a dating app. She hasn&rsquo;t been out with anyone in ages and she thought what better time to try out a dating app when on the other side of the world? And Lo and behold one of her first matches was a strapping young Aussie whose abs certainly made up for his apparent affinity for beer (Y/N was not a beer drinker). You couldn&rsquo;t tell Harry this though as he probably wouldn&rsquo;t see this as important and easy to cancel&hellip; and desperate?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A caf&eacute;,&rdquo; you lied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten to bring my Australian money and he offered to pay for my drink,&rdquo; you made up wildly. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He seemed really nice and we got talking and now we&rsquo;re going on a date,&rdquo; you finished, fingers crossed inside your jacket pocket. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Harry replied, starting to walk again. You continued in silence for another moment before Harry stopped again. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But he could be a serial killer!&rdquo; He exclaimed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him! How do you know what his intentions are?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Harry I hardly think he&rsquo;s a serial killer! He seemed really nice and we-&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well maybe not a serial killer but he probably only asked you out because he wants to get into your pants!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh right I get it.

I had to tell you, I&rsquo;m so- what&rsquo;s so funny?&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No Harry!&rdquo; Y/N started, trying to wipe the frown lines off Harry&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I was about to say that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s grin was back in full swing as his eyes lowered to Y/N&rsquo;s lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Alrighty then,&rdquo; he whispered before pressing his lips to hers. </p><p>The end.&nbsp;</p><p><i>This is my first time writing on here so please&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fireproof-harry.tumblr.com\">let me know what you think!</a>&nbsp;</i></p></p>",

Harry&rsquo;s already lost the first set and will most likely lose the second, but that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s on his mind. With his body aching, sweat dripping everywhere, all he can think about is the fact that <i>she&rsquo;s</i> not here. </p>\n<p><i>&mdash;</i></p>\n<p>Y/N feels horrible. She&rsquo;s never missed a game. </p>\n<p>Her eyes keep glancing to the corner of the pub where the TV is playing the match live. She can&rsquo;t see the score from where she is but she can tell that he&rsquo;s losing. Badly. </p>\n<p><i>Focus!</i> she tells herself. Here she is on a lovely night out with a lovely nice man talking about nice things that aren&rsquo;t tennis!</p>\n<p>But every time Y/N tries to focus on the blue eyes of her dinner partner all she can think about is the blue court she&rsquo;d rather be watching&hellip; and how she much prefers green eyes anyway. She&rsquo;s not supposed to be thinking about <i>those</i> eyes though. Not after the other night.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

And then his lips were crashing against mine, hard and demanding. His hands landed on my hips, one running up the length of my body and tangling in my hair. His tongue ran along the seam of my lips and I gave him what he wanted. Because I wanted it too.</p><p>He pulled away and looked at me funny. &ldquo;Marry me.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a question the way he said it. It was a demand.\u00a0</p><p>And I didn&rsquo;t even think twice about it. &quot;Okay.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>Harry smiled and picked me up, my legs wrapping around his waist. &quot;Alright then, let&rsquo;s go find a priest.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it was the alcohol or Harry, but Devon never even crossed my mind.\u00a0</p><p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>It was raining. Again. It had rained <g class=\"gr_ gr_489 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"489\" data-gr-id=\"489\">everyday</g> for the past week and I was getting really tired of riding my bike around in it. Not to mention, I was supposed to meet Mac at La Val\u2019s Pizza 5 minutes ago. She knew I was prone to lateness though, so she usually told me to be somewhere 15 minutes before she actually wanted me there. Which is why she was my best friend.</p><p>My bike screeched up to the front of La Val\u2019s just as Mac rounded the corner.</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_482 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"482\" data-gr-id=\"482\">Hey</g> Kitty Cat!\u201d She said, sticking her tongue out as she came towards me. Her ratty blonde hair was up in a bun and her small frame was huddled under her bright yellow rain jacket. I had to look just as good in my old black leather jacket and sweatpants.</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>Mac walked to the door, holding it open for me as I locked up my bike. \u201cHurry up before I melt!\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I forgot that you\u2019re a witch,\u201d I said, snorting.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She elongated the \u201cO\u201d, rounding her lips exaggeratedly. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m made of sugar!\u201d she said, shivering in her rain boots. \u201cNow hurry!\u201d</p><p>My bike lock clicked closed and I ran to the door and inside the warm dry restaurant, Mac following close behind.</p><p>I grabbed a table while she went up to order our usual: a large beef, onion, and green pepper pizza. Mac found me a couple of minutes later, Lori Jones in tow.</p><p>\u201cLook who I found!\u201d She sat down across from me, pulling Lori in next to her. Lori was a freshman who had a single dorm just down the hall from us. She was pretty enough, with her short brown hair and large green eyes, and nice enough definitely. The thing about Lori though, was that she was overly obsessive. I mean yeah, sure I have my leather jackets and Mac had Spongebob but Lori got obsessive about everything. For example, as soon as her butt hit the seat, she wouldn\u2019t shut up about One Direction.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing The Greek Theatre tonight <g class=\"gr_ gr_485 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"485\" data-gr-id=\"485\">y\u2019know</g>. That\u2019s literally 5 minutes away from my dorm. Aren\u2019t you excited? I\u2019m <g class=\"gr_ gr_486 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"486\" data-gr-id=\"486\">soooo</g> excited. I mean so what I\u2019ve seen them live 7 times already. I could always go for an 8th! Or even a 9th! Or a billionth really. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of them. They\u2019re debuting a song tonight <g class=\"gr_ gr_487 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"487\" data-gr-id=\"487\">y\u2019know</g>. My ovaries are going to explode, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p><p>Mac put a hand over Lori\u2019s, quieting her. \u201cYeah it sounds great and all but Cat and I aren\u2019t even going tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! That\u2019s crazy! Why not! I mean it\u2019s a free One Direction concert! You guys are crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot crazy,\u201d I put in. \u201cJust not fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t like their music!\u201d She looked appalled and enraged at the same time. Like she couldn\u2019t imagine a teenage girl who wasn\u2019t a fan of boyband-pop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like it,\u201d Mac said, looking to me for help because she did, in fact, hate everything having to do with One Direction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more that we just have a lot to do and aren\u2019t big enough fans to go. I have all their stuff on my phone, I just don\u2019t have a desire to hear it live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s exactly it,\u201d Mac said, looking quite relieved.</p><p>Just then, the pizzas arrived. We were silent as we ate.</p><p>At 6, Lori practically ran out of the pizza shop so she\u2019d have enough time to get ready.</p><p>Mac and I left a couple of minutes later, me on my bike and her on foot. I rode slowly, never getting more than a couple feet in front of her. It was only drizzling then, and we talked as we walked.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d she started. \u201cI think I might have a crush on Lori. I mean, there\u2019s the whole \u2018I\u2019m in love with One Direction, who are boys, therefore I\u2019m straight\u2019 thing, but that\u2019s really just a small issue.\u201d Mac was gay. Like, painfully so sometimes. We\u2019d been friends since 8th grade and while she\u2019d only come out of the closet after we graduated, I\u2019d known since the beginning. People asked me if it was weird, sharing a dorm room with her, but she swore she hadn\u2019t even entertained the possibility of us being together since 10th grade when she\u2019d had a \u2018Cat is my soulmate\u2019 spell. I trusted her and she trusted me and she was my best friend whether she liked to have sexual relations with boys or not.</p><p>I laughed, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s really a tiny problem, easy to work around.\u201d She shoved me lightly, almost knocking me off my bike. \u201cWhat was that for?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were patronizing me. You with your perfect boyfriend and <g class=\"gr_ gr_478 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"478\" data-gr-id=\"478\">great</g> relationship. I can\u2019t believe you and Devon have been together for almost 2 years.\u201d She sighed, almost longingly.</p><p>\u201cYup, our anniversary is on Thursday.\u201d I got smiley just thinking of Devon. He and his twin brother, and my longtime friend, Ryan, had spent the last week in L.A. because Ryan had a dancing gig there. Dev was supposed to be home tomorrow and I couldn\u2019t wait to see him.</p><p>My train of thought was interrupted by Mac suddenly shouting.</p><p>\u201cWhat the..? Mac are you alright?\u201d She was looking down at her phone, her mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cLook at this picture Annie just sent me of Megan! Look at it!\u201d She shoved her screen in my face. On it was a picture of Megan Fox in a bikini. Spongebob and Megan Fox were Mac\u2019s 2 and only loves.</p><p>I just shook my head and pulled my bike up the steps to the front door of Stern Residential Hall. It was on the NE corner of Cal\u2019s campus and only a couple minute walk to all of my classes. I adored it.</p><p>Mac caught up to me as I locked my bike up. Her phone was away now. \u201cI\u2019m so drained from work today but I have an essay due on Monday and I just want to watch Spongebob all day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I have loads of homework too,\u201d I said, pulling the door open.</p><p>\u201cSuprise!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat? What the? Ohhh. <g class=\"gr_ gr_473 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"473\" data-gr-id=\"473\">You</g> idiot! You <i>know</i> she hates surprises!\u201d</p><p>My eyes were squeezed shut and all I could hear was Mac\u2019s loud yelling. Until: \u201cCat baby I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you or upset you. I just wanted to do something nice. I\u2019m <g class=\"gr_ gr_515 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"515\" data-gr-id=\"515\">sorry</g> baby. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And lean arms wrapped themselves around my small frame and lifted me to my toes. My eyes fluttered open to see my boyfriend&rsquo;s extremely apologetic face.</p><p>\u201cDevon! You weren&rsquo;t supposed to be home until tomorrow!\u201d I cuddled my face into his chest, inhaling his scent of pine before looking up to take in the sight of him again. His brown hair laid flat on his head but his hazel eyes were alight. I sighed with happiness to just be near him again.</p><p>\u201cYou alright now?\u201d He asked, putting me back down.</p><p>I nodded, snuggling into his side. He laughed and stepped away, making me look up at him. His usually confident air was suddenly <g class=\"gr_ gr_476 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"476\" data-gr-id=\"476\">shaky,</g> like he was nervous. \u201cHey, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I cocked my head to the side, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI have something very important to ask you,\u201d he said, before dropping down to one knee. I could feel my mouth drop open, dread running through my body.\u00a0</p><p>He could not be doing this. Not now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCatherine Lauren Herrara, will you marry me?\u201d His hopeful hazel eyes shown up at me as time slowed down. I couldn\u2019t say yes. I wasn\u2019t ready to get married. I mean, I loved Devon and I planned to marry him someday, just not any day soon. I loved my life the way it was. No, no he couldn\u2019t do this to me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him by saying no, but I wasn\u2019t ready to say yes. I could feel tears slipping from my eyes and my fight or flight reaction kicked in.</p><p>I fled.</p><p>Up 3 flights of stairs and down the hall to dorm number 308. I was shaking and couldn\u2019t my key in the door. I could hear Devon, Ryan, and Mac running towards me, making me panicky. I finally got the key in, unlocked the door, and ran inside, slamming it closed behind me. I heard Mac sliding in her key, and I curled up into a ball on my bed, waiting for them to all come pouring in. But Mac shut the door before either of the twins could make it through.</p><p>\u201cI love you, babe. No matter what. Please, talk to me,\u201d Devon said from outside.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Dev. Give her a bit. We\u2019ll talk later okay?\u201d Mac said back.</p><p><br/>\u201cYeah, alright. Love you, Cat.\u201d</p><p>Mac came and sat on the edge of my twin bed, stroking my hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong babe? I thought you loved him?\u201d</p><p>I sat up and sighed, wiping the tears from my face. \u201cI do, Mac, I do. I really really do. I\u2019m just not ready to marry him. I just\u2026 I like the way things are and I\u2019m not ready for them to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just tell him that? He\u2019d understand. Or at least try, for you. He loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that he looked so hopeful, I just couldn\u2019t say no and crush him. I love him too much.\u201d Mac nods, getting up. Well, how about we blast some music and get some schoolwork done? Nothing numbs your brain like good <g class=\"gr_ gr_484 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"484\" data-gr-id=\"484\">ol</g>\u2019 homework.\u201d</p><hr><p><br/></p><p>After struggling through my schoolwork for a solid 4 hours, I was exhausted and my stomach was screaming for food. I was a person who had to eat at least 2 hours before I could fall asleep so I couldn&rsquo;t eat much. My stomach growled again and Mac, who&rsquo;d gone to sleep hours ago, rolled over in her bed. I internally groaned, mind made up. I grabbed my computer and quietly snuck out of the room, tiptoed down the hall, and jumped in the elevator. When I made my way downstairs, I noticed a sleeping form on the couch in the lobby. Tiptoeing closer, I about gasped when I realized it was Devon. He slept here?! Did he think I&rsquo;d eventually come down and talk to him? Was he planning on ambushing me when I came down in the morning?</p><p>I watched him sleep for a moment. He was agitated, tossing and turning. Without thinking I laid a hand on his shoulder. He calmed. I quickly pulled my hand back and walked to the door, looking over my shoulder as I pulled it open.</p><p>I left my bike locked up and quickly hopped down the stairs to the street. It was a 5-minute walk to my favorite coffee shop, Brewed Awakening, which was open till 2am. I walked along, lost in my thoughts.</p><p>I loved Devon, I did, but I couldn&rsquo;t get married, not with both my parents <i>and</i> my brother in the middle of a divorce. Devon knew my views on marriage. I had to be able to support myself before I got married. I needed a degree and a good job. I needed things to fall back on for when the inevitable happened.</p><p>I reached the coffee shop then and pulled the door open. Cathy was behind the counter. She was a senior majoring in news writing and I knew her from my creative writing class. She had talent. &quot;Hey, Cat. Coming from the concert?&rdquo; She must not have seen my laptop.</p><p>I chuckled a little. &ldquo;Nah, not me,&rdquo; I said, holding my computer up. &ldquo;Sucks you had to work tonight though if you wanted to go.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not a fan. Greg&rsquo;s paying me <g class=\"gr_ gr_495 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"495\" data-gr-id=\"495\">double</g> for this shift actually because I&rsquo;m the only one willing to work tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh nice,&rdquo; I said, giving her a thumbs up. &ldquo;Anyway, can I just get a hot chocolate please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; I handed her a five dollar bill and she handed me the change back. &ldquo;You alright hon?&rdquo;</p><p>I shook my head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, I&rsquo;m just arguing with Devon right now. He assured me he understood something and then turned around and proved he actually had no fucking clue.&rdquo; I shrugged, frowning.</p><p>Cathy nodded, humming in understanding before turning to make my chocolate milk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll come around. But honestly, as perfect for each other as you two are, I&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;ve lasted this long. You&rsquo;re both so young, barely 20. You don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s anyone else, any other type of person you fit with. I&rsquo;ve been with Tyler for three years but I had a whole year of crazy partying and one night stands. All the experimentation out of my system. Neither of you had that. And I guess some people don&rsquo;t need it and I don&rsquo;t want to say that your happiness isn&rsquo;t valid, it just surprises me.&rdquo;</p><p>She works as she talks, finishing just as she ends her last sentence. &ldquo;Just think about it,&rdquo; she says, handing me the hot cup.</p><p>I nod, processing her words. She&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;d never been with anyone else. I hadn&rsquo;t had a serious boyfriend in high school and I&rsquo;d been with Devon for both my years of college. I&rsquo;d never gone out and danced with strangers or gotten blackout drunk and woken up in bed with someone whose name I didn&rsquo;t know. And these were experiences I wanted before I got married; before I even <i>considered</i> diving into that pool.</p><p>I sighed, sliding into a booth in the corner and opening my computer. My blog, Poetry Flowers, had hit 1 million visitors sometime that day and I decided a new poem and a thank you post was in order. All my attention went to that and I didn&rsquo;t notice when the doorbell dinged, or when the two other customers practically shrieked, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t notice when someone slid into the seat across from mine.</p><p>Which is why I jumped when he said hello.</p><p>My head shot up and I locked eyes with a pair of bright green irises. I raked my eyes up to his dark brown hair and then down to his thin lips. Harry Styles sat in front of me.</p><p>&ldquo;Urm. Can I help you?&rdquo; I asked, in slight shock.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He slid his hands behind his head and leaned back, looking very at ease.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. So why are you sitting in my booth?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this your booth? I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t realize you owned it.&rdquo; He smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t own it, but I&rsquo;m sitting here right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On that side, yeah. So you can have that side, and I&rsquo;ll take this one.&rdquo;</p><p>I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s really not how it works.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in. \u201cLook, this is the only place where no one can see me walking by. Please just let me sit here for a bit. I\u2019m exhausted and I don\u2019t think I can handle any more autographs.\u201d His eyes are pleading, his face sad.</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, nodding my head a bit before going back to my blog. I\u2019d written a poem already for the 1 million view occasion but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to post it. I put up one I&rsquo;d written during one of my homework breaks earlier, about Devon.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, what are you typing so intensely?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d was my only reply. Suddenly, he shot up from his seat and slid in right next to me, his side pressing against mine.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI was just 18 when we met</p><p>On the train to nowhere</p><p>But now we\u2019re somewhere</p><p>I never meant to be</p><p>And I loved you for miles</p><p>Your smile was my heartbeat</p><p>And that was quite a feat</p><p>For someone without one</p><p>You know everything there is to know</p><p>But I don\u2019t think you understand</p><p>I left my heart unmanned</p><p>And you tore it apart</p><p>Now I\u2019m running in circles</p><p>Scared out of my mind</p><p>You say the stars aligned</p><p>For us that day</p><p>But I can\u2019t bring myself to believe a single word you say\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s pretty good. Did you write that?\u201d He turns his face toward mine, leaving us just inches apart. My eyes fall to his lips, causing me to bite my own. I notice his eyes drop to where my teeth are dragging over my bottom lip. I want to lean in and kiss him, and I almost do when my head snaps back in place. What am I doing?! I have a boyfriend.</p><p>I swing my head around to face my laptop, breaking eye contact with Harry. I shake my head before answering. \u201cYeah, I wrote it. And you read it. Even though I really didn\u2019t want you to.\u201d I add a \u201cSorry it\u2019s so sad but thank you guys so much for over a million visits!!\u201d to the bottom and hit <g class=\"gr_ gr_500 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"500\" data-gr-id=\"500\">post</g>, all while Harry is still breathing down my neck.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be about someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Cathy appears. \u201cHere\u2019s your coffee, Mr. Styles. I hope you like it. Hey, Cat.\u201d She waves and walks away whistling, not realizing what she\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cCat, huh? Like a kitty cat? I like it. What\u2019s it short for?\u201d He takes a sip of his coffee. As if he needs more energy.</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. \u201cOkay fine. Whatever, Kitty Cat, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and take in a deep breath. Harry Styles is much more annoying than I thought he\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m out now. Thank you for letting me sit in not-your-booth.\u201d He shoots me a wink. \u201cHope I see you around.\u201d</p><p>He gets up and walks out, looking back as he opens the door. I sigh deeply, letting my head drop to my keyboard.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m exhausted.\u00a0</p><p>I drain the rest of my hot chocolate and shut down my computer before waving goodbye to Cathy and leaving the coffee shop. A pool of girls stands on the sidewalk, surrounding Harry. He fakes smiles and laughs and signs a dozen things and I watch him for a moment, amazed at how well he handles the attention. He looks up just as I think that I should look away. Our eyes meet. He smiles, a real one, before going back to his audience.</p><p>I walk back home and climb in bed, my <g class=\"gr_ gr_490 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"490\" data-gr-id=\"490\">mind</g> louder than ever.\u00a0</p>",

Her ratty blonde hair was up in a bun and her small frame was huddled under her bright yellow rain jacket. I had to look just as good in my old black leather jacket and sweatpants.</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>Mac walked to the door, holding it open for me as I locked up my bike. \u201cHurry up before I melt!\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I forgot that you\u2019re a witch,\u201d I said, snorting.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She elongated the \u201cO\u201d, rounding her lips exaggeratedly. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m made of sugar!\u201d she said, shivering in her rain boots. \u201cNow hurry!\u201d</p><p>My bike lock clicked closed and I ran to the door and inside the warm dry restaurant, Mac following close behind.</p><p>I grabbed a table while she went up to order our usual: a large beef, onion, and green pepper pizza. Mac found me a couple of minutes later, Lori Jones in tow.</p><p>\u201cLook who I found!\u201d She sat down across from me, pulling Lori in next to her. Lori was a freshman who had a single dorm just down the hall from us. She was pretty enough, with her short brown hair and large green eyes, and nice enough definitely. The thing about Lori though, was that she was overly obsessive. I mean yeah, sure I have my leather jackets and Mac had Spongebob but Lori got obsessive about everything. For example, as soon as her butt hit the seat, she wouldn\u2019t shut up about One Direction.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing The Greek Theatre tonight <g class=\"gr_ gr_485 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"485\" data-gr-id=\"485\">y\u2019know</g>. That\u2019s literally 5 minutes away from my dorm. Aren\u2019t you excited? I\u2019m <g class=\"gr_ gr_486 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"486\" data-gr-id=\"486\">soooo</g> excited. I mean so what I\u2019ve seen them live 7 times already. I could always go for an 8th! Or even a 9th! Or a billionth really. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of them. They\u2019re debuting a song tonight <g class=\"gr_ gr_487 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"487\" data-gr-id=\"487\">y\u2019know</g>. My ovaries are going to explode, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p><p>Mac put a hand over Lori\u2019s, quieting her. \u201cYeah it sounds great and all but Cat and I aren\u2019t even going tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! That\u2019s crazy! Why not! I mean it\u2019s a free One Direction concert! You guys are crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot crazy,\u201d I put in. \u201cJust not fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t like their music!\u201d She looked appalled and enraged at the same time. Like she couldn\u2019t imagine a teenage girl who wasn\u2019t a fan of boyband-pop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like it,\u201d Mac said, looking to me for help because she did, in fact, hate everything having to do with One Direction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more that we just have a lot to do and aren\u2019t big enough fans to go. I have all their stuff on my phone, I just don\u2019t have a desire to hear it live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s exactly it,\u201d Mac said, looking quite relieved.</p><p>Just then, the pizzas arrived. We were silent as we ate.</p><p>At 6, Lori practically ran out of the pizza shop so she\u2019d have enough time to get ready.</p><p>Mac and I left a couple of minutes later, me on my bike and her on foot. I rode slowly, never getting more than a couple feet in front of her. It was only drizzling then, and we talked as we walked.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d she started. \u201cI think I might have a crush on Lori. I mean, there\u2019s the whole \u2018I\u2019m in love with One Direction, who are boys, therefore I\u2019m straight\u2019 thing, but that\u2019s really just a small issue.\u201d Mac was gay. Like, painfully so sometimes. We\u2019d been friends since 8th grade and while she\u2019d only come out of the closet after we graduated, I\u2019d known since the beginning. People asked me if it was weird, sharing a dorm room with her, but she swore she hadn\u2019t even entertained the possibility of us being together since 10th grade when she\u2019d had a \u2018Cat is my soulmate\u2019 spell. I trusted her and she trusted me and she was my best friend whether she liked to have sexual relations with boys or not.</p><p>I laughed, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s really a tiny problem, easy to work around.\u201d She shoved me lightly, almost knocking me off my bike. \u201cWhat was that for?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were patronizing me. You with your perfect boyfriend and <g class=\"gr_ gr_478 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"478\" data-gr-id=\"478\">great</g> relationship. I can\u2019t believe you and Devon have been together for almost 2 years.\u201d She sighed, almost longingly.</p><p>\u201cYup, our anniversary is on Thursday.\u201d I got smiley just thinking of Devon. He and his twin brother, and my longtime friend, Ryan, had spent the last week in L.A. because Ryan had a dancing gig there. Dev was supposed to be home tomorrow and I couldn\u2019t wait to see him.</p><p>My train of thought was interrupted by Mac suddenly shouting.</p><p>\u201cWhat the..? Mac are you alright?\u201d She was looking down at her phone, her mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cLook at this picture Annie just sent me of Megan! Look at it!\u201d She shoved her screen in my face. On it was a picture of Megan Fox in a bikini. Spongebob and Megan Fox were Mac\u2019s 2 and only loves.</p><p>I just shook my head and pulled my bike up the steps to the front door of Stern Residential Hall. It was on the NE corner of Cal\u2019s campus and only a couple minute walk to all of my classes. I adored it.</p><p>Mac caught up to me as I locked my bike up. Her phone was away now. \u201cI\u2019m so drained from work today but I have an essay due on Monday and I just want to watch Spongebob all day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I have loads of homework too,\u201d I said, pulling the door open.</p><p>\u201cSuprise!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat? What the? Ohhh. <g class=\"gr_ gr_473 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"473\" data-gr-id=\"473\">You</g> idiot! You <i>know</i> she hates surprises!\u201d</p><p>My eyes were squeezed shut and all I could hear was Mac\u2019s loud yelling. Until: \u201cCat baby I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you or upset you. I just wanted to do something nice. I\u2019m <g class=\"gr_ gr_515 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"515\" data-gr-id=\"515\">sorry</g> baby. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And lean arms wrapped themselves around my small frame and lifted me to my toes. My eyes fluttered open to see my boyfriend\u2019s extremely apologetic face.</p><p>\u201cDevon! You weren\u2019t supposed to be home until tomorrow!\u201d I cuddled my face into his chest, inhaling his scent of pine before looking up to take in the sight of him again. His brown hair laid flat on his head but his hazel eyes were alight. I sighed with happiness to just be near him again.</p><p>\u201cYou alright now?\u201d He asked, putting me back down.</p><p>I nodded, snuggling into his side. He laughed and stepped away, making me look up at him. His usually confident air was suddenly <g class=\"gr_ gr_476 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"476\" data-gr-id=\"476\">shaky,</g> like he was nervous. \u201cHey, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I cocked my head to the side, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI have something very important to ask you,\u201d he said, before dropping down to one knee. I could feel my mouth drop open, dread running through my body.\u00a0</p><p>He could not be doing this. Not now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCatherine Lauren Herrara, will you marry me?\u201d His hopeful hazel eyes shown up at me as time slowed down. I couldn\u2019t say yes. I wasn\u2019t ready to get married. I mean, I loved Devon and I planned to marry him someday, just not any day soon. I loved my life the way it was. No, no he couldn\u2019t do this to me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him by saying no, but I wasn\u2019t ready to say yes. I could feel tears slipping from my eyes and my fight or flight reaction kicked in.</p><p>I fled.</p><p>Up 3 flights of stairs and down the hall to dorm number 308. I was shaking and couldn\u2019t my key in the door. I could hear Devon, Ryan, and Mac running towards me, making me panicky. I finally got the key in, unlocked the door, and ran inside, slamming it closed behind me. I heard Mac sliding in her key, and I curled up into a ball on my bed, waiting for them to all come pouring in. But Mac shut the door before either of the twins could make it through.</p><p>\u201cI love you, babe. No matter what. Please, talk to me,\u201d Devon said from outside.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Dev. Give her a bit. We\u2019ll talk later okay?\u201d Mac said back.</p><p><br>\u201cYeah, alright. Love you, Cat.\u201d</p><p>Mac came and sat on the edge of my twin bed, stroking my hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong babe? I thought you loved him?\u201d</p><p>I sat up and sighed, wiping the tears from my face. \u201cI do, Mac, I do. I really really do. I\u2019m just not ready to marry him. I just\u2026 I like the way things are and I\u2019m not ready for them to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just tell him that? He\u2019d understand. Or at least try, for you. He loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that he looked so hopeful, I just couldn\u2019t say no and crush him. I love him too much.\u201d Mac nods, getting up. Well, how about we blast some music and get some schoolwork done? Nothing numbs your brain like good <g class=\"gr_ gr_484 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"484\" data-gr-id=\"484\">ol</g>\u2019 homework.\u201d</p><hr><p><br></p><p>After struggling through my schoolwork for a solid 4 hours, I was exhausted and my stomach was screaming for food. I was a person who had to eat at least 2 hours before I could fall asleep so I couldn\u2019t eat much. My stomach growled again and Mac, who\u2019d gone to sleep hours ago, rolled over in her bed. I internally groaned, mind made up. I grabbed my computer and quietly snuck out of the room, tiptoed down the hall, and jumped in the elevator. When I made my way downstairs, I noticed a sleeping form on the couch in the lobby. Tiptoeing closer, I about gasped when I realized it was Devon. He slept here?! Did he think I\u2019d eventually come down and talk to him? Was he planning on ambushing me when I came down in the morning?</p><p>I watched him sleep for a moment. He was agitated, tossing and turning. Without thinking I laid a hand on his shoulder. He calmed. I quickly pulled my hand back and walked to the door, looking over my shoulder as I pulled it open.</p><p>I left my bike locked up and quickly hopped down the stairs to the street. It was a 5-minute walk to my favorite coffee shop, Brewed Awakening, which was open till 2am. I walked along, lost in my thoughts.</p><p>I loved Devon, I did, but I couldn\u2019t get married, not with both my parents <i>and</i> my brother in the middle of a divorce. Devon knew my views on marriage. I had to be able to support myself before I got married. I needed a degree and a good job. I needed things to fall back on for when the inevitable happened.</p><p>I reached the coffee shop then and pulled the door open. Cathy was behind the counter. She was a senior majoring in news writing and I knew her from my creative writing class. She had talent. \"Hey, Cat. Coming from the concert?\u201d She must not have seen my laptop.</p><p>I chuckled a little. \u201cNah, not me,\u201d I said, holding my computer up. \u201cSucks you had to work tonight though if you wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a fan. Greg\u2019s paying me <g class=\"gr_ gr_495 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"495\" data-gr-id=\"495\">double</g> for this shift actually because I\u2019m the only one willing to work tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh nice,\u201d I said, giving her a thumbs up. \u201cAnyway, can I just get a hot chocolate please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I handed her a five dollar bill and she handed me the change back. \u201cYou alright hon?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just arguing with Devon right now. He assured me he understood something and then turned around and proved he actually had no fucking clue.\u201d I shrugged, frowning.</p><p>Cathy nodded, humming in understanding before turning to make my chocolate milk. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around. But honestly, as perfect for each other as you two are, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve lasted this long. You\u2019re both so young, barely 20. You don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anyone else, any other type of person you fit with. I\u2019ve been with Tyler for three years but I had a whole year of crazy partying and one night stands. All the experimentation out of my system. Neither of you had that. And I guess some people don\u2019t need it and I don\u2019t want to say that your happiness isn\u2019t valid, it just surprises me.\u201d</p><p>She works as she talks, finishing just as she ends her last sentence. \u201cJust think about it,\u201d she says, handing me the hot cup.</p><p>I nod, processing her words. She\u2019s right. I\u2019d never been with anyone else. I hadn\u2019t had a serious boyfriend in high school and I\u2019d been with Devon for both my years of college. I\u2019d never gone out and danced with strangers or gotten blackout drunk and woken up in bed with someone whose name I didn\u2019t know. And these were experiences I wanted before I got married; before I even <i>considered</i> diving into that pool.</p><p>I sighed, sliding into a booth in the corner and opening my computer. My blog, Poetry Flowers, had hit 1 million visitors sometime that day and I decided a new poem and a thank you post was in order. All my attention went to that and I didn\u2019t notice when the doorbell dinged, or when the two other customers practically shrieked, and I certainly didn\u2019t notice when someone slid into the seat across from mine.</p><p>Which is why I jumped when he said hello.</p><p>My head shot up and I locked eyes with a pair of bright green irises. I raked my eyes up to his dark brown hair and then down to his thin lips. Harry Styles sat in front of me.</p><p>\u201cUrm. Can I help you?\u201d I asked, in slight shock.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slid his hands behind his head and leaned back, looking very at ease.</p><p>\u201cOh. So why are you sitting in my booth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your booth? I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you owned it.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own it, but I\u2019m sitting here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that side, yeah. So you can have that side, and I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s really not how it works.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in. \u201cLook, this is the only place where no one can see me walking by. Please just let me sit here for a bit. I\u2019m exhausted and I don\u2019t think I can handle any more autographs.\u201d His eyes are pleading, his face sad.</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, nodding my head a bit before going back to my blog. I\u2019d written a poem already for the 1 million view occasion but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to post it. I put up one I\u2019d written during one of my homework breaks earlier, about Devon.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, what are you typing so intensely?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d was my only reply. Suddenly, he shot up from his seat and slid in right next to me, his side pressing against mine.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was just 18 when we met</p><p>On the train to nowhere</p><p>But now we\u2019re somewhere</p><p>I never meant to be</p><p>And I loved you for miles</p><p>Your smile was my heartbeat</p><p>And that was quite a feat</p><p>For someone without one</p><p>You know everything there is to know</p><p>But I don\u2019t think you understand</p><p>I left my heart unmanned</p><p>And you tore it apart</p><p>Now I\u2019m running in circles</p><p>Scared out of my mind</p><p>You say the stars aligned</p><p>For us that day</p><p>But I can\u2019t bring myself to believe a single word you say\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s pretty good. Did you write that?\u201d He turns his face toward mine, leaving us just inches apart. My eyes fall to his lips, causing me to bite my own. I notice his eyes drop to where my teeth are dragging over my bottom lip. I want to lean in and kiss him, and I almost do when my head snaps back in place. What am I doing?! I have a boyfriend.</p><p>I swing my head around to face my laptop, breaking eye contact with Harry. I shake my head before answering. \u201cYeah, I wrote it. And you read it. Even though I really didn\u2019t want you to.\u201d I add a \u201cSorry it\u2019s so sad but thank you guys so much for over a million visits!!\u201d to the bottom and hit <g class=\"gr_ gr_500 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"500\" data-gr-id=\"500\">post</g>, all while Harry is still breathing down my neck.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be about someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Cathy appears. \u201cHere\u2019s your coffee, Mr. Styles. I hope you like it. Hey, Cat.\u201d She waves and walks away whistling, not realizing what she\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cCat, huh? Like a kitty cat? I like it. What\u2019s it short for?\u201d He takes a sip of his coffee. As if he needs more energy.</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. \u201cOkay fine. Whatever, Kitty Cat, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and take in a deep breath. Harry Styles is much more annoying than I thought he\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m out now. Thank you for letting me sit in not-your-booth.\u201d He shoots me a wink. \u201cHope I see you around.\u201d</p><p>He gets up and walks out, looking back as he opens the door. I sigh deeply, letting my head drop to my keyboard.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m exhausted.\u00a0</p><p>I drain the rest of my hot chocolate and shut down my computer before waving goodbye to Cathy and leaving the coffee shop. A pool of girls stands on the sidewalk, surrounding Harry. He fakes smiles and laughs and signs a dozen things and I watch him for a moment, amazed at how well he handles the attention. He looks up just as I think that I should look away. Our eyes meet. He smiles, a real one, before going back to his audience.</p><p>I walk back home and climb in bed, my <g class=\"gr_ gr_490 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"490\" data-gr-id=\"490\">mind</g> louder than ever.\u00a0</p>",

Again. It had rained <g class=\"gr_ gr_489 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"489\" data-gr-id=\"489\">everyday</g> for the past week and I was getting really tired of riding my bike around in it. Not to mention, I was supposed to meet Mac at La Val\u2019s Pizza 5 minutes ago. She knew I was prone to lateness though, so she usually told me to be somewhere 15 minutes before she actually wanted me there. Which is why she was my best friend.</p><p>My bike screeched up to the front of La Val\u2019s just as Mac rounded the corner.</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_482 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"482\" data-gr-id=\"482\">Hey</g> Kitty Cat!\u201d She said, sticking her tongue out as she came towards me. Her ratty blonde hair was up in a bun and her small frame was huddled under her bright yellow rain jacket. I had to look just as good in my old black leather jacket and sweatpants.</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>Mac walked to the door, holding it open for me as I locked up my bike. \u201cHurry up before I melt!\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I forgot that you\u2019re a witch,\u201d I said, snorting.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She elongated the \u201cO\u201d, rounding her lips exaggeratedly. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m made of sugar!\u201d she said, shivering in her rain boots. \u201cNow hurry!\u201d</p><p>My bike lock clicked closed and I ran to the door and inside the warm dry restaurant, Mac following close behind.</p><p>I grabbed a table while she went up to order our usual: a large beef, onion, and green pepper pizza. Mac found me a couple of minutes later, Lori Jones in tow.</p><p>\u201cLook who I found!\u201d She sat down across from me, pulling Lori in next to her. Lori was a freshman who had a single dorm just down the hall from us. She was pretty enough, with her short brown hair and large green eyes, and nice enough definitely. The thing about Lori though, was that she was overly obsessive. I mean yeah, sure I have my leather jackets and Mac had Spongebob but Lori got obsessive about everything. For example, as soon as her butt hit the seat, she wouldn\u2019t shut up about One Direction.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing The Greek Theatre tonight <g class=\"gr_ gr_485 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"485\" data-gr-id=\"485\">y\u2019know</g>. That\u2019s literally 5 minutes away from my dorm. Aren\u2019t you excited? I\u2019m <g class=\"gr_ gr_486 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"486\" data-gr-id=\"486\">soooo</g> excited. I mean so what I\u2019ve seen them live 7 times already. I could always go for an 8th! Or even a 9th! Or a billionth really. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of them. They\u2019re debuting a song tonight <g class=\"gr_ gr_487 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"487\" data-gr-id=\"487\">y\u2019know</g>. My ovaries are going to explode, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p><p>Mac put a hand over Lori\u2019s, quieting her. \u201cYeah it sounds great and all but Cat and I aren\u2019t even going tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! That\u2019s crazy! Why not! I mean it\u2019s a free One Direction concert! You guys are crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot crazy,\u201d I put in. \u201cJust not fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t like their music!\u201d She looked appalled and enraged at the same time. Like she couldn\u2019t imagine a teenage girl who wasn\u2019t a fan of boyband-pop.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like it,\u201d Mac said, looking to me for help because she did, in fact, hate everything having to do with One Direction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more that we just have a lot to do and aren\u2019t big enough fans to go. I have all their stuff on my phone, I just don\u2019t have a desire to hear it live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s exactly it,\u201d Mac said, looking quite relieved.</p><p>Just then, the pizzas arrived. We were silent as we ate.</p><p>At 6, Lori practically ran out of the pizza shop so she\u2019d have enough time to get ready.</p><p>Mac and I left a couple of minutes later, me on my bike and her on foot. I rode slowly, never getting more than a couple feet in front of her. It was only drizzling then, and we talked as we walked.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d she started. \u201cI think I might have a crush on Lori. I mean, there\u2019s the whole \u2018I\u2019m in love with One Direction, who are boys, therefore I\u2019m straight\u2019 thing, but that\u2019s really just a small issue.\u201d Mac was gay. Like, painfully so sometimes. We\u2019d been friends since 8th grade and while she\u2019d only come out of the closet after we graduated, I\u2019d known since the beginning. People asked me if it was weird, sharing a dorm room with her, but she swore she hadn\u2019t even entertained the possibility of us being together since 10th grade when she\u2019d had a \u2018Cat is my soulmate\u2019 spell. I trusted her and she trusted me and she was my best friend whether she liked to have sexual relations with boys or not.</p><p>I laughed, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s really a tiny problem, easy to work around.\u201d She shoved me lightly, almost knocking me off my bike. \u201cWhat was that for?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were patronizing me. You with your perfect boyfriend and <g class=\"gr_ gr_478 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"478\" data-gr-id=\"478\">great</g> relationship. I can\u2019t believe you and Devon have been together for almost 2 years.\u201d She sighed, almost longingly.</p><p>\u201cYup, our anniversary is on Thursday.\u201d I got smiley just thinking of Devon. He and his twin brother, and my longtime friend, Ryan, had spent the last week in L.A. because Ryan had a dancing gig there. Dev was supposed to be home tomorrow and I couldn\u2019t wait to see him.</p><p>My train of thought was interrupted by Mac suddenly shouting.</p><p>\u201cWhat the..? Mac are you alright?\u201d She was looking down at her phone, her mouth wide open.</p><p>\u201cLook at this picture Annie just sent me of Megan! Look at it!\u201d She shoved her screen in my face. On it was a picture of Megan Fox in a bikini. Spongebob and Megan Fox were Mac\u2019s 2 and only loves.</p><p>I just shook my head and pulled my bike up the steps to the front door of Stern Residential Hall. It was on the NE corner of Cal\u2019s campus and only a couple minute walk to all of my classes. I adored it.</p><p>Mac caught up to me as I locked my bike up. Her phone was away now. \u201cI\u2019m so drained from work today but I have an essay due on Monday and I just want to watch Spongebob all day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I have loads of homework too,\u201d I said, pulling the door open.</p><p>\u201cSuprise!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat? What the? Ohhh. <g class=\"gr_ gr_473 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"473\" data-gr-id=\"473\">You</g> idiot! You <i>know</i> she hates surprises!\u201d</p><p>My eyes were squeezed shut and all I could hear was Mac\u2019s loud yelling. Until: \u201cCat baby I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you or upset you. I just wanted to do something nice.

I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And lean arms wrapped themselves around my small frame and lifted me to my toes. My eyes fluttered open to see my boyfriend\u2019s extremely apologetic face.</p><p>\u201cDevon! You weren\u2019t supposed to be home until tomorrow!\u201d I cuddled my face into his chest, inhaling his scent of pine before looking up to take in the sight of him again. His brown hair laid flat on his head but his hazel eyes were alight. I sighed with happiness to just be near him again.</p><p>\u201cYou alright now?\u201d He asked, putting me back down.</p><p>I nodded, snuggling into his side. He laughed and stepped away, making me look up at him. His usually confident air was suddenly <g class=\"gr_ gr_476 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"476\" data-gr-id=\"476\">shaky,</g> like he was nervous. \u201cHey, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I cocked my head to the side, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI have something very important to ask you,\u201d he said, before dropping down to one knee. I could feel my mouth drop open, dread running through my body.\u00a0</p><p>He could not be doing this. Not now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCatherine Lauren Herrara, will you marry me?\u201d His hopeful hazel eyes shown up at me as time slowed down. I couldn\u2019t say yes. I wasn\u2019t ready to get married. I mean, I loved Devon and I planned to marry him someday, just not any day soon. I loved my life the way it was. No, no he couldn\u2019t do this to me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him by saying no, but I wasn\u2019t ready to say yes. I could feel tears slipping from my eyes and my fight or flight reaction kicked in.</p><p>I fled.</p><p>Up 3 flights of stairs and down the hall to dorm number 308. I was shaking and couldn\u2019t my key in the door. I could hear Devon, Ryan, and Mac running towards me, making me panicky. I finally got the key in, unlocked the door, and ran inside, slamming it closed behind me. I heard Mac sliding in her key, and I curled up into a ball on my bed, waiting for them to all come pouring in. But Mac shut the door before either of the twins could make it through.</p><p>\u201cI love you, babe. No matter what. Please, talk to me,\u201d Devon said from outside.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Dev. Give her a bit. We\u2019ll talk later okay?\u201d Mac said back.</p><p><br>\u201cYeah, alright. Love you, Cat.\u201d</p><p>Mac came and sat on the edge of my twin bed, stroking my hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong babe? I thought you loved him?\u201d</p><p>I sat up and sighed, wiping the tears from my face. \u201cI do, Mac, I do. I really really do. I\u2019m just not ready to marry him. I just\u2026 I like the way things are and I\u2019m not ready for them to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just tell him that? He\u2019d understand. Or at least try, for you. He loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that he looked so hopeful, I just couldn\u2019t say no and crush him. I love him too much.\u201d Mac nods, getting up. Well, how about we blast some music and get some schoolwork done? Nothing numbs your brain like good <g class=\"gr_ gr_484 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling\" id=\"484\" data-gr-id=\"484\">ol</g>\u2019 homework.\u201d</p><hr><p><br></p><p>After struggling through my schoolwork for a solid 4 hours, I was exhausted and my stomach was screaming for food. I was a person who had to eat at least 2 hours before I could fall asleep so I couldn\u2019t eat much. My stomach growled again and Mac, who\u2019d gone to sleep hours ago, rolled over in her bed. I internally groaned, mind made up. I grabbed my computer and quietly snuck out of the room, tiptoed down the hall, and jumped in the elevator. When I made my way downstairs, I noticed a sleeping form on the couch in the lobby. Tiptoeing closer, I about gasped when I realized it was Devon. He slept here?! Did he think I\u2019d eventually come down and talk to him? Was he planning on ambushing me when I came down in the morning?</p><p>I watched him sleep for a moment. He was agitated, tossing and turning. Without thinking I laid a hand on his shoulder. He calmed. I quickly pulled my hand back and walked to the door, looking over my shoulder as I pulled it open.</p><p>I left my bike locked up and quickly hopped down the stairs to the street. It was a 5-minute walk to my favorite coffee shop, Brewed Awakening, which was open till 2am. I walked along, lost in my thoughts.</p><p>I loved Devon, I did, but I couldn\u2019t get married, not with both my parents <i>and</i> my brother in the middle of a divorce. Devon knew my views on marriage. I had to be able to support myself before I got married. I needed a degree and a good job. I needed things to fall back on for when the inevitable happened.</p><p>I reached the coffee shop then and pulled the door open. Cathy was behind the counter. She was a senior majoring in news writing and I knew her from my creative writing class. She had talent. \"Hey, Cat. Coming from the concert?\u201d She must not have seen my laptop.</p><p>I chuckled a little. \u201cNah, not me,\u201d I said, holding my computer up. \u201cSucks you had to work tonight though if you wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a fan. Greg\u2019s paying me <g class=\"gr_ gr_495 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"495\" data-gr-id=\"495\">double</g> for this shift actually because I\u2019m the only one willing to work tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh nice,\u201d I said, giving her a thumbs up. \u201cAnyway, can I just get a hot chocolate please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I handed her a five dollar bill and she handed me the change back. \u201cYou alright hon?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just arguing with Devon right now. He assured me he understood something and then turned around and proved he actually had no fucking clue.\u201d I shrugged, frowning.</p><p>Cathy nodded, humming in understanding before turning to make my chocolate milk. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come around. But honestly, as perfect for each other as you two are, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve lasted this long. You\u2019re both so young, barely 20. You don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anyone else, any other type of person you fit with. I\u2019ve been with Tyler for three years but I had a whole year of crazy partying and one night stands. All the experimentation out of my system. Neither of you had that. And I guess some people don\u2019t need it and I don\u2019t want to say that your happiness isn\u2019t valid, it just surprises me.\u201d</p><p>She works as she talks, finishing just as she ends her last sentence. \u201cJust think about it,\u201d she says, handing me the hot cup.</p><p>I nod, processing her words. She\u2019s right. I\u2019d never been with anyone else. I hadn\u2019t had a serious boyfriend in high school and I\u2019d been with Devon for both my years of college. I\u2019d never gone out and danced with strangers or gotten blackout drunk and woken up in bed with someone whose name I didn\u2019t know. And these were experiences I wanted before I got married; before I even <i>considered</i> diving into that pool.</p><p>I sighed, sliding into a booth in the corner and opening my computer. My blog, Poetry Flowers, had hit 1 million visitors sometime that day and I decided a new poem and a thank you post was in order. All my attention went to that and I didn\u2019t notice when the doorbell dinged, or when the two other customers practically shrieked, and I certainly didn\u2019t notice when someone slid into the seat across from mine.</p><p>Which is why I jumped when he said hello.</p><p>My head shot up and I locked eyes with a pair of bright green irises. I raked my eyes up to his dark brown hair and then down to his thin lips. Harry Styles sat in front of me.</p><p>\u201cUrm. Can I help you?\u201d I asked, in slight shock.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slid his hands behind his head and leaned back, looking very at ease.</p><p>\u201cOh. So why are you sitting in my booth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your booth? I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you owned it.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own it, but I\u2019m sitting here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that side, yeah. So you can have that side, and I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s really not how it works.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in. \u201cLook, this is the only place where no one can see me walking by. Please just let me sit here for a bit. I\u2019m exhausted and I don\u2019t think I can handle any more autographs.\u201d His eyes are pleading, his face sad.</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, nodding my head a bit before going back to my blog. I\u2019d written a poem already for the 1 million view occasion but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to post it. I put up one I\u2019d written during one of my homework breaks earlier, about Devon.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, what are you typing so intensely?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d was my only reply. Suddenly, he shot up from his seat and slid in right next to me, his side pressing against mine.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI was just 18 when we met</p><p>On the train to nowhere</p><p>But now we\u2019re somewhere</p><p>I never meant to be</p><p>And I loved you for miles</p><p>Your smile was my heartbeat</p><p>And that was quite a feat</p><p>For someone without one</p><p>You know everything there is to know</p><p>But I don\u2019t think you understand</p><p>I left my heart unmanned</p><p>And you tore it apart</p><p>Now I\u2019m running in circles</p><p>Scared out of my mind</p><p>You say the stars aligned</p><p>For us that day</p><p>But I can\u2019t bring myself to believe a single word you say\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s pretty good. Did you write that?\u201d He turns his face toward mine, leaving us just inches apart. My eyes fall to his lips, causing me to bite my own. I notice his eyes drop to where my teeth are dragging over my bottom lip. I want to lean in and kiss him, and I almost do when my head snaps back in place. What am I doing?! I have a boyfriend.</p><p>I swing my head around to face my laptop, breaking eye contact with Harry. I shake my head before answering. \u201cYeah, I wrote it. And you read it. Even though I really didn\u2019t want you to.\u201d I add a \u201cSorry it\u2019s so sad but thank you guys so much for over a million visits!!\u201d to the bottom and hit <g class=\"gr_ gr_500 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"500\" data-gr-id=\"500\">post</g>, all while Harry is still breathing down my neck.</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be about someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Cathy appears. \u201cHere\u2019s your coffee, Mr. Styles. I hope you like it. Hey, Cat.\u201d She waves and walks away whistling, not realizing what she\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cCat, huh? Like a kitty cat? I like it. What\u2019s it short for?\u201d He takes a sip of his coffee. As if he needs more energy.</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. \u201cOkay fine. Whatever, Kitty Cat, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and take in a deep breath. Harry Styles is much more annoying than I thought he\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m out now. Thank you for letting me sit in not-your-booth.\u201d He shoots me a wink. \u201cHope I see you around.\u201d</p><p>He gets up and walks out, looking back as he opens the door. I sigh deeply, letting my head drop to my keyboard.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m exhausted.\u00a0</p><p>I drain the rest of my hot chocolate and shut down my computer before waving goodbye to Cathy and leaving the coffee shop. A pool of girls stands on the sidewalk, surrounding Harry. He fakes smiles and laughs and signs a dozen things and I watch him for a moment, amazed at how well he handles the attention. He looks up just as I think that I should look away. Our eyes meet. He smiles, a real one, before going back to his audience.</p><p>I walk back home and climb in bed, my <g class=\"gr_ gr_490 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"490\" data-gr-id=\"490\">mind</g> louder than ever.\u00a0</p>",

And then his lips were crashing against mine, hard and demanding. His hands landed on my hips, one running up the length of my body and tangling in my hair. His tongue ran along the seam of my lips and I gave him what he wanted. Because I wanted it too.</p><p>He pulled away and looked at me funny. &ldquo;Marry me.\"&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a question the way he said it. It was a demand.&nbsp;</p><p>And I didn&rsquo;t even think twice about it. \"Okay.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Harry smiled and picked me up, my legs wrapping around his waist. \"Alright then, let&rsquo;s go find a priest.\"&nbsp;</p><p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it was the alcohol or Harry, but Devon never even crossed my mind.&nbsp;</p><p><b><br /><br /></b></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>It was raining. Again. It had rained everyday for the past week and I was getting really tired of riding my bike around in it. Not to mention, I was supposed to meet Mac at La Val&rsquo;s Pizza 5 minutes ago. She knew I was prone to lateness though, so she usually told me to be somewhere 15 minutes before she actually wanted me there. Which is why she was my best friend.</p><p>My bike screeched up to the front of La Val&rsquo;s just as Mac rounded the corner.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Kitty Cat!&rdquo; She said, sticking her tongue out as she came towards me. Her ratty blonde hair was up in a bun and her small frame was huddled under her bright yellow rain jacket. I had to look just as good in my old black leather jacket and sweatpants.</p><p><br /></p><p>Mac walked to the door, holding it open for me as I locked up my bike. &ldquo;Hurry up before I melt!&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I forgot that you&rsquo;re a witch,&rdquo; I said, snorting.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She elongated the &ldquo;O&rdquo;, rounding her lips exaggeratedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m made of sugar!&rdquo; she said, shivering in her rain boots. &ldquo;Now hurry!&rdquo;</p><p>My bike lock clicked closed and I ran to the door and inside the warm dry restaurant, Mac following close behind.</p><p>I grabbed a table while she went up to order our usual: a large beef, onion, and green pepper pizza. Mac found me a couple of minutes later, Lori Jones in tow.</p><p>&ldquo;Look who I found!&rdquo; She sat down across from me, pulling Lori in next to her. Lori was a freshman who had a single dorm just down the hall from us. She was pretty enough, with her short brown hair and large green eyes, and nice enough definitely. The thing about Lori though, was that she was overly obsessive. I mean yeah, sure I have my leather jackets and Mac had Spongebob but Lori got obsessive about everything. For example, as soon as her butt hit the seat, she wouldn&rsquo;t shut up about One Direction.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re playing The Greek Theatre tonight y&rsquo;know. That&rsquo;s literally 5 minutes away from my dorm. Aren&rsquo;t you excited? I&rsquo;m soooo excited. I mean so what I&rsquo;ve seen them live 7 times already. I could always go for an 8th! Or even a 9th! Or a billionth really. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get tired of them. They&rsquo;re debuting a song tonight y&rsquo;know. My ovaries are going to explode, I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo;</p><p>Mac put a hand over Lori&rsquo;s, quieting her. &ldquo;Yeah it sounds great and all but Cat and I aren&rsquo;t even going tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! That&rsquo;s crazy! Why not! I mean it&rsquo;s a free One Direction concert! You guys are crazy!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not crazy,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;Just not fans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys don&rsquo;t like their music!&rdquo; She looked appalled and enraged at the same time. Like she couldn&rsquo;t imagine a teenage girl who wasn&rsquo;t a fan of boyband-pop.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Mac said, looking to me for help because she did, in fact, hate everything having to do with One Direction.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more that we just have a lot to do and aren&rsquo;t big enough fans to go. I have all their stuff on my phone, I just don&rsquo;t have a desire to hear it live.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s exactly it,&rdquo; Mac said, looking quite relieved.</p><p>Just then, the pizzas arrived. We were silent as we ate.</p><p>At 6, Lori practically ran out of the pizza shop so she&rsquo;d have enough time to get ready.</p><p>Mac and I left a couple of minutes later, me on my bike and her on foot. I rode slowly, never getting more than a couple feet in front of her. It was only drizzling then, and we talked as we walked.</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know,&rdquo; she started. &ldquo;I think I might have a crush on Lori. I mean, there&rsquo;s the whole &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in love with One Direction, who are boys, therefore I&rsquo;m straight&rsquo; thing, but that&rsquo;s really just a small issue.&rdquo; Mac was gay. Like, painfully so sometimes. We&rsquo;d been friends since 8th grade and while she&rsquo;d only come out of the closet after we graduated, I&rsquo;d known since the beginning. People asked me if it was weird, sharing a dorm room with her, but she swore she hadn&rsquo;t even entertained the possibility of us being together since 10th grade when she&rsquo;d had a &lsquo;Cat is my soulmate&rsquo; spell. I trusted her and she trusted me and she was my best friend whether she liked to have sexual relations with boys or not.</p><p>I laughed, &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s really a tiny problem, easy to work around.&rdquo; She shoved me lightly, almost knocking me off my bike. &ldquo;What was that for?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were patronizing me. You with your perfect boyfriend and great relationship. I can&rsquo;t believe you and Devon have been together for almost 2 years.&rdquo; She sighed, almost longingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, our anniversary is on Thursday.&rdquo; I got smiley just thinking of Devon. He and his twin brother, and my longtime friend, Ryan, had spent the last week in L.A. because Ryan had a dancing gig there. Dev was supposed to be home tomorrow and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to see him.</p><p>My train of thought was interrupted by Mac suddenly shouting.</p><p>&ldquo;What the..? Mac are you alright?&rdquo; She was looking down at her phone, her mouth wide open.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at this picture Annie just sent me of Megan! Look at it!&rdquo; She shoved her screen in my face. On it was a picture of Megan Fox in a bikini. Spongebob and Megan Fox were Mac&rsquo;s 2 and only loves.</p><p>I just shook my head and pulled my bike up the steps to the front door of Stern Residential Hall. It was on the NE corner of Cal&rsquo;s campus and only a couple minute walk to all of my classes. I adored it.</p><p>Mac caught up to me as I locked my bike up. Her phone was away now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so drained from work today but I have an essay due on Monday and I just want to watch Spongebob all day tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I have loads of homework too,&rdquo; I said, pulling the door open.</p><p>&ldquo;Suprise!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cat? What the? Ohhh. You idiot! You <i>know</i> she hates surprises!&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes were squeezed shut and all I could hear was Mac&rsquo;s loud yelling. Until: &ldquo;Cat baby I&rsquo;m so sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you or upset you. I just wanted to do something nice. I&rsquo;m sorry baby. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; And lean arms wrapped themselves around my small frame and lifted me to my toes. My eyes fluttered open to see my boyfriend&rsquo;s extremely apologetic face.</p><p>&ldquo;Devon! You weren&rsquo;t supposed to be home until tomorrow!&rdquo; I cuddled my face into his chest, inhaling his scent of pine before looking up to take in the sight of him again. His brown hair laid flat on his head but his hazel eyes were alight. I sighed with happiness to just be near him again.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright now?&rdquo; He asked, putting me back down.</p><p>I nodded, snuggling into his side. He laughed and stepped away, making me look up at him. His usually confident air was suddenly shaky, like he was nervous. &ldquo;Hey, babe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; I cocked my head to the side, waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;I have something very important to ask you,&rdquo; he said, before dropping down to one knee. I could feel my mouth drop open, dread running through my body.&nbsp;</p><p>He could not be doing this. Not now.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Catherine Lauren Herrara, will you marry me?&rdquo; His hopeful hazel eyes shown up at me as time slowed down. I couldn&rsquo;t say yes. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to get married. I mean, I loved Devon and I planned to marry him someday, just not any day soon. I loved my life the way it was. No, no he couldn&rsquo;t do this to me. I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt him by saying no, but I wasn&rsquo;t ready to say yes. I could feel tears slipping from my eyes and my fight or flight reaction kicked in.</p><p>I fled.</p><p>Up 3 flights of stairs and down the hall to dorm number 308. I was shaking and couldn&rsquo;t my key in the door. I could hear Devon, Ryan, and Mac running towards me, making me panicky. I finally got the key in, unlocked the door, and ran inside, slamming it closed behind me. I heard Mac sliding in her key, and I curled up into a ball on my bed, waiting for them to all come pouring in. But Mac shut the door before either of the twins could make it through.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, babe. No matter what. Please, talk to me,&rdquo; Devon said from outside.</p><p>&ldquo;Go away, Dev. Give her a bit. We&rsquo;ll talk later okay?&rdquo; Mac said back.</p><p><br />&ldquo;Yeah, alright. Love you, Cat.&rdquo;</p><p>Mac came and sat on the edge of my twin bed, stroking my hair. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong babe? I thought you loved him?&rdquo;</p><p>I sat up and sighed, wiping the tears from my face. &ldquo;I do, Mac, I do. I really really do. I&rsquo;m just not ready to marry him. I just&hellip; I like the way things are and I&rsquo;m not ready for them to change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you just tell him that? He&rsquo;d understand. Or at least try, for you. He loves you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s just that he looked so hopeful, I just couldn&rsquo;t say no and crush him. I love him too much.&rdquo; Mac nods, getting up. Well, how about we blast some music and get some schoolwork done? Nothing numbs your brain like good ol&rsquo; homework.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>After struggling through my schoolwork for a solid 4 hours, I was exhausted and my stomach was screaming for food.

He assured me he understood something and then turned around and proved he actually had no fucking clue.&rdquo; I shrugged, frowning.</p><p>Cathy nodded, humming in understanding before turning to make my chocolate milk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll come around. But honestly, as perfect for each other as you two are, I&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;ve lasted this long. You&rsquo;re both so young, barely 20. You don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s anyone else, any other type of person you fit with. I&rsquo;ve been with Tyler for three years but I had a whole year of crazy partying and one night stands. All the experimentation out of my system. Neither of you had that. And I guess some people don&rsquo;t need it and I don&rsquo;t want to say that your happiness isn&rsquo;t valid, it just surprises me.&rdquo;</p><p>She works as she talks, finishing just as she ends her last sentence. &ldquo;Just think about it,&rdquo; she says, handing me the hot cup.</p><p>I nod, processing her words. She&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;d never been with anyone else. I hadn&rsquo;t had a serious boyfriend in high school and I&rsquo;d been with Devon for both my years of college. I&rsquo;d never gone out and danced with strangers or gotten blackout drunk and woken up in bed with someone whose name I didn&rsquo;t know. And these were experiences I wanted before I got married; before I even <i>considered</i> diving into that pool.</p><p>I sighed, sliding into a booth in the corner and opening my computer. My blog, Poetry Flowers, had hit 1 million visitors sometime that day and I decided a new poem and a thank you post was in order. All my attention went to that and I didn&rsquo;t notice when the doorbell dinged, or when the two other customers practically shrieked, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t notice when someone slid into the seat across from mine.</p><p>Which is why I jumped when he said hello.</p><p>My head shot up and I locked eyes with a pair of bright green irises. I raked my eyes up to his dark brown hair and then down to his thin lips. Harry Styles sat in front of me.</p><p>&ldquo;Urm. Can I help you?&rdquo; I asked, in slight shock.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He slid his hands behind his head and leaned back, looking very at ease.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. So why are you sitting in my booth?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this your booth? I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t realize you owned it.&rdquo; He smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t own it, but I&rsquo;m sitting here right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On that side, yeah. So you can have that side, and I&rsquo;ll take this one.&rdquo;</p><p>I furrowed my eyebrows. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really not how it works.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned in. &ldquo;Look, this is the only place where no one can see me walking by. Please just let me sit here for a bit. I&rsquo;m exhausted and I don&rsquo;t think I can handle any more autographs.&rdquo; His eyes are pleading, his face sad.</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, nodding my head a bit before going back to my blog. I&rsquo;d written a poem already for the 1 million view occasion but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to post it. I put up one I&rsquo;d written during one of my homework breaks earlier, about Devon.</p><p>&ldquo;So, um, what are you typing so intensely?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;None of your business,&rdquo; was my only reply. Suddenly, he shot up from his seat and slid in right next to me, his side pressing against mine.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was just 18 when we met</p><p>On the train to nowhere</p><p>But now we&rsquo;re somewhere</p><p>I never meant to be</p><p>And I loved you for miles</p><p>Your smile was my heartbeat</p><p>And that was quite a feat</p><p>For someone without one</p><p>You know everything there is to know</p><p>But I don&rsquo;t think you understand</p><p>I left my heart unmanned</p><p>And you tore it apart</p><p>Now I&rsquo;m running in circles</p><p>Scared out of my mind</p><p>You say the stars aligned</p><p>For us that day</p><p>But I can&rsquo;t bring myself to believe a single word you say&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow. That&rsquo;s pretty good. Did you write that?&rdquo; He turns his face toward mine, leaving us just inches apart. My eyes fall to his lips, causing me to bite my own. I notice his eyes drop to where my teeth are dragging over my bottom lip. I want to lean in and kiss him, and I almost do when my head snaps back in place. What am I doing?! I have a boyfriend.</p><p>I swing my head around to face my laptop, breaking eye contact with Harry. I shake my head before answering. &ldquo;Yeah, I wrote it. And you read it. Even though I really didn&rsquo;t want you to.&rdquo; I add a &ldquo;Sorry it&rsquo;s so sad but thank you guys so much for over a million visits!!&rdquo; to the bottom and hit post, all while Harry is still breathing down my neck.</p><p>&ldquo;So who&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It has to be about someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, Cathy appears. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your coffee, Mr. Styles. I hope you like it. Hey, Cat.&rdquo; She waves and walks away whistling, not realizing what she&rsquo;s done.</p><p>&ldquo;Cat, huh? Like a kitty cat? I like it. What&rsquo;s it short for?&rdquo; He takes a sip of his coffee. As if he needs more energy.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t reply. &ldquo;Okay fine. Whatever, Kitty Cat, don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>I close my eyes and take in a deep breath. Harry Styles is much more annoying than I thought he&rsquo;d be.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m out now. Thank you for letting me sit in not-your-booth.&rdquo; He shoots me a wink. &ldquo;Hope I see you around.&rdquo;</p><p>He gets up and walks out, looking back as he opens the door. I sigh deeply, letting my head drop to my keyboard.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m exhausted.&nbsp;</p><p>I drain the rest of my hot chocolate and shut down my computer before waving goodbye to Cathy and leaving the coffee shop. A pool of girls stands on the sidewalk, surrounding Harry. He fakes smiles and laughs and signs a dozen things and I watch him for a moment, amazed at how well he handles the attention. He looks up just as I think that I should look away. Our eyes meet. He smiles, a real one, before going back to his audience.</p><p>I walk back home and climb in bed, my mind louder than ever.&nbsp;</p>",

We&rsquo;re not thinking straight.&rdquo; My voice was shaky as I took a step a backwards, shivering when my back hit the wall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can think just fine,&rdquo; he purred, leaning in. And then his lips were crashing against mine, hard and demanding. His hands landed on my hips, one running up the length of my body and tangling in my hair. His tongue ran along the seam of my lips and I gave him what he wanted. Because I wanted it too.</p>\n<p>He pulled away and looked at me funny. &ldquo;Marry me.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a question the way he said it. It was a demand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even think twice about it. \"Okay.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Harry smiled and picked me up, my legs wrapping around his waist. \"Alright then, let&rsquo;s go find a priest.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it was the alcohol or Harry, but Devon never even crossed my mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><br /><br /></b></p>\n<p>Chapter One</p>\n<p>It was raining. Again. It had rained everyday for the past week and I was getting really tired of riding my bike around in it. Not to mention, I was supposed to meet Mac at La Val&rsquo;s Pizza 5 minutes ago. She knew I was prone to lateness though, so she usually told me to be somewhere 15 minutes before she actually wanted me there. Which is why she was my best friend.</p>\n<p>My bike screeched up to the front of La Val&rsquo;s just as Mac rounded the corner.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Kitty Cat!&rdquo; She said, sticking her tongue out as she came towards me. Her ratty blonde hair was up in a bun and her small frame was huddled under her bright yellow rain jacket. I had to look just as good in my old black leather jacket and sweatpants.</p>\n</p>",
