I hope your Christmas days were filled with love and laughter and may all your dreams come true in 2019!</b></p><blockquote><p><small>Jon is planning on spending Christmas Eve all alone with a few good books, but Sansa heard so many stories about the astronomy student from her brother Robb that she just has to get to know him and she forces him to join her to the Christmas party downstairs.</small></p><p><small><i>Modern AU // College AU</i></small></p></blockquote><p>Jon looked up from his book when he heard a soft knock on the door of his dorm. His long black curls were messy and he was wearing nothing but a simple jeans and a white shirt. To be honest, he hadn\u2019t really expected anyone.</p><p>After all, it was Christmas Eve and he guessed that most people had better things to do today. Like visiting their family, eating way too much and watching silly Christmas movies they had already seen at least a million times.</p><p>Whoever was knocking on his door however knocked again and with a sigh Jon stood up and walked towards the wooden door. He was still holding his book when he opened the door only a little bit.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow.\u201d A beautiful red head smiled at him and for a moment Jon could just stare.</p><p>It was only after a couple of very long seconds that he realized he\u2019d have to say something. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me?\u201d He cocked his head and the beautiful red head raised her eyebrows and crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing all alone in your room on Christmas Eve?\u201d She lifted her chin a little and Jon realized he had to look up to look her in the eyes. \u201cThe entire house is having a party downstairs in the living room. You should come too.\u201d</p><p>Jon scratched the back of his neck and he swallowed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not really the party kind of type. Ask my dorm mates. I\u2019m the boring astronomy nerd who ruins the fun in every conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just talked to Robb about that and told him to shut up about it.\u201d The girl shrugged and she shifted her weight from one foot to the other. Her legs were long and the black dress she wore barely reached her knees. \u201cNo one should be alone with Christmas. And don\u2019t tell me that your books and stars are all the company you need, because that\u2019s bullshit and you know it.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Jon opened his mouth to say something, but closed it again when the right reply didn\u2019t really come to mind. What was there to say when a beautiful girl spoke words that were nothing but the truth?</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna open that door a little further to come out or are you gonna keep me waiting for the rest of the evening?\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head and all of a sudden he realized he was not really dressed for a Christmas party. \u201cGive me five minutes. I need to change. I wasn\u2019t really planning on seeing anyone today.\u201d He licked his dry lips and then he furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I have something that fits\u2026\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. The red haired girl grabbed his hand and pulled him out of his room. The book he was reading fell on the floor and he quickly grabbed his key before the door locked behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s a student party, not a family gathering with your in laws.\u201d She kept on holding onto his hand while she walked to the stairs, as if she was afraid that he\u2019d turn around if she\u2019d let him go. And maybe she was right.</p><p>He would turn around if she\u2019d let his hand go.</p><p>Her high heels echoed through the hallway while they walked down the stairs. When they neared the living room, he could hear the voices, the music and the failing attempts to sing along with the Christmas songs that were playing.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t really want to be here. This was not something he enjoyed. Not even on Christmas Eve. He\u2019d much rather spent his evening in absolute silence, finishing a book or two. At some point he\u2019d maybe order something like pizza, or he\u2019d just look in the fridge to see if anyone had forgotten anything in there. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Robb Stark walked towards him with a glass of champagne in one hand and a big grin on his handsome face. He was wearing a simple black jacket, combined with a white shirt and his jeans, but still he looked like a prince charming, straight out of a fairytale. \u201cI see you met my sister Sansa already?\u201d He nodded at the red haired girl still holding Jon\u2019s hand. \u201cShe&rsquo;s a noble soul, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled, but he was not sure what to answer. \u201cWe&rsquo;ll see about that in a few hours. Maybe spending Christmas alone isn\u2019t that bad compared to being at a party where you don\u2019t really belong.\u201d</p><p>Robb wrapped an arm around Jon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOf course you belong here! You don\u2019t get our jokes and ruin every lighthearted conversation with something highly deep and intelligent we don\u2019t understand, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t love you. You\u2019re our residential nerd! This house wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Jon wasn\u2019t really sure what to say, but eventually he murmured. \u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Sansa gestured towards the kitchen. \u201cWe should get something to eat and drink.\u201d She led Jon away from the crowd and in the kitchen she finally let his hand go and leaned against the counter. \u201cMy brother never told me you were this handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome?\u201d Jon\u2019s hand went through his hair and he looked around to make sure she had been talking to him and not to anyone else. \u201cYou think I\u2019m handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are!\u201d She raised her voice and placed her hands on his shoulders. \u201cYou really are, Jon.\u201d She nodded once more and her red lips curled up into a bright smile. \u201cI&rsquo;ve heard loads of stories about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they all came from Robb, I doubt if it were just good things.\u201d Jon smirked and he tucked a loose curl behind his ear. </p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Sansa raised her voice. \u201cHe really likes you, I swear.\u201d Her arms circled around his neck and Jon swallowed. \u201cHe also told me that for good book recommendations, you are the man to go to.\u201d She cocked her head. </p><p>Jon felt a little uncomfortable and he curled his fingers around her wrist. \u201cLook\u2026\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI&rsquo;m not really the type to just kiss and sleep with a pretty girl only for her to move on in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Sansa widened her eyes and her jaw dropped, but she kept her arms firmly in place. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIs that really what you think I\u2019m doing here? Do you really think I just want to kiss and sleep with you and forget about you in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Jon kept silent, but Sansa looked at him as if she was really expecting him to answer the question. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Jon freed himself from her embrace and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m not that good at flirting and the whole game. I never really know what people want and I just know what I don\u2019t want and\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa pressed a finger to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss much, actually. Mostly the game ends in utter disappointment anyway.\u201d She pulled her finger back and the smile on her face faded a little. \u201cSometimes you think you love someone and then you find out you don\u2019t even know them that well and they\u2019re not the prince charming you were hoping for.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd then there are the guys who can\u2019t take no for an answer and keep on pushing and trying and\u2026\u201d She stopped in the middle of her sentence. Her smile had disappeared completely now. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t want to tell you all that, but\u2026\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why I did.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at her for a few seconds and then he reached for her hand and held it between his own palms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that some guys are assholes.\u201d His throat felt a little soar. \u201cYou deserve someone much better.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Sansa\u2019s face slowly returned. \u201cDo you want to know why I really came to your room to get you out of there?\u201d She didn\u2019t give Jon the chance to say something, but he would have said yes anyway. \u201cI&rsquo;ve heard so many stories about you from Robb and I think\u2026\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cI liked the guy he was talking about a lot and somehow\u2026\u201d She locked her glance with his. \u201cIt feels right to be here, with you, without you just talking to me because you wanna kiss or fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt his cheeks heating up and he let her hand go to hid his own hands in the pockets of his jeans. He hadn\u2019t really thought about kissing her, but now he did there was a part of him that wondered how it would feel. </p><p>Would her lips be soft? Would her kiss be slow and gently? Or would it be passionately and filled with fire?</p><p>Sansa placed a hand on his chest while she stepped a little closer towards him. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019d give to find out what you\u2019re thinking right now.\u201d She spoke softly and the tip of her finger traced the vein in his neck that was visibly beating. \u201cTell me something.\u201d</p><p>Jon bit his bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019m somehow all of a sudden realizing that maybe Romeo wasn\u2019t as stupid as I\u2019d always thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Sansa furrowed her eyebrows, but there was a twinkle in her eyes when she kept on looking at him for more.</p><p>\u201cHe did a lot of stupid stuff for a pretty girl and called it love. He knew her for not even an hour or so? But I guess that sometimes you meet someone and you just know that she\u2019s special and different.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI always thought friar Lawrence was more stupid. Who lets two teenagers marry after they know each other for not even a day only because he believed it might stop a century old fight?\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cHe was right in the end. It did stop the fight. But Romeo and Juliette were both dead.\u201d Sansa leaned a little closer towards him. \u201cBut, you have a sudden understanding for this Romeo guy now?\u201d She held her lips close to his ear and now it weren\u2019t just his cheeks anymore heating up. </p><p>His entire face was warm and little pearls of sweat covered his forehead. \u201cSome pretty girls are worth dying for.\u201d Jon eventually replied. \u201cBecause knowing them, talking to them and being with them, even for just a moment, is worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, Jon\u2026\u201d Robb walked into the kitchen and chuckled when Jon and Sansa stepped away from each other as quickly as possible. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know I would interrupt something here. I was wondering where the two of you were, since getting a glass of champagne and something to eat shouldn\u2019t be that hard, but I see you were occupied with other things.\u201d He winked. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re just\u2026\u201d Jon stumbled over his own words and the pearls of sweat now rolled down his temple. </p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;re coming.\u201d Sansa grabbed two glasses and filled them with champagne. \u201cCan you take our glasses for us?\u201d She gave them to Robb and then she reached for Jon\u2019s hand again. </p><p>While Robb walked back to the living room, Sansa pulled Jon no further than the doorframe. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d Jon shook his head, but Sansa pointed up, where a small mistletoe was hanging above their heads. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, Jon. Christmas rules.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at her, at the mistletoe and then back at her. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m afraid so too.\u201d He mumbled and then he leaned towards her and pressed his lips on hers.</p><p>At first the kiss was a little hesitant, a little distant, but then Sansa wrapped her arms around his waist and pressed her body to his.</p><p>A warm and pleasant feeling spread through his body and he buried his hands in her hair while he parted his lips to let her tongue in. He forgot about the rest of the world. He forgot about the other people in the living room. He forgot that he was complaining about this party and wanted to go back to his books.</p><p>There was just him and her.</p><p>And it was the perfect Christmas Eve.</p>",

What was there to say when a beautiful girl spoke words that were nothing but the truth?</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna open that door a little further to come out or are you gonna keep me waiting for the rest of the evening?\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head and all of a sudden he realized he was not really dressed for a Christmas party. \u201cGive me five minutes. I need to change. I wasn\u2019t really planning on seeing anyone today.\u201d He licked his dry lips and then he furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I have something that fits\u2026\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. The red haired girl grabbed his hand and pulled him out of his room. The book he was reading fell on the floor and he quickly grabbed his key before the door locked behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a student party, not a family gathering with your in laws.\u201d She kept on holding onto his hand while she walked to the stairs, as if she was afraid that he\u2019d turn around if she\u2019d let him go. And maybe she was right.</p><p>He would turn around if she\u2019d let his hand go.</p><p>Her high heels echoed through the hallway while they walked down the stairs. When they neared the living room, he could hear the voices, the music and the failing attempts to sing along with the Christmas songs that were playing.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t really want to be here. This was not something he enjoyed. Not even on Christmas Eve. He\u2019d much rather spent his evening in absolute silence, finishing a book or two. At some point he\u2019d maybe order something like pizza, or he\u2019d just look in the fridge to see if anyone had forgotten anything in there. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Robb Stark walked towards him with a glass of champagne in one hand and a big grin on his handsome face. He was wearing a simple black jacket, combined with a white shirt and his jeans, but still he looked like a prince charming, straight out of a fairytale. \u201cI see you met my sister Sansa already?\u201d He nodded at the red haired girl still holding Jon\u2019s hand. \u201cShe\u2019s a noble soul, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled, but he was not sure what to answer. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that in a few hours. Maybe spending Christmas alone isn\u2019t that bad compared to being at a party where you don\u2019t really belong.\u201d</p><p>Robb wrapped an arm around Jon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOf course you belong here! You don\u2019t get our jokes and ruin every lighthearted conversation with something highly deep and intelligent we don\u2019t understand, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t love you. You\u2019re our residential nerd! This house wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Jon wasn\u2019t really sure what to say, but eventually he murmured. \u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Sansa gestured towards the kitchen. \u201cWe should get something to eat and drink.\u201d She led Jon away from the crowd and in the kitchen she finally let his hand go and leaned against the counter. \u201cMy brother never told me you were this handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome?\u201d Jon\u2019s hand went through his hair and he looked around to make sure she had been talking to him and not to anyone else. \u201cYou think I\u2019m handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are!\u201d She raised her voice and placed her hands on his shoulders. \u201cYou really are, Jon.\u201d She nodded once more and her red lips curled up into a bright smile. \u201cI\u2019ve heard loads of stories about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they all came from Robb, I doubt if it were just good things.\u201d Jon smirked and he tucked a loose curl behind his ear. </p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Sansa raised her voice. \u201cHe really likes you, I swear.\u201d Her arms circled around his neck and Jon swallowed. \u201cHe also told me that for good book recommendations, you are the man to go to.\u201d She cocked her head. </p><p>Jon felt a little uncomfortable and he curled his fingers around her wrist. \u201cLook\u2026\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not really the type to just kiss and sleep with a pretty girl only for her to move on in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Sansa widened her eyes and her jaw dropped, but she kept her arms firmly in place. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIs that really what you think I\u2019m doing here? Do you really think I just want to kiss and sleep with you and forget about you in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Jon kept silent, but Sansa looked at him as if she was really expecting him to answer the question. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Jon freed himself from her embrace and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m not that good at flirting and the whole game. I never really know what people want and I just know what I don\u2019t want and\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa pressed a finger to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss much, actually.

His long black curls were messy and he was wearing nothing but a simple jeans and a white shirt. To be honest, he hadn\u2019t really expected anyone.</p><p>After all, it was Christmas Eve and he guessed that most people had better things to do today. Like visiting their family, eating way too much and watching silly Christmas movies they had already seen at least a million times.</p><p>Whoever was knocking on his door however knocked again and with a sigh Jon stood up and walked towards the wooden door.

You should come too.\u201d</p><p>Jon scratched the back of his neck and he swallowed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not really the party kind of type. Ask my dorm mates. I\u2019m the boring astronomy nerd who ruins the fun in every conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just talked to Robb about that and told him to shut up about it.\u201d The girl shrugged and she shifted her weight from one foot to the other. Her legs were long and the black dress she wore barely reached her knees. \u201cNo one should be alone with Christmas.

I need to change. I wasn\u2019t really planning on seeing anyone today.\u201d He licked his dry lips and then he furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I have something that fits\u2026\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. The red haired girl grabbed his hand and pulled him out of his room. The book he was reading fell on the floor and he quickly grabbed his key before the door locked behind him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a student party, not a family gathering with your in laws.\u201d She kept on holding onto his hand while she walked to the stairs, as if she was afraid that he\u2019d turn around if she\u2019d let him go. And maybe she was right.</p><p>He would turn around if she\u2019d let his hand go.</p><p>Her high heels echoed through the hallway while they walked down the stairs. When they neared the living room, he could hear the voices, the music and the failing attempts to sing along with the Christmas songs that were playing.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t really want to be here. This was not something he enjoyed. Not even on Christmas Eve. He\u2019d much rather spent his evening in absolute silence, finishing a book or two. At some point he\u2019d maybe order something like pizza, or he\u2019d just look in the fridge to see if anyone had forgotten anything in there. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Robb Stark walked towards him with a glass of champagne in one hand and a big grin on his handsome face. He was wearing a simple black jacket, combined with a white shirt and his jeans, but still he looked like a prince charming, straight out of a fairytale. \u201cI see you met my sister Sansa already?\u201d He nodded at the red haired girl still holding Jon\u2019s hand. \u201cShe\u2019s a noble soul, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled, but he was not sure what to answer. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that in a few hours. Maybe spending Christmas alone isn\u2019t that bad compared to being at a party where you don\u2019t really belong.\u201d</p><p>Robb wrapped an arm around Jon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOf course you belong here! You don\u2019t get our jokes and ruin every lighthearted conversation with something highly deep and intelligent we don\u2019t understand, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t love you. You\u2019re our residential nerd! This house wouldn\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Jon wasn\u2019t really sure what to say, but eventually he murmured. \u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Sansa gestured towards the kitchen. \u201cWe should get something to eat and drink.\u201d She led Jon away from the crowd and in the kitchen she finally let his hand go and leaned against the counter. \u201cMy brother never told me you were this handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome?\u201d Jon\u2019s hand went through his hair and he looked around to make sure she had been talking to him and not to anyone else. \u201cYou think I\u2019m handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are!\u201d She raised her voice and placed her hands on his shoulders. \u201cYou really are, Jon.\u201d She nodded once more and her red lips curled up into a bright smile. \u201cI\u2019ve heard loads of stories about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they all came from Robb, I doubt if it were just good things.\u201d Jon smirked and he tucked a loose curl behind his ear. </p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Sansa raised her voice. \u201cHe really likes you, I swear.\u201d Her arms circled around his neck and Jon swallowed. \u201cHe also told me that for good book recommendations, you are the man to go to.\u201d She cocked her head. </p><p>Jon felt a little uncomfortable and he curled his fingers around her wrist. \u201cLook\u2026\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not really the type to just kiss and sleep with a pretty girl only for her to move on in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Sansa widened her eyes and her jaw dropped, but she kept her arms firmly in place. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIs that really what you think I\u2019m doing here? Do you really think I just want to kiss and sleep with you and forget about you in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Jon kept silent, but Sansa looked at him as if she was really expecting him to answer the question. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Jon freed himself from her embrace and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m not that good at flirting and the whole game. I never really know what people want and I just know what I don\u2019t want and\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa pressed a finger to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss much, actually. Mostly the game ends in utter disappointment anyway.\u201d She pulled her finger back and the smile on her face faded a little. \u201cSometimes you think you love someone and then you find out you don\u2019t even know them that well and they\u2019re not the prince charming you were hoping for.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd then there are the guys who can\u2019t take no for an answer and keep on pushing and trying and\u2026\u201d She stopped in the middle of her sentence. Her smile had disappeared completely now. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t want to tell you all that, but\u2026\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why I did.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at her for a few seconds and then he reached for her hand and held it between his own palms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that some guys are assholes.\u201d His throat felt a little soar. \u201cYou deserve someone much better.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Sansa\u2019s face slowly returned. \u201cDo you want to know why I really came to your room to get you out of there?\u201d She didn\u2019t give Jon the chance to say something, but he would have said yes anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so many stories about you from Robb and I think\u2026\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cI liked the guy he was talking about a lot and somehow\u2026\u201d She locked her glance with his. \u201cIt feels right to be here, with you, without you just talking to me because you wanna kiss or fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt his cheeks heating up and he let her hand go to hid his own hands in the pockets of his jeans. He hadn\u2019t really thought about kissing her, but now he did there was a part of him that wondered how it would feel. </p><p>Would her lips be soft? Would her kiss be slow and gently? Or would it be passionately and filled with fire?</p><p>Sansa placed a hand on his chest while she stepped a little closer towards him. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019d give to find out what you\u2019re thinking right now.\u201d She spoke softly and the tip of her finger traced the vein in his neck that was visibly beating. \u201cTell me something.\u201d</p><p>Jon bit his bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019m somehow all of a sudden realizing that maybe Romeo wasn\u2019t as stupid as I\u2019d always thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Sansa furrowed her eyebrows, but there was a twinkle in her eyes when she kept on looking at him for more.</p><p>\u201cHe did a lot of stupid stuff for a pretty girl and called it love. He knew her for not even an hour or so? But I guess that sometimes you meet someone and you just know that she\u2019s special and different.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI always thought friar Lawrence was more stupid. Who lets two teenagers marry after they know each other for not even a day only because he believed it might stop a century old fight?\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cHe was right in the end. It did stop the fight. But Romeo and Juliette were both dead.\u201d Sansa leaned a little closer towards him. \u201cBut, you have a sudden understanding for this Romeo guy now?\u201d She held her lips close to his ear and now it weren\u2019t just his cheeks anymore heating up. </p><p>His entire face was warm and little pearls of sweat covered his forehead. \u201cSome pretty girls are worth dying for.\u201d Jon eventually replied. \u201cBecause knowing them, talking to them and being with them, even for just a moment, is worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa, Jon\u2026\u201d Robb walked into the kitchen and chuckled when Jon and Sansa stepped away from each other as quickly as possible. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know I would interrupt something here. I was wondering where the two of you were, since getting a glass of champagne and something to eat shouldn\u2019t be that hard, but I see you were occupied with other things.\u201d He winked. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re just\u2026\u201d Jon stumbled over his own words and the pearls of sweat now rolled down his temple. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming.\u201d Sansa grabbed two glasses and filled them with champagne. \u201cCan you take our glasses for us?\u201d She gave them to Robb and then she reached for Jon\u2019s hand again. </p><p>While Robb walked back to the living room, Sansa pulled Jon no further than the doorframe. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d Jon shook his head, but Sansa pointed up, where a small mistletoe was hanging above their heads. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jon. Christmas rules.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at her, at the mistletoe and then back at her. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m afraid so too.\u201d He mumbled and then he leaned towards her and pressed his lips on hers.</p><p>At first the kiss was a little hesitant, a little distant, but then Sansa wrapped her arms around his waist and pressed her body to his.</p><p>A warm and pleasant feeling spread through his body and he buried his hands in her hair while he parted his lips to let her tongue in. He forgot about the rest of the world. He forgot about the other people in the living room. He forgot that he was complaining about this party and wanted to go back to his books.</p><p>There was just him and her.</p><p>And it was the perfect Christmas Eve.</p></p>",

His long black curls were messy and he was wearing nothing but a simple jeans and a white shirt. To be honest, he hadn&rsquo;t really expected anyone.</p>\n<p>After all, it was Christmas Eve and he guessed that most people had better things to do today. Like visiting their family, eating way too much and watching silly Christmas movies they had already seen at least a million times.</p>\n<p>Whoever was knocking on his door however knocked again and with a sigh Jon stood up and walked towards the wooden door. He was still holding his book when he opened the door only a little bit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jon Snow.&rdquo; A beautiful red head smiled at him and for a moment Jon could just stare.</p>\n<p>It was only after a couple of very long seconds that he realized he&rsquo;d have to say something. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s me?&rdquo; He cocked his head and the beautiful red head raised her eyebrows and crossed her arms over her chest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What are you doing all alone in your room on Christmas Eve?&rdquo; She lifted her chin a little and Jon realized he had to look up to look her in the eyes. &ldquo;The entire house is having a party downstairs in the living room. You should come too.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon scratched the back of his neck and he swallowed. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not really the party kind of type. Ask my dorm mates. I&rsquo;m the boring astronomy nerd who ruins the fun in every conversation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just talked to Robb about that and told him to shut up about it.&rdquo; The girl shrugged and she shifted her weight from one foot to the other. Her legs were long and the black dress she wore barely reached her knees. &ldquo;No one should be alone with Christmas. And don&rsquo;t tell me that your books and stars are all the company you need, because that&rsquo;s bullshit and you know it.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
