Around the room everyone else perks up at the sight of the box. \r</p><p>\u201cWell I thought it was customary to celebrate birthdays with a cake right?\u201d Grin getting wider, Bucky places the box on the table with a flourish. It took so much self restraint to not rub his hands together at the sigh of everyone\u2019s confused expressions. \r</p><p>\u201cToday is Paul Ramos\u2019s birthday, a small guy from queens!\u201d Taking the top of the box, Bucky reveals an eagle themed birthday cake, on it on a banner clutched in the claws is the words \u2018happy birthday Paul Ramos!\u2019. \r</p><p>Confused, stunned silence fell as everyone stared a the cake, trying to work out what was happening. It was actually broken by Tony first who practically doubled over, forehead hitting the table as he started to giggle hard. \r</p><p>\u201cOh god!

Placing his tablet to the side for a moment, Bucky snatches up his journal in his bedside cabinet. Flipping through he finds the page he needs and checks the date in the corner of the tablet. Smirking, pleased at what he sees, Bucky calls out to Friday. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Friday? Think you can direct me to the nearest cake store?\u201d \r</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r</p><p>\u201cHey guys, any idea why Bucky asked us all to wait in the kitchen?\u201d Steve questioned as he took a seat at the kitchen table, fresh from the shower and showing no signs of having just been for a run. Sam still panting is glaring daggers across the table at him muttering under his breathe. \r</p><p>\u201cAh great you\u2019re all here!\u201d Bucky finally arrives last, hair up in a messy bun to keep it out of his eyes allowing them all to see his shark like grin. In his arms is a massive box, it look like a confectionary box. \r</p><p>\u201cEr, Buck, babe- what\u2019s in the box?\u201d Now curious, Steve turns to give Bucky his entire attention. Around the room everyone else perks up at the sight of the box. \r</p><p>\u201cWell I thought it was customary to celebrate birthdays with a cake right?\u201d Grin getting wider, Bucky places the box on the table with a flourish. It took so much self restraint to not rub his hands together at the sigh of everyone\u2019s confused expressions. \r</p><p>\u201cToday is Paul Ramos\u2019s birthday, a small guy from queens!\u201d Taking the top of the box, Bucky reveals an eagle themed birthday cake, on it on a banner clutched in the claws is the words \u2018happy birthday Paul Ramos!\u2019. \r</p><p>Confused, stunned silence fell as everyone stared a the cake, trying to work out what was happening. It was actually broken by Tony first who practically doubled over, forehead hitting the table as he started to giggle hard. \r</p><p>\u201cOh god! I can\u2019t believe you remembered that!\u201d Face red from the force of his laughter that Tony was failing to smother, Tony looked up at Steve expectantly. \u201cTell me you recognise that name?\u201d \r</p><p>It took a few moments for the name to click, Bucky could tell when it did as Steve started to sink down in his seat, doing a very good impression of a melting ice-lollie in the middle of summer. The explanation for the others just added more hilarity to the situation much to Bucky\u2019s amusement, Clint and Sam going so far as to refer to Steve as Paul for the rest of the day. \r</p><p>The pranks didn\u2019t end there, each date that Bucky had written in his journal he shared with the others, setting up surprise parties for each of Steve\u2019s alias to throw for him. Tony took delight in helping to plan each and every party, shoving cake in Steve\u2019s face occasionally and getting cake in return down the back of his shirt. \r</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously remember each one?!\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cOh yes, they were the first things I did recall fully after I got my mind back, this is payback for making me recall such stress inducing memories punk\u201d \r</p><p>Bucky also confronted Tony as to how he realised so quickly the first time.\r</p><p>\u201cMy dad got ahold of the records of all of Steve\u2019s attempted enlistments, of course I came across them and found it hilarious the captain good and righteous was actually a lier. My dad tried to make it sound like cap was honest and sin free, nauseating know,\u201d \r</p>",

He remembers the worrying he did over the little punk. Praying that he wasn&rsquo;t caught and punished for lying on the enlistment forms which was illegal. \r</p><p>So the moment he was given the all clear from Shuri that the Winter Soldier was no longer controllable via triggers, Bucky focused on trying to regain some memories and wrote them all down. The fact that one of the first memories he had was of Steve&rsquo;s many alter egos during the war, just pissed him off. Why couldn&rsquo;t he recall some random hookup and have a happy first memory?

You coughed, spits of water finally making their way out of your lungs. You were shuddering. It was so so cold and heavy droplets of rain made it even worse. You tried to pick yourself up from the ground. There was mud all around you, it was sticking to your clothes, your hair, everything, and it made it so hard to move your already tired and aching muscles. You had to gather all the strength you had, to pick yourself up to a kneeling position. You looked around you. There were only dirty gray buildings behind you and ahead of you&hellip; nothing but dirty water. You had no idea where you were. </p><p>Hot tears of betrayal started pouring, quietly down your face. You were angry, no, you were more than just angry, you were furious. How could she do this to you?!</p><p>Your anger seemed to have sparked something in you because before you even knew it, you were on your feet, shouting at the sky. \u00bbHow could you?! How could you?!\u00ab You grabbed a handful of mud and threw it in the air. \u00bbI hate you! How dare you do this to me?! I hate you!\u00ab You were crying and screaming at the top of your lungs, both at the same time, hoping that someone would hear you, but all you got back was an echo of your exasperated cries.</p><p>You sobbed, hugging yourself for reassurance. What to do now? What does one possibly do in this situation? You started walking, your feet heavy. You didn&rsquo;t know where was it, that you were headed, nor did you care, you just wanted to forget, you wanted to forget what just happened, you wanted to forget the pain, the betrayal and the injustice, you wanted it all gone.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i></p><p>\u00bbPrinsessan m\u00edn (my princess), \u00a0your mother is asking to see you.\u00ab A young woman in a beautiful, long, turquoise, column dress, entered the room. Her gown was made fully out of the finest charmeuse silk, decorated with precious stones tenderly sewed onto the dress.</p><p>\u00bbThank you Mard\u01ebll, tell her I&rsquo;ll be coming in a minute.\u00ab You answered, somewhat startled by her sudden appearance. </p><p>Mard\u01ebll was the protector of the Antares&rsquo;s seas and also, one of the most loyal, royal warriors. You&rsquo;ve known her ever since you were born and yet you still weren&rsquo;t used of her unusual and unique appearance. </p><p>She was beautiful, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, her skin was a rich taupe; grey, with a tinge of brown, she always had her citrine coloured hair in a curly updo and her walnut brown eyes always carried a certain special light in them. However there was something about the way she moved, that made chills run down your spine. No matter what you did, you could never hear her coming. She was quieter than a mouse. Her steps were always light and her movements slick, whether she was dancing, or fighting with a sword. \u00a0You were pretty sure you had never seen anyone more graceful than her. </p><p>You stood up, heading to the living quarters, where your mum was probably, already impatiently waiting for you. You walked through the empty halls, each of the halls resembling a different part of Antares&rsquo;s history. There was the great battle with Asgardians, then the signing of a treaty with the J\u00f6tnar, the attack of the titans, the coronation of your mother and so on and so on.</p><p>At last, you entered the room where your mother was. She was sitting on a sofa, reading a letter. There was a slight sign of a wrinkle between her eyebrows and it made you wonder what was it that she read that made her worried.</p><p>\u00bbYou requested upon my presence m\u00f3\u00f0ir (mother).\u00ab You said and bowed.</p><p>Now, usually, your mum would smile or snort at your silly sarcasm, however, right now, all she did was give you a sad sigh.</p><p>\u00bbMum? What&rsquo;s wrong?\u00ab You asked, taking a step closer to her.</p><p>Your mum frowned. \u00bbYou need to leave.\u00ab She muttered.</p><p>\u00bbExcuse me?!\u00ab You retorted, incredulously.</p><p>A heavy sigh left her lips. \u00bbYou need to leave Antares and you need to leave it as soon as possible.\u00ab She stated with, what could only be described as a slight tremble in her voice.</p><p>\u00bbBut why? What&rsquo;s going on?!\u00ab You nearly cried.</p><p>\u00bbIt is for your own good Y/N, trust me.\u00ab She tried to take a hold of your hands, her voice exasperated.</p><p>\u00bbWhat do you mean my own good? What on Antares is going on with you?\u00ab You were now almost yelling, stepping away from her.</p><p>\u00bbI&hellip; I can&rsquo;t tell you, I am sorry.\u00ab She whispered bitterly, looking down.</p><p>\u00bbWhat do you mean you can&rsquo;t tell me?! I am your daughter for god&rsquo;s sake, you can&rsquo;t just sent me away without a reason.\u00ab You continued to yell, your voice getting higher and higher.</p><p>\u00bbI have a reason! I need to protect you and the only way to do it is, as much as I hate it, to send you away.\u00ab Tears started dwelling up in her eyes.</p><p>\u00bbProtect me from what? Mum please, please tell me what is happening right now! I don&rsquo;t understand! I don&rsquo;t want to leave!\u00ab You wept.</p><p>\u00bbY/N, please don&rsquo;t make this harder for me than it already is, it is safer for you, if you don&rsquo;t know.\u00ab She pleaded.</p><p>She raised her hand, her fingers starting to glow in a soft purplish colour.</p><p>\u00bbPlease don&rsquo;t!\u00ab You sobbed.</p><p>\u00bbI am so sorry.\u00ab You mum was now crying, her tears glistening in the soft luminous of the light she just created with her hands.</p><p>The last thing you remembered was a feeling of warmth on your forehead before everything went black.</p><p><i><b>END OF FLASHBACK</b></i></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p>Peter was going on his every day night patrol, expecting to see some petty street crimes or some lost drunken teenagers or something, however, he had never imagined to see someone quite like that. She was so&hellip; unusual. Her hair was sticky with mud, her damp clothes clung onto her body uncomfortably. And what was she wearing anyways? It was a silver-looking, trumpet shaped organza dress, that showed a fair amount of the girl&rsquo;s cleavage. </p><p>He neared her carefully, something about her appearance just didn&rsquo;t seem of this world. </p><p>He coughed. \u00bbhey, you okay there?\u00ab</p><p>She gasped, clearly frightened by his sudden presence. </p><p>\u00bbHver ertu?\u00ab She outed, her voice demanding, her eyes untrusting.</p><p>\u00bbI&hellip; I am sorry, I don&rsquo;t understand.\u00ab Peter stuttered, trying to sound reassuring, but failing.</p><p>Her eyes widened slightly, she took a deep breath. \u00bbWho&hellip; who are you?\u00ab She gulped.</p><p>She was barely holding up her posture, and before Peter was even able to answer, her body gave in.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0<b><i>STARK TOWER</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p>\u00bbMr. Stark, Mr. Stark, please, help!\u00ab Peter entered the main quarters of the Stark tower, carrying a girl.</p><p>\u00bbJesus kid, what happened?\u00ab Tony&rsquo;s voice was concerned.</p><p>\u00bbI don&rsquo;t know, I found her walking down the river shore.\u00ab Peter&rsquo;s voice was a few frequencies higher than normal.</p><p>\u00bbDo you know who she is or where she came from?\u00ab Bruce chimed in, stepping closer to take a look at the girl.</p><p>\u00bbNo, she collapsed before I even managed to find out her name.\u00ab Peter answered, his eyes never leaving her.</p><p>\u00bbHer body temperature is way too low, we need to take her to the ER and warm her up.\u00ab Bruce lifted her body gently, taking her to the tower&rsquo;s emergency room. </p><p>\u00bbDo you think she&rsquo;s going to be okay?\u00ab Peter asked, looking up at Tony.</p><p>\u00bbI don&rsquo;t know kid, I don&rsquo;t know.\u00ab</p><p><i><b>TIME SKIP</b></i></p><p>It has been three days, since Peter brought you to the tower and yet, you still hadn&rsquo;t woken up and still, nobody knew where you came from.

The image of your young self and your father disheveled in front of you and all you could hear was loud and fast beeping. The beeping wouldn&rsquo;t stop, it just kept lasting and lasting and it got louder and louder, every now and then, you could hear a male voice going \u00bbis she alright, what&rsquo;s happening?\u00ab. Then out of nowhere, everything went silent, the last thing you remember hearing was a harsh whisper hissing out your name.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Once again, you woke up with a gasp and once again, you had absolutely no idea where you were. You looked around, finally \u00a0noticing two, horrified looking faces. Looking at the young one, everything came rushing back to you; your mother sending you away, the dirty shore you first woke up on, the boy in the red mask that somewhat reminded you of the one standing in front of you, everything. </p><p>You rubbed your temples, trying hard to swallow the tears that were gathering at the back of your eyes. </p><p>A voice cut through the room. \u00bbMs, can you understand us? Can you tell us who you are?\u00ab The older of the two men in your room took a step closer. </p><p>You cleared your throat. \u00bbMy name is Y/N, I am of a place called Antares and I am a daughter of Asedrotting and Trygvekonungur.\u00ab</p><p>Both of them looked at you, confused as the have probably never been before in their lives. \u00bbRight&hellip; Y/N can you tell us how you got here or why?\u00ab Bruce continued to question you.</p><p>His words made you feel like a shrapnel just hit your chest, when you remembered the warm purple light your mum used to send you here.</p><p>You sighed, holding your tears back once more. \u00bbI was sent here by my mother to be protected.\u00ab</p><p>\u00bbProtected?

The whole scene was disconcerting to watch. </p><p>One of the men witnessing the unfold, stepped closer to the fog and raised his hand in order to touch it. His hand barely grazed the dark substance, when a painful scream erupted from his lungs. First, his palm turned black and then this same blackness started spreading through his veins, turning his entire body into ashes. </p><p>The crowd stood in fear like statues. </p><p>A loud screech echoed through the abyss. It was getting louder and louder by seconds and soon a growling creature rose up from the fog surrounding it. It was a wyvern, it&rsquo;s mighty wings were covered with silver scales and its skin was like one of a snake, coloured in bloodred. </p><p>\u00bbNi\u00f0ur!

You coughed, spits of water finally making their way out of your lungs. You were shuddering. It was so so cold and heavy droplets of rain made it even worse. You tried to pick yourself up from the ground. There was mud all around you, it was sticking to your clothes, your hair, everything, and it made it so hard to move your already tired and aching muscles. You had to gather all the strength you had, to pick yourself up to a kneeling position. You looked around you. There were only dirty gray buildings behind you and ahead of you\u2026 nothing but dirty water. You had no idea where you were. </p><p>Hot tears of betrayal started pouring, quietly down your face. You were angry, no, you were more than just angry, you were furious. How could she do this to you?!</p><p>Your anger seemed to have sparked something in you because before you even knew it, you were on your feet, shouting at the sky. \u00bbHow could you?! How could you?!\u00ab You grabbed a handful of mud and threw it in the air. \u00bbI hate you! How dare you do this to me?! I hate you!\u00ab You were crying and screaming at the top of your lungs, both at the same time, hoping that someone would hear you, but all you got back was an echo of your exasperated cries.</p><p>You sobbed, hugging yourself for reassurance. What to do now? What does one possibly do in this situation? You started walking, your feet heavy. You didn\u2019t know where was it, that you were headed, nor did you care, you just wanted to forget, you wanted to forget what just happened, you wanted to forget the pain, the betrayal and the injustice, you wanted it all gone.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i></p><p>\u00bbPrinsessan m\u00edn (my princess), \u00a0your mother is asking to see you.\u00ab A young woman in a beautiful, long, turquoise, column dress, entered the room. Her gown was made fully out of the finest charmeuse silk, decorated with precious stones tenderly sewed onto the dress.</p><p>\u00bbThank you Mard\u01ebll, tell her I\u2019ll be coming in a minute.\u00ab You answered, somewhat startled by her sudden appearance. </p><p>Mard\u01ebll was the protector of the Antares\u2019s seas and also, one of the most loyal, royal warriors. You\u2019ve known her ever since you were born and yet you still weren\u2019t used of her unusual and unique appearance. </p><p>She was beautiful, there\u2019s no doubt about it, her skin was a rich taupe; grey, with a tinge of brown, she always had her citrine coloured hair in a curly updo and her walnut brown eyes always carried a certain special light in them. However there was something about the way she moved, that made chills run down your spine. No matter what you did, you could never hear her coming. She was quieter than a mouse. Her steps were always light and her movements slick, whether she was dancing, or fighting with a sword. \u00a0You were pretty sure you had never seen anyone more graceful than her. </p><p>You stood up, heading to the living quarters, where your mum was probably, already impatiently waiting for you. You walked through the empty halls, each of the halls resembling a different part of Antares\u2019s history. There was the great battle with Asgardians, then the signing of a treaty with the J\u00f6tnar, the attack of the titans, the coronation of your mother and so on and so on.</p><p>At last, you entered the room where your mother was. She was sitting on a sofa, reading a letter. There was a slight sign of a wrinkle between her eyebrows and it made you wonder what was it that she read that made her worried.</p><p>\u00bbYou requested upon my presence m\u00f3\u00f0ir (mother).\u00ab You said and bowed.</p><p>Now, usually, your mum would smile or snort at your silly sarcasm, however, right now, all she did was give you a sad sigh.</p><p>\u00bbMum? What\u2019s wrong?\u00ab You asked, taking a step closer to her.</p><p>Your mum frowned. \u00bbYou need to leave.\u00ab She muttered.</p><p>\u00bbExcuse me?!\u00ab You retorted, incredulously.</p><p>A heavy sigh left her lips. \u00bbYou need to leave Antares and you need to leave it as soon as possible.\u00ab She stated with, what could only be described as a slight tremble in her voice.</p><p>\u00bbBut why? What\u2019s going on?!\u00ab You nearly cried.</p><p>\u00bbIt is for your own good Y/N, trust me.\u00ab She tried to take a hold of your hands, her voice exasperated.</p><p>\u00bbWhat do you mean my own good? What on Antares is going on with you?\u00ab You were now almost yelling, stepping away from her.</p><p>\u00bbI\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you, I am sorry.\u00ab She whispered bitterly, looking down.</p><p>\u00bbWhat do you mean you can\u2019t tell me?! I am your daughter for god\u2019s sake, you can\u2019t just sent me away without a reason.\u00ab You continued to yell, your voice getting higher and higher.</p><p>\u00bbI have a reason! I need to protect you and the only way to do it is, as much as I hate it, to send you away.\u00ab Tears started dwelling up in her eyes.</p><p>\u00bbProtect me from what? Mum please, please tell me what is happening right now! I don\u2019t understand! I don\u2019t want to leave!\u00ab You wept.</p><p>\u00bbY/N, please don\u2019t make this harder for me than it already is, it is safer for you, if you don\u2019t know.\u00ab She pleaded.</p><p>She raised her hand, her fingers starting to glow in a soft purplish colour.</p><p>\u00bbPlease don\u2019t!\u00ab You sobbed.</p><p>\u00bbI am so sorry.\u00ab You mum was now crying, her tears glistening in the soft luminous of the light she just created with her hands.</p><p>The last thing you remembered was a feeling of warmth on your forehead before everything went black.</p><p><i><b>END OF FLASHBACK</b></i></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>Peter was going on his every day night patrol, expecting to see some petty street crimes or some lost drunken teenagers or something, however, he had never imagined to see someone quite like that. She was so\u2026 unusual. Her hair was sticky with mud, her damp clothes clung onto her body uncomfortably. And what was she wearing anyways? It was a silver-looking, trumpet shaped organza dress, that showed a fair amount of the girl\u2019s cleavage. </p><p>He neared her carefully, something about her appearance just didn\u2019t seem of this world. </p><p>He coughed. \u00bbhey, you okay there?\u00ab</p><p>She gasped, clearly frightened by his sudden presence. </p><p>\u00bbHver ertu?\u00ab She outed, her voice demanding, her eyes untrusting.</p><p>\u00bbI\u2026 I am sorry, I don\u2019t understand.\u00ab Peter stuttered, trying to sound reassuring, but failing.</p><p>Her eyes widened slightly, she took a deep breath. \u00bbWho\u2026 who are you?\u00ab She gulped.</p><p>She was barely holding up her posture, and before Peter was even able to answer, her body gave in.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0<b><i>STARK TOWER</i></b></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>\u00bbMr. Stark, Mr. Stark, please, help!\u00ab Peter entered the main quarters of the Stark tower, carrying a girl.</p><p>\u00bbJesus kid, what happened?\u00ab Tony\u2019s voice was concerned.</p><p>\u00bbI don\u2019t know, I found her walking down the river shore.\u00ab Peter\u2019s voice was a few frequencies higher than normal.</p><p>\u00bbDo you know who she is or where she came from?\u00ab Bruce chimed in, stepping closer to take a look at the girl.</p><p>\u00bbNo, she collapsed before I even managed to find out her name.\u00ab Peter answered, his eyes never leaving her.</p><p>\u00bbHer body temperature is way too low, we need to take her to the ER and warm her up.\u00ab Bruce lifted her body gently, taking her to the tower\u2019s emergency room. </p><p>\u00bbDo you think she\u2019s going to be okay?\u00ab Peter asked, looking up at Tony.</p><p>\u00bbI don\u2019t know kid, I don\u2019t know.\u00ab</p><p><i><b>TIME SKIP</b></i></p><p>It has been three days, since Peter brought you to the tower and yet, you still hadn\u2019t woken up and still, nobody knew where you came from.

You tried to pick yourself up from the ground. There was mud all around you, it was sticking to your clothes, your hair, everything, and it made it so hard to move your already tired and aching muscles. You had to gather all the strength you had, to pick yourself up to a kneeling position. You looked around you. There were only dirty gray buildings behind you and ahead of you\u2026 nothing but dirty water. You had no idea where you were. </p><p>Hot tears of betrayal started pouring, quietly down your face.

What to do now? What does one possibly do in this situation? You started walking, your feet heavy. You didn\u2019t know where was it, that you were headed, nor did you care, you just wanted to forget, you wanted to forget what just happened, you wanted to forget the pain, the betrayal and the injustice, you wanted it all gone.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><i><b>FLASHBACK</b></i></p><p>\u00bbPrinsessan m\u00edn (my princess), \u00a0your mother is asking to see you.\u00ab A young woman in a beautiful, long, turquoise, column dress, entered the room. Her gown was made fully out of the finest charmeuse silk, decorated with precious stones tenderly sewed onto the dress.</p><p>\u00bbThank you Mard\u01ebll, tell her I\u2019ll be coming in a minute.\u00ab You answered, somewhat startled by her sudden appearance. </p><p>Mard\u01ebll was the protector of the Antares\u2019s seas and also, one of the most loyal, royal warriors. You\u2019ve known her ever since you were born and yet you still weren\u2019t used of her unusual and unique appearance. </p><p>She was beautiful, there\u2019s no doubt about it, her skin was a rich taupe; grey, with a tinge of brown, she always had her citrine coloured hair in a curly updo and her walnut brown eyes always carried a certain special light in them. However there was something about the way she moved, that made chills run down your spine. No matter what you did, you could never hear her coming. She was quieter than a mouse. Her steps were always light and her movements slick, whether she was dancing, or fighting with a sword. \u00a0You were pretty sure you had never seen anyone more graceful than her. </p><p>You stood up, heading to the living quarters, where your mum was probably, already impatiently waiting for you. You walked through the empty halls, each of the halls resembling a different part of Antares\u2019s history. There was the great battle with Asgardians, then the signing of a treaty with the J\u00f6tnar, the attack of the titans, the coronation of your mother and so on and so on.</p><p>At last, you entered the room where your mother was. She was sitting on a sofa, reading a letter. There was a slight sign of a wrinkle between her eyebrows and it made you wonder what was it that she read that made her worried.</p><p>\u00bbYou requested upon my presence m\u00f3\u00f0ir (mother).\u00ab You said and bowed.</p><p>Now, usually, your mum would smile or snort at your silly sarcasm, however, right now, all she did was give you a sad sigh.</p><p>\u00bbMum? What\u2019s wrong?\u00ab You asked, taking a step closer to her.</p><p>Your mum frowned. \u00bbYou need to leave.\u00ab She muttered.</p><p>\u00bbExcuse me?!\u00ab You retorted, incredulously.</p><p>A heavy sigh left her lips. \u00bbYou need to leave Antares and you need to leave it as soon as possible.\u00ab She stated with, what could only be described as a slight tremble in her voice.</p><p>\u00bbBut why? What\u2019s going on?!\u00ab You nearly cried.</p><p>\u00bbIt is for your own good Y/N, trust me.\u00ab She tried to take a hold of your hands, her voice exasperated.</p><p>\u00bbWhat do you mean my own good? What on Antares is going on with you?\u00ab You were now almost yelling, stepping away from her.</p><p>\u00bbI\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you, I am sorry.\u00ab She whispered bitterly, looking down.</p><p>\u00bbWhat do you mean you can\u2019t tell me?!

I don\u2019t want to leave!\u00ab You wept.</p><p>\u00bbY/N, please don\u2019t make this harder for me than it already is, it is safer for you, if you don\u2019t know.\u00ab She pleaded.</p><p>She raised her hand, her fingers starting to glow in a soft purplish colour.</p><p>\u00bbPlease don\u2019t!\u00ab You sobbed.</p><p>\u00bbI am so sorry.\u00ab You mum was now crying, her tears glistening in the soft luminous of the light she just created with her hands.</p><p>The last thing you remembered was a feeling of warmth on your forehead before everything went black.</p><p><i><b>END OF FLASHBACK</b></i></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>Peter was going on his every day night patrol, expecting to see some petty street crimes or some lost drunken teenagers or something, however, he had never imagined to see someone quite like that. She was so\u2026 unusual. Her hair was sticky with mud, her damp clothes clung onto her body uncomfortably. And what was she wearing anyways? It was a silver-looking, trumpet shaped organza dress, that showed a fair amount of the girl\u2019s cleavage. </p><p>He neared her carefully, something about her appearance just didn\u2019t seem of this world. </p><p>He coughed. \u00bbhey, you okay there?\u00ab</p><p>She gasped, clearly frightened by his sudden presence. </p><p>\u00bbHver ertu?\u00ab She outed, her voice demanding, her eyes untrusting.</p><p>\u00bbI\u2026 I am sorry, I don\u2019t understand.\u00ab Peter stuttered, trying to sound reassuring, but failing.</p><p>Her eyes widened slightly, she took a deep breath. \u00bbWho\u2026 who are you?\u00ab She gulped.</p><p>She was barely holding up her posture, and before Peter was even able to answer, her body gave in.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0<b><i>STARK TOWER</i></b></p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p>\u00bbMr. Stark, Mr. Stark, please, help!\u00ab Peter entered the main quarters of the Stark tower, carrying a girl.</p><p>\u00bbJesus kid, what happened?\u00ab Tony\u2019s voice was concerned.</p><p>\u00bbI don\u2019t know, I found her walking down the river shore.\u00ab Peter\u2019s voice was a few frequencies higher than normal.</p><p>\u00bbDo you know who she is or where she came from?\u00ab Bruce chimed in, stepping closer to take a look at the girl.</p><p>\u00bbNo, she collapsed before I even managed to find out her name.\u00ab Peter answered, his eyes never leaving her.</p><p>\u00bbHer body temperature is way too low, we need to take her to the ER and warm her up.\u00ab Bruce lifted her body gently, taking her to the tower\u2019s emergency room. </p><p>\u00bbDo you think she\u2019s going to be okay?\u00ab Peter asked, looking up at Tony.</p><p>\u00bbI don\u2019t know kid, I don\u2019t know.\u00ab</p><p><i><b>TIME SKIP</b></i></p><p>It has been three days, since Peter brought you to the tower and yet, you still hadn\u2019t woken up and still, nobody knew where you came from. You had nothing on you, when you were brought in, no phone, no wallet, nothing, all everyone could do was wait and guess.</p><p>\u00bbWas I too late?\u00ab Peter asked, looking through you hospital room\u2019s window, his eyes fixed on you.</p><p>\u00bbNo, I don\u2019t think so, I just think she must\u2019ve gone through something very serious and her body needs some time to recover\u2026\u00ab just as he was about to continue, your heart monitor started beeping maniacally. </p><p>You were dreaming, you knew it was a dream because you were looking yourself from a third person\u2019s view. Your subconsciousness took you back to the time where you were little. You saw your three year old self, holding your father\u2019s hand, looking up at the frescoes. </p><p>\u00bbDad?\u00ab Your voice came out as if it was muffled by water.</p><p>\u00bbYes my dear?\u00ab Your father smiled down at you.</p><p>\u00bbWho\u2019s that?\u00ab You pointed at a fresco of a woman in black, her hair covering most of her facial features. </p><p>You looked at the picture closely, then suddenly, her head tilted up, uncovering her completely white eyes and her lips, forming into an evil grin. </p><p>You screamed. The image of your young self and your father disheveled in front of you and all you could hear was loud and fast beeping. The beeping wouldn\u2019t stop, it just kept lasting and lasting and it got louder and louder, every now and then, you could hear a male voice going \u00bbis she alright, what\u2019s happening?\u00ab. Then out of nowhere, everything went silent, the last thing you remember hearing was a harsh whisper hissing out your name.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Once again, you woke up with a gasp and once again, you had absolutely no idea where you were. You looked around, finally \u00a0noticing two, horrified looking faces. Looking at the young one, everything came rushing back to you; your mother sending you away, the dirty shore you first woke up on, the boy in the red mask that somewhat reminded you of the one standing in front of you, everything. </p><p>You rubbed your temples, trying hard to swallow the tears that were gathering at the back of your eyes. </p><p>A voice cut through the room. \u00bbMs, can you understand us? Can you tell us who you are?\u00ab The older of the two men in your room took a step closer. </p><p>You cleared your throat. \u00bbMy name is Y/N, I am of a place called Antares and I am a daughter of Asedrotting and Trygvekonungur.\u00ab</p><p>Both of them looked at you, confused as the have probably never been before in their lives. \u00bbRight\u2026 Y/N can you tell us how you got here or why?\u00ab Bruce continued to question you.</p><p>His words made you feel like a shrapnel just hit your chest, when you remembered the warm purple light your mum used to send you here.</p><p>You sighed, holding your tears back once more. \u00bbI was sent here by my mother to be protected.\u00ab</p><p>\u00bbProtected? Protected from what?!\u00ab</p><p>\u00a0<i><b>ANTARES</b></i></p><p>\u00bbMard\u01ebll, hvernig l\u00edtur \u00fea\u00f0 \u00fat? (how\u2019s it looking?)\u00ab Ase asked, fear glimmering in her eyes.</p><p>\u00bb\u00fea\u00f0 er a\u00f0 koma, drottningin m\u00edn (she\u2019s coming, my queen).\u00ab The warrior bowed her head.</p><p>Before Ase even managed to continue her sentence, a loud clash was heard coming from the outside of the castle.</p><p>The ground began to shake, enormous flocks of ravens started circling the sky, letting out their unnerving caws. Out of the blue, a crack began to spread across the place, it was getting wider and wider and it soon formed a huge gap. </p><p>Antaris that were gathered outside were scared, none of them knew what was going on, something seemed to be coming for them and nobody knew what it was.</p><p>Black fog started coming from the gap that formed just seconds ago, it was twisting in unnatural shapes and it had this horrible, unwelcoming scent of something dead. The whole scene was disconcerting to watch. </p><p>One of the men witnessing the unfold, stepped closer to the fog and raised his hand in order to touch it. His hand barely grazed the dark substance, when a painful scream erupted from his lungs. First, his palm turned black and then this same blackness started spreading through his veins, turning his entire body into ashes. </p><p>The crowd stood in fear like statues. </p><p>A loud screech echoed through the abyss. It was getting louder and louder by seconds and soon a growling creature rose up from the fog surrounding it. It was a wyvern, it\u2019s mighty wings were covered with silver scales and its skin was like one of a snake, coloured in bloodred. </p><p>\u00bbNi\u00f0ur! (down)\u00ab A yell was heard and only now Antaris could see a woman riding on the back of this ungodly being. \u00bbR\u00f3a\u00f0u \u00feig, stelpa (calm down girl)\u00ab She said.</p><p>She was wearing a black dress, her hair messy and begrimed, her hands were stained with blood and her eyes white, completely white, there was no sign of her irises or pupils, she looked as if she just rose up from the dead.</p><p>She looked around, an evil grin spreading across her face at the sight of the fear she set in the hearts of the present. \u00bbAnd so, from the darkness I rise, \u2018cause of the darkness I am made.\u00ab She began.</p><p>\u00bbAnd I forge my weapon not in flames, 'cause the flames shall be my weapon.\u00ab Her voice was like a poison, spreading and infecting everybody who listened. \u00bbAnd as I stand, covered in the ashes of my past, like a phoenix, I open my wings proud. No force on this world or the world beyond could stop me, for I am not a force to be reckoned with.\u00ab</p><p>She paused, then continued, her voice cold as ice. \u00bbMy screams will wake the dead, and with my screams I will pour fear in the bodies of my enemies. For the first time in history, world will awake. For the battles that await it, will take the sleep away.\u00ab Her voice cut through the air like a knife and no one dared to even think about getting in her way. \u00bbI am not a monster. I am the one who the monster\u2019s afraid of.\u00ab</p>",

It was a silver-looking, trumpet shaped organza dress, that showed a fair amount of the girl&rsquo;s cleavage. </p><p>He neared her carefully, something about her appearance just didn&rsquo;t seem of this world. </p><p>He coughed. &raquo;hey, you okay there?&laquo;</p><p>She gasped, clearly frightened by his sudden presence. </p><p>&raquo;Hver ertu?&laquo; She outed, her voice demanding, her eyes untrusting.</p><p>&raquo;I&hellip; I am sorry, I don&rsquo;t understand.&laquo; Peter stuttered, trying to sound reassuring, but failing.</p><p>Her eyes widened slightly, she took a deep breath. &raquo;Who&hellip; who are you?&laquo; She gulped.</p><p>She was barely holding up her posture, and before Peter was even able to answer, her body gave in.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;<b><i>STARK TOWER</i></b></p><p><b><i><br /></i></b></p><p>&raquo;Mr. Stark, Mr. Stark, please, help!&laquo; Peter entered the main quarters of the Stark tower, carrying a girl.</p><p>&raquo;Jesus kid, what happened?&laquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice was concerned.</p><p>&raquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I found her walking down the river shore.&laquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice was a few frequencies higher than normal.</p><p>&raquo;Do you know who she is or where she came from?&laquo; Bruce chimed in, stepping closer to take a look at the girl.</p><p>&raquo;No, she collapsed before I even managed to find out her name.&laquo; Peter answered, his eyes never leaving her.</p><p>&raquo;Her body temperature is way too low, we need to take her to the ER and warm her up.&laquo; Bruce lifted her body gently, taking her to the tower&rsquo;s emergency room. </p><p>&raquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s going to be okay?&laquo; Peter asked, looking up at Tony.</p><p>&raquo;I don&rsquo;t know kid, I don&rsquo;t know.&laquo;</p><p><i><b>TIME SKIP</b></i></p><p>It has been three days, since Peter brought you to the tower and yet, you still hadn&rsquo;t woken up and still, nobody knew where you came from. You had nothing on you, when you were brought in, no phone, no wallet, nothing, all everyone could do was wait and guess.</p><p>&raquo;Was I too late?&laquo; Peter asked, looking through you hospital room&rsquo;s window, his eyes fixed on you.</p><p>&raquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so, I just think she must&rsquo;ve gone through something very serious and her body needs some time to recover&hellip;&laquo; just as he was about to continue, your heart monitor started beeping maniacally. </p><p>You were dreaming, you knew it was a dream because you were looking yourself from a third person&rsquo;s view. Your subconsciousness took you back to the time where you were little. You saw your three year old self, holding your father&rsquo;s hand, looking up at the frescoes. </p><p>&raquo;Dad?&laquo; Your voice came out as if it was muffled by water.</p><p>&raquo;Yes my dear?&laquo; Your father smiled down at you.</p><p>&raquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&laquo; You pointed at a fresco of a woman in black, her hair covering most of her facial features. </p><p>You looked at the picture closely, then suddenly, her head tilted up, uncovering her completely white eyes and her lips, forming into an evil grin. </p><p>You screamed. The image of your young self and your father disheveled in front of you and all you could hear was loud and fast beeping. The beeping wouldn&rsquo;t stop, it just kept lasting and lasting and it got louder and louder, every now and then, you could hear a male voice going &raquo;is she alright, what&rsquo;s happening?&laquo;. Then out of nowhere, everything went silent, the last thing you remember hearing was a harsh whisper hissing out your name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once again, you woke up with a gasp and once again, you had absolutely no idea where you were. You looked around, finally &nbsp;noticing two, horrified looking faces. Looking at the young one, everything came rushing back to you; your mother sending you away, the dirty shore you first woke up on, the boy in the red mask that somewhat reminded you of the one standing in front of you, everything. </p><p>You rubbed your temples, trying hard to swallow the tears that were gathering at the back of your eyes. </p><p>A voice cut through the room. &raquo;Ms, can you understand us? Can you tell us who you are?&laquo; The older of the two men in your room took a step closer. </p><p>You cleared your throat. &raquo;My name is Y/N, I am of a place called Antares and I am a daughter of Asedrotting and Trygvekonungur.&laquo;</p><p>Both of them looked at you, confused as the have probably never been before in their lives. &raquo;Right&hellip; Y/N can you tell us how you got here or why?&laquo; Bruce continued to question you.</p><p>His words made you feel like a shrapnel just hit your chest, when you remembered the warm purple light your mum used to send you here.</p><p>You sighed, holding your tears back once more. &raquo;I was sent here by my mother to be protected.&laquo;</p><p>&raquo;Protected? Protected from what?!&laquo;</p><p>&nbsp;<i><b>ANTARES</b></i></p><p>&raquo;Mard&#491;ll, hvernig l&iacute;tur &thorn;a&eth; &uacute;t? (how&rsquo;s it looking?)&laquo; Ase asked, fear glimmering in her eyes.</p><p>&raquo;&thorn;a&eth; er a&eth; koma, drottningin m&iacute;n (she&rsquo;s coming, my queen).&laquo; The warrior bowed her head.</p><p>Before Ase even managed to continue her sentence, a loud clash was heard coming from the outside of the castle.</p><p>The ground began to shake, enormous flocks of ravens started circling the sky, letting out their unnerving caws. Out of the blue, a crack began to spread across the place, it was getting wider and wider and it soon formed a huge gap. </p><p>Antaris that were gathered outside were scared, none of them knew what was going on, something seemed to be coming for them and nobody knew what it was.</p><p>Black fog started coming from the gap that formed just seconds ago, it was twisting in unnatural shapes and it had this horrible, unwelcoming scent of something dead. The whole scene was disconcerting to watch. </p><p>One of the men witnessing the unfold, stepped closer to the fog and raised his hand in order to touch it. His hand barely grazed the dark substance, when a painful scream erupted from his lungs. First, his palm turned black and then this same blackness started spreading through his veins, turning his entire body into ashes. </p><p>The crowd stood in fear like statues. </p><p>A loud screech echoed through the abyss. It was getting louder and louder by seconds and soon a growling creature rose up from the fog surrounding it. It was a wyvern, it&rsquo;s mighty wings were covered with silver scales and its skin was like one of a snake, coloured in bloodred. </p><p>&raquo;Ni&eth;ur! (down)&laquo; A yell was heard and only now Antaris could see a woman riding on the back of this ungodly being. &raquo;R&oacute;a&eth;u &thorn;ig, stelpa (calm down girl)&laquo; She said.</p><p>She was wearing a black dress, her hair messy and begrimed, her hands were stained with blood and her eyes white, completely white, there was no sign of her irises or pupils, she looked as if she just rose up from the dead.</p><p>She looked around, an evil grin spreading across her face at the sight of the fear she set in the hearts of the present. &raquo;And so, from the darkness I rise, &lsquo;cause of the darkness I am made.&laquo; She began.</p><p>&raquo;And I forge my weapon not in flames, 'cause the flames shall be my weapon.&laquo; Her voice was like a poison, spreading and infecting everybody who listened. &raquo;And as I stand, covered in the ashes of my past, like a phoenix, I open my wings proud. No force on this world or the world beyond could stop me, for I am not a force to be reckoned with.&laquo;</p><p>She paused, then continued, her voice cold as ice. &raquo;My screams will wake the dead, and with my screams I will pour fear in the bodies of my enemies. For the first time in history, world will awake. For the battles that await it, will take the sleep away.&laquo; Her voice cut through the air like a knife and no one dared to even think about getting in her way. &raquo;I am not a monster. I am the one who the monster&rsquo;s afraid of.&laquo;</p>",

But it&rsquo;s already two a.m. and you are here while everybody is already asleep. You need a break,\u201c you insist. You are worried about him, but as usual he doesn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>\u201eI am fine. You should go back to bed,\u201c he replies without even looking at you.</p><p>That makes you angry and you touch him by the shoulder, forcing him to give you his attention.</p><p>\u201eYou are so stubborn. Did you watch yourself in the mirrow lately? You seem tired and exhausted. You are done for tonight,\u201c you demand and he burrows his eyesbrows. He doesn&rsquo;t understand why you are so concern about his mental condition.</p><p>He shruggs and continues working. \u201eLike I said I am good and now leave or stay, but don&rsquo;t bother me!\u201c</p><p>You gasp at his rude words and cross the arms before your breast. \u201eI am not going anywhere.

But you couldn&rsquo;t start a fight with him in the middle of the night; you need to stay calm.</p><p>\u201eAm I not enough?\u201c you ask quietly. \u201eNatasha and Steve talked to me a few minutes ago and asked me to look after you, when I was already on the way to you. So I really think they care for you, because they are your friends&hellip;\u201c</p><p>Tony interrupts you harshly. \u201eWhy didn&rsquo;t they come down to tell me?\u201c</p><p>You take a deep breath. \u201eWe two have the best connection and they know that.\u201c</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t have the energy to discuss with you.

Let me do my work. I need to finish this,\u201c he explains with a emotionless voice. </p><p>\u201eOh really? Of course, you have a due day!\u201c you respond with a sarcrastic tone. \u201eYour work is always so important. More important than your friends. That&rsquo;s a shame, Tony.\u201c</p><p>Now you are really making him upset. \u201eYou were never mad about my work, you know I need something to do,\u201c he shouts and throws the wrench on the table. His breath quickens and his eyes shimmers with anger, but you can see that he is hurt too. </p><p>\u201eYeah, it is okay. But your work mania got sheer enormities. You are a workaholic. And I am sorry that I am worried about you,\u201c you yell back and clench your jaw. \u201eI am sorry that my best friend thinks I would do this to rile you and I wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate what you did with your brilliant ideas and inventions for us. But you are only human and you need a fucking break. Now do me a favour and go to bed.\u201c</p><p>You feel guilty that you nearly yell at him and you need to speak with him like this. You watch how his shoulders fall and his gaze goes soft.</p><p>Tony accepts that you are right, he needs to give in this one time. It is the third try from you this week to convince him to get at least a nap.</p><p>\u201eI am sorry, Y/N,\u201c he whispers and you sigh with a shooking head.</p><p>\u201eI hate to fight with you,\u201c you tell him and you think it is the best thing to leave his lab and him alone. But on the other side you don&rsquo;t want to let him alone.</p><p>\u201eYou know I really tried to understand what made you so stubborn. But I think that&rsquo;s just a protective mechanism from you. You are hiding here, because this is maybe the only place where you don&rsquo;t think about your feelings. So many nights you spent in this lab and you&hellip; yeah you even locked yourself inside of it,\u201c you laugh bitter. </p><p>Tony watches you with surprise. Your words shocks him. He never thought that you care this much about him and you would notice all this little things about him. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I had no idea that you are so aware of everything. I don&rsquo;t want you to worry about me. You know&hellip; it&rsquo;s just, I am not used to it that there is someone who is interested to look after me. I&hellip; don&rsquo;t how to handle it&hellip;,&rdquo; Tony tries to explain and you realize how broken he must be inside. He doesn&rsquo;t look you right in the eyes, and as you don&rsquo;t reply anything, he wants to pay attention to his work again, thinking the conversation is over. He is sure, if you see how messed-up he is, you don&rsquo;t want to take care of it. So he gives you silencely the oppurtunity to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not leaving. We have all struggles with something. You are not the only one. And don&rsquo;t start to tell me now, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what you are going through and I wouldn&rsquo;t know how you are feeling. I admit I really don&rsquo;t know it, because I am not inside you. But here are humans that care about you&hellip; I do it. But if you don&rsquo;t want this&hellip; that&rsquo;s okay&hellip; I accept this, because it&rsquo;s senseless to fight against you. I don&rsquo;t give up on you&hellip; but I won&rsquo;t force you. I am right here&hellip;\u201c</p><p>Tony turns around and he seems really angry. &quot;What is this now?&rdquo;</p><p>\u201eYou listened, that&rsquo;s good\u201c you say calmly and give him a little smile. </p><p>\u201eWhat are you expecting?\u201c</p><p>You sigh quietly. \u201eI don&rsquo;t expect anything. I am worried and I want to help you, but&hellip; I&hellip;\u201c</p><p>\u201eBut what?\u201c he snaps back. You flinch and stare with wide eyes at him. </p><p>\u201eWhat is it?\u201c</p><p>\u201eYou know, Tony, you made it really hard for others to like you and I can&rsquo;t believe that I am actually in love with you,\u201c you shout back.</p><p>Now is Tony starring at you with a shocking expression. He hears your words, but it takes a few seconds until his brain considers the meaning of your words.</p><p>\u201eYou love me?\u201c he asks in disbelief.</p><p>\u201eYes,\u201c you say simply and that is all he needs to know.</p><p>Tony takes five large steps to stand right before. You can&rsquo;t realize what happens, until his right arm snakes around your waist and the other palms your cheek to pull you in a soft kiss. </p><p>Your eyes are following his actions and you are a little suprised, but his lips are so smooth and warm that your eyes flutters shut.</p><p>You always think about what it would feels like to kiss him, reality is so much better.</p><p>You tangel your fingers in his hair and intensifie the kiss. Your tongue licks his bottom lip, asking silently for entrance which he allows happily.</p><p>You hum gladly and press yourself further to his body. </p><p>The kiss goes rough and steamy, but soon you both are parting breathless.</p><p>Tony looks at you with a half grin and it makes him so sexy. </p><p>\u201eWow,\u201c you whisper and he gives you chills as his hands caresses your sides.</p><p>\u201eI think that was overdue,\u201c he chuckles and you have to laugh along with him.</p><p>\u201eAnd you know what?\u201c he adds. You shook smiling your head.</p><p>\u201eI love you too.\u201c</p><p>You peck his lips and interwine your fingers. This night turns out unexpected for you, but you are happy now.</p><p>\u201eLet&rsquo;s get you into bed, Tony.\u201c</p><p>And finally he comes with you to get his well-earned sleep.</p>",

He always works, you think sadly and shake your head as you see how tired he looks. </p><p>\u201eWhy do you always stay the night here?\u201c you question and he jumps a little bit, because you were scaring him. </p><p>\u201eWarn a men, Y/N,\u201c he sighs in relief and gives you a stern glare.</p><p>\u201eI am sorry. But it\u2019s already two a.m. and you are here while everybody is already asleep. You need a break,\u201c you insist. You are worried about him, but as usual he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201eI am fine. You should go back to bed,\u201c he replies without even looking at you.</p><p>That makes you angry and you touch him by the shoulder, forcing him to give you his attention.</p><p>\u201eYou are so stubborn. Did you watch yourself in the mirrow lately? You seem tired and exhausted. You are done for tonight,\u201c you demand and he burrows his eyesbrows. He doesn\u2019t understand why you are so concern about his mental condition.</p><p>He shruggs and continues working. \u201eLike I said I am good and now leave or stay, but don\u2019t bother me!\u201c</p><p>You gasp at his rude words and cross the arms before your breast. \u201eI am not going anywhere. And stop talking like nobody cares about you. We all like you and\u2026\u201c</p><p>Tony groans angrily and turns around to you. \u201eThey care about me? And why then they are not here too? There is just you.\u201c</p><p>You press thumb and forefinger to the bridge of your nose. You get headache from his stubborness. But you couldn\u2019t start a fight with him in the middle of the night; you need to stay calm.</p><p>\u201eAm I not enough?\u201c you ask quietly. \u201eNatasha and Steve talked to me a few minutes ago and asked me to look after you, when I was already on the way to you. So I really think they care for you, because they are your friends\u2026\u201c</p><p>Tony interrupts you harshly. \u201eWhy didn\u2019t they come down to tell me?\u201c</p><p>You take a deep breath. \u201eWe two have the best connection and they know that.\u201c</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have the energy to discuss with you. He knows you were a kind and warm-hearted person, always be there for your friends and family. He hates when you stay up the whole night because of him, so he thinks if he is more rude to you, you would give up. But you are stubborn as himself.</p><p>\u201eGo back to bed, Y/N. Let me do my work. I need to finish this,\u201c he explains with a emotionless voice. </p><p>\u201eOh really? Of course, you have a due day!\u201c you respond with a sarcrastic tone. \u201eYour work is always so important. More important than your friends. That\u2019s a shame, Tony.\u201c</p><p>Now you are really making him upset. \u201eYou were never mad about my work, you know I need something to do,\u201c he shouts and throws the wrench on the table. His breath quickens and his eyes shimmers with anger, but you can see that he is hurt too. </p><p>\u201eYeah, it is okay. But your work mania got sheer enormities. You are a workaholic. And I am sorry that I am worried about you,\u201c you yell back and clench your jaw. \u201eI am sorry that my best friend thinks I would do this to rile you and I wouldn\u2019t appreciate what you did with your brilliant ideas and inventions for us. But you are only human and you need a fucking break. Now do me a favour and go to bed.\u201c</p><p>You feel guilty that you nearly yell at him and you need to speak with him like this. You watch how his shoulders fall and his gaze goes soft.</p><p>Tony accepts that you are right, he needs to give in this one time. It is the third try from you this week to convince him to get at least a nap.</p><p>\u201eI am sorry, Y/N,\u201c he whispers and you sigh with a shooking head.</p><p>\u201eI hate to fight with you,\u201c you tell him and you think it is the best thing to leave his lab and him alone. But on the other side you don\u2019t want to let him alone.</p><p>\u201eYou know I really tried to understand what made you so stubborn. But I think that\u2019s just a protective mechanism from you. You are hiding here, because this is maybe the only place where you don\u2019t think about your feelings. So many nights you spent in this lab and you\u2026 yeah you even locked yourself inside of it,\u201c you laugh bitter. </p><p>Tony watches you with surprise. Your words shocks him. He never thought that you care this much about him and you would notice all this little things about him. </p><p>\u201cY/N, I had no idea that you are so aware of everything. I don\u2019t want you to worry about me. You know\u2026 it\u2019s just, I am not used to it that there is someone who is interested to look after me. I\u2026 don\u2019t how to handle it\u2026,\u201d Tony tries to explain and you realize how broken he must be inside. He doesn\u2019t look you right in the eyes, and as you don\u2019t reply anything, he wants to pay attention to his work again, thinking the conversation is over. He is sure, if you see how messed-up he is, you don\u2019t want to take care of it. So he gives you silencely the oppurtunity to leave.</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving.
