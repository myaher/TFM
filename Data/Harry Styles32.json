But no one, not even Celine, had an idea how much Y/N used to <i>adore</i> that woman.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence that Marcy started seeing Bradford not so long after Tam&rsquo;s death. Before that she used to be an employee at the his hardware store in Holmes Chapel. She was clever, pretty, and funny\u00a0\u2014 everything a man could ever dream of. And for an impressionable little girl like Y/N, Marcy was the kind of woman she wanted to become. She used to give Y/N useful advice on boy issues, on how to deal with mean girls in school, and she also had a great taste in literature and music. How could anyone not love Marcy?</p><p><i>How could anyone not love Marcy?</i></p><p>The more Y/N thought about it, the sadder it got. People like Marcy could have\u00a0<i>anything</i>\u00a0they wanted, even<i> a married man</i>; and those like her mother had no choice but to accept defeat and swallow the pain.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N felt very disgusted by her father\u2019s wrongful affair, but most importantly, she felt like she&rsquo;d betrayed her mother for even liking the person who&rsquo;d torn their family apart. Her friendship with Marcy made her feel terribly guilty towards her mum, to the point where she ended up lying to Harry that she&rsquo;d never met that woman before their dinner with her dad.</p><p>However, ever since Harry came back, those two had gradually become the least of her concerns. As a matter of fact, she didn&rsquo;t even hate Marcy as much as before. She knew she couldn&rsquo;t stop their wedding from happening, thus the only thing she&rsquo;d asked from her father\u2019s future wife was to leave her alone and stay out of her life. But Marcy didn&rsquo;t seem to get that. She went all the way against Y/N&rsquo;s request by showing up at her door three nights before the wedding.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m visiting a friend in the city so I thought I should pay you a visit,&rdquo; Marcy said to the confused girl who was glued to the spot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually going shopping. Wanna come with me? We can get you a cute dress for my wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you think it was a good idea to show up here?&rdquo; Y/N said, lifting an eyebrow. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m very busy. I can&rsquo;t go with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy that you accepted the invitation. I know this is hard for you but&hellip;<i>please</i> don&rsquo;t be like this,&rdquo; Marcy begged as she reached for Y/N&rsquo;s hand, causing the girl to freeze in an instant. &ldquo;Please give me a chance to get to know you again&hellip;I\u2014I&rsquo;m not asking much just let me buy you a dress to the wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, Y/N could envision her slamming the door and turning a deaf ear to everything Marcy had just said to carry on with her half-finished work in progress. In reality, however, she was actually considering the offer.</p><p>She&rsquo;d told herself to stop running away from the past and focus on the future, because this grudge she held against her father and his fianc\u00e9 had only been doing her damage. At the end, it was her own worries that ended up breaking her heart. Maybe she could never like Marcy the same way she used to, but she could give her a chance to fix her wrongdoings. A little effort to make peace was still better than nothing at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Y/N said at last, making Marcy squeal in joy. &ldquo;Wait here, I&rsquo;ll go get my coat.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>As Jeff was briefing Harry about his shooting schedule for June, the actor let all the words fly from one ear to the other while his eyes stayed fixed on the phone, allowing his hairdresser to do whatever she wanted. He had put all the trust in her to make him look the best for tonight as he knew she had never disappointed him or his fans.</p><p>Yes, a red-carpet event sounded immensely fun and exciting, but truthfully, Harry hated these occasions and would only go when he must. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Niall, who&rsquo;d written most of the songs on the movie soundtrack and would be there as well, he wouldn&rsquo;t have agreed to attend that premiere.</p><p><i>Ping!</i></p><p>A text popped up on the screen, now distracting Harry even more from what Jeff was rambling on about.</p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Just ran into Mrs. Huang. She complained about us being too loud again.</p><p>Trying hard not to laugh at the message, the man bit his bottom lip and quickly typed down a response:</p><p>\u2332 <i>Always fucked you good, didn&rsquo;t I? Pretty proud of myself. ;)</i></p><p>\u2332<b> Bambi: </b>Harry!</p><p>\u2332 <i>Well, you started it.</i></p><p>\u2332 <i>Now I cannot stop thinking about last night&hellip;</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi: </b>Why are you always horny at the worst time?</p><p>\u2332 <i>Are you in class?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Nope, dress shopping with THE bride.</p><p>\u2332 <i>Who?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Marcy.</p><p>\u2332 <i>Lol really?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Really.</p><p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said the hairdresser as she patted Harry on the back. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you dressed.&rdquo;</p><p>\u2332 <i>Gotta go. Tell me all about it tonight?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Okay.</p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi: </b>CANNOT WAIT TO SEE YOUR RED CARPET PHOTOS!!!</p><p>Harry giggled at the text for he could hear her shouting with enthusiasm in his head. Jeff called him louder for the second time, causing the actor to look up and finally notice all the questioning stares his whole crew was giving him.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you still sitting there?! Hurry up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry, coming!&rdquo; He shouted cheerfully, wasting no time to fly right out of his chair and following Jeff out of the room.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N sucked in a deep breath as she stared at her reflection in the full-length mirror, slightly tugging on the flared skirt of her pastel pink gown. It now occurred to the girl that she hadn&rsquo;t gone shopping in a while. Lately her life had been all about student debts, writer&rsquo;s block, and family drama. She seemed to forget how to really take care of herself.</p><p>Tilting her head to the side, she happily thought, maybe with some nice clothes and red lipstick on, she could be just as beautiful as the models Harry used to date.</p><p>&ldquo;I think this looks cute on you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s pastel pink,&rdquo; said Y/N as she turned around to face Marcy. &ldquo;I hate this color.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You used to love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Little Y/N would grab all the pink items in the store and try on every single piece just because she was obsessed with the hue. But she was a different person back then \u2014 a bubbly young girl who saw pink in everything in her life. She&rsquo;d read somewhere that the pink color stood for <i>unconditional love</i> and <i>understanding</i>, both of which she&rsquo;d completely lost faith in as she grew up. Now without the kaleidoscope for an eye, her life was always either black or blue.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have this same dress in a darker color?&rdquo; Marcy asked an employee in the store, but Y/N stopped that lady right before she could walk away.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we take a break?&rdquo; she turned to her future stepmum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying on dresses for half an hour already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, alright.&rdquo; Marcy awkwardly nodded as she watched the twenty-year-old flop down on the sofa and pull out her phone \u2014 something she always did to avoid unwanted conversations. Taking a seat beside the girl, Marcy didn&rsquo;t mean to be nosy, but it was hard to ignore the beam on Y/N&rsquo;s face in reaction to her phone repeatedly <i>pinging</i> with new messages. It didn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out whom they were all from.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Marcy trailed off, hands linked together to rest on her knees. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to the wedding with Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Y/N replied shortly without looking at her.</p><p>So she waited a couple seconds more before asking another question. &ldquo;Are you two dating?&rdquo;</p><p>With this one, Y/N finally peeled her eyes off the screen and turned to her dad&rsquo;s fianc\u00e9, an eyebrow raised in annoyance. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; She scoffed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t friends go to a wedding together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo; Marcy freaked out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;your dad said\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dad doesn&rsquo;t know anything about me.&rdquo; Y/N shook her head. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even know my favorite book even though I used to rant about it at dinner every night. Do you really think he knows or cares whom I&rsquo;m dating?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What Happens In London</i> by <i>Julia Quinn</i>, right? Your favorite book?&rdquo;</p><p>The question for an answer caught Y/N by surprise this time. &ldquo;How do you\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;\u2014<i>remember</i>?&rdquo; Marcy raised a smile. &ldquo;You once told me your favorite quote from the book was:<i> &lsquo;When a man writes a romance, the woman dies. When a woman writes one, it ends all tidy and sweet.</i>&rsquo; It&rsquo;s become my favorite quote ever since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still my favorite,&rdquo; Y/N mumbled; for the first time in forever, showing a genuine smile in front of Marcy.</p><p>That seemed like a good beginning for everything to go back to the way it\u2019d been. Y/N forgot about her hatred for this woman who began to talk about how <i>Sir Harry Valentine</i> in the book was everyone&rsquo;s dream man, and all the things she adored about <i>Lady Olivia Bevelstok</i>e.</p><p>&ldquo;Sassy, witty, and strong. That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s one of the best female characters.&rdquo; Y/N giggled, leaving a massive grin on Marcy&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;If you love Lady Bevelstoke then you should really take this dress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does she have to do with this dress?&rdquo; The twenty-year-old squinted her eyes in confusion as she looked down at the pink gown she was wearing. Such bright color always overwhelmed her, giving her the feeling that other people might stare, when all she wanted was to blend into the crowd or be invisible. She wasn&rsquo;t used to getting excessive attention.</p><p>But Marcy only rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you forgot Olivia&rsquo;s &rsquo;<i>Unmarried Lady Sorts of Things</i><i>&rsquo;</i><i> </i>list. The first thing is: &rsquo;<i>Wear pastel colors</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<i>And be quite glad if you possess the correct complexion for such hues</i>&rsquo;,&rdquo; Y/N nodded her head slowly, chuckling to herself. &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make the rules, Y/N. Olivia did.&rdquo;</p><p>Marcy rose up, pulling a giggly Y/N back to the full length mirror and telling the girl to stand tall, chin up.</p><p>&ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; she encouraged, lips curved into a wide grin. &ldquo;<i>Lady Bevelstoke</i>.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>The name got the younger girl smiling from ear to ear. With one long look at her own reflection, Y/N inhaled deeply. &quot;Okay.&rdquo; She nodded at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; Marcy squealed, clapping her hands. &ldquo;You go change and I&rsquo;ll pay for this dress then we&rsquo;ll head out to dinner!&rdquo;</p><p>In that moment, watching the woman dash away to go get an employee, Y/N must admit that she was <i>genuinely</i> happy. She changed back to her own clothes and brought the dress to the front counter, still wearing the same smile.</p><p>But she really should&rsquo;ve known better \u2014 that every bit of happiness in her life up to that point had been all short-lived, <i>including</i> that moment right then in the store.</p><p>She saw Marcy hand the employee her credit card, and her stomach clenched immediately as she noticed the shiny little rock on Marcy&rsquo;s slim ring finger. Y/N&rsquo;s smile broke, and so did her heart. She frantically clutched Marcy&rsquo;s left wrist, yanking it up, causing the woman to release a startled gasp as her mouth fell open.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this&hellip;my&hellip;my grandmother&rsquo;s ring?&rdquo;</p><p>Marcy withdrew her hand when Y/N&rsquo;s grip became uncomfortably tight as if it was meant to break her bone.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; She answered, fear overtaking her face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also my engagement ring&hellip;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Y/N laughed wryly.</p><p><i>Everything</i>.</p><p>Her dad had used that ring to propose to her mother, who had <i>never</i> taken it off when she was alive, not even once, not even to do house chores, not even when they threw things at the wall and he screamed at her. That was how much the ring meant to the late woman. And the fact that Marcy was wearing it around her finger today could only meant one thing \u2014 Y/N&rsquo;s father took it from her mother&rsquo;s body just to put it on the hand of his new and younger wife.</p><p>She might&rsquo;ve been fooled twice, but she wasn&rsquo;t stupid. She wasn&rsquo;t convinced that Marcy truly had no idea what was wrong. This woman was either extremely dumb, or viciously pretentious, and Y/N knew better than anyone that Marcy was a smart person. And even though she also knew what her parents had wasn&rsquo;t love, it was still painful to think how fast a person could erase from his memory the one he&rsquo;d vowed to treasure for the rest of his life.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not <i>your</i> ring,&rdquo; Y/N said with her fists clenched tight. &ldquo;This belongs to my mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For god&rsquo;s sake! Your mother is <i>dead, </i>Y/N!<i>&rdquo; </i>The harsh emphasis on that one word punched Y/N right in the guts, causing her heart to wrench, yet Marcy didn&rsquo;t just stop there. &ldquo;What is a <i>dead</i> woman gonna do? Dig her way out of her grave and cut off my finger?&rdquo;</p><p><i>That</i> was the final straw.</p><p>&ldquo;I was right about you&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N scoffed, quivering lips formed a broken smirk as she shook her head slowly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but a homewrecker. A husband-stealing <i>whore</i> that\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>Marcy&rsquo;s hand smacked across her face, snapping it back with force and causing the girl to clutch her cheek, eyes watering. The small cut below her eye marked by the ring could be easily noticed from a distance. And Marcy was petrified now that she\u2019d realized what she&rsquo;d done.\u00a0</p><p>Both of them could hear whispers from the other people in the store who didn&rsquo;t want to interfere with their conflict, even though it was shocking how those two had gone from laughing together to one slapping the other.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo; Marcy reached out, attempting to touch Y/N&rsquo;s face. But the girl immediately took a step back to dodge those hands like a bullet.</p><p>Knowing how hot-tempered Y/N had always been, Marcy expected a slap for revenge right then and there, but all that she received was a sense of fear in those glistening eyes. Without another word, the girl ran fast out of the store, ignoring Marcy calling out to her. She ran and didn&rsquo;t look back.</p><p>Soon she found herself lost in a river of pedestrians, all were either in a rush or minding their own business, and would just raise their voice if someone accidentally bumped into them. Y/N swirled around those strangers as the panic rose in her chest. She didn&rsquo;t even think, letting her feet guide the way to end up outside Harry&rsquo;s house.\u00a0</p><p>Trying to steady her breathing pace, Y/N flopped onto the doorstep, holding both knees to her chest and trying to ignore the stung of the slap evident on her red cheek. Though the last thing she wanted was to bother Harry while he was having fun at the after party, she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from pulling out her phone and dialing his number. She felt the need to be with someone, not just anyone,\u00a0<i>him</i>.\u00a0.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I just ran into Ruby.&rdquo;</i></p><p>When Harry heard those words from Niall, his nerves were frayed. The party around him still continued, the music was still blasting at maximum volume, and all the guests in fancy clothes were still dancing and having a blast; to Harry, however, the entire world stopped as his whole body turned to stone.</p><p>He had never been claustrophobic before, but right now he began to feel suffocated for he knew <i>she</i> was somewhere in that same crowd. She could be in a different room, or just a few steps away from where he stood, still what mattered was the fact that she was <i>there</i>.</p><p>The mixture of expensive perfumes in the air along with loud laughter and rowdy conversations caused Harry a headache. He looked from left to right, frantically searching for the figure of the woman he used to love, unable to decide whether he was trying to spot her so he could hide from her, or just to see her face again.</p><p>It was annoying, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Harry thought he&rsquo;d mastered not thinking about Ruby, now the possibility of running into her had him plagued with a sinking stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t at the premiere,&rdquo; He nervously blurted, making his friend heave a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;She probably skipped it. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did she&hellip;did she say something to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Niall&rsquo;s hesitation before answering that one question got Harry sweating in his suit.</p><p>&ldquo;She asked me where you were. She wanted to speak to you about something, but I told her that you didn&rsquo;t want to see her again.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded slightly as he muttered a weak &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; before rushing towards the nearest exit. Despite Niall desperately calling out to ask where he was going, the actor only walked faster. Once again, he found himself running away from the ghost of his past, like the same old <i>pathetic</i> Harry a couple months ago. It was awkward, embarrassing even.</p><p>As he stumbled through the door, his brain was filled with questions that needed answers. What had gotten into him back there? Why was he so afraid of meeting Ruby again? Was it because he still hadn&rsquo;t moved on? <i>Wait. No.</i> He was sure that he had. Because the only girl that&rsquo;d been on his mind lately was his Bambi, <i>only</i> his Bambi. Maybe he should get back to her.</p><p>His throat was dry when he swallowed hard and got into the backseat of his car. He told his driver Y/N&rsquo;s address, hoping that she was still awake to let him in. While chewing on his bottom lip impatiently, Harry looked out of the window, watching streetlights passing by and processing all the complicated thoughts running right through his head. He didn&rsquo;t want to start guessing what it was that Ruby wanted to talk about.</p><p>The loud ringtone pierced right through the silence in the car, causing Harry to flinch as he took out the device from his jacket. Once he saw <b>Bambi</b><b> </b>on the screen, he picked up without reluctance, but the girl didn&rsquo;t give him a chance to speak first.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right outside your door.&rdquo;</i> Her voice was rapid and fear-filled, making his heart halt for a split second as he quickly told the driver to go back to his house instead.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way home,&rdquo; he said fast into the phone. &ldquo;What happened? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;I need to see you&hellip;&rdquo; </i>She sounded strained, which made him worry even more.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there. Can you wait five more minutes?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo; </i>was all she said before hanging up on him.</p><p>Harry put his phone away and urged the driver to speed up, thanking god that it was late and the avenue was clear. In less than five minutes, he had arrived at his London home. He thanked the driver and rushed out of the vehicle to find Y/N sitting on his doorstep. With both knees held close to her chest, the girl only looked up when she heard his hasty footsteps on the pavement coming her way.</p><p>She&rsquo;d been holding back from the moment she got there, but as soon as he showed up, it didn&rsquo;t take too long for her eyes to flood with tears. She didn&rsquo;t explain. He didn&rsquo;t ask. In silence she fell into his arms and he held her tight, one hand at the back of her head while his other arm locked around her waist. She desperately needed that hug right now. But little did she know, he needed it just as much.</p><p>He kissed her temple as she clutched onto his jacket, telling her no matter what had happened, it was all fine now that he was there. It was dark outside so Harry didn&rsquo;t notice the welt on her cheek at first, but now that he had, he felt a physical pain surging through his bones. He took her face with tenderness. His hands were cold, but the softness of his touch made her feel warm inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Did&hellip;did she hit you?&rdquo; Sadness clouded his features when she shook her head to deny it, still the look on her face screamed a loud <i>yes</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Quickly, he unlocked the door and pulled her into his living room where he could hold her for much longer without being afraid of curious eyes on the street. Harry didn&rsquo;t ask anymore questions, knowing she would only tell the truth once she was calm enough and ready to confide in him. Now his job was to make her feel safe. He gave her one of his t-shirts so she could change out of her clothes and asked her to wait in the bedroom for him to return with a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>She looked exactly like the night they first met. Underneath that hard shell she&rsquo;d created for herself was still the same little girl who ran away from her parents&rsquo; fight to a place where she felt safe. And he couldn&rsquo;t decide whether it was disheartening or endearing to see her this vulnerable. Maybe it was a terrible mixture of both. No matter how hard she tried to disregard the nine-year-old she once was, he knew from the sadness in her eyes that she had never really changed.</p><p>In silence, he watched her finish her water, smiling at the way his t-shirt looked too big on her. He wanted to just hold her in his arms and shower her face with sweet kisses until she fell asleep.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; he said when she handed him back the empty glass. But when he turned away, her fingers were locked around his wrist, pulling him back to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go&hellip;&rdquo; She begged. &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was just about to say it would only take a minute, yet he didn&rsquo;t have the heart to deny Y/N&rsquo;s little request when she was giving him <i>that</i> face.</p><p>Nodding his head once, the man set the glass down on the nightstand then climbed onto the bed, pulling her close. Now that she was lying close to his chest, he thought she might feel his heart beat for her. They stayed in that position for a while, with him stroking her hair, and her fidgeting with the buttons of his white shirt. She loved the smell of his cologne which always put her at ease. While wearing his shirt and wrapped up in his arms, she was soaked in the scent of him, thinking she could stay like that forever and always.</p><p>&ldquo;I read somewhere that when you lie too close to a person and can listen to their heart beat, your heart will slowly beat in sync with theirs,&rdquo; she said, which came out as a whisper and she felt his body shake with quiet laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Then your heart must be going insane right now.&rdquo; His joke made her eye roll, but he was staring at the ceiling so he probably had missed that precious smile she put on for him.</p><p>After another moment of silence, Y/N had regained her composure to finally tell Harry what had happened at the store, everything but the reason for the mark on her cheek, though she believed Harry had already figured it out.\u00a0</p><p>She breathed steadily, sorrow dawned on her face as she broke the silence once again, &ldquo;when I was little, my dad used to say <i>'I love you&rsquo;</i> to my mum all the time. In the morning. In the afternoon. Before bed. Every single chance he got, he said those words to her. But one day he suddenly stopped. I assumed he just forgot somehow, not knowing the last time I heard him say he loved her would actually be the last.&rdquo; Her voice was trembling with various emotions. &ldquo;From that day he raised his voice so often, he smashed furniture and made her cry instead of making her laugh. Maybe he never actually loved her. And those <i>'I love you&rsquo;s</i> that he used to say everyday meant nothing at all. It&rsquo;s just so depressing to think about it&hellip;isn&rsquo;t it? How fast a human&rsquo;s heart can change. How easy they can say those words and take it back whenever they want.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s chest lifted when he sucked in a deep breath and slowly let it all out.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he did love her at one point,&rdquo; he said, causing the girl to purse her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what <i>love</i> supposed to be like? Something so fleeting that happens once and can just vanish the next moment?&rdquo;</p><p>Those words really made Harry think.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</p><p>Shifting a bit so he could look at her face, he lifted her chin with his fingers so they were eye to eye and lips to lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about him anymore,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Focus on me.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nervously giggled. For the first time since their kiss in the rain, Harry felt her shiver like a teenage girl being touched for the first time. There was something about the way the bedroom light reflecting in her weary eyes that got him hypnotized.</p><p>&ldquo;Want you to fuck me,&rdquo; she whimpered, hot breath fanning his mouth before their lips attached for a passionate kiss. On spur of the moment, Harry shook his head rapidly, flipping them over so he was hovering above her. His pulsing member was right between her legs where she wanted him most now.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it slow this time.&rdquo; He swallowed hard, stroking away the pain on her cheek with his thumb. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s alright with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could only answer by nodding fast, and that was all Harry had waited for to kiss her again, slipping his tongue past her lips, gasping when she held his hips down to feel him grow against her thigh. Slowly, as he wished, she unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off to reveal his bare chest, running her fingertips across his tattoos as if she was learning the map to remember every single detail inked on his torso.\u00a0</p><p>With a hand at the back of his neck, she pulled him down to get a taste of those lips again. She could never get over their sweetness and she enjoyed the way he groaned into her open mouth. His crotch was slightly rubbing against her clothed sex, creating some fiction to maintain the tiny bit of self-control he&rsquo;d got left.</p><p>The feeling was so strange, overwhelming, yet made him feel complete. His t-shirt that she was wearing soon came off after she&rsquo;d managed to get him out of his tight jeans. They made out slowly with only his boxers in the way as his fingers found their favorite spot between her thighs. He kissed her hard, wanting to devour down every single sound she made, loving all the different ways she whispered his name. He loved to know no one else had the privilege to make her feel this good.\u00a0Only him.</p><p>&ldquo;There you go, baby. <i>Fuck</i>, that&rsquo;s my girl,&rdquo; he growled into her mouth as she rode out her first orgasm, one hand gripping his wrist as the movements of his fingers was gradually slowing down. He could get off just by looking at the way her face screwed up for pleasure, knowing he was the only one who could touch her this way, kiss her this way, hold her this way. &ldquo;All mine,&rdquo; Harry whispered, stroking her hair as he tugged down his boxers while she was recovering.</p><p>&ldquo;All yours, H. Want you&hellip;<i>fuck</i>&hellip;want you inside&hellip;&rdquo; The sounds she made was the most heavenly he&rsquo;d ever heard. God, he loved every single word she said to him. The fact that they weren&rsquo;t in a rush turned him on even more. He was so hard for her that his eyes watered when her sweaty palm wrapped around him to stroke him slow. It felt so good, but if she continued, this would end embarrassingly soon.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shit</i>, baby&hellip;Stop&hellip;&rdquo; He took her wrist and removed her hand quickly. His breathing became ragged when he rolled the condom on and kissed her again. Both of them gasped out loud the second he started to push in slowly for her to adjust to the fullness. Now they could feel everything at once.</p><p>His hand reached for hers and they interlocked as he kissed her tenderly, mumbling &ldquo;you feel amazing&rdquo; and &ldquo;so tight for me&rdquo; against her plum lips. He was completely mesmerized by the way she scrunched her nose and tossed her head back. He couldn&rsquo;t help it, he had to bite down on that pretty neck, causing her fingers to tangle in his messy hair. The feeling caused them both to shiver in complete pleasure and ecstasy.</p><p>His warm hands roamed all over her naked body, stroking her flushed skin with affection as he focused on every single thrust, going steady and deep, wanting her to feel all of him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo; He breathed into Y/N&rsquo;s mouth, making her laugh slightly as she opened her eyes to stare back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gorgeous,&rdquo; she whispered, holding onto his neck to bring his lips back on hers. He slowly massaged her my breast as they kiss, causing her back to arch as she rewarded him with another soft moan. For his every thrust, her chest rose and fell dramatically. He could feel her getting close as her drenched walls were squeezing him when they maintained eye contact. Her stare was intense, yet tender, and sweet. The noises she made when she fell apart would come back to haunt him in his most beautiful dreams. Harry pushed faster, one hand holding her face, the other holding one of her legs up so he could give it to her harder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, baby, that&rsquo;s it&hellip;<i>Fuck</i>,&rdquo; he blurted through gritted teeth, feeling himself coming close but he didn&rsquo;t want to close his eyes in fear of missing out her reaction to how good he was making her feel. With one loud gasp, Y/N came hard around him. Harry felt himself so close to the edge, just a few pushes more&hellip;</p><p>But then it happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&hellip;<i>I love you</i>&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes shot open wide. In the haziness of his own pleasure, he could still hear those three words so loud and clear. It wasn&rsquo;t a mistake. Y/N breathed harshly through her nose as she clung onto his back when he shuddered and came hard into the condom.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Those three words was now echoing inside his brain as both of them tried to catch their breath. Harry&rsquo;s expression hardened as he stared at Y/N, yet the girl only seemed confused.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; She quietly giggled, stroking his cheek. &ldquo;Did I say something silly when I came again?&rdquo;</p><p>With that question, he knew she didn&rsquo;t realize it. She&rsquo;d let those words slip out in the heat of the moment. She didn&rsquo;t even remember saying them.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He pressed his lips into a nervous smile, but he guessed she couldn&rsquo;t see it through. &ldquo;I kind of spaced out&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N stayed silent and kissed his nose. The beam on her face made him feel twice as guilty. What would he have done if those words hadn&rsquo;t got out by accident? Would he have said them back?</p><p>Now in the darkness of the room, with her warm body pressed against his, Harry felt so hard to breathe. The feeling was no different from having a panic attack, and he was glad that Y/N had fallen asleep and couldn&rsquo;t sense that something was definitely wrong. He couldn&rsquo;t even shut his eyes now, just lying there in silence, staring at the moonlit ceiling and thinking hard about those words she&rsquo;d said, which scared him witless.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Harry squeezed his eyes shut, pinching his forehead as he tried to get rid of the voice inside his head that sounded just like her. He tried to count sheep in the hope that it would help him drift off, when the buzzing of his phone on the nightstand struck right through his brain. Y/N was too exhausted to be bothered by the noise, still she did shift around a little bit, so Harry quickly turned off the alert before it woke her.\u00a0</p><p>But the moment he saw  who was calling,\u00a0the color all drained out of his face.</p><p><b>RUBY</b></p>",

She knew she couldn\u2019t stop their wedding from happening, thus the only thing she\u2019d asked from her father\u2019s future wife was to leave her alone and stay out of her life. But Marcy didn\u2019t seem to get that. She went all the way against Y/N\u2019s request by showing up at her door three nights before the wedding.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting a friend in the city so I thought I should pay you a visit,\u201d Marcy said to the confused girl who was glued to the spot. \u201cI\u2019m actually going shopping. Wanna come with me? We can get you a cute dress for my wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you think it was a good idea to show up here?\u201d Y/N said, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m very busy. I can\u2019t go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy that you accepted the invitation. I know this is hard for you but\u2026<i>please</i> don\u2019t be like this,\u201d Marcy begged as she reached for Y/N\u2019s hand, causing the girl to freeze in an instant. \u201cPlease give me a chance to get to know you again\u2026I\u2014I\u2019m not asking much just let me buy you a dress to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Y/N could envision her slamming the door and turning a deaf ear to everything Marcy had just said to carry on with her half-finished work in progress. In reality, however, she was actually considering the offer.</p><p>She\u2019d told herself to stop running away from the past and focus on the future, because this grudge she held against her father and his fianc\u00e9 had only been doing her damage. At the end, it was her own worries that ended up breaking her heart. Maybe she could never like Marcy the same way she used to, but she could give her a chance to fix her wrongdoings. A little effort to make peace was still better than nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Y/N said at last, making Marcy squeal in joy. \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll go get my coat.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>As Jeff was briefing Harry about his shooting schedule for June, the actor let all the words fly from one ear to the other while his eyes stayed fixed on the phone, allowing his hairdresser to do whatever she wanted. He had put all the trust in her to make him look the best for tonight as he knew she had never disappointed him or his fans.</p><p>Yes, a red-carpet event sounded immensely fun and exciting, but truthfully, Harry hated these occasions and would only go when he must. If it hadn\u2019t been for Niall, who\u2019d written most of the songs on the movie soundtrack and would be there as well, he wouldn\u2019t have agreed to attend that premiere.</p><p><i>Ping!</i></p><p>A text popped up on the screen, now distracting Harry even more from what Jeff was rambling on about.</p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Just ran into Mrs. Huang. She complained about us being too loud again.</p><p>Trying hard not to laugh at the message, the man bit his bottom lip and quickly typed down a response:</p><p>\u2332 <i>Always fucked you good, didn\u2019t I? Pretty proud of myself. ;)</i></p><p>\u2332<b> Bambi: </b>Harry!</p><p>\u2332 <i>Well, you started it.</i></p><p>\u2332 <i>Now I cannot stop thinking about last night\u2026</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi: </b>Why are you always horny at the worst time?</p><p>\u2332 <i>Are you in class?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Nope, dress shopping with THE bride.</p><p>\u2332 <i>Who?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Marcy.</p><p>\u2332 <i>Lol really?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Really.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d said the hairdresser as she patted Harry on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s get you dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u2332 <i>Gotta go. Tell me all about it tonight?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Okay.</p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi: </b>CANNOT WAIT TO SEE YOUR RED CARPET PHOTOS!!!</p><p>Harry giggled at the text for he could hear her shouting with enthusiasm in his head. Jeff called him louder for the second time, causing the actor to look up and finally notice all the questioning stares his whole crew was giving him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still sitting there?! Hurry up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry, coming!\u201d He shouted cheerfully, wasting no time to fly right out of his chair and following Jeff out of the room.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N sucked in a deep breath as she stared at her reflection in the full-length mirror, slightly tugging on the flared skirt of her pastel pink gown. It now occurred to the girl that she hadn\u2019t gone shopping in a while. Lately her life had been all about student debts, writer\u2019s block, and family drama. She seemed to forget how to really take care of herself.</p><p>Tilting her head to the side, she happily thought, maybe with some nice clothes and red lipstick on, she could be just as beautiful as the models Harry used to date.</p><p>\u201cI think this looks cute on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pastel pink,\u201d said Y/N as she turned around to face Marcy. \u201cI hate this color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Little Y/N would grab all the pink items in the store and try on every single piece just because she was obsessed with the hue. But she was a different person back then \u2014 a bubbly young girl who saw pink in everything in her life. She\u2019d read somewhere that the pink color stood for <i>unconditional love</i> and <i>understanding</i>, both of which she\u2019d completely lost faith in as she grew up. Now without the kaleidoscope for an eye, her life was always either black or blue.</p><p>\u201cDo you have this same dress in a darker color?\u201d Marcy asked an employee in the store, but Y/N stopped that lady right before she could walk away.</p><p>\u201cCan we take a break?\u201d she turned to her future stepmum. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying on dresses for half an hour already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, alright.\u201d Marcy awkwardly nodded as she watched the twenty-year-old flop down on the sofa and pull out her phone \u2014 something she always did to avoid unwanted conversations. Taking a seat beside the girl, Marcy didn\u2019t mean to be nosy, but it was hard to ignore the beam on Y/N\u2019s face in reaction to her phone repeatedly <i>pinging</i> with new messages. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out whom they were all from.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Marcy trailed off, hands linked together to rest on her knees. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the wedding with Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N replied shortly without looking at her.</p><p>So she waited a couple seconds more before asking another question. \u201cAre you two dating?\u201d</p><p>With this one, Y/N finally peeled her eyes off the screen and turned to her dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9, an eyebrow raised in annoyance. \u201cWhat?\u201d She scoffed. \u201cCan\u2019t friends go to a wedding together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course!\u201d Marcy freaked out. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026your dad said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d Y/N shook her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know my favorite book even though I used to rant about it at dinner every night. Do you really think he knows or cares whom I\u2019m dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What Happens In London</i> by <i>Julia Quinn</i>, right? Your favorite book?\u201d</p><p>The question for an answer caught Y/N by surprise this time. \u201cHow do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014<i>remember</i>?\u201d Marcy raised a smile. \u201cYou once told me your favorite quote from the book was:<i> \u2018When a man writes a romance, the woman dies. When a woman writes one, it ends all tidy and sweet.</i>\u2019 It\u2019s become my favorite quote ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still my favorite,\u201d Y/N mumbled; for the first time in forever, showing a genuine smile in front of Marcy.</p><p>That seemed like a good beginning for everything to go back to the way it\u2019d been. Y/N forgot about her hatred for this woman who began to talk about how <i>Sir Harry Valentine</i> in the book was everyone\u2019s dream man, and all the things she adored about <i>Lady Olivia Bevelstok</i>e.</p><p>\u201cSassy, witty, and strong. That\u2019s why she\u2019s one of the best female characters.\u201d Y/N giggled, leaving a massive grin on Marcy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIf you love Lady Bevelstoke then you should really take this dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she have to do with this dress?\u201d The twenty-year-old squinted her eyes in confusion as she looked down at the pink gown she was wearing. Such bright color always overwhelmed her, giving her the feeling that other people might stare, when all she wanted was to blend into the crowd or be invisible. She wasn\u2019t used to getting excessive attention.</p><p>But Marcy only rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you forgot Olivia\u2019s \u2019<i>Unmarried Lady Sorts of Things</i><i>\u2019</i><i> </i>list. The first thing is: \u2019<i>Wear pastel colors</i>\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019<i>And be quite glad if you possess the correct complexion for such hues</i>\u2019,\u201d Y/N nodded her head slowly, chuckling to herself. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make the rules, Y/N. Olivia did.\u201d</p><p>Marcy rose up, pulling a giggly Y/N back to the full length mirror and telling the girl to stand tall, chin up.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d she encouraged, lips curved into a wide grin. \u201c<i>Lady Bevelstoke</i>.\"\u00a0</p><p>The name got the younger girl smiling from ear to ear. With one long look at her own reflection, Y/N inhaled deeply. \"Okay.\u201d She nodded at last. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Marcy squealed, clapping her hands. \u201cYou go change and I\u2019ll pay for this dress then we\u2019ll head out to dinner!\u201d</p><p>In that moment, watching the woman dash away to go get an employee, Y/N must admit that she was <i>genuinely</i> happy. She changed back to her own clothes and brought the dress to the front counter, still wearing the same smile.</p><p>But she really should\u2019ve known better \u2014 that every bit of happiness in her life up to that point had been all short-lived, <i>including</i> that moment right then in the store.</p><p>She saw Marcy hand the employee her credit card, and her stomach clenched immediately as she noticed the shiny little rock on Marcy\u2019s slim ring finger. Y/N\u2019s smile broke, and so did her heart. She frantically clutched Marcy\u2019s left wrist, yanking it up, causing the woman to release a startled gasp as her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cIs this\u2026my\u2026my grandmother\u2019s ring?\u201d</p><p>Marcy withdrew her hand when Y/N\u2019s grip became uncomfortably tight as if it was meant to break her bone.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She answered, fear overtaking her face. \u201cIt\u2019s also my engagement ring\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Y/N laughed wryly.</p><p><i>Everything</i>.</p><p>Her dad had used that ring to propose to her mother, who had <i>never</i> taken it off when she was alive, not even once, not even to do house chores, not even when they threw things at the wall and he screamed at her. That was how much the ring meant to the late woman. And the fact that Marcy was wearing it around her finger today could only meant one thing \u2014 Y/N\u2019s father took it from her mother\u2019s body just to put it on the hand of his new and younger wife.</p><p>She might\u2019ve been fooled twice, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She wasn\u2019t convinced that Marcy truly had no idea what was wrong. This woman was either extremely dumb, or viciously pretentious, and Y/N knew better than anyone that Marcy was a smart person. And even though she also knew what her parents had wasn\u2019t love, it was still painful to think how fast a person could erase from his memory the one he\u2019d vowed to treasure for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cThis is not <i>your</i> ring,\u201d Y/N said with her fists clenched tight. \u201cThis belongs to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor god\u2019s sake! Your mother is <i>dead, </i>Y/N!<i>\u201d </i>The harsh emphasis on that one word punched Y/N right in the guts, causing her heart to wrench, yet Marcy didn\u2019t just stop there. \u201cWhat is a <i>dead</i> woman gonna do? Dig her way out of her grave and cut off my finger?\u201d</p><p><i>That</i> was the final straw.</p><p>\u201cI was right about you\u2026\u201d Y/N scoffed, quivering lips formed a broken smirk as she shook her head slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a homewrecker. A husband-stealing <i>whore</i> that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Marcy\u2019s hand smacked across her face, snapping it back with force and causing the girl to clutch her cheek, eyes watering. The small cut below her eye marked by the ring could be easily noticed from a distance. And Marcy was petrified now that she\u2019d realized what she\u2019d done.\u00a0</p><p>Both of them could hear whispers from the other people in the store who didn\u2019t want to interfere with their conflict, even though it was shocking how those two had gone from laughing together to one slapping the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d Marcy reached out, attempting to touch Y/N\u2019s face. But the girl immediately took a step back to dodge those hands like a bullet.</p><p>Knowing how hot-tempered Y/N had always been, Marcy expected a slap for revenge right then and there, but all that she received was a sense of fear in those glistening eyes. Without another word, the girl ran fast out of the store, ignoring Marcy calling out to her. She ran and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Soon she found herself lost in a river of pedestrians, all were either in a rush or minding their own business, and would just raise their voice if someone accidentally bumped into them. Y/N swirled around those strangers as the panic rose in her chest. She didn\u2019t even think, letting her feet guide the way to end up outside Harry\u2019s house.\u00a0</p><p>Trying to steady her breathing pace, Y/N flopped onto the doorstep, holding both knees to her chest and trying to ignore the stung of the slap evident on her red cheek. Though the last thing she wanted was to bother Harry while he was having fun at the after party, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from pulling out her phone and dialing his number. She felt the need to be with someone, not just anyone,\u00a0<i>him</i>.\u00a0.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>\u201cI just ran into Ruby.\u201d</i></p><p>When Harry heard those words from Niall, his nerves were frayed. The party around him still continued, the music was still blasting at maximum volume, and all the guests in fancy clothes were still dancing and having a blast; to Harry, however, the entire world stopped as his whole body turned to stone.</p><p>He had never been claustrophobic before, but right now he began to feel suffocated for he knew <i>she</i> was somewhere in that same crowd. She could be in a different room, or just a few steps away from where he stood, still what mattered was the fact that she was <i>there</i>.</p><p>The mixture of expensive perfumes in the air along with loud laughter and rowdy conversations caused Harry a headache. He looked from left to right, frantically searching for the figure of the woman he used to love, unable to decide whether he was trying to spot her so he could hide from her, or just to see her face again.</p><p>It was annoying, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Harry thought he\u2019d mastered not thinking about Ruby, now the possibility of running into her had him plagued with a sinking stomach.</p><p>\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t at the premiere,\u201d He nervously blurted, making his friend heave a sigh.</p><p>\u201cShe probably skipped it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she\u2026did she say something to you?\u201d</p><p>Niall\u2019s hesitation before answering that one question got Harry sweating in his suit.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me where you were. She wanted to speak to you about something, but I told her that you didn\u2019t want to see her again.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded slightly as he muttered a weak \u201cthank you\u201d before rushing towards the nearest exit. Despite Niall desperately calling out to ask where he was going, the actor only walked faster. Once again, he found himself running away from the ghost of his past, like the same old <i>pathetic</i> Harry a couple months ago. It was awkward, embarrassing even.</p><p>As he stumbled through the door, his brain was filled with questions that needed answers. What had gotten into him back there? Why was he so afraid of meeting Ruby again? Was it because he still hadn\u2019t moved on? <i>Wait. No.</i> He was sure that he had. Because the only girl that\u2019d been on his mind lately was his Bambi, <i>only</i> his Bambi. Maybe he should get back to her.</p><p>His throat was dry when he swallowed hard and got into the backseat of his car. He told his driver Y/N\u2019s address, hoping that she was still awake to let him in. While chewing on his bottom lip impatiently, Harry looked out of the window, watching streetlights passing by and processing all the complicated thoughts running right through his head. He didn\u2019t want to start guessing what it was that Ruby wanted to talk about.</p><p>The loud ringtone pierced right through the silence in the car, causing Harry to flinch as he took out the device from his jacket. Once he saw <b>Bambi</b><b> </b>on the screen, he picked up without reluctance, but the girl didn\u2019t give him a chance to speak first.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m right outside your door.\u201d</i> Her voice was rapid and fear-filled, making his heart halt for a split second as he quickly told the driver to go back to his house instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home,\u201d he said fast into the phone. \u201cWhat happened? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026I need to see you\u2026\u201d </i>She sounded strained, which made him worry even more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there. Can you wait five more minutes?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSure\u201d </i>was all she said before hanging up on him.</p><p>Harry put his phone away and urged the driver to speed up, thanking god that it was late and the avenue was clear. In less than five minutes, he had arrived at his London home. He thanked the driver and rushed out of the vehicle to find Y/N sitting on his doorstep. With both knees held close to her chest, the girl only looked up when she heard his hasty footsteps on the pavement coming her way.</p><p>She\u2019d been holding back from the moment she got there, but as soon as he showed up, it didn\u2019t take too long for her eyes to flood with tears. She didn\u2019t explain. He didn\u2019t ask. In silence she fell into his arms and he held her tight, one hand at the back of her head while his other arm locked around her waist. She desperately needed that hug right now. But little did she know, he needed it just as much.</p><p>He kissed her temple as she clutched onto his jacket, telling her no matter what had happened, it was all fine now that he was there. It was dark outside so Harry didn\u2019t notice the welt on her cheek at first, but now that he had, he felt a physical pain surging through his bones. He took her face with tenderness. His hands were cold, but the softness of his touch made her feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026did she hit you?\u201d Sadness clouded his features when she shook her head to deny it, still the look on her face screamed a loud <i>yes</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Quickly, he unlocked the door and pulled her into his living room where he could hold her for much longer without being afraid of curious eyes on the street. Harry didn\u2019t ask anymore questions, knowing she would only tell the truth once she was calm enough and ready to confide in him. Now his job was to make her feel safe. He gave her one of his t-shirts so she could change out of her clothes and asked her to wait in the bedroom for him to return with a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>She looked exactly like the night they first met. Underneath that hard shell she\u2019d created for herself was still the same little girl who ran away from her parents\u2019 fight to a place where she felt safe. And he couldn\u2019t decide whether it was disheartening or endearing to see her this vulnerable. Maybe it was a terrible mixture of both. No matter how hard she tried to disregard the nine-year-old she once was, he knew from the sadness in her eyes that she had never really changed.</p><p>In silence, he watched her finish her water, smiling at the way his t-shirt looked too big on her. He wanted to just hold her in his arms and shower her face with sweet kisses until she fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said when she handed him back the empty glass. But when he turned away, her fingers were locked around his wrist, pulling him back to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go\u2026\u201d She begged. \u201cLie with me.\u201d</p><p>Harry was just about to say it would only take a minute, yet he didn\u2019t have the heart to deny Y/N\u2019s little request when she was giving him <i>that</i> face.</p><p>Nodding his head once, the man set the glass down on the nightstand then climbed onto the bed, pulling her close. Now that she was lying close to his chest, he thought she might feel his heart beat for her. They stayed in that position for a while, with him stroking her hair, and her fidgeting with the buttons of his white shirt. She loved the smell of his cologne which always put her at ease. While wearing his shirt and wrapped up in his arms, she was soaked in the scent of him, thinking she could stay like that forever and always.</p><p>\u201cI read somewhere that when you lie too close to a person and can listen to their heart beat, your heart will slowly beat in sync with theirs,\u201d she said, which came out as a whisper and she felt his body shake with quiet laughter.</p><p>\u201cThen your heart must be going insane right now.\u201d His joke made her eye roll, but he was staring at the ceiling so he probably had missed that precious smile she put on for him.</p><p>After another moment of silence, Y/N had regained her composure to finally tell Harry what had happened at the store, everything but the reason for the mark on her cheek, though she believed Harry had already figured it out.\u00a0</p><p>She breathed steadily, sorrow dawned on her face as she broke the silence once again, \u201cwhen I was little, my dad used to say <i>'I love you\u2019</i> to my mum all the time. In the morning. In the afternoon. Before bed. Every single chance he got, he said those words to her. But one day he suddenly stopped. I assumed he just forgot somehow, not knowing the last time I heard him say he loved her would actually be the last.\u201d Her voice was trembling with various emotions. \u201cFrom that day he raised his voice so often, he smashed furniture and made her cry instead of making her laugh. Maybe he never actually loved her. And those <i>'I love you\u2019s</i> that he used to say everyday meant nothing at all. It\u2019s just so depressing to think about it\u2026isn\u2019t it? How fast a human\u2019s heart can change. How easy they can say those words and take it back whenever they want.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s chest lifted when he sucked in a deep breath and slowly let it all out.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he did love her at one point,\u201d he said, causing the girl to purse her lips.</p><p>\u201cIs that what <i>love</i> supposed to be like? Something so fleeting that happens once and can just vanish the next moment?\u201d</p><p>Those words really made Harry think.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>Shifting a bit so he could look at her face, he lifted her chin with his fingers so they were eye to eye and lips to lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about him anymore,\u201d he told her. \u201cFocus on me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nervously giggled. For the first time since their kiss in the rain, Harry felt her shiver like a teenage girl being touched for the first time. There was something about the way the bedroom light reflecting in her weary eyes that got him hypnotized.</p><p>\u201cWant you to fuck me,\u201d she whimpered, hot breath fanning his mouth before their lips attached for a passionate kiss. On spur of the moment, Harry shook his head rapidly, flipping them over so he was hovering above her. His pulsing member was right between her legs where she wanted him most now.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it slow this time.\u201d He swallowed hard, stroking away the pain on her cheek with his thumb. \u201cIf that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could only answer by nodding fast, and that was all Harry had waited for to kiss her again, slipping his tongue past her lips, gasping when she held his hips down to feel him grow against her thigh. Slowly, as he wished, she unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off to reveal his bare chest, running her fingertips across his tattoos as if she was learning the map to remember every single detail inked on his torso.\u00a0</p><p>With a hand at the back of his neck, she pulled him down to get a taste of those lips again. She could never get over their sweetness and she enjoyed the way he groaned into her open mouth. His crotch was slightly rubbing against her clothed sex, creating some fiction to maintain the tiny bit of self-control he\u2019d got left.</p><p>The feeling was so strange, overwhelming, yet made him feel complete. His t-shirt that she was wearing soon came off after she\u2019d managed to get him out of his tight jeans. They made out slowly with only his boxers in the way as his fingers found their favorite spot between her thighs. He kissed her hard, wanting to devour down every single sound she made, loving all the different ways she whispered his name. He loved to know no one else had the privilege to make her feel this good.\u00a0Only him.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, baby. <i>Fuck</i>, that\u2019s my girl,\u201d he growled into her mouth as she rode out her first orgasm, one hand gripping his wrist as the movements of his fingers was gradually slowing down. He could get off just by looking at the way her face screwed up for pleasure, knowing he was the only one who could touch her this way, kiss her this way, hold her this way. \u201cAll mine,\u201d Harry whispered, stroking her hair as he tugged down his boxers while she was recovering.</p><p>\u201cAll yours, H. Want you\u2026<i>fuck</i>\u2026want you inside\u2026\u201d The sounds she made was the most heavenly he\u2019d ever heard. God, he loved every single word she said to him. The fact that they weren\u2019t in a rush turned him on even more. He was so hard for her that his eyes watered when her sweaty palm wrapped around him to stroke him slow. It felt so good, but if she continued, this would end embarrassingly soon.</p><p>\u201c<i>Shit</i>, baby\u2026Stop\u2026\u201d He took her wrist and removed her hand quickly. His breathing became ragged when he rolled the condom on and kissed her again. Both of them gasped out loud the second he started to push in slowly for her to adjust to the fullness. Now they could feel everything at once.</p><p>His hand reached for hers and they interlocked as he kissed her tenderly, mumbling \u201cyou feel amazing\u201d and \u201cso tight for me\u201d against her plum lips. He was completely mesmerized by the way she scrunched her nose and tossed her head back. He couldn\u2019t help it, he had to bite down on that pretty neck, causing her fingers to tangle in his messy hair. The feeling caused them both to shiver in complete pleasure and ecstasy.</p><p>His warm hands roamed all over her naked body, stroking her flushed skin with affection as he focused on every single thrust, going steady and deep, wanting her to feel all of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d He breathed into Y/N\u2019s mouth, making her laugh slightly as she opened her eyes to stare back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she whispered, holding onto his neck to bring his lips back on hers. He slowly massaged her my breast as they kiss, causing her back to arch as she rewarded him with another soft moan. For his every thrust, her chest rose and fell dramatically. He could feel her getting close as her drenched walls were squeezing him when they maintained eye contact. Her stare was intense, yet tender, and sweet. The noises she made when she fell apart would come back to haunt him in his most beautiful dreams. Harry pushed faster, one hand holding her face, the other holding one of her legs up so he could give it to her harder.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby, that\u2019s it\u2026<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d he blurted through gritted teeth, feeling himself coming close but he didn\u2019t want to close his eyes in fear of missing out her reaction to how good he was making her feel. With one loud gasp, Y/N came hard around him. Harry felt himself so close to the edge, just a few pushes more\u2026</p><p>But then it happened.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026<i>I love you</i>\u2026.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot open wide. In the haziness of his own pleasure, he could still hear those three words so loud and clear. It wasn\u2019t a mistake. Y/N breathed harshly through her nose as she clung onto his back when he shuddered and came hard into the condom.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Those three words was now echoing inside his brain as both of them tried to catch their breath. Harry\u2019s expression hardened as he stared at Y/N, yet the girl only seemed confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She quietly giggled, stroking his cheek. \u201cDid I say something silly when I came again?\u201d</p><p>With that question, he knew she didn\u2019t realize it. She\u2019d let those words slip out in the heat of the moment. She didn\u2019t even remember saying them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pressed his lips into a nervous smile, but he guessed she couldn\u2019t see it through. \u201cI kind of spaced out\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N stayed silent and kissed his nose. The beam on her face made him feel twice as guilty. What would he have done if those words hadn\u2019t got out by accident? Would he have said them back?</p><p>Now in the darkness of the room, with her warm body pressed against his, Harry felt so hard to breathe. The feeling was no different from having a panic attack, and he was glad that Y/N had fallen asleep and couldn\u2019t sense that something was definitely wrong. He couldn\u2019t even shut his eyes now, just lying there in silence, staring at the moonlit ceiling and thinking hard about those words she\u2019d said, which scared him witless.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Harry squeezed his eyes shut, pinching his forehead as he tried to get rid of the voice inside his head that sounded just like her. He tried to count sheep in the hope that it would help him drift off, when the buzzing of his phone on the nightstand struck right through his brain. Y/N was too exhausted to be bothered by the noise, still she did shift around a little bit, so Harry quickly turned off the alert before it woke her.\u00a0</p><p>But the moment he saw  who was calling,\u00a0the color all drained out of his face.</p><p><b>RUBY</b></p></p>",

But no one, not even Celine, had an idea how much Y/N used to <i>adore</i> that woman.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a coincidence that Marcy started seeing Bradford not so long after Tam\u2019s death. Before that she used to be an employee at the his hardware store in Holmes Chapel. She was clever, pretty, and funny\u00a0\u2014 everything a man could ever dream of. And for an impressionable little girl like Y/N, Marcy was the kind of woman she wanted to become. She used to give Y/N useful advice on boy issues, on how to deal with mean girls in school, and she also had a great taste in literature and music. How could anyone not love Marcy?</p><p><i>How could anyone not love Marcy?</i></p><p>The more Y/N thought about it, the sadder it got. People like Marcy could have\u00a0<i>anything</i>\u00a0they wanted, even<i> a married man</i>; and those like her mother had no choice but to accept defeat and swallow the pain.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N felt very disgusted by her father\u2019s wrongful affair, but most importantly, she felt like she\u2019d betrayed her mother for even liking the person who\u2019d torn their family apart. Her friendship with Marcy made her feel terribly guilty towards her mum, to the point where she ended up lying to Harry that she\u2019d never met that woman before their dinner with her dad.</p><p>However, ever since Harry came back, those two had gradually become the least of her concerns. As a matter of fact, she didn\u2019t even hate Marcy as much as before. She knew she couldn\u2019t stop their wedding from happening, thus the only thing she\u2019d asked from her father\u2019s future wife was to leave her alone and stay out of her life. But Marcy didn\u2019t seem to get that. She went all the way against Y/N\u2019s request by showing up at her door three nights before the wedding.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting a friend in the city so I thought I should pay you a visit,\u201d Marcy said to the confused girl who was glued to the spot. \u201cI\u2019m actually going shopping. Wanna come with me? We can get you a cute dress for my wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you think it was a good idea to show up here?\u201d Y/N said, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m very busy. I can\u2019t go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy that you accepted the invitation. I know this is hard for you but\u2026<i>please</i> don\u2019t be like this,\u201d Marcy begged as she reached for Y/N\u2019s hand, causing the girl to freeze in an instant. \u201cPlease give me a chance to get to know you again\u2026I\u2014I\u2019m not asking much just let me buy you a dress to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Y/N could envision her slamming the door and turning a deaf ear to everything Marcy had just said to carry on with her half-finished work in progress. In reality, however, she was actually considering the offer.</p><p>She\u2019d told herself to stop running away from the past and focus on the future, because this grudge she held against her father and his fianc\u00e9 had only been doing her damage. At the end, it was her own worries that ended up breaking her heart. Maybe she could never like Marcy the same way she used to, but she could give her a chance to fix her wrongdoings. A little effort to make peace was still better than nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Y/N said at last, making Marcy squeal in joy. \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll go get my coat.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>As Jeff was briefing Harry about his shooting schedule for June, the actor let all the words fly from one ear to the other while his eyes stayed fixed on the phone, allowing his hairdresser to do whatever she wanted. He had put all the trust in her to make him look the best for tonight as he knew she had never disappointed him or his fans.</p><p>Yes, a red-carpet event sounded immensely fun and exciting, but truthfully, Harry hated these occasions and would only go when he must. If it hadn\u2019t been for Niall, who\u2019d written most of the songs on the movie soundtrack and would be there as well, he wouldn\u2019t have agreed to attend that premiere.</p><p><i>Ping!</i></p><p>A text popped up on the screen, now distracting Harry even more from what Jeff was rambling on about.</p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Just ran into Mrs. Huang. She complained about us being too loud again.</p><p>Trying hard not to laugh at the message, the man bit his bottom lip and quickly typed down a response:</p><p>\u2332 <i>Always fucked you good, didn\u2019t I? Pretty proud of myself. ;)</i></p><p>\u2332<b> Bambi: </b>Harry!</p><p>\u2332 <i>Well, you started it.</i></p><p>\u2332 <i>Now I cannot stop thinking about last night\u2026</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi: </b>Why are you always horny at the worst time?</p><p>\u2332 <i>Are you in class?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Nope, dress shopping with THE bride.</p><p>\u2332 <i>Who?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Marcy.</p><p>\u2332 <i>Lol really?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Really.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d said the hairdresser as she patted Harry on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s get you dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u2332 <i>Gotta go. Tell me all about it tonight?</i></p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi:</b> Okay.</p><p>\u2332 <b>Bambi: </b>CANNOT WAIT TO SEE YOUR RED CARPET PHOTOS!!!</p><p>Harry giggled at the text for he could hear her shouting with enthusiasm in his head. Jeff called him louder for the second time, causing the actor to look up and finally notice all the questioning stares his whole crew was giving him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still sitting there?! Hurry up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry, coming!\u201d He shouted cheerfully, wasting no time to fly right out of his chair and following Jeff out of the room.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N sucked in a deep breath as she stared at her reflection in the full-length mirror, slightly tugging on the flared skirt of her pastel pink gown. It now occurred to the girl that she hadn\u2019t gone shopping in a while. Lately her life had been all about student debts, writer\u2019s block, and family drama. She seemed to forget how to really take care of herself.</p><p>Tilting her head to the side, she happily thought, maybe with some nice clothes and red lipstick on, she could be just as beautiful as the models Harry used to date.</p><p>\u201cI think this looks cute on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pastel pink,\u201d said Y/N as she turned around to face Marcy. \u201cI hate this color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Little Y/N would grab all the pink items in the store and try on every single piece just because she was obsessed with the hue. But she was a different person back then \u2014 a bubbly young girl who saw pink in everything in her life. She\u2019d read somewhere that the pink color stood for <i>unconditional love</i> and <i>understanding</i>, both of which she\u2019d completely lost faith in as she grew up. Now without the kaleidoscope for an eye, her life was always either black or blue.</p><p>\u201cDo you have this same dress in a darker color?\u201d Marcy asked an employee in the store, but Y/N stopped that lady right before she could walk away.</p><p>\u201cCan we take a break?\u201d she turned to her future stepmum. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying on dresses for half an hour already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, alright.\u201d Marcy awkwardly nodded as she watched the twenty-year-old flop down on the sofa and pull out her phone \u2014 something she always did to avoid unwanted conversations. Taking a seat beside the girl, Marcy didn\u2019t mean to be nosy, but it was hard to ignore the beam on Y/N\u2019s face in reaction to her phone repeatedly <i>pinging</i> with new messages. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out whom they were all from.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Marcy trailed off, hands linked together to rest on her knees. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the wedding with Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Y/N replied shortly without looking at her.</p><p>So she waited a couple seconds more before asking another question. \u201cAre you two dating?\u201d</p><p>With this one, Y/N finally peeled her eyes off the screen and turned to her dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9, an eyebrow raised in annoyance. \u201cWhat?\u201d She scoffed. \u201cCan\u2019t friends go to a wedding together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course!\u201d Marcy freaked out. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026your dad said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d Y/N shook her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know my favorite book even though I used to rant about it at dinner every night. Do you really think he knows or cares whom I\u2019m dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What Happens In London</i> by <i>Julia Quinn</i>, right? Your favorite book?\u201d</p><p>The question for an answer caught Y/N by surprise this time. \u201cHow do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014<i>remember</i>?\u201d Marcy raised a smile. \u201cYou once told me your favorite quote from the book was:<i> \u2018When a man writes a romance, the woman dies. When a woman writes one, it ends all tidy and sweet.</i>\u2019 It\u2019s become my favorite quote ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still my favorite,\u201d Y/N mumbled; for the first time in forever, showing a genuine smile in front of Marcy.</p><p>That seemed like a good beginning for everything to go back to the way it\u2019d been. Y/N forgot about her hatred for this woman who began to talk about how <i>Sir Harry Valentine</i> in the book was everyone\u2019s dream man, and all the things she adored about <i>Lady Olivia Bevelstok</i>e.</p><p>\u201cSassy, witty, and strong. That\u2019s why she\u2019s one of the best female characters.\u201d Y/N giggled, leaving a massive grin on Marcy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIf you love Lady Bevelstoke then you should really take this dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she have to do with this dress?\u201d The twenty-year-old squinted her eyes in confusion as she looked down at the pink gown she was wearing. Such bright color always overwhelmed her, giving her the feeling that other people might stare, when all she wanted was to blend into the crowd or be invisible. She wasn\u2019t used to getting excessive attention.</p><p>But Marcy only rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you forgot Olivia\u2019s \u2019<i>Unmarried Lady Sorts of Things</i><i>\u2019</i><i> </i>list. The first thing is: \u2019<i>Wear pastel colors</i>\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019<i>And be quite glad if you possess the correct complexion for such hues</i>\u2019,\u201d Y/N nodded her head slowly, chuckling to herself. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make the rules, Y/N. Olivia did.\u201d</p><p>Marcy rose up, pulling a giggly Y/N back to the full length mirror and telling the girl to stand tall, chin up.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d she encouraged, lips curved into a wide grin. \u201c<i>Lady Bevelstoke</i>.\"\u00a0</p><p>The name got the younger girl smiling from ear to ear. With one long look at her own reflection, Y/N inhaled deeply. \"Okay.\u201d She nodded at last. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Marcy squealed, clapping her hands. \u201cYou go change and I\u2019ll pay for this dress then we\u2019ll head out to dinner!\u201d</p><p>In that moment, watching the woman dash away to go get an employee, Y/N must admit that she was <i>genuinely</i> happy. She changed back to her own clothes and brought the dress to the front counter, still wearing the same smile.</p><p>But she really should\u2019ve known better \u2014 that every bit of happiness in her life up to that point had been all short-lived, <i>including</i> that moment right then in the store.</p><p>She saw Marcy hand the employee her credit card, and her stomach clenched immediately as she noticed the shiny little rock on Marcy\u2019s slim ring finger. Y/N\u2019s smile broke, and so did her heart. She frantically clutched Marcy\u2019s left wrist, yanking it up, causing the woman to release a startled gasp as her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cIs this\u2026my\u2026my grandmother\u2019s ring?\u201d</p><p>Marcy withdrew her hand when Y/N\u2019s grip became uncomfortably tight as if it was meant to break her bone.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She answered, fear overtaking her face. \u201cIt\u2019s also my engagement ring\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Y/N laughed wryly.</p><p><i>Everything</i>.</p><p>Her dad had used that ring to propose to her mother, who had <i>never</i> taken it off when she was alive, not even once, not even to do house chores, not even when they threw things at the wall and he screamed at her. That was how much the ring meant to the late woman. And the fact that Marcy was wearing it around her finger today could only meant one thing \u2014 Y/N\u2019s father took it from her mother\u2019s body just to put it on the hand of his new and younger wife.</p><p>She might\u2019ve been fooled twice, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She wasn\u2019t convinced that Marcy truly had no idea what was wrong. This woman was either extremely dumb, or viciously pretentious, and Y/N knew better than anyone that Marcy was a smart person. And even though she also knew what her parents had wasn\u2019t love, it was still painful to think how fast a person could erase from his memory the one he\u2019d vowed to treasure for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cThis is not <i>your</i> ring,\u201d Y/N said with her fists clenched tight. \u201cThis belongs to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor god\u2019s sake! Your mother is <i>dead, </i>Y/N!<i>\u201d </i>The harsh emphasis on that one word punched Y/N right in the guts, causing her heart to wrench, yet Marcy didn\u2019t just stop there. \u201cWhat is a <i>dead</i> woman gonna do? Dig her way out of her grave and cut off my finger?\u201d</p><p><i>That</i> was the final straw.</p><p>\u201cI was right about you\u2026\u201d Y/N scoffed, quivering lips formed a broken smirk as she shook her head slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a homewrecker. A husband-stealing <i>whore</i> that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Marcy\u2019s hand smacked across her face, snapping it back with force and causing the girl to clutch her cheek, eyes watering. The small cut below her eye marked by the ring could be easily noticed from a distance. And Marcy was petrified now that she\u2019d realized what she\u2019d done.\u00a0</p><p>Both of them could hear whispers from the other people in the store who didn\u2019t want to interfere with their conflict, even though it was shocking how those two had gone from laughing together to one slapping the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d Marcy reached out, attempting to touch Y/N\u2019s face. But the girl immediately took a step back to dodge those hands like a bullet.</p><p>Knowing how hot-tempered Y/N had always been, Marcy expected a slap for revenge right then and there, but all that she received was a sense of fear in those glistening eyes. Without another word, the girl ran fast out of the store, ignoring Marcy calling out to her. She ran and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Soon she found herself lost in a river of pedestrians, all were either in a rush or minding their own business, and would just raise their voice if someone accidentally bumped into them. Y/N swirled around those strangers as the panic rose in her chest. She didn\u2019t even think, letting her feet guide the way to end up outside Harry\u2019s house.\u00a0</p><p>Trying to steady her breathing pace, Y/N flopped onto the doorstep, holding both knees to her chest and trying to ignore the stung of the slap evident on her red cheek. Though the last thing she wanted was to bother Harry while he was having fun at the after party, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from pulling out her phone and dialing his number. She felt the need to be with someone, not just anyone,\u00a0<i>him</i>.\u00a0.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>\u201cI just ran into Ruby.\u201d</i></p><p>When Harry heard those words from Niall, his nerves were frayed. The party around him still continued, the music was still blasting at maximum volume, and all the guests in fancy clothes were still dancing and having a blast; to Harry, however, the entire world stopped as his whole body turned to stone.</p><p>He had never been claustrophobic before, but right now he began to feel suffocated for he knew <i>she</i> was somewhere in that same crowd. She could be in a different room, or just a few steps away from where he stood, still what mattered was the fact that she was <i>there</i>.</p><p>The mixture of expensive perfumes in the air along with loud laughter and rowdy conversations caused Harry a headache. He looked from left to right, frantically searching for the figure of the woman he used to love, unable to decide whether he was trying to spot her so he could hide from her, or just to see her face again.</p><p>It was annoying, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Harry thought he\u2019d mastered not thinking about Ruby, now the possibility of running into her had him plagued with a sinking stomach.</p><p>\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t at the premiere,\u201d He nervously blurted, making his friend heave a sigh.</p><p>\u201cShe probably skipped it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she\u2026did she say something to you?\u201d</p><p>Niall\u2019s hesitation before answering that one question got Harry sweating in his suit.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me where you were. She wanted to speak to you about something, but I told her that you didn\u2019t want to see her again.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded slightly as he muttered a weak \u201cthank you\u201d before rushing towards the nearest exit. Despite Niall desperately calling out to ask where he was going, the actor only walked faster. Once again, he found himself running away from the ghost of his past, like the same old <i>pathetic</i> Harry a couple months ago. It was awkward, embarrassing even.</p><p>As he stumbled through the door, his brain was filled with questions that needed answers. What had gotten into him back there? Why was he so afraid of meeting Ruby again? Was it because he still hadn\u2019t moved on? <i>Wait. No.</i> He was sure that he had. Because the only girl that\u2019d been on his mind lately was his Bambi, <i>only</i> his Bambi. Maybe he should get back to her.</p><p>His throat was dry when he swallowed hard and got into the backseat of his car. He told his driver Y/N\u2019s address, hoping that she was still awake to let him in. While chewing on his bottom lip impatiently, Harry looked out of the window, watching streetlights passing by and processing all the complicated thoughts running right through his head. He didn\u2019t want to start guessing what it was that Ruby wanted to talk about.</p><p>The loud ringtone pierced right through the silence in the car, causing Harry to flinch as he took out the device from his jacket. Once he saw <b>Bambi</b><b> </b>on the screen, he picked up without reluctance, but the girl didn\u2019t give him a chance to speak first.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m right outside your door.\u201d</i> Her voice was rapid and fear-filled, making his heart halt for a split second as he quickly told the driver to go back to his house instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home,\u201d he said fast into the phone. \u201cWhat happened? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2026I need to see you\u2026\u201d </i>She sounded strained, which made him worry even more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there. Can you wait five more minutes?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSure\u201d </i>was all she said before hanging up on him.</p><p>Harry put his phone away and urged the driver to speed up, thanking god that it was late and the avenue was clear. In less than five minutes, he had arrived at his London home. He thanked the driver and rushed out of the vehicle to find Y/N sitting on his doorstep. With both knees held close to her chest, the girl only looked up when she heard his hasty footsteps on the pavement coming her way.</p><p>She\u2019d been holding back from the moment she got there, but as soon as he showed up, it didn\u2019t take too long for her eyes to flood with tears. She didn\u2019t explain. He didn\u2019t ask. In silence she fell into his arms and he held her tight, one hand at the back of her head while his other arm locked around her waist. She desperately needed that hug right now. But little did she know, he needed it just as much.</p><p>He kissed her temple as she clutched onto his jacket, telling her no matter what had happened, it was all fine now that he was there. It was dark outside so Harry didn\u2019t notice the welt on her cheek at first, but now that he had, he felt a physical pain surging through his bones. He took her face with tenderness. His hands were cold, but the softness of his touch made her feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026did she hit you?\u201d Sadness clouded his features when she shook her head to deny it, still the look on her face screamed a loud <i>yes</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Quickly, he unlocked the door and pulled her into his living room where he could hold her for much longer without being afraid of curious eyes on the street. Harry didn\u2019t ask anymore questions, knowing she would only tell the truth once she was calm enough and ready to confide in him. Now his job was to make her feel safe. He gave her one of his t-shirts so she could change out of her clothes and asked her to wait in the bedroom for him to return with a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>She looked exactly like the night they first met. Underneath that hard shell she\u2019d created for herself was still the same little girl who ran away from her parents\u2019 fight to a place where she felt safe. And he couldn\u2019t decide whether it was disheartening or endearing to see her this vulnerable. Maybe it was a terrible mixture of both. No matter how hard she tried to disregard the nine-year-old she once was, he knew from the sadness in her eyes that she had never really changed.</p><p>In silence, he watched her finish her water, smiling at the way his t-shirt looked too big on her. He wanted to just hold her in his arms and shower her face with sweet kisses until she fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said when she handed him back the empty glass. But when he turned away, her fingers were locked around his wrist, pulling him back to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go\u2026\u201d She begged. \u201cLie with me.\u201d</p><p>Harry was just about to say it would only take a minute, yet he didn\u2019t have the heart to deny Y/N\u2019s little request when she was giving him <i>that</i> face.</p><p>Nodding his head once, the man set the glass down on the nightstand then climbed onto the bed, pulling her close. Now that she was lying close to his chest, he thought she might feel his heart beat for her. They stayed in that position for a while, with him stroking her hair, and her fidgeting with the buttons of his white shirt. She loved the smell of his cologne which always put her at ease. While wearing his shirt and wrapped up in his arms, she was soaked in the scent of him, thinking she could stay like that forever and always.</p><p>\u201cI read somewhere that when you lie too close to a person and can listen to their heart beat, your heart will slowly beat in sync with theirs,\u201d she said, which came out as a whisper and she felt his body shake with quiet laughter.</p><p>\u201cThen your heart must be going insane right now.\u201d His joke made her eye roll, but he was staring at the ceiling so he probably had missed that precious smile she put on for him.</p><p>After another moment of silence, Y/N had regained her composure to finally tell Harry what had happened at the store, everything but the reason for the mark on her cheek, though she believed Harry had already figured it out.\u00a0</p><p>She breathed steadily, sorrow dawned on her face as she broke the silence once again, \u201cwhen I was little, my dad used to say <i>'I love you\u2019</i> to my mum all the time. In the morning. In the afternoon. Before bed. Every single chance he got, he said those words to her. But one day he suddenly stopped. I assumed he just forgot somehow, not knowing the last time I heard him say he loved her would actually be the last.\u201d Her voice was trembling with various emotions. \u201cFrom that day he raised his voice so often, he smashed furniture and made her cry instead of making her laugh. Maybe he never actually loved her. And those <i>'I love you\u2019s</i> that he used to say everyday meant nothing at all. It\u2019s just so depressing to think about it\u2026isn\u2019t it? How fast a human\u2019s heart can change. How easy they can say those words and take it back whenever they want.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s chest lifted when he sucked in a deep breath and slowly let it all out.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he did love her at one point,\u201d he said, causing the girl to purse her lips.</p><p>\u201cIs that what <i>love</i> supposed to be like? Something so fleeting that happens once and can just vanish the next moment?\u201d</p><p>Those words really made Harry think.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>Shifting a bit so he could look at her face, he lifted her chin with his fingers so they were eye to eye and lips to lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about him anymore,\u201d he told her. \u201cFocus on me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nervously giggled. For the first time since their kiss in the rain, Harry felt her shiver like a teenage girl being touched for the first time. There was something about the way the bedroom light reflecting in her weary eyes that got him hypnotized.</p><p>\u201cWant you to fuck me,\u201d she whimpered, hot breath fanning his mouth before their lips attached for a passionate kiss. On spur of the moment, Harry shook his head rapidly, flipping them over so he was hovering above her. His pulsing member was right between her legs where she wanted him most now.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it slow this time.\u201d He swallowed hard, stroking away the pain on her cheek with his thumb. \u201cIf that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could only answer by nodding fast, and that was all Harry had waited for to kiss her again, slipping his tongue past her lips, gasping when she held his hips down to feel him grow against her thigh. Slowly, as he wished, she unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off to reveal his bare chest, running her fingertips across his tattoos as if she was learning the map to remember every single detail inked on his torso.\u00a0</p><p>With a hand at the back of his neck, she pulled him down to get a taste of those lips again. She could never get over their sweetness and she enjoyed the way he groaned into her open mouth. His crotch was slightly rubbing against her clothed sex, creating some fiction to maintain the tiny bit of self-control he\u2019d got left.</p><p>The feeling was so strange, overwhelming, yet made him feel complete. His t-shirt that she was wearing soon came off after she\u2019d managed to get him out of his tight jeans. They made out slowly with only his boxers in the way as his fingers found their favorite spot between her thighs. He kissed her hard, wanting to devour down every single sound she made, loving all the different ways she whispered his name. He loved to know no one else had the privilege to make her feel this good.\u00a0Only him.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, baby. <i>Fuck</i>, that\u2019s my girl,\u201d he growled into her mouth as she rode out her first orgasm, one hand gripping his wrist as the movements of his fingers was gradually slowing down. He could get off just by looking at the way her face screwed up for pleasure, knowing he was the only one who could touch her this way, kiss her this way, hold her this way. \u201cAll mine,\u201d Harry whispered, stroking her hair as he tugged down his boxers while she was recovering.</p><p>\u201cAll yours, H. Want you\u2026<i>fuck</i>\u2026want you inside\u2026\u201d The sounds she made was the most heavenly he\u2019d ever heard. God, he loved every single word she said to him. The fact that they weren\u2019t in a rush turned him on even more. He was so hard for her that his eyes watered when her sweaty palm wrapped around him to stroke him slow. It felt so good, but if she continued, this would end embarrassingly soon.</p><p>\u201c<i>Shit</i>, baby\u2026Stop\u2026\u201d He took her wrist and removed her hand quickly. His breathing became ragged when he rolled the condom on and kissed her again. Both of them gasped out loud the second he started to push in slowly for her to adjust to the fullness. Now they could feel everything at once.</p><p>His hand reached for hers and they interlocked as he kissed her tenderly, mumbling \u201cyou feel amazing\u201d and \u201cso tight for me\u201d against her plum lips. He was completely mesmerized by the way she scrunched her nose and tossed her head back. He couldn\u2019t help it, he had to bite down on that pretty neck, causing her fingers to tangle in his messy hair. The feeling caused them both to shiver in complete pleasure and ecstasy.</p><p>His warm hands roamed all over her naked body, stroking her flushed skin with affection as he focused on every single thrust, going steady and deep, wanting her to feel all of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d He breathed into Y/N\u2019s mouth, making her laugh slightly as she opened her eyes to stare back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she whispered, holding onto his neck to bring his lips back on hers. He slowly massaged her my breast as they kiss, causing her back to arch as she rewarded him with another soft moan. For his every thrust, her chest rose and fell dramatically. He could feel her getting close as her drenched walls were squeezing him when they maintained eye contact. Her stare was intense, yet tender, and sweet. The noises she made when she fell apart would come back to haunt him in his most beautiful dreams. Harry pushed faster, one hand holding her face, the other holding one of her legs up so he could give it to her harder.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby, that\u2019s it\u2026<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d he blurted through gritted teeth, feeling himself coming close but he didn\u2019t want to close his eyes in fear of missing out her reaction to how good he was making her feel. With one loud gasp, Y/N came hard around him. Harry felt himself so close to the edge, just a few pushes more\u2026</p><p>But then it happened.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2026<i>I love you</i>\u2026.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot open wide. In the haziness of his own pleasure, he could still hear those three words so loud and clear. It wasn\u2019t a mistake. Y/N breathed harshly through her nose as she clung onto his back when he shuddered and came hard into the condom.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Those three words was now echoing inside his brain as both of them tried to catch their breath. Harry\u2019s expression hardened as he stared at Y/N, yet the girl only seemed confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She quietly giggled, stroking his cheek. \u201cDid I say something silly when I came again?\u201d</p><p>With that question, he knew she didn\u2019t realize it. She\u2019d let those words slip out in the heat of the moment. She didn\u2019t even remember saying them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pressed his lips into a nervous smile, but he guessed she couldn\u2019t see it through. \u201cI kind of spaced out\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N stayed silent and kissed his nose. The beam on her face made him feel twice as guilty. What would he have done if those words hadn\u2019t got out by accident? Would he have said them back?</p><p>Now in the darkness of the room, with her warm body pressed against his, Harry felt so hard to breathe. The feeling was no different from having a panic attack, and he was glad that Y/N had fallen asleep and couldn\u2019t sense that something was definitely wrong. He couldn\u2019t even shut his eyes now, just lying there in silence, staring at the moonlit ceiling and thinking hard about those words she\u2019d said, which scared him witless.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Harry squeezed his eyes shut, pinching his forehead as he tried to get rid of the voice inside his head that sounded just like her. He tried to count sheep in the hope that it would help him drift off, when the buzzing of his phone on the nightstand struck right through his brain. Y/N was too exhausted to be bothered by the noise, still she did shift around a little bit, so Harry quickly turned off the alert before it woke her.\u00a0</p><p>But the moment he saw  who was calling,\u00a0the color all drained out of his face.</p><p><b>RUBY</b></p></p>",

But no one, not even Celine, had an idea how much Y/N used to <i>adore</i> that woman.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence that Marcy started seeing Bradford not so long after Tam&rsquo;s death. Before that she used to be an employee at the his hardware store in Holmes Chapel. She was clever, pretty, and funny&nbsp;&mdash; everything a man could ever dream of. And for an impressionable little girl like Y/N, Marcy was the kind of woman she wanted to become. She used to give Y/N useful advice on boy issues, on how to deal with mean girls in school, and she also had a great taste in literature and music. How could anyone not love Marcy?</p><p><i>How could anyone not love Marcy?</i></p><p>The more Y/N thought about it, the sadder it got. People like Marcy could have&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;they wanted, even<i> a married man</i>; and those like her mother had no choice but to accept defeat and swallow the pain.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N felt very disgusted by her father&rsquo;s wrongful affair, but most importantly, she felt like she&rsquo;d betrayed her mother for even liking the person who&rsquo;d torn their family apart. Her friendship with Marcy made her feel terribly guilty towards her mum, to the point where she ended up lying to Harry that she&rsquo;d never met that woman before their dinner with her dad.</p><p>However, ever since Harry came back, those two had gradually become the least of her concerns. As a matter of fact, she didn&rsquo;t even hate Marcy as much as before. She knew she couldn&rsquo;t stop their wedding from happening, thus the only thing she&rsquo;d asked from her father&rsquo;s future wife was to leave her alone and stay out of her life. But Marcy didn&rsquo;t seem to get that. She went all the way against Y/N&rsquo;s request by showing up at her door three nights before the wedding.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m visiting a friend in the city so I thought I should pay you a visit,&rdquo; Marcy said to the confused girl who was glued to the spot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually going shopping. Wanna come with me? We can get you a cute dress for my wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you think it was a good idea to show up here?&rdquo; Y/N said, lifting an eyebrow. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m very busy. I can&rsquo;t go with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy that you accepted the invitation. I know this is hard for you but&hellip;<i>please</i> don&rsquo;t be like this,&rdquo; Marcy begged as she reached for Y/N&rsquo;s hand, causing the girl to freeze in an instant. &ldquo;Please give me a chance to get to know you again&hellip;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not asking much just let me buy you a dress to the wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, Y/N could envision her slamming the door and turning a deaf ear to everything Marcy had just said to carry on with her half-finished work in progress. In reality, however, she was actually considering the offer.</p><p>She&rsquo;d told herself to stop running away from the past and focus on the future, because this grudge she held against her father and his fianc&eacute; had only been doing her damage. At the end, it was her own worries that ended up breaking her heart. Maybe she could never like Marcy the same way she used to, but she could give her a chance to fix her wrongdoings. A little effort to make peace was still better than nothing at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Y/N said at last, making Marcy squeal in joy. &ldquo;Wait here, I&rsquo;ll go get my coat.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>As Jeff was briefing Harry about his shooting schedule for June, the actor let all the words fly from one ear to the other while his eyes stayed fixed on the phone, allowing his hairdresser to do whatever she wanted. He had put all the trust in her to make him look the best for tonight as he knew she had never disappointed him or his fans.</p><p>Yes, a red-carpet event sounded immensely fun and exciting, but truthfully, Harry hated these occasions and would only go when he must. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Niall, who&rsquo;d written most of the songs on the movie soundtrack and would be there as well, he wouldn&rsquo;t have agreed to attend that premiere.</p><p><i>Ping!</i></p><p>A text popped up on the screen, now distracting Harry even more from what Jeff was rambling on about.</p><p>&#9010; <b>Bambi:</b> Just ran into Mrs. Huang. She complained about us being too loud again.</p><p>Trying hard not to laugh at the message, the man bit his bottom lip and quickly typed down a response:</p><p>&#9010; <i>Always fucked you good, didn&rsquo;t I? Pretty proud of myself. ;)</i></p><p>&#9010;<b> Bambi: </b>Harry!</p><p>&#9010; <i>Well, you started it.</i></p><p>&#9010; <i>Now I cannot stop thinking about last night&hellip;</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>Bambi: </b>Why are you always horny at the worst time?</p><p>&#9010; <i>Are you in class?</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>Bambi:</b> Nope, dress shopping with THE bride.</p><p>&#9010; <i>Who?</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>Bambi:</b> Marcy.</p><p>&#9010; <i>Lol really?</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>Bambi:</b> Really.</p><p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said the hairdresser as she patted Harry on the back. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you dressed.&rdquo;</p><p>&#9010; <i>Gotta go. Tell me all about it tonight?</i></p><p>&#9010; <b>Bambi:</b> Okay.</p><p>&#9010; <b>Bambi: </b>CANNOT WAIT TO SEE YOUR RED CARPET PHOTOS!!!</p><p>Harry giggled at the text for he could hear her shouting with enthusiasm in his head. Jeff called him louder for the second time, causing the actor to look up and finally notice all the questioning stares his whole crew was giving him.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you still sitting there?! Hurry up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry, coming!&rdquo; He shouted cheerfully, wasting no time to fly right out of his chair and following Jeff out of the room.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N sucked in a deep breath as she stared at her reflection in the full-length mirror, slightly tugging on the flared skirt of her pastel pink gown. It now occurred to the girl that she hadn&rsquo;t gone shopping in a while. Lately her life had been all about student debts, writer&rsquo;s block, and family drama. She seemed to forget how to really take care of herself.</p><p>Tilting her head to the side, she happily thought, maybe with some nice clothes and red lipstick on, she could be just as beautiful as the models Harry used to date.</p><p>&ldquo;I think this looks cute on you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s pastel pink,&rdquo; said Y/N as she turned around to face Marcy. &ldquo;I hate this color.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You used to love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Little Y/N would grab all the pink items in the store and try on every single piece just because she was obsessed with the hue. But she was a different person back then &mdash; a bubbly young girl who saw pink in everything in her life. She&rsquo;d read somewhere that the pink color stood for <i>unconditional love</i> and <i>understanding</i>, both of which she&rsquo;d completely lost faith in as she grew up. Now without the kaleidoscope for an eye, her life was always either black or blue.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have this same dress in a darker color?&rdquo; Marcy asked an employee in the store, but Y/N stopped that lady right before she could walk away.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we take a break?&rdquo; she turned to her future stepmum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying on dresses for half an hour already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, alright.&rdquo; Marcy awkwardly nodded as she watched the twenty-year-old flop down on the sofa and pull out her phone &mdash; something she always did to avoid unwanted conversations. Taking a seat beside the girl, Marcy didn&rsquo;t mean to be nosy, but it was hard to ignore the beam on Y/N&rsquo;s face in reaction to her phone repeatedly <i>pinging</i> with new messages. It didn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out whom they were all from.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Marcy trailed off, hands linked together to rest on her knees. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to the wedding with Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Y/N replied shortly without looking at her.</p><p>So she waited a couple seconds more before asking another question. &ldquo;Are you two dating?&rdquo;</p><p>With this one, Y/N finally peeled her eyes off the screen and turned to her dad&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;, an eyebrow raised in annoyance. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; She scoffed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t friends go to a wedding together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo; Marcy freaked out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;your dad said&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dad doesn&rsquo;t know anything about me.&rdquo; Y/N shook her head. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even know my favorite book even though I used to rant about it at dinner every night. Do you really think he knows or cares whom I&rsquo;m dating?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What Happens In London</i> by <i>Julia Quinn</i>, right? Your favorite book?&rdquo;</p><p>The question for an answer caught Y/N by surprise this time. &ldquo;How do you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;<i>remember</i>?&rdquo; Marcy raised a smile. &ldquo;You once told me your favorite quote from the book was:<i> &lsquo;When a man writes a romance, the woman dies. When a woman writes one, it ends all tidy and sweet.</i>&rsquo; It&rsquo;s become my favorite quote ever since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still my favorite,&rdquo; Y/N mumbled; for the first time in forever, showing a genuine smile in front of Marcy.</p><p>That seemed like a good beginning for everything to go back to the way it&rsquo;d been. Y/N forgot about her hatred for this woman who began to talk about how <i>Sir Harry Valentine</i> in the book was everyone&rsquo;s dream man, and all the things she adored about <i>Lady Olivia Bevelstok</i>e.</p><p>&ldquo;Sassy, witty, and strong. That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s one of the best female characters.&rdquo; Y/N giggled, leaving a massive grin on Marcy&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;If you love Lady Bevelstoke then you should really take this dress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does she have to do with this dress?&rdquo; The twenty-year-old squinted her eyes in confusion as she looked down at the pink gown she was wearing. Such bright color always overwhelmed her, giving her the feeling that other people might stare, when all she wanted was to blend into the crowd or be invisible. She wasn&rsquo;t used to getting excessive attention.</p><p>But Marcy only rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you forgot Olivia&rsquo;s &rsquo;<i>Unmarried Lady Sorts of Things</i><i>&rsquo;</i><i> </i>list. The first thing is: &rsquo;<i>Wear pastel colors</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<i>And be quite glad if you possess the correct complexion for such hues</i>&rsquo;,&rdquo; Y/N nodded her head slowly, chuckling to herself. &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make the rules, Y/N. Olivia did.&rdquo;</p><p>Marcy rose up, pulling a giggly Y/N back to the full length mirror and telling the girl to stand tall, chin up.</p><p>&ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; she encouraged, lips curved into a wide grin. &ldquo;<i>Lady Bevelstoke</i>.\"&nbsp;</p><p>The name got the younger girl smiling from ear to ear. With one long look at her own reflection, Y/N inhaled deeply. \"Okay.&rdquo; She nodded at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; Marcy squealed, clapping her hands. &ldquo;You go change and I&rsquo;ll pay for this dress then we&rsquo;ll head out to dinner!&rdquo;</p><p>In that moment, watching the woman dash away to go get an employee, Y/N must admit that she was <i>genuinely</i> happy. She changed back to her own clothes and brought the dress to the front counter, still wearing the same smile.</p><p>But she really should&rsquo;ve known better &mdash; that every bit of happiness in her life up to that point had been all short-lived, <i>including</i> that moment right then in the store.</p><p>She saw Marcy hand the employee her credit card, and her stomach clenched immediately as she noticed the shiny little rock on Marcy&rsquo;s slim ring finger. Y/N&rsquo;s smile broke, and so did her heart. She frantically clutched Marcy&rsquo;s left wrist, yanking it up, causing the woman to release a startled gasp as her mouth fell open.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this&hellip;my&hellip;my grandmother&rsquo;s ring?&rdquo;</p><p>Marcy withdrew her hand when Y/N&rsquo;s grip became uncomfortably tight as if it was meant to break her bone.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; She answered, fear overtaking her face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also my engagement ring&hellip;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Y/N laughed wryly.</p><p><i>Everything</i>.</p><p>Her dad had used that ring to propose to her mother, who had <i>never</i> taken it off when she was alive, not even once, not even to do house chores, not even when they threw things at the wall and he screamed at her. That was how much the ring meant to the late woman. And the fact that Marcy was wearing it around her finger today could only meant one thing &mdash; Y/N&rsquo;s father took it from her mother&rsquo;s body just to put it on the hand of his new and younger wife.</p><p>She might&rsquo;ve been fooled twice, but she wasn&rsquo;t stupid. She wasn&rsquo;t convinced that Marcy truly had no idea what was wrong. This woman was either extremely dumb, or viciously pretentious, and Y/N knew better than anyone that Marcy was a smart person. And even though she also knew what her parents had wasn&rsquo;t love, it was still painful to think how fast a person could erase from his memory the one he&rsquo;d vowed to treasure for the rest of his life.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not <i>your</i> ring,&rdquo; Y/N said with her fists clenched tight. &ldquo;This belongs to my mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For god&rsquo;s sake! Your mother is <i>dead, </i>Y/N!<i>&rdquo; </i>The harsh emphasis on that one word punched Y/N right in the guts, causing her heart to wrench, yet Marcy didn&rsquo;t just stop there. &ldquo;What is a <i>dead</i> woman gonna do? Dig her way out of her grave and cut off my finger?&rdquo;</p><p><i>That</i> was the final straw.</p><p>&ldquo;I was right about you&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N scoffed, quivering lips formed a broken smirk as she shook her head slowly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but a homewrecker. A husband-stealing <i>whore</i> that&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Marcy&rsquo;s hand smacked across her face, snapping it back with force and causing the girl to clutch her cheek, eyes watering. The small cut below her eye marked by the ring could be easily noticed from a distance. And Marcy was petrified now that she&rsquo;d realized what she&rsquo;d done.&nbsp;</p><p>Both of them could hear whispers from the other people in the store who didn&rsquo;t want to interfere with their conflict, even though it was shocking how those two had gone from laughing together to one slapping the other.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo; Marcy reached out, attempting to touch Y/N&rsquo;s face. But the girl immediately took a step back to dodge those hands like a bullet.</p><p>Knowing how hot-tempered Y/N had always been, Marcy expected a slap for revenge right then and there, but all that she received was a sense of fear in those glistening eyes. Without another word, the girl ran fast out of the store, ignoring Marcy calling out to her. She ran and didn&rsquo;t look back.</p><p>Soon she found herself lost in a river of pedestrians, all were either in a rush or minding their own business, and would just raise their voice if someone accidentally bumped into them. Y/N swirled around those strangers as the panic rose in her chest. She didn&rsquo;t even think, letting her feet guide the way to end up outside Harry&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to steady her breathing pace, Y/N flopped onto the doorstep, holding both knees to her chest and trying to ignore the stung of the slap evident on her red cheek. Though the last thing she wanted was to bother Harry while he was having fun at the after party, she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from pulling out her phone and dialing his number. She felt the need to be with someone, not just anyone,&nbsp;<i>him</i>.&nbsp;.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I just ran into Ruby.&rdquo;</i></p><p>When Harry heard those words from Niall, his nerves were frayed. The party around him still continued, the music was still blasting at maximum volume, and all the guests in fancy clothes were still dancing and having a blast; to Harry, however, the entire world stopped as his whole body turned to stone.</p><p>He had never been claustrophobic before, but right now he began to feel suffocated for he knew <i>she</i> was somewhere in that same crowd. She could be in a different room, or just a few steps away from where he stood, still what mattered was the fact that she was <i>there</i>.</p><p>The mixture of expensive perfumes in the air along with loud laughter and rowdy conversations caused Harry a headache. He looked from left to right, frantically searching for the figure of the woman he used to love, unable to decide whether he was trying to spot her so he could hide from her, or just to see her face again.</p><p>It was annoying, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Harry thought he&rsquo;d mastered not thinking about Ruby, now the possibility of running into her had him plagued with a sinking stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t at the premiere,&rdquo; He nervously blurted, making his friend heave a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;She probably skipped it. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did she&hellip;did she say something to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Niall&rsquo;s hesitation before answering that one question got Harry sweating in his suit.</p><p>&ldquo;She asked me where you were. She wanted to speak to you about something, but I told her that you didn&rsquo;t want to see her again.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded slightly as he muttered a weak &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; before rushing towards the nearest exit. Despite Niall desperately calling out to ask where he was going, the actor only walked faster. Once again, he found himself running away from the ghost of his past, like the same old <i>pathetic</i> Harry a couple months ago. It was awkward, embarrassing even.</p><p>As he stumbled through the door, his brain was filled with questions that needed answers. What had gotten into him back there? Why was he so afraid of meeting Ruby again? Was it because he still hadn&rsquo;t moved on? <i>Wait. No.</i> He was sure that he had. Because the only girl that&rsquo;d been on his mind lately was his Bambi, <i>only</i> his Bambi. Maybe he should get back to her.</p><p>His throat was dry when he swallowed hard and got into the backseat of his car. He told his driver Y/N&rsquo;s address, hoping that she was still awake to let him in. While chewing on his bottom lip impatiently, Harry looked out of the window, watching streetlights passing by and processing all the complicated thoughts running right through his head. He didn&rsquo;t want to start guessing what it was that Ruby wanted to talk about.</p><p>The loud ringtone pierced right through the silence in the car, causing Harry to flinch as he took out the device from his jacket. Once he saw <b>Bambi</b><b> </b>on the screen, he picked up without reluctance, but the girl didn&rsquo;t give him a chance to speak first.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right outside your door.&rdquo;</i> Her voice was rapid and fear-filled, making his heart halt for a split second as he quickly told the driver to go back to his house instead.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way home,&rdquo; he said fast into the phone. &ldquo;What happened? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&hellip;I need to see you&hellip;&rdquo; </i>She sounded strained, which made him worry even more.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there. Can you wait five more minutes?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo; </i>was all she said before hanging up on him.</p><p>Harry put his phone away and urged the driver to speed up, thanking god that it was late and the avenue was clear. In less than five minutes, he had arrived at his London home. He thanked the driver and rushed out of the vehicle to find Y/N sitting on his doorstep. With both knees held close to her chest, the girl only looked up when she heard his hasty footsteps on the pavement coming her way.</p><p>She&rsquo;d been holding back from the moment she got there, but as soon as he showed up, it didn&rsquo;t take too long for her eyes to flood with tears. She didn&rsquo;t explain. He didn&rsquo;t ask. In silence she fell into his arms and he held her tight, one hand at the back of her head while his other arm locked around her waist. She desperately needed that hug right now. But little did she know, he needed it just as much.</p><p>He kissed her temple as she clutched onto his jacket, telling her no matter what had happened, it was all fine now that he was there. It was dark outside so Harry didn&rsquo;t notice the welt on her cheek at first, but now that he had, he felt a physical pain surging through his bones. He took her face with tenderness. His hands were cold, but the softness of his touch made her feel warm inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Did&hellip;did she hit you?&rdquo; Sadness clouded his features when she shook her head to deny it, still the look on her face screamed a loud <i>yes</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Quickly, he unlocked the door and pulled her into his living room where he could hold her for much longer without being afraid of curious eyes on the street. Harry didn&rsquo;t ask anymore questions, knowing she would only tell the truth once she was calm enough and ready to confide in him. Now his job was to make her feel safe. He gave her one of his t-shirts so she could change out of her clothes and asked her to wait in the bedroom for him to return with a glass of water.&nbsp;</p><p>She looked exactly like the night they first met. Underneath that hard shell she&rsquo;d created for herself was still the same little girl who ran away from her parents&rsquo; fight to a place where she felt safe. And he couldn&rsquo;t decide whether it was disheartening or endearing to see her this vulnerable. Maybe it was a terrible mixture of both. No matter how hard she tried to disregard the nine-year-old she once was, he knew from the sadness in her eyes that she had never really changed.</p><p>In silence, he watched her finish her water, smiling at the way his t-shirt looked too big on her. He wanted to just hold her in his arms and shower her face with sweet kisses until she fell asleep.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; he said when she handed him back the empty glass. But when he turned away, her fingers were locked around his wrist, pulling him back to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go&hellip;&rdquo; She begged. &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was just about to say it would only take a minute, yet he didn&rsquo;t have the heart to deny Y/N&rsquo;s little request when she was giving him <i>that</i> face.</p><p>Nodding his head once, the man set the glass down on the nightstand then climbed onto the bed, pulling her close. Now that she was lying close to his chest, he thought she might feel his heart beat for her. They stayed in that position for a while, with him stroking her hair, and her fidgeting with the buttons of his white shirt. She loved the smell of his cologne which always put her at ease. While wearing his shirt and wrapped up in his arms, she was soaked in the scent of him, thinking she could stay like that forever and always.</p><p>&ldquo;I read somewhere that when you lie too close to a person and can listen to their heart beat, your heart will slowly beat in sync with theirs,&rdquo; she said, which came out as a whisper and she felt his body shake with quiet laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Then your heart must be going insane right now.&rdquo; His joke made her eye roll, but he was staring at the ceiling so he probably had missed that precious smile she put on for him.</p><p>After another moment of silence, Y/N had regained her composure to finally tell Harry what had happened at the store, everything but the reason for the mark on her cheek, though she believed Harry had already figured it out.&nbsp;</p><p>She breathed steadily, sorrow dawned on her face as she broke the silence once again, &ldquo;when I was little, my dad used to say <i>'I love you&rsquo;</i> to my mum all the time. In the morning. In the afternoon. Before bed. Every single chance he got, he said those words to her. But one day he suddenly stopped. I assumed he just forgot somehow, not knowing the last time I heard him say he loved her would actually be the last.&rdquo; Her voice was trembling with various emotions. &ldquo;From that day he raised his voice so often, he smashed furniture and made her cry instead of making her laugh. Maybe he never actually loved her. And those <i>'I love you&rsquo;s</i> that he used to say everyday meant nothing at all. It&rsquo;s just so depressing to think about it&hellip;isn&rsquo;t it? How fast a human&rsquo;s heart can change. How easy they can say those words and take it back whenever they want.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s chest lifted when he sucked in a deep breath and slowly let it all out.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he did love her at one point,&rdquo; he said, causing the girl to purse her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what <i>love</i> supposed to be like? Something so fleeting that happens once and can just vanish the next moment?&rdquo;</p><p>Those words really made Harry think.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</p><p>Shifting a bit so he could look at her face, he lifted her chin with his fingers so they were eye to eye and lips to lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about him anymore,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Focus on me.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nervously giggled. For the first time since their kiss in the rain, Harry felt her shiver like a teenage girl being touched for the first time. There was something about the way the bedroom light reflecting in her weary eyes that got him hypnotized.</p><p>&ldquo;Want you to fuck me,&rdquo; she whimpered, hot breath fanning his mouth before their lips attached for a passionate kiss. On spur of the moment, Harry shook his head rapidly, flipping them over so he was hovering above her. His pulsing member was right between her legs where she wanted him most now.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it slow this time.&rdquo; He swallowed hard, stroking away the pain on her cheek with his thumb. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s alright with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could only answer by nodding fast, and that was all Harry had waited for to kiss her again, slipping his tongue past her lips, gasping when she held his hips down to feel him grow against her thigh. Slowly, as he wished, she unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off to reveal his bare chest, running her fingertips across his tattoos as if she was learning the map to remember every single detail inked on his torso.&nbsp;</p><p>With a hand at the back of his neck, she pulled him down to get a taste of those lips again. She could never get over their sweetness and she enjoyed the way he groaned into her open mouth. His crotch was slightly rubbing against her clothed sex, creating some fiction to maintain the tiny bit of self-control he&rsquo;d got left.</p><p>The feeling was so strange, overwhelming, yet made him feel complete. His t-shirt that she was wearing soon came off after she&rsquo;d managed to get him out of his tight jeans. They made out slowly with only his boxers in the way as his fingers found their favorite spot between her thighs. He kissed her hard, wanting to devour down every single sound she made, loving all the different ways she whispered his name. He loved to know no one else had the privilege to make her feel this good.&nbsp;Only him.</p><p>&ldquo;There you go, baby. <i>Fuck</i>, that&rsquo;s my girl,&rdquo; he growled into her mouth as she rode out her first orgasm, one hand gripping his wrist as the movements of his fingers was gradually slowing down. He could get off just by looking at the way her face screwed up for pleasure, knowing he was the only one who could touch her this way, kiss her this way, hold her this way. &ldquo;All mine,&rdquo; Harry whispered, stroking her hair as he tugged down his boxers while she was recovering.</p><p>&ldquo;All yours, H. Want you&hellip;<i>fuck</i>&hellip;want you inside&hellip;&rdquo; The sounds she made was the most heavenly he&rsquo;d ever heard. God, he loved every single word she said to him. The fact that they weren&rsquo;t in a rush turned him on even more. He was so hard for her that his eyes watered when her sweaty palm wrapped around him to stroke him slow. It felt so good, but if she continued, this would end embarrassingly soon.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shit</i>, baby&hellip;Stop&hellip;&rdquo; He took her wrist and removed her hand quickly. His breathing became ragged when he rolled the condom on and kissed her again. Both of them gasped out loud the second he started to push in slowly for her to adjust to the fullness. Now they could feel everything at once.</p><p>His hand reached for hers and they interlocked as he kissed her tenderly, mumbling &ldquo;you feel amazing&rdquo; and &ldquo;so tight for me&rdquo; against her plum lips. He was completely mesmerized by the way she scrunched her nose and tossed her head back. He couldn&rsquo;t help it, he had to bite down on that pretty neck, causing her fingers to tangle in his messy hair. The feeling caused them both to shiver in complete pleasure and ecstasy.</p><p>His warm hands roamed all over her naked body, stroking her flushed skin with affection as he focused on every single thrust, going steady and deep, wanting her to feel all of him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo; He breathed into Y/N&rsquo;s mouth, making her laugh slightly as she opened her eyes to stare back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gorgeous,&rdquo; she whispered, holding onto his neck to bring his lips back on hers. He slowly massaged her my breast as they kiss, causing her back to arch as she rewarded him with another soft moan. For his every thrust, her chest rose and fell dramatically. He could feel her getting close as her drenched walls were squeezing him when they maintained eye contact. Her stare was intense, yet tender, and sweet. The noises she made when she fell apart would come back to haunt him in his most beautiful dreams. Harry pushed faster, one hand holding her face, the other holding one of her legs up so he could give it to her harder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, baby, that&rsquo;s it&hellip;<i>Fuck</i>,&rdquo; he blurted through gritted teeth, feeling himself coming close but he didn&rsquo;t want to close his eyes in fear of missing out her reaction to how good he was making her feel. With one loud gasp, Y/N came hard around him. Harry felt himself so close to the edge, just a few pushes more&hellip;</p><p>But then it happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&hellip;<i>I love you</i>&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes shot open wide. In the haziness of his own pleasure, he could still hear those three words so loud and clear. It wasn&rsquo;t a mistake. Y/N breathed harshly through her nose as she clung onto his back when he shuddered and came hard into the condom.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Those three words was now echoing inside his brain as both of them tried to catch their breath. Harry&rsquo;s expression hardened as he stared at Y/N, yet the girl only seemed confused.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; She quietly giggled, stroking his cheek. &ldquo;Did I say something silly when I came again?&rdquo;</p><p>With that question, he knew she didn&rsquo;t realize it. She&rsquo;d let those words slip out in the heat of the moment. She didn&rsquo;t even remember saying them.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He pressed his lips into a nervous smile, but he guessed she couldn&rsquo;t see it through. &ldquo;I kind of spaced out&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N stayed silent and kissed his nose. The beam on her face made him feel twice as guilty. What would he have done if those words hadn&rsquo;t got out by accident? Would he have said them back?</p><p>Now in the darkness of the room, with her warm body pressed against his, Harry felt so hard to breathe. The feeling was no different from having a panic attack, and he was glad that Y/N had fallen asleep and couldn&rsquo;t sense that something was definitely wrong. He couldn&rsquo;t even shut his eyes now, just lying there in silence, staring at the moonlit ceiling and thinking hard about those words she&rsquo;d said, which scared him witless.</p><p><i>I love you.</i></p><p>Harry squeezed his eyes shut, pinching his forehead as he tried to get rid of the voice inside his head that sounded just like her. He tried to count sheep in the hope that it would help him drift off, when the buzzing of his phone on the nightstand struck right through his brain. Y/N was too exhausted to be bothered by the noise, still she did shift around a little bit, so Harry quickly turned off the alert before it woke her.&nbsp;</p><p>But the moment he saw  who was calling,&nbsp;the color all drained out of his face.</p><p><b>RUBY</b></p></p>",

But no one, not even Celine, had an idea how much Y/N used to <i>adore</i> that woman.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence that Marcy started seeing Bradford not so long after Tam&rsquo;s death. Before that she used to be an employee at the his hardware store in Holmes Chapel. She was clever, pretty, and funny&nbsp;&mdash; everything a man could ever dream of. And for an impressionable little girl like Y/N, Marcy was the kind of woman she wanted to become. She used to give Y/N useful advice on boy issues, on how to deal with mean girls in school, and she also had a great taste in literature and music. How could anyone not love Marcy?</p>\n<p><i>How could anyone not love Marcy?</i></p>\n<p>The more Y/N thought about it, the sadder it got. People like Marcy could have&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;they wanted, even<i> a married man</i>; and those like her mother had no choice but to accept defeat and swallow the pain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Y/N felt very disgusted by her father&rsquo;s wrongful affair, but most importantly, she felt like she&rsquo;d betrayed her mother for even liking the person who&rsquo;d torn their family apart. Her friendship with Marcy made her feel terribly guilty towards her mum, to the point where she ended up lying to Harry that she&rsquo;d never met that woman before their dinner with her dad.</p>\n<p>However, ever since Harry came back, those two had gradually become the least of her concerns. As a matter of fact, she didn&rsquo;t even hate Marcy as much as before. She knew she couldn&rsquo;t stop their wedding from happening, thus the only thing she&rsquo;d asked from her father&rsquo;s future wife was to leave her alone and stay out of her life. But Marcy didn&rsquo;t seem to get that. She went all the way against Y/N&rsquo;s request by showing up at her door three nights before the wedding.</p>\n</p>",

                "content": "<p><b>How about Harry stealing Gemma&rsquo;s lipgloss for Bambi?</b></p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, come back here you little&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gemma! Leave your brother alone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But mum! He took my lipgloss!&rdquo;</p><p>Thirteen-year-old Harry tried to contain his laughter as he ran fast to his backyard, knowing for sure his mum would keep Gemma from chasing after him, at least for now. He would figure out a way to deal with her rage later, now he needed to get to the treehouse where his little neighbor was waiting for him. </p><p>Y/N was in shock when the older boy burst through the entrance and flopped down by her side on the floor, gasping for air.</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; With a breathless smile, he pulled out the lipgloss from his pocket and gave it to her. &ldquo;Stole it from Gemma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s mouth fell open as she pushed his hand away. &ldquo;Harry, give it back!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will, but&hellip;you have to put it on first.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N was so confused when he grabbed her chin so he could apply the gloss for her. Once again, she pushed his hand away, eyes squinted as she asked him what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;You have dance class this afternoon, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>Right. Why did she forget? </p><p>Last week Emma freaking Flint wore lipstick to the dance class (for which Y/N&rsquo;s parents had signed her up but she deeply hated it anyway), and all the kids went insane for that. Even though Emma was the most annoying girl Y/N had ever met, Y/N must admit that she looked much prettier with makeup on. But the problem was, Y/N&rsquo;s parents wouldn&rsquo;t allow her to wear makeup until she got into high school, that would be four years from now.
