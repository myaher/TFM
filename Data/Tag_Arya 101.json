As a group, we write individually but we come together to share our collective experiences with different media. For TGE Watches, we talk about movies and TV shows. TGE Plays, we play games together. For TGE Reads, we select a book, read it, and then discuss it together. We are hoping through our collective knowledge and know-how to share these geeky interests with our readers, viewers, and listeners. \n\nListen to our podcast at https://www.thegeekembassy.com/category/podcast",

The strangest part of\nTyrion\u2019s designs were the empty shafts to be built in the walls. Once installed\nthey could be fitted with a contraption that, with the use of a rope or a\ncrank, could lift passengers from level to level of the castle. If it worked\nBran might never have to be carried up and down the stairs of Winterfell again.\nIt was another kindness that Bran didn\u2019t think he deserved. Meera would have\nsharp words for him if she heard those thoughts.</p><p>He was startled when Arya rode close to him, already\nspeaking. \u201cWhat are you brooding about little brother?\u201d she asked \u201cBrooding\ndoesn\u2019t suit you, leave that to Jon.\u201d</p><p>Bran huffed, \u201cI\u2019m not brooding.\u201d Arya made a sound of\nderision and he shook his head, \u201cIt was just a thought. I don\u2019t deserve all\nthese gifts, this kindness.\u201d</p><p>Arya reacted as he knew she would, \u201cThat\u2019s stupid. You saved\nus, everyone in Westeros. Everyone in the world maybe! And Tyrion likes you\nanyway. It\u2019s impossible not to love you.\u201d It was an exaggeration but a kind one\nand arguing with Arya would get him as far as throwing himself from the saddle.</p><p>\u201cWell kindness or not I appreciate the materials and the\nplans he sent. If this works no one will have to walk to a well to draw water,\nbathing will be easier \u2013 at least for me, privies will stink less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Arya hummed in agreement. \u201cDo you think the design\nfor those crutches will work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I could use them all the time. But they could be\nhelpful, especially when I need to get out of my chair. Or to piss.\u201d</p><p>Arya doubled over laughing, \u201cI don\u2019t believe a great lord is\nsupposed to talk about pissing in front of a lady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I seem to recall you preferring honesty to\nprudishness.\u201d</p><p>They rode closer to the castle. Once the great gray walls\nwould have loomed ahead of them, but now most of the masonry lay scattered\nabout the fields where the dead had deposited them when they tore the walls\napart. At least most of the keep had been spared the same treatment though the\ncastle had already been in ill repair thanks to the Boltons. </p><p>Those who had survived the war had spent the remainder of\nthe winter huddled in the few buildings or parts of buildings that had\nsurvived. Over time shacks, lean-tos, and huts had been built about the space\nbut Bran had chosen to put an end to it now that the North had recovered\nenough. They had food to spare at last, thanks in part to the irrigation system\nhe\u2019d devised, and there were men who needed work. Neither Bran nor any of the\nother residents of Winterfell desired to endure another of the newly short\nwinters trapped in the same few rooms.</p><p><i>Before</i> Bran had\nknown Winterfell better than anyone and that would be true again and seeing his\nhome in ruins had been almost comforting, knowing that it was only broken \u2013\nlike him. \u201cIt\u2019s odd you know\u201d he started, breaking the long silence, \u201cI\u2019ve\nalways thought of myself as being part of Winterfell, or Winterfell being part\nof me. When it was burned and broken it felt almost right because I\u2019m broken \u2013\u201d\nhe held up a hand for silence, \u201c\u2013 You know what I mean. Now the castle will be\nrebuilt entirely, or mostly that is. But that cannot happen for me.\u201d</p><p>Arya thought over his words, chewing on her lip\nabsentmindedly. \u201cAre you referring to your legs or your or something else\nBran?\u201d she asked at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part of you can\u2019t be fixed? Your legs? Or your\nheart?\u201d</p><p>Bran stared, \u201cWell my legs obviously can\u2019t be healed. I\u2019ve\nlearned that over and again. But my\u2026 mind.

It would be selfish of me to ask her to come here\nfor my own comfort, because I\u2019m lonely and I can\u2019t sleep without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d shared a bed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was too cold to sleep apart beyond the Wall. When she\nwas here it was just a habit, for warmth and yes for comfort but I never\ntouched her if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>Arya grinned at him, \u201cBut if you never touched then how\ncould you share warmth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Bran snapped; he was blushing\nfuriously. \u201cI didn\u2019t take her maidenhead or anything of the sort.\u201d</p><p>His sister could not let the matter drop though, she was\nstill grinning madly. She loved to tease him, and if he was honest with himself\nBran didn\u2019t mind his sister\u2019s cajoling so much. It was too good to be able to\nlaugh and smile and joke again without the dreadful weight of sadness always\nhanging about. It had taken years for them to let their ghosts go. Arya\ncontinued her prodding, \u201cBut you want to. You want her maidenhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need Meera\u2019s maidenhead. I would sleep better if\nshe were with me \u2013 I\u2019d feel more\u201d he was silent for a moment, searching for the\nright word \u201cwhole, happy. But I cannot ask her to leave her mother and her home\nand her duty for my own selfish reasons.\u201d </p><p>They paused in their ride to watch another group of workers\nemerging from the wolfswood, leading teams of horses that were pulling great\ntrees behind them.

Another one of the odd duties her husband\nhad been tasked with to give him something to do outside the forge.</p><p>Bran sighed \u2013 wistfully, Arya thought \u2013 \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll wed.\nIf she\u2019ll have me that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have asked for her hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany times.
