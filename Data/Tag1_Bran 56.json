        "body": "<h2>A \u201cVery Potter Musical\u201d theory<br/></h2><p>Okay, no I did not lose my mind. This is not a Very Potter Musical theory but it discusses some similarities between Harry Potter and Game of Thrones and ends with a little help from Spotify. By writing this down I prove I have learned nothing from my past mistake of interpeting the questionable plot twists in BBC Sherlock through an optimistic perspective. I need to get it out though and I\u2019ll just hope I won\u2019t get too disappointed in the next episodes. Please keep in mind that opinions and preferences amongst GoT fans vary greatly - who is important or evil in my opinion might not be for you.\u00a0</p><p>This is a long post, so here\u2019s a summary of what is discussed:\u00a0</p><ul><li><b>Review of the Long Night</b></li><li><b>Many parallels between Bran Stark and Harry Potter. Bran is a (dark) grey character in this theory.\u00a0</b></li><li><b>Arya\u2019s importance and whether she is the promised one or not</b></li><li><b>Personal predictions about the next episodes. All main characters are discussed. Might or might not contain wishful thinking. A whole lot about the prophecy of Azor Ahai which I REALLY want to see fulfilled <i>properly</i> before the show ends.\u00a0</b></li><li><b>Clues from the Spotify Game of Thrones Playlist D&amp;D created for the ending of the show</b></li><li><b>Some noticeable emphasis on Jaime and Brienne. A LOT of Jaime.</b></li></ul><!-- more --><p>First of all, I belong to the few (?) who loved the episode. I doubt any other TV show will ever manage to achieve anything remotely as ambitious. The cinematography is gorgeous, the actors, the crew, the visual effects, the music&hellip; everyone who took part in the making of this episode needs a standing ovation. As for the darkness? It meant to be this way! The darkness was what kept us on edge and it made it harder to understand if a character was dying or not, thus stressing us out even more. The darkness was meant to reinforce the feeling of uncertainty and imminent danger. Whereas Helm\u2019s Deep battle was lit to emphasize on the heroism and the stunts, the battle of Winterfell is darkened to emphasize on its unpredictability and the feeling of death lurking in every corner. So it is unfair to rate this episode with 1s or 2s like so many people do. Even if you didn\u2019t like the ending, there are so many elements here and so much hard work that deserve acknowledgement.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like everything though. What did I not like? Well, duh, the ending. I was never interested in the whole\u00a0\u201cWhite Walkers\u201d part of the plot and yet Arya killing the Night King in seconds didn\u2019t exactly satisfy even the indifferent me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like Arya and she sure is one of the most lethal characters. It just never occurred to me that she could be connected to this particular subplot. The thing, however, that I interpret very differently than most people writing reviews is that to me there was nothing final about this episode. Many fans act as if this was the general ending of the story and I don\u2019t want to be too optimistic but I just don\u2019t see it this way. So what then? Are we going to watch Cersei sip wine for the next four and a half hours until Drogon roasts her in the last second? Are they THAT bad? The fact that the characters in the show consider the Dead their greatest threat does not mean that this is the culmination of the plot. Let alone that the fact that the characters think the threat is gone does not mean the threat is gone. Remember the show we\u2019re watching - the shocking plot twists always happen when you least expect them. If D&amp;D have now become cowards, we must wait until the end to be able to tell. I, for one, consider the fact that they have not left even a mere second, even a still image, even a comment or a sentence about the last three episodes slip as extremely promising. Even the promo for the next episode is literally two scenes and obviously the least important. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to defend them too much because this has been a boomerang for me in the past <b>*cough sherlock cough*</b>.</p><p>According to what we got, most have assumed that Bran was the ultimate good guy who had orchestrated everything so Arya, Azor Ahai, would kill the Night King.\u00a0 My main argument is that Bran Stark&hellip;just doesn\u2019t strike me like an *entirely* good guy. I know people have had enough of Bran is the Villain theories but I am not speaking about a full-blown villain and also&hellip;just consider it for a bit. The Three-Eyed-Raven is supposedly the eternal enemy of the Night King and is a wise entity. There is a problem in Bran\u2019s case though: the Night King leaves his mark on him.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"625\" data-orig-height=\"395\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b785e2363bbeddba26e461fb913b0c6/tumblr_inline_pqu3a854Vz1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"625\" data-orig-height=\"395\"/></figure><p>Don\u2019t forget, the Night King is known to create wights simply by touching\u00a0 them. Craster\u2019s living babies. Bloody (though dead) Viserion! The intelligence or the living state of the victim doesn\u2019t seem to be an obstacle. The Night King then assumes complete control over his creations.</p><p>\u00a0Do you know what this mark reminds me of?\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8ab9b3f8f15b7d8e951e9675924eeb6/tumblr_inline_pqqwrfaNzN1tgbnyl_400.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"300\"/></figure><p>This.\u00a0</p><p>Voldemort tried to kill Harry but his curse turned back at him because Lily had just died to save her child (because of love). It left a scar on Harry\u2019s forehead instead of killing him. What happened between Bran and the Night King seems very similar. The Night King wanted to kill or turn into a wight the soon-to-be Third Eyed Raven so he grabbed him by the wrist but Bran wasn\u2019t exactly there so there was an obstacle the Night King couldn\u2019t fully overcome. Bran escapes him and returns to the present with a mark. We\u2019re told that this mark can help the Night King find him. Is this all there is to it though?\u00a0</p><p>It takes five years for Dumbledore to brace himself and reveal to Harry why his scar is a sensor of Voldemort\u2019s presence and extreme mood shifts. The reason is that the day Voldemort tried to kill Harry a part of his already ruined soul was merged with Harry\u2019s soul which made them both have access to each other\u2019s feelings and thoughts to some degree. As time passed, that connection became stronger, especially as Harry and Voldemort became aware of it. By his fifth year in Hogwarts, Harry\u2019s mood is constantly affected by Voldemort\u2019s; he\u2019s often angry and full of inexplicable hate. He laughs and gets furious and has violent urges all of a sudden without understanding why. He starts getting visions where he <i>is</i> Voldemort.\u00a0 The good thing in Harry\u2019s case is that Harry\u2019s soul is a pure whole soul that can\u2019t get easily corrupted and that some powerful people know about this connection more or less and try to guard him against it (Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius etc).</p><p>If something similar happens to Bran, he is not that lucky. Nobody understands this connection except maybe the previous Third Eyed Raven who is dead. What\u2019s worse, Bran does not only fight against the Night King\u2019s effect on him. Whereas Harry\u2019s soul was pure and healthy and whole, Bran\u2019s soul and identity collapses under the weight of partly being both the Night King (or controlled by him) and the Third Eyed Raven. His mind fills with the memory and the wisdom of the world as well as with the awareness of the intent of death. Obviously, little Brandon Stark\u2019s emotional and mental world doesn\u2019t even make up 1% of the whole consciousness there is now inside him.\u00a0</p><p>As the Night King gets more powerful day after day, we see an evolution in Bran Stark as well. As the story proceeds, he becomes more and more emotionless and lifeless just like Harry was getting more irritable, envious and violent. Bran starts resembling a dead man. It does not help that the Third Eyed Raven has a pretty neutral stance as well but young Bran suspiciously beats the much older previous Third Eyed Raven in terms of neutrality. When he returns to Winterfell, he has already lost all his feelings for his family. Maybe Bran is still in there but only a last lost hint of him that needs something groundbreaking to happen to cause him to externalize some emotion.\u00a0</p><p>Another proof that Bran has a more special connection with the Night King than just being tracked down by him is offered to us when a panicked marked Bran (when he still could feel) argues with the Third Eyed Raven that the Night King can\u2019t get to him in that sacred place to which the wise entity responds laconically:\u00a0 \u201c<i>He can now</i>\u201d. Well, if the mark was just a track medium then the Night King would get stuck in the opening of the cave, aware that Bran is inside yet unable to enter. If he can now get in, this possibly means he is already in, protected by being carried by an innocent, still pure and very much alive being; Bran. The Night King is inside and thus the wights can now follow him there.\u00a0</p><p>Dumbledore thought it was too cruel to reveal to poor Harry that the only way they could completely kill Voldemort was to kill him too.\u00a0 Aaaand Dumbledore thought it was important that Voldemort killed them both himself. The only difference here is that Bran is both the equivalents of Harry and Dumbledore in one body, so Bran himself was the one who knew what had to be done.\u00a0</p><p>When they are discussing the battle strategy, Bran tells everyone the Night King wants to kill him because he wants to erase the memory of this world.\u00a0Despite this, Bran requires to be left outside in plain sight so that the Night King will find him and everyone assumes he wants to be the bait, something Bran neither confirms nor denies. But what if he wanted to be the sacrifice instead of the bait? Think about it, Bran\u2019s plan makes the Night King supposedly more vulnerable but it also makes the Third Eyed Raven way easier to kill. If Bran waits for him in the open, it\u2019s very easy for the Night King to reach him quickly with the dragon and if he does, then all the living die anyway! If Bran was in the crypts, the Night King would have a much longer way to go into the castle, thus having to confront many more living that could hopefully take him down. Honestly, Bran\u2019s plan just makes the Night King\u2019s job easier.\u00a0 Moreover, Bran does not ask protection. Theon takes the initiative and swears to protect him and Bran once again says nothing because he doesn\u2019t want to cause disagreements and end up protected in the crypts or with a more skilled fighter to guard him. At this moment Bran realises Theon is about to die for his cause and he allows it to happen for either the greater good or the greater evil. Bran says he doesn\u2019t know if dragon fire can kill the Night King because nobody has tried, therefore making Jon and Daenerys waste all their contribution at trying to take him out in this way. When Daenerys dracarys at him, the Night King shows human traits and smiles sinisterly at her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"675\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3004f32b83e52be6a0b9f9bdbe3d52a/tumblr_inline_pqu4mhYN8y1tgbnyl_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"675\"/></figure><p><i>Hehe, tricked ya!</i> Has he ever displayed so particular human reactions before?</p><p>\n\nIn short, I believe Bran wanted to die in this battle. What\u2019s questionable is Bran\u2019s allegiances. Does Bran want to die to save everyone else or to ensure the Night King\u2019s plan is successful? I tend to believe the answer is&hellip;both. The Raven inside him wants the Night King to fail but Night King\u2019s consiousness inside him wants him to succeed. Either way Bran must die. However, I think currently the Night King\u2019s will inside Bran is winning because Bran would try to pass on somebody else his gift before sacrificing himself. Another question is, is Bran totally honest? What if the Night King&rsquo;s actual plan was to resurrect him or merge with him after killing him which as a result would mean that the Night King would become the Third Eyed Raven, accumulating enormous god-like power?\u00a0</p><p>Arya prevented Bran\u2019s plan whether his intent was good or bad. With this reasoning, Arya is not Azor Ahai because either she delayed the salvation of the living or she didn\u2019t completely beat the \u201cFinal Boss\u201d. Of course, there are problems in this theory. Why did Bran want to save himself in the past, why did he not head alone in the north to find the Night King first and end this without so much mayhem? Also, what about Arya and the dagger he gave her?</p><p>Possible answers:\u00a0</p><ol><li>Bran\u2019s high consciousness as well as his connection to the Night King get stronger minute after minute. It might have taken him some time to process what he needed or wanted to do and how he would achieve it.\u00a0</li><li>Well, he is a boy in a wheelchair. Nobody will let him just go find the Night King. He can\u2019t escape their notice. Before this, Meera would never agree to take him north obviously.</li><li>The dagger thing is the hardest. Can we still assume there is a limit to what Bran knows and can predict? He doesn\u2019t know everything. I think at this point I believe there is truly a God in the ASOIAF world and it seems he has a design for this world indeed. Bran might be more powerful than a regular person but he still is a tool in the divine plan. Besides, upon planning the tactics for the battle, Bran does not seem exactly sure of the outcome. Bran seems to know vaguely who is important but he does not know exactly <i>how</i>. Perhaps Three Eyed Raven Bran sensed Arya was meant to have that dagger but he didn\u2019t know yet what for and whether it would benefit his Night King side or not. Furthermore, back then the Night King\u2019s effect on him was weaker so that Bran was a better entity than he is now.\u00a0<br/></li></ol><p>Now let\u2019s talk about the actual battle. When Melisandre sets the trench on fire, Theon seals his death by telling Bran that the fire is lit and the wights can not proceed (and therefore reach to them). Then - oh so coincidentally - Bran is like\u00a0\u201cOK thanx Theon gotta go now bye\u201d. He then wargs into ravens and he leads them straight to the Night King. The ravens reach him and <b>then and only then </b>the Night King commands the wights to fall in the fire and create a bridge for the rest to cross. We see this on screen clearly so I wonder why people don\u2019t talk about it at all. I would make a gif but it\u2019s too damn dark! (Taking back all good words I said for the darkness lol). In short, Bran gets close to the Night King and sets him into action. Bran betrays them all. Is this a necessary evil for the greater good or just plain evil? Almost everyone was slaughtered after this, so I doubt Bran didn\u2019t want to be in the crypts so more people would survive&hellip;bullshit. (Of course, all these apply if we blindly accept that the battle strategy was not just badly written.)</p><p>A similar scene happens in the seventh season when Bran wargs ravens to spy on the Dead and although they all are motionless, standing corpses, when the ravens arrive the Night King abruptly jumps to&hellip;errr&hellip;life and looks at them as if fully aware it\u2019s Bran inside them. This terrifies Bran but also probably allows him to learn about the special nature of his connection with him.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49f7f1981360df9ead5aaf6427f4e5c4/tumblr_inline_pqsa4rPQs31tgbnyl_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\"/></figure><p>In Dragonstone, the first episode of the seventh season, the second scene is the dead marching South and the scene cuts to Bran warging while Meera drags him to the Wall.\u00a0</p><p>Back in the Long Night, Bran stays at warg state throughout the whole battle after this point.\u00a0Now look&hellip; if you can.

Therefore, Bran does not need to guide him anymore. He returns to himself and thanks Theon essentially for dying for nothing. However, Theon serves his purpose, delaying Bran\u2019s death until Arya arrives. Then he dies betrayed, paying for his betrayal of Robb Stark. Bran then waits passively for the Night King to kill him. Their interaction is basically all but hateful. The Night King just stares at him with something close to content in his face, while Bran looks&hellip;happy?\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"692\" data-orig-height=\"389\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/945010ce1ea151cb6ffd35f1ec0e1b70/tumblr_inline_pquoq4BbeJ1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"692\" data-orig-height=\"389\"/></figure><p>This is Bran\u2019s happy face.

Look at Bran. He doesn&rsquo;t look at the least bit happy or grateful. His - granted - blank expression somehow shows me he was thinking &ldquo;How the fuck do I undo this now?&rdquo;. Look at Arya smiling at him after they are all saved and Bran\u2019s reaction.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"485\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5a112c5ad9e2b3cbb924845eb99e113/tumblr_inline_pqsb5fQfv71tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"485\" data-orig-height=\"347\"/></figure><p><i>You\u2019re safe now, brother!</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"449\" data-orig-height=\"302\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe8561c232945a352d3c05529814c051/tumblr_inline_pqsb7wfA5y1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"449\" data-orig-height=\"302\"/></figure><p><i>Yeah, I am so happy right now I could cut you with the dagger I gave you..\u00a0</i></p><p>For an extremely expressionless face, I feel like Bran is probably screaming internally here. Tell me, does he look happier with the Night King or Arya?!</p><p>Let\u2019s focus on Arya now. As a start, Arya does not fit any of the criteria for Azor Ahai except maybe the first one (Braavos&rsquo; water dance fight style and strong connection of the city with water???). She hasn&rsquo;t killed a Lannister-lion yet and the Nissa Nissa thing makes the probabilities even slimmer. Furthermore, she doesn&rsquo;t kill the Night King with her Needle but with a dagger instead. No fire, no red colour, nothing. Actually, we see her repeatedly asking Gendry to make her the weapon. We\u2019ve therefore been told that Arya won\u2019t have her sword so she doesn&rsquo;t have a Lightbringer either. Three swords get a lot of mentions in the show: the Needle which Arya did not use at all throughout the battle (she literally uses every possible weapon except the Needle), Heartsbane which Sam gives to Jorah who then falls and Oathkeeper which Jaime gives to Brienne as a token of his love. </p><p>Arya was not Azor Ahai but she still functioned according to the God&rsquo;s plan. The God (whoever he is, the old, the 7, the Lord of Light or the Many-faced one) doesn\u2019t want the memory of this world to be lost. What perhaps Bran had not thought (or did not want) is that he should not die until he passed his gift to someone else. If Bran&rsquo;s plan worked, the world as everyone knew it would change forever.  When Bran explains what he is now to everyone, Sam interferes and says they should never let him die. Someone must be the Third Eyed Raven so that the humans will keep being exactly that - humans with history, backgrounds and memories. Here we might be getting the answer about why on earth Sam did not die in the battle. Sam understands better than anyone the importance of this entity. This might hint that he is going to become the Third Eyed Raven once Bran dies or contribute to find the chosen one. The archmaester in the Citadel told Sam something similar:\u00a0\u201c<i>We are the memory of this world.</i>\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>So, things were not going according to plan and also the real Azor Ahai had not showed up yet thus Arya was meant to save the day. Everything Arya did led up to this. She was filled with hate when her father was executed by Joffrey so that she would find the most skilled assassins to train her for revenge. Arya prepares the way for Azor Ahai. Beric was brought up to life to save Arya. The Hound was not killed by Brienne or Arya in order to then save the latter. The Hound most likely has more to do in the story (face Mountain) which is why Beric dies and Sandor does not.</p><p>Let\u2019s go to the plot armour. Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei and Varys. During the battle, something of utmost importance happens in the crypts. Sansa plants an idea in Tyrion&rsquo;s mind - Daenerys is the obstacle in their way to be a couple. What&rsquo;s next; clever Tyrion will once again be the victim of a woman who promised him love and this is how Daenerys will be betrayed for love, fulfilling the prophecy. Tywin always admitted Tyrion&rsquo;s intelligence but despised him for being so weak in front of his vices; women and alcohol. Tywin cruelly tried to teach him a lesson twice, first with Tysha and then with Shae. But Tyrion did not pay attention and maybe his ultimate downfall is going to be Sansa. Missandei overheard what they said and she is still loyal to Daenerys. Tyrion is in danger. Varys heard them too but he might side with Tyrion. Let&rsquo;s see if mighty Tywin was cruel but spot on. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Greyworm who has promised to protect Missandei. Missandei is in danger now that Sansa knows she can rush to her Queen and tell her what she heard. Perhaps Greyworm survived so that the truth will reach Deanerys. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing did not save Jorah but he held on enough to protect his Queen . Daenerys loses her last truly unyielding supporter. She is now more powerless than ever. Sansa has the upper hand in the North and if Dany opposes to Jon Snow, her fate seems doomed no matter what Missandei and Greyworm do. Then again, if Sansa finds out about Jon\u2019s heritage, she might start being less friendly too. A cousin starts getting too distant especially when power is involved.\u00a0</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Jon, the heir, whose purpose however was not to defeat the White Walkers. His purpose was to tell the world of their existence or he might have a great part to play in the last war.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Tormund, Jaime, Brienne and Podrick. Out of all these only Brienne and Tormund naturally make sense to be still alive because of their strength and skill. And then we have one-handed Jaime and Podrick who honestly should have died in the first ten minutes. While everyone else fights for their life, Brienne and Jaime keep constantly saving each other almost like they are in their own world. Podrick surviving is very weird but we have already been shown that the boy has hidden talents. Podrick has not completed his arc.\u00a0</p><p>As for Jaime, Bran told him he shouldn&rsquo;t have him killed before he got to help \u201cthem\u201d. And then the battle comes and he merely survives. Arya&rsquo;s timing saves him (and his love) in the last second. Jaime did nothing important for or against the Night King or Bran yet.  Jaime was trapped in the battle, hardly able to survive let alone reach to Bran. Sure, Jaime killed probably hundreds of wights that night but he didn\u2019t affect the grand scheme of things in this battle like Bran implied. Yet, Bran literally waited for him a whole night out in the dark cold. This must mean we have a lot more to see in the next episodes.\u00a0</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Gendry and Sam but not Edd. Gendry still has a claim to the throne. Edd died so that Sam could live. I already spoke of Sam&rsquo;s importance. But something weird happens when Edd saves Sam. Sam falls down exhausted but something catches his attention. See the gifs in\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\">@nochancennochoice</a> \u2018s <a href=\"https://asherlockstudy.tumblr.com/post/184575306005/joannaoftarth-nochancennochoice-curious#notes\">post</a>: there is some debate on whether Sam sees Brienne, Jaime fighting with his two hands oooor Jaime fighting with a right hand. I think it looks like the third option is the right one and it would explain why confused Sam has a pausing moment in all this mayhem and forgets the world around him until Edd calls him back to reality. Sam sees Jaime through the flames, being in a delirious state, fighting like crazy with what looks like his right hand suspiciously a lot. We can be sure Jaime did not use his non-existent hand though - so could this be a vision in the flames by the Lord of Light&hellip;you know&hellip;a more accurate one than the ones Melisandre sees? Jaime was indeed fighting like crazy but Sam sees a changed image through the fire that puzzles him quite a bit. We\u2019ll soon see if there was hidden importance in this oddly specific scene and, once more, it would explain why Samwell Tarly would survive the long night.</p><p>This does not mean Jaime is definitely the legendary warrior. However, he is the most likely contender in my opinion because a) he leaves his false vile identity in the past inside smoke and water (let\u2019s pretend the baths had salts), b) he indirectly kills a lion, his father, c) he&rsquo;s truly the only character who is basically exclusively driven by love and we know Azor Ahai must make the ultimate sacrifice.  Perhaps though and dreadfully so, Jaime still hasn&rsquo;t killed a lion because his father&rsquo;s murder is not on him. This might be the fulfilment of the Valonqar prophecy and Jaime gets to kill Cersei. At this point the story will have proceeded a lot and Jaime and Brienne will have confessed their love or acted upon it. Jaime has saved Brienne more times than we can count and especially in the first incidents Brienne asks him why, both in the show and the books. Jaime never responds in the show but in the books we see that he has meaningful dreams that lead his way. Jaime was destined to find Brienne, love her and keep her alive. Jaime gives her his sword and Brienne bonds with it so much that it almost already is part of her entity. The last challenge for Azor Ahai is to sacrifice his willing loving wife Nissa Nissa whose soul will become one with the sword and this will create the Lightbringer. It pains me to even think about it but Nissa Nissa doesn&rsquo;t sound like Cersei. Brienne will die so that Jaime can meet his fate. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"1600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d8f1f0e747c153c783e590fe7358141/tumblr_inline_pqsc3trXuX1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"1600\"/></figure><p>Three guesses who. </p><p>After that Jaime and Oathkeeper will end this story by killing Bran. Bran still has a good side in him and it\u2019s probable that he will guide Jaime to do it. I&rsquo;m gonna cheat here with my evidence but this kinda explains why Nikolaj Coster Waldau loves the conclusion of the story but seems kinda sympathetic when Gwendoline Christie says she had trouble processing the end of her character and needed long walks at the beach and such. When asked, Nikolaj probably revealed too much at some point because he said the story is about that good guy Jaime and that Bran boy who sacrificed himself to save the world. Of course, it\u2019s Nik. He might as well be saying what he wants the end to be lol. However&hellip; Bran did not technically sacrifice himself in the Long Night, right? If he knew Arya was coming, then he definitely did not. Either way, the outcome is the same - Bran has not sacrificed himself yet.\u00a0</p><p>Back to Bran and the Night King. People in and out of the show wonder why the wights became so powerful and persistent in this era. Furthermore, the Night King seems much more conscious and lifelike than all the other moving corpses. Maybe we can conclude the explanation with the help of Hodor&rsquo;s backstory.  Everyone kept telling Bran to not lose himself in the visions but he ignored them just like he ignored Catelyn and kept climbing towers. Everyone is paying Bran&rsquo;s disobedience and he is going to pay with his life. When the Third Eyed Raven was asleep, Bran travelled into an indefinite time period and got his mark from the Night King. This might have happened long before Bran was even born or before he got paralysed. Therefore the Night King already was connected to Bran but Bran had to get the mark first to start realising and reinforcing the connection. The connection the Night King has to Bran gives him some glimpses of a human living self which is why he is superior to the wights and the White Walkers and shows rudimentary human logic and sense of purpose and identity. With the same reasoning, it\u2019s only after the mark that Bran loses all emotions and vigor.</p><p>Upon first meeting Jaime, Jaime who is probably Azor Ahai immediately tried to kill Bran. When Catelyn asked him much later why he threw her son out of the window, Jaime did not respond even though soon afterwards he confessed he sleeps with his sister so hiding this was not the reason he did not respond. It was fate that drove Jaime&rsquo;s hand because even though he doesn&rsquo;t know it, Jaime is driven by a force to become the leader against the darkness. Bran did not die from an 100% deadly fall because although it was Jaime who did it, it was not the right time yet because he wasn\u2019t yet reborn as Azor Ahai and the Night King did not yet live through Bran. Bran&rsquo;s first encounter with the fighter of the Lord of Light is the beginning for his journey to meet his destiny and as soon as Jaime cripples him, he starts getting visions that call him to the North. We might say that Jaime sets the evil going in order for good to fight back and prevail. <i>The things I do for love&hellip; </i>Fighting evil?</p><p>And now&hellip;some more evidence about the story can be taken from the spotify playlist that hints at the ending of the show according to D&amp;D. Let\u2019s see the songs in the very end of the list:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"571\" data-orig-height=\"179\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41b1ce7d849b5bb265a13b594b6b41a2/tumblr_inline_pqsctpO1C51tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"571\" data-orig-height=\"179\"/></figure><p>Gold Lion&hellip; In the\u00a0\u201cKnight of the Seven Kingdoms\u201d Tyrion and Jaime reminince on their past \u201cglorious\u201d days when Jaime was a Golden Lion and Tyrion was a whoremonger. Jaime specifically says his golden lion days belong to the past (which is like the most basic foreshadowing of tragic irony) but the playlist disagrees. Here are some lyrics from the song:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>Gold lion&rsquo;s gonna tell me where the light is&hellip;<br/>Tell me what you saw&hellip;<br/>We&rsquo;ll build a fire in your eyes&hellip;</i></p></blockquote><p>If this is not the most ultimate \u201cJaime is Azor Ahai with Lightbringer\u201d evidence, I don\u2019t know what is.\u00a0</p><p>Then we have Here\u2019s Your Future, which is a song in which God basically is considered responsible for burdening his children with sin.

This really sounds like the Lord of Light so I do believe we\u2019re going to have Azor Ahai by the end of the show. It is very similar to the concept of Jaime being destined to be depraved only to be led in the way of atonement, redemption and then glory. Melisandre and all sorts of God faith have been given a huge part to be totally meaningless.\u00a0</p><p>Since I mentioned Melisandre, she was meant to die. Maybe this was the only vision R\u2019hllor truly had for her; that she should die after this fight in the snow. Why? Ser Davos is the last main character Arya saves repeatedly. Ser Davos and Melisandre\u2019s fates have been interwined for long even though they hate each other. Ser Davos witnesses her suicide. Why did Melisandre have to die, in terms of fate? Maybe because, from now on, there aren\u2019t going to be any resurrections. Whoever dies, dies. Why did they change the plot so that Melisandre would need a magical necklace to stay alive?\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"219\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gameofcostumes:jEtcCHbAt_ghRqKAEoUMjw:ZoONga2htO5z0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e31cb1e9a197a671ab7a0cdf3a6fc965/tumblr_pqquyfcEVf1x95fyzo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"219\"/></figure><p>Maybe because only one character will have the chance to defy death from now on. Chances are it will be a woman. Why is Ser Davos who literally can\u2019t fight still alive all those years? Maybe because he saw Melisandre drop the necklace and then age and die rapidly. Davos will keep the necklace and probably save a woman he deems worthy of a second chance in life.\u00a0</p><p>And then of course\u00a0\u201cLove is Blindness\u201d. There are only two couples this could apply to; Jaime and Brienne and Tyrion and Sansa but I\u2019m positive Sansa only wants to use Tyrion to weaken Daenerys and fight Cersei. So the only truly fitting love story is that of Jaime and Brienne.<br/></p><p>As if all this was not wishful thinking&hellip;imagine Brienne sacrificing herself, Jaime becoming a heartbroken Azor Ahai and the ever surviving Davos putting the necklace around her neck, to the one he seemed to be so appreciative and fond of back in the fireplace&hellip;</p><p>Okay, okay aren\u2019t all theories partly what we wish it happens? It\u2019s perfectly reasonable if you find this way too much, way too complicated, way too wishful and subjective. If there\u2019s something in here that makes sense to you, you can take this and leave all the rest. I am aware I completely dismissed some basic characters. Let\u2019s say something short about them: Daenerys in my opinion won\u2019t make it to the throne. Not only that but she\u2019s going to be one of the first main characters to die. Even next episode seems probable to me. Arya soon will have her arc completed. I think she reached the peak of her importance. Of all the Starks, I think Sansa is the one who has a chance for the Iron Throne somehow. Right now, she is the most competent in the game of thrones. Littlefinger lives through her. She has admitted to admiring Cersei. One Stark will survive because there must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I honestly have no idea what will happen to Jon Snow. Everyone is sure he\u2019s Azor Ahai but actually there is no evidence the Prince who was Promised and Azor Ahai are the same person. Targaryen heritage is only mentioned in the PWWP prophecy, not that of Azor Ahai. Nevertheless, Jon literally prays to die again. I don\u2019t know if I feel content with the idea of him sitting on the Iron Throne and being depressed all his life because of it.\u00a0</p><p>Cersei of course will die. Tyrion won\u2019t be the one to do it. I would hate it if Arya was the one to do it by wearing one of the brothers\u2019 face. It would be so emotionally anti-climactic and Arya already had her huge killing moment however in the Spotify list there is a song named \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d under the \u201cKiller Wolf\u201d one. God forbid. I hope she uses her skills to someone other than a Lannister because there is also an extremely disturbing and explicit song which is named\u00a0\u201cSister\u201d and guess what, the rather problematic lyrics are about a young boy who slept with his much older sister who is&hellip;nuts.</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI was only sixteen but I guess that&rsquo;s no excuse\n\n<br/></i></p><p><i>\n\nOh, sister<br/>Don&rsquo;t put me on the street again<br/>Oh, sister<br/>I just want to be your friend\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>These were the most tolerable lyrics. (Wtf Prince?) I mean, the point of the song in the list is pretty clear. Jaime will meet Cersei once more and let\u2019s hope he\u2019ll kill her for ruining 20+ years of his life. Right now, Jaime doesn\u2019t look particularly interested in Cersei. It seems as if everything regarding her has died inside him. Therefore, something will happen that will fill Jaime with wrath. The scenarios are two:\u00a0</p><ol><li>Bronn kills Tyrion.\u00a0</li><li>Bronn tries to kill Jaime, Brienne defends him and falls.\u00a0</li></ol><p>Both heartbreaking possibilities (although admit it, they are awesome in terms of dramaturgy). Both are terrifying to me but my desperation makes me wish for the first option. The fact that Bronn said in the fifth season that he does not kill women really DOES NOT help. However, if Brienne is Nissa Nissa then Brienne will die after Cersei so Bronn might indeed kill Tyrion. Besides, Nissa Nissa\u2019s sacrifice could also have some figurative meaning instead of foreseeing a literal death.</p><p>All these of course are just personal speculations and wishes. Cersei might be Nissa Nissa. Or Arya might have indeed been Azor Ahai. Jaime and Brienne might just live happily ever after (without Davos\u2019 help) or Jaime might fall heroically. Daenerys might live and rule. Bran maybe is an awesome dude.\u00a0</p><p>I will just say that judging from the way the eighth season is structured, I think D&amp;D played a little game. They featured the huge, foretold battle in the third episode. If the heroes of the whole story were also the heroes of this episode (Arya, Bran, Melisandre) then perhaps it would be wiser if this episode was the fifth or at least the fourth. We are still not exactly in the middle of the season since the total duration of the last three episodes is going to be longer. So if this was the decisive turn of the plot, why would it be featured in the first half of the season? Furthermore, D&amp;D promoted the third episode beyond belief while they kept the next episodes entirely in the dark. That\u2019s got to mean something. Hopefully, D&amp;D planned to create huge expectations for the third episode, therefore not allowing the viewers to build defenses for what would happen next. They tried to satisfy those expectations for the third episode with the exceptional cinematography, direction, music and unprecedented ominous atmosphere they created. This could potentially be the most important deviation from Martin\u2019s future version, in which the Long Night might indeed be the prophecised event that would make Azor Ahai rise and most main characters die. D&amp;D though want the show to be as unpredictable as possible and they have an Iron Throne to give which might mean they used the Long Night as a distraction, however epic.\u00a0</p>",

A LOT of Jaime.</b></li></ul>[[MORE]]<p>First of all, I belong to the few (?) who loved the episode. I doubt any other TV show will ever manage to achieve anything remotely as ambitious. The cinematography is gorgeous, the actors, the crew, the visual effects, the music\u2026 everyone who took part in the making of this episode needs a standing ovation. As for the darkness? It meant to be this way! The darkness was what kept us on edge and it made it harder to understand if a character was dying or not, thus stressing us out even more. The darkness was meant to reinforce the feeling of uncertainty and imminent danger. Whereas Helm\u2019s Deep battle was lit to emphasize on the heroism and the stunts, the battle of Winterfell is darkened to emphasize on its unpredictability and the feeling of death lurking in every corner. So it is unfair to rate this episode with 1s or 2s like so many people do. Even if you didn\u2019t like the ending, there are so many elements here and so much hard work that deserve acknowledgement.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like everything though. What did I not like? Well, duh, the ending. I was never interested in the whole\u00a0\u201cWhite Walkers\u201d part of the plot and yet Arya killing the Night King in seconds didn\u2019t exactly satisfy even the indifferent me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like Arya and she sure is one of the most lethal characters. It just never occurred to me that she could be connected to this particular subplot. The thing, however, that I interpret very differently than most people writing reviews is that to me there was nothing final about this episode. Many fans act as if this was the general ending of the story and I don\u2019t want to be too optimistic but I just don\u2019t see it this way. So what then? Are we going to watch Cersei sip wine for the next four and a half hours until Drogon roasts her in the last second? Are they THAT bad? The fact that the characters in the show consider the Dead their greatest threat does not mean that this is the culmination of the plot. Let alone that the fact that the characters think the threat is gone does not mean the threat is gone. Remember the show we\u2019re watching - the shocking plot twists always happen when you least expect them. If D&amp;D have now become cowards, we must wait until the end to be able to tell. I, for one, consider the fact that they have not left even a mere second, even a still image, even a comment or a sentence about the last three episodes slip as extremely promising. Even the promo for the next episode is literally two scenes and obviously the least important. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to defend them too much because this has been a boomerang for me in the past <b>*cough sherlock cough*</b>.</p><p>According to what we got, most have assumed that Bran was the ultimate good guy who had orchestrated everything so Arya, Azor Ahai, would kill the Night King.\u00a0 My main argument is that Bran Stark\u2026just doesn\u2019t strike me like an *entirely* good guy. I know people have had enough of Bran is the Villain theories but I am not speaking about a full-blown villain and also\u2026just consider it for a bit. The Three-Eyed-Raven is supposedly the eternal enemy of the Night King and is a wise entity. There is a problem in Bran\u2019s case though: the Night King leaves his mark on him.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"625\" data-orig-height=\"395\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b785e2363bbeddba26e461fb913b0c6/tumblr_inline_pqu3a854Vz1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"625\" data-orig-height=\"395\"></figure><p>Don\u2019t forget, the Night King is known to create wights simply by touching\u00a0 them. Craster\u2019s living babies. Bloody (though dead) Viserion! The intelligence or the living state of the victim doesn\u2019t seem to be an obstacle. The Night King then assumes complete control over his creations.</p><p>\u00a0Do you know what this mark reminds me of?\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8ab9b3f8f15b7d8e951e9675924eeb6/tumblr_inline_pqqwrfaNzN1tgbnyl_400.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"300\"></figure><p>This.\u00a0</p><p>Voldemort tried to kill Harry but his curse turned back at him because Lily had just died to save her child (because of love). It left a scar on Harry\u2019s forehead instead of killing him. What happened between Bran and the Night King seems very similar. The Night King wanted to kill or turn into a wight the soon-to-be Third Eyed Raven so he grabbed him by the wrist but Bran wasn\u2019t exactly there so there was an obstacle the Night King couldn\u2019t fully overcome. Bran escapes him and returns to the present with a mark. We\u2019re told that this mark can help the Night King find him. Is this all there is to it though?\u00a0</p><p>It takes five years for Dumbledore to brace himself and reveal to Harry why his scar is a sensor of Voldemort\u2019s presence and extreme mood shifts. The reason is that the day Voldemort tried to kill Harry a part of his already ruined soul was merged with Harry\u2019s soul which made them both have access to each other\u2019s feelings and thoughts to some degree. As time passed, that connection became stronger, especially as Harry and Voldemort became aware of it. By his fifth year in Hogwarts, Harry\u2019s mood is constantly affected by Voldemort\u2019s; he\u2019s often angry and full of inexplicable hate. He laughs and gets furious and has violent urges all of a sudden without understanding why. He starts getting visions where he <i>is</i> Voldemort.\u00a0 The good thing in Harry\u2019s case is that Harry\u2019s soul is a pure whole soul that can\u2019t get easily corrupted and that some powerful people know about this connection more or less and try to guard him against it (Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius etc).</p><p>If something similar happens to Bran, he is not that lucky. Nobody understands this connection except maybe the previous Third Eyed Raven who is dead. What\u2019s worse, Bran does not only fight against the Night King\u2019s effect on him. Whereas Harry\u2019s soul was pure and healthy and whole, Bran\u2019s soul and identity collapses under the weight of partly being both the Night King (or controlled by him) and the Third Eyed Raven. His mind fills with the memory and the wisdom of the world as well as with the awareness of the intent of death. Obviously, little Brandon Stark\u2019s emotional and mental world doesn\u2019t even make up 1% of the whole consciousness there is now inside him.\u00a0</p><p>As the Night King gets more powerful day after day, we see an evolution in Bran Stark as well. As the story proceeds, he becomes more and more emotionless and lifeless just like Harry was getting more irritable, envious and violent. Bran starts resembling a dead man. It does not help that the Third Eyed Raven has a pretty neutral stance as well but young Bran suspiciously beats the much older previous Third Eyed Raven in terms of neutrality. When he returns to Winterfell, he has already lost all his feelings for his family. Maybe Bran is still in there but only a last lost hint of him that needs something groundbreaking to happen to cause him to externalize some emotion.\u00a0</p><p>Another proof that Bran has a more special connection with the Night King than just being tracked down by him is offered to us when a panicked marked Bran (when he still could feel) argues with the Third Eyed Raven that the Night King can\u2019t get to him in that sacred place to which the wise entity responds laconically:\u00a0 \u201c<i>He can now</i>\u201d. Well, if the mark was just a track medium then the Night King would get stuck in the opening of the cave, aware that Bran is inside yet unable to enter. If he can now get in, this possibly means he is already in, protected by being carried by an innocent, still pure and very much alive being; Bran. The Night King is inside and thus the wights can now follow him there.\u00a0</p><p>Dumbledore thought it was too cruel to reveal to poor Harry that the only way they could completely kill Voldemort was to kill him too.\u00a0 Aaaand Dumbledore thought it was important that Voldemort killed them both himself. The only difference here is that Bran is both the equivalents of Harry and Dumbledore in one body, so Bran himself was the one who knew what had to be done.\u00a0</p><p>When they are discussing the battle strategy, Bran tells everyone the Night King wants to kill him because he wants to erase the memory of this world.\u00a0Despite this, Bran requires to be left outside in plain sight so that the Night King will find him and everyone assumes he wants to be the bait, something Bran neither confirms nor denies. But what if he wanted to be the sacrifice instead of the bait? Think about it, Bran\u2019s plan makes the Night King supposedly more vulnerable but it also makes the Third Eyed Raven way easier to kill. If Bran waits for him in the open, it\u2019s very easy for the Night King to reach him quickly with the dragon and if he does, then all the living die anyway! If Bran was in the crypts, the Night King would have a much longer way to go into the castle, thus having to confront many more living that could hopefully take him down. Honestly, Bran\u2019s plan just makes the Night King\u2019s job easier.\u00a0 Moreover, Bran does not ask protection. Theon takes the initiative and swears to protect him and Bran once again says nothing because he doesn\u2019t want to cause disagreements and end up protected in the crypts or with a more skilled fighter to guard him. At this moment Bran realises Theon is about to die for his cause and he allows it to happen for either the greater good or the greater evil. Bran says he doesn\u2019t know if dragon fire can kill the Night King because nobody has tried, therefore making Jon and Daenerys waste all their contribution at trying to take him out in this way. When Daenerys dracarys at him, the Night King shows human traits and smiles sinisterly at her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"675\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3004f32b83e52be6a0b9f9bdbe3d52a/tumblr_inline_pqu4mhYN8y1tgbnyl_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"675\"></figure><p><i>Hehe, tricked ya!</i> Has he ever displayed so particular human reactions before?</p><p>\n\nIn short, I believe Bran wanted to die in this battle. What\u2019s questionable is Bran\u2019s allegiances. Does Bran want to die to save everyone else or to ensure the Night King\u2019s plan is successful? I tend to believe the answer is\u2026both. The Raven inside him wants the Night King to fail but Night King\u2019s consiousness inside him wants him to succeed. Either way Bran must die. However, I think currently the Night King\u2019s will inside Bran is winning because Bran would try to pass on somebody else his gift before sacrificing himself. Another question is, is Bran totally honest? What if the Night King\u2019s actual plan was to resurrect him or merge with him after killing him which as a result would mean that the Night King would become the Third Eyed Raven, accumulating enormous god-like power?\u00a0</p><p>Arya prevented Bran\u2019s plan whether his intent was good or bad. With this reasoning, Arya is not Azor Ahai because either she delayed the salvation of the living or she didn\u2019t completely beat the \u201cFinal Boss\u201d. Of course, there are problems in this theory. Why did Bran want to save himself in the past, why did he not head alone in the north to find the Night King first and end this without so much mayhem? Also, what about Arya and the dagger he gave her?</p><p>Possible answers:\u00a0</p><ol><li>Bran\u2019s high consciousness as well as his connection to the Night King get stronger minute after minute. It might have taken him some time to process what he needed or wanted to do and how he would achieve it.\u00a0</li><li>Well, he is a boy in a wheelchair. Nobody will let him just go find the Night King. He can\u2019t escape their notice. Before this, Meera would never agree to take him north obviously.</li><li>The dagger thing is the hardest. Can we still assume there is a limit to what Bran knows and can predict? He doesn\u2019t know everything. I think at this point I believe there is truly a God in the ASOIAF world and it seems he has a design for this world indeed. Bran might be more powerful than a regular person but he still is a tool in the divine plan. Besides, upon planning the tactics for the battle, Bran does not seem exactly sure of the outcome. Bran seems to know vaguely who is important but he does not know exactly <i>how</i>. Perhaps Three Eyed Raven Bran sensed Arya was meant to have that dagger but he didn\u2019t know yet what for and whether it would benefit his Night King side or not. Furthermore, back then the Night King\u2019s effect on him was weaker so that Bran was a better entity than he is now.\u00a0<br></li></ol><p>Now let\u2019s talk about the actual battle. When Melisandre sets the trench on fire, Theon seals his death by telling Bran that the fire is lit and the wights can not proceed (and therefore reach to them). Then - oh so coincidentally - Bran is like\u00a0\u201cOK thanx Theon gotta go now bye\u201d. He then wargs into ravens and he leads them straight to the Night King. The ravens reach him and <b>then and only then </b>the Night King commands the wights to fall in the fire and create a bridge for the rest to cross. We see this on screen clearly so I wonder why people don\u2019t talk about it at all. I would make a gif but it\u2019s too damn dark! (Taking back all good words I said for the darkness lol). In short, Bran gets close to the Night King and sets him into action. Bran betrays them all. Is this a necessary evil for the greater good or just plain evil? Almost everyone was slaughtered after this, so I doubt Bran didn\u2019t want to be in the crypts so more people would survive\u2026bullshit. (Of course, all these apply if we blindly accept that the battle strategy was not just badly written.)</p><p>A similar scene happens in the seventh season when Bran wargs ravens to spy on the Dead and although they all are motionless, standing corpses, when the ravens arrive the Night King abruptly jumps to\u2026errr\u2026life and looks at them as if fully aware it\u2019s Bran inside them. This terrifies Bran but also probably allows him to learn about the special nature of his connection with him.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49f7f1981360df9ead5aaf6427f4e5c4/tumblr_inline_pqsa4rPQs31tgbnyl_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\"></figure><p>In Dragonstone, the first episode of the seventh season, the second scene is the dead marching South and the scene cuts to Bran warging while Meera drags him to the Wall.\u00a0</p><p>Back in the Long Night, Bran stays at warg state throughout the whole battle after this point.\u00a0Now look\u2026 if you can.

Therefore, Bran does not need to guide him anymore. He returns to himself and thanks Theon essentially for dying for nothing. However, Theon serves his purpose, delaying Bran\u2019s death until Arya arrives. Then he dies betrayed, paying for his betrayal of Robb Stark. Bran then waits passively for the Night King to kill him. Their interaction is basically all but hateful. The Night King just stares at him with something close to content in his face, while Bran looks\u2026happy?\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"692\" data-orig-height=\"389\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/945010ce1ea151cb6ffd35f1ec0e1b70/tumblr_inline_pquoq4BbeJ1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"692\" data-orig-height=\"389\"></figure><p>This is Bran\u2019s happy face.

Look at Bran. He doesn\u2019t look at the least bit happy or grateful. His - granted - blank expression somehow shows me he was thinking \u201cHow the fuck do I undo this now?\u201d. Look at Arya smiling at him after they are all saved and Bran\u2019s reaction.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"485\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5a112c5ad9e2b3cbb924845eb99e113/tumblr_inline_pqsb5fQfv71tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"485\" data-orig-height=\"347\"></figure><p><i>You\u2019re safe now, brother!</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"449\" data-orig-height=\"302\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe8561c232945a352d3c05529814c051/tumblr_inline_pqsb7wfA5y1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"449\" data-orig-height=\"302\"></figure><p><i>Yeah, I am so happy right now I could cut you with the dagger I gave you..\u00a0</i></p><p>For an extremely expressionless face, I feel like Bran is probably screaming internally here. Tell me, does he look happier with the Night King or Arya?!</p><p>Let\u2019s focus on Arya now. As a start, Arya does not fit any of the criteria for Azor Ahai except maybe the first one (Braavos\u2019 water dance fight style and strong connection of the city with water???). She hasn\u2019t killed a Lannister-lion yet and the Nissa Nissa thing makes the probabilities even slimmer. Furthermore, she doesn\u2019t kill the Night King with her Needle but with a dagger instead. No fire, no red colour, nothing. Actually, we see her repeatedly asking Gendry to make her the weapon. We\u2019ve therefore been told that Arya won\u2019t have her sword so she doesn\u2019t have a Lightbringer either. Three swords get a lot of mentions in the show: the Needle which Arya did not use at all throughout the battle (she literally uses every possible weapon except the Needle), Heartsbane which Sam gives to Jorah who then falls and Oathkeeper which Jaime gives to Brienne as a token of his love. </p><p>Arya was not Azor Ahai but she still functioned according to the God\u2019s plan. The God (whoever he is, the old, the 7, the Lord of Light or the Many-faced one) doesn\u2019t want the memory of this world to be lost. What perhaps Bran had not thought (or did not want) is that he should not die until he passed his gift to someone else. If Bran\u2019s plan worked, the world as everyone knew it would change forever.  When Bran explains what he is now to everyone, Sam interferes and says they should never let him die. Someone must be the Third Eyed Raven so that the humans will keep being exactly that - humans with history, backgrounds and memories. Here we might be getting the answer about why on earth Sam did not die in the battle. Sam understands better than anyone the importance of this entity. This might hint that he is going to become the Third Eyed Raven once Bran dies or contribute to find the chosen one. The archmaester in the Citadel told Sam something similar:\u00a0\u201c<i>We are the memory of this world.</i>\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>So, things were not going according to plan and also the real Azor Ahai had not showed up yet thus Arya was meant to save the day. Everything Arya did led up to this. She was filled with hate when her father was executed by Joffrey so that she would find the most skilled assassins to train her for revenge. Arya prepares the way for Azor Ahai. Beric was brought up to life to save Arya. The Hound was not killed by Brienne or Arya in order to then save the latter. The Hound most likely has more to do in the story (face Mountain) which is why Beric dies and Sandor does not.</p><p>Let\u2019s go to the plot armour. Arya\u2019s timing saves Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei and Varys. During the battle, something of utmost importance happens in the crypts. Sansa plants an idea in Tyrion\u2019s mind - Daenerys is the obstacle in their way to be a couple. What\u2019s next; clever Tyrion will once again be the victim of a woman who promised him love and this is how Daenerys will be betrayed for love, fulfilling the prophecy. Tywin always admitted Tyrion\u2019s intelligence but despised him for being so weak in front of his vices; women and alcohol. Tywin cruelly tried to teach him a lesson twice, first with Tysha and then with Shae. But Tyrion did not pay attention and maybe his ultimate downfall is going to be Sansa. Missandei overheard what they said and she is still loyal to Daenerys. Tyrion is in danger. Varys heard them too but he might side with Tyrion. Let\u2019s see if mighty Tywin was cruel but spot on. </p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Greyworm who has promised to protect Missandei. Missandei is in danger now that Sansa knows she can rush to her Queen and tell her what she heard. Perhaps Greyworm survived so that the truth will reach Deanerys. </p><p>Arya\u2019s timing did not save Jorah but he held on enough to protect his Queen . Daenerys loses her last truly unyielding supporter. She is now more powerless than ever. Sansa has the upper hand in the North and if Dany opposes to Jon Snow, her fate seems doomed no matter what Missandei and Greyworm do. Then again, if Sansa finds out about Jon\u2019s heritage, she might start being less friendly too. A cousin starts getting too distant especially when power is involved.\u00a0</p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Jon, the heir, whose purpose however was not to defeat the White Walkers. His purpose was to tell the world of their existence or he might have a great part to play in the last war.\u00a0<br></p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Tormund, Jaime, Brienne and Podrick. Out of all these only Brienne and Tormund naturally make sense to be still alive because of their strength and skill. And then we have one-handed Jaime and Podrick who honestly should have died in the first ten minutes. While everyone else fights for their life, Brienne and Jaime keep constantly saving each other almost like they are in their own world. Podrick surviving is very weird but we have already been shown that the boy has hidden talents. Podrick has not completed his arc.\u00a0</p><p>As for Jaime, Bran told him he shouldn\u2019t have him killed before he got to help \u201cthem\u201d. And then the battle comes and he merely survives. Arya\u2019s timing saves him (and his love) in the last second. Jaime did nothing important for or against the Night King or Bran yet.  Jaime was trapped in the battle, hardly able to survive let alone reach to Bran. Sure, Jaime killed probably hundreds of wights that night but he didn\u2019t affect the grand scheme of things in this battle like Bran implied. Yet, Bran literally waited for him a whole night out in the dark cold. This must mean we have a lot more to see in the next episodes.\u00a0</p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Gendry and Sam but not Edd. Gendry still has a claim to the throne. Edd died so that Sam could live. I already spoke of Sam\u2019s importance. But something weird happens when Edd saves Sam. Sam falls down exhausted but something catches his attention. See the gifs in\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\">@nochancennochoice</a> \u2018s <a href=\"https://asherlockstudy.tumblr.com/post/184575306005/joannaoftarth-nochancennochoice-curious#notes\">post</a>: there is some debate on whether Sam sees Brienne, Jaime fighting with his two hands oooor Jaime fighting with a right hand. I think it looks like the third option is the right one and it would explain why confused Sam has a pausing moment in all this mayhem and forgets the world around him until Edd calls him back to reality. Sam sees Jaime through the flames, being in a delirious state, fighting like crazy with what looks like his right hand suspiciously a lot. We can be sure Jaime did not use his non-existent hand though - so could this be a vision in the flames by the Lord of Light\u2026you know\u2026a more accurate one than the ones Melisandre sees? Jaime was indeed fighting like crazy but Sam sees a changed image through the fire that puzzles him quite a bit. We\u2019ll soon see if there was hidden importance in this oddly specific scene and, once more, it would explain why Samwell Tarly would survive the long night.</p><p>This does not mean Jaime is definitely the legendary warrior. However, he is the most likely contender in my opinion because a) he leaves his false vile identity in the past inside smoke and water (let\u2019s pretend the baths had salts), b) he indirectly kills a lion, his father, c) he\u2019s truly the only character who is basically exclusively driven by love and we know Azor Ahai must make the ultimate sacrifice.  Perhaps though and dreadfully so, Jaime still hasn\u2019t killed a lion because his father\u2019s murder is not on him. This might be the fulfilment of the Valonqar prophecy and Jaime gets to kill Cersei. At this point the story will have proceeded a lot and Jaime and Brienne will have confessed their love or acted upon it. Jaime has saved Brienne more times than we can count and especially in the first incidents Brienne asks him why, both in the show and the books. Jaime never responds in the show but in the books we see that he has meaningful dreams that lead his way. Jaime was destined to find Brienne, love her and keep her alive. Jaime gives her his sword and Brienne bonds with it so much that it almost already is part of her entity. The last challenge for Azor Ahai is to sacrifice his willing loving wife Nissa Nissa whose soul will become one with the sword and this will create the Lightbringer. It pains me to even think about it but Nissa Nissa doesn\u2019t sound like Cersei. Brienne will die so that Jaime can meet his fate. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"1600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d8f1f0e747c153c783e590fe7358141/tumblr_inline_pqsc3trXuX1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"1600\"></figure><p>Three guesses who. </p><p>After that Jaime and Oathkeeper will end this story by killing Bran. Bran still has a good side in him and it\u2019s probable that he will guide Jaime to do it. I\u2019m gonna cheat here with my evidence but this kinda explains why Nikolaj Coster Waldau loves the conclusion of the story but seems kinda sympathetic when Gwendoline Christie says she had trouble processing the end of her character and needed long walks at the beach and such. When asked, Nikolaj probably revealed too much at some point because he said the story is about that good guy Jaime and that Bran boy who sacrificed himself to save the world. Of course, it\u2019s Nik. He might as well be saying what he wants the end to be lol. However\u2026 Bran did not technically sacrifice himself in the Long Night, right? If he knew Arya was coming, then he definitely did not. Either way, the outcome is the same - Bran has not sacrificed himself yet.\u00a0</p><p>Back to Bran and the Night King. People in and out of the show wonder why the wights became so powerful and persistent in this era. Furthermore, the Night King seems much more conscious and lifelike than all the other moving corpses. Maybe we can conclude the explanation with the help of Hodor\u2019s backstory.  Everyone kept telling Bran to not lose himself in the visions but he ignored them just like he ignored Catelyn and kept climbing towers. Everyone is paying Bran\u2019s disobedience and he is going to pay with his life. When the Third Eyed Raven was asleep, Bran travelled into an indefinite time period and got his mark from the Night King. This might have happened long before Bran was even born or before he got paralysed. Therefore the Night King already was connected to Bran but Bran had to get the mark first to start realising and reinforcing the connection. The connection the Night King has to Bran gives him some glimpses of a human living self which is why he is superior to the wights and the White Walkers and shows rudimentary human logic and sense of purpose and identity. With the same reasoning, it\u2019s only after the mark that Bran loses all emotions and vigor.</p><p>Upon first meeting Jaime, Jaime who is probably Azor Ahai immediately tried to kill Bran. When Catelyn asked him much later why he threw her son out of the window, Jaime did not respond even though soon afterwards he confessed he sleeps with his sister so hiding this was not the reason he did not respond. It was fate that drove Jaime\u2019s hand because even though he doesn\u2019t know it, Jaime is driven by a force to become the leader against the darkness. Bran did not die from an 100% deadly fall because although it was Jaime who did it, it was not the right time yet because he wasn\u2019t yet reborn as Azor Ahai and the Night King did not yet live through Bran. Bran\u2019s first encounter with the fighter of the Lord of Light is the beginning for his journey to meet his destiny and as soon as Jaime cripples him, he starts getting visions that call him to the North. We might say that Jaime sets the evil going in order for good to fight back and prevail. <i>The things I do for love\u2026 </i>Fighting evil?</p><p>And now\u2026some more evidence about the story can be taken from the spotify playlist that hints at the ending of the show according to D&amp;D. Let\u2019s see the songs in the very end of the list:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"571\" data-orig-height=\"179\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41b1ce7d849b5bb265a13b594b6b41a2/tumblr_inline_pqsctpO1C51tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"571\" data-orig-height=\"179\"></figure><p>Gold Lion\u2026 In the\u00a0\u201cKnight of the Seven Kingdoms\u201d Tyrion and Jaime reminince on their past \u201cglorious\u201d days when Jaime was a Golden Lion and Tyrion was a whoremonger. Jaime specifically says his golden lion days belong to the past (which is like the most basic foreshadowing of tragic irony) but the playlist disagrees. Here are some lyrics from the song:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>Gold lion\u2019s gonna tell me where the light is\u2026<br>Tell me what you saw\u2026<br>We\u2019ll build a fire in your eyes\u2026</i></p></blockquote><p>If this is not the most ultimate \u201cJaime is Azor Ahai with Lightbringer\u201d evidence, I don\u2019t know what is.\u00a0</p><p>Then we have Here\u2019s Your Future, which is a song in which God basically is considered responsible for burdening his children with sin. God forces them to sin so that the duty of atoning and cleansing the world falls on them in order to get worthy of\u00a0 the future God has prepared for them. This really sounds like the Lord of Light so I do believe we\u2019re going to have Azor Ahai by the end of the show. It is very similar to the concept of Jaime being destined to be depraved only to be led in the way of atonement, redemption and then glory. Melisandre and all sorts of God faith have been given a huge part to be totally meaningless.\u00a0</p><p>Since I mentioned Melisandre, she was meant to die. Maybe this was the only vision R\u2019hllor truly had for her; that she should die after this fight in the snow. Why? Ser Davos is the last main character Arya saves repeatedly. Ser Davos and Melisandre\u2019s fates have been interwined for long even though they hate each other. Ser Davos witnesses her suicide. Why did Melisandre have to die, in terms of fate? Maybe because, from now on, there aren\u2019t going to be any resurrections. Whoever dies, dies. Why did they change the plot so that Melisandre would need a magical necklace to stay alive?\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"219\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gameofcostumes:jEtcCHbAt_ghRqKAEoUMjw:ZoONga2htO5z0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e31cb1e9a197a671ab7a0cdf3a6fc965/tumblr_pqquyfcEVf1x95fyzo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"219\"></figure><p>Maybe because only one character will have the chance to defy death from now on. Chances are it will be a woman. Why is Ser Davos who literally can\u2019t fight still alive all those years? Maybe because he saw Melisandre drop the necklace and then age and die rapidly. Davos will keep the necklace and probably save a woman he deems worthy of a second chance in life.\u00a0</p><p>And then of course\u00a0\u201cLove is Blindness\u201d. There are only two couples this could apply to; Jaime and Brienne and Tyrion and Sansa but I\u2019m positive Sansa only wants to use Tyrion to weaken Daenerys and fight Cersei. So the only truly fitting love story is that of Jaime and Brienne.<br></p><p>As if all this was not wishful thinking\u2026imagine Brienne sacrificing herself, Jaime becoming a heartbroken Azor Ahai and the ever surviving Davos putting the necklace around her neck, to the one he seemed to be so appreciative and fond of back in the fireplace\u2026</p><p>Okay, okay aren\u2019t all theories partly what we wish it happens? It\u2019s perfectly reasonable if you find this way too much, way too complicated, way too wishful and subjective. If there\u2019s something in here that makes sense to you, you can take this and leave all the rest. I am aware I completely dismissed some basic characters. Let\u2019s say something short about them: Daenerys in my opinion won\u2019t make it to the throne. Not only that but she\u2019s going to be one of the first main characters to die. Even next episode seems probable to me. Arya soon will have her arc completed. I think she reached the peak of her importance. Of all the Starks, I think Sansa is the one who has a chance for the Iron Throne somehow. Right now, she is the most competent in the game of thrones. Littlefinger lives through her. She has admitted to admiring Cersei. One Stark will survive because there must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I honestly have no idea what will happen to Jon Snow. Everyone is sure he\u2019s Azor Ahai but actually there is no evidence the Prince who was Promised and Azor Ahai are the same person. Targaryen heritage is only mentioned in the PWWP prophecy, not that of Azor Ahai. Nevertheless, Jon literally prays to die again. I don\u2019t know if I feel content with the idea of him sitting on the Iron Throne and being depressed all his life because of it.\u00a0</p><p>Cersei of course will die. Tyrion won\u2019t be the one to do it. I would hate it if Arya was the one to do it by wearing one of the brothers\u2019 face. It would be so emotionally anti-climactic and Arya already had her huge killing moment however in the Spotify list there is a song named \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d under the \u201cKiller Wolf\u201d one. God forbid. I hope she uses her skills to someone other than a Lannister because there is also an extremely disturbing and explicit song which is named\u00a0\u201cSister\u201d and guess what, the rather problematic lyrics are about a young boy who slept with his much older sister who is\u2026nuts.</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI was only sixteen but I guess that\u2019s no excuse\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>\n\nOh, sister<br>Don\u2019t put me on the street again<br>Oh, sister<br>I just want to be your friend\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>These were the most tolerable lyrics. (Wtf Prince?) I mean, the point of the song in the list is pretty clear. Jaime will meet Cersei once more and let\u2019s hope he\u2019ll kill her for ruining 20+ years of his life. Right now, Jaime doesn\u2019t look particularly interested in Cersei. It seems as if everything regarding her has died inside him. Therefore, something will happen that will fill Jaime with wrath. The scenarios are two:\u00a0</p><ol><li>Bronn kills Tyrion.\u00a0</li><li>Bronn tries to kill Jaime, Brienne defends him and falls.\u00a0</li></ol><p>Both heartbreaking possibilities (although admit it, they are awesome in terms of dramaturgy). Both are terrifying to me but my desperation makes me wish for the first option. The fact that Bronn said in the fifth season that he does not kill women really DOES NOT help. However, if Brienne is Nissa Nissa then Brienne will die after Cersei so Bronn might indeed kill Tyrion. Besides, Nissa Nissa\u2019s sacrifice could also have some figurative meaning instead of foreseeing a literal death.</p><p>All these of course are just personal speculations and wishes. Cersei might be Nissa Nissa. Or Arya might have indeed been Azor Ahai. Jaime and Brienne might just live happily ever after (without Davos\u2019 help) or Jaime might fall heroically. Daenerys might live and rule. Bran maybe is an awesome dude.\u00a0</p><p>I will just say that judging from the way the eighth season is structured, I think D&amp;D played a little game. They featured the huge, foretold battle in the third episode. If the heroes of the whole story were also the heroes of this episode (Arya, Bran, Melisandre) then perhaps it would be wiser if this episode was the fifth or at least the fourth. We are still not exactly in the middle of the season since the total duration of the last three episodes is going to be longer. So if this was the decisive turn of the plot, why would it be featured in the first half of the season? Furthermore, D&amp;D promoted the third episode beyond belief while they kept the next episodes entirely in the dark. That\u2019s got to mean something. Hopefully, D&amp;D planned to create huge expectations for the third episode, therefore not allowing the viewers to build defenses for what would happen next. They tried to satisfy those expectations for the third episode with the exceptional cinematography, direction, music and unprecedented ominous atmosphere they created. This could potentially be the most important deviation from Martin\u2019s future version, in which the Long Night might indeed be the prophecised event that would make Azor Ahai rise and most main characters die. D&amp;D though want the show to be as unpredictable as possible and they have an Iron Throne to give which might mean they used the Long Night as a distraction, however epic.\u00a0</p></p>",

The cinematography is gorgeous, the actors, the crew, the visual effects, the music\u2026 everyone who took part in the making of this episode needs a standing ovation. As for the darkness? It meant to be this way! The darkness was what kept us on edge and it made it harder to understand if a character was dying or not, thus stressing us out even more. The darkness was meant to reinforce the feeling of uncertainty and imminent danger. Whereas Helm\u2019s Deep battle was lit to emphasize on the heroism and the stunts, the battle of Winterfell is darkened to emphasize on its unpredictability and the feeling of death lurking in every corner. So it is unfair to rate this episode with 1s or 2s like so many people do. Even if you didn\u2019t like the ending, there are so many elements here and so much hard work that deserve acknowledgement.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like everything though. What did I not like? Well, duh, the ending. I was never interested in the whole\u00a0\u201cWhite Walkers\u201d part of the plot and yet Arya killing the Night King in seconds didn\u2019t exactly satisfy even the indifferent me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like Arya and she sure is one of the most lethal characters. It just never occurred to me that she could be connected to this particular subplot. The thing, however, that I interpret very differently than most people writing reviews is that to me there was nothing final about this episode. Many fans act as if this was the general ending of the story and I don\u2019t want to be too optimistic but I just don\u2019t see it this way. So what then? Are we going to watch Cersei sip wine for the next four and a half hours until Drogon roasts her in the last second? Are they THAT bad? The fact that the characters in the show consider the Dead their greatest threat does not mean that this is the culmination of the plot. Let alone that the fact that the characters think the threat is gone does not mean the threat is gone. Remember the show we\u2019re watching - the shocking plot twists always happen when you least expect them. If D&amp;D have now become cowards, we must wait until the end to be able to tell. I, for one, consider the fact that they have not left even a mere second, even a still image, even a comment or a sentence about the last three episodes slip as extremely promising. Even the promo for the next episode is literally two scenes and obviously the least important. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to defend them too much because this has been a boomerang for me in the past <b>*cough sherlock cough*</b>.</p><p>According to what we got, most have assumed that Bran was the ultimate good guy who had orchestrated everything so Arya, Azor Ahai, would kill the Night King.\u00a0 My main argument is that Bran Stark\u2026just doesn\u2019t strike me like an *entirely* good guy. I know people have had enough of Bran is the Villain theories but I am not speaking about a full-blown villain and also\u2026just consider it for a bit. The Three-Eyed-Raven is supposedly the eternal enemy of the Night King and is a wise entity. There is a problem in Bran\u2019s case though: the Night King leaves his mark on him.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"625\" data-orig-height=\"395\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b785e2363bbeddba26e461fb913b0c6/tumblr_inline_pqu3a854Vz1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"625\" data-orig-height=\"395\"></figure><p>Don\u2019t forget, the Night King is known to create wights simply by touching\u00a0 them. Craster\u2019s living babies. Bloody (though dead) Viserion! The intelligence or the living state of the victim doesn\u2019t seem to be an obstacle. The Night King then assumes complete control over his creations.</p><p>\u00a0Do you know what this mark reminds me of?\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8ab9b3f8f15b7d8e951e9675924eeb6/tumblr_inline_pqqwrfaNzN1tgbnyl_400.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"300\"></figure><p>This.\u00a0</p><p>Voldemort tried to kill Harry but his curse turned back at him because Lily had just died to save her child (because of love). It left a scar on Harry\u2019s forehead instead of killing him. What happened between Bran and the Night King seems very similar. The Night King wanted to kill or turn into a wight the soon-to-be Third Eyed Raven so he grabbed him by the wrist but Bran wasn\u2019t exactly there so there was an obstacle the Night King couldn\u2019t fully overcome. Bran escapes him and returns to the present with a mark. We\u2019re told that this mark can help the Night King find him. Is this all there is to it though?\u00a0</p><p>It takes five years for Dumbledore to brace himself and reveal to Harry why his scar is a sensor of Voldemort\u2019s presence and extreme mood shifts. The reason is that the day Voldemort tried to kill Harry a part of his already ruined soul was merged with Harry\u2019s soul which made them both have access to each other\u2019s feelings and thoughts to some degree. As time passed, that connection became stronger, especially as Harry and Voldemort became aware of it. By his fifth year in Hogwarts, Harry\u2019s mood is constantly affected by Voldemort\u2019s; he\u2019s often angry and full of inexplicable hate. He laughs and gets furious and has violent urges all of a sudden without understanding why. He starts getting visions where he <i>is</i> Voldemort.\u00a0 The good thing in Harry\u2019s case is that Harry\u2019s soul is a pure whole soul that can\u2019t get easily corrupted and that some powerful people know about this connection more or less and try to guard him against it (Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius etc).</p><p>If something similar happens to Bran, he is not that lucky. Nobody understands this connection except maybe the previous Third Eyed Raven who is dead. What\u2019s worse, Bran does not only fight against the Night King\u2019s effect on him. Whereas Harry\u2019s soul was pure and healthy and whole, Bran\u2019s soul and identity collapses under the weight of partly being both the Night King (or controlled by him) and the Third Eyed Raven. His mind fills with the memory and the wisdom of the world as well as with the awareness of the intent of death. Obviously, little Brandon Stark\u2019s emotional and mental world doesn\u2019t even make up 1% of the whole consciousness there is now inside him.\u00a0</p><p>As the Night King gets more powerful day after day, we see an evolution in Bran Stark as well. As the story proceeds, he becomes more and more emotionless and lifeless just like Harry was getting more irritable, envious and violent. Bran starts resembling a dead man. It does not help that the Third Eyed Raven has a pretty neutral stance as well but young Bran suspiciously beats the much older previous Third Eyed Raven in terms of neutrality. When he returns to Winterfell, he has already lost all his feelings for his family. Maybe Bran is still in there but only a last lost hint of him that needs something groundbreaking to happen to cause him to externalize some emotion.\u00a0</p><p>Another proof that Bran has a more special connection with the Night King than just being tracked down by him is offered to us when a panicked marked Bran (when he still could feel) argues with the Third Eyed Raven that the Night King can\u2019t get to him in that sacred place to which the wise entity responds laconically:\u00a0 \u201c<i>He can now</i>\u201d. Well, if the mark was just a track medium then the Night King would get stuck in the opening of the cave, aware that Bran is inside yet unable to enter. If he can now get in, this possibly means he is already in, protected by being carried by an innocent, still pure and very much alive being; Bran. The Night King is inside and thus the wights can now follow him there.\u00a0</p><p>Dumbledore thought it was too cruel to reveal to poor Harry that the only way they could completely kill Voldemort was to kill him too.\u00a0 Aaaand Dumbledore thought it was important that Voldemort killed them both himself. The only difference here is that Bran is both the equivalents of Harry and Dumbledore in one body, so Bran himself was the one who knew what had to be done.\u00a0</p><p>When they are discussing the battle strategy, Bran tells everyone the Night King wants to kill him because he wants to erase the memory of this world.\u00a0Despite this, Bran requires to be left outside in plain sight so that the Night King will find him and everyone assumes he wants to be the bait, something Bran neither confirms nor denies. But what if he wanted to be the sacrifice instead of the bait? Think about it, Bran\u2019s plan makes the Night King supposedly more vulnerable but it also makes the Third Eyed Raven way easier to kill. If Bran waits for him in the open, it\u2019s very easy for the Night King to reach him quickly with the dragon and if he does, then all the living die anyway! If Bran was in the crypts, the Night King would have a much longer way to go into the castle, thus having to confront many more living that could hopefully take him down. Honestly, Bran\u2019s plan just makes the Night King\u2019s job easier.\u00a0 Moreover, Bran does not ask protection. Theon takes the initiative and swears to protect him and Bran once again says nothing because he doesn\u2019t want to cause disagreements and end up protected in the crypts or with a more skilled fighter to guard him. At this moment Bran realises Theon is about to die for his cause and he allows it to happen for either the greater good or the greater evil. Bran says he doesn\u2019t know if dragon fire can kill the Night King because nobody has tried, therefore making Jon and Daenerys waste all their contribution at trying to take him out in this way. When Daenerys dracarys at him, the Night King shows human traits and smiles sinisterly at her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"675\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3004f32b83e52be6a0b9f9bdbe3d52a/tumblr_inline_pqu4mhYN8y1tgbnyl_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"675\"></figure><p><i>Hehe, tricked ya!</i> Has he ever displayed so particular human reactions before?</p><p>\n\nIn short, I believe Bran wanted to die in this battle. What\u2019s questionable is Bran\u2019s allegiances. Does Bran want to die to save everyone else or to ensure the Night King\u2019s plan is successful? I tend to believe the answer is\u2026both. The Raven inside him wants the Night King to fail but Night King\u2019s consiousness inside him wants him to succeed. Either way Bran must die. However, I think currently the Night King\u2019s will inside Bran is winning because Bran would try to pass on somebody else his gift before sacrificing himself. Another question is, is Bran totally honest? What if the Night King\u2019s actual plan was to resurrect him or merge with him after killing him which as a result would mean that the Night King would become the Third Eyed Raven, accumulating enormous god-like power?\u00a0</p><p>Arya prevented Bran\u2019s plan whether his intent was good or bad. With this reasoning, Arya is not Azor Ahai because either she delayed the salvation of the living or she didn\u2019t completely beat the \u201cFinal Boss\u201d. Of course, there are problems in this theory. Why did Bran want to save himself in the past, why did he not head alone in the north to find the Night King first and end this without so much mayhem? Also, what about Arya and the dagger he gave her?</p><p>Possible answers:\u00a0</p><ol><li>Bran\u2019s high consciousness as well as his connection to the Night King get stronger minute after minute. It might have taken him some time to process what he needed or wanted to do and how he would achieve it.\u00a0</li><li>Well, he is a boy in a wheelchair. Nobody will let him just go find the Night King. He can\u2019t escape their notice. Before this, Meera would never agree to take him north obviously.</li><li>The dagger thing is the hardest. Can we still assume there is a limit to what Bran knows and can predict? He doesn\u2019t know everything. I think at this point I believe there is truly a God in the ASOIAF world and it seems he has a design for this world indeed. Bran might be more powerful than a regular person but he still is a tool in the divine plan. Besides, upon planning the tactics for the battle, Bran does not seem exactly sure of the outcome. Bran seems to know vaguely who is important but he does not know exactly <i>how</i>. Perhaps Three Eyed Raven Bran sensed Arya was meant to have that dagger but he didn\u2019t know yet what for and whether it would benefit his Night King side or not. Furthermore, back then the Night King\u2019s effect on him was weaker so that Bran was a better entity than he is now.\u00a0<br></li></ol><p>Now let\u2019s talk about the actual battle. When Melisandre sets the trench on fire, Theon seals his death by telling Bran that the fire is lit and the wights can not proceed (and therefore reach to them). Then - oh so coincidentally - Bran is like\u00a0\u201cOK thanx Theon gotta go now bye\u201d. He then wargs into ravens and he leads them straight to the Night King. The ravens reach him and <b>then and only then </b>the Night King commands the wights to fall in the fire and create a bridge for the rest to cross. We see this on screen clearly so I wonder why people don\u2019t talk about it at all. I would make a gif but it\u2019s too damn dark! (Taking back all good words I said for the darkness lol). In short, Bran gets close to the Night King and sets him into action. Bran betrays them all. Is this a necessary evil for the greater good or just plain evil? Almost everyone was slaughtered after this, so I doubt Bran didn\u2019t want to be in the crypts so more people would survive\u2026bullshit. (Of course, all these apply if we blindly accept that the battle strategy was not just badly written.)</p><p>A similar scene happens in the seventh season when Bran wargs ravens to spy on the Dead and although they all are motionless, standing corpses, when the ravens arrive the Night King abruptly jumps to\u2026errr\u2026life and looks at them as if fully aware it\u2019s Bran inside them. This terrifies Bran but also probably allows him to learn about the special nature of his connection with him.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49f7f1981360df9ead5aaf6427f4e5c4/tumblr_inline_pqsa4rPQs31tgbnyl_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"344\"></figure><p>In Dragonstone, the first episode of the seventh season, the second scene is the dead marching South and the scene cuts to Bran warging while Meera drags him to the Wall.\u00a0</p><p>Back in the Long Night, Bran stays at warg state throughout the whole battle after this point.\u00a0Now look\u2026 if you can. Apologies for terrible quality.\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"453\" data-orig-height=\"309\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0eee87d4eee5e6e2e626f7a06adf0259/tumblr_inline_pqsazdgXVo1tgbnyl_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"453\" data-orig-height=\"309\"></figure><p>Bran never leaves his warg state until the exact moment the Night King arrives and has direct eye contact with him. Therefore, Bran does not need to guide him anymore. He returns to himself and thanks Theon essentially for dying for nothing. However, Theon serves his purpose, delaying Bran\u2019s death until Arya arrives. Then he dies betrayed, paying for his betrayal of Robb Stark. Bran then waits passively for the Night King to kill him. Their interaction is basically all but hateful. The Night King just stares at him with something close to content in his face, while Bran looks\u2026happy?\u00a0\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"692\" data-orig-height=\"389\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/945010ce1ea151cb6ffd35f1ec0e1b70/tumblr_inline_pquoq4BbeJ1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"692\" data-orig-height=\"389\"></figure><p>This is Bran\u2019s happy face.

Look at Bran. He doesn\u2019t look at the least bit happy or grateful. His - granted - blank expression somehow shows me he was thinking \u201cHow the fuck do I undo this now?\u201d. Look at Arya smiling at him after they are all saved and Bran\u2019s reaction.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"485\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5a112c5ad9e2b3cbb924845eb99e113/tumblr_inline_pqsb5fQfv71tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"485\" data-orig-height=\"347\"></figure><p><i>You\u2019re safe now, brother!</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"449\" data-orig-height=\"302\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe8561c232945a352d3c05529814c051/tumblr_inline_pqsb7wfA5y1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"449\" data-orig-height=\"302\"></figure><p><i>Yeah, I am so happy right now I could cut you with the dagger I gave you..\u00a0</i></p><p>For an extremely expressionless face, I feel like Bran is probably screaming internally here. Tell me, does he look happier with the Night King or Arya?!</p><p>Let\u2019s focus on Arya now. As a start, Arya does not fit any of the criteria for Azor Ahai except maybe the first one (Braavos\u2019 water dance fight style and strong connection of the city with water???). She hasn\u2019t killed a Lannister-lion yet and the Nissa Nissa thing makes the probabilities even slimmer. Furthermore, she doesn\u2019t kill the Night King with her Needle but with a dagger instead. No fire, no red colour, nothing. Actually, we see her repeatedly asking Gendry to make her the weapon. We\u2019ve therefore been told that Arya won\u2019t have her sword so she doesn\u2019t have a Lightbringer either. Three swords get a lot of mentions in the show: the Needle which Arya did not use at all throughout the battle (she literally uses every possible weapon except the Needle), Heartsbane which Sam gives to Jorah who then falls and Oathkeeper which Jaime gives to Brienne as a token of his love. </p><p>Arya was not Azor Ahai but she still functioned according to the God\u2019s plan. The God (whoever he is, the old, the 7, the Lord of Light or the Many-faced one) doesn\u2019t want the memory of this world to be lost. What perhaps Bran had not thought (or did not want) is that he should not die until he passed his gift to someone else. If Bran\u2019s plan worked, the world as everyone knew it would change forever.  When Bran explains what he is now to everyone, Sam interferes and says they should never let him die. Someone must be the Third Eyed Raven so that the humans will keep being exactly that - humans with history, backgrounds and memories. Here we might be getting the answer about why on earth Sam did not die in the battle. Sam understands better than anyone the importance of this entity. This might hint that he is going to become the Third Eyed Raven once Bran dies or contribute to find the chosen one. The archmaester in the Citadel told Sam something similar:\u00a0\u201c<i>We are the memory of this world.</i>\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>So, things were not going according to plan and also the real Azor Ahai had not showed up yet thus Arya was meant to save the day. Everything Arya did led up to this. She was filled with hate when her father was executed by Joffrey so that she would find the most skilled assassins to train her for revenge. Arya prepares the way for Azor Ahai. Beric was brought up to life to save Arya. The Hound was not killed by Brienne or Arya in order to then save the latter. The Hound most likely has more to do in the story (face Mountain) which is why Beric dies and Sandor does not.</p><p>Let\u2019s go to the plot armour. Arya\u2019s timing saves Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei and Varys. During the battle, something of utmost importance happens in the crypts. Sansa plants an idea in Tyrion\u2019s mind - Daenerys is the obstacle in their way to be a couple. What\u2019s next; clever Tyrion will once again be the victim of a woman who promised him love and this is how Daenerys will be betrayed for love, fulfilling the prophecy. Tywin always admitted Tyrion\u2019s intelligence but despised him for being so weak in front of his vices; women and alcohol. Tywin cruelly tried to teach him a lesson twice, first with Tysha and then with Shae. But Tyrion did not pay attention and maybe his ultimate downfall is going to be Sansa. Missandei overheard what they said and she is still loyal to Daenerys. Tyrion is in danger. Varys heard them too but he might side with Tyrion. Let\u2019s see if mighty Tywin was cruel but spot on. </p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Greyworm who has promised to protect Missandei. Missandei is in danger now that Sansa knows she can rush to her Queen and tell her what she heard. Perhaps Greyworm survived so that the truth will reach Deanerys. </p><p>Arya\u2019s timing did not save Jorah but he held on enough to protect his Queen . Daenerys loses her last truly unyielding supporter. She is now more powerless than ever. Sansa has the upper hand in the North and if Dany opposes to Jon Snow, her fate seems doomed no matter what Missandei and Greyworm do. Then again, if Sansa finds out about Jon\u2019s heritage, she might start being less friendly too. A cousin starts getting too distant especially when power is involved.\u00a0</p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Jon, the heir, whose purpose however was not to defeat the White Walkers. His purpose was to tell the world of their existence or he might have a great part to play in the last war.\u00a0<br></p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Tormund, Jaime, Brienne and Podrick. Out of all these only Brienne and Tormund naturally make sense to be still alive because of their strength and skill. And then we have one-handed Jaime and Podrick who honestly should have died in the first ten minutes. While everyone else fights for their life, Brienne and Jaime keep constantly saving each other almost like they are in their own world. Podrick surviving is very weird but we have already been shown that the boy has hidden talents. Podrick has not completed his arc.\u00a0</p><p>As for Jaime, Bran told him he shouldn\u2019t have him killed before he got to help \u201cthem\u201d. And then the battle comes and he merely survives. Arya\u2019s timing saves him (and his love) in the last second. Jaime did nothing important for or against the Night King or Bran yet.  Jaime was trapped in the battle, hardly able to survive let alone reach to Bran. Sure, Jaime killed probably hundreds of wights that night but he didn\u2019t affect the grand scheme of things in this battle like Bran implied. Yet, Bran literally waited for him a whole night out in the dark cold. This must mean we have a lot more to see in the next episodes.\u00a0</p><p>Arya\u2019s timing saves Gendry and Sam but not Edd. Gendry still has a claim to the throne. Edd died so that Sam could live. I already spoke of Sam\u2019s importance. But something weird happens when Edd saves Sam. Sam falls down exhausted but something catches his attention. See the gifs in\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\">@nochancennochoice</a> \u2018s <a href=\"https://asherlockstudy.tumblr.com/post/184575306005/joannaoftarth-nochancennochoice-curious#notes\">post</a>: there is some debate on whether Sam sees Brienne, Jaime fighting with his two hands oooor Jaime fighting with a right hand. I think it looks like the third option is the right one and it would explain why confused Sam has a pausing moment in all this mayhem and forgets the world around him until Edd calls him back to reality. Sam sees Jaime through the flames, being in a delirious state, fighting like crazy with what looks like his right hand suspiciously a lot. We can be sure Jaime did not use his non-existent hand though - so could this be a vision in the flames by the Lord of Light\u2026you know\u2026a more accurate one than the ones Melisandre sees? Jaime was indeed fighting like crazy but Sam sees a changed image through the fire that puzzles him quite a bit. We\u2019ll soon see if there was hidden importance in this oddly specific scene and, once more, it would explain why Samwell Tarly would survive the long night.</p><p>This does not mean Jaime is definitely the legendary warrior. However, he is the most likely contender in my opinion because a) he leaves his false vile identity in the past inside smoke and water (let\u2019s pretend the baths had salts), b) he indirectly kills a lion, his father, c) he\u2019s truly the only character who is basically exclusively driven by love and we know Azor Ahai must make the ultimate sacrifice.  Perhaps though and dreadfully so, Jaime still hasn\u2019t killed a lion because his father\u2019s murder is not on him. This might be the fulfilment of the Valonqar prophecy and Jaime gets to kill Cersei. At this point the story will have proceeded a lot and Jaime and Brienne will have confessed their love or acted upon it. Jaime has saved Brienne more times than we can count and especially in the first incidents Brienne asks him why, both in the show and the books. Jaime never responds in the show but in the books we see that he has meaningful dreams that lead his way. Jaime was destined to find Brienne, love her and keep her alive. Jaime gives her his sword and Brienne bonds with it so much that it almost already is part of her entity. The last challenge for Azor Ahai is to sacrifice his willing loving wife Nissa Nissa whose soul will become one with the sword and this will create the Lightbringer. It pains me to even think about it but Nissa Nissa doesn\u2019t sound like Cersei. Brienne will die so that Jaime can meet his fate. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"1600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d8f1f0e747c153c783e590fe7358141/tumblr_inline_pqsc3trXuX1tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"1600\"></figure><p>Three guesses who. </p><p>After that Jaime and Oathkeeper will end this story by killing Bran. Bran still has a good side in him and it\u2019s probable that he will guide Jaime to do it. I\u2019m gonna cheat here with my evidence but this kinda explains why Nikolaj Coster Waldau loves the conclusion of the story but seems kinda sympathetic when Gwendoline Christie says she had trouble processing the end of her character and needed long walks at the beach and such. When asked, Nikolaj probably revealed too much at some point because he said the story is about that good guy Jaime and that Bran boy who sacrificed himself to save the world. Of course, it\u2019s Nik. He might as well be saying what he wants the end to be lol. However\u2026 Bran did not technically sacrifice himself in the Long Night, right? If he knew Arya was coming, then he definitely did not. Either way, the outcome is the same - Bran has not sacrificed himself yet.\u00a0</p><p>Back to Bran and the Night King. People in and out of the show wonder why the wights became so powerful and persistent in this era. Furthermore, the Night King seems much more conscious and lifelike than all the other moving corpses. Maybe we can conclude the explanation with the help of Hodor\u2019s backstory.  Everyone kept telling Bran to not lose himself in the visions but he ignored them just like he ignored Catelyn and kept climbing towers. Everyone is paying Bran\u2019s disobedience and he is going to pay with his life. When the Third Eyed Raven was asleep, Bran travelled into an indefinite time period and got his mark from the Night King. This might have happened long before Bran was even born or before he got paralysed. Therefore the Night King already was connected to Bran but Bran had to get the mark first to start realising and reinforcing the connection. The connection the Night King has to Bran gives him some glimpses of a human living self which is why he is superior to the wights and the White Walkers and shows rudimentary human logic and sense of purpose and identity. With the same reasoning, it\u2019s only after the mark that Bran loses all emotions and vigor.</p><p>Upon first meeting Jaime, Jaime who is probably Azor Ahai immediately tried to kill Bran. When Catelyn asked him much later why he threw her son out of the window, Jaime did not respond even though soon afterwards he confessed he sleeps with his sister so hiding this was not the reason he did not respond. It was fate that drove Jaime\u2019s hand because even though he doesn\u2019t know it, Jaime is driven by a force to become the leader against the darkness. Bran did not die from an 100% deadly fall because although it was Jaime who did it, it was not the right time yet because he wasn\u2019t yet reborn as Azor Ahai and the Night King did not yet live through Bran. Bran\u2019s first encounter with the fighter of the Lord of Light is the beginning for his journey to meet his destiny and as soon as Jaime cripples him, he starts getting visions that call him to the North. We might say that Jaime sets the evil going in order for good to fight back and prevail. <i>The things I do for love\u2026 </i>Fighting evil?</p><p>And now\u2026some more evidence about the story can be taken from the spotify playlist that hints at the ending of the show according to D&amp;D. Let\u2019s see the songs in the very end of the list:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"571\" data-orig-height=\"179\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41b1ce7d849b5bb265a13b594b6b41a2/tumblr_inline_pqsctpO1C51tgbnyl_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"571\" data-orig-height=\"179\"></figure><p>Gold Lion\u2026 In the\u00a0\u201cKnight of the Seven Kingdoms\u201d Tyrion and Jaime reminince on their past \u201cglorious\u201d days when Jaime was a Golden Lion and Tyrion was a whoremonger. Jaime specifically says his golden lion days belong to the past (which is like the most basic foreshadowing of tragic irony) but the playlist disagrees. Here are some lyrics from the song:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>Gold lion\u2019s gonna tell me where the light is\u2026<br>Tell me what you saw\u2026<br>We\u2019ll build a fire in your eyes\u2026</i></p></blockquote><p>If this is not the most ultimate \u201cJaime is Azor Ahai with Lightbringer\u201d evidence, I don\u2019t know what is.\u00a0</p><p>Then we have Here\u2019s Your Future, which is a song in which God basically is considered responsible for burdening his children with sin. God forces them to sin so that the duty of atoning and cleansing the world falls on them in order to get worthy of\u00a0 the future God has prepared for them. This really sounds like the Lord of Light so I do believe we\u2019re going to have Azor Ahai by the end of the show. It is very similar to the concept of Jaime being destined to be depraved only to be led in the way of atonement, redemption and then glory. Melisandre and all sorts of God faith have been given a huge part to be totally meaningless.\u00a0</p><p>Since I mentioned Melisandre, she was meant to die. Maybe this was the only vision R\u2019hllor truly had for her; that she should die after this fight in the snow. Why? Ser Davos is the last main character Arya saves repeatedly. Ser Davos and Melisandre\u2019s fates have been interwined for long even though they hate each other. Ser Davos witnesses her suicide. Why did Melisandre have to die, in terms of fate? Maybe because, from now on, there aren\u2019t going to be any resurrections. Whoever dies, dies. Why did they change the plot so that Melisandre would need a magical necklace to stay alive?\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"219\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gameofcostumes:jEtcCHbAt_ghRqKAEoUMjw:ZoONga2htO5z0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e31cb1e9a197a671ab7a0cdf3a6fc965/tumblr_pqquyfcEVf1x95fyzo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"219\"></figure><p>Maybe because only one character will have the chance to defy death from now on. Chances are it will be a woman. Why is Ser Davos who literally can\u2019t fight still alive all those years? Maybe because he saw Melisandre drop the necklace and then age and die rapidly. Davos will keep the necklace and probably save a woman he deems worthy of a second chance in life.\u00a0</p><p>And then of course\u00a0\u201cLove is Blindness\u201d. There are only two couples this could apply to; Jaime and Brienne and Tyrion and Sansa but I\u2019m positive Sansa only wants to use Tyrion to weaken Daenerys and fight Cersei. So the only truly fitting love story is that of Jaime and Brienne.<br></p><p>As if all this was not wishful thinking\u2026imagine Brienne sacrificing herself, Jaime becoming a heartbroken Azor Ahai and the ever surviving Davos putting the necklace around her neck, to the one he seemed to be so appreciative and fond of back in the fireplace\u2026</p><p>Okay, okay aren\u2019t all theories partly what we wish it happens? It\u2019s perfectly reasonable if you find this way too much, way too complicated, way too wishful and subjective. If there\u2019s something in here that makes sense to you, you can take this and leave all the rest. I am aware I completely dismissed some basic characters. Let\u2019s say something short about them: Daenerys in my opinion won\u2019t make it to the throne. Not only that but she\u2019s going to be one of the first main characters to die. Even next episode seems probable to me. Arya soon will have her arc completed. I think she reached the peak of her importance. Of all the Starks, I think Sansa is the one who has a chance for the Iron Throne somehow. Right now, she is the most competent in the game of thrones. Littlefinger lives through her. She has admitted to admiring Cersei. One Stark will survive because there must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I honestly have no idea what will happen to Jon Snow. Everyone is sure he\u2019s Azor Ahai but actually there is no evidence the Prince who was Promised and Azor Ahai are the same person. Targaryen heritage is only mentioned in the PWWP prophecy, not that of Azor Ahai. Nevertheless, Jon literally prays to die again. I don\u2019t know if I feel content with the idea of him sitting on the Iron Throne and being depressed all his life because of it.\u00a0</p><p>Cersei of course will die. Tyrion won\u2019t be the one to do it. I would hate it if Arya was the one to do it by wearing one of the brothers\u2019 face. It would be so emotionally anti-climactic and Arya already had her huge killing moment however in the Spotify list there is a song named \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d under the \u201cKiller Wolf\u201d one. God forbid. I hope she uses her skills to someone other than a Lannister because there is also an extremely disturbing and explicit song which is named\u00a0\u201cSister\u201d and guess what, the rather problematic lyrics are about a young boy who slept with his much older sister who is\u2026nuts.</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI was only sixteen but I guess that\u2019s no excuse\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>\n\nOh, sister<br>Don\u2019t put me on the street again<br>Oh, sister<br>I just want to be your friend\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><p>These were the most tolerable lyrics. (Wtf Prince?) I mean, the point of the song in the list is pretty clear. Jaime will meet Cersei once more and let\u2019s hope he\u2019ll kill her for ruining 20+ years of his life. Right now, Jaime doesn\u2019t look particularly interested in Cersei. It seems as if everything regarding her has died inside him. Therefore, something will happen that will fill Jaime with wrath. The scenarios are two:\u00a0</p><ol><li>Bronn kills Tyrion.\u00a0</li><li>Bronn tries to kill Jaime, Brienne defends him and falls.\u00a0</li></ol><p>Both heartbreaking possibilities (although admit it, they are awesome in terms of dramaturgy). Both are terrifying to me but my desperation makes me wish for the first option. The fact that Bronn said in the fifth season that he does not kill women really DOES NOT help. However, if Brienne is Nissa Nissa then Brienne will die after Cersei so Bronn might indeed kill Tyrion. Besides, Nissa Nissa\u2019s sacrifice could also have some figurative meaning instead of foreseeing a literal death.</p><p>All these of course are just personal speculations and wishes. Cersei might be Nissa Nissa. Or Arya might have indeed been Azor Ahai. Jaime and Brienne might just live happily ever after (without Davos\u2019 help) or Jaime might fall heroically. Daenerys might live and rule. Bran maybe is an awesome dude.\u00a0</p><p>I will just say that judging from the way the eighth season is structured, I think D&amp;D played a little game. They featured the huge, foretold battle in the third episode. If the heroes of the whole story were also the heroes of this episode (Arya, Bran, Melisandre) then perhaps it would be wiser if this episode was the fifth or at least the fourth. We are still not exactly in the middle of the season since the total duration of the last three episodes is going to be longer. So if this was the decisive turn of the plot, why would it be featured in the first half of the season? Furthermore, D&amp;D promoted the third episode beyond belief while they kept the next episodes entirely in the dark. That\u2019s got to mean something. Hopefully, D&amp;D planned to create huge expectations for the third episode, therefore not allowing the viewers to build defenses for what would happen next. They tried to satisfy those expectations for the third episode with the exceptional cinematography, direction, music and unprecedented ominous atmosphere they created. This could potentially be the most important deviation from Martin\u2019s future version, in which the Long Night might indeed be the prophecised event that would make Azor Ahai rise and most main characters die. D&amp;D though want the show to be as unpredictable as possible and they have an Iron Throne to give which might mean they used the Long Night as a distraction, however epic.\u00a0</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>A &ldquo;Very Potter Musical&rdquo; theory<br /></h2><p>Okay, no I did not lose my mind. This is not a Very Potter Musical theory but it discusses some similarities between Harry Potter and Game of Thrones and ends with a little help from Spotify. By writing this down I prove I have learned nothing from my past mistake of interpeting the questionable plot twists in BBC Sherlock through an optimistic perspective. I need to get it out though and I&rsquo;ll just hope I won&rsquo;t get too disappointed in the next episodes. Please keep in mind that opinions and preferences amongst GoT fans vary greatly - who is important or evil in my opinion might not be for you.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a long post, so here&rsquo;s a summary of what is discussed:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Review of the Long Night</b></li><li><b>Many parallels between Bran Stark and Harry Potter. Bran is a (dark) grey character in this theory.&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>Arya&rsquo;s importance and whether she is the promised one or not</b></li><li><b>Personal predictions about the next episodes. All main characters are discussed. Might or might not contain wishful thinking. A whole lot about the prophecy of Azor Ahai which I REALLY want to see fulfilled <i>properly</i> before the show ends.&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>Clues from the Spotify Game of Thrones Playlist D&amp;D created for the ending of the show</b></li><li><b>Some noticeable emphasis on Jaime and Brienne. A LOT of Jaime.</b></li></ul><p>First of all, I belong to the few (?) who loved the episode. I doubt any other TV show will ever manage to achieve anything remotely as ambitious. The cinematography is gorgeous, the actors, the crew, the visual effects, the music&hellip; everyone who took part in the making of this episode needs a standing ovation. As for the darkness? It meant to be this way! The darkness was what kept us on edge and it made it harder to understand if a character was dying or not, thus stressing us out even more. The darkness was meant to reinforce the feeling of uncertainty and imminent danger. Whereas Helm&rsquo;s Deep battle was lit to emphasize on the heroism and the stunts, the battle of Winterfell is darkened to emphasize on its unpredictability and the feeling of death lurking in every corner. So it is unfair to rate this episode with 1s or 2s like so many people do. Even if you didn&rsquo;t like the ending, there are so many elements here and so much hard work that deserve acknowledgement.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like everything though. What did I not like? Well, duh, the ending. I was never interested in the whole&nbsp;&ldquo;White Walkers&rdquo; part of the plot and yet Arya killing the Night King in seconds didn&rsquo;t exactly satisfy even the indifferent me. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like Arya and she sure is one of the most lethal characters. It just never occurred to me that she could be connected to this particular subplot. The thing, however, that I interpret very differently than most people writing reviews is that to me there was nothing final about this episode. Many fans act as if this was the general ending of the story and I don&rsquo;t want to be too optimistic but I just don&rsquo;t see it this way. So what then? Are we going to watch Cersei sip wine for the next four and a half hours until Drogon roasts her in the last second? Are they THAT bad? The fact that the characters in the show consider the Dead their greatest threat does not mean that this is the culmination of the plot. Let alone that the fact that the characters think the threat is gone does not mean the threat is gone. Remember the show we&rsquo;re watching - the shocking plot twists always happen when you least expect them. If D&amp;D have now become cowards, we must wait until the end to be able to tell. I, for one, consider the fact that they have not left even a mere second, even a still image, even a comment or a sentence about the last three episodes slip as extremely promising. Even the promo for the next episode is literally two scenes and obviously the least important. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to defend them too much because this has been a boomerang for me in the past <b>*cough sherlock cough*</b>.</p><p>According to what we got, most have assumed that Bran was the ultimate good guy who had orchestrated everything so Arya, Azor Ahai, would kill the Night King.&nbsp; My main argument is that Bran Stark&hellip;just doesn&rsquo;t strike me like an *entirely* good guy. I know people have had enough of Bran is the Villain theories but I am not speaking about a full-blown villain and also&hellip;just consider it for a bit. The Three-Eyed-Raven is supposedly the eternal enemy of the Night King and is a wise entity. There is a problem in Bran&rsquo;s case though: the Night King leaves his mark on him.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b785e2363bbeddba26e461fb913b0c6/tumblr_inline_pqu3a854Vz1tgbnyl_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Don&rsquo;t forget, the Night King is known to create wights simply by touching&nbsp; them. Craster&rsquo;s living babies. Bloody (though dead) Viserion! The intelligence or the living state of the victim doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an obstacle. The Night King then assumes complete control over his creations.</p><p>&nbsp;Do you know what this mark reminds me of?&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8ab9b3f8f15b7d8e951e9675924eeb6/tumblr_inline_pqqwrfaNzN1tgbnyl_400.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This.&nbsp;</p><p>Voldemort tried to kill Harry but his curse turned back at him because Lily had just died to save her child (because of love). It left a scar on Harry&rsquo;s forehead instead of killing him. What happened between Bran and the Night King seems very similar. The Night King wanted to kill or turn into a wight the soon-to-be Third Eyed Raven so he grabbed him by the wrist but Bran wasn&rsquo;t exactly there so there was an obstacle the Night King couldn&rsquo;t fully overcome. Bran escapes him and returns to the present with a mark. We&rsquo;re told that this mark can help the Night King find him. Is this all there is to it though?&nbsp;</p><p>It takes five years for Dumbledore to brace himself and reveal to Harry why his scar is a sensor of Voldemort&rsquo;s presence and extreme mood shifts. The reason is that the day Voldemort tried to kill Harry a part of his already ruined soul was merged with Harry&rsquo;s soul which made them both have access to each other&rsquo;s feelings and thoughts to some degree. As time passed, that connection became stronger, especially as Harry and Voldemort became aware of it. By his fifth year in Hogwarts, Harry&rsquo;s mood is constantly affected by Voldemort&rsquo;s; he&rsquo;s often angry and full of inexplicable hate. He laughs and gets furious and has violent urges all of a sudden without understanding why. He starts getting visions where he <i>is</i> Voldemort.&nbsp; The good thing in Harry&rsquo;s case is that Harry&rsquo;s soul is a pure whole soul that can&rsquo;t get easily corrupted and that some powerful people know about this connection more or less and try to guard him against it (Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius etc).</p><p>If something similar happens to Bran, he is not that lucky. Nobody understands this connection except maybe the previous Third Eyed Raven who is dead. What&rsquo;s worse, Bran does not only fight against the Night King&rsquo;s effect on him. Whereas Harry&rsquo;s soul was pure and healthy and whole, Bran&rsquo;s soul and identity collapses under the weight of partly being both the Night King (or controlled by him) and the Third Eyed Raven. His mind fills with the memory and the wisdom of the world as well as with the awareness of the intent of death. Obviously, little Brandon Stark&rsquo;s emotional and mental world doesn&rsquo;t even make up 1% of the whole consciousness there is now inside him.&nbsp;</p><p>As the Night King gets more powerful day after day, we see an evolution in Bran Stark as well. As the story proceeds, he becomes more and more emotionless and lifeless just like Harry was getting more irritable, envious and violent. Bran starts resembling a dead man. It does not help that the Third Eyed Raven has a pretty neutral stance as well but young Bran suspiciously beats the much older previous Third Eyed Raven in terms of neutrality. When he returns to Winterfell, he has already lost all his feelings for his family. Maybe Bran is still in there but only a last lost hint of him that needs something groundbreaking to happen to cause him to externalize some emotion.&nbsp;</p><p>Another proof that Bran has a more special connection with the Night King than just being tracked down by him is offered to us when a panicked marked Bran (when he still could feel) argues with the Third Eyed Raven that the Night King can&rsquo;t get to him in that sacred place to which the wise entity responds laconically:&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>He can now</i>&rdquo;. Well, if the mark was just a track medium then the Night King would get stuck in the opening of the cave, aware that Bran is inside yet unable to enter. If he can now get in, this possibly means he is already in, protected by being carried by an innocent, still pure and very much alive being; Bran. The Night King is inside and thus the wights can now follow him there.&nbsp;</p><p>Dumbledore thought it was too cruel to reveal to poor Harry that the only way they could completely kill Voldemort was to kill him too.&nbsp; Aaaand Dumbledore thought it was important that Voldemort killed them both himself. The only difference here is that Bran is both the equivalents of Harry and Dumbledore in one body, so Bran himself was the one who knew what had to be done.&nbsp;</p><p>When they are discussing the battle strategy, Bran tells everyone the Night King wants to kill him because he wants to erase the memory of this world.&nbsp;Despite this, Bran requires to be left outside in plain sight so that the Night King will find him and everyone assumes he wants to be the bait, something Bran neither confirms nor denies. But what if he wanted to be the sacrifice instead of the bait? Think about it, Bran&rsquo;s plan makes the Night King supposedly more vulnerable but it also makes the Third Eyed Raven way easier to kill. If Bran waits for him in the open, it&rsquo;s very easy for the Night King to reach him quickly with the dragon and if he does, then all the living die anyway! If Bran was in the crypts, the Night King would have a much longer way to go into the castle, thus having to confront many more living that could hopefully take him down. Honestly, Bran&rsquo;s plan just makes the Night King&rsquo;s job easier.&nbsp; Moreover, Bran does not ask protection. Theon takes the initiative and swears to protect him and Bran once again says nothing because he doesn&rsquo;t want to cause disagreements and end up protected in the crypts or with a more skilled fighter to guard him. At this moment Bran realises Theon is about to die for his cause and he allows it to happen for either the greater good or the greater evil. Bran says he doesn&rsquo;t know if dragon fire can kill the Night King because nobody has tried, therefore making Jon and Daenerys waste all their contribution at trying to take him out in this way. When Daenerys dracarys at him, the Night King shows human traits and smiles sinisterly at her.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3004f32b83e52be6a0b9f9bdbe3d52a/tumblr_inline_pqu4mhYN8y1tgbnyl_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Hehe, tricked ya!</i> Has he ever displayed so particular human reactions before?</p><p>\n\nIn short, I believe Bran wanted to die in this battle. What&rsquo;s questionable is Bran&rsquo;s allegiances. Does Bran want to die to save everyone else or to ensure the Night King&rsquo;s plan is successful? I tend to believe the answer is&hellip;both. The Raven inside him wants the Night King to fail but Night King&rsquo;s consiousness inside him wants him to succeed. Either way Bran must die. However, I think currently the Night King&rsquo;s will inside Bran is winning because Bran would try to pass on somebody else his gift before sacrificing himself. Another question is, is Bran totally honest? What if the Night King&rsquo;s actual plan was to resurrect him or merge with him after killing him which as a result would mean that the Night King would become the Third Eyed Raven, accumulating enormous god-like power?&nbsp;</p><p>Arya prevented Bran&rsquo;s plan whether his intent was good or bad. With this reasoning, Arya is not Azor Ahai because either she delayed the salvation of the living or she didn&rsquo;t completely beat the &ldquo;Final Boss&rdquo;. Of course, there are problems in this theory. Why did Bran want to save himself in the past, why did he not head alone in the north to find the Night King first and end this without so much mayhem? Also, what about Arya and the dagger he gave her?</p><p>Possible answers:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Bran&rsquo;s high consciousness as well as his connection to the Night King get stronger minute after minute. It might have taken him some time to process what he needed or wanted to do and how he would achieve it.&nbsp;</li><li>Well, he is a boy in a wheelchair. Nobody will let him just go find the Night King. He can&rsquo;t escape their notice. Before this, Meera would never agree to take him north obviously.</li><li>The dagger thing is the hardest. Can we still assume there is a limit to what Bran knows and can predict? He doesn&rsquo;t know everything. I think at this point I believe there is truly a God in the ASOIAF world and it seems he has a design for this world indeed. Bran might be more powerful than a regular person but he still is a tool in the divine plan. Besides, upon planning the tactics for the battle, Bran does not seem exactly sure of the outcome. Bran seems to know vaguely who is important but he does not know exactly <i>how</i>. Perhaps Three Eyed Raven Bran sensed Arya was meant to have that dagger but he didn&rsquo;t know yet what for and whether it would benefit his Night King side or not. Furthermore, back then the Night King&rsquo;s effect on him was weaker so that Bran was a better entity than he is now.&nbsp;<br /></li></ol><p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the actual battle. When Melisandre sets the trench on fire, Theon seals his death by telling Bran that the fire is lit and the wights can not proceed (and therefore reach to them). Then - oh so coincidentally - Bran is like&nbsp;&ldquo;OK thanx Theon gotta go now bye&rdquo;. He then wargs into ravens and he leads them straight to the Night King. The ravens reach him and <b>then and only then </b>the Night King commands the wights to fall in the fire and create a bridge for the rest to cross. We see this on screen clearly so I wonder why people don&rsquo;t talk about it at all. I would make a gif but it&rsquo;s too damn dark! (Taking back all good words I said for the darkness lol). In short, Bran gets close to the Night King and sets him into action. Bran betrays them all. Is this a necessary evil for the greater good or just plain evil? Almost everyone was slaughtered after this, so I doubt Bran didn&rsquo;t want to be in the crypts so more people would survive&hellip;bullshit. (Of course, all these apply if we blindly accept that the battle strategy was not just badly written.)</p><p>A similar scene happens in the seventh season when Bran wargs ravens to spy on the Dead and although they all are motionless, standing corpses, when the ravens arrive the Night King abruptly jumps to&hellip;errr&hellip;life and looks at them as if fully aware it&rsquo;s Bran inside them. This terrifies Bran but also probably allows him to learn about the special nature of his connection with him.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49f7f1981360df9ead5aaf6427f4e5c4/tumblr_inline_pqsa4rPQs31tgbnyl_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In Dragonstone, the first episode of the seventh season, the second scene is the dead marching South and the scene cuts to Bran warging while Meera drags him to the Wall.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in the Long Night, Bran stays at warg state throughout the whole battle after this point.&nbsp;Now look&hellip; if you can. Apologies for terrible quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0eee87d4eee5e6e2e626f7a06adf0259/tumblr_inline_pqsazdgXVo1tgbnyl_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Bran never leaves his warg state until the exact moment the Night King arrives and has direct eye contact with him. Therefore, Bran does not need to guide him anymore. He returns to himself and thanks Theon essentially for dying for nothing. However, Theon serves his purpose, delaying Bran&rsquo;s death until Arya arrives. Then he dies betrayed, paying for his betrayal of Robb Stark. Bran then waits passively for the Night King to kill him. Their interaction is basically all but hateful. The Night King just stares at him with something close to content in his face, while Bran looks&hellip;happy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/945010ce1ea151cb6ffd35f1ec0e1b70/tumblr_inline_pquoq4BbeJ1tgbnyl_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is Bran&rsquo;s happy face. I can&rsquo;t unsee it!!!!! It&rsquo;s excited or impatient or something like that&hellip; and Bran makes something like nod with his eyes and then the Night King tries to grab his sword&hellip;.. but Arya arrives out of nowhere and kills him. Look at Bran. He doesn&rsquo;t look at the least bit happy or grateful. His - granted - blank expression somehow shows me he was thinking &ldquo;How the fuck do I undo this now?&rdquo;. Look at Arya smiling at him after they are all saved and Bran&rsquo;s reaction.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5a112c5ad9e2b3cbb924845eb99e113/tumblr_inline_pqsb5fQfv71tgbnyl_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>You&rsquo;re safe now, brother!</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe8561c232945a352d3c05529814c051/tumblr_inline_pqsb7wfA5y1tgbnyl_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Yeah, I am so happy right now I could cut you with the dagger I gave you..&nbsp;</i></p><p>For an extremely expressionless face, I feel like Bran is probably screaming internally here. Tell me, does he look happier with the Night King or Arya?!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s focus on Arya now. As a start, Arya does not fit any of the criteria for Azor Ahai except maybe the first one (Braavos&rsquo; water dance fight style and strong connection of the city with water???). She hasn&rsquo;t killed a Lannister-lion yet and the Nissa Nissa thing makes the probabilities even slimmer. Furthermore, she doesn&rsquo;t kill the Night King with her Needle but with a dagger instead. No fire, no red colour, nothing. Actually, we see her repeatedly asking Gendry to make her the weapon. We&rsquo;ve therefore been told that Arya won&rsquo;t have her sword so she doesn&rsquo;t have a Lightbringer either. Three swords get a lot of mentions in the show: the Needle which Arya did not use at all throughout the battle (she literally uses every possible weapon except the Needle), Heartsbane which Sam gives to Jorah who then falls and Oathkeeper which Jaime gives to Brienne as a token of his love. </p><p>Arya was not Azor Ahai but she still functioned according to the God&rsquo;s plan. The God (whoever he is, the old, the 7, the Lord of Light or the Many-faced one) doesn&rsquo;t want the memory of this world to be lost. What perhaps Bran had not thought (or did not want) is that he should not die until he passed his gift to someone else. If Bran&rsquo;s plan worked, the world as everyone knew it would change forever.  When Bran explains what he is now to everyone, Sam interferes and says they should never let him die. Someone must be the Third Eyed Raven so that the humans will keep being exactly that - humans with history, backgrounds and memories. Here we might be getting the answer about why on earth Sam did not die in the battle. Sam understands better than anyone the importance of this entity. This might hint that he is going to become the Third Eyed Raven once Bran dies or contribute to find the chosen one. The archmaester in the Citadel told Sam something similar:&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>We are the memory of this world.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, things were not going according to plan and also the real Azor Ahai had not showed up yet thus Arya was meant to save the day. Everything Arya did led up to this. She was filled with hate when her father was executed by Joffrey so that she would find the most skilled assassins to train her for revenge. Arya prepares the way for Azor Ahai. Beric was brought up to life to save Arya. The Hound was not killed by Brienne or Arya in order to then save the latter. The Hound most likely has more to do in the story (face Mountain) which is why Beric dies and Sandor does not.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go to the plot armour. Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei and Varys. During the battle, something of utmost importance happens in the crypts. Sansa plants an idea in Tyrion&rsquo;s mind - Daenerys is the obstacle in their way to be a couple. What&rsquo;s next; clever Tyrion will once again be the victim of a woman who promised him love and this is how Daenerys will be betrayed for love, fulfilling the prophecy. Tywin always admitted Tyrion&rsquo;s intelligence but despised him for being so weak in front of his vices; women and alcohol. Tywin cruelly tried to teach him a lesson twice, first with Tysha and then with Shae. But Tyrion did not pay attention and maybe his ultimate downfall is going to be Sansa. Missandei overheard what they said and she is still loyal to Daenerys. Tyrion is in danger. Varys heard them too but he might side with Tyrion. Let&rsquo;s see if mighty Tywin was cruel but spot on. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Greyworm who has promised to protect Missandei. Missandei is in danger now that Sansa knows she can rush to her Queen and tell her what she heard. Perhaps Greyworm survived so that the truth will reach Deanerys. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing did not save Jorah but he held on enough to protect his Queen . Daenerys loses her last truly unyielding supporter. She is now more powerless than ever. Sansa has the upper hand in the North and if Dany opposes to Jon Snow, her fate seems doomed no matter what Missandei and Greyworm do. Then again, if Sansa finds out about Jon&rsquo;s heritage, she might start being less friendly too. A cousin starts getting too distant especially when power is involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Jon, the heir, whose purpose however was not to defeat the White Walkers. His purpose was to tell the world of their existence or he might have a great part to play in the last war.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Tormund, Jaime, Brienne and Podrick. Out of all these only Brienne and Tormund naturally make sense to be still alive because of their strength and skill. And then we have one-handed Jaime and Podrick who honestly should have died in the first ten minutes. While everyone else fights for their life, Brienne and Jaime keep constantly saving each other almost like they are in their own world. Podrick surviving is very weird but we have already been shown that the boy has hidden talents. Podrick has not completed his arc.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Jaime, Bran told him he shouldn&rsquo;t have him killed before he got to help &ldquo;them&rdquo;. And then the battle comes and he merely survives. Arya&rsquo;s timing saves him (and his love) in the last second. Jaime did nothing important for or against the Night King or Bran yet.  Jaime was trapped in the battle, hardly able to survive let alone reach to Bran. Sure, Jaime killed probably hundreds of wights that night but he didn&rsquo;t affect the grand scheme of things in this battle like Bran implied. Yet, Bran literally waited for him a whole night out in the dark cold. This must mean we have a lot more to see in the next episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s timing saves Gendry and Sam but not Edd. Gendry still has a claim to the throne. Edd died so that Sam could live. I already spoke of Sam&rsquo;s importance. But something weird happens when Edd saves Sam. Sam falls down exhausted but something catches his attention. See the gifs in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVzifSke0G_l_gbDg2SEIjg\">@nochancennochoice</a> &lsquo;s <a href=\"https://asherlockstudy.tumblr.com/post/184575306005/joannaoftarth-nochancennochoice-curious#notes\">post</a>: there is some debate on whether Sam sees Brienne, Jaime fighting with his two hands oooor Jaime fighting with a right hand. I think it looks like the third option is the right one and it would explain why confused Sam has a pausing moment in all this mayhem and forgets the world around him until Edd calls him back to reality. Sam sees Jaime through the flames, being in a delirious state, fighting like crazy with what looks like his right hand suspiciously a lot. We can be sure Jaime did not use his non-existent hand though - so could this be a vision in the flames by the Lord of Light&hellip;you know&hellip;a more accurate one than the ones Melisandre sees? Jaime was indeed fighting like crazy but Sam sees a changed image through the fire that puzzles him quite a bit. We&rsquo;ll soon see if there was hidden importance in this oddly specific scene and, once more, it would explain why Samwell Tarly would survive the long night.</p><p>This does not mean Jaime is definitely the legendary warrior. However, he is the most likely contender in my opinion because a) he leaves his false vile identity in the past inside smoke and water (let&rsquo;s pretend the baths had salts), b) he indirectly kills a lion, his father, c) he&rsquo;s truly the only character who is basically exclusively driven by love and we know Azor Ahai must make the ultimate sacrifice.  Perhaps though and dreadfully so, Jaime still hasn&rsquo;t killed a lion because his father&rsquo;s murder is not on him. This might be the fulfilment of the Valonqar prophecy and Jaime gets to kill Cersei. At this point the story will have proceeded a lot and Jaime and Brienne will have confessed their love or acted upon it. Jaime has saved Brienne more times than we can count and especially in the first incidents Brienne asks him why, both in the show and the books. Jaime never responds in the show but in the books we see that he has meaningful dreams that lead his way. Jaime was destined to find Brienne, love her and keep her alive. Jaime gives her his sword and Brienne bonds with it so much that it almost already is part of her entity. The last challenge for Azor Ahai is to sacrifice his willing loving wife Nissa Nissa whose soul will become one with the sword and this will create the Lightbringer. It pains me to even think about it but Nissa Nissa doesn&rsquo;t sound like Cersei. Brienne will die so that Jaime can meet his fate. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5d8f1f0e747c153c783e590fe7358141/tumblr_inline_pqsc3trXuX1tgbnyl_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Three guesses who. </p><p>After that Jaime and Oathkeeper will end this story by killing Bran. Bran still has a good side in him and it&rsquo;s probable that he will guide Jaime to do it. I&rsquo;m gonna cheat here with my evidence but this kinda explains why Nikolaj Coster Waldau loves the conclusion of the story but seems kinda sympathetic when Gwendoline Christie says she had trouble processing the end of her character and needed long walks at the beach and such. When asked, Nikolaj probably revealed too much at some point because he said the story is about that good guy Jaime and that Bran boy who sacrificed himself to save the world. Of course, it&rsquo;s Nik. He might as well be saying what he wants the end to be lol. However&hellip; Bran did not technically sacrifice himself in the Long Night, right? If he knew Arya was coming, then he definitely did not. Either way, the outcome is the same - Bran has not sacrificed himself yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to Bran and the Night King. People in and out of the show wonder why the wights became so powerful and persistent in this era. Furthermore, the Night King seems much more conscious and lifelike than all the other moving corpses. Maybe we can conclude the explanation with the help of Hodor&rsquo;s backstory.  Everyone kept telling Bran to not lose himself in the visions but he ignored them just like he ignored Catelyn and kept climbing towers. Everyone is paying Bran&rsquo;s disobedience and he is going to pay with his life. When the Third Eyed Raven was asleep, Bran travelled into an indefinite time period and got his mark from the Night King. This might have happened long before Bran was even born or before he got paralysed. Therefore the Night King already was connected to Bran but Bran had to get the mark first to start realising and reinforcing the connection. The connection the Night King has to Bran gives him some glimpses of a human living self which is why he is superior to the wights and the White Walkers and shows rudimentary human logic and sense of purpose and identity. With the same reasoning, it&rsquo;s only after the mark that Bran loses all emotions and vigor.</p><p>Upon first meeting Jaime, Jaime who is probably Azor Ahai immediately tried to kill Bran. When Catelyn asked him much later why he threw her son out of the window, Jaime did not respond even though soon afterwards he confessed he sleeps with his sister so hiding this was not the reason he did not respond. It was fate that drove Jaime&rsquo;s hand because even though he doesn&rsquo;t know it, Jaime is driven by a force to become the leader against the darkness. Bran did not die from an 100% deadly fall because although it was Jaime who did it, it was not the right time yet because he wasn&rsquo;t yet reborn as Azor Ahai and the Night King did not yet live through Bran. Bran&rsquo;s first encounter with the fighter of the Lord of Light is the beginning for his journey to meet his destiny and as soon as Jaime cripples him, he starts getting visions that call him to the North. We might say that Jaime sets the evil going in order for good to fight back and prevail. <i>The things I do for love&hellip; </i>Fighting evil?</p><p>And now&hellip;some more evidence about the story can be taken from the spotify playlist that hints at the ending of the show according to D&amp;D. Let&rsquo;s see the songs in the very end of the list:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41b1ce7d849b5bb265a13b594b6b41a2/tumblr_inline_pqsctpO1C51tgbnyl_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gold Lion&hellip; In the&nbsp;&ldquo;Knight of the Seven Kingdoms&rdquo; Tyrion and Jaime reminince on their past &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; days when Jaime was a Golden Lion and Tyrion was a whoremonger. Jaime specifically says his golden lion days belong to the past (which is like the most basic foreshadowing of tragic irony) but the playlist disagrees. Here are some lyrics from the song:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>Gold lion&rsquo;s gonna tell me where the light is&hellip;<br />Tell me what you saw&hellip;<br />We&rsquo;ll build a fire in your eyes&hellip;</i></p></blockquote><p>If this is not the most ultimate &ldquo;Jaime is Azor Ahai with Lightbringer&rdquo; evidence, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we have Here&rsquo;s Your Future, which is a song in which God basically is considered responsible for burdening his children with sin. God forces them to sin so that the duty of atoning and cleansing the world falls on them in order to get worthy of&nbsp; the future God has prepared for them. This really sounds like the Lord of Light so I do believe we&rsquo;re going to have Azor Ahai by the end of the show. It is very similar to the concept of Jaime being destined to be depraved only to be led in the way of atonement, redemption and then glory. Melisandre and all sorts of God faith have been given a huge part to be totally meaningless.&nbsp;</p><p>Since I mentioned Melisandre, she was meant to die. Maybe this was the only vision R&rsquo;hllor truly had for her; that she should die after this fight in the snow. Why? Ser Davos is the last main character Arya saves repeatedly. Ser Davos and Melisandre&rsquo;s fates have been interwined for long even though they hate each other. Ser Davos witnesses her suicide. Why did Melisandre have to die, in terms of fate? Maybe because, from now on, there aren&rsquo;t going to be any resurrections. Whoever dies, dies. Why did they change the plot so that Melisandre would need a magical necklace to stay alive?&nbsp;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Maybe because only one character will have the chance to defy death from now on. Chances are it will be a woman. Why is Ser Davos who literally can&rsquo;t fight still alive all those years? Maybe because he saw Melisandre drop the necklace and then age and die rapidly. Davos will keep the necklace and probably save a woman he deems worthy of a second chance in life.&nbsp;</p><p>And then of course&nbsp;&ldquo;Love is Blindness&rdquo;. There are only two couples this could apply to; Jaime and Brienne and Tyrion and Sansa but I&rsquo;m positive Sansa only wants to use Tyrion to weaken Daenerys and fight Cersei. So the only truly fitting love story is that of Jaime and Brienne.<br /></p><p>As if all this was not wishful thinking&hellip;imagine Brienne sacrificing herself, Jaime becoming a heartbroken Azor Ahai and the ever surviving Davos putting the necklace around her neck, to the one he seemed to be so appreciative and fond of back in the fireplace&hellip;</p><p>Okay, okay aren&rsquo;t all theories partly what we wish it happens? It&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable if you find this way too much, way too complicated, way too wishful and subjective. If there&rsquo;s something in here that makes sense to you, you can take this and leave all the rest. I am aware I completely dismissed some basic characters. Let&rsquo;s say something short about them: Daenerys in my opinion won&rsquo;t make it to the throne. Not only that but she&rsquo;s going to be one of the first main characters to die. Even next episode seems probable to me. Arya soon will have her arc completed. I think she reached the peak of her importance. Of all the Starks, I think Sansa is the one who has a chance for the Iron Throne somehow. Right now, she is the most competent in the game of thrones. Littlefinger lives through her. She has admitted to admiring Cersei. One Stark will survive because there must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I honestly have no idea what will happen to Jon Snow. Everyone is sure he&rsquo;s Azor Ahai but actually there is no evidence the Prince who was Promised and Azor Ahai are the same person. Targaryen heritage is only mentioned in the PWWP prophecy, not that of Azor Ahai. Nevertheless, Jon literally prays to die again. I don&rsquo;t know if I feel content with the idea of him sitting on the Iron Throne and being depressed all his life because of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Cersei of course will die. Tyrion won&rsquo;t be the one to do it. I would hate it if Arya was the one to do it by wearing one of the brothers&rsquo; face. It would be so emotionally anti-climactic and Arya already had her huge killing moment however in the Spotify list there is a song named &ldquo;Dead Skin Mask&rdquo; under the &ldquo;Killer Wolf&rdquo; one. God forbid. I hope she uses her skills to someone other than a Lannister because there is also an extremely disturbing and explicit song which is named&nbsp;&ldquo;Sister&rdquo; and guess what, the rather problematic lyrics are about a young boy who slept with his much older sister who is&hellip;nuts.</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nI was only sixteen but I guess that&rsquo;s no excuse\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>\n\nOh, sister<br />Don&rsquo;t put me on the street again<br />Oh, sister<br />I just want to be your friend\n\n</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>These were the most tolerable lyrics. (Wtf Prince?) I mean, the point of the song in the list is pretty clear. Jaime will meet Cersei once more and let&rsquo;s hope he&rsquo;ll kill her for ruining 20+ years of his life. Right now, Jaime doesn&rsquo;t look particularly interested in Cersei. It seems as if everything regarding her has died inside him. Therefore, something will happen that will fill Jaime with wrath. The scenarios are two:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Bronn kills Tyrion.&nbsp;</li><li>Bronn tries to kill Jaime, Brienne defends him and falls.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Both heartbreaking possibilities (although admit it, they are awesome in terms of dramaturgy). Both are terrifying to me but my desperation makes me wish for the first option. The fact that Bronn said in the fifth season that he does not kill women really DOES NOT help. However, if Brienne is Nissa Nissa then Brienne will die after Cersei so Bronn might indeed kill Tyrion. Besides, Nissa Nissa&rsquo;s sacrifice could also have some figurative meaning instead of foreseeing a literal death.</p><p>All these of course are just personal speculations and wishes. Cersei might be Nissa Nissa. Or Arya might have indeed been Azor Ahai. Jaime and Brienne might just live happily ever after (without Davos&rsquo; help) or Jaime might fall heroically. Daenerys might live and rule. Bran maybe is an awesome dude.&nbsp;</p><p>I will just say that judging from the way the eighth season is structured, I think D&amp;D played a little game. They featured the huge, foretold battle in the third episode. If the heroes of the whole story were also the heroes of this episode (Arya, Bran, Melisandre) then perhaps it would be wiser if this episode was the fifth or at least the fourth. We are still not exactly in the middle of the season since the total duration of the last three episodes is going to be longer. So if this was the decisive turn of the plot, why would it be featured in the first half of the season? Furthermore, D&amp;D promoted the third episode beyond belief while they kept the next episodes entirely in the dark. That&rsquo;s got to mean something. Hopefully, D&amp;D planned to create huge expectations for the third episode, therefore not allowing the viewers to build defenses for what would happen next. They tried to satisfy those expectations for the third episode with the exceptional cinematography, direction, music and unprecedented ominous atmosphere they created. This could potentially be the most important deviation from Martin&rsquo;s future version, in which the Long Night might indeed be the prophecised event that would make Azor Ahai rise and most main characters die. D&amp;D though want the show to be as unpredictable as possible and they have an Iron Throne to give which might mean they used the Long Night as a distraction, however epic.&nbsp;</p></p>",
