Sundays when both her and Harry\u2019s schedules were clear of social commitments or family get-togethers, and they devoted their time to changing linens, making laundry and cuddling the day away while catching up on The Great British Bake Off. Maybe sharing a bath if the mood called for it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The house would always be filled with music, the vintage phonograph proudly installed by the fireplace never dormant for too long. They had acquired quite the vinyl collection over the years, what with them being so passionate about music. They did first meet backstage at a Fleetwood Mac concert after all\u2026</p><p>As she walked into the master bedroom absentmindedly humming the suave notes of Etta James\u2019 <i>I\u2019d rather be blind</i>, y/n was welcomed by a serenade of bird chirps wafting through the window Harry had left opened. The curtains were swirling under a light breeze, letting a few beams of sunlight invite themselves into this loving home.\u00a0</p><p>Spring was back, sending its best ambassadors to greet the souls drained from the sullen days of Winter\u2019s reign. Y/n found herself yearning for a quiet stroll in the park to absorb a bit of this atmospheric positivity. It would have to wait after housework duties, however.\u00a0</p><p>Laundry basket tucked at her side, she started picking up the clothes that were still roaming around the room. Harry and her weren\u2019t a messy couple per se, but the madness of the past week had left the two of them so knackered, by the time they\u2019d step foot in their bedroom they only had energy to undress and collapse on the bed in a dull slumber.</p><p>That\u2019s why y/n reveled in those days off where her to-do list remained blank. They were rejuvenating and gave her a chance to bask in Harry\u2019s company, something she\u2019d never stopped longing for, even in the craziest of worlds. No matter how hectic life could get she always knew what was awaiting her at home: 4 years worth of loving support and blissful happiness.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t go without saying they\u2019d hit a few bumps in the road of course. Times where distance became overwhelming, where their lives never seemed to quite coordinate and they basically had to juggle with work commitments and holidays to see each other on the regular. It transpired in rushed and desperate mid-night Skype calls or petty arguments stirred by frustration and longing. Their love never wavered under the pressure though, they knew they were together for the long-run. The one that was made of enchanting promises; the one that opened the path to a peaceful yet passionate sense of belonging. The one that eventually led to happy-endings.</p><!-- more --><p>Once the room was clear of any lingering clothes, y/n started heading towards the en suite bathroom. That was until her eyes caught sight of a sock that had slithered its way under the bed. Retracing her steps, she knelt down on the carpeted floor to grab it expecting to find its twin sister further in. She frowned when she couldn\u2019t find it and stood back up.\u00a0</p><p>It was a pretty rare occurrence in this household, but y/n absolutely loathed the solitary-sock syndrome. It just irked her in the same way she hated it when one of her earbud wouldn\u2019t quite adjust like the other. Determined to find the missing item, she went though the half-full laundry basket but found herself even more disgruntled when she came up empty-handed. Letting a small sigh, she took another glance at the clothes-free room before her eyes landed on the dresser by the window.\u00a0</p><p>Of course they had a walk-in closet where they stored all of their clothing; because let\u2019s be honest, a single dresser could never fit all of Harry\u2019s suites and shoes. With that being said, they still had a chest of drawers in the bedroom to keep undergarments, nightwear, and other comfort clothes. Y/n begrudgingly made her way over to it and opened Harry\u2019s sock drawers thinking the sock might have fallen down from a previous laundry batch.\u00a0</p><p>She kept rummaging and scouring the entire drawer for a lonely fellow sock, only stopping when her fingers came in contact with something sturdy. Y/n frowned once again as her fingers brushed its velvety surface. Elbow-deep in the drawer she couldn\u2019t see what it was, so she took it out.</p><p>All her irritation dissolved once she looked at the small box resting in the palm of her hand. Her breath hitched, sending her heart hammering for more oxygen. It couldn\u2019t be what she was thinking, right? Truth be told, the idea wasn\u2019t that far-fetched. They had been dating for a few years and had never been in a more stable place than they were now. The situation didn\u2019t feel any less surreal to y/n though. While they were confident they were each others\u2019 \u2018it\u2019, the topic of marriage had never been brought up.\u00a0</p><p>Y/n would be lying if she said she had never thought of it herself; but it had always been one of these \u2018one day\u2019 thoughts. Short scenarios she\u2019d conjured up behind her eyelids during those few minutes of altered consciousness right before joining dreamland. It\u2019d also flashed through her mind when she\u2019d watched her best friend get married, Harry\u2019s arm thrown on the back of her chair, his fingers intertwined with hers. He\u2019d then looked at her with a soft smile and kissed her temple tenderly. She could still feel him smiling against her skin.\u00a0</p><p>Now she didn\u2019t know what to do, her sock hunt completely dismissed. Should she open it? Make sure she wasn\u2019t drawing up crazy (yet delightful) conclusions? Should she ask him about it? Act like she\u2019d never found it and look surprise when he did popped the question?</p><p>She hissed a quiet &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; as the whirlwind of thoughts going through her head started overwhelming her. She was caught in a stage of half giddiness and half confusion; ultimately happy by her finding but lost on how to deal with it. She was so deep in thoughts contemplating what was the right thing to do, that she didn\u2019t hear the footsteps approaching. Nor Harry\u2019s voice echoing from the hallway.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey babe, do you know if we got any Windex left, I can\u2019t find it anywh-&rdquo; his raspy voice faded as he entered the room and took her in. Or more like what was in her hand. Much like she did, he let out a quiet expletive before running his hand through his hair.\u00a0</p><p>She got pulled out of her trance once she caught his nervous habit in the corner of her eye. Turning to face him with her mouth slightly open as if she wanted to say something but wasn\u2019t quite sure what, she just stared at him. Just like her, he was wearing casual clothes, a rag thrown over his shoulder. He looked fidgety, nervous, and so unHarry-like when he spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I\u2026&rdquo; It turned out he didn\u2019t know what to say either though. Instead he slowly walked towards her, gulping as he came right in front of her. His hands went automatically underneath her forearms like his brain didn\u2019t need to command his body to carry out the action. The silence was deafening as they indulged in a spellbinding gaze. And then she spasmed out of it, words tumbling out of her lips one after the other as she frantically reached for his hand to give him the box back.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit Harry I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to go through your stuff. I just couldn\u2019t find a stupid sock so I thought, you know, maybe I\u2019d find it in there. But they I felt something solid between your socks and I didn\u2019t know what it was until I pulled it out. And I didn\u2019t look inside I promise, I just\u2026I\u2019m sorry.&rdquo; She exhaled rather harshly to punctuate the end of her rant, wide eyes begging for him to say something. Harry softy chuckled, somewhat endeared by her reaction. They were still standing very close to each other, foreheads almost touching.</p><p>&ldquo;It\u2019s okay, love\u2026 Guess I got busted.&rdquo; He was full-on smiling in that way that made her belly tingle. Eyes so fucking bright and lips stretched slightly more on one side like he was trying to tone it down a little as to not look like a beaming fool.\u00a0</p><p>Y/n was still in a semi daze, unsure of where the situation was going and looking at him with those doe eyes he liked to lose himself in every night. Harry then cradled her waist with the hand still holding the box and cupped her jaw with the other. Then after licking his lips unfazed he started talking.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Don\u2019t know what I was waiting for really\u2026S\u2019not like I have any doubts.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Harry-&rdquo; Y/n almost interrupted in a quavering voice. Suddenly she got the feeling she knew where this was heading and it made her nerves go out of whack. Her eyes dampened slightly and before she could add anything Harry\u2019s voice filled the room again.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(it\u2019s really worth listening I swear\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zdHh_D_b5xU\">https://youtu.be/zdHh_D_b5xU</a>)</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I\u2019ve had it for weeks. Just thinkin\u2019 about how to ask ya, tryin\u2019 to come up with something good, something perfect, \u2019cause you\u2019re worth everything and than some.&rdquo; He was getting quite emotional himself, voice weakening on the last word and Y/n couldn\u2019t help but chuckle breathlessly as she wrapped her hand around Harry\u2019s neck pulling him that much closer to her.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;But it\u2019s never been like that between us, has it? Never been about where I take you to dinner or how exceptional we made the special days, hum?&rdquo; His thumb was caressing her jaw, encouraging her to answer.</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;they are special because it\u2019s you.&rdquo; Harry\u2019s smile stretched once more, and he carefully leaned his forehead against hers. Closing his eyes for a moment, he let the hand he kept around her waist slid up to rest on the side of her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I fell under your spell on the day I met you at that Fleetwood Mac gig. The way you were swaying to <i>Crystal</i> with those sparkling eyes of yours, I was&hellip;entranced.&rdquo; Harry started swaying from side to side as he indulged in the memory.</p><p>&ldquo;I love that song&rdquo; Y/n muttered as she was transported back to that day too.</p><p>&ldquo;Know you do, love. You looked so beautifully happy. Then it was like the song was written for me, for that moment\u2026&rdquo; he kissed her forehead before he started humming quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Do you always trust your first initial feeling</i></p><p><i>Special knowledge, holds true bears believing</i></p><p><i>I turned around and the water was closing all around</i></p><p><i>Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me</i>&rdquo;</p><p>She\u2019d joined him on the last line, tightening her hold around him. She suddenly got an intense feeling of serenity. Surely she should have been going nuts, right? Harry was <i>proposing</i> but all she could think about was how right it felt. How there was no place else she\u2019d rather be and how she wouldn\u2019t change this moment one bit if she was given the chance.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s like Harry said; they didn\u2019t need a nice dinner or a special gesture to make their moments unforgettable. It was all in the rawness of their words, the tenderness of their touch and the love in their eyes.\u00a0</p><p>She sniffed as he cleared the fervor off his throat and they both laughed at how much of a mess they already were. Then he withdrew his hands from her cheek and slowly knelt down before clasping her hands with a knowing smile.</p><p>&ldquo;4 years ago I got that <i>first initial feeling</i> that you\u2019d be an important part of my life. I just didn\u2019t know how much. But after I got to know you, your kindness, your strength, your smile\u2026your little quirks&rdquo; they both laughed, eyes crinkling so hard they forced tears out of their confinement. &ldquo;I knew with my whole heart I could never let you go. And I think you did too because ever since then we\u2019ve stayed <i>true</i> to each other and never stopped <i>believing</i> in us. Through the hard times, the painful ones and the bitter ones, you\u2019ve stayed and supported me a little bit more everyday. You make me feel brave and self-accomplished. Like I can appreciate everything life has given me because I have the one person I\u2019m supposed to share it all with by my side. <i>You\u2019ve found me, love</i>. You\u2019ve found me and if I have any say in the matter, I\u2019ll never let you go. So Y/N Y/L/N, would you please give me the honor of being your husband?&quot;\u00a0</p><p>The small box was opened then, and Y/N couldn\u2019t tell which was shining the most: the beautiful ring or Harry\u2019s emerald eyes. She didn\u2019t hesitate before pulling on the hand that was still in hers so that he\u2019d stand back up and bringing her lips to his own. Kissing turned out to be quite the challenge, they were smiling too much to do anything really; but they still couldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Then Harry suddenly leaned back, incredulity widening his eyes. &quot;Fuck!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked urgently.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn\u2019t say I love you&rdquo; he said in disbelief. &ldquo;Can\u2019t believe I just proposed to you without saying it.&rdquo;</p><p>Her head fell on his chest as she started laughing. &ldquo;Such a dork.&rdquo; She then leveled her head back to his, though really she had to look up because of the height difference. She was met with a pout that she tried to sooth by cupping his cheeks lovingly. He was having none of it though.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey\u2026You didn\u2019t even answer me. A \u2018yes I\u2019ll marry you and I love you Harry\u2019 would have sufficed just enough.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>He wanted to hear her say the words so badly, Y/N couldn\u2019t resist him. She never could. &quot;Harry, I love you so much there are not enough albums in the whole world to describe it, and really, <i>I</i> would be the one honored to be your wife.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>They kissed properly this time. Lips fervently molding against each other like they were trying to translate all the words said for the past minutes into soft gasps, noses brushing and tongues sweeping. They were also getting handsy, Y/N\u2019s hand flying in Harry\u2019s hair while his were\u2026actually busy holding the fucking ring. So once again Harry drew back first with a frustrated frowned plastered on his flushed face.</p><p>&quot;Fuck, come \u2019ere an\u2019 let me put this thing on your finger so I can kiss you proper&rdquo; he said urgently. They both leaned away just enough so that he could slide the diamond at its rightful place before Harry was throwing the empty box somewhere on the bed. When he cradled her cheeks again she was examining the new addition to her hand with a dreamy smile. Then she was looking up and kissing him again.</p><p>They kept making out until they were out of breath, basking in the afterglow. They weren\u2019t boyfriend and girlfriend anymore; they were fianc\u00e9s. It seemed flower blossoms and warmer days were not the only changes this spring was bringing.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Harry?&rdquo; y/n softly asked bumping her nose against Harry\u2019s.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you go on a walk with me?&rdquo; she whispered.\u00a0</p><p>After <i>that</i>, the laundry could wait.</p>",

The one that was made of enchanting promises; the one that opened the path to a peaceful yet passionate sense of belonging. The one that eventually led to happy-endings.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Once the room was clear of any lingering clothes, y/n started heading towards the en suite bathroom. That was until her eyes caught sight of a sock that had slithered its way under the bed. Retracing her steps, she knelt down on the carpeted floor to grab it expecting to find its twin sister further in. She frowned when she couldn\u2019t find it and stood back up.\u00a0</p><p>It was a pretty rare occurrence in this household, but y/n absolutely loathed the solitary-sock syndrome. It just irked her in the same way she hated it when one of her earbud wouldn\u2019t quite adjust like the other. Determined to find the missing item, she went though the half-full laundry basket but found herself even more disgruntled when she came up empty-handed. Letting a small sigh, she took another glance at the clothes-free room before her eyes landed on the dresser by the window.\u00a0</p><p>Of course they had a walk-in closet where they stored all of their clothing; because let\u2019s be honest, a single dresser could never fit all of Harry\u2019s suites and shoes. With that being said, they still had a chest of drawers in the bedroom to keep undergarments, nightwear, and other comfort clothes. Y/n begrudgingly made her way over to it and opened Harry\u2019s sock drawers thinking the sock might have fallen down from a previous laundry batch.\u00a0</p><p>She kept rummaging and scouring the entire drawer for a lonely fellow sock, only stopping when her fingers came in contact with something sturdy. Y/n frowned once again as her fingers brushed its velvety surface. Elbow-deep in the drawer she couldn\u2019t see what it was, so she took it out.</p><p>All her irritation dissolved once she looked at the small box resting in the palm of her hand. Her breath hitched, sending her heart hammering for more oxygen. It couldn\u2019t be what she was thinking, right? Truth be told, the idea wasn\u2019t that far-fetched. They had been dating for a few years and had never been in a more stable place than they were now. The situation didn\u2019t feel any less surreal to y/n though. While they were confident they were each others\u2019 \u2018it\u2019, the topic of marriage had never been brought up.\u00a0</p><p>Y/n would be lying if she said she had never thought of it herself; but it had always been one of these \u2018one day\u2019 thoughts. Short scenarios she\u2019d conjured up behind her eyelids during those few minutes of altered consciousness right before joining dreamland. It\u2019d also flashed through her mind when she\u2019d watched her best friend get married, Harry\u2019s arm thrown on the back of her chair, his fingers intertwined with hers. He\u2019d then looked at her with a soft smile and kissed her temple tenderly. She could still feel him smiling against her skin.\u00a0</p><p>Now she didn\u2019t know what to do, her sock hunt completely dismissed. Should she open it? Make sure she wasn\u2019t drawing up crazy (yet delightful) conclusions? Should she ask him about it? Act like she\u2019d never found it and look surprise when he did popped the question?</p><p>She hissed a quiet \u201cfuck\u201d as the whirlwind of thoughts going through her head started overwhelming her. She was caught in a stage of half giddiness and half confusion; ultimately happy by her finding but lost on how to deal with it. She was so deep in thoughts contemplating what was the right thing to do, that she didn\u2019t hear the footsteps approaching. Nor Harry\u2019s voice echoing from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey babe, do you know if we got any Windex left, I can\u2019t find it anywh-\u201d his raspy voice faded as he entered the room and took her in. Or more like what was in her hand. Much like she did, he let out a quiet expletive before running his hand through his hair.\u00a0</p><p>She got pulled out of her trance once she caught his nervous habit in the corner of her eye. Turning to face him with her mouth slightly open as if she wanted to say something but wasn\u2019t quite sure what, she just stared at him. Just like her, he was wearing casual clothes, a rag thrown over his shoulder. He looked fidgety, nervous, and so unHarry-like when he spoke up.</p><p>\u201cY/n, I\u2026\u201d It turned out he didn\u2019t know what to say either though. Instead he slowly walked towards her, gulping as he came right in front of her. His hands went automatically underneath her forearms like his brain didn\u2019t need to command his body to carry out the action. The silence was deafening as they indulged in a spellbinding gaze. And then she spasmed out of it, words tumbling out of her lips one after the other as she frantically reached for his hand to give him the box back.</p><p>\u201cShit Harry I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to go through your stuff.

Sundays when both her and Harry\u2019s schedules were clear of social commitments or family get-togethers, and they devoted their time to changing linens, making laundry and cuddling the day away while catching up on The Great British Bake Off. Maybe sharing a bath if the mood called for it.\u00a0<br></p><p>The house would always be filled with music, the vintage phonograph proudly installed by the fireplace never dormant for too long. They had acquired quite the vinyl collection over the years, what with them being so passionate about music. They did first meet backstage at a Fleetwood Mac concert after all\u2026</p><p>As she walked into the master bedroom absentmindedly humming the suave notes of Etta James\u2019 <i>I\u2019d rather be blind</i>, y/n was welcomed by a serenade of bird chirps wafting through the window Harry had left opened. The curtains were swirling under a light breeze, letting a few beams of sunlight invite themselves into this loving home.\u00a0</p><p>Spring was back, sending its best ambassadors to greet the souls drained from the sullen days of Winter\u2019s reign. Y/n found herself yearning for a quiet stroll in the park to absorb a bit of this atmospheric positivity. It would have to wait after housework duties, however.\u00a0</p><p>Laundry basket tucked at her side, she started picking up the clothes that were still roaming around the room. Harry and her weren\u2019t a messy couple per se, but the madness of the past week had left the two of them so knackered, by the time they\u2019d step foot in their bedroom they only had energy to undress and collapse on the bed in a dull slumber.</p><p>That\u2019s why y/n reveled in those days off where her to-do list remained blank. They were rejuvenating and gave her a chance to bask in Harry\u2019s company, something she\u2019d never stopped longing for, even in the craziest of worlds. No matter how hectic life could get she always knew what was awaiting her at home: 4 years worth of loving support and blissful happiness.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t go without saying they\u2019d hit a few bumps in the road of course. Times where distance became overwhelming, where their lives never seemed to quite coordinate and they basically had to juggle with work commitments and holidays to see each other on the regular. It transpired in rushed and desperate mid-night Skype calls or petty arguments stirred by frustration and longing. Their love never wavered under the pressure though, they knew they were together for the long-run. The one that was made of enchanting promises; the one that opened the path to a peaceful yet passionate sense of belonging. The one that eventually led to happy-endings.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Once the room was clear of any lingering clothes, y/n started heading towards the en suite bathroom. That was until her eyes caught sight of a sock that had slithered its way under the bed. Retracing her steps, she knelt down on the carpeted floor to grab it expecting to find its twin sister further in. She frowned when she couldn\u2019t find it and stood back up.\u00a0</p><p>It was a pretty rare occurrence in this household, but y/n absolutely loathed the solitary-sock syndrome. It just irked her in the same way she hated it when one of her earbud wouldn\u2019t quite adjust like the other. Determined to find the missing item, she went though the half-full laundry basket but found herself even more disgruntled when she came up empty-handed. Letting a small sigh, she took another glance at the clothes-free room before her eyes landed on the dresser by the window.\u00a0</p><p>Of course they had a walk-in closet where they stored all of their clothing; because let\u2019s be honest, a single dresser could never fit all of Harry\u2019s suites and shoes. With that being said, they still had a chest of drawers in the bedroom to keep undergarments, nightwear, and other comfort clothes. Y/n begrudgingly made her way over to it and opened Harry\u2019s sock drawers thinking the sock might have fallen down from a previous laundry batch.\u00a0</p><p>She kept rummaging and scouring the entire drawer for a lonely fellow sock, only stopping when her fingers came in contact with something sturdy. Y/n frowned once again as her fingers brushed its velvety surface. Elbow-deep in the drawer she couldn\u2019t see what it was, so she took it out.</p><p>All her irritation dissolved once she looked at the small box resting in the palm of her hand. Her breath hitched, sending her heart hammering for more oxygen. It couldn\u2019t be what she was thinking, right? Truth be told, the idea wasn\u2019t that far-fetched. They had been dating for a few years and had never been in a more stable place than they were now. The situation didn\u2019t feel any less surreal to y/n though. While they were confident they were each others\u2019 \u2018it\u2019, the topic of marriage had never been brought up.\u00a0</p><p>Y/n would be lying if she said she had never thought of it herself; but it had always been one of these \u2018one day\u2019 thoughts. Short scenarios she\u2019d conjured up behind her eyelids during those few minutes of altered consciousness right before joining dreamland. It\u2019d also flashed through her mind when she\u2019d watched her best friend get married, Harry\u2019s arm thrown on the back of her chair, his fingers intertwined with hers. He\u2019d then looked at her with a soft smile and kissed her temple tenderly. She could still feel him smiling against her skin.\u00a0</p><p>Now she didn\u2019t know what to do, her sock hunt completely dismissed. Should she open it? Make sure she wasn\u2019t drawing up crazy (yet delightful) conclusions? Should she ask him about it? Act like she\u2019d never found it and look surprise when he did popped the question?</p><p>She hissed a quiet \u201cfuck\u201d as the whirlwind of thoughts going through her head started overwhelming her. She was caught in a stage of half giddiness and half confusion; ultimately happy by her finding but lost on how to deal with it. She was so deep in thoughts contemplating what was the right thing to do, that she didn\u2019t hear the footsteps approaching. Nor Harry\u2019s voice echoing from the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey babe, do you know if we got any Windex left, I can\u2019t find it anywh-\u201d his raspy voice faded as he entered the room and took her in. Or more like what was in her hand. Much like she did, he let out a quiet expletive before running his hand through his hair.\u00a0</p><p>She got pulled out of her trance once she caught his nervous habit in the corner of her eye. Turning to face him with her mouth slightly open as if she wanted to say something but wasn\u2019t quite sure what, she just stared at him. Just like her, he was wearing casual clothes, a rag thrown over his shoulder. He looked fidgety, nervous, and so unHarry-like when he spoke up.</p><p>\u201cY/n, I\u2026\u201d It turned out he didn\u2019t know what to say either though. Instead he slowly walked towards her, gulping as he came right in front of her. His hands went automatically underneath her forearms like his brain didn\u2019t need to command his body to carry out the action. The silence was deafening as they indulged in a spellbinding gaze. And then she spasmed out of it, words tumbling out of her lips one after the other as she frantically reached for his hand to give him the box back.</p><p>\u201cShit Harry I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to go through your stuff. I just couldn\u2019t find a stupid sock so I thought, you know, maybe I\u2019d find it in there. But they I felt something solid between your socks and I didn\u2019t know what it was until I pulled it out. And I didn\u2019t look inside I promise, I just\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She exhaled rather harshly to punctuate the end of her rant, wide eyes begging for him to say something. Harry softy chuckled, somewhat endeared by her reaction. They were still standing very close to each other, foreheads almost touching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, love\u2026 Guess I got busted.\u201d He was full-on smiling in that way that made her belly tingle. Eyes so fucking bright and lips stretched slightly more on one side like he was trying to tone it down a little as to not look like a beaming fool.\u00a0</p><p>Y/n was still in a semi daze, unsure of where the situation was going and looking at him with those doe eyes he liked to lose himself in every night. Harry then cradled her waist with the hand still holding the box and cupped her jaw with the other. Then after licking his lips unfazed he started talking.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what I was waiting for really\u2026S\u2019not like I have any doubts.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Harry-\u201d Y/n almost interrupted in a quavering voice. Suddenly she got the feeling she knew where this was heading and it made her nerves go out of whack. Her eyes dampened slightly and before she could add anything Harry\u2019s voice filled the room again.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(it\u2019s really worth listening I swear\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zdHh_D_b5xU\">https://youtu.be/zdHh_D_b5xU</a>)</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it for weeks. Just thinkin\u2019 about how to ask ya, tryin\u2019 to come up with something good, something perfect, \u2019cause you\u2019re worth everything and than some.\u201d He was getting quite emotional himself, voice weakening on the last word and Y/n couldn\u2019t help but chuckle breathlessly as she wrapped her hand around Harry\u2019s neck pulling him that much closer to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s never been like that between us, has it? Never been about where I take you to dinner or how exceptional we made the special days, hum?\u201d His thumb was caressing her jaw, encouraging her to answer.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she whispered, \u201cthey are special because it\u2019s you.\u201d Harry\u2019s smile stretched once more, and he carefully leaned his forehead against hers. Closing his eyes for a moment, he let the hand he kept around her waist slid up to rest on the side of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know I fell under your spell on the day I met you at that Fleetwood Mac gig. The way you were swaying to <i>Crystal</i> with those sparkling eyes of yours, I was\u2026entranced.\u201d Harry started swaying from side to side as he indulged in the memory.</p><p>\u201cI love that song\u201d Y/n muttered as she was transported back to that day too.</p><p>\u201cKnow you do, love. You looked so beautifully happy. Then it was like the song was written for me, for that moment\u2026\u201d he kissed her forehead before he started humming quietly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Do you always trust your first initial feeling</i></p><p><i>Special knowledge, holds true bears believing</i></p><p><i>I turned around and the water was closing all around</i></p><p><i>Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me</i>\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d joined him on the last line, tightening her hold around him. She suddenly got an intense feeling of serenity. Surely she should have been going nuts, right? Harry was <i>proposing</i> but all she could think about was how right it felt. How there was no place else she\u2019d rather be and how she wouldn\u2019t change this moment one bit if she was given the chance.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s like Harry said; they didn\u2019t need a nice dinner or a special gesture to make their moments unforgettable. It was all in the rawness of their words, the tenderness of their touch and the love in their eyes.\u00a0</p><p>She sniffed as he cleared the fervor off his throat and they both laughed at how much of a mess they already were. Then he withdrew his hands from her cheek and slowly knelt down before clasping her hands with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201c4 years ago I got that <i>first initial feeling</i> that you\u2019d be an important part of my life. I just didn\u2019t know how much. But after I got to know you, your kindness, your strength, your smile\u2026your little quirks\u201d they both laughed, eyes crinkling so hard they forced tears out of their confinement. \u201cI knew with my whole heart I could never let you go. And I think you did too because ever since then we\u2019ve stayed <i>true</i> to each other and never stopped <i>believing</i> in us. Through the hard times, the painful ones and the bitter ones, you\u2019ve stayed and supported me a little bit more everyday. You make me feel brave and self-accomplished. Like I can appreciate everything life has given me because I have the one person I\u2019m supposed to share it all with by my side. <i>You\u2019ve found me, love</i>. You\u2019ve found me and if I have any say in the matter, I\u2019ll never let you go. So Y/N Y/L/N, would you please give me the honor of being your husband?\"\u00a0</p><p>The small box was opened then, and Y/N couldn\u2019t tell which was shining the most: the beautiful ring or Harry\u2019s emerald eyes. She didn\u2019t hesitate before pulling on the hand that was still in hers so that he\u2019d stand back up and bringing her lips to his own. Kissing turned out to be quite the challenge, they were smiling too much to do anything really; but they still couldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Then Harry suddenly leaned back, incredulity widening his eyes. \"Fuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I love you\u201d he said in disbelief. \u201cCan\u2019t believe I just proposed to you without saying it.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell on his chest as she started laughing. \u201cSuch a dork.\u201d She then leveled her head back to his, though really she had to look up because of the height difference. She was met with a pout that she tried to sooth by cupping his cheeks lovingly. He was having none of it though.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026You didn\u2019t even answer me. A \u2018yes I\u2019ll marry you and I love you Harry\u2019 would have sufficed just enough.\"\u00a0</p><p>He wanted to hear her say the words so badly, Y/N couldn\u2019t resist him. She never could. \"Harry, I love you so much there are not enough albums in the whole world to describe it, and really, <i>I</i> would be the one honored to be your wife.\"\u00a0</p><p>They kissed properly this time. Lips fervently molding against each other like they were trying to translate all the words said for the past minutes into soft gasps, noses brushing and tongues sweeping. They were also getting handsy, Y/N\u2019s hand flying in Harry\u2019s hair while his were\u2026actually busy holding the fucking ring. So once again Harry drew back first with a frustrated frowned plastered on his flushed face.</p><p>\"Fuck, come \u2019ere an\u2019 let me put this thing on your finger so I can kiss you proper\u201d he said urgently. They both leaned away just enough so that he could slide the diamond at its rightful place before Harry was throwing the empty box somewhere on the bed. When he cradled her cheeks again she was examining the new addition to her hand with a dreamy smile. Then she was looking up and kissing him again.</p><p>They kept making out until they were out of breath, basking in the afterglow. They weren\u2019t boyfriend and girlfriend anymore; they were fianc\u00e9s. It seemed flower blossoms and warmer days were not the only changes this spring was bringing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Harry?\u201d y/n softly asked bumping her nose against Harry\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go on a walk with me?\u201d she whispered.\u00a0</p><p>After <i>that</i>, the laundry could wait.</p></p>",

Then after licking his lips unfazed he started talking.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what I was waiting for really&hellip;S&rsquo;not like I have any doubts.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Harry-&rdquo; Y/n almost interrupted in a quavering voice. Suddenly she got the feeling she knew where this was heading and it made her nerves go out of whack. Her eyes dampened slightly and before she could add anything Harry&rsquo;s voice filled the room again.</p><blockquote><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(it&rsquo;s really worth listening I swear&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zdHh_D_b5xU\">https://youtu.be/zdHh_D_b5xU</a>)</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it for weeks. Just thinkin&rsquo; about how to ask ya, tryin&rsquo; to come up with something good, something perfect, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re worth everything and than some.&rdquo; He was getting quite emotional himself, voice weakening on the last word and Y/n couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle breathlessly as she wrapped her hand around Harry&rsquo;s neck pulling him that much closer to her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s never been like that between us, has it? Never been about where I take you to dinner or how exceptional we made the special days, hum?&rdquo; His thumb was caressing her jaw, encouraging her to answer.</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;they are special because it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s smile stretched once more, and he carefully leaned his forehead against hers. Closing his eyes for a moment, he let the hand he kept around her waist slid up to rest on the side of her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I fell under your spell on the day I met you at that Fleetwood Mac gig. The way you were swaying to <i>Crystal</i> with those sparkling eyes of yours, I was&hellip;entranced.&rdquo; Harry started swaying from side to side as he indulged in the memory.</p><p>&ldquo;I love that song&rdquo; Y/n muttered as she was transported back to that day too.</p><p>&ldquo;Know you do, love. You looked so beautifully happy. Then it was like the song was written for me, for that moment&hellip;&rdquo; he kissed her forehead before he started humming quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Do you always trust your first initial feeling</i></p><p><i>Special knowledge, holds true bears believing</i></p><p><i>I turned around and the water was closing all around</i></p><p><i>Like a glove, like the love that had finally, finally found me</i>&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;d joined him on the last line, tightening her hold around him. She suddenly got an intense feeling of serenity. Surely she should have been going nuts, right? Harry was <i>proposing</i> but all she could think about was how right it felt. How there was no place else she&rsquo;d rather be and how she wouldn&rsquo;t change this moment one bit if she was given the chance.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s like Harry said; they didn&rsquo;t need a nice dinner or a special gesture to make their moments unforgettable. It was all in the rawness of their words, the tenderness of their touch and the love in their eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>She sniffed as he cleared the fervor off his throat and they both laughed at how much of a mess they already were. Then he withdrew his hands from her cheek and slowly knelt down before clasping her hands with a knowing smile.</p><p>&ldquo;4 years ago I got that <i>first initial feeling</i> that you&rsquo;d be an important part of my life. I just didn&rsquo;t know how much. But after I got to know you, your kindness, your strength, your smile&hellip;your little quirks&rdquo; they both laughed, eyes crinkling so hard they forced tears out of their confinement. &ldquo;I knew with my whole heart I could never let you go. And I think you did too because ever since then we&rsquo;ve stayed <i>true</i> to each other and never stopped <i>believing</i> in us. Through the hard times, the painful ones and the bitter ones, you&rsquo;ve stayed and supported me a little bit more everyday. You make me feel brave and self-accomplished. Like I can appreciate everything life has given me because I have the one person I&rsquo;m supposed to share it all with by my side. <i>You&rsquo;ve found me, love</i>. You&rsquo;ve found me and if I have any say in the matter, I&rsquo;ll never let you go. So Y/N Y/L/N, would you please give me the honor of being your husband?\"&nbsp;</p><p>The small box was opened then, and Y/N couldn&rsquo;t tell which was shining the most: the beautiful ring or Harry&rsquo;s emerald eyes. She didn&rsquo;t hesitate before pulling on the hand that was still in hers so that he&rsquo;d stand back up and bringing her lips to his own. Kissing turned out to be quite the challenge, they were smiling too much to do anything really; but they still couldn&rsquo;t let go.</p><p>Then Harry suddenly leaned back, incredulity widening his eyes. \"Fuck!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked urgently.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I love you&rdquo; he said in disbelief. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe I just proposed to you without saying it.&rdquo;</p><p>Her head fell on his chest as she started laughing. &ldquo;Such a dork.&rdquo; She then leveled her head back to his, though really she had to look up because of the height difference. She was met with a pout that she tried to sooth by cupping his cheeks lovingly. He was having none of it though.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;You didn&rsquo;t even answer me. A &lsquo;yes I&rsquo;ll marry you and I love you Harry&rsquo; would have sufficed just enough.\"&nbsp;</p><p>He wanted to hear her say the words so badly, Y/N couldn&rsquo;t resist him. She never could. \"Harry, I love you so much there are not enough albums in the whole world to describe it, and really, <i>I</i> would be the one honored to be your wife.\"&nbsp;</p><p>They kissed properly this time. Lips fervently molding against each other like they were trying to translate all the words said for the past minutes into soft gasps, noses brushing and tongues sweeping. They were also getting handsy, Y/N&rsquo;s hand flying in Harry&rsquo;s hair while his were&hellip;actually busy holding the fucking ring. So once again Harry drew back first with a frustrated frowned plastered on his flushed face.</p><p>\"Fuck, come &rsquo;ere an&rsquo; let me put this thing on your finger so I can kiss you proper&rdquo; he said urgently. They both leaned away just enough so that he could slide the diamond at its rightful place before Harry was throwing the empty box somewhere on the bed. When he cradled her cheeks again she was examining the new addition to her hand with a dreamy smile. Then she was looking up and kissing him again.</p><p>They kept making out until they were out of breath, basking in the afterglow. They weren&rsquo;t boyfriend and girlfriend anymore; they were fianc&eacute;s. It seemed flower blossoms and warmer days were not the only changes this spring was bringing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Harry?&rdquo; y/n softly asked bumping her nose against Harry&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you go on a walk with me?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>After <i>that</i>, the laundry could wait.</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a65d6717762aaa63456535a0b2dcc42b/tumblr_inline_ppdsgvY9qf1wbtdut_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure>\n<p>Lazy Sunday mornings were y/n&rsquo;s favorite. Sundays when both her and Harry&rsquo;s schedules were clear of social commitments or family get-togethers, and they devoted their time to changing linens, making laundry and cuddling the day away while catching up on The Great British Bake Off. Maybe sharing a bath if the mood called for it.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>The house would always be filled with music, the vintage phonograph proudly installed by the fireplace never dormant for too long. They had acquired quite the vinyl collection over the years, what with them being so passionate about music. They did first meet backstage at a Fleetwood Mac concert after all&hellip;</p>\n<p>As she walked into the master bedroom absentmindedly humming the suave notes of Etta James&rsquo; <i>I&rsquo;d rather be blind</i>, y/n was welcomed by a serenade of bird chirps wafting through the window Harry had left opened. The curtains were swirling under a light breeze, letting a few beams of sunlight invite themselves into this loving home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spring was back, sending its best ambassadors to greet the souls drained from the sullen days of Winter&rsquo;s reign. Y/n found herself yearning for a quiet stroll in the park to absorb a bit of this atmospheric positivity. It would have to wait after housework duties, however.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Laundry basket tucked at her side, she started picking up the clothes that were still roaming around the room. Harry and her weren&rsquo;t a messy couple per se, but the madness of the past week had left the two of them so knackered, by the time they&rsquo;d step foot in their bedroom they only had energy to undress and collapse on the bed in a dull slumber.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why y/n reveled in those days off where her to-do list remained blank. They were rejuvenating and gave her a chance to bask in Harry&rsquo;s company, something she&rsquo;d never stopped longing for, even in the craziest of worlds. No matter how hectic life could get she always knew what was awaiting her at home: 4 years worth of loving support and blissful happiness.</p>\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t go without saying they&rsquo;d hit a few bumps in the road of course. Times where distance became overwhelming, where their lives never seemed to quite coordinate and they basically had to juggle with work commitments and holidays to see each other on the regular. It transpired in rushed and desperate mid-night Skype calls or petty arguments stirred by frustration and longing. Their love never wavered under the pressure though, they knew they were together for the long-run. The one that was made of enchanting promises; the one that opened the path to a peaceful yet passionate sense of belonging. The one that eventually led to happy-endings.</p>\n</p>",

They were both exhausted from fighting for almost an hour in her bedroom, and she&rsquo;d kicked him out. She said the word <i>over</i> and he sunk down against the wall in disbelief. The worst part was how calm and unblinking she was about such a life-altering decision.</p><p>He&rsquo;d texted her to come back probably thirty times, but eventually he had to go home. He texted again a few days later, begging her to give them a chance to talk without shouting. He&rsquo;d asked her to meet him in the hallway where it ended so that they could start right where they left off. What he&rsquo;d really been trying to say, instead of <i>meet me in the hallway</i>, is <i>meet me halfway</i>. His thoughts were stuck on a loop of his final text &ndash; <i>please give me another chance</i>.</p><p>He knew he wasn&rsquo;t perfect. She wasn&rsquo;t either, but he wanted to be better for her. He wanted to be the best man he could possibly be so that she&rsquo;d take him back. All he had was the faintest bit of hope and a promise &ndash; he&rsquo;s got to get better, and maybe &ndash; just maybe &ndash; they&rsquo;ll work it out.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Thanks for sending this in! It was surprisingly challenging to turn Harry&rsquo;s own words into a blurb but I enjoyed writing it. Hope you like it! &lt;3 </b><br /></p>\n<p>He tries to think positively &ndash; to hope, to dream, to wonder. <i>Maybe they&rsquo;ll work it out. Maybe she&rsquo;ll show up out of the blue and beg him to take her back. She could be on her way right now, willing to give him another chance.</i></p>\n<p>He tries to think positively because the alternative would be to crumple in a heap on the floor. Gravity has never felt heavier. All he wants to do is collapse and never get up, but something in him is holding on to the chance that she&rsquo;ll come back. And he&rsquo;ll be ready if she does. No. <i>When</i> she does.</p>\n<p>A thousand scenarios run through his head. She could come find him at the studio and say that she missed him too much. She could show up at his home at two in the morning and say that she can&rsquo;t sleep without him by her side. She could contact Gemma or his mum, and explain that she made a mistake in walking away.</p>\n<p>But none of that happens. Harry is left waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting. And the more she doesn&rsquo;t come back, the more he remembers her words from that night &ndash; the night he&rsquo;s spent every day trying to forget since.</p>\n</p>",
