Angst</i></p><p><b>Chapter 47 - Overruled</b></p><p><i>(Proof reading errors likely)</i></p><p><i>A/N: This is a long ass chapter guys, Strap in.</i></p><p>________</p><p>\n\u201cOh Crowleyyyyy,\u201d Lucifer had cooed to him telepathically as Crowley fucked you hard on the throne. \u201cLet&rsquo;s have a private chat,\ndevil to demon.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet stuffed,\u201d Crowley thought back. \u201cBusy here.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re gonna listen because I know you still haven&rsquo;t told her\nabout her parents yet,\u201d comes the derisive response. \u201cThis will\nbe the last time you touch her. Let me out of the bonds of this\nvessel and I&rsquo;ll spare your miserable existence. Don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;ll sing\nlike a canary.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Crowley mentally shrugs. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>\nHe watches Lucifer bluster for a split second before an expression of\nrage comes over his face and then he focuses his attention back to\nyou.</p><p>\nCrowley knew he was trying to converse with you in a similar manner.\nHe couldn&rsquo;t read your thoughts any more because of it. He just hoped you&rsquo;d be\nstrong enough to resist his charms this time. \n</p><!-- more --><p>\nHe uses his essence to help your orgasm along, trying to rip you out\nof the internal conversation and he grunts as he feels you clench and\npulse around him. Then he can hear your thoughts again.</p><p>\n\u201c<i>He&rsquo;s never going to stop</i>,\u201d you kept thinking over and over.\n\u201c<i>He&rsquo;ll never stop until he has me.</i>\u201d</p><p>\nOf all the things in creation that you&rsquo;d fought, Crowley knew\nLucifer&rsquo;s obsession with you scared you the most. Not even a display\nlike this had been a big enough clue for the idiot feather duster that you didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>\nThen he found his own release, his cock twitching inside you. You\nalways felt marvellous around him. So tight, so willing.</p><p>\nThen Crowley&rsquo;s mouth gets the better of him and he&rsquo;s in a war of\nwords with Lucifer, causing the archangel to bristle. That seemed to\nmake you stiffen to an unnatural degree before Crowley leaned around\nand saw your eyes glaze over. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIf it saves the world Dean, what choice do I have? I&rsquo;ll go with\nhim,\u201d you say dully.</p><p>\n\u201cI wonder if she&rsquo;s talking about little old me,\u201d Lucifer grins\ncheekily, looking at Crowley out of the tops of his eyes. \u201cI&rsquo;d like\nto think she&rsquo;d come round to my way of thinking eventually.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t want to run. Don&rsquo;t make me,\u201d you start picking up speed\nin your babbling and Crowley knew he needed to get you out before\nLucifer took this as a sign of victory.</p><p>\nHe appeared with you in the bedroom, quite beside himself with worry\nas he held you close, listening to horrible things that you were\npredicting. They were things that told him there was a choice to\nmake, a choice to save humanity but it was likely that either meant\nyou went with Lucifer or Crowley died. Neither of those were\nappealing. Neither of those he could bear to listen to as you sounded\nlike you were imitating a sobbing voice, <i>your</i> voice from the\nfuture.</p><p><i>Well&hellip;.bloody\nhell.</i></p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\nAfter your phone conversation with Dean, Crowley seems to be looking\nat you intensely. \n</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, there&rsquo;s something I need to tell you,\u201d Crowley starts.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d you automatically say, feeling your\nstomach flip. \u201cYou never use that voice unless you messed up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s something I found out very very recently,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI\njust needed to confirm if it was true or not.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, this might change things between us.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI feel like I&rsquo;m in this for the long game now,\u201d you laugh a\nlittle bitterly. \u201cSo just get it over with. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Crowley blinks. \u201cWho is who?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\u201d your eyes widen. \u201cOkay, you didn&rsquo;t stray then, that&rsquo;s\nsomething.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy on earth would I do that, you certifiable woman?\u201d Crowley is\nbewildered. \u201cWhy would that even enter your mind?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSomething Lucifer said to me just now,\u201d you bite your lip,\nlooking at the sheets.</p><p>\n\u201cIs he speaking to you telepathically?\u201d Crowley becomes very\nangry. \u201cAbominable git! Pet, you are the top of the chain and why\nwould I try and find anything as good as that when there isn&rsquo;t? No I\nhaven&rsquo;t betrayed you. This is to do with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI mean your <i>real</i> parents,\u201d Crowley sighs again. \u201cBefore\nyou and Alistair were adopted.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou mean&hellip;.did you&hellip;.did you kill them or something?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cYour mother, she made a deal,\u201d Crowley tells you. \u201cShe\ncouldn&rsquo;t have children, see. She asked for ten years of fertility so\nI gave them to her. That&rsquo;s how you and your brother came to be. When\nit was time to collect&hellip;.there were more casualties than was\nexpected. It was the Marchioness disaster.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you&rsquo;re saying you had a hand in my birth?\u201d you try and wrap\nyour head around it. \u201cI&rsquo;m not sure whether that&rsquo;s creepy or fate at\nthis point.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou know, I was expecting rather more shouting than is currently\nhappening,\u201d Crowley surveys you.</p><p>\n\u201cI&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know,\u201d you shrug. \u201cI never knew my birth parents.\nIt would be unfair of me to get angry over something like this. You\ndidn&rsquo;t know I would be the product of it. I can&rsquo;t hate you for a\ndecision my mother made.\u201d</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;d never seen the King of Hell relax as much as he did. Crowley\nalmost fell back into the sheets with relief.</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, I love you. You are just the most exquisite example of\nmortal divinity.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf you&rsquo;re going to suggest they&rsquo;ll make me a saint again after I\ndie, I&rsquo;ll throw this pillow at you,\u201d you scowl. \u201cI&rsquo;m nobody&rsquo;s\nangel. I just fucked a demon in front of the devil.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat you did,\u201d Crowley purrs, running a hand along your waist.\n\u201cVery bold and very brave. I know he was trying to speak to you\nmost of the time. Is he saying anything now?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOnly the usual,\u201d you mutter. \u201cThat he&rsquo;ll kill you, he&rsquo;ll kill\nthe Winchesters and I&rsquo;ll be some queen of the dawn or other.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNot if I kill him first,\u201d Crowley grumbles. \u201cI&rsquo;ll pluck him\nand roast him like a Christmas turkey.\u201d</p><p>\nYou wince, hearing that saccharin voice of Lucifer&rsquo;s invading your\nhead again.</p><p><i>Tabbbbbbyyyyyyyyy,\noh my little cutesy wutesy little kitty cat? Answer me baby. Did you\nlike my show for you? I promise you, tonight&rsquo;s will be even better.</i></p><p>\n\u201cHe won&rsquo;t shut up,\u201d you hiss, clenching your hands over your\nears. \u201cI feel like I&rsquo;m going mad.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLet&rsquo;s get you out of Hell. Distance will help,\u201d Crowley frowns,\nredressing you with a snap of his fingers and then vanishing with you\nback into the bunker.</p><p>\nImmediately the archangel&rsquo;s voice dims to where you can&rsquo;t even make\nout individual words. The relief was immense.</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you say earnestly. \u201cBeing a prophet sucks balls.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSuch an interesting turn of phrase,\u201d Crowley chuckles. \u201cAnd\nyes, I&rsquo;ll never forgive God for pulling that little stunt.\u201d</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a flash where you see Crowley in the grey world, screaming in\nagony before it&rsquo;s gone just as suddenly as it started. The more you\nkeep seeing, the more you&rsquo;re certain you&rsquo;re going to lose him. You\njust want to shirk all your hunter responsibilities, spend as much\ntime with Crowley as you can. Then a mad idea comes to you.</p><p>\n\u201cTake me again,\u201d you nip at his neck.</p><p>\n\u201cAlready? Darling, \u00a0I&rsquo;m not a machine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you&rsquo;re not up to it?\u201d you tease. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI may not be a machine but I <i>am</i> Crowley and I am always up for\nravishing you. What&rsquo;s brought this mood on?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI just need you again.\u201d</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a click and you&rsquo;re disrobed before you practically pounce on\nhim. He seems shocked at first but he play fights with you, pinning\nyou to the bed with his demonic essence.</p><p>\n\u201cWicked girl,\u201d he smirks. \u201cAnd all mine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, just fuck me,\u201d you beg.</p><p>\n\u201cHow can I refuse such a pretty request like that?\u201d \n</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re still slick from the sex you had earlier and he has no trouble\ngliding his cock into you, stretching you out around him. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBut let&rsquo;s aim for a quickie,\u201d he whispers in your ear. \u201cI&rsquo;m\nfairly certain there&rsquo;s the Winchester brood not so far away and your\nold colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen come on,\u201d you grab his hips, urging him to roll forward.</p><p>\n\u201cVery <i>very</i> eager,\u201d he purrs. \u201cMy my.\u201d</p><p>\nHe covers your mouth with his hand before taking an almost feral\npace. He&rsquo;s driving himself home, desperately trying to keep his own\nsounds to small groans and curse words in a language you don&rsquo;t\nunderstand. \n</p><p>\n\u201cLet&rsquo;s take the quick method for you, my love,\u201d he rasps and you\ncan see the tendrils of his power snake across your body, feeling\nlike hands were pawing at every inch of you. \u201cCome now, I want to\nfeel you shake in my arms.\u201d</p><p>\nHe mouths at your neck, leaving tiny bites in his wake until you\njerk, your orgasm barrelling across you as you half scream into his\npalm. \n</p><p>\n\u201cOh I do love those noises you make, kitten,\u201d he groans. \u201cI\nshan&rsquo;t be far behind.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, do what you did when Lucifer was riding shotgun,\u201d you\nsay seriously. \u201cSwitch off the thing that makes you infertile.\u201d</p><p>\nHe stops dead, looking horrified, \u201cAbsolutely not! Are you bloody\nmad?! I almost killed you the last time!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd Chuck said I wouldn&rsquo;t have survived <i>that</i> time but didn&rsquo;t say I\nwould <i>never</i> survive it,\u201d you argue. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy are you so insistent, darling?\u201d he looks grave. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBecause I&rsquo;m scared I&rsquo;ll lose you soon and I&rsquo;m trying to cling on\nin any way I can,\u201d you admit.</p><p>\n\u201cOh you silly silly girl,\u201d he kisses all over your face. \u201cIf I\ndie, I wouldn&rsquo;t want you tethered to me in such a way. I&rsquo;d want you\nto move on.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t want to, I want this,\u201d you protest. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIf this is just to be more certain of us rather than you and\nLucifer, Tabitha, do not risk your life. I would infinitely prefer\nyou to go to the Devil for comfort than be ripped apart by my child.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat&rsquo;s my choice to make,\u201d you&rsquo;re getting stubborn now.</p><p>\n\u201cPlease, my love,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI would never be happy\nknowing I&rsquo;d condemned you a second time.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ll get Castiel to check me out. It takes quickly, right? Then I\ncan see if it&rsquo;s worth it. Just for now&hellip;indulge me. If all these\nvisions are leading where I think they&rsquo;re leading, I want something\nof you here still.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou are a hopeless romantic, Miss Hetherington,\u201d his eyes\ntwinkle a little. \u201cAnd I don&rsquo;t deserve such fierce love. Very well,\nI&rsquo;ll do what you ask but if there&rsquo;s the slightest sense of you dying,\nI&rsquo;ll stop this in its tracks, understand?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNow, where were we, ah yes. Here.\u201d</p><p>\nHe drives hard into you and you swear like a sailor, raking his back\nwhich makes him only pound harder. He&rsquo;s chasing his release quickly,\nstill keen not to get caught by anyone in the bunker. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI love you, you idiotic hunter,\u201d he breathes before pushing as\nfar as he can go, spilling into you with a coarse grunt. \n</p><p>\nIt&rsquo;s much the same sensation as last time. There&rsquo;s a soreness and\npressure in your abdomen that wouldn&rsquo;t usually happen with sex. You\nfeel a lot hungrier already.</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s taken,\u201d Crowley announces. \u201cI still think you&rsquo;re a bloody\nlunatic for doing this but I will never deny you what you want, my\nkitten. If this is to be my legacy then for the love of all things\nsacred, do <i>not</i> give them a traditional Scottish name.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell what else goes with MacLeod?\u201d you snort. \u201cOr is the last\nname to be Crowley?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cOh please spare me the indignation of passing my family name\ndown,\u201d he rolls his eyes. \u201cUse your own. It&rsquo;s much more elegant.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley I-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know, pet, I know. I&rsquo;m frightened too. Being told by your lover\nthat you&rsquo;ve got a time limit is not an easy thing to process.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI just didn&rsquo;t want you unprepared.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d he nods. \u201cI can make preparations now. I assume I\nbite the dust during some prize fight with Lucifer so I hope it looks\ngood at least. Does it happen&hellip;.soon?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI think the closer I get the more visions I have.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell&hellip;.buggeration then.\u201d</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou rejoined the little hunting party in the bunker after that,\nbeelining straight for Sam and Dean and giving them a hug. They\nreturn it wholeheartedly, squishing you all into a trio of limbs.</p><p>\n\u201cHey, good to see you too, princess,\u201d Dean chuckles. \u201cMiss us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh definitely,\u201d you roll your eyes. \u201cI always love having\nsomebody around to fight me for the last muffin in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCompetition is healthy,\u201d Dean winks.</p><p>\n\u201cPretty sure it&rsquo;s not, Dean,\u201d Sam sighs. \u201cEverything okay with\nyou? I know you had to face Toni again.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI almost shot her but I&rsquo;m good,\u201d you step back, trying to see if\nthey were still around. \u201cDo we have company or is it just us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust us but..uh&hellip;.mom wants to speak to you,\u201d Sam shifts\nawkwardly.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat happened? Did something go wrong?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNah, nothing like that,\u201d Dean shakes his head. \u201cThink she just\nwants to run something by you. She&rsquo;s in the library.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlright, I&rsquo;ll swing by there now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGood, I need to speak to Crowley about the Kelly situation.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLet&rsquo;s have a little t\u00eate a t\u00eate then,\u201d Crowley sits down at\nthe table. \u201cPool our resources together because the last thing I\nwant is an heir of Lucifer\u2019s challenging my claim to the throne.\u201d</p><p>\nYou leave them to it, wandering into the library and seeing Mary\nlooking over some gadgets and weapons that you know Mick has provided\nher. You missed having access to stuff like this but it also showed\nyou didn&rsquo;t need fancy items to get the job done.</p><p>\n\u201cAh good,\u201d she smiles kindly at you. \u201cCome here. I need a girl\nchat.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe&rsquo;re not going to talk about boys, are we?\u201d you hesitate.\n\u201cBecause I&rsquo;m woefully inadequate in that area.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell, for a start, you&rsquo;re dating a demon and not a boy,\u201d she\nlaughs. \u201cBut I get your point. No, this is to do with the Men of\nLetters as a whole.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWere they okay with you? If they hurt you in any way-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m fine,\u201d she places a hand on your shoulder. \u201cI\njust&hellip;.Mick&rsquo;s a good guy. I think he really does actually wanna make\na go of this alliance.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ve never had a problem with Mick,\u201d you say honestly. \u201cMy\nproblem is with Toni&hellip;and sometimes with Ketch depending on whether\nhe&rsquo;s chasing me or not.\u201d</p><p>\nThere was something about the way Mary&rsquo;s eyes flashed when you\nmentioned Ketch that you couldn&rsquo;t help but notice. It was strange,\nalmost like&hellip;</p><p>\n\u201cAre you&hellip;.<i>involved</i> with Ketch?\u201d you probe.</p><p>\n\u201cHunters,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThey see everything. We may\nhave&hellip;.bonded whilst going to fetch my boys. He&rsquo;s not as scary as\nhis reputation.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know he isn&rsquo;t but he&rsquo;s dangerous in other ways,\u201d you say\nfirmly, trying to make her understand. \u201cHe&rsquo;s never fallen in love\nin the whole time I&rsquo;ve known him and that&rsquo;s almost some two decades\nnow.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m not after love, sweetie. Just a connection. For me, it&rsquo;s only\nbeen about a few weeks since I was with John, remember? Just promise\nme that you won&rsquo;t tell Sam and Dean, okay? I don&rsquo;t think they need to\nget protective.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s not my place to tell them. If you really want this alliance\nthen I&rsquo;ll go along with it but I really can&rsquo;t promise I won&rsquo;t shoot\nToni if she gets out of line. There&rsquo;s something bad coming and it\nmakes her petty jealously look incredibly insignificant in the grand\nscheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHow bad?\u201d Mary&rsquo;s face falls.</p><p>\n\u201cSomeone&rsquo;s going to die and I&rsquo;m not sure whether it&rsquo;ll be me or\nCrowley,\u201d you confide in her. \u201cPlease don&rsquo;t tell anyone that\neither. A secret for a secret.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, I&rsquo;ll try my damnedest to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.\nYou&rsquo;re becoming part of the family, I mean, hell you&rsquo;re already a\npart of Dean and Sam&rsquo;s family.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell if we&rsquo;re all keeping secrets then yeah, I&rsquo;m a Winchester,\u201d\nyou laugh.</p><p>\n\u201cSometimes I wish we were a normal family again,\u201d Mary looks off\nwistfully. \u201cI miss those days I used to cook Dean pancakes and read\nto Sam at night. Azazel stole my best years with them.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNow you have a chance to reconnect.\u201d</p><p>\nShe puts her arm around your shoulders, squashing you to her fondly,\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re right. Now, tell me everything about these prophecies you\nhave. I&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nFive weeks pass and Lucifer never delivers on his promise to give you\na &lsquo;show&rsquo;. In fact, you don&rsquo;t dream at all in that time.</p><p>\nYou go on hunts with Sam, Dean, Mary and Ketch. Toni is left behind\non your insistence, helping Mick to wrangle the American hunter\nnetwork that you&rsquo;ve told them about, giving over your contact lists. \n</p><p>\nSurprisingly it works well. The access to the gadgets makes hunting\nso much easier and what would have taken four days takes one. The\ndatabase of lore from the Cambridge headquarters speeds up research\ntime also, although Mick primarily takes charge of that for you.</p><p>\nThe only awkward thing is Mary keeps relying on you to cover for her\nwhilst she sneaks off with Ketch. You feel a little like a high\nschooler, trying to protect a friend from their parents finding out. \n</p><p>\nCrowley keeps visiting often, checking in on how you&rsquo;re doing and\nbringing you to Hell where he can lie with you some nights. With all\nthe increase in monster activity, you&rsquo;ve both not be able to get five\nminutes to call Castiel to assess you but as you&rsquo;re cuddled into\nCrowley&rsquo;s arms, stark naked under the silk sheets, you get the shock\nof your life when the angel appears at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\n\u201cReally, Feathers, I think you&rsquo;re starting to enjoy this,\u201d\nCrowley raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou have a habit of dropping in when\nclothing&rsquo;s been shed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere was no time to send warning. Fabric is immaterial to the\nconversation,\u201d Castiel says in a slightly more animated voice than\nusual. \u201cI have Kelly Kline.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIn your trenchcoat pocket?\u201d Crowley sasses.</p><p>\n\u201cObviously not,\u201d the angel frowns. \u201cIn a safe location. I need\nto speak with Tabitha before I consult Sam and Dean. I feel she would\nbe more receptive to what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Crowley waves his hand. \u201cBut I would\nlike you to do something for her.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m pregnant again,\u201d you take a deep breath. \u201cCrowley wants to\nknow if I&rsquo;ll survive it.\u201d</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;ve never seen quite an expression like it on Castiel&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s\nalmost like a disappointed parent.</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, how is this keeping her safe like our agreement?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe asked me to,\u201d Crowley holds up both hands. \u201cBegged me to,\nin fact. So please, indulge me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy would you choose this?\u201d Castiel seems baffled. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ve got my reasons,\u201d you murmur. \u201cProphet type reasons.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan&rsquo;t ignore the word of God, can we?\u201d Crowley chips in.</p><p>\n\u201cI frequently have ignored the word of God,\u201d Castiel moves to\nyou. \u201cI&rsquo;m the 'rebel angel&rsquo;, remember? God was not what I expected\neither.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes, yes, just assess her you monotonous twit,\u201d Crowley rolls\nhis eyes.</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a funny feeling as Castiel moves his hand over your stomach\nand you see the soft glow of a light underneath his fingers. He\nfurrows his brow, concentrating hard until he steps back.</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re dying this time. When Lucifer was in my\nvessel, he did this and the sensation is different.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo she&rsquo;ll survive it?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cI believe so, providing nothing kills her beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEver the ray of sunshine,\u201d Crowley sighs before kissing your\nforehead. \u201cWell that&rsquo;s one blessed relief.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about, Cas?\u201d you ask. \u201cI can&rsquo;t\nexactly get up right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI have seen naked humans before. I was there at the creation,\u201d\nCastiel says bluntly. \u201cBut I understand your discomfort. Very well,\nmy issue is that I do not want to kill Kelly&rsquo;s baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, come again?\u201d Crowley blinks. \u201cA nephilim and you\ndon&rsquo;t want to smite it?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe&rsquo;s different.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe?\u201d you&rsquo;re confused.</p><p>\n\u201cWhen I found Kelly, she had attempted suicide. She was being held\nby Dagon. Evidently Crowley, you are not keeping favour in Hell. The\nPrinces are trying to protect the baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet to the point, Cas,\u201d you interrupt.</p><p>\n\u201cYes, well then. The baby brought Kelly back to life and showed me\na future where peace reigned. I believe this child will help the\nworld. I cannot destroy it. The reason I am telling you, Tabitha, is\nbecause you understand. You believe in Crowley so much you want to\ntry and have his child again even though he is a demon. Do you think\nyour child would be inherently evil?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t know. I would like to believe in nurture versus nature.\nThere are monsters that can reject their nature out there.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThis is my point. Nephilims from any other angel would not be\nconsidered evil but there is an assumption that because it is\nLucifer&rsquo;s that it will be bad,\u201d Castiel nods. \u201cThis child is not\nbad. This child is good, I can see that. Can you trust my judgement?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Crowley cuts in. \u201cThis is Lucifer&rsquo;s child. Think\nvery carefully. If you let it live, if Lucifer lives-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt was in one of my visions,\u201d you sigh. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou saw that the child lives?\u201d Castiel asks.</p><p>\n\u201cYes. Lucifer mentioned something about \u2018picking up his kid\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen it has to live. If we try to subvert fate, it could be\ncatastrophic.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut the end result is catastrophic according to her visions. If we\nhave a chance to change the course of destiny then why not?\u201d\nCrowley becomes frustrated. \u201cLet&rsquo;s eliminate one of the variables\nright now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut if this variable brings peace and balance then that is\nselfish,\u201d Castiel matches his tone. \u201cHow did you feel when God\nkilled <i>your</i> child?\u201d</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a streak of colour that goes across your vision and a blur of\nred as you realise Crowley has launched himself at the angel,\ndragging the bedsheets along with him. You manage to whip a pillow in\nfront of you to keep your modesty before rushing to the chair where\nCrowley&rsquo;s overcoat is, rapidly pulling it onto yourself before you\ntry and intervene.</p><p>\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Crowley roars, fighting with Castiel, completely\nnaked, grabbing him into a headlock. \u201cDo not use my own tragedy for\nyour idiotic arguments! You divine pond scum!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, stop it!\u201d you yell, trying to pull him off but Crowley\nwas infinitely stronger than you were.</p><p>\n\u201cI ought to rip you apart!\u201d Crowley continues shouting whilst\nCastiel struggles out of his grip.</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m trying to save humanity!\u201d Castiel chokes out.</p><p>\n\u201cDo so on your own dime, you insensitive wretch!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSTOP FIGHTING!\u201d you get in the middle of them. \u201cCas made a\nmistake, okay. It was a poor choice of words.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re lucky she&rsquo;s here,\u201d Crowley snarls, pointing at Castiel.</p><p>\n\u201cGo get some scotch and calm down,\u201d you send him out.</p><p>\nCrowley glares before snapping some clothes on himself and stalking\nout. You take a deep breath before turning to the angel who was\nprofoundly ruffled.</p><p>\n\u201cYou don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking of him,\u201d you straighten out\nhis tie. \u201cMy visions have been leading me to the conclusion that if\nthings play out then Crowley dies and I might have to go with\nLucifer.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAh. Forgive me, I did not know.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you&rsquo;re asking him to choose between the child&rsquo;s death or his\ndeath and my possible enslavement. He&rsquo;s not going to readily agree.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan I show you? I just need someone to understand me,\u201d he holds\nout two fingers hesitantly.</p><p>\n\u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><p>\nIt&rsquo;s hard to describe the scene you see. It&rsquo;s overwhelming in a way.\nYou just know an innate sense of peace, of relaxation. It&rsquo;s like\nyou&rsquo;re standing on top of a mountain watching the sun rise. It&rsquo;s\njust&hellip;hopeful. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThis is the vision the child gave to me. That is his intentions.\nHe only wants to help. He&hellip;uh&hellip;.wants me to mentor him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe wants you to be his dad instead?\u201d you blink as the room comes\nback into focus. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIn a sense,\u201d Castiel nods. \u201cBut that is what I want to fight\nfor.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan he keep me and Crowley safe?\u201d you ask.</p><p>\n\u201cIf he senses no ill will from you then yes he will because I will\ntell him you are good people&hellip;well, <i>you</i> are a good person.\nYour child will no doubt be a good person.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf this is the gamble we have to take to bring everlasting\npeace&hellip;.I suppose I&rsquo;ve nearly died for less,\u201d you take a breath.</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the angel grabs your shoulders, looking at you\nintensely. \u201cI knew you would understand me. You are my greatest\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou don&rsquo;t need to butter me up, you know. I already agreed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou agreed?\u201d comes Crowley&rsquo;s voice as he returns with a large\nbottle of Craig he&rsquo;s drinking directly from. \u201cI could swear you&rsquo;ve\nlost your marbles lately, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThis nephilim can keep us safe,\u201d you reiterate. \u201cHonestly,\nthis is the most hopeful I&rsquo;ve been since I started having these\nstupid prophecies.\u201d</p><p>\nCrowley&rsquo;s face falls a little at that. He knows he can&rsquo;t argue.\nAnything to cling onto was better than blind faith that the world\nwould right itself.</p><p>\n\u201cFeathers, leave us,\u201d Crowley dismisses Castiel with a wave. \u201cI\nneed to talk to her alone.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cVery well. I will update Tabitha on how Kelly is progressing and\nkeep an eye on her own pregnancy also.\u201d</p><p>\nThen he vanishes.</p><p>\nCrowley just stands there, one hand massaging his temple. He looks\nweary, older. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIs this really all we have to look forward to?\u201d he mutters. \u201cI\ndie and you become Lucifer&rsquo;s plaything?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat choice do we have? You know how fighting destiny goes. It&rsquo;s\nonly subvertable at the last second with the Winchesters involved.\u201d</p><p>\nCrowley snorts inelegantly, \u201cFair point, well made. Well&hellip;.at\nleast there is one glimmer of hope now. If you believe this child can\nhelp, I trust you. At least mine will not kill you. I can take great\nstock that my legacy will live on.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDoesn&rsquo;t matter,\u201d he comes over to you, kissing you so messily\nyou can taste the alcohol. \u201cAnything as long as it&rsquo;s ours.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI love you. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, I don&rsquo;t think there was a grand enough gesture like\nsuicidally getting me to knock you up just so you could keep\nsomething of me around,\u201d he smirks. \u201cMakes a demon feel wanted.\nNow, I must insist that if I am to get the rest of this pent up\nenergy out that I thoroughly fuck you right here and now in my coat\nbecause it looks simply criminal on you.\u201d</p><p>\nThe next thing you know you&rsquo;re being thrown on the bed.</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n\u201cOh Tabbbbbyyyyyy,\u201d comes that voice.</p><p>\n\u201cGo away,\u201d you hiss.</p><p>\n\u201cAww come on, sweetcheeks. I gave you a few weeks reprieve. Wasn&rsquo;t\nthat kind of me?\u201d Lucifer pouts. \u201cI hear we&rsquo;re getting to the\nendgame. These demons looooove to gossip. You&rsquo;ve been having visions\nabout me, haven&rsquo;t you? Visions where you come to me of your own free\nwill?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGO AWAY!\u201d you say more strongly.</p><p>\n\u201cNuh uh,\u201d he wags a finger. \u201cSee, I remember your reaction when\nI projected that little image into your nugget. You weren&rsquo;t exactly\nhorrified. I didn&rsquo;t ruin your fun with Crowley. That says to me that\non some level, you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust stop hounding me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDon&rsquo;t deny yourself what you want,\u201d he&rsquo;s approaching you. \u201cYou\nwant me. I know you do. You&rsquo;re just scared of hurting Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m not-\u201d</p><p>\nThen the world dissolves into that room. You&rsquo;re by a large bay\nwindow, the doors open wide as the summer breeze tickles at your\nskin. You can feel the heat, magnified through the glass, bathing you\nas you look out at the view.</p><p>\n\u201cMy love,\u201d Lucifer says from behind you.</p><p>\nYou turn to see him, shirtless, his wings in a relaxed position. He\u2019s\njust bathing in the flow of the sun like you are.</p><p>\nYou can&rsquo;t control your actions as you move towards him, placing a\nhand on his chest and snaking it up to his neck. You usually have a\nmodicum of control in these kind of dreams but it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re\nviewing a movie through your own perspective.</p><p>\n\u201cYou have no idea how happy you made me when you chose to come with\nme,\u201d Lucifer murmurs softly.</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ll admit, at first I thought you were just obsessed. Like a\nteenage crush or something,\u201d you hear your own voice say.</p><p>\n\u201cNo, Tabitha. It&rsquo;s love,\u201d he pushes your hair back behind your\near. \u201cIt&rsquo;s a bond, it&rsquo;s unity. You are mine and I am yours.\u201d</p><p>\nYour hand drags up to the bridge of his wing before tracing gently\nthrough the feathers. He sighs contentedly, pulling you closer.</p><p>\n\u201cI will never let you go,\u201d he leans down, capturing your lips in\na kiss.</p><p>\nSurely dreams should not be this tactile? Surely you should not be\nable to feel the warmth of his breath, the caress of his fingers, the\nchill of his skin? You also caught a waft of scent now and then as\nhis wings rippled, the smell of a warm summer&rsquo;s evening.</p><p>\nWas this a dream? Was it <i>just</i> a dream? Could this be&hellip;a prophecy?\nWas this what was to come after the grey world?</p><p>\nYou found your emotions getting more and more tangled as Lucifer\ndeepened the kiss and you remembered the last time you&rsquo;d done this,\nwhen you&rsquo;d done this willingly. It was confusing knowing how serene\nand almost gentleman-like he could be contrasted with his vicious and\nspiteful side. \n</p><p>\nThen it was like you&rsquo;d blinked because one second you were upright\nand kissing him and the next you were on the bed. Lucifer was naked\nabove you and you had no clothes on either. You might have been\nchilled to the bone with Lucifer&rsquo;s temperature but somehow the baking\nsunlight coming through the windows was keeping you warm.</p><p>\n\u201cIt will be my honour to claim you as mine,\u201d Lucifer smiles\nlopsidedly. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThen do it,\u201d your voice is full of lust.</p><p>\n\u201cAfter I properly revere you.\u201d</p><p>\nHe wanted to explore every inch of you, mouthing at you, kissing you,\nbiting you. You felt relaxed, you felt peaceful as his mouth hovered\nin between your legs.</p><p>\n\u201cI never got to taste such a pure creature last time,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>\nThen the scene flips again and there&rsquo;s this almost heavy feeling in\nyour legs like you get after an orgasm. Lucifer&rsquo;s fully on top of\nyou, cock ready and waiting as he searches your face for permission.</p><p>\n\u201cSay yes to me, Tabitha. Say yes to being mine and I swear I will\nkeep you safe for eternity. You will be mine, you&rsquo;ll bear my family,\nyou&rsquo;ll fight alongside me against our enemies. Say yes.\u201d</p><p>\nHe kisses you hard and you can feel him press his cock to your\nentrance, holding himself back with great difficulty.</p><p>\n\u201cSay yes to me.\u201d</p><p>\nTo your horror, the next words you say are, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\nThe next sensation you feel is being full, so full you&rsquo;re being\nstretched as he eases into you. How can you feel that with such\nperfect detail?!</p><p>\n\u201cYou make me so happy,\u201d he murmurs before fully driving himself\nin to the hilt.</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou awake with a start, flailing as though the spectre of the Dream\nLucifer could be pushed off you. You&rsquo;re mortified to realise there&rsquo;s\na dull throbbing ache between your legs, that you got aroused by what\nyou had seen. \n</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re just lucky Crowley wasn&rsquo;t next to you because you know he\nwould&rsquo;ve heard your panicked thoughts just now. He didn&rsquo;t need to\nknow how much you were being tormented by this.</p><p><i>Did\nyou enjoy that? Oh you did, you bad baaaaad girl. Come see what&rsquo;s\nkickin&rsquo; in the throne room, Tabby. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll love it.</i></p><p>\nYou hastily scramble, pulling on jeans and a t-shirt before rushing\nout to the throne room, past several demons who give excited\nwhispers. You throw open the double doors to see Crowley on the floor\nand Lucifer on the throne, one leg crooked over the arm rest.</p><p>\n\u201cHi cupcake,\u201d he smiles sweetly at you. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhat&rsquo;s going on?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, get out!\u201d Crowley roars through his pain.</p><p>\nLucifer flicks his wrist and you hear an audible crack as Crowley&rsquo;s\nback seems to bend unnaturally far backwards.</p><p>\n\u201cStop it!\u201d you yell, running forward to grab him, to protect him.</p><p>\n\u201cHmmm, nah,\u201d Lucifer shrugs. \u201cHe was mean to me. I don&rsquo;t like\nmean people. Hey, here&rsquo;s a neat idea. I&rsquo;ll tell you something that\nCrowley did that&rsquo;ll mean you don&rsquo;t like him any more.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf it&rsquo;s about my parents, I already know,\u201d you fire back.</p><p>\nLucifer gives a moody pout before drumming his fingers on the arm\nrests of the throne, \u201cCrowley, you&rsquo;re no fun. I expected you to be\nmore of a coward.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBite me,\u201d Crowley growls back, gritting his teeth through the\npain.</p><p>\n\u201cYou know, I might, so don&rsquo;t test me,\u201d Lucifer snarls. \u201cFineeee,\nhow about this then, Crowley? I&rsquo;ve been sending sex dreams to Tabitha\nfor weeks now and she just <i>loves</i> them, don&rsquo;t you baby?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf by love you mean I want to claw my own brain out after them\nthen yeah,\u201d you hiss. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Why not\nshack up with Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cKelly was sweet and all but she had no fire,\u201d Lucifer muses.\n\u201cYou, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re the only human female in creation\nthat&rsquo;s told me no. You&rsquo;re the only one who ever tried to understand\nme. You are the human I&rsquo;m meant to have so if Crowley could just&hellip;I\ndon&rsquo;t know&hellip;die? Gee, that would be swell.\u201d</p><p>\nAnother crack as Crowley&rsquo;s arm snaps in two and you&rsquo;re trying to hold\nhim as he falls sideways.</p><p>\n\u201cCas!\u201d you shout.</p><p>\n\u201cOh, that&rsquo;s disappointing,\u201d Lucifer leans forward. \u201cMy little\nbro ain&rsquo;t gonna help this. I&rsquo;ll find you. I always will. I hope\nyou&rsquo;re good at being a stepmom by the way.\u201d</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a flap of wings behind you before you&rsquo;re deposited in the\nbunker, screaming your lungs out for the boys. There&rsquo;s a crash as\ndoors open and the running of footsteps before Sam, Dean and Mary\nburst into your bedroom. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?!\u201d Dean says in alarm, taking in\nCrowley&rsquo;s near unconscious state. \n</p><p>\n\u201cLucifer,\u201d Castiel says for you. \u201cAppears he came for the\nthrone of Hell. He&rsquo;s in his old vessel.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Dean mutters. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cPeachy,\u201d Crowley groans. \n</p><p>\n\u201cHe&rsquo;s going to go after Kelly,\u201d you tell Castiel. \u201cHe kept\nsaying he wants me to be a stepmum to the kid. Go make sure she&rsquo;s\nfine.\u201d</p><p>\nThe angel disappears.</p><p>\n\u201cTell us what the hell is going on, Tabitha,\u201d Sam kneels down,\nhelping you bring Crowley onto the bed.</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley found Lucifer&rsquo;s essence and stuffed it into a vessel that\nwas bound with bits of the cage,\u201d you rattle off. \u201cSomehow he\nbroke out of the control. He was meant to be contained until we could\nget Kelly&rsquo;s kid but it didn&rsquo;t work.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHow long have you known this?\u201d Dean asks suspiciously.</p><p>\n\u201cLike a month,\u201d you meet his gaze defiantly.</p><p>\n\u201cTabs, we said no more secrets,\u201d Dean sighs long and hard.\n\u201cSweetheart, you need to start trusting us more. We could&rsquo;ve\nhelped.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTrust me, you couldn&rsquo;t,\u201d you stand up. \u201cHe would&rsquo;ve said\nanything to you to rile you up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo we need to go get to Kelly,\u201d Mary cuts in. \u201cThat&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m\ntaking from this. Correct?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes, we need to move now. I assume Cas has told you about his\nplans?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah but we still think he&rsquo;s nuts for it,\u201d Sam adds. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI am perfectly stable,\u201d Castiel says as he reappears. \u201cKelly\nsays&hellip;uh&hellip;well she shouted that her water has broken. I need\nassistance.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTake us all,\u201d you say firmly. \u201cI think this is going to be the\nlast stand off soon.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re not going anywhere without us,\u201d Toni says from the\ndoorway, flanked by Mick.</p><p>\n\u201cDo you live here now?!\u201d you hiss.</p><p>\n\u201cTrust me, I wouldn&rsquo;t choose to live somewhere this odious,\u201d she\ncurls her lip. \u201cBut you&rsquo;re not letting a nephilim be born. It&rsquo;s\nagainst the code.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe&rsquo;s right, Tabitha,\u201d Mick nods. \u201cIt&rsquo;s too powerful.\u201d</p><p>\nToni holds up a gun whilst Mick uses a knife to slice open his palm,\ndrawing the angel banishing sigil on the wall.</p><p>\n\u201cDon&rsquo;t you dare, you Brit dickbags!\u201d Dean yells.</p><p>\n\u201cOnly way, mate,\u201d Mick shrugs apologetically.</p><p>\nBefore he can slam his hand on it, there&rsquo;s two gunshots and blood\nexplodes from their faces. They drop to the floor, bodies thudding\nheavily to reveal Ketch standing behind them.</p><p>\n\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d you shout. \u201cArthur?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTheir termination orders had come through,\u201d he says quaintly,\nimperceptibly nodding at Mary.</p><p>\nYou knew that was bollocks. More likely he&rsquo;d done it before he was\nafraid for Mary&rsquo;s safety but it still shocked you. You looked away\nfrom the bodies on the floor, trying not to process it.</p><p>\n\u201cLet&rsquo;s go,\u201d Castiel says, healing Crowley before gathering\neveryone in a circle once they had tooled up.</p><p>\n\u201cGo Team Free Will,\u201d Dean says grimly. \u201cEnd of days part sixty\nfive.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEveryone ready?\u201d Sam asks.</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\u201d you murmur quietly. \u201cBut let&rsquo;s do this anyway.\u201d</p><p>\nYou give one last scared look to Crowley who returns it before you\nvanish out of the bunker.</p><p>_____\u00a0</p><p>Taglist:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <strike>@wolfygecko</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_LK6GlOtQQcl2UWq0WM-g\">@fairytale07</a></p>",

He just hoped you\u2019d be\nstrong enough to resist his charms this time. \n</p>[[MORE]]<p>\nHe uses his essence to help your orgasm along, trying to rip you out\nof the internal conversation and he grunts as he feels you clench and\npulse around him. Then he can hear your thoughts again.</p><p>\n\u201c<i>He\u2019s never going to stop</i>,\u201d you kept thinking over and over.\n\u201c<i>He\u2019ll never stop until he has me.</i>\u201d</p><p>\nOf all the things in creation that you\u2019d fought, Crowley knew\nLucifer\u2019s obsession with you scared you the most. Not even a display\nlike this had been a big enough clue for the idiot feather duster that you didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>\nThen he found his own release, his cock twitching inside you. You\nalways felt marvellous around him. So tight, so willing.</p><p>\nThen Crowley\u2019s mouth gets the better of him and he\u2019s in a war of\nwords with Lucifer, causing the archangel to bristle. That seemed to\nmake you stiffen to an unnatural degree before Crowley leaned around\nand saw your eyes glaze over. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIf it saves the world Dean, what choice do I have? I\u2019ll go with\nhim,\u201d you say dully.</p><p>\n\u201cI wonder if she\u2019s talking about little old me,\u201d Lucifer grins\ncheekily, looking at Crowley out of the tops of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like\nto think she\u2019d come round to my way of thinking eventually.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to run. Don\u2019t make me,\u201d you start picking up speed\nin your babbling and Crowley knew he needed to get you out before\nLucifer took this as a sign of victory.</p><p>\nHe appeared with you in the bedroom, quite beside himself with worry\nas he held you close, listening to horrible things that you were\npredicting. They were things that told him there was a choice to\nmake, a choice to save humanity but it was likely that either meant\nyou went with Lucifer or Crowley died. Neither of those were\nappealing. Neither of those he could bear to listen to as you sounded\nlike you were imitating a sobbing voice, <i>your</i> voice from the\nfuture.</p><p><i>Well\u2026.bloody\nhell.</i></p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nAfter your phone conversation with Dean, Crowley seems to be looking\nat you intensely. \n</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, there\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d Crowley starts.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d you automatically say, feeling your\nstomach flip. \u201cYou never use that voice unless you messed up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I found out very very recently,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI\njust needed to confirm if it was true or not.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, this might change things between us.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in this for the long game now,\u201d you laugh a\nlittle bitterly. \u201cSo just get it over with. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Crowley blinks. \u201cWho is who?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\u201d your eyes widen. \u201cOkay, you didn\u2019t stray then, that\u2019s\nsomething.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy on earth would I do that, you certifiable woman?\u201d Crowley is\nbewildered. \u201cWhy would that even enter your mind?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSomething Lucifer said to me just now,\u201d you bite your lip,\nlooking at the sheets.</p><p>\n\u201cIs he speaking to you telepathically?\u201d Crowley becomes very\nangry. \u201cAbominable git! Pet, you are the top of the chain and why\nwould I try and find anything as good as that when there isn\u2019t? No I\nhaven\u2019t betrayed you. This is to do with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI mean your <i>real</i> parents,\u201d Crowley sighs again. \u201cBefore\nyou and Alistair were adopted.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou mean\u2026.did you\u2026.did you kill them or something?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cYour mother, she made a deal,\u201d Crowley tells you. \u201cShe\ncouldn\u2019t have children, see. She asked for ten years of fertility so\nI gave them to her. That\u2019s how you and your brother came to be. When\nit was time to collect\u2026.there were more casualties than was\nexpected. It was the Marchioness disaster.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you had a hand in my birth?\u201d you try and wrap\nyour head around it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s creepy or fate at\nthis point.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou know, I was expecting rather more shouting than is currently\nhappening,\u201d Crowley surveys you.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know,\u201d you shrug. \u201cI never knew my birth parents.\nIt would be unfair of me to get angry over something like this. You\ndidn\u2019t know I would be the product of it. I can\u2019t hate you for a\ndecision my mother made.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\u2019d never seen the King of Hell relax as much as he did. Crowley\nalmost fell back into the sheets with relief.</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, I love you. You are just the most exquisite example of\nmortal divinity.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to suggest they\u2019ll make me a saint again after I\ndie, I\u2019ll throw this pillow at you,\u201d you scowl. \u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s\nangel. I just fucked a demon in front of the devil.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat you did,\u201d Crowley purrs, running a hand along your waist.\n\u201cVery bold and very brave. I know he was trying to speak to you\nmost of the time. Is he saying anything now?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOnly the usual,\u201d you mutter. \u201cThat he\u2019ll kill you, he\u2019ll kill\nthe Winchesters and I\u2019ll be some queen of the dawn or other.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNot if I kill him first,\u201d Crowley grumbles. \u201cI\u2019ll pluck him\nand roast him like a Christmas turkey.\u201d</p><p>\nYou wince, hearing that saccharin voice of Lucifer\u2019s invading your\nhead again.</p><p><i>Tabbbbbbyyyyyyyyy,\noh my little cutesy wutesy little kitty cat? Answer me baby. Did you\nlike my show for you? I promise you, tonight\u2019s will be even better.</i></p><p>\n\u201cHe won\u2019t shut up,\u201d you hiss, clenching your hands over your\nears. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going mad.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of Hell. Distance will help,\u201d Crowley frowns,\nredressing you with a snap of his fingers and then vanishing with you\nback into the bunker.</p><p>\nImmediately the archangel\u2019s voice dims to where you can\u2019t even make\nout individual words. The relief was immense.</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you say earnestly. \u201cBeing a prophet sucks balls.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSuch an interesting turn of phrase,\u201d Crowley chuckles. \u201cAnd\nyes, I\u2019ll never forgive God for pulling that little stunt.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a flash where you see Crowley in the grey world, screaming in\nagony before it\u2019s gone just as suddenly as it started. The more you\nkeep seeing, the more you\u2019re certain you\u2019re going to lose him. You\njust want to shirk all your hunter responsibilities, spend as much\ntime with Crowley as you can. Then a mad idea comes to you.</p><p>\n\u201cTake me again,\u201d you nip at his neck.</p><p>\n\u201cAlready? Darling, \u00a0I\u2019m not a machine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not up to it?\u201d you tease. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI may not be a machine but I <i>am</i> Crowley and I am always up for\nravishing you. What\u2019s brought this mood on?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI just need you again.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a click and you\u2019re disrobed before you practically pounce on\nhim. He seems shocked at first but he play fights with you, pinning\nyou to the bed with his demonic essence.</p><p>\n\u201cWicked girl,\u201d he smirks. \u201cAnd all mine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, just fuck me,\u201d you beg.</p><p>\n\u201cHow can I refuse such a pretty request like that?\u201d \n</p><p>\nYou\u2019re still slick from the sex you had earlier and he has no trouble\ngliding his cock into you, stretching you out around him. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBut let\u2019s aim for a quickie,\u201d he whispers in your ear. \u201cI\u2019m\nfairly certain there\u2019s the Winchester brood not so far away and your\nold colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen come on,\u201d you grab his hips, urging him to roll forward.</p><p>\n\u201cVery <i>very</i> eager,\u201d he purrs. \u201cMy my.\u201d</p><p>\nHe covers your mouth with his hand before taking an almost feral\npace. He\u2019s driving himself home, desperately trying to keep his own\nsounds to small groans and curse words in a language you don\u2019t\nunderstand. \n</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s take the quick method for you, my love,\u201d he rasps and you\ncan see the tendrils of his power snake across your body, feeling\nlike hands were pawing at every inch of you. \u201cCome now, I want to\nfeel you shake in my arms.\u201d</p><p>\nHe mouths at your neck, leaving tiny bites in his wake until you\njerk, your orgasm barrelling across you as you half scream into his\npalm. \n</p><p>\n\u201cOh I do love those noises you make, kitten,\u201d he groans. \u201cI\nshan\u2019t be far behind.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, do what you did when Lucifer was riding shotgun,\u201d you\nsay seriously. \u201cSwitch off the thing that makes you infertile.\u201d</p><p>\nHe stops dead, looking horrified, \u201cAbsolutely not! Are you bloody\nmad?! I almost killed you the last time!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd Chuck said I wouldn\u2019t have survived <i>that</i> time but didn\u2019t say I\nwould <i>never</i> survive it,\u201d you argue. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy are you so insistent, darling?\u201d he looks grave. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll lose you soon and I\u2019m trying to cling on\nin any way I can,\u201d you admit.</p><p>\n\u201cOh you silly silly girl,\u201d he kisses all over your face. \u201cIf I\ndie, I wouldn\u2019t want you tethered to me in such a way. I\u2019d want you\nto move on.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to, I want this,\u201d you protest. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIf this is just to be more certain of us rather than you and\nLucifer, Tabitha, do not risk your life. I would infinitely prefer\nyou to go to the Devil for comfort than be ripped apart by my child.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s my choice to make,\u201d you\u2019re getting stubborn now.</p><p>\n\u201cPlease, my love,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI would never be happy\nknowing I\u2019d condemned you a second time.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Castiel to check me out. It takes quickly, right? Then I\ncan see if it\u2019s worth it. Just for now\u2026indulge me. If all these\nvisions are leading where I think they\u2019re leading, I want something\nof you here still.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou are a hopeless romantic, Miss Hetherington,\u201d his eyes\ntwinkle a little. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t deserve such fierce love. Very well,\nI\u2019ll do what you ask but if there\u2019s the slightest sense of you dying,\nI\u2019ll stop this in its tracks, understand?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNow, where were we, ah yes. Here.\u201d</p><p>\nHe drives hard into you and you swear like a sailor, raking his back\nwhich makes him only pound harder. He\u2019s chasing his release quickly,\nstill keen not to get caught by anyone in the bunker. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI love you, you idiotic hunter,\u201d he breathes before pushing as\nfar as he can go, spilling into you with a coarse grunt. \n</p><p>\nIt\u2019s much the same sensation as last time. There\u2019s a soreness and\npressure in your abdomen that wouldn\u2019t usually happen with sex. You\nfeel a lot hungrier already.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken,\u201d Crowley announces. \u201cI still think you\u2019re a bloody\nlunatic for doing this but I will never deny you what you want, my\nkitten. If this is to be my legacy then for the love of all things\nsacred, do <i>not</i> give them a traditional Scottish name.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell what else goes with MacLeod?\u201d you snort. \u201cOr is the last\nname to be Crowley?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cOh please spare me the indignation of passing my family name\ndown,\u201d he rolls his eyes. \u201cUse your own. It\u2019s much more elegant.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley I-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know, pet, I know. I\u2019m frightened too. Being told by your lover\nthat you\u2019ve got a time limit is not an easy thing to process.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want you unprepared.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d he nods. \u201cI can make preparations now. I assume I\nbite the dust during some prize fight with Lucifer so I hope it looks\ngood at least. Does it happen\u2026.soon?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI think the closer I get the more visions I have.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell\u2026.buggeration then.\u201d</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou rejoined the little hunting party in the bunker after that,\nbeelining straight for Sam and Dean and giving them a hug. They\nreturn it wholeheartedly, squishing you all into a trio of limbs.</p><p>\n\u201cHey, good to see you too, princess,\u201d Dean chuckles. \u201cMiss us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh definitely,\u201d you roll your eyes. \u201cI always love having\nsomebody around to fight me for the last muffin in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCompetition is healthy,\u201d Dean winks.</p><p>\n\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s not, Dean,\u201d Sam sighs. \u201cEverything okay with\nyou? I know you had to face Toni again.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI almost shot her but I\u2019m good,\u201d you step back, trying to see if\nthey were still around. \u201cDo we have company or is it just us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust us but..uh\u2026.mom wants to speak to you,\u201d Sam shifts\nawkwardly.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat happened? Did something go wrong?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNah, nothing like that,\u201d Dean shakes his head. \u201cThink she just\nwants to run something by you. She\u2019s in the library.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll swing by there now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGood, I need to speak to Crowley about the Kelly situation.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a little t\u00eate a t\u00eate then,\u201d Crowley sits down at\nthe table. \u201cPool our resources together because the last thing I\nwant is an heir of Lucifer\u2019s challenging my claim to the throne.\u201d</p><p>\nYou leave them to it, wandering into the library and seeing Mary\nlooking over some gadgets and weapons that you know Mick has provided\nher. You missed having access to stuff like this but it also showed\nyou didn\u2019t need fancy items to get the job done.</p><p>\n\u201cAh good,\u201d she smiles kindly at you. \u201cCome here. I need a girl\nchat.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about boys, are we?\u201d you hesitate.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m woefully inadequate in that area.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell, for a start, you\u2019re dating a demon and not a boy,\u201d she\nlaughs. \u201cBut I get your point. No, this is to do with the Men of\nLetters as a whole.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWere they okay with you? If they hurt you in any way-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she places a hand on your shoulder. \u201cI\njust\u2026.Mick\u2019s a good guy. I think he really does actually wanna make\na go of this alliance.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem with Mick,\u201d you say honestly. \u201cMy\nproblem is with Toni\u2026and sometimes with Ketch depending on whether\nhe\u2019s chasing me or not.\u201d</p><p>\nThere was something about the way Mary\u2019s eyes flashed when you\nmentioned Ketch that you couldn\u2019t help but notice. It was strange,\nalmost like\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cAre you\u2026.<i>involved</i> with Ketch?\u201d you probe.</p><p>\n\u201cHunters,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThey see everything. We may\nhave\u2026.bonded whilst going to fetch my boys. He\u2019s not as scary as\nhis reputation.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know he isn\u2019t but he\u2019s dangerous in other ways,\u201d you say\nfirmly, trying to make her understand. \u201cHe\u2019s never fallen in love\nin the whole time I\u2019ve known him and that\u2019s almost some two decades\nnow.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m not after love, sweetie. Just a connection. For me, it\u2019s only\nbeen about a few weeks since I was with John, remember? Just promise\nme that you won\u2019t tell Sam and Dean, okay? I don\u2019t think they need to\nget protective.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell them. If you really want this alliance\nthen I\u2019ll go along with it but I really can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t shoot\nToni if she gets out of line. There\u2019s something bad coming and it\nmakes her petty jealously look incredibly insignificant in the grand\nscheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHow bad?\u201d Mary\u2019s face falls.</p><p>\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to die and I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019ll be me or\nCrowley,\u201d you confide in her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone that\neither. A secret for a secret.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, I\u2019ll try my damnedest to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\nYou\u2019re becoming part of the family, I mean, hell you\u2019re already a\npart of Dean and Sam\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell if we\u2019re all keeping secrets then yeah, I\u2019m a Winchester,\u201d\nyou laugh.</p><p>\n\u201cSometimes I wish we were a normal family again,\u201d Mary looks off\nwistfully. \u201cI miss those days I used to cook Dean pancakes and read\nto Sam at night. Azazel stole my best years with them.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNow you have a chance to reconnect.\u201d</p><p>\nShe puts her arm around your shoulders, squashing you to her fondly,\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Now, tell me everything about these prophecies you\nhave. I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nFive weeks pass and Lucifer never delivers on his promise to give you\na \u2018show\u2019. In fact, you don\u2019t dream at all in that time.</p><p>\nYou go on hunts with Sam, Dean, Mary and Ketch. Toni is left behind\non your insistence, helping Mick to wrangle the American hunter\nnetwork that you\u2019ve told them about, giving over your contact lists. \n</p><p>\nSurprisingly it works well. The access to the gadgets makes hunting\nso much easier and what would have taken four days takes one. The\ndatabase of lore from the Cambridge headquarters speeds up research\ntime also, although Mick primarily takes charge of that for you.</p><p>\nThe only awkward thing is Mary keeps relying on you to cover for her\nwhilst she sneaks off with Ketch. You feel a little like a high\nschooler, trying to protect a friend from their parents finding out. \n</p><p>\nCrowley keeps visiting often, checking in on how you\u2019re doing and\nbringing you to Hell where he can lie with you some nights. With all\nthe increase in monster activity, you\u2019ve both not be able to get five\nminutes to call Castiel to assess you but as you\u2019re cuddled into\nCrowley\u2019s arms, stark naked under the silk sheets, you get the shock\nof your life when the angel appears at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\n\u201cReally, Feathers, I think you\u2019re starting to enjoy this,\u201d\nCrowley raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou have a habit of dropping in when\nclothing\u2019s been shed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere was no time to send warning. Fabric is immaterial to the\nconversation,\u201d Castiel says in a slightly more animated voice than\nusual. \u201cI have Kelly Kline.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIn your trenchcoat pocket?\u201d Crowley sasses.</p><p>\n\u201cObviously not,\u201d the angel frowns. \u201cIn a safe location. I need\nto speak with Tabitha before I consult Sam and Dean. I feel she would\nbe more receptive to what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Crowley waves his hand. \u201cBut I would\nlike you to do something for her.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m pregnant again,\u201d you take a deep breath. \u201cCrowley wants to\nknow if I\u2019ll survive it.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\u2019ve never seen quite an expression like it on Castiel\u2019s face. It\u2019s\nalmost like a disappointed parent.</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, how is this keeping her safe like our agreement?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe asked me to,\u201d Crowley holds up both hands. \u201cBegged me to,\nin fact. So please, indulge me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy would you choose this?\u201d Castiel seems baffled. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons,\u201d you murmur. \u201cProphet type reasons.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan\u2019t ignore the word of God, can we?\u201d Crowley chips in.</p><p>\n\u201cI frequently have ignored the word of God,\u201d Castiel moves to\nyou. \u201cI\u2019m the 'rebel angel\u2019, remember? God was not what I expected\neither.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes, yes, just assess her you monotonous twit,\u201d Crowley rolls\nhis eyes.</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a funny feeling as Castiel moves his hand over your stomach\nand you see the soft glow of a light underneath his fingers. He\nfurrows his brow, concentrating hard until he steps back.</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re dying this time. When Lucifer was in my\nvessel, he did this and the sensation is different.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo she\u2019ll survive it?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cI believe so, providing nothing kills her beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEver the ray of sunshine,\u201d Crowley sighs before kissing your\nforehead. \u201cWell that\u2019s one blessed relief.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about, Cas?\u201d you ask. \u201cI can\u2019t\nexactly get up right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI have seen naked humans before. I was there at the creation,\u201d\nCastiel says bluntly. \u201cBut I understand your discomfort. Very well,\nmy issue is that I do not want to kill Kelly\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, come again?\u201d Crowley blinks. \u201cA nephilim and you\ndon\u2019t want to smite it?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe?\u201d you\u2019re confused.</p><p>\n\u201cWhen I found Kelly, she had attempted suicide. She was being held\nby Dagon. Evidently Crowley, you are not keeping favour in Hell. The\nPrinces are trying to protect the baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet to the point, Cas,\u201d you interrupt.</p><p>\n\u201cYes, well then. The baby brought Kelly back to life and showed me\na future where peace reigned. I believe this child will help the\nworld. I cannot destroy it. The reason I am telling you, Tabitha, is\nbecause you understand. You believe in Crowley so much you want to\ntry and have his child again even though he is a demon. Do you think\nyour child would be inherently evil?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I would like to believe in nurture versus nature.\nThere are monsters that can reject their nature out there.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThis is my point. Nephilims from any other angel would not be\nconsidered evil but there is an assumption that because it is\nLucifer\u2019s that it will be bad,\u201d Castiel nods. \u201cThis child is not\nbad. This child is good, I can see that. Can you trust my judgement?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Crowley cuts in. \u201cThis is Lucifer\u2019s child. Think\nvery carefully. If you let it live, if Lucifer lives-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt was in one of my visions,\u201d you sigh. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou saw that the child lives?\u201d Castiel asks.</p><p>\n\u201cYes. Lucifer mentioned something about \u2018picking up his kid\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen it has to live. If we try to subvert fate, it could be\ncatastrophic.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut the end result is catastrophic according to her visions. If we\nhave a chance to change the course of destiny then why not?\u201d\nCrowley becomes frustrated. \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate one of the variables\nright now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut if this variable brings peace and balance then that is\nselfish,\u201d Castiel matches his tone. \u201cHow did you feel when God\nkilled <i>your</i> child?\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a streak of colour that goes across your vision and a blur of\nred as you realise Crowley has launched himself at the angel,\ndragging the bedsheets along with him. You manage to whip a pillow in\nfront of you to keep your modesty before rushing to the chair where\nCrowley\u2019s overcoat is, rapidly pulling it onto yourself before you\ntry and intervene.</p><p>\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Crowley roars, fighting with Castiel, completely\nnaked, grabbing him into a headlock. \u201cDo not use my own tragedy for\nyour idiotic arguments! You divine pond scum!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, stop it!\u201d you yell, trying to pull him off but Crowley\nwas infinitely stronger than you were.</p><p>\n\u201cI ought to rip you apart!\u201d Crowley continues shouting whilst\nCastiel struggles out of his grip.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to save humanity!\u201d Castiel chokes out.</p><p>\n\u201cDo so on your own dime, you insensitive wretch!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSTOP FIGHTING!\u201d you get in the middle of them. \u201cCas made a\nmistake, okay. It was a poor choice of words.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky she\u2019s here,\u201d Crowley snarls, pointing at Castiel.</p><p>\n\u201cGo get some scotch and calm down,\u201d you send him out.</p><p>\nCrowley glares before snapping some clothes on himself and stalking\nout. You take a deep breath before turning to the angel who was\nprofoundly ruffled.</p><p>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking of him,\u201d you straighten out\nhis tie. \u201cMy visions have been leading me to the conclusion that if\nthings play out then Crowley dies and I might have to go with\nLucifer.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAh. Forgive me, I did not know.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you\u2019re asking him to choose between the child\u2019s death or his\ndeath and my possible enslavement. He\u2019s not going to readily agree.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan I show you? I just need someone to understand me,\u201d he holds\nout two fingers hesitantly.</p><p>\n\u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><p>\nIt\u2019s hard to describe the scene you see. It\u2019s overwhelming in a way.\nYou just know an innate sense of peace, of relaxation. It\u2019s like\nyou\u2019re standing on top of a mountain watching the sun rise. It\u2019s\njust\u2026hopeful. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThis is the vision the child gave to me. That is his intentions.\nHe only wants to help. He\u2026uh\u2026.wants me to mentor him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe wants you to be his dad instead?\u201d you blink as the room comes\nback into focus. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIn a sense,\u201d Castiel nods. \u201cBut that is what I want to fight\nfor.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan he keep me and Crowley safe?\u201d you ask.</p><p>\n\u201cIf he senses no ill will from you then yes he will because I will\ntell him you are good people\u2026well, <i>you</i> are a good person.\nYour child will no doubt be a good person.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf this is the gamble we have to take to bring everlasting\npeace\u2026.I suppose I\u2019ve nearly died for less,\u201d you take a breath.</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the angel grabs your shoulders, looking at you\nintensely. \u201cI knew you would understand me. You are my greatest\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to butter me up, you know. I already agreed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou agreed?\u201d comes Crowley\u2019s voice as he returns with a large\nbottle of Craig he\u2019s drinking directly from. \u201cI could swear you\u2019ve\nlost your marbles lately, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThis nephilim can keep us safe,\u201d you reiterate. \u201cHonestly,\nthis is the most hopeful I\u2019ve been since I started having these\nstupid prophecies.\u201d</p><p>\nCrowley\u2019s face falls a little at that. He knows he can\u2019t argue.\nAnything to cling onto was better than blind faith that the world\nwould right itself.</p><p>\n\u201cFeathers, leave us,\u201d Crowley dismisses Castiel with a wave. \u201cI\nneed to talk to her alone.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cVery well. I will update Tabitha on how Kelly is progressing and\nkeep an eye on her own pregnancy also.\u201d</p><p>\nThen he vanishes.</p><p>\nCrowley just stands there, one hand massaging his temple. He looks\nweary, older. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIs this really all we have to look forward to?\u201d he mutters. \u201cI\ndie and you become Lucifer\u2019s plaything?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat choice do we have? You know how fighting destiny goes. It\u2019s\nonly subvertable at the last second with the Winchesters involved.\u201d</p><p>\nCrowley snorts inelegantly, \u201cFair point, well made. Well\u2026.at\nleast there is one glimmer of hope now. If you believe this child can\nhelp, I trust you. At least mine will not kill you. I can take great\nstock that my legacy will live on.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he comes over to you, kissing you so messily\nyou can taste the alcohol. \u201cAnything as long as it\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI love you. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, I don\u2019t think there was a grand enough gesture like\nsuicidally getting me to knock you up just so you could keep\nsomething of me around,\u201d he smirks. \u201cMakes a demon feel wanted.\nNow, I must insist that if I am to get the rest of this pent up\nenergy out that I thoroughly fuck you right here and now in my coat\nbecause it looks simply criminal on you.\u201d</p><p>\nThe next thing you know you\u2019re being thrown on the bed.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n\u201cOh Tabbbbbyyyyyy,\u201d comes that voice.</p><p>\n\u201cGo away,\u201d you hiss.</p><p>\n\u201cAww come on, sweetcheeks. I gave you a few weeks reprieve. Wasn\u2019t\nthat kind of me?\u201d Lucifer pouts. \u201cI hear we\u2019re getting to the\nendgame. These demons looooove to gossip. You\u2019ve been having visions\nabout me, haven\u2019t you? Visions where you come to me of your own free\nwill?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGO AWAY!\u201d you say more strongly.</p><p>\n\u201cNuh uh,\u201d he wags a finger. \u201cSee, I remember your reaction when\nI projected that little image into your nugget. You weren\u2019t exactly\nhorrified. I didn\u2019t ruin your fun with Crowley. That says to me that\non some level, you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust stop hounding me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t deny yourself what you want,\u201d he\u2019s approaching you. \u201cYou\nwant me. I know you do. You\u2019re just scared of hurting Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d</p><p>\nThen the world dissolves into that room. You\u2019re by a large bay\nwindow, the doors open wide as the summer breeze tickles at your\nskin. You can feel the heat, magnified through the glass, bathing you\nas you look out at the view.</p><p>\n\u201cMy love,\u201d Lucifer says from behind you.</p><p>\nYou turn to see him, shirtless, his wings in a relaxed position. He\u2019s\njust bathing in the flow of the sun like you are.</p><p>\nYou can\u2019t control your actions as you move towards him, placing a\nhand on his chest and snaking it up to his neck. You usually have a\nmodicum of control in these kind of dreams but it\u2019s like you\u2019re\nviewing a movie through your own perspective.</p><p>\n\u201cYou have no idea how happy you made me when you chose to come with\nme,\u201d Lucifer murmurs softly.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit, at first I thought you were just obsessed. Like a\nteenage crush or something,\u201d you hear your own voice say.</p><p>\n\u201cNo, Tabitha. It\u2019s love,\u201d he pushes your hair back behind your\near. \u201cIt\u2019s a bond, it\u2019s unity. You are mine and I am yours.\u201d</p><p>\nYour hand drags up to the bridge of his wing before tracing gently\nthrough the feathers. He sighs contentedly, pulling you closer.</p><p>\n\u201cI will never let you go,\u201d he leans down, capturing your lips in\na kiss.</p><p>\nSurely dreams should not be this tactile? Surely you should not be\nable to feel the warmth of his breath, the caress of his fingers, the\nchill of his skin? You also caught a waft of scent now and then as\nhis wings rippled, the smell of a warm summer\u2019s evening.</p><p>\nWas this a dream? Was it <i>just</i> a dream? Could this be\u2026a prophecy?\nWas this what was to come after the grey world?</p><p>\nYou found your emotions getting more and more tangled as Lucifer\ndeepened the kiss and you remembered the last time you\u2019d done this,\nwhen you\u2019d done this willingly. It was confusing knowing how serene\nand almost gentleman-like he could be contrasted with his vicious and\nspiteful side. \n</p><p>\nThen it was like you\u2019d blinked because one second you were upright\nand kissing him and the next you were on the bed. Lucifer was naked\nabove you and you had no clothes on either. You might have been\nchilled to the bone with Lucifer\u2019s temperature but somehow the baking\nsunlight coming through the windows was keeping you warm.</p><p>\n\u201cIt will be my honour to claim you as mine,\u201d Lucifer smiles\nlopsidedly. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThen do it,\u201d your voice is full of lust.</p><p>\n\u201cAfter I properly revere you.\u201d</p><p>\nHe wanted to explore every inch of you, mouthing at you, kissing you,\nbiting you. You felt relaxed, you felt peaceful as his mouth hovered\nin between your legs.</p><p>\n\u201cI never got to taste such a pure creature last time,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>\nThen the scene flips again and there\u2019s this almost heavy feeling in\nyour legs like you get after an orgasm. Lucifer\u2019s fully on top of\nyou, cock ready and waiting as he searches your face for permission.</p><p>\n\u201cSay yes to me, Tabitha. Say yes to being mine and I swear I will\nkeep you safe for eternity. You will be mine, you\u2019ll bear my family,\nyou\u2019ll fight alongside me against our enemies. Say yes.\u201d</p><p>\nHe kisses you hard and you can feel him press his cock to your\nentrance, holding himself back with great difficulty.</p><p>\n\u201cSay yes to me.\u201d</p><p>\nTo your horror, the next words you say are, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\nThe next sensation you feel is being full, so full you\u2019re being\nstretched as he eases into you. How can you feel that with such\nperfect detail?!</p><p>\n\u201cYou make me so happy,\u201d he murmurs before fully driving himself\nin to the hilt.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou awake with a start, flailing as though the spectre of the Dream\nLucifer could be pushed off you. You\u2019re mortified to realise there\u2019s\na dull throbbing ache between your legs, that you got aroused by what\nyou had seen. \n</p><p>\nYou\u2019re just lucky Crowley wasn\u2019t next to you because you know he\nwould\u2019ve heard your panicked thoughts just now. He didn\u2019t need to\nknow how much you were being tormented by this.</p><p><i>Did\nyou enjoy that? Oh you did, you bad baaaaad girl. Come see what\u2019s\nkickin\u2019 in the throne room, Tabby. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it.</i></p><p>\nYou hastily scramble, pulling on jeans and a t-shirt before rushing\nout to the throne room, past several demons who give excited\nwhispers. You throw open the double doors to see Crowley on the floor\nand Lucifer on the throne, one leg crooked over the arm rest.</p><p>\n\u201cHi cupcake,\u201d he smiles sweetly at you. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, get out!\u201d Crowley roars through his pain.</p><p>\nLucifer flicks his wrist and you hear an audible crack as Crowley\u2019s\nback seems to bend unnaturally far backwards.</p><p>\n\u201cStop it!\u201d you yell, running forward to grab him, to protect him.</p><p>\n\u201cHmmm, nah,\u201d Lucifer shrugs. \u201cHe was mean to me. I don\u2019t like\nmean people. Hey, here\u2019s a neat idea. I\u2019ll tell you something that\nCrowley did that\u2019ll mean you don\u2019t like him any more.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf it\u2019s about my parents, I already know,\u201d you fire back.</p><p>\nLucifer gives a moody pout before drumming his fingers on the arm\nrests of the throne, \u201cCrowley, you\u2019re no fun. I expected you to be\nmore of a coward.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBite me,\u201d Crowley growls back, gritting his teeth through the\npain.</p><p>\n\u201cYou know, I might, so don\u2019t test me,\u201d Lucifer snarls. \u201cFineeee,\nhow about this then, Crowley? I\u2019ve been sending sex dreams to Tabitha\nfor weeks now and she just <i>loves</i> them, don\u2019t you baby?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf by love you mean I want to claw my own brain out after them\nthen yeah,\u201d you hiss. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Why not\nshack up with Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cKelly was sweet and all but she had no fire,\u201d Lucifer muses.\n\u201cYou, on the other hand, you\u2019re the only human female in creation\nthat\u2019s told me no. You\u2019re the only one who ever tried to understand\nme. You are the human I\u2019m meant to have so if Crowley could just\u2026I\ndon\u2019t know\u2026die? Gee, that would be swell.\u201d</p><p>\nAnother crack as Crowley\u2019s arm snaps in two and you\u2019re trying to hold\nhim as he falls sideways.</p><p>\n\u201cCas!\u201d you shout.</p><p>\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Lucifer leans forward. \u201cMy little\nbro ain\u2019t gonna help this. I\u2019ll find you. I always will. I hope\nyou\u2019re good at being a stepmom by the way.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a flap of wings behind you before you\u2019re deposited in the\nbunker, screaming your lungs out for the boys. There\u2019s a crash as\ndoors open and the running of footsteps before Sam, Dean and Mary\nburst into your bedroom. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?!\u201d Dean says in alarm, taking in\nCrowley\u2019s near unconscious state. \n</p><p>\n\u201cLucifer,\u201d Castiel says for you. \u201cAppears he came for the\nthrone of Hell. He\u2019s in his old vessel.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Dean mutters. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cPeachy,\u201d Crowley groans. \n</p><p>\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to go after Kelly,\u201d you tell Castiel. \u201cHe kept\nsaying he wants me to be a stepmum to the kid. Go make sure she\u2019s\nfine.\u201d</p><p>\nThe angel disappears.</p><p>\n\u201cTell us what the hell is going on, Tabitha,\u201d Sam kneels down,\nhelping you bring Crowley onto the bed.</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley found Lucifer\u2019s essence and stuffed it into a vessel that\nwas bound with bits of the cage,\u201d you rattle off. \u201cSomehow he\nbroke out of the control. He was meant to be contained until we could\nget Kelly\u2019s kid but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHow long have you known this?\u201d Dean asks suspiciously.</p><p>\n\u201cLike a month,\u201d you meet his gaze defiantly.</p><p>\n\u201cTabs, we said no more secrets,\u201d Dean sighs long and hard.\n\u201cSweetheart, you need to start trusting us more. We could\u2019ve\nhelped.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTrust me, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d you stand up. \u201cHe would\u2019ve said\nanything to you to rile you up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo we need to go get to Kelly,\u201d Mary cuts in. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m\ntaking from this. Correct?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes, we need to move now. I assume Cas has told you about his\nplans?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah but we still think he\u2019s nuts for it,\u201d Sam adds. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI am perfectly stable,\u201d Castiel says as he reappears. \u201cKelly\nsays\u2026uh\u2026well she shouted that her water has broken. I need\nassistance.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTake us all,\u201d you say firmly. \u201cI think this is going to be the\nlast stand off soon.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere without us,\u201d Toni says from the\ndoorway, flanked by Mick.</p><p>\n\u201cDo you live here now?!\u201d you hiss.</p><p>\n\u201cTrust me, I wouldn\u2019t choose to live somewhere this odious,\u201d she\ncurls her lip. \u201cBut you\u2019re not letting a nephilim be born. It\u2019s\nagainst the code.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, Tabitha,\u201d Mick nods. \u201cIt\u2019s too powerful.\u201d</p><p>\nToni holds up a gun whilst Mick uses a knife to slice open his palm,\ndrawing the angel banishing sigil on the wall.</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, you Brit dickbags!\u201d Dean yells.</p><p>\n\u201cOnly way, mate,\u201d Mick shrugs apologetically.</p><p>\nBefore he can slam his hand on it, there\u2019s two gunshots and blood\nexplodes from their faces. They drop to the floor, bodies thudding\nheavily to reveal Ketch standing behind them.</p><p>\n\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d you shout. \u201cArthur?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTheir termination orders had come through,\u201d he says quaintly,\nimperceptibly nodding at Mary.</p><p>\nYou knew that was bollocks. More likely he\u2019d done it before he was\nafraid for Mary\u2019s safety but it still shocked you. You looked away\nfrom the bodies on the floor, trying not to process it.</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Castiel says, healing Crowley before gathering\neveryone in a circle once they had tooled up.</p><p>\n\u201cGo Team Free Will,\u201d Dean says grimly. \u201cEnd of days part sixty\nfive.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEveryone ready?\u201d Sam asks.</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\u201d you murmur quietly. \u201cBut let\u2019s do this anyway.\u201d</p><p>\nYou give one last scared look to Crowley who returns it before you\nvanish out of the bunker.</p><p>_____\u00a0</p><p>Taglist:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <strike>@wolfygecko</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_LK6GlOtQQcl2UWq0WM-g\">@fairytale07</a></p></p>",

Angst</i></p><p><b>Chapter 47 - Overruled</b></p><p><i>(Proof reading errors likely)</i></p><p><i>A/N: This is a long ass chapter guys, Strap in.</i></p><p>________</p><p>\n\u201cOh Crowleyyyyy,\u201d Lucifer had cooed to him telepathically as Crowley fucked you hard on the throne. \u201cLet\u2019s have a private chat,\ndevil to demon.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet stuffed,\u201d Crowley thought back. \u201cBusy here.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna listen because I know you still haven\u2019t told her\nabout her parents yet,\u201d comes the derisive response. \u201cThis will\nbe the last time you touch her. Let me out of the bonds of this\nvessel and I\u2019ll spare your miserable existence. Don\u2019t and I\u2019ll sing\nlike a canary.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Crowley mentally shrugs. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>\nHe watches Lucifer bluster for a split second before an expression of\nrage comes over his face and then he focuses his attention back to\nyou.</p><p>\nCrowley knew he was trying to converse with you in a similar manner.\nHe couldn\u2019t read your thoughts any more because of it. He just hoped you\u2019d be\nstrong enough to resist his charms this time. \n</p>[[MORE]]<p>\nHe uses his essence to help your orgasm along, trying to rip you out\nof the internal conversation and he grunts as he feels you clench and\npulse around him. Then he can hear your thoughts again.</p><p>\n\u201c<i>He\u2019s never going to stop</i>,\u201d you kept thinking over and over.\n\u201c<i>He\u2019ll never stop until he has me.</i>\u201d</p><p>\nOf all the things in creation that you\u2019d fought, Crowley knew\nLucifer\u2019s obsession with you scared you the most. Not even a display\nlike this had been a big enough clue for the idiot feather duster that you didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>\nThen he found his own release, his cock twitching inside you. You\nalways felt marvellous around him. So tight, so willing.</p><p>\nThen Crowley\u2019s mouth gets the better of him and he\u2019s in a war of\nwords with Lucifer, causing the archangel to bristle. That seemed to\nmake you stiffen to an unnatural degree before Crowley leaned around\nand saw your eyes glaze over. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIf it saves the world Dean, what choice do I have? I\u2019ll go with\nhim,\u201d you say dully.</p><p>\n\u201cI wonder if she\u2019s talking about little old me,\u201d Lucifer grins\ncheekily, looking at Crowley out of the tops of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like\nto think she\u2019d come round to my way of thinking eventually.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to run. Don\u2019t make me,\u201d you start picking up speed\nin your babbling and Crowley knew he needed to get you out before\nLucifer took this as a sign of victory.</p><p>\nHe appeared with you in the bedroom, quite beside himself with worry\nas he held you close, listening to horrible things that you were\npredicting. They were things that told him there was a choice to\nmake, a choice to save humanity but it was likely that either meant\nyou went with Lucifer or Crowley died. Neither of those were\nappealing. Neither of those he could bear to listen to as you sounded\nlike you were imitating a sobbing voice, <i>your</i> voice from the\nfuture.</p><p><i>Well\u2026.bloody\nhell.</i></p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\nAfter your phone conversation with Dean, Crowley seems to be looking\nat you intensely. \n</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, there\u2019s something I need to tell you,\u201d Crowley starts.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d you automatically say, feeling your\nstomach flip. \u201cYou never use that voice unless you messed up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I found out very very recently,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI\njust needed to confirm if it was true or not.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, this might change things between us.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in this for the long game now,\u201d you laugh a\nlittle bitterly. \u201cSo just get it over with. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Crowley blinks. \u201cWho is who?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh,\u201d your eyes widen. \u201cOkay, you didn\u2019t stray then, that\u2019s\nsomething.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy on earth would I do that, you certifiable woman?\u201d Crowley is\nbewildered. \u201cWhy would that even enter your mind?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSomething Lucifer said to me just now,\u201d you bite your lip,\nlooking at the sheets.</p><p>\n\u201cIs he speaking to you telepathically?\u201d Crowley becomes very\nangry. \u201cAbominable git! Pet, you are the top of the chain and why\nwould I try and find anything as good as that when there isn\u2019t? No I\nhaven\u2019t betrayed you. This is to do with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI mean your <i>real</i> parents,\u201d Crowley sighs again. \u201cBefore\nyou and Alistair were adopted.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou mean\u2026.did you\u2026.did you kill them or something?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cYour mother, she made a deal,\u201d Crowley tells you. \u201cShe\ncouldn\u2019t have children, see. She asked for ten years of fertility so\nI gave them to her. That\u2019s how you and your brother came to be. When\nit was time to collect\u2026.there were more casualties than was\nexpected. It was the Marchioness disaster.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you had a hand in my birth?\u201d you try and wrap\nyour head around it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s creepy or fate at\nthis point.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou know, I was expecting rather more shouting than is currently\nhappening,\u201d Crowley surveys you.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know,\u201d you shrug. \u201cI never knew my birth parents.\nIt would be unfair of me to get angry over something like this. You\ndidn\u2019t know I would be the product of it. I can\u2019t hate you for a\ndecision my mother made.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\u2019d never seen the King of Hell relax as much as he did. Crowley\nalmost fell back into the sheets with relief.</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, I love you. You are just the most exquisite example of\nmortal divinity.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to suggest they\u2019ll make me a saint again after I\ndie, I\u2019ll throw this pillow at you,\u201d you scowl. \u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s\nangel. I just fucked a demon in front of the devil.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat you did,\u201d Crowley purrs, running a hand along your waist.\n\u201cVery bold and very brave. I know he was trying to speak to you\nmost of the time. Is he saying anything now?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOnly the usual,\u201d you mutter. \u201cThat he\u2019ll kill you, he\u2019ll kill\nthe Winchesters and I\u2019ll be some queen of the dawn or other.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNot if I kill him first,\u201d Crowley grumbles. \u201cI\u2019ll pluck him\nand roast him like a Christmas turkey.\u201d</p><p>\nYou wince, hearing that saccharin voice of Lucifer\u2019s invading your\nhead again.</p><p><i>Tabbbbbbyyyyyyyyy,\noh my little cutesy wutesy little kitty cat? Answer me baby. Did you\nlike my show for you? I promise you, tonight\u2019s will be even better.</i></p><p>\n\u201cHe won\u2019t shut up,\u201d you hiss, clenching your hands over your\nears. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going mad.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of Hell. Distance will help,\u201d Crowley frowns,\nredressing you with a snap of his fingers and then vanishing with you\nback into the bunker.</p><p>\nImmediately the archangel\u2019s voice dims to where you can\u2019t even make\nout individual words. The relief was immense.</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you say earnestly. \u201cBeing a prophet sucks balls.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSuch an interesting turn of phrase,\u201d Crowley chuckles. \u201cAnd\nyes, I\u2019ll never forgive God for pulling that little stunt.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a flash where you see Crowley in the grey world, screaming in\nagony before it\u2019s gone just as suddenly as it started. The more you\nkeep seeing, the more you\u2019re certain you\u2019re going to lose him. You\njust want to shirk all your hunter responsibilities, spend as much\ntime with Crowley as you can. Then a mad idea comes to you.</p><p>\n\u201cTake me again,\u201d you nip at his neck.</p><p>\n\u201cAlready? Darling, \u00a0I\u2019m not a machine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not up to it?\u201d you tease. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI may not be a machine but I <i>am</i> Crowley and I am always up for\nravishing you. What\u2019s brought this mood on?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI just need you again.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a click and you\u2019re disrobed before you practically pounce on\nhim. He seems shocked at first but he play fights with you, pinning\nyou to the bed with his demonic essence.</p><p>\n\u201cWicked girl,\u201d he smirks. \u201cAnd all mine.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, just fuck me,\u201d you beg.</p><p>\n\u201cHow can I refuse such a pretty request like that?\u201d \n</p><p>\nYou\u2019re still slick from the sex you had earlier and he has no trouble\ngliding his cock into you, stretching you out around him. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBut let\u2019s aim for a quickie,\u201d he whispers in your ear. \u201cI\u2019m\nfairly certain there\u2019s the Winchester brood not so far away and your\nold colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen come on,\u201d you grab his hips, urging him to roll forward.</p><p>\n\u201cVery <i>very</i> eager,\u201d he purrs. \u201cMy my.\u201d</p><p>\nHe covers your mouth with his hand before taking an almost feral\npace. He\u2019s driving himself home, desperately trying to keep his own\nsounds to small groans and curse words in a language you don\u2019t\nunderstand. \n</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s take the quick method for you, my love,\u201d he rasps and you\ncan see the tendrils of his power snake across your body, feeling\nlike hands were pawing at every inch of you. \u201cCome now, I want to\nfeel you shake in my arms.\u201d</p><p>\nHe mouths at your neck, leaving tiny bites in his wake until you\njerk, your orgasm barrelling across you as you half scream into his\npalm. \n</p><p>\n\u201cOh I do love those noises you make, kitten,\u201d he groans. \u201cI\nshan\u2019t be far behind.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, do what you did when Lucifer was riding shotgun,\u201d you\nsay seriously. \u201cSwitch off the thing that makes you infertile.\u201d</p><p>\nHe stops dead, looking horrified, \u201cAbsolutely not! Are you bloody\nmad?! I almost killed you the last time!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnd Chuck said I wouldn\u2019t have survived <i>that</i> time but didn\u2019t say I\nwould <i>never</i> survive it,\u201d you argue. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy are you so insistent, darling?\u201d he looks grave. \n</p><p>\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll lose you soon and I\u2019m trying to cling on\nin any way I can,\u201d you admit.</p><p>\n\u201cOh you silly silly girl,\u201d he kisses all over your face. \u201cIf I\ndie, I wouldn\u2019t want you tethered to me in such a way. I\u2019d want you\nto move on.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to, I want this,\u201d you protest. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIf this is just to be more certain of us rather than you and\nLucifer, Tabitha, do not risk your life. I would infinitely prefer\nyou to go to the Devil for comfort than be ripped apart by my child.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThat\u2019s my choice to make,\u201d you\u2019re getting stubborn now.</p><p>\n\u201cPlease, my love,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI would never be happy\nknowing I\u2019d condemned you a second time.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Castiel to check me out. It takes quickly, right? Then I\ncan see if it\u2019s worth it. Just for now\u2026indulge me. If all these\nvisions are leading where I think they\u2019re leading, I want something\nof you here still.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou are a hopeless romantic, Miss Hetherington,\u201d his eyes\ntwinkle a little. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t deserve such fierce love. Very well,\nI\u2019ll do what you ask but if there\u2019s the slightest sense of you dying,\nI\u2019ll stop this in its tracks, understand?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNow, where were we, ah yes. Here.\u201d</p><p>\nHe drives hard into you and you swear like a sailor, raking his back\nwhich makes him only pound harder. He\u2019s chasing his release quickly,\nstill keen not to get caught by anyone in the bunker. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI love you, you idiotic hunter,\u201d he breathes before pushing as\nfar as he can go, spilling into you with a coarse grunt. \n</p><p>\nIt\u2019s much the same sensation as last time. There\u2019s a soreness and\npressure in your abdomen that wouldn\u2019t usually happen with sex. You\nfeel a lot hungrier already.</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken,\u201d Crowley announces. \u201cI still think you\u2019re a bloody\nlunatic for doing this but I will never deny you what you want, my\nkitten. If this is to be my legacy then for the love of all things\nsacred, do <i>not</i> give them a traditional Scottish name.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell what else goes with MacLeod?\u201d you snort. \u201cOr is the last\nname to be Crowley?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cOh please spare me the indignation of passing my family name\ndown,\u201d he rolls his eyes. \u201cUse your own. It\u2019s much more elegant.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley I-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know, pet, I know. I\u2019m frightened too. Being told by your lover\nthat you\u2019ve got a time limit is not an easy thing to process.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want you unprepared.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d he nods. \u201cI can make preparations now. I assume I\nbite the dust during some prize fight with Lucifer so I hope it looks\ngood at least. Does it happen\u2026.soon?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI think the closer I get the more visions I have.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell\u2026.buggeration then.\u201d</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou rejoined the little hunting party in the bunker after that,\nbeelining straight for Sam and Dean and giving them a hug. They\nreturn it wholeheartedly, squishing you all into a trio of limbs.</p><p>\n\u201cHey, good to see you too, princess,\u201d Dean chuckles. \u201cMiss us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh definitely,\u201d you roll your eyes. \u201cI always love having\nsomebody around to fight me for the last muffin in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCompetition is healthy,\u201d Dean winks.</p><p>\n\u201cPretty sure it\u2019s not, Dean,\u201d Sam sighs. \u201cEverything okay with\nyou? I know you had to face Toni again.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI almost shot her but I\u2019m good,\u201d you step back, trying to see if\nthey were still around. \u201cDo we have company or is it just us?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust us but..uh\u2026.mom wants to speak to you,\u201d Sam shifts\nawkwardly.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat happened? Did something go wrong?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNah, nothing like that,\u201d Dean shakes his head. \u201cThink she just\nwants to run something by you. She\u2019s in the library.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll swing by there now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGood, I need to speak to Crowley about the Kelly situation.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a little t\u00eate a t\u00eate then,\u201d Crowley sits down at\nthe table. \u201cPool our resources together because the last thing I\nwant is an heir of Lucifer\u2019s challenging my claim to the throne.\u201d</p><p>\nYou leave them to it, wandering into the library and seeing Mary\nlooking over some gadgets and weapons that you know Mick has provided\nher. You missed having access to stuff like this but it also showed\nyou didn\u2019t need fancy items to get the job done.</p><p>\n\u201cAh good,\u201d she smiles kindly at you. \u201cCome here. I need a girl\nchat.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about boys, are we?\u201d you hesitate.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m woefully inadequate in that area.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell, for a start, you\u2019re dating a demon and not a boy,\u201d she\nlaughs. \u201cBut I get your point. No, this is to do with the Men of\nLetters as a whole.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWere they okay with you? If they hurt you in any way-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she places a hand on your shoulder. \u201cI\njust\u2026.Mick\u2019s a good guy. I think he really does actually wanna make\na go of this alliance.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem with Mick,\u201d you say honestly. \u201cMy\nproblem is with Toni\u2026and sometimes with Ketch depending on whether\nhe\u2019s chasing me or not.\u201d</p><p>\nThere was something about the way Mary\u2019s eyes flashed when you\nmentioned Ketch that you couldn\u2019t help but notice. It was strange,\nalmost like\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cAre you\u2026.<i>involved</i> with Ketch?\u201d you probe.</p><p>\n\u201cHunters,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThey see everything. We may\nhave\u2026.bonded whilst going to fetch my boys. He\u2019s not as scary as\nhis reputation.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI know he isn\u2019t but he\u2019s dangerous in other ways,\u201d you say\nfirmly, trying to make her understand. \u201cHe\u2019s never fallen in love\nin the whole time I\u2019ve known him and that\u2019s almost some two decades\nnow.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m not after love, sweetie. Just a connection. For me, it\u2019s only\nbeen about a few weeks since I was with John, remember? Just promise\nme that you won\u2019t tell Sam and Dean, okay? I don\u2019t think they need to\nget protective.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell them. If you really want this alliance\nthen I\u2019ll go along with it but I really can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t shoot\nToni if she gets out of line. There\u2019s something bad coming and it\nmakes her petty jealously look incredibly insignificant in the grand\nscheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHow bad?\u201d Mary\u2019s face falls.</p><p>\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to die and I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019ll be me or\nCrowley,\u201d you confide in her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone that\neither. A secret for a secret.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, I\u2019ll try my damnedest to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\nYou\u2019re becoming part of the family, I mean, hell you\u2019re already a\npart of Dean and Sam\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell if we\u2019re all keeping secrets then yeah, I\u2019m a Winchester,\u201d\nyou laugh.</p><p>\n\u201cSometimes I wish we were a normal family again,\u201d Mary looks off\nwistfully. \u201cI miss those days I used to cook Dean pancakes and read\nto Sam at night. Azazel stole my best years with them.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNow you have a chance to reconnect.\u201d</p><p>\nShe puts her arm around your shoulders, squashing you to her fondly,\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Now, tell me everything about these prophecies you\nhave. I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nFive weeks pass and Lucifer never delivers on his promise to give you\na \u2018show\u2019. In fact, you don\u2019t dream at all in that time.</p><p>\nYou go on hunts with Sam, Dean, Mary and Ketch. Toni is left behind\non your insistence, helping Mick to wrangle the American hunter\nnetwork that you\u2019ve told them about, giving over your contact lists. \n</p><p>\nSurprisingly it works well. The access to the gadgets makes hunting\nso much easier and what would have taken four days takes one. The\ndatabase of lore from the Cambridge headquarters speeds up research\ntime also, although Mick primarily takes charge of that for you.</p><p>\nThe only awkward thing is Mary keeps relying on you to cover for her\nwhilst she sneaks off with Ketch. You feel a little like a high\nschooler, trying to protect a friend from their parents finding out. \n</p><p>\nCrowley keeps visiting often, checking in on how you\u2019re doing and\nbringing you to Hell where he can lie with you some nights. With all\nthe increase in monster activity, you\u2019ve both not be able to get five\nminutes to call Castiel to assess you but as you\u2019re cuddled into\nCrowley\u2019s arms, stark naked under the silk sheets, you get the shock\nof your life when the angel appears at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\n\u201cReally, Feathers, I think you\u2019re starting to enjoy this,\u201d\nCrowley raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou have a habit of dropping in when\nclothing\u2019s been shed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThere was no time to send warning. Fabric is immaterial to the\nconversation,\u201d Castiel says in a slightly more animated voice than\nusual. \u201cI have Kelly Kline.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIn your trenchcoat pocket?\u201d Crowley sasses.</p><p>\n\u201cObviously not,\u201d the angel frowns. \u201cIn a safe location. I need\nto speak with Tabitha before I consult Sam and Dean. I feel she would\nbe more receptive to what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Crowley waves his hand. \u201cBut I would\nlike you to do something for her.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m pregnant again,\u201d you take a deep breath. \u201cCrowley wants to\nknow if I\u2019ll survive it.\u201d</p><p>\nYou\u2019ve never seen quite an expression like it on Castiel\u2019s face. It\u2019s\nalmost like a disappointed parent.</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, how is this keeping her safe like our agreement?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe asked me to,\u201d Crowley holds up both hands. \u201cBegged me to,\nin fact. So please, indulge me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhy would you choose this?\u201d Castiel seems baffled. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons,\u201d you murmur. \u201cProphet type reasons.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan\u2019t ignore the word of God, can we?\u201d Crowley chips in.</p><p>\n\u201cI frequently have ignored the word of God,\u201d Castiel moves to\nyou. \u201cI\u2019m the 'rebel angel\u2019, remember? God was not what I expected\neither.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes, yes, just assess her you monotonous twit,\u201d Crowley rolls\nhis eyes.</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a funny feeling as Castiel moves his hand over your stomach\nand you see the soft glow of a light underneath his fingers. He\nfurrows his brow, concentrating hard until he steps back.</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re dying this time. When Lucifer was in my\nvessel, he did this and the sensation is different.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo she\u2019ll survive it?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cI believe so, providing nothing kills her beforehand.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEver the ray of sunshine,\u201d Crowley sighs before kissing your\nforehead. \u201cWell that\u2019s one blessed relief.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about, Cas?\u201d you ask. \u201cI can\u2019t\nexactly get up right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI have seen naked humans before. I was there at the creation,\u201d\nCastiel says bluntly. \u201cBut I understand your discomfort. Very well,\nmy issue is that I do not want to kill Kelly\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, come again?\u201d Crowley blinks. \u201cA nephilim and you\ndon\u2019t want to smite it?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe?\u201d you\u2019re confused.</p><p>\n\u201cWhen I found Kelly, she had attempted suicide. She was being held\nby Dagon. Evidently Crowley, you are not keeping favour in Hell. The\nPrinces are trying to protect the baby.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGet to the point, Cas,\u201d you interrupt.</p><p>\n\u201cYes, well then. The baby brought Kelly back to life and showed me\na future where peace reigned. I believe this child will help the\nworld. I cannot destroy it. The reason I am telling you, Tabitha, is\nbecause you understand. You believe in Crowley so much you want to\ntry and have his child again even though he is a demon. Do you think\nyour child would be inherently evil?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I would like to believe in nurture versus nature.\nThere are monsters that can reject their nature out there.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThis is my point. Nephilims from any other angel would not be\nconsidered evil but there is an assumption that because it is\nLucifer\u2019s that it will be bad,\u201d Castiel nods. \u201cThis child is not\nbad. This child is good, I can see that. Can you trust my judgement?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Crowley cuts in. \u201cThis is Lucifer\u2019s child. Think\nvery carefully. If you let it live, if Lucifer lives-\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt was in one of my visions,\u201d you sigh. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou saw that the child lives?\u201d Castiel asks.</p><p>\n\u201cYes. Lucifer mentioned something about \u2018picking up his kid\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThen it has to live. If we try to subvert fate, it could be\ncatastrophic.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut the end result is catastrophic according to her visions. If we\nhave a chance to change the course of destiny then why not?\u201d\nCrowley becomes frustrated. \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate one of the variables\nright now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut if this variable brings peace and balance then that is\nselfish,\u201d Castiel matches his tone. \u201cHow did you feel when God\nkilled <i>your</i> child?\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a streak of colour that goes across your vision and a blur of\nred as you realise Crowley has launched himself at the angel,\ndragging the bedsheets along with him. You manage to whip a pillow in\nfront of you to keep your modesty before rushing to the chair where\nCrowley\u2019s overcoat is, rapidly pulling it onto yourself before you\ntry and intervene.</p><p>\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Crowley roars, fighting with Castiel, completely\nnaked, grabbing him into a headlock. \u201cDo not use my own tragedy for\nyour idiotic arguments! You divine pond scum!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley, stop it!\u201d you yell, trying to pull him off but Crowley\nwas infinitely stronger than you were.</p><p>\n\u201cI ought to rip you apart!\u201d Crowley continues shouting whilst\nCastiel struggles out of his grip.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to save humanity!\u201d Castiel chokes out.</p><p>\n\u201cDo so on your own dime, you insensitive wretch!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSTOP FIGHTING!\u201d you get in the middle of them. \u201cCas made a\nmistake, okay. It was a poor choice of words.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky she\u2019s here,\u201d Crowley snarls, pointing at Castiel.</p><p>\n\u201cGo get some scotch and calm down,\u201d you send him out.</p><p>\nCrowley glares before snapping some clothes on himself and stalking\nout. You take a deep breath before turning to the angel who was\nprofoundly ruffled.</p><p>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking of him,\u201d you straighten out\nhis tie. \u201cMy visions have been leading me to the conclusion that if\nthings play out then Crowley dies and I might have to go with\nLucifer.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAh. Forgive me, I did not know.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo you\u2019re asking him to choose between the child\u2019s death or his\ndeath and my possible enslavement. He\u2019s not going to readily agree.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan I show you? I just need someone to understand me,\u201d he holds\nout two fingers hesitantly.</p><p>\n\u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><p>\nIt\u2019s hard to describe the scene you see. It\u2019s overwhelming in a way.\nYou just know an innate sense of peace, of relaxation. It\u2019s like\nyou\u2019re standing on top of a mountain watching the sun rise. It\u2019s\njust\u2026hopeful. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThis is the vision the child gave to me. That is his intentions.\nHe only wants to help. He\u2026uh\u2026.wants me to mentor him.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe wants you to be his dad instead?\u201d you blink as the room comes\nback into focus. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIn a sense,\u201d Castiel nods. \u201cBut that is what I want to fight\nfor.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCan he keep me and Crowley safe?\u201d you ask.</p><p>\n\u201cIf he senses no ill will from you then yes he will because I will\ntell him you are good people\u2026well, <i>you</i> are a good person.\nYour child will no doubt be a good person.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf this is the gamble we have to take to bring everlasting\npeace\u2026.I suppose I\u2019ve nearly died for less,\u201d you take a breath.</p><p>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the angel grabs your shoulders, looking at you\nintensely. \u201cI knew you would understand me. You are my greatest\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to butter me up, you know. I already agreed.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou agreed?\u201d comes Crowley\u2019s voice as he returns with a large\nbottle of Craig he\u2019s drinking directly from. \u201cI could swear you\u2019ve\nlost your marbles lately, kitten.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThis nephilim can keep us safe,\u201d you reiterate. \u201cHonestly,\nthis is the most hopeful I\u2019ve been since I started having these\nstupid prophecies.\u201d</p><p>\nCrowley\u2019s face falls a little at that. He knows he can\u2019t argue.\nAnything to cling onto was better than blind faith that the world\nwould right itself.</p><p>\n\u201cFeathers, leave us,\u201d Crowley dismisses Castiel with a wave. \u201cI\nneed to talk to her alone.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cVery well. I will update Tabitha on how Kelly is progressing and\nkeep an eye on her own pregnancy also.\u201d</p><p>\nThen he vanishes.</p><p>\nCrowley just stands there, one hand massaging his temple. He looks\nweary, older. \n</p><p>\n\u201cIs this really all we have to look forward to?\u201d he mutters. \u201cI\ndie and you become Lucifer\u2019s plaything?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWhat choice do we have? You know how fighting destiny goes. It\u2019s\nonly subvertable at the last second with the Winchesters involved.\u201d</p><p>\nCrowley snorts inelegantly, \u201cFair point, well made. Well\u2026.at\nleast there is one glimmer of hope now. If you believe this child can\nhelp, I trust you. At least mine will not kill you. I can take great\nstock that my legacy will live on.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he comes over to you, kissing you so messily\nyou can taste the alcohol. \u201cAnything as long as it\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI love you. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDarling, I don\u2019t think there was a grand enough gesture like\nsuicidally getting me to knock you up just so you could keep\nsomething of me around,\u201d he smirks. \u201cMakes a demon feel wanted.\nNow, I must insist that if I am to get the rest of this pent up\nenergy out that I thoroughly fuck you right here and now in my coat\nbecause it looks simply criminal on you.\u201d</p><p>\nThe next thing you know you\u2019re being thrown on the bed.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n\u201cOh Tabbbbbyyyyyy,\u201d comes that voice.</p><p>\n\u201cGo away,\u201d you hiss.</p><p>\n\u201cAww come on, sweetcheeks. I gave you a few weeks reprieve. Wasn\u2019t\nthat kind of me?\u201d Lucifer pouts. \u201cI hear we\u2019re getting to the\nendgame. These demons looooove to gossip. You\u2019ve been having visions\nabout me, haven\u2019t you? Visions where you come to me of your own free\nwill?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGO AWAY!\u201d you say more strongly.</p><p>\n\u201cNuh uh,\u201d he wags a finger. \u201cSee, I remember your reaction when\nI projected that little image into your nugget. You weren\u2019t exactly\nhorrified. I didn\u2019t ruin your fun with Crowley. That says to me that\non some level, you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cJust stop hounding me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t deny yourself what you want,\u201d he\u2019s approaching you. \u201cYou\nwant me. I know you do. You\u2019re just scared of hurting Crowley.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d</p><p>\nThen the world dissolves into that room. You\u2019re by a large bay\nwindow, the doors open wide as the summer breeze tickles at your\nskin. You can feel the heat, magnified through the glass, bathing you\nas you look out at the view.</p><p>\n\u201cMy love,\u201d Lucifer says from behind you.</p><p>\nYou turn to see him, shirtless, his wings in a relaxed position. He\u2019s\njust bathing in the flow of the sun like you are.</p><p>\nYou can\u2019t control your actions as you move towards him, placing a\nhand on his chest and snaking it up to his neck. You usually have a\nmodicum of control in these kind of dreams but it\u2019s like you\u2019re\nviewing a movie through your own perspective.</p><p>\n\u201cYou have no idea how happy you made me when you chose to come with\nme,\u201d Lucifer murmurs softly.</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit, at first I thought you were just obsessed. Like a\nteenage crush or something,\u201d you hear your own voice say.</p><p>\n\u201cNo, Tabitha. It\u2019s love,\u201d he pushes your hair back behind your\near. \u201cIt\u2019s a bond, it\u2019s unity. You are mine and I am yours.\u201d</p><p>\nYour hand drags up to the bridge of his wing before tracing gently\nthrough the feathers. He sighs contentedly, pulling you closer.</p><p>\n\u201cI will never let you go,\u201d he leans down, capturing your lips in\na kiss.</p><p>\nSurely dreams should not be this tactile? Surely you should not be\nable to feel the warmth of his breath, the caress of his fingers, the\nchill of his skin? You also caught a waft of scent now and then as\nhis wings rippled, the smell of a warm summer\u2019s evening.</p><p>\nWas this a dream? Was it <i>just</i> a dream? Could this be\u2026a prophecy?\nWas this what was to come after the grey world?</p><p>\nYou found your emotions getting more and more tangled as Lucifer\ndeepened the kiss and you remembered the last time you\u2019d done this,\nwhen you\u2019d done this willingly. It was confusing knowing how serene\nand almost gentleman-like he could be contrasted with his vicious and\nspiteful side. \n</p><p>\nThen it was like you\u2019d blinked because one second you were upright\nand kissing him and the next you were on the bed. Lucifer was naked\nabove you and you had no clothes on either. You might have been\nchilled to the bone with Lucifer\u2019s temperature but somehow the baking\nsunlight coming through the windows was keeping you warm.</p><p>\n\u201cIt will be my honour to claim you as mine,\u201d Lucifer smiles\nlopsidedly. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThen do it,\u201d your voice is full of lust.</p><p>\n\u201cAfter I properly revere you.\u201d</p><p>\nHe wanted to explore every inch of you, mouthing at you, kissing you,\nbiting you. You felt relaxed, you felt peaceful as his mouth hovered\nin between your legs.</p><p>\n\u201cI never got to taste such a pure creature last time,\u201d he smirks.</p><p>\nThen the scene flips again and there\u2019s this almost heavy feeling in\nyour legs like you get after an orgasm. Lucifer\u2019s fully on top of\nyou, cock ready and waiting as he searches your face for permission.</p><p>\n\u201cSay yes to me, Tabitha. Say yes to being mine and I swear I will\nkeep you safe for eternity. You will be mine, you\u2019ll bear my family,\nyou\u2019ll fight alongside me against our enemies. Say yes.\u201d</p><p>\nHe kisses you hard and you can feel him press his cock to your\nentrance, holding himself back with great difficulty.</p><p>\n\u201cSay yes to me.\u201d</p><p>\nTo your horror, the next words you say are, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\nThe next sensation you feel is being full, so full you\u2019re being\nstretched as he eases into you. How can you feel that with such\nperfect detail?!</p><p>\n\u201cYou make me so happy,\u201d he murmurs before fully driving himself\nin to the hilt.</p><p>\n<br><br></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou awake with a start, flailing as though the spectre of the Dream\nLucifer could be pushed off you. You\u2019re mortified to realise there\u2019s\na dull throbbing ache between your legs, that you got aroused by what\nyou had seen. \n</p><p>\nYou\u2019re just lucky Crowley wasn\u2019t next to you because you know he\nwould\u2019ve heard your panicked thoughts just now. He didn\u2019t need to\nknow how much you were being tormented by this.</p><p><i>Did\nyou enjoy that? Oh you did, you bad baaaaad girl. Come see what\u2019s\nkickin\u2019 in the throne room, Tabby. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it.</i></p><p>\nYou hastily scramble, pulling on jeans and a t-shirt before rushing\nout to the throne room, past several demons who give excited\nwhispers. You throw open the double doors to see Crowley on the floor\nand Lucifer on the throne, one leg crooked over the arm rest.</p><p>\n\u201cHi cupcake,\u201d he smiles sweetly at you. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTabitha, get out!\u201d Crowley roars through his pain.</p><p>\nLucifer flicks his wrist and you hear an audible crack as Crowley\u2019s\nback seems to bend unnaturally far backwards.</p><p>\n\u201cStop it!\u201d you yell, running forward to grab him, to protect him.</p><p>\n\u201cHmmm, nah,\u201d Lucifer shrugs. \u201cHe was mean to me. I don\u2019t like\nmean people. Hey, here\u2019s a neat idea. I\u2019ll tell you something that\nCrowley did that\u2019ll mean you don\u2019t like him any more.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf it\u2019s about my parents, I already know,\u201d you fire back.</p><p>\nLucifer gives a moody pout before drumming his fingers on the arm\nrests of the throne, \u201cCrowley, you\u2019re no fun. I expected you to be\nmore of a coward.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBite me,\u201d Crowley growls back, gritting his teeth through the\npain.</p><p>\n\u201cYou know, I might, so don\u2019t test me,\u201d Lucifer snarls. \u201cFineeee,\nhow about this then, Crowley? I\u2019ve been sending sex dreams to Tabitha\nfor weeks now and she just <i>loves</i> them, don\u2019t you baby?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIf by love you mean I want to claw my own brain out after them\nthen yeah,\u201d you hiss. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me? Why not\nshack up with Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cKelly was sweet and all but she had no fire,\u201d Lucifer muses.\n\u201cYou, on the other hand, you\u2019re the only human female in creation\nthat\u2019s told me no. You\u2019re the only one who ever tried to understand\nme. You are the human I\u2019m meant to have so if Crowley could just\u2026I\ndon\u2019t know\u2026die? Gee, that would be swell.\u201d</p><p>\nAnother crack as Crowley\u2019s arm snaps in two and you\u2019re trying to hold\nhim as he falls sideways.</p><p>\n\u201cCas!\u201d you shout.</p><p>\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Lucifer leans forward. \u201cMy little\nbro ain\u2019t gonna help this. I\u2019ll find you. I always will. I hope\nyou\u2019re good at being a stepmom by the way.\u201d</p><p>\nThere\u2019s a flap of wings behind you before you\u2019re deposited in the\nbunker, screaming your lungs out for the boys. There\u2019s a crash as\ndoors open and the running of footsteps before Sam, Dean and Mary\nburst into your bedroom. \n</p><p>\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?!\u201d Dean says in alarm, taking in\nCrowley\u2019s near unconscious state. \n</p><p>\n\u201cLucifer,\u201d Castiel says for you. \u201cAppears he came for the\nthrone of Hell. He\u2019s in his old vessel.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Dean mutters. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cPeachy,\u201d Crowley groans. \n</p><p>\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to go after Kelly,\u201d you tell Castiel. \u201cHe kept\nsaying he wants me to be a stepmum to the kid. Go make sure she\u2019s\nfine.\u201d</p><p>\nThe angel disappears.</p><p>\n\u201cTell us what the hell is going on, Tabitha,\u201d Sam kneels down,\nhelping you bring Crowley onto the bed.</p><p>\n\u201cCrowley found Lucifer\u2019s essence and stuffed it into a vessel that\nwas bound with bits of the cage,\u201d you rattle off. \u201cSomehow he\nbroke out of the control. He was meant to be contained until we could\nget Kelly\u2019s kid but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHow long have you known this?\u201d Dean asks suspiciously.</p><p>\n\u201cLike a month,\u201d you meet his gaze defiantly.</p><p>\n\u201cTabs, we said no more secrets,\u201d Dean sighs long and hard.\n\u201cSweetheart, you need to start trusting us more. We could\u2019ve\nhelped.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTrust me, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d you stand up. \u201cHe would\u2019ve said\nanything to you to rile you up.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSo we need to go get to Kelly,\u201d Mary cuts in. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m\ntaking from this. Correct?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes, we need to move now. I assume Cas has told you about his\nplans?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYeah but we still think he\u2019s nuts for it,\u201d Sam adds. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI am perfectly stable,\u201d Castiel says as he reappears. \u201cKelly\nsays\u2026uh\u2026well she shouted that her water has broken. I need\nassistance.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTake us all,\u201d you say firmly. \u201cI think this is going to be the\nlast stand off soon.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere without us,\u201d Toni says from the\ndoorway, flanked by Mick.</p><p>\n\u201cDo you live here now?!\u201d you hiss.</p><p>\n\u201cTrust me, I wouldn\u2019t choose to live somewhere this odious,\u201d she\ncurls her lip. \u201cBut you\u2019re not letting a nephilim be born. It\u2019s\nagainst the code.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, Tabitha,\u201d Mick nods. \u201cIt\u2019s too powerful.\u201d</p><p>\nToni holds up a gun whilst Mick uses a knife to slice open his palm,\ndrawing the angel banishing sigil on the wall.</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, you Brit dickbags!\u201d Dean yells.</p><p>\n\u201cOnly way, mate,\u201d Mick shrugs apologetically.</p><p>\nBefore he can slam his hand on it, there\u2019s two gunshots and blood\nexplodes from their faces. They drop to the floor, bodies thudding\nheavily to reveal Ketch standing behind them.</p><p>\n\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d you shout. \u201cArthur?!\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTheir termination orders had come through,\u201d he says quaintly,\nimperceptibly nodding at Mary.</p><p>\nYou knew that was bollocks. More likely he\u2019d done it before he was\nafraid for Mary\u2019s safety but it still shocked you. You looked away\nfrom the bodies on the floor, trying not to process it.</p><p>\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Castiel says, healing Crowley before gathering\neveryone in a circle once they had tooled up.</p><p>\n\u201cGo Team Free Will,\u201d Dean says grimly. \u201cEnd of days part sixty\nfive.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cEveryone ready?\u201d Sam asks.</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\u201d you murmur quietly. \u201cBut let\u2019s do this anyway.\u201d</p><p>\nYou give one last scared look to Crowley who returns it before you\nvanish out of the bunker.</p><p>_____\u00a0</p><p>Taglist:</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <strike>@wolfygecko</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_LK6GlOtQQcl2UWq0WM-g\">@fairytale07</a></p></p>",

Angst</i></p><p><b>Chapter 47 - Overruled</b></p><p><i>(Proof reading errors likely)</i></p><p><i>A/N: This is a long ass chapter guys, Strap in.</i></p><p>________</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh Crowleyyyyy,&rdquo; Lucifer had cooed to him telepathically as Crowley fucked you hard on the throne. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a private chat,\ndevil to demon.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Get stuffed,&rdquo; Crowley thought back. &ldquo;Busy here.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna listen because I know you still haven&rsquo;t told her\nabout her parents yet,&rdquo; comes the derisive response. &ldquo;This will\nbe the last time you touch her. Let me out of the bonds of this\nvessel and I&rsquo;ll spare your miserable existence. Don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;ll sing\nlike a canary.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Crowley mentally shrugs. &ldquo;Try it.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe watches Lucifer bluster for a split second before an expression of\nrage comes over his face and then he focuses his attention back to\nyou.</p><p>\nCrowley knew he was trying to converse with you in a similar manner.\nHe couldn&rsquo;t read your thoughts any more because of it. He just hoped you&rsquo;d be\nstrong enough to resist his charms this time. \n</p><p>\nHe uses his essence to help your orgasm along, trying to rip you out\nof the internal conversation and he grunts as he feels you clench and\npulse around him. Then he can hear your thoughts again.</p><p>\n&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s never going to stop</i>,&rdquo; you kept thinking over and over.\n&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;ll never stop until he has me.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>\nOf all the things in creation that you&rsquo;d fought, Crowley knew\nLucifer&rsquo;s obsession with you scared you the most. Not even a display\nlike this had been a big enough clue for the idiot feather duster that you didn&rsquo;t want him.</p><p>\nThen he found his own release, his cock twitching inside you. You\nalways felt marvellous around him. So tight, so willing.</p><p>\nThen Crowley&rsquo;s mouth gets the better of him and he&rsquo;s in a war of\nwords with Lucifer, causing the archangel to bristle. That seemed to\nmake you stiffen to an unnatural degree before Crowley leaned around\nand saw your eyes glaze over. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;If it saves the world Dean, what choice do I have? I&rsquo;ll go with\nhim,&rdquo; you say dully.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I wonder if she&rsquo;s talking about little old me,&rdquo; Lucifer grins\ncheekily, looking at Crowley out of the tops of his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like\nto think she&rsquo;d come round to my way of thinking eventually.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to run. Don&rsquo;t make me,&rdquo; you start picking up speed\nin your babbling and Crowley knew he needed to get you out before\nLucifer took this as a sign of victory.</p><p>\nHe appeared with you in the bedroom, quite beside himself with worry\nas he held you close, listening to horrible things that you were\npredicting. They were things that told him there was a choice to\nmake, a choice to save humanity but it was likely that either meant\nyou went with Lucifer or Crowley died. Neither of those were\nappealing. Neither of those he could bear to listen to as you sounded\nlike you were imitating a sobbing voice, <i>your</i> voice from the\nfuture.</p><p><i>Well&hellip;.bloody\nhell.</i></p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\nAfter your phone conversation with Dean, Crowley seems to be looking\nat you intensely. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Darling, there&rsquo;s something I need to tell you,&rdquo; Crowley starts.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What did you do this time?&rdquo; you automatically say, feeling your\nstomach flip. &ldquo;You never use that voice unless you messed up.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I found out very very recently,&rdquo; he sighs. &ldquo;I\njust needed to confirm if it was true or not.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabitha, this might change things between us.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m in this for the long game now,&rdquo; you laugh a\nlittle bitterly. &ldquo;So just get it over with. Who is she?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Crowley blinks. &ldquo;Who is who?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; your eyes widen. &ldquo;Okay, you didn&rsquo;t stray then, that&rsquo;s\nsomething.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Why on earth would I do that, you certifiable woman?&rdquo; Crowley is\nbewildered. &ldquo;Why would that even enter your mind?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Something Lucifer said to me just now,&rdquo; you bite your lip,\nlooking at the sheets.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Is he speaking to you telepathically?&rdquo; Crowley becomes very\nangry. &ldquo;Abominable git! Pet, you are the top of the chain and why\nwould I try and find anything as good as that when there isn&rsquo;t? No I\nhaven&rsquo;t betrayed you. This is to do with your parents.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I mean your <i>real</i> parents,&rdquo; Crowley sighs again. &ldquo;Before\nyou and Alistair were adopted.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You mean&hellip;.did you&hellip;.did you kill them or something?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Your mother, she made a deal,&rdquo; Crowley tells you. &ldquo;She\ncouldn&rsquo;t have children, see. She asked for ten years of fertility so\nI gave them to her. That&rsquo;s how you and your brother came to be. When\nit was time to collect&hellip;.there were more casualties than was\nexpected. It was the Marchioness disaster.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying you had a hand in my birth?&rdquo; you try and wrap\nyour head around it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure whether that&rsquo;s creepy or fate at\nthis point.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You know, I was expecting rather more shouting than is currently\nhappening,&rdquo; Crowley surveys you.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you shrug. &ldquo;I never knew my birth parents.\nIt would be unfair of me to get angry over something like this. You\ndidn&rsquo;t know I would be the product of it. I can&rsquo;t hate you for a\ndecision my mother made.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;d never seen the King of Hell relax as much as he did. Crowley\nalmost fell back into the sheets with relief.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Darling, I love you. You are just the most exquisite example of\nmortal divinity.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to suggest they&rsquo;ll make me a saint again after I\ndie, I&rsquo;ll throw this pillow at you,&rdquo; you scowl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nobody&rsquo;s\nangel. I just fucked a demon in front of the devil.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;That you did,&rdquo; Crowley purrs, running a hand along your waist.\n&ldquo;Very bold and very brave. I know he was trying to speak to you\nmost of the time. Is he saying anything now?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Only the usual,&rdquo; you mutter. &ldquo;That he&rsquo;ll kill you, he&rsquo;ll kill\nthe Winchesters and I&rsquo;ll be some queen of the dawn or other.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Not if I kill him first,&rdquo; Crowley grumbles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pluck him\nand roast him like a Christmas turkey.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou wince, hearing that saccharin voice of Lucifer&rsquo;s invading your\nhead again.</p><p><i>Tabbbbbbyyyyyyyyy,\noh my little cutesy wutesy little kitty cat? Answer me baby. Did you\nlike my show for you? I promise you, tonight&rsquo;s will be even better.</i></p><p>\n&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t shut up,&rdquo; you hiss, clenching your hands over your\nears. &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m going mad.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you out of Hell. Distance will help,&rdquo; Crowley frowns,\nredressing you with a snap of his fingers and then vanishing with you\nback into the bunker.</p><p>\nImmediately the archangel&rsquo;s voice dims to where you can&rsquo;t even make\nout individual words. The relief was immense.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you say earnestly. &ldquo;Being a prophet sucks balls.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Such an interesting turn of phrase,&rdquo; Crowley chuckles. &ldquo;And\nyes, I&rsquo;ll never forgive God for pulling that little stunt.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a flash where you see Crowley in the grey world, screaming in\nagony before it&rsquo;s gone just as suddenly as it started. The more you\nkeep seeing, the more you&rsquo;re certain you&rsquo;re going to lose him. You\njust want to shirk all your hunter responsibilities, spend as much\ntime with Crowley as you can. Then a mad idea comes to you.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Take me again,&rdquo; you nip at his neck.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Already? Darling, &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a machine.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not up to it?&rdquo; you tease. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I may not be a machine but I <i>am</i> Crowley and I am always up for\nravishing you. What&rsquo;s brought this mood on?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I just need you again.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a click and you&rsquo;re disrobed before you practically pounce on\nhim. He seems shocked at first but he play fights with you, pinning\nyou to the bed with his demonic essence.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Wicked girl,&rdquo; he smirks. &ldquo;And all mine.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley, just fuck me,&rdquo; you beg.</p><p>\n&ldquo;How can I refuse such a pretty request like that?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re still slick from the sex you had earlier and he has no trouble\ngliding his cock into you, stretching you out around him. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s aim for a quickie,&rdquo; he whispers in your ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nfairly certain there&rsquo;s the Winchester brood not so far away and your\nold colleagues.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Then come on,&rdquo; you grab his hips, urging him to roll forward.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Very <i>very</i> eager,&rdquo; he purrs. &ldquo;My my.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe covers your mouth with his hand before taking an almost feral\npace. He&rsquo;s driving himself home, desperately trying to keep his own\nsounds to small groans and curse words in a language you don&rsquo;t\nunderstand. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the quick method for you, my love,&rdquo; he rasps and you\ncan see the tendrils of his power snake across your body, feeling\nlike hands were pawing at every inch of you. &ldquo;Come now, I want to\nfeel you shake in my arms.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe mouths at your neck, leaving tiny bites in his wake until you\njerk, your orgasm barrelling across you as you half scream into his\npalm. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh I do love those noises you make, kitten,&rdquo; he groans. &ldquo;I\nshan&rsquo;t be far behind.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley, do what you did when Lucifer was riding shotgun,&rdquo; you\nsay seriously. &ldquo;Switch off the thing that makes you infertile.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe stops dead, looking horrified, &ldquo;Absolutely not! Are you bloody\nmad?! I almost killed you the last time!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;And Chuck said I wouldn&rsquo;t have survived <i>that</i> time but didn&rsquo;t say I\nwould <i>never</i> survive it,&rdquo; you argue. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Why are you so insistent, darling?&rdquo; he looks grave. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m scared I&rsquo;ll lose you soon and I&rsquo;m trying to cling on\nin any way I can,&rdquo; you admit.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh you silly silly girl,&rdquo; he kisses all over your face. &ldquo;If I\ndie, I wouldn&rsquo;t want you tethered to me in such a way. I&rsquo;d want you\nto move on.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, I want this,&rdquo; you protest. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;If this is just to be more certain of us rather than you and\nLucifer, Tabitha, do not risk your life. I would infinitely prefer\nyou to go to the Devil for comfort than be ripped apart by my child.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my choice to make,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re getting stubborn now.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Please, my love,&rdquo; he says softly. &ldquo;I would never be happy\nknowing I&rsquo;d condemned you a second time.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Castiel to check me out. It takes quickly, right? Then I\ncan see if it&rsquo;s worth it. Just for now&hellip;indulge me. If all these\nvisions are leading where I think they&rsquo;re leading, I want something\nof you here still.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You are a hopeless romantic, Miss Hetherington,&rdquo; his eyes\ntwinkle a little. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t deserve such fierce love. Very well,\nI&rsquo;ll do what you ask but if there&rsquo;s the slightest sense of you dying,\nI&rsquo;ll stop this in its tracks, understand?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Now, where were we, ah yes. Here.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe drives hard into you and you swear like a sailor, raking his back\nwhich makes him only pound harder. He&rsquo;s chasing his release quickly,\nstill keen not to get caught by anyone in the bunker. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I love you, you idiotic hunter,&rdquo; he breathes before pushing as\nfar as he can go, spilling into you with a coarse grunt. \n</p><p>\nIt&rsquo;s much the same sensation as last time. There&rsquo;s a soreness and\npressure in your abdomen that wouldn&rsquo;t usually happen with sex. You\nfeel a lot hungrier already.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s taken,&rdquo; Crowley announces. &ldquo;I still think you&rsquo;re a bloody\nlunatic for doing this but I will never deny you what you want, my\nkitten. If this is to be my legacy then for the love of all things\nsacred, do <i>not</i> give them a traditional Scottish name.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well what else goes with MacLeod?&rdquo; you snort. &ldquo;Or is the last\nname to be Crowley?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh please spare me the indignation of passing my family name\ndown,&rdquo; he rolls his eyes. &ldquo;Use your own. It&rsquo;s much more elegant.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley I-&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I know, pet, I know. I&rsquo;m frightened too. Being told by your lover\nthat you&rsquo;ve got a time limit is not an easy thing to process.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t want you unprepared.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he nods. &ldquo;I can make preparations now. I assume I\nbite the dust during some prize fight with Lucifer so I hope it looks\ngood at least. Does it happen&hellip;.soon?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I think the closer I get the more visions I have.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well&hellip;.buggeration then.&rdquo;</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou rejoined the little hunting party in the bunker after that,\nbeelining straight for Sam and Dean and giving them a hug. They\nreturn it wholeheartedly, squishing you all into a trio of limbs.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hey, good to see you too, princess,&rdquo; Dean chuckles. &ldquo;Miss us?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh definitely,&rdquo; you roll your eyes. &ldquo;I always love having\nsomebody around to fight me for the last muffin in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Competition is healthy,&rdquo; Dean winks.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Pretty sure it&rsquo;s not, Dean,&rdquo; Sam sighs. &ldquo;Everything okay with\nyou? I know you had to face Toni again.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I almost shot her but I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; you step back, trying to see if\nthey were still around. &ldquo;Do we have company or is it just us?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Just us but..uh&hellip;.mom wants to speak to you,&rdquo; Sam shifts\nawkwardly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What happened? Did something go wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nah, nothing like that,&rdquo; Dean shakes his head. &ldquo;Think she just\nwants to run something by you. She&rsquo;s in the library.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll swing by there now.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Good, I need to speak to Crowley about the Kelly situation.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a little t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te then,&rdquo; Crowley sits down at\nthe table. &ldquo;Pool our resources together because the last thing I\nwant is an heir of Lucifer&rsquo;s challenging my claim to the throne.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou leave them to it, wandering into the library and seeing Mary\nlooking over some gadgets and weapons that you know Mick has provided\nher. You missed having access to stuff like this but it also showed\nyou didn&rsquo;t need fancy items to get the job done.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Ah good,&rdquo; she smiles kindly at you. &ldquo;Come here. I need a girl\nchat.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to talk about boys, are we?&rdquo; you hesitate.\n&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m woefully inadequate in that area.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well, for a start, you&rsquo;re dating a demon and not a boy,&rdquo; she\nlaughs. &ldquo;But I get your point. No, this is to do with the Men of\nLetters as a whole.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Were they okay with you? If they hurt you in any way-&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she places a hand on your shoulder. &ldquo;I\njust&hellip;.Mick&rsquo;s a good guy. I think he really does actually wanna make\na go of this alliance.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with Mick,&rdquo; you say honestly. &ldquo;My\nproblem is with Toni&hellip;and sometimes with Ketch depending on whether\nhe&rsquo;s chasing me or not.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThere was something about the way Mary&rsquo;s eyes flashed when you\nmentioned Ketch that you couldn&rsquo;t help but notice. It was strange,\nalmost like&hellip;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Are you&hellip;.<i>involved</i> with Ketch?&rdquo; you probe.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hunters,&rdquo; she sighs. &ldquo;They see everything. We may\nhave&hellip;.bonded whilst going to fetch my boys. He&rsquo;s not as scary as\nhis reputation.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I know he isn&rsquo;t but he&rsquo;s dangerous in other ways,&rdquo; you say\nfirmly, trying to make her understand. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never fallen in love\nin the whole time I&rsquo;ve known him and that&rsquo;s almost some two decades\nnow.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not after love, sweetie. Just a connection. For me, it&rsquo;s only\nbeen about a few weeks since I was with John, remember? Just promise\nme that you won&rsquo;t tell Sam and Dean, okay? I don&rsquo;t think they need to\nget protective.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my place to tell them. If you really want this alliance\nthen I&rsquo;ll go along with it but I really can&rsquo;t promise I won&rsquo;t shoot\nToni if she gets out of line. There&rsquo;s something bad coming and it\nmakes her petty jealously look incredibly insignificant in the grand\nscheme of things.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;How bad?&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s face falls.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s going to die and I&rsquo;m not sure whether it&rsquo;ll be me or\nCrowley,&rdquo; you confide in her. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell anyone that\neither. A secret for a secret.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabitha, I&rsquo;ll try my damnedest to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.\nYou&rsquo;re becoming part of the family, I mean, hell you&rsquo;re already a\npart of Dean and Sam&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well if we&rsquo;re all keeping secrets then yeah, I&rsquo;m a Winchester,&rdquo;\nyou laugh.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Sometimes I wish we were a normal family again,&rdquo; Mary looks off\nwistfully. &ldquo;I miss those days I used to cook Dean pancakes and read\nto Sam at night. Azazel stole my best years with them.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Now you have a chance to reconnect.&rdquo;</p><p>\nShe puts her arm around your shoulders, squashing you to her fondly,\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Now, tell me everything about these prophecies you\nhave. I&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help.&rdquo;</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nFive weeks pass and Lucifer never delivers on his promise to give you\na &lsquo;show&rsquo;. In fact, you don&rsquo;t dream at all in that time.</p><p>\nYou go on hunts with Sam, Dean, Mary and Ketch. Toni is left behind\non your insistence, helping Mick to wrangle the American hunter\nnetwork that you&rsquo;ve told them about, giving over your contact lists. \n</p><p>\nSurprisingly it works well. The access to the gadgets makes hunting\nso much easier and what would have taken four days takes one. The\ndatabase of lore from the Cambridge headquarters speeds up research\ntime also, although Mick primarily takes charge of that for you.</p><p>\nThe only awkward thing is Mary keeps relying on you to cover for her\nwhilst she sneaks off with Ketch. You feel a little like a high\nschooler, trying to protect a friend from their parents finding out. \n</p><p>\nCrowley keeps visiting often, checking in on how you&rsquo;re doing and\nbringing you to Hell where he can lie with you some nights. With all\nthe increase in monster activity, you&rsquo;ve both not be able to get five\nminutes to call Castiel to assess you but as you&rsquo;re cuddled into\nCrowley&rsquo;s arms, stark naked under the silk sheets, you get the shock\nof your life when the angel appears at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Really, Feathers, I think you&rsquo;re starting to enjoy this,&rdquo;\nCrowley raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;You have a habit of dropping in when\nclothing&rsquo;s been shed.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;There was no time to send warning. Fabric is immaterial to the\nconversation,&rdquo; Castiel says in a slightly more animated voice than\nusual. &ldquo;I have Kelly Kline.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;In your trenchcoat pocket?&rdquo; Crowley sasses.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Obviously not,&rdquo; the angel frowns. &ldquo;In a safe location. I need\nto speak with Tabitha before I consult Sam and Dean. I feel she would\nbe more receptive to what I have to say.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; Crowley waves his hand. &ldquo;But I would\nlike you to do something for her.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant again,&rdquo; you take a deep breath. &ldquo;Crowley wants to\nknow if I&rsquo;ll survive it.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;ve never seen quite an expression like it on Castiel&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s\nalmost like a disappointed parent.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley, how is this keeping her safe like our agreement?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;She asked me to,&rdquo; Crowley holds up both hands. &ldquo;Begged me to,\nin fact. So please, indulge me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Why would you choose this?&rdquo; Castiel seems baffled. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my reasons,&rdquo; you murmur. &ldquo;Prophet type reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t ignore the word of God, can we?&rdquo; Crowley chips in.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I frequently have ignored the word of God,&rdquo; Castiel moves to\nyou. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the 'rebel angel&rsquo;, remember? God was not what I expected\neither.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yes, yes, just assess her you monotonous twit,&rdquo; Crowley rolls\nhis eyes.</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a funny feeling as Castiel moves his hand over your stomach\nand you see the soft glow of a light underneath his fingers. He\nfurrows his brow, concentrating hard until he steps back.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re dying this time. When Lucifer was in my\nvessel, he did this and the sensation is different.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;So she&rsquo;ll survive it?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I believe so, providing nothing kills her beforehand.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Ever the ray of sunshine,&rdquo; Crowley sighs before kissing your\nforehead. &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s one blessed relief.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What did you want to talk to me about, Cas?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t\nexactly get up right now.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I have seen naked humans before. I was there at the creation,&rdquo;\nCastiel says bluntly. &ldquo;But I understand your discomfort. Very well,\nmy issue is that I do not want to kill Kelly&rsquo;s baby.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, come again?&rdquo; Crowley blinks. &ldquo;A nephilim and you\ndon&rsquo;t want to smite it?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;He?&rdquo; you&rsquo;re confused.</p><p>\n&ldquo;When I found Kelly, she had attempted suicide. She was being held\nby Dagon. Evidently Crowley, you are not keeping favour in Hell. The\nPrinces are trying to protect the baby.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Get to the point, Cas,&rdquo; you interrupt.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yes, well then. The baby brought Kelly back to life and showed me\na future where peace reigned. I believe this child will help the\nworld. I cannot destroy it. The reason I am telling you, Tabitha, is\nbecause you understand. You believe in Crowley so much you want to\ntry and have his child again even though he is a demon. Do you think\nyour child would be inherently evil?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I would like to believe in nurture versus nature.\nThere are monsters that can reject their nature out there.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;This is my point. Nephilims from any other angel would not be\nconsidered evil but there is an assumption that because it is\nLucifer&rsquo;s that it will be bad,&rdquo; Castiel nods. &ldquo;This child is not\nbad. This child is good, I can see that. Can you trust my judgement?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; Crowley cuts in. &ldquo;This is Lucifer&rsquo;s child. Think\nvery carefully. If you let it live, if Lucifer lives-&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It was in one of my visions,&rdquo; you sigh. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;You saw that the child lives?&rdquo; Castiel asks.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yes. Lucifer mentioned something about &lsquo;picking up his kid&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Then it has to live. If we try to subvert fate, it could be\ncatastrophic.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;But the end result is catastrophic according to her visions. If we\nhave a chance to change the course of destiny then why not?&rdquo;\nCrowley becomes frustrated. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eliminate one of the variables\nright now.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;But if this variable brings peace and balance then that is\nselfish,&rdquo; Castiel matches his tone. &ldquo;How did you feel when God\nkilled <i>your</i> child?&rdquo;</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a streak of colour that goes across your vision and a blur of\nred as you realise Crowley has launched himself at the angel,\ndragging the bedsheets along with him. You manage to whip a pillow in\nfront of you to keep your modesty before rushing to the chair where\nCrowley&rsquo;s overcoat is, rapidly pulling it onto yourself before you\ntry and intervene.</p><p>\n&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; Crowley roars, fighting with Castiel, completely\nnaked, grabbing him into a headlock. &ldquo;Do not use my own tragedy for\nyour idiotic arguments! You divine pond scum!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley, stop it!&rdquo; you yell, trying to pull him off but Crowley\nwas infinitely stronger than you were.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I ought to rip you apart!&rdquo; Crowley continues shouting whilst\nCastiel struggles out of his grip.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to save humanity!&rdquo; Castiel chokes out.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Do so on your own dime, you insensitive wretch!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;STOP FIGHTING!&rdquo; you get in the middle of them. &ldquo;Cas made a\nmistake, okay. It was a poor choice of words.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky she&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Crowley snarls, pointing at Castiel.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Go get some scotch and calm down,&rdquo; you send him out.</p><p>\nCrowley glares before snapping some clothes on himself and stalking\nout. You take a deep breath before turning to the angel who was\nprofoundly ruffled.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking of him,&rdquo; you straighten out\nhis tie. &ldquo;My visions have been leading me to the conclusion that if\nthings play out then Crowley dies and I might have to go with\nLucifer.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Ah. Forgive me, I did not know.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re asking him to choose between the child&rsquo;s death or his\ndeath and my possible enslavement. He&rsquo;s not going to readily agree.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Can I show you? I just need someone to understand me,&rdquo; he holds\nout two fingers hesitantly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo;</p><p>\nIt&rsquo;s hard to describe the scene you see. It&rsquo;s overwhelming in a way.\nYou just know an innate sense of peace, of relaxation. It&rsquo;s like\nyou&rsquo;re standing on top of a mountain watching the sun rise. It&rsquo;s\njust&hellip;hopeful. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;This is the vision the child gave to me. That is his intentions.\nHe only wants to help. He&hellip;uh&hellip;.wants me to mentor him.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;He wants you to be his dad instead?&rdquo; you blink as the room comes\nback into focus. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;In a sense,&rdquo; Castiel nods. &ldquo;But that is what I want to fight\nfor.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Can he keep me and Crowley safe?&rdquo; you ask.</p><p>\n&ldquo;If he senses no ill will from you then yes he will because I will\ntell him you are good people&hellip;well, <i>you</i> are a good person.\nYour child will no doubt be a good person.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;If this is the gamble we have to take to bring everlasting\npeace&hellip;.I suppose I&rsquo;ve nearly died for less,&rdquo; you take a breath.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the angel grabs your shoulders, looking at you\nintensely. &ldquo;I knew you would understand me. You are my greatest\nfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to butter me up, you know. I already agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You agreed?&rdquo; comes Crowley&rsquo;s voice as he returns with a large\nbottle of Craig he&rsquo;s drinking directly from. &ldquo;I could swear you&rsquo;ve\nlost your marbles lately, kitten.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;This nephilim can keep us safe,&rdquo; you reiterate. &ldquo;Honestly,\nthis is the most hopeful I&rsquo;ve been since I started having these\nstupid prophecies.&rdquo;</p><p>\nCrowley&rsquo;s face falls a little at that. He knows he can&rsquo;t argue.\nAnything to cling onto was better than blind faith that the world\nwould right itself.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Feathers, leave us,&rdquo; Crowley dismisses Castiel with a wave. &ldquo;I\nneed to talk to her alone.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Very well. I will update Tabitha on how Kelly is progressing and\nkeep an eye on her own pregnancy also.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThen he vanishes.</p><p>\nCrowley just stands there, one hand massaging his temple. He looks\nweary, older. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Is this really all we have to look forward to?&rdquo; he mutters. &ldquo;I\ndie and you become Lucifer&rsquo;s plaything?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What choice do we have? You know how fighting destiny goes. It&rsquo;s\nonly subvertable at the last second with the Winchesters involved.&rdquo;</p><p>\nCrowley snorts inelegantly, &ldquo;Fair point, well made. Well&hellip;.at\nleast there is one glimmer of hope now. If you believe this child can\nhelp, I trust you. At least mine will not kill you. I can take great\nstock that my legacy will live on.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Boy or girl?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he comes over to you, kissing you so messily\nyou can taste the alcohol. &ldquo;Anything as long as it&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I love you. You know that right?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Darling, I don&rsquo;t think there was a grand enough gesture like\nsuicidally getting me to knock you up just so you could keep\nsomething of me around,&rdquo; he smirks. &ldquo;Makes a demon feel wanted.\nNow, I must insist that if I am to get the rest of this pent up\nenergy out that I thoroughly fuck you right here and now in my coat\nbecause it looks simply criminal on you.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThe next thing you know you&rsquo;re being thrown on the bed.</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh Tabbbbbyyyyyy,&rdquo; comes that voice.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; you hiss.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Aww come on, sweetcheeks. I gave you a few weeks reprieve. Wasn&rsquo;t\nthat kind of me?&rdquo; Lucifer pouts. &ldquo;I hear we&rsquo;re getting to the\nendgame. These demons looooove to gossip. You&rsquo;ve been having visions\nabout me, haven&rsquo;t you? Visions where you come to me of your own free\nwill?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;GO AWAY!&rdquo; you say more strongly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nuh uh,&rdquo; he wags a finger. &ldquo;See, I remember your reaction when\nI projected that little image into your nugget. You weren&rsquo;t exactly\nhorrified. I didn&rsquo;t ruin your fun with Crowley. That says to me that\non some level, you enjoyed it.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Just stop hounding me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny yourself what you want,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s approaching you. &ldquo;You\nwant me. I know you do. You&rsquo;re just scared of hurting Crowley.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not-&rdquo;</p><p>\nThen the world dissolves into that room. You&rsquo;re by a large bay\nwindow, the doors open wide as the summer breeze tickles at your\nskin. You can feel the heat, magnified through the glass, bathing you\nas you look out at the view.</p><p>\n&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; Lucifer says from behind you.</p><p>\nYou turn to see him, shirtless, his wings in a relaxed position. He&rsquo;s\njust bathing in the flow of the sun like you are.</p><p>\nYou can&rsquo;t control your actions as you move towards him, placing a\nhand on his chest and snaking it up to his neck. You usually have a\nmodicum of control in these kind of dreams but it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re\nviewing a movie through your own perspective.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You have no idea how happy you made me when you chose to come with\nme,&rdquo; Lucifer murmurs softly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit, at first I thought you were just obsessed. Like a\nteenage crush or something,&rdquo; you hear your own voice say.</p><p>\n&ldquo;No, Tabitha. It&rsquo;s love,&rdquo; he pushes your hair back behind your\near. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bond, it&rsquo;s unity. You are mine and I am yours.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYour hand drags up to the bridge of his wing before tracing gently\nthrough the feathers. He sighs contentedly, pulling you closer.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I will never let you go,&rdquo; he leans down, capturing your lips in\na kiss.</p><p>\nSurely dreams should not be this tactile? Surely you should not be\nable to feel the warmth of his breath, the caress of his fingers, the\nchill of his skin? You also caught a waft of scent now and then as\nhis wings rippled, the smell of a warm summer&rsquo;s evening.</p><p>\nWas this a dream? Was it <i>just</i> a dream? Could this be&hellip;a prophecy?\nWas this what was to come after the grey world?</p><p>\nYou found your emotions getting more and more tangled as Lucifer\ndeepened the kiss and you remembered the last time you&rsquo;d done this,\nwhen you&rsquo;d done this willingly. It was confusing knowing how serene\nand almost gentleman-like he could be contrasted with his vicious and\nspiteful side. \n</p><p>\nThen it was like you&rsquo;d blinked because one second you were upright\nand kissing him and the next you were on the bed. Lucifer was naked\nabove you and you had no clothes on either. You might have been\nchilled to the bone with Lucifer&rsquo;s temperature but somehow the baking\nsunlight coming through the windows was keeping you warm.</p><p>\n&ldquo;It will be my honour to claim you as mine,&rdquo; Lucifer smiles\nlopsidedly. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Then do it,&rdquo; your voice is full of lust.</p><p>\n&ldquo;After I properly revere you.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe wanted to explore every inch of you, mouthing at you, kissing you,\nbiting you. You felt relaxed, you felt peaceful as his mouth hovered\nin between your legs.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I never got to taste such a pure creature last time,&rdquo; he smirks.</p><p>\nThen the scene flips again and there&rsquo;s this almost heavy feeling in\nyour legs like you get after an orgasm. Lucifer&rsquo;s fully on top of\nyou, cock ready and waiting as he searches your face for permission.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Say yes to me, Tabitha. Say yes to being mine and I swear I will\nkeep you safe for eternity. You will be mine, you&rsquo;ll bear my family,\nyou&rsquo;ll fight alongside me against our enemies. Say yes.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe kisses you hard and you can feel him press his cock to your\nentrance, holding himself back with great difficulty.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Say yes to me.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTo your horror, the next words you say are, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThe next sensation you feel is being full, so full you&rsquo;re being\nstretched as he eases into you. How can you feel that with such\nperfect detail?!</p><p>\n&ldquo;You make me so happy,&rdquo; he murmurs before fully driving himself\nin to the hilt.</p><p>\n<br /><br /></p><p>\n**</p><p>\nYou awake with a start, flailing as though the spectre of the Dream\nLucifer could be pushed off you. You&rsquo;re mortified to realise there&rsquo;s\na dull throbbing ache between your legs, that you got aroused by what\nyou had seen. \n</p><p>\nYou&rsquo;re just lucky Crowley wasn&rsquo;t next to you because you know he\nwould&rsquo;ve heard your panicked thoughts just now. He didn&rsquo;t need to\nknow how much you were being tormented by this.</p><p><i>Did\nyou enjoy that? Oh you did, you bad baaaaad girl. Come see what&rsquo;s\nkickin&rsquo; in the throne room, Tabby. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll love it.</i></p><p>\nYou hastily scramble, pulling on jeans and a t-shirt before rushing\nout to the throne room, past several demons who give excited\nwhispers. You throw open the double doors to see Crowley on the floor\nand Lucifer on the throne, one leg crooked over the arm rest.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hi cupcake,&rdquo; he smiles sweetly at you. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabitha, get out!&rdquo; Crowley roars through his pain.</p><p>\nLucifer flicks his wrist and you hear an audible crack as Crowley&rsquo;s\nback seems to bend unnaturally far backwards.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; you yell, running forward to grab him, to protect him.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Hmmm, nah,&rdquo; Lucifer shrugs. &ldquo;He was mean to me. I don&rsquo;t like\nmean people. Hey, here&rsquo;s a neat idea. I&rsquo;ll tell you something that\nCrowley did that&rsquo;ll mean you don&rsquo;t like him any more.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s about my parents, I already know,&rdquo; you fire back.</p><p>\nLucifer gives a moody pout before drumming his fingers on the arm\nrests of the throne, &ldquo;Crowley, you&rsquo;re no fun. I expected you to be\nmore of a coward.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Bite me,&rdquo; Crowley growls back, gritting his teeth through the\npain.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You know, I might, so don&rsquo;t test me,&rdquo; Lucifer snarls. &ldquo;Fineeee,\nhow about this then, Crowley? I&rsquo;ve been sending sex dreams to Tabitha\nfor weeks now and she just <i>loves</i> them, don&rsquo;t you baby?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;If by love you mean I want to claw my own brain out after them\nthen yeah,&rdquo; you hiss. &ldquo;Why are you doing this to me? Why not\nshack up with Kelly?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Kelly was sweet and all but she had no fire,&rdquo; Lucifer muses.\n&ldquo;You, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re the only human female in creation\nthat&rsquo;s told me no. You&rsquo;re the only one who ever tried to understand\nme. You are the human I&rsquo;m meant to have so if Crowley could just&hellip;I\ndon&rsquo;t know&hellip;die? Gee, that would be swell.&rdquo;</p><p>\nAnother crack as Crowley&rsquo;s arm snaps in two and you&rsquo;re trying to hold\nhim as he falls sideways.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Cas!&rdquo; you shout.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s disappointing,&rdquo; Lucifer leans forward. &ldquo;My little\nbro ain&rsquo;t gonna help this. I&rsquo;ll find you. I always will. I hope\nyou&rsquo;re good at being a stepmom by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThere&rsquo;s a flap of wings behind you before you&rsquo;re deposited in the\nbunker, screaming your lungs out for the boys. There&rsquo;s a crash as\ndoors open and the running of footsteps before Sam, Dean and Mary\nburst into your bedroom. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;What the hell happened?!&rdquo; Dean says in alarm, taking in\nCrowley&rsquo;s near unconscious state. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Lucifer,&rdquo; Castiel says for you. &ldquo;Appears he came for the\nthrone of Hell. He&rsquo;s in his old vessel.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Son of a bitch,&rdquo; Dean mutters. &ldquo;Everyone okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Peachy,&rdquo; Crowley groans. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to go after Kelly,&rdquo; you tell Castiel. &ldquo;He kept\nsaying he wants me to be a stepmum to the kid. Go make sure she&rsquo;s\nfine.&rdquo;</p><p>\nThe angel disappears.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tell us what the hell is going on, Tabitha,&rdquo; Sam kneels down,\nhelping you bring Crowley onto the bed.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Crowley found Lucifer&rsquo;s essence and stuffed it into a vessel that\nwas bound with bits of the cage,&rdquo; you rattle off. &ldquo;Somehow he\nbroke out of the control. He was meant to be contained until we could\nget Kelly&rsquo;s kid but it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;How long have you known this?&rdquo; Dean asks suspiciously.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Like a month,&rdquo; you meet his gaze defiantly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tabs, we said no more secrets,&rdquo; Dean sighs long and hard.\n&ldquo;Sweetheart, you need to start trusting us more. We could&rsquo;ve\nhelped.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Trust me, you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you stand up. &ldquo;He would&rsquo;ve said\nanything to you to rile you up.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;So we need to go get to Kelly,&rdquo; Mary cuts in. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m\ntaking from this. Correct?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yes, we need to move now. I assume Cas has told you about his\nplans?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yeah but we still think he&rsquo;s nuts for it,&rdquo; Sam adds. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;I am perfectly stable,&rdquo; Castiel says as he reappears. &ldquo;Kelly\nsays&hellip;uh&hellip;well she shouted that her water has broken. I need\nassistance.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Take us all,&rdquo; you say firmly. &ldquo;I think this is going to be the\nlast stand off soon.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going anywhere without us,&rdquo; Toni says from the\ndoorway, flanked by Mick.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Do you live here now?!&rdquo; you hiss.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Trust me, I wouldn&rsquo;t choose to live somewhere this odious,&rdquo; she\ncurls her lip. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not letting a nephilim be born. It&rsquo;s\nagainst the code.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right, Tabitha,&rdquo; Mick nods. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too powerful.&rdquo;</p><p>\nToni holds up a gun whilst Mick uses a knife to slice open his palm,\ndrawing the angel banishing sigil on the wall.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare, you Brit dickbags!&rdquo; Dean yells.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Only way, mate,&rdquo; Mick shrugs apologetically.</p><p>\nBefore he can slam his hand on it, there&rsquo;s two gunshots and blood\nexplodes from their faces. They drop to the floor, bodies thudding\nheavily to reveal Ketch standing behind them.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Jesus Christ!&rdquo; you shout. &ldquo;Arthur?!&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Their termination orders had come through,&rdquo; he says quaintly,\nimperceptibly nodding at Mary.</p><p>\nYou knew that was bollocks. More likely he&rsquo;d done it before he was\nafraid for Mary&rsquo;s safety but it still shocked you. You looked away\nfrom the bodies on the floor, trying not to process it.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Castiel says, healing Crowley before gathering\neveryone in a circle once they had tooled up.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Go Team Free Will,&rdquo; Dean says grimly. &ldquo;End of days part sixty\nfive.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Everyone ready?&rdquo; Sam asks.</p><p>\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you murmur quietly. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s do this anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>\nYou give one last scared look to Crowley who returns it before you\nvanish out of the bunker.</p><p>_____&nbsp;</p><p>Taglist:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md64gLI9X1tHrV7E-f91z9w\">@samael-has-arrived</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOoZlSTHHGBfcWJH6ua3wCQ\">@shemehaza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu9_En_EbTVpNVK0a0QQ2mw\">@blueboolu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIqJDwp21syOZ6QnVrKIGOw\">@astridstark13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJkaWEeXj9PiJBBZ4NVr5pg\">@oldsoulevy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <strike>@wolfygecko</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_LK6GlOtQQcl2UWq0WM-g\">@fairytale07</a></p></p>",
