It\u2019s kind of shamelessly fluff and a high school musical reference but oh well! i hope people have fun! <br/></small></p><p><small>Snow blustered by the window, and Momo watched her gentle breath fog \nup the glass. She shivered, though it was warm in the car. She could \nalready imagine the sharp breeze nipping at her cheeks, her nose tinged \nred as she swooped through the powdery snow with her skis.</small></p><p><small>She \ndaydreamed about her family\u2019s yearly trip for weeks before. Sitting in \nclass, her mind would often drift to the slopes. She could almost feel \nthe wind brushing through her dark locks, the white powder covering her \nlegs as she zipped down the mountain with her parents.</small></p><!-- more --><p>Pressing \nher finger against the fogged up glass, she doodled a picture of a \nmountain on the window, a small smile pulling across her lips.</p><p>The yearly trip would be a nice reprieve from her frustrating, anxious thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo,\n darling, don&rsquo;t smudge your finger against the window. It leaves \nprints!&rdquo; her mother chided, glancing to the backseat. &ldquo;Take a nap if \nyou&rsquo;re tired. We still have at least another hour left in the car.&rdquo;</p><p>Momo\n jolted, sitting up straight. &ldquo;Yes, Mother, I apologize,&rdquo; she said, \nbowing her head. Her cheeks heated up. She wasn&rsquo;t a child anymore, her \nmother shouldn&rsquo;t have to scold her over something so petty.</p><p>She \ntook a deep breath, leaning her head back against the side of the door. \nFor as long as Momo could remember, her family took a two week trip to \nthe mountains for her winter break. They spent the two weeks skiing, ice\n skating, and relaxing in the hot tub. It was Momo&rsquo;s favorite time of \nyear.</p><p>Her parents spent the majority of their time working, and \neven free time often turned into extra work, leaving them very little \ntime with their daughter. But on their yearly ski trip, most of the time\n belonged to her.</p><p>As a child, there was one year her parents \npawned her off on a ski instructor, but after a few days of learning \nvarious techniques, Momo was proud to be able to keep up with her \nparents. Even as a child, she was focused and intelligent.</p><p>&ldquo;Is your friend going to be here this year?&rdquo; her mother asked, pulling Momo from her thoughts.</p><p>When\n she grew older, there were some times her parents wished to spend \nalone, which Momo could understand. They both worked so much they barely\n had time for each other as well. And so Momo spent her free time at the\n lodge cafe or recreational center, which was how she met one of her \ngreatest friends, Jirou Kyouka.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! I forgot to text her this morning!&rdquo; Momo said, pulling out her phone.</p><p>[Kyouka: 4 New Messages]</p><p>A small giggle left Momo&rsquo;s lips. It was no surprise Kyouka was already texting her.</p><p>Kyouka&rsquo;s\n parents were the clingy type. Both well-known musicians, their winter \ntrip was time for family bonding, and Kyouka often begged to escape to \nspend time with Momo.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, when are you getting here? I&rsquo;m already dying.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: My Dad is suggesting our families all karaoke tonight. I only have so many ways to say no.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: I really hope you&rsquo;re at least on your way.</p><p>[Text\n from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, seriously! Where are you?! This boy just talked \nto me and I swear, I can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s cute or an idiot.</p><p>Momo \ncouldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at the last text. Momo had to admit, the few \ntimes Kyouka was vocal about her various attractions, Momo found herself\n questioning Kyouka&rsquo;s taste, mostly in men.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Don&rsquo;t worry, don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;re almost there! Sorry I didn&rsquo;t text back, I was a little distracted.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Why does your family do everything in slow motion?</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: I apologize, Kyouka! We are really close! Mother said we&rsquo;re about an hour away!</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: AN HOUR!? &hellip;Killing me slowly&hellip;</p><p>She\n smiled, brushing her thumb over the screen. Her heart throbbed with \nanticipation. She and Kyouka only saw each other a few times a year; \nalways on their two week family trips, and occasionally during summer \nbreak for a mid-year sleepover.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Why don&rsquo;t you tell me more about this boy?</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Ugh. Just get here. He works at the cafe, you&rsquo;ll meet him.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: If you&rsquo;re really bored, you could tell me now.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Nope. This is your punishment for being so damn late!</p><p>&ldquo;I take it you two are making plans already?&rdquo; Her mother&rsquo;s voice made Momo jump, clutching her phone to her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes! Kyouka is&hellip; very eager for our arrival,&rdquo; Momo giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;That\n makes two of us,&rdquo; the woman sighed. Momo&rsquo;s mother never did well when \nthey traveled in the snow. It was part of the reason they had such a \nlate start; her mother secretly wanted to wait until the snow passed, \nhoping they wouldn&rsquo;t have to drive through the light storm.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there, darling,&rdquo; her father reassured, and Momo turned her gaze back towards the window.</p><p>The\n snow wasn&rsquo;t falling very fast. It was light and gentle, though it \nseemed to be sticking to the ground. It was Momo&rsquo;s favorite kind of a \nweather; cold, but with a purpose, the ground snuggling in its blanket \nof white.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh, not wanting her parents to \nhear. As excited as she was for the trip, she hated the idea of it \ncoming to an end. And as usual, Momo knew the time would pass incredibly\n fast, which meant returning to school for the last time in the spring.</p><p>A\n lump formed in her throat as she thought about leaving school. Of \ncourse university loomed on the horizon, so it wasn&rsquo;t as if she would be\n free from studying (not that she wanted to be). But the idea of \nactually furthering her studies, taking her one step closer to \nadulthood, terrified her. Momo had no clue what she planned on doing \nwith her life, and university was a strong reminder of her unknown \nfuture.</p><p>This most likely wouldn&rsquo;t be her last ski trip, but for some reason, she kept feeling like after high school things would <i>feel</i> different.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\n here,&rdquo; her father said, and Momo immediately pressed her cheek against \nthe window, staring at the giant lodge in front of her.</p><p>It never \nseemed to change. The large wooden building which stood at the base of \nthe mountains was four stories tall, balconies decorated by fairy \nlights. Large stone chimneys pressed against the side of the various \nlodges, and Momo could already picture the fire burning in the pits of \nthe lobbies. Behind the lit up building, ski slopes cut through the \nmountain, separated by long strips of green trees. Various chair lifts \nand gondolas strung up the mountain, still running even later in the \nafternoon. After dark, a few trails were lit up for night skiing. For \nnow, Momo saw a few small figures zooming back and forth across the \nslopes.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be nice to get out there tomorrow.&rdquo; Her father sighed happily.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, anything to be out of this car,&rdquo; her mother said, gently touching his leg. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get checked in.&rdquo;</p><p>They\n pulled into a parking spot, and Momo stared at the lodge, completely \nlit up in front of her. The roof was dusted by snow and the sun shone, \nmaking the white power glisten with sparkles. Opening the door, Momo was\n hit by a cold breeze, but her heart felt warm, as if she was home.</p><p>Next\n to her, another car door slammed shut and Momo glanced to her side. \nStruggling to hold four different bags, a boy her age with perfectly \nsymmetrical red and white hair stared at her for a moment. His eyes were\n two different colors, and they absolutely fascinated her. He also had a\n scar over his left eye, and Momo flushed, realizing her staring at his \neyes might have been mistaken for focusing on the scar.</p><p>Really, he was quite handsome. Momo had never found herself drawn to someone so fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouto! Hurry up!&rdquo; A tall, gruff looking man stormed by him, pushing the lock on the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; the boy muttered, turning away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo! Come grab your bags.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A-Ah! Right!&rdquo; Her father&rsquo;s voice pulled her out of her daze, and she dashed around to the back of the car, grabbed her bags.</p><p>She\n glanced behind her, watching the boy walk away. It wasn&rsquo;t unusual to \nsee new people here every year; it was a popular resort, and expensive, \nso some people made it a special, one-time only trip. However, Momo \ncouldn&rsquo;t help but follow him as he walked away, wondering if she would \nsee him again during her stay.</p><p>~~</p><p>Shouto hated car rides, \nespecially long ones with his family. They were usually deadly silent, \nor consisted of Natsuo loudly (and obnoxiously) singing along with \nwhatever was on his iPod. Fuyumi would attempt to quiet him down, but \neventually it would take their father&rsquo;s loud, frustrated voice to get \nhim to stop.</p><p>Then it would be completely and utterly silent. So \nmuch so, Shouto could hear his own breath, as well as the soft breaths \nof his siblings, all of them desperate to expel the tension hanging \nabove the car.</p><p>Currently, they were past the point of awkward \nsilence, and Natsuo finally started talking again. Unfortunately, his \nattention fell on Shouto. &ldquo;Do you even remember how to ski, Shouto? Mom \ntaught you when you were so little.&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto&rsquo;s chest tightened at the mention of his mother. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he muttered, turning his eyes towards the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Hah?\n Shouto!&rdquo; Natsuo whined and poked at his cheek. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;I \nknow&rsquo;? Do you 'know&rsquo; how to ski still? Or are you just saying you 'know&rsquo;\n Mom taught you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave him alone Natsuo&hellip;&rdquo; Fuyumi tried again, \nturning around from the front seat, and gently placed her palm on his \nforearm, pressing against it.</p><p>Shouto couldn&rsquo;t help but be jealous \nToya got out of this trip simply because he was currently studying \nabroad and decided not to return home for winter break. If Shouto could \nleave and never come back, he would&rsquo;ve gladly chosen that option.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Shouto said finally.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Well good then! I didn&rsquo;t want to have to teach you again!&rdquo; Natsuo chuckled. There was no response.</p><p>Finally\n realizing he wasn&rsquo;t going to garner the response he wished for from \neither Shouto or Fuyumi, Natsuo lay his head back against the window and\n shut his eyes.</p><p>Relieved, a breath of cold air slipped from \nShouto&rsquo;s lips. His father just happened to have the body temperature \nfrom hell, and he rarely remembered to put the heat on. There was no way\n Shouto was going to ask the man for anything either.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re \nalmost there,&rdquo; Enji&rsquo;s gruff voice echoed from the front, causing all of \nthe siblings to jump. &ldquo;So you can all give it a rest.&rdquo;</p><p>This whole \ntrip was a bit baffling to Shouto. Before, their winter trips usually \nhappened thanks to their mother, and she was certainly not going to be \nthere this time. Enji always acted as though the ski trips were the \nbiggest burden on him. He didn&rsquo;t even seem to enjoy skiing, though he \noften bragged he was the best at it. He could&rsquo;ve gone pro if he wanted \nor&hellip; something&hellip; Shouto usually tried to tune him out when he got to \nthat point.</p><p>And yet, even without his mother, somehow they were \nall on their way up to the mountains. Though Enji chose a new resort \nthis time, one Shouto and his siblings were unfamiliar with. None of \nthem complained though; Shouto wasn&rsquo;t sure if any of them wanted to be \nhere without their mother.</p><p>Shouto kept his eyes locked on the \nsnowflakes swirling outside his window. His mother always did adore the \nsnow. When the first flakes began to fall from the sky, she would rush \nto the window, her gray eyes illuminated with excitement.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s \nsnowing!&rdquo; she would call out, like a young child awake far too early on \nChristmas morning. &ldquo;Come here, Shouto.&rdquo; Her small hands would cup at his\n sides, and she would lift his tiny body up to the window. &ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; she \nsaid, smiling, &ldquo;the world will be covered in a frozen white blanket. And\n we&rsquo;ll be nice and warm inside. But maybe&hellip; we can go out and play \nlater.&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto&rsquo;s eyes twinkled then, his hands curling around the \nsill. His heart was always full of wonder for their snowy yard. His \nmother made it sound ethereal; a winter wonderland of adventures waiting\n for just the two of them beyond the glass of the window.</p><p>Things \nwere different now. His breath, though cold, still fogged up the glass \nwindow of the car. The world a dull gray as it breezed past them on the \nhighway.</p><p>Soon&hellip; soon he would be free from this car, and not long\n after this trip he would be free forever from his father. He could live\n in the dorms at his university and as far as Shouto was concerned, the \nfurther away from that man he was, the better.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we going to be\n skiing all week, Father?&rdquo; Fuyumi asked. &ldquo;I was hoping maybe we could \ntake a day for cross-country? Or ice skating&hellip;&rdquo; His sister trailed off,\n the words left unspoken.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>&ldquo;Because Mother also enjoyed doing those things too.&rdquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Do whatever you want during your downtime,&rdquo; Enji said. &ldquo;You will\n be skiing at the designated times. I already paid for the tickets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n see,&rdquo; Fuyumi muttered, and Shouto saw her head tilt downwards. Fuyumi \nand their mother often spent a day together ice skating. Of all the \nwinter activities, it was Fuyumi&rsquo;s favorite, and one she excelled at.</p><p>Shouto\n didn&rsquo;t love ice skating, but he had a feeling Natsuo would force Shouto\n to go with the two of them at one point on this trip. He supposed for \nFuyumi, he could stomach it. In fact, doing various activities with his \nbrother and sister would probably be far more fulfilling than anything \ntheir father planned.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Natsuo cheered, pressing his \nface flat against the window. Sometimes Shouto seriously couldn&rsquo;t \nbelieve Natsuo was older than him. &ldquo;Look at this place! It&rsquo;s huge!&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto\n leaned towards the middle of the car, catching a glimpse at the large \nfour story lodge. His nose wrinkled. His mother would&rsquo;ve hated this \nplace. She much preferred smaller cabins, a more homey feel, than&hellip; \ncommercialized lodges.</p><p>Then again, nothing about this trip was \ngoing to feel homey at all, so Shouto supposed this ginormous lodge was \nmore than appropriate.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouto, get my bags while I take down the skis,&rdquo; Enji said, putting the car in park.</p><p>It\n was always him. No surprise there. Shouto didn&rsquo;t answer and instead \nstepped out of the car, his boots squishing against the dirty, slushy \nsnow beneath his feet.</p><p>He made his way to the back of the car and \nlifted up the trunk, pulling his own bag and the various bags Enji \npacked. Why his father needed more than one bag was beyond Shouto, but \nhe didn&rsquo;t feel like listening to the man scold him if he didn&rsquo;t grab \nall&hellip; three of them. He sighed, slinging one over his shoulder, holding\n one on his wrist and the other two in his hand.</p><p>He used his elbow\n to slam the trunk shut and stumbled backwards, clutching two of the \nbags close to his chest as he tried not to fall. It was then, when he \nwas making a complete and utter fool of himself, that he caught eyes \nwith a girl.</p><p>She was probably about his age, and she was, well, \nstunning. He probably looked like a fool staring right at her, but her \nsharp dark eyes drew him in. Her pale cheeks were a bit flushed, \nprobably reddened from the kiss of the cool air. Her dark black hair was\n in a ponytail which fanned out against the back of her head, and red, \nfluffy ear muffs covered her ears.</p><p>Their eyes met and she stared \nright back, her lips pulling into a curious circle. Shouto could \nhonestly say he had never seen anyone quite as beautiful as her.</p><p>How lame.</p><p>He\n opened his mouth as if to speak, but he had no idea what he would even \nsay to a girl like her. 'Hello&rsquo; probably would&rsquo;ve been a good start. His\n throat felt dry, frozen in the cold air. What <i>were</i> words anyway?</p><p>&ldquo;Shouto!\n Hurry up!&rdquo; Enji&rsquo;s voice cut through his daydream, shattering it onto \nthe ground. Shouto was thankful he didn&rsquo;t drop the damn bags.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo;\n he muttered, reluctantly turning away from her. It was silly to regret \nit; it wasn&rsquo;t as if Shouto had anything to say to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo! Come grab your bags.&rdquo; He heard a voice call from behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;A-Ah! Right!&rdquo;</p><p>He\n was tempted to look back, curious to see her one more time, but he \nsupposed he might see her during the trip anyway. The lodge was huge, so\n the probability was low. But Shouto felt a little lighter as he carried\n the bags. The thought of seeing her again made his heart beat just a \nlittle faster.</p><p>Maybe he would survive this trip after all.</p>",

She could almost feel \nthe wind brushing through her dark locks, the white powder covering her \nlegs as she zipped down the mountain with her parents.</small></p>[[MORE]]<p>Pressing \nher finger against the fogged up glass, she doodled a picture of a \nmountain on the window, a small smile pulling across her lips.</p><p>The yearly trip would be a nice reprieve from her frustrating, anxious thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMomo,\n darling, don\u2019t smudge your finger against the window. It leaves \nprints!\u201d her mother chided, glancing to the backseat. \u201cTake a nap if \nyou\u2019re tired. We still have at least another hour left in the car.\u201d</p><p>Momo\n jolted, sitting up straight. \u201cYes, Mother, I apologize,\u201d she said, \nbowing her head. Her cheeks heated up. She wasn\u2019t a child anymore, her \nmother shouldn\u2019t have to scold her over something so petty.</p><p>She \ntook a deep breath, leaning her head back against the side of the door. \nFor as long as Momo could remember, her family took a two week trip to \nthe mountains for her winter break. They spent the two weeks skiing, ice\n skating, and relaxing in the hot tub. It was Momo\u2019s favorite time of \nyear.</p><p>Her parents spent the majority of their time working, and \neven free time often turned into extra work, leaving them very little \ntime with their daughter. But on their yearly ski trip, most of the time\n belonged to her.</p><p>As a child, there was one year her parents \npawned her off on a ski instructor, but after a few days of learning \nvarious techniques, Momo was proud to be able to keep up with her \nparents. Even as a child, she was focused and intelligent.</p><p>\u201cIs your friend going to be here this year?\u201d her mother asked, pulling Momo from her thoughts.</p><p>When\n she grew older, there were some times her parents wished to spend \nalone, which Momo could understand. They both worked so much they barely\n had time for each other as well. And so Momo spent her free time at the\n lodge cafe or recreational center, which was how she met one of her \ngreatest friends, Jirou Kyouka.</p><p>\u201cAh! I forgot to text her this morning!\u201d Momo said, pulling out her phone.</p><p>[Kyouka: 4 New Messages]</p><p>A small giggle left Momo\u2019s lips. It was no surprise Kyouka was already texting her.</p><p>Kyouka\u2019s\n parents were the clingy type. Both well-known musicians, their winter \ntrip was time for family bonding, and Kyouka often begged to escape to \nspend time with Momo.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, when are you getting here? I\u2019m already dying.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: My Dad is suggesting our families all karaoke tonight. I only have so many ways to say no.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: I really hope you\u2019re at least on your way.</p><p>[Text\n from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, seriously! Where are you?! This boy just talked \nto me and I swear, I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s cute or an idiot.</p><p>Momo \ncouldn\u2019t help but laugh at the last text. Momo had to admit, the few \ntimes Kyouka was vocal about her various attractions, Momo found herself\n questioning Kyouka\u2019s taste, mostly in men.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re almost there! Sorry I didn\u2019t text back, I was a little distracted.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Why does your family do everything in slow motion?</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: I apologize, Kyouka! We are really close! Mother said we\u2019re about an hour away!</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: AN HOUR!? \u2026Killing me slowly\u2026</p><p>She\n smiled, brushing her thumb over the screen. Her heart throbbed with \nanticipation. She and Kyouka only saw each other a few times a year; \nalways on their two week family trips, and occasionally during summer \nbreak for a mid-year sleepover.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Why don\u2019t you tell me more about this boy?</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Ugh. Just get here. He works at the cafe, you\u2019ll meet him.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: If you\u2019re really bored, you could tell me now.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Nope. This is your punishment for being so damn late!</p><p>\u201cI take it you two are making plans already?\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice made Momo jump, clutching her phone to her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh yes! Kyouka is\u2026 very eager for our arrival,\u201d Momo giggled.</p><p>\u201cThat\n makes two of us,\u201d the woman sighed. Momo\u2019s mother never did well when \nthey traveled in the snow. It was part of the reason they had such a \nlate start; her mother secretly wanted to wait until the snow passed, \nhoping they wouldn\u2019t have to drive through the light storm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, darling,\u201d her father reassured, and Momo turned her gaze back towards the window.</p><p>The\n snow wasn\u2019t falling very fast. It was light and gentle, though it \nseemed to be sticking to the ground. It was Momo\u2019s favorite kind of a \nweather; cold, but with a purpose, the ground snuggling in its blanket \nof white.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh, not wanting her parents to \nhear. As excited as she was for the trip, she hated the idea of it \ncoming to an end. And as usual, Momo knew the time would pass incredibly\n fast, which meant returning to school for the last time in the spring.</p><p>A\n lump formed in her throat as she thought about leaving school. Of \ncourse university loomed on the horizon, so it wasn\u2019t as if she would be\n free from studying (not that she wanted to be). But the idea of \nactually furthering her studies, taking her one step closer to \nadulthood, terrified her. Momo had no clue what she planned on doing \nwith her life, and university was a strong reminder of her unknown \nfuture.</p><p>This most likely wouldn\u2019t be her last ski trip, but for some reason, she kept feeling like after high school things would <i>feel</i> different.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\n here,\u201d her father said, and Momo immediately pressed her cheek against \nthe window, staring at the giant lodge in front of her.</p><p>It never \nseemed to change. The large wooden building which stood at the base of \nthe mountains was four stories tall, balconies decorated by fairy \nlights. Large stone chimneys pressed against the side of the various \nlodges, and Momo could already picture the fire burning in the pits of \nthe lobbies. Behind the lit up building, ski slopes cut through the \nmountain, separated by long strips of green trees. Various chair lifts \nand gondolas strung up the mountain, still running even later in the \nafternoon. After dark, a few trails were lit up for night skiing. For \nnow, Momo saw a few small figures zooming back and forth across the \nslopes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to get out there tomorrow.\u201d Her father sighed happily.</p><p>\u201cYes, anything to be out of this car,\u201d her mother said, gently touching his leg. \u201cLet\u2019s get checked in.\u201d</p><p>They\n pulled into a parking spot, and Momo stared at the lodge, completely \nlit up in front of her. The roof was dusted by snow and the sun shone, \nmaking the white power glisten with sparkles. Opening the door, Momo was\n hit by a cold breeze, but her heart felt warm, as if she was home.</p><p>Next\n to her, another car door slammed shut and Momo glanced to her side. \nStruggling to hold four different bags, a boy her age with perfectly \nsymmetrical red and white hair stared at her for a moment. His eyes were\n two different colors, and they absolutely fascinated her. He also had a\n scar over his left eye, and Momo flushed, realizing her staring at his \neyes might have been mistaken for focusing on the scar.</p><p>Really, he was quite handsome. Momo had never found herself drawn to someone so fast.</p><p>\u201cShouto! Hurry up!\u201d A tall, gruff looking man stormed by him, pushing the lock on the car.</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d the boy muttered, turning away from her.</p><p>\u201cMomo! Come grab your bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Ah! Right!\u201d Her father\u2019s voice pulled her out of her daze, and she dashed around to the back of the car, grabbed her bags.</p><p>She\n glanced behind her, watching the boy walk away. It wasn\u2019t unusual to \nsee new people here every year; it was a popular resort, and expensive, \nso some people made it a special, one-time only trip. However, Momo \ncouldn\u2019t help but follow him as he walked away, wondering if she would \nsee him again during her stay.</p><p>~~</p><p>Shouto hated car rides, \nespecially long ones with his family. They were usually deadly silent, \nor consisted of Natsuo loudly (and obnoxiously) singing along with \nwhatever was on his iPod. Fuyumi would attempt to quiet him down, but \neventually it would take their father\u2019s loud, frustrated voice to get \nhim to stop.</p><p>Then it would be completely and utterly silent. So \nmuch so, Shouto could hear his own breath, as well as the soft breaths \nof his siblings, all of them desperate to expel the tension hanging \nabove the car.</p><p>Currently, they were past the point of awkward \nsilence, and Natsuo finally started talking again. Unfortunately, his \nattention fell on Shouto. \u201cDo you even remember how to ski, Shouto? Mom \ntaught you when you were so little.\u201d</p><p>Shouto\u2019s chest tightened at the mention of his mother. \u201cI know,\u201d he muttered, turning his eyes towards the window.</p><p>\u201cHah?\n Shouto!\u201d Natsuo whined and poked at his cheek. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018I \nknow\u2019? Do you 'know\u2019 how to ski still? Or are you just saying you 'know\u2019\n Mom taught you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone Natsuo\u2026\u201d Fuyumi tried again, \nturning around from the front seat, and gently placed her palm on his \nforearm, pressing against it.</p><p>Shouto couldn\u2019t help but be jealous \nToya got out of this trip simply because he was currently studying \nabroad and decided not to return home for winter break.

I didn\u2019t want to have to teach you again!\u201d Natsuo chuckled. There was no response.</p><p>Finally\n realizing he wasn\u2019t going to garner the response he wished for from \neither Shouto or Fuyumi, Natsuo lay his head back against the window and\n shut his eyes.</p><p>Relieved, a breath of cold air slipped from \nShouto\u2019s lips.

Of all the \nwinter activities, it was Fuyumi\u2019s favorite, and one she excelled at.</p><p>Shouto\n didn\u2019t love ice skating, but he had a feeling Natsuo would force Shouto\n to go with the two of them at one point on this trip. He supposed for \nFuyumi, he could stomach it. In fact, doing various activities with his \nbrother and sister would probably be far more fulfilling than anything \ntheir father planned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Natsuo cheered, pressing his \nface flat against the window. Sometimes Shouto seriously couldn\u2019t \nbelieve Natsuo was older than him. \u201cLook at this place! It\u2019s huge!\u201d</p><p>Shouto\n leaned towards the middle of the car, catching a glimpse at the large \nfour story lodge. His nose wrinkled. His mother would\u2019ve hated this \nplace. She much preferred smaller cabins, a more homey feel, than\u2026 \ncommercialized lodges.</p><p>Then again, nothing about this trip was \ngoing to feel homey at all, so Shouto supposed this ginormous lodge was \nmore than appropriate.</p><p>\u201cShouto, get my bags while I take down the skis,\u201d Enji said, putting the car in park.</p><p>It\n was always him. No surprise there. Shouto didn\u2019t answer and instead \nstepped out of the car, his boots squishing against the dirty, slushy \nsnow beneath his feet.</p><p>He made his way to the back of the car and \nlifted up the trunk, pulling his own bag and the various bags Enji \npacked. Why his father needed more than one bag was beyond Shouto, but \nhe didn\u2019t feel like listening to the man scold him if he didn\u2019t grab \nall\u2026 three of them. He sighed, slinging one over his shoulder, holding\n one on his wrist and the other two in his hand.</p><p>He used his elbow\n to slam the trunk shut and stumbled backwards, clutching two of the \nbags close to his chest as he tried not to fall. It was then, when he \nwas making a complete and utter fool of himself, that he caught eyes \nwith a girl.</p><p>She was probably about his age, and she was, well, \nstunning. He probably looked like a fool staring right at her, but her \nsharp dark eyes drew him in. Her pale cheeks were a bit flushed, \nprobably reddened from the kiss of the cool air. Her dark black hair was\n in a ponytail which fanned out against the back of her head, and red, \nfluffy ear muffs covered her ears.</p><p>Their eyes met and she stared \nright back, her lips pulling into a curious circle. Shouto could \nhonestly say he had never seen anyone quite as beautiful as her.</p><p>How lame.</p><p>He\n opened his mouth as if to speak, but he had no idea what he would even \nsay to a girl like her. 'Hello\u2019 probably would\u2019ve been a good start. His\n throat felt dry, frozen in the cold air. What <i>were</i> words anyway?</p><p>\u201cShouto!\n Hurry up!\u201d Enji\u2019s voice cut through his daydream, shattering it onto \nthe ground. Shouto was thankful he didn\u2019t drop the damn bags.</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d\n he muttered, reluctantly turning away from her. It was silly to regret \nit; it wasn\u2019t as if Shouto had anything to say to her.</p><p>\u201cMomo! Come grab your bags.\u201d He heard a voice call from behind him.</p><p>\u201cA-Ah! Right!\u201d</p><p>He\n was tempted to look back, curious to see her one more time, but he \nsupposed he might see her during the trip anyway. The lodge was huge, so\n the probability was low. But Shouto felt a little lighter as he carried\n the bags. The thought of seeing her again made his heart beat just a \nlittle faster.</p><p>Maybe he would survive this trip after all.</p>",

Even though she\u2019s anxious about graduating in the \nspring, she\u2019ll have time to relax, enjoy the slopes and hang out with \nher best friend.<br>Shouto is not thrilled to be stuck with his \nfather for the entirety of his winter break. It\u2019s anything but a \nvacation. Even with his siblings there, everything reminds him of his \npast and he just wants to get back to finishing school and moving on.<br>When\n the two continuously run into each other at the lodge, both of them \nrealize their vacations aren\u2019t going to be what either of them expected.<br><br><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16851022/chapters/39562528\">Read on AO3</a><br><br>Ayyy I\u2019m finally writing a Todomomo focused fic! <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> read it ahead of time and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9ysr5edI-nms-d5tWgHGBw\">@lainaraquel</a> was so supportive of this fic and my ideas for it! It\u2019s kind of shamelessly fluff and a high school musical reference but oh well! i hope people have fun! <br></small></p><p><small>Snow blustered by the window, and Momo watched her gentle breath fog \nup the glass. She shivered, though it was warm in the car. She could \nalready imagine the sharp breeze nipping at her cheeks, her nose tinged \nred as she swooped through the powdery snow with her skis.</small></p><p><small>She \ndaydreamed about her family\u2019s yearly trip for weeks before. Sitting in \nclass, her mind would often drift to the slopes. She could almost feel \nthe wind brushing through her dark locks, the white powder covering her \nlegs as she zipped down the mountain with her parents.</small></p>[[MORE]]<p>Pressing \nher finger against the fogged up glass, she doodled a picture of a \nmountain on the window, a small smile pulling across her lips.</p><p>The yearly trip would be a nice reprieve from her frustrating, anxious thoughts.</p><p>\u201cMomo,\n darling, don\u2019t smudge your finger against the window. It leaves \nprints!\u201d her mother chided, glancing to the backseat. \u201cTake a nap if \nyou\u2019re tired. We still have at least another hour left in the car.\u201d</p><p>Momo\n jolted, sitting up straight. \u201cYes, Mother, I apologize,\u201d she said, \nbowing her head. Her cheeks heated up. She wasn\u2019t a child anymore, her \nmother shouldn\u2019t have to scold her over something so petty.</p><p>She \ntook a deep breath, leaning her head back against the side of the door. \nFor as long as Momo could remember, her family took a two week trip to \nthe mountains for her winter break. They spent the two weeks skiing, ice\n skating, and relaxing in the hot tub. It was Momo\u2019s favorite time of \nyear.</p><p>Her parents spent the majority of their time working, and \neven free time often turned into extra work, leaving them very little \ntime with their daughter. But on their yearly ski trip, most of the time\n belonged to her.</p><p>As a child, there was one year her parents \npawned her off on a ski instructor, but after a few days of learning \nvarious techniques, Momo was proud to be able to keep up with her \nparents. Even as a child, she was focused and intelligent.</p><p>\u201cIs your friend going to be here this year?\u201d her mother asked, pulling Momo from her thoughts.</p><p>When\n she grew older, there were some times her parents wished to spend \nalone, which Momo could understand. They both worked so much they barely\n had time for each other as well. And so Momo spent her free time at the\n lodge cafe or recreational center, which was how she met one of her \ngreatest friends, Jirou Kyouka.</p><p>\u201cAh! I forgot to text her this morning!\u201d Momo said, pulling out her phone.</p><p>[Kyouka: 4 New Messages]</p><p>A small giggle left Momo\u2019s lips. It was no surprise Kyouka was already texting her.</p><p>Kyouka\u2019s\n parents were the clingy type. Both well-known musicians, their winter \ntrip was time for family bonding, and Kyouka often begged to escape to \nspend time with Momo.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, when are you getting here? I\u2019m already dying.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: My Dad is suggesting our families all karaoke tonight. I only have so many ways to say no.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: I really hope you\u2019re at least on your way.</p><p>[Text\n from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, seriously! Where are you?! This boy just talked \nto me and I swear, I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s cute or an idiot.</p><p>Momo \ncouldn\u2019t help but laugh at the last text. Momo had to admit, the few \ntimes Kyouka was vocal about her various attractions, Momo found herself\n questioning Kyouka\u2019s taste, mostly in men.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re almost there! Sorry I didn\u2019t text back, I was a little distracted.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Why does your family do everything in slow motion?</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: I apologize, Kyouka! We are really close! Mother said we\u2019re about an hour away!</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: AN HOUR!? \u2026Killing me slowly\u2026</p><p>She\n smiled, brushing her thumb over the screen. Her heart throbbed with \nanticipation. She and Kyouka only saw each other a few times a year; \nalways on their two week family trips, and occasionally during summer \nbreak for a mid-year sleepover.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Why don\u2019t you tell me more about this boy?</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Ugh. Just get here. He works at the cafe, you\u2019ll meet him.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: If you\u2019re really bored, you could tell me now.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Nope. This is your punishment for being so damn late!</p><p>\u201cI take it you two are making plans already?\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice made Momo jump, clutching her phone to her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh yes! Kyouka is\u2026 very eager for our arrival,\u201d Momo giggled.</p><p>\u201cThat\n makes two of us,\u201d the woman sighed. Momo\u2019s mother never did well when \nthey traveled in the snow. It was part of the reason they had such a \nlate start; her mother secretly wanted to wait until the snow passed, \nhoping they wouldn\u2019t have to drive through the light storm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, darling,\u201d her father reassured, and Momo turned her gaze back towards the window.</p><p>The\n snow wasn\u2019t falling very fast. It was light and gentle, though it \nseemed to be sticking to the ground. It was Momo\u2019s favorite kind of a \nweather; cold, but with a purpose, the ground snuggling in its blanket \nof white.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh, not wanting her parents to \nhear. As excited as she was for the trip, she hated the idea of it \ncoming to an end. And as usual, Momo knew the time would pass incredibly\n fast, which meant returning to school for the last time in the spring.</p><p>A\n lump formed in her throat as she thought about leaving school. Of \ncourse university loomed on the horizon, so it wasn\u2019t as if she would be\n free from studying (not that she wanted to be). But the idea of \nactually furthering her studies, taking her one step closer to \nadulthood, terrified her. Momo had no clue what she planned on doing \nwith her life, and university was a strong reminder of her unknown \nfuture.</p><p>This most likely wouldn\u2019t be her last ski trip, but for some reason, she kept feeling like after high school things would <i>feel</i> different.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\n here,\u201d her father said, and Momo immediately pressed her cheek against \nthe window, staring at the giant lodge in front of her.</p><p>It never \nseemed to change. The large wooden building which stood at the base of \nthe mountains was four stories tall, balconies decorated by fairy \nlights. Large stone chimneys pressed against the side of the various \nlodges, and Momo could already picture the fire burning in the pits of \nthe lobbies. Behind the lit up building, ski slopes cut through the \nmountain, separated by long strips of green trees. Various chair lifts \nand gondolas strung up the mountain, still running even later in the \nafternoon. After dark, a few trails were lit up for night skiing. For \nnow, Momo saw a few small figures zooming back and forth across the \nslopes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to get out there tomorrow.\u201d Her father sighed happily.</p><p>\u201cYes, anything to be out of this car,\u201d her mother said, gently touching his leg. \u201cLet\u2019s get checked in.\u201d</p><p>They\n pulled into a parking spot, and Momo stared at the lodge, completely \nlit up in front of her. The roof was dusted by snow and the sun shone, \nmaking the white power glisten with sparkles. Opening the door, Momo was\n hit by a cold breeze, but her heart felt warm, as if she was home.</p><p>Next\n to her, another car door slammed shut and Momo glanced to her side. \nStruggling to hold four different bags, a boy her age with perfectly \nsymmetrical red and white hair stared at her for a moment. His eyes were\n two different colors, and they absolutely fascinated her. He also had a\n scar over his left eye, and Momo flushed, realizing her staring at his \neyes might have been mistaken for focusing on the scar.</p><p>Really, he was quite handsome. Momo had never found herself drawn to someone so fast.</p><p>\u201cShouto! Hurry up!\u201d A tall, gruff looking man stormed by him, pushing the lock on the car.</p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d the boy muttered, turning away from her.</p><p>\u201cMomo! Come grab your bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Ah! Right!\u201d Her father\u2019s voice pulled her out of her daze, and she dashed around to the back of the car, grabbed her bags.</p><p>She\n glanced behind her, watching the boy walk away. It wasn\u2019t unusual to \nsee new people here every year; it was a popular resort, and expensive, \nso some people made it a special, one-time only trip. However, Momo \ncouldn\u2019t help but follow him as he walked away, wondering if she would \nsee him again during her stay.</p><p>~~</p><p>Shouto hated car rides, \nespecially long ones with his family. They were usually deadly silent, \nor consisted of Natsuo loudly (and obnoxiously) singing along with \nwhatever was on his iPod. Fuyumi would attempt to quiet him down, but \neventually it would take their father\u2019s loud, frustrated voice to get \nhim to stop.</p><p>Then it would be completely and utterly silent. So \nmuch so, Shouto could hear his own breath, as well as the soft breaths \nof his siblings, all of them desperate to expel the tension hanging \nabove the car.</p><p>Currently, they were past the point of awkward \nsilence, and Natsuo finally started talking again. Unfortunately, his \nattention fell on Shouto. \u201cDo you even remember how to ski, Shouto? Mom \ntaught you when you were so little.\u201d</p><p>Shouto\u2019s chest tightened at the mention of his mother. \u201cI know,\u201d he muttered, turning his eyes towards the window.</p><p>\u201cHah?\n Shouto!\u201d Natsuo whined and poked at his cheek. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018I \nknow\u2019? Do you 'know\u2019 how to ski still? Or are you just saying you 'know\u2019\n Mom taught you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone Natsuo\u2026\u201d Fuyumi tried again, \nturning around from the front seat, and gently placed her palm on his \nforearm, pressing against it.</p><p>Shouto couldn\u2019t help but be jealous \nToya got out of this trip simply because he was currently studying \nabroad and decided not to return home for winter break. If Shouto could \nleave and never come back, he would\u2019ve gladly chosen that option.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Shouto said finally.</p><p>\u201cOh! Well good then! I didn\u2019t want to have to teach you again!\u201d Natsuo chuckled. There was no response.</p><p>Finally\n realizing he wasn\u2019t going to garner the response he wished for from \neither Shouto or Fuyumi, Natsuo lay his head back against the window and\n shut his eyes.</p><p>Relieved, a breath of cold air slipped from \nShouto\u2019s lips. His father just happened to have the body temperature \nfrom hell, and he rarely remembered to put the heat on. There was no way\n Shouto was going to ask the man for anything either.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re \nalmost there,\u201d Enji\u2019s gruff voice echoed from the front, causing all of \nthe siblings to jump. \u201cSo you can all give it a rest.\u201d</p><p>This whole \ntrip was a bit baffling to Shouto. Before, their winter trips usually \nhappened thanks to their mother, and she was certainly not going to be \nthere this time. Enji always acted as though the ski trips were the \nbiggest burden on him. He didn\u2019t even seem to enjoy skiing, though he \noften bragged he was the best at it. He could\u2019ve gone pro if he wanted \nor\u2026 something\u2026 Shouto usually tried to tune him out when he got to \nthat point.</p><p>And yet, even without his mother, somehow they were \nall on their way up to the mountains. Though Enji chose a new resort \nthis time, one Shouto and his siblings were unfamiliar with. None of \nthem complained though; Shouto wasn\u2019t sure if any of them wanted to be \nhere without their mother.</p><p>Shouto kept his eyes locked on the \nsnowflakes swirling outside his window. His mother always did adore the \nsnow. When the first flakes began to fall from the sky, she would rush \nto the window, her gray eyes illuminated with excitement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \nsnowing!\u201d she would call out, like a young child awake far too early on \nChristmas morning. \u201cCome here, Shouto.\u201d Her small hands would cup at his\n sides, and she would lift his tiny body up to the window. \u201cSoon,\u201d she \nsaid, smiling, \u201cthe world will be covered in a frozen white blanket. And\n we\u2019ll be nice and warm inside. But maybe\u2026 we can go out and play \nlater.\u201d</p><p>Shouto\u2019s eyes twinkled then, his hands curling around the \nsill. His heart was always full of wonder for their snowy yard. His \nmother made it sound ethereal; a winter wonderland of adventures waiting\n for just the two of them beyond the glass of the window.</p><p>Things \nwere different now. His breath, though cold, still fogged up the glass \nwindow of the car. The world a dull gray as it breezed past them on the \nhighway.</p><p>Soon\u2026 soon he would be free from this car, and not long\n after this trip he would be free forever from his father. He could live\n in the dorms at his university and as far as Shouto was concerned, the \nfurther away from that man he was, the better.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to be\n skiing all week, Father?\u201d Fuyumi asked. \u201cI was hoping maybe we could \ntake a day for cross-country? Or ice skating\u2026\u201d His sister trailed off,\n the words left unspoken.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>\u201cBecause Mother also enjoyed doing those things too.\u201d</i>\n</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you want during your downtime,\u201d Enji said. \u201cYou will\n be skiing at the designated times. I already paid for the tickets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n see,\u201d Fuyumi muttered, and Shouto saw her head tilt downwards. Fuyumi \nand their mother often spent a day together ice skating. Of all the \nwinter activities, it was Fuyumi\u2019s favorite, and one she excelled at.</p><p>Shouto\n didn\u2019t love ice skating, but he had a feeling Natsuo would force Shouto\n to go with the two of them at one point on this trip. He supposed for \nFuyumi, he could stomach it. In fact, doing various activities with his \nbrother and sister would probably be far more fulfilling than anything \ntheir father planned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Natsuo cheered, pressing his \nface flat against the window. Sometimes Shouto seriously couldn\u2019t \nbelieve Natsuo was older than him. \u201cLook at this place! It\u2019s huge!\u201d</p><p>Shouto\n leaned towards the middle of the car, catching a glimpse at the large \nfour story lodge. His nose wrinkled. His mother would\u2019ve hated this \nplace. She much preferred smaller cabins, a more homey feel, than\u2026 \ncommercialized lodges.</p><p>Then again, nothing about this trip was \ngoing to feel homey at all, so Shouto supposed this ginormous lodge was \nmore than appropriate.</p><p>\u201cShouto, get my bags while I take down the skis,\u201d Enji said, putting the car in park.</p><p>It\n was always him. No surprise there. Shouto didn\u2019t answer and instead \nstepped out of the car, his boots squishing against the dirty, slushy \nsnow beneath his feet.</p><p>He made his way to the back of the car and \nlifted up the trunk, pulling his own bag and the various bags Enji \npacked. Why his father needed more than one bag was beyond Shouto, but \nhe didn\u2019t feel like listening to the man scold him if he didn\u2019t grab \nall\u2026 three of them. He sighed, slinging one over his shoulder, holding\n one on his wrist and the other two in his hand.</p><p>He used his elbow\n to slam the trunk shut and stumbled backwards, clutching two of the \nbags close to his chest as he tried not to fall. It was then, when he \nwas making a complete and utter fool of himself, that he caught eyes \nwith a girl.</p><p>She was probably about his age, and she was, well, \nstunning. He probably looked like a fool staring right at her, but her \nsharp dark eyes drew him in. Her pale cheeks were a bit flushed, \nprobably reddened from the kiss of the cool air.

She shivered, though it was warm in the car. She could \nalready imagine the sharp breeze nipping at her cheeks, her nose tinged \nred as she swooped through the powdery snow with her skis.</small></p><p><small>She \ndaydreamed about her family&rsquo;s yearly trip for weeks before. Sitting in \nclass, her mind would often drift to the slopes. She could almost feel \nthe wind brushing through her dark locks, the white powder covering her \nlegs as she zipped down the mountain with her parents.</small></p><p>Pressing \nher finger against the fogged up glass, she doodled a picture of a \nmountain on the window, a small smile pulling across her lips.</p><p>The yearly trip would be a nice reprieve from her frustrating, anxious thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo,\n darling, don&rsquo;t smudge your finger against the window. It leaves \nprints!&rdquo; her mother chided, glancing to the backseat. &ldquo;Take a nap if \nyou&rsquo;re tired. We still have at least another hour left in the car.&rdquo;</p><p>Momo\n jolted, sitting up straight. &ldquo;Yes, Mother, I apologize,&rdquo; she said, \nbowing her head. Her cheeks heated up. She wasn&rsquo;t a child anymore, her \nmother shouldn&rsquo;t have to scold her over something so petty.</p><p>She \ntook a deep breath, leaning her head back against the side of the door. \nFor as long as Momo could remember, her family took a two week trip to \nthe mountains for her winter break. They spent the two weeks skiing, ice\n skating, and relaxing in the hot tub. It was Momo&rsquo;s favorite time of \nyear.</p><p>Her parents spent the majority of their time working, and \neven free time often turned into extra work, leaving them very little \ntime with their daughter. But on their yearly ski trip, most of the time\n belonged to her.</p><p>As a child, there was one year her parents \npawned her off on a ski instructor, but after a few days of learning \nvarious techniques, Momo was proud to be able to keep up with her \nparents. Even as a child, she was focused and intelligent.</p><p>&ldquo;Is your friend going to be here this year?&rdquo; her mother asked, pulling Momo from her thoughts.</p><p>When\n she grew older, there were some times her parents wished to spend \nalone, which Momo could understand. They both worked so much they barely\n had time for each other as well. And so Momo spent her free time at the\n lodge cafe or recreational center, which was how she met one of her \ngreatest friends, Jirou Kyouka.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! I forgot to text her this morning!&rdquo; Momo said, pulling out her phone.</p><p>[Kyouka: 4 New Messages]</p><p>A small giggle left Momo&rsquo;s lips. It was no surprise Kyouka was already texting her.</p><p>Kyouka&rsquo;s\n parents were the clingy type. Both well-known musicians, their winter \ntrip was time for family bonding, and Kyouka often begged to escape to \nspend time with Momo.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, when are you getting here? I&rsquo;m already dying.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: My Dad is suggesting our families all karaoke tonight. I only have so many ways to say no.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: I really hope you&rsquo;re at least on your way.</p><p>[Text\n from Kyouka]: Yaomomo, seriously! Where are you?! This boy just talked \nto me and I swear, I can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s cute or an idiot.</p><p>Momo \ncouldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at the last text. Momo had to admit, the few \ntimes Kyouka was vocal about her various attractions, Momo found herself\n questioning Kyouka&rsquo;s taste, mostly in men.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Don&rsquo;t worry, don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;re almost there! Sorry I didn&rsquo;t text back, I was a little distracted.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Why does your family do everything in slow motion?</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: I apologize, Kyouka! We are really close! Mother said we&rsquo;re about an hour away!</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: AN HOUR!? &hellip;Killing me slowly&hellip;</p><p>She\n smiled, brushing her thumb over the screen. Her heart throbbed with \nanticipation. She and Kyouka only saw each other a few times a year; \nalways on their two week family trips, and occasionally during summer \nbreak for a mid-year sleepover.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: Why don&rsquo;t you tell me more about this boy?</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Ugh. Just get here. He works at the cafe, you&rsquo;ll meet him.</p><p>[Text Kyouka]: If you&rsquo;re really bored, you could tell me now.</p><p>[Text from Kyouka]: Nope. This is your punishment for being so damn late!</p><p>&ldquo;I take it you two are making plans already?&rdquo; Her mother&rsquo;s voice made Momo jump, clutching her phone to her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes! Kyouka is&hellip; very eager for our arrival,&rdquo; Momo giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;That\n makes two of us,&rdquo; the woman sighed. Momo&rsquo;s mother never did well when \nthey traveled in the snow. It was part of the reason they had such a \nlate start; her mother secretly wanted to wait until the snow passed, \nhoping they wouldn&rsquo;t have to drive through the light storm.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there, darling,&rdquo; her father reassured, and Momo turned her gaze back towards the window.</p><p>The\n snow wasn&rsquo;t falling very fast. It was light and gentle, though it \nseemed to be sticking to the ground. It was Momo&rsquo;s favorite kind of a \nweather; cold, but with a purpose, the ground snuggling in its blanket \nof white.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh, not wanting her parents to \nhear. As excited as she was for the trip, she hated the idea of it \ncoming to an end. And as usual, Momo knew the time would pass incredibly\n fast, which meant returning to school for the last time in the spring.</p><p>A\n lump formed in her throat as she thought about leaving school. Of \ncourse university loomed on the horizon, so it wasn&rsquo;t as if she would be\n free from studying (not that she wanted to be). But the idea of \nactually furthering her studies, taking her one step closer to \nadulthood, terrified her. Momo had no clue what she planned on doing \nwith her life, and university was a strong reminder of her unknown \nfuture.</p><p>This most likely wouldn&rsquo;t be her last ski trip, but for some reason, she kept feeling like after high school things would <i>feel</i> different.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\n here,&rdquo; her father said, and Momo immediately pressed her cheek against \nthe window, staring at the giant lodge in front of her.</p><p>It never \nseemed to change. The large wooden building which stood at the base of \nthe mountains was four stories tall, balconies decorated by fairy \nlights. Large stone chimneys pressed against the side of the various \nlodges, and Momo could already picture the fire burning in the pits of \nthe lobbies. Behind the lit up building, ski slopes cut through the \nmountain, separated by long strips of green trees. Various chair lifts \nand gondolas strung up the mountain, still running even later in the \nafternoon. After dark, a few trails were lit up for night skiing. For \nnow, Momo saw a few small figures zooming back and forth across the \nslopes.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be nice to get out there tomorrow.&rdquo; Her father sighed happily.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, anything to be out of this car,&rdquo; her mother said, gently touching his leg. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get checked in.&rdquo;</p><p>They\n pulled into a parking spot, and Momo stared at the lodge, completely \nlit up in front of her. The roof was dusted by snow and the sun shone, \nmaking the white power glisten with sparkles. Opening the door, Momo was\n hit by a cold breeze, but her heart felt warm, as if she was home.</p><p>Next\n to her, another car door slammed shut and Momo glanced to her side. \nStruggling to hold four different bags, a boy her age with perfectly \nsymmetrical red and white hair stared at her for a moment. His eyes were\n two different colors, and they absolutely fascinated her. He also had a\n scar over his left eye, and Momo flushed, realizing her staring at his \neyes might have been mistaken for focusing on the scar.</p><p>Really, he was quite handsome. Momo had never found herself drawn to someone so fast.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouto! Hurry up!&rdquo; A tall, gruff looking man stormed by him, pushing the lock on the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; the boy muttered, turning away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo! Come grab your bags.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A-Ah! Right!&rdquo; Her father&rsquo;s voice pulled her out of her daze, and she dashed around to the back of the car, grabbed her bags.</p><p>She\n glanced behind her, watching the boy walk away. It wasn&rsquo;t unusual to \nsee new people here every year; it was a popular resort, and expensive, \nso some people made it a special, one-time only trip. However, Momo \ncouldn&rsquo;t help but follow him as he walked away, wondering if she would \nsee him again during her stay.</p><p>~~</p><p>Shouto hated car rides, \nespecially long ones with his family. They were usually deadly silent, \nor consisted of Natsuo loudly (and obnoxiously) singing along with \nwhatever was on his iPod. Fuyumi would attempt to quiet him down, but \neventually it would take their father&rsquo;s loud, frustrated voice to get \nhim to stop.</p><p>Then it would be completely and utterly silent. So \nmuch so, Shouto could hear his own breath, as well as the soft breaths \nof his siblings, all of them desperate to expel the tension hanging \nabove the car.</p><p>Currently, they were past the point of awkward \nsilence, and Natsuo finally started talking again. Unfortunately, his \nattention fell on Shouto. &ldquo;Do you even remember how to ski, Shouto? Mom \ntaught you when you were so little.&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto&rsquo;s chest tightened at the mention of his mother. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he muttered, turning his eyes towards the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Hah?\n Shouto!&rdquo; Natsuo whined and poked at his cheek. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;I \nknow&rsquo;? Do you 'know&rsquo; how to ski still? Or are you just saying you 'know&rsquo;\n Mom taught you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave him alone Natsuo&hellip;&rdquo; Fuyumi tried again, \nturning around from the front seat, and gently placed her palm on his \nforearm, pressing against it.</p><p>Shouto couldn&rsquo;t help but be jealous \nToya got out of this trip simply because he was currently studying \nabroad and decided not to return home for winter break. If Shouto could \nleave and never come back, he would&rsquo;ve gladly chosen that option.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Shouto said finally.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Well good then! I didn&rsquo;t want to have to teach you again!&rdquo; Natsuo chuckled. There was no response.</p><p>Finally\n realizing he wasn&rsquo;t going to garner the response he wished for from \neither Shouto or Fuyumi, Natsuo lay his head back against the window and\n shut his eyes.</p><p>Relieved, a breath of cold air slipped from \nShouto&rsquo;s lips. His father just happened to have the body temperature \nfrom hell, and he rarely remembered to put the heat on. There was no way\n Shouto was going to ask the man for anything either.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re \nalmost there,&rdquo; Enji&rsquo;s gruff voice echoed from the front, causing all of \nthe siblings to jump. &ldquo;So you can all give it a rest.&rdquo;</p><p>This whole \ntrip was a bit baffling to Shouto. Before, their winter trips usually \nhappened thanks to their mother, and she was certainly not going to be \nthere this time. Enji always acted as though the ski trips were the \nbiggest burden on him. He didn&rsquo;t even seem to enjoy skiing, though he \noften bragged he was the best at it. He could&rsquo;ve gone pro if he wanted \nor&hellip; something&hellip; Shouto usually tried to tune him out when he got to \nthat point.</p><p>And yet, even without his mother, somehow they were \nall on their way up to the mountains. Though Enji chose a new resort \nthis time, one Shouto and his siblings were unfamiliar with. None of \nthem complained though; Shouto wasn&rsquo;t sure if any of them wanted to be \nhere without their mother.</p><p>Shouto kept his eyes locked on the \nsnowflakes swirling outside his window. His mother always did adore the \nsnow. When the first flakes began to fall from the sky, she would rush \nto the window, her gray eyes illuminated with excitement.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s \nsnowing!&rdquo; she would call out, like a young child awake far too early on \nChristmas morning. &ldquo;Come here, Shouto.&rdquo; Her small hands would cup at his\n sides, and she would lift his tiny body up to the window. &ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; she \nsaid, smiling, &ldquo;the world will be covered in a frozen white blanket. And\n we&rsquo;ll be nice and warm inside. But maybe&hellip; we can go out and play \nlater.&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto&rsquo;s eyes twinkled then, his hands curling around the \nsill. His heart was always full of wonder for their snowy yard. His \nmother made it sound ethereal; a winter wonderland of adventures waiting\n for just the two of them beyond the glass of the window.</p><p>Things \nwere different now. His breath, though cold, still fogged up the glass \nwindow of the car. The world a dull gray as it breezed past them on the \nhighway.</p><p>Soon&hellip; soon he would be free from this car, and not long\n after this trip he would be free forever from his father. He could live\n in the dorms at his university and as far as Shouto was concerned, the \nfurther away from that man he was, the better.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we going to be\n skiing all week, Father?&rdquo; Fuyumi asked. &ldquo;I was hoping maybe we could \ntake a day for cross-country? Or ice skating&hellip;&rdquo; His sister trailed off,\n the words left unspoken.</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Because Mother also enjoyed doing those things too.&rdquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;Do whatever you want during your downtime,&rdquo; Enji said. &ldquo;You will\n be skiing at the designated times. I already paid for the tickets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n see,&rdquo; Fuyumi muttered, and Shouto saw her head tilt downwards. Fuyumi \nand their mother often spent a day together ice skating. Of all the \nwinter activities, it was Fuyumi&rsquo;s favorite, and one she excelled at.</p><p>Shouto\n didn&rsquo;t love ice skating, but he had a feeling Natsuo would force Shouto\n to go with the two of them at one point on this trip. He supposed for \nFuyumi, he could stomach it. In fact, doing various activities with his \nbrother and sister would probably be far more fulfilling than anything \ntheir father planned.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Natsuo cheered, pressing his \nface flat against the window. Sometimes Shouto seriously couldn&rsquo;t \nbelieve Natsuo was older than him. &ldquo;Look at this place! It&rsquo;s huge!&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto\n leaned towards the middle of the car, catching a glimpse at the large \nfour story lodge. His nose wrinkled. His mother would&rsquo;ve hated this \nplace. She much preferred smaller cabins, a more homey feel, than&hellip; \ncommercialized lodges.</p><p>Then again, nothing about this trip was \ngoing to feel homey at all, so Shouto supposed this ginormous lodge was \nmore than appropriate.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouto, get my bags while I take down the skis,&rdquo; Enji said, putting the car in park.</p><p>It\n was always him. No surprise there. Shouto didn&rsquo;t answer and instead \nstepped out of the car, his boots squishing against the dirty, slushy \nsnow beneath his feet.</p><p>He made his way to the back of the car and \nlifted up the trunk, pulling his own bag and the various bags Enji \npacked. Why his father needed more than one bag was beyond Shouto, but \nhe didn&rsquo;t feel like listening to the man scold him if he didn&rsquo;t grab \nall&hellip; three of them. He sighed, slinging one over his shoulder, holding\n one on his wrist and the other two in his hand.</p><p>He used his elbow\n to slam the trunk shut and stumbled backwards, clutching two of the \nbags close to his chest as he tried not to fall. It was then, when he \nwas making a complete and utter fool of himself, that he caught eyes \nwith a girl.</p><p>She was probably about his age, and she was, well, \nstunning. He probably looked like a fool staring right at her, but her \nsharp dark eyes drew him in. Her pale cheeks were a bit flushed, \nprobably reddened from the kiss of the cool air. Her dark black hair was\n in a ponytail which fanned out against the back of her head, and red, \nfluffy ear muffs covered her ears.</p><p>Their eyes met and she stared \nright back, her lips pulling into a curious circle. Shouto could \nhonestly say he had never seen anyone quite as beautiful as her.</p><p>How lame.</p><p>He\n opened his mouth as if to speak, but he had no idea what he would even \nsay to a girl like her.

Shouto was thankful he didn&rsquo;t drop the damn bags.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo;\n he muttered, reluctantly turning away from her. It was silly to regret \nit; it wasn&rsquo;t as if Shouto had anything to say to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo! Come grab your bags.&rdquo; He heard a voice call from behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;A-Ah! Right!&rdquo;</p><p>He\n was tempted to look back, curious to see her one more time, but he \nsupposed he might see her during the trip anyway. The lodge was huge, so\n the probability was low. But Shouto felt a little lighter as he carried\n the bags. The thought of seeing her again made his heart beat just a \nlittle faster.</p><p>Maybe he would survive this trip after all.</p>",
