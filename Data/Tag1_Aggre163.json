        "body": "<p>*some time later, Haida wakes up, in a small house, looking out to rice fields*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> GAH! What the-?! &hellip;wha\u2026<br/></p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You\u2019re up! Finally! *hands him a bowl of rice* Here you go. Eat up!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *grabs the bowl* What the-&hellip;how did you find this?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, let\u2019s just say you were lucky where you crashed. A farmer found us, and brought us over here to recover. Turns out he had a bunch of rice that was almost ready at the time of the food being taken away, so he hid it, in case they were to try to steal it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh. *starts eating* &hellip;needs some sauce, but it\u2019ll do.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hey, don\u2019t complain! I\u2019ve been starving for something all day. *eating like an animal*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hehe, oh, I know, don\u2019t worry\u2026*looks off to the fields, into the forest, and mountains* \u2026..heh.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> What\u2019s wrong?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Ah, just wondering how we\u2019ve survived as long as we have.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;what do you mean?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I mean&hellip;I dunno, it always feels like every time we seem to legitimately send the Bryriam back a bit, they always come back, full force, and we have to start over. And every time, it always seems like they\u2019re stronger than ever before. Like, where does it end? Will we finally have the upper hand, or will they win? I want to protect the Earth&hellip;for you. For Ikari. For Fenneko. For everyone\u2026.but I\u2019m starting to feel like that will quickly become pointless. Especially with this recent dude, their plan straight up knocked us out! It could\u2019ve gotten us killed! How the hell do you jump back from that?! I&hellip;I don\u2019t know. *continues eating*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;well, you know how I jump back?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;how?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I see you do it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;hmm?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> It\u2019s gonna be a little weird to explain, but&hellip;remember, when I was pregnant with Ikari? At that time, crime fighting&hellip;that wasn\u2019t something I could keep doing at that time. So, you and I agreed you would do all of that, while I stayed back, and I would get back into it once Ikari was born.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, yeah. That was kind of a given. It came as a little bit of a shock to me when you came back, almost as soon as he was delivered. I would\u2019ve figured you\u2019d need a little extra time.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You know why I came back as soon as I did? Because you put up with fighting them off for nine long months. You had to go through that alone. You fought them neck and neck, and you were occasionally on the brink of near death&hellip;but every night, you came home, you crawled in bed with me, and asked me how my day went, treating it as just another day at work. Even when you were a bloodied mess, and we had to tend to your injuries, you kept it up. You wouldn\u2019t stop for a single second, and&hellip;there\u2019s something to admire about that, Haida\u2026.you remember when we first brought home Ikari?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Y-yeah. It was at night. He was so tired, we just laid him in his cradle, and let him sleep.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> And you remember what we talked about afterwards?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Um\u2026.I kind of forgot.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, we said that now that we have a baby, our responsibilities are piled on more. The game has been changed slightly. We have to work harder. We first just fought evil for the safety of the Earth. But now, we don\u2019t just fight for that. We fight, so that our son can have a bright future. So that he doesn\u2019t have to live under the iron fist of the Byriam. I don\u2019t know how much more we will be able to take of them, Haida. I really don\u2019t. But as long as we\u2019re still here, we\u2019re still able to give hope to the people, I\u2019m not gonna stop fighting them, and I hope you don\u2019t either.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *smiles* I won\u2019t.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *smiles back* Good. *suddenly, her phone rings, and she answers* Hello?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Hey, Retsy! You guys alright? Saw the nasty crash you two took.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> How did-</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Cameras. Remember?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Ah, right. Anyways, we\u2019re fine. How\u2019s Ikari?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> He\u2019s A-Okay, found some water to give him, to hold him over. Though, he might need to be changed soon. Ignoring that, though, um&hellip;any chance you guys are coming back to town? Because I\u2019m preeeeetty certain the Byriam has taken the city hostage. *overseeing a large crowd of people, surrounding Phoenixia, Kuishinb\u014d, and the Cronion soldiers*</p><p><b>Phoenixia:</b> *distant* PEOPLE OF TOKYO! WE WILL GIVE YOU BACK YOUR FOOD SUPPLY! HOWEVER, IN ORDER FOR THIS TO OCCUR, YOU MUST GIVE COMPLETE AND TOTAL SURRENDER TO THE BYRIAM EMPIRE!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> &hellip;as you can see, kinda need to hurry your asses over here.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Oh! Uh, we\u2019ll be heading over there now! Thanks! *hangs up* Come on! Phoenixia\u2019s got the city wrapped around her finger!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yikes! Right! *they get up, and run towards their motorcycle, with an elderly man waiting for them*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Thank you so much for your help! *the two mount the motorcycle*</p><p><b>Old man:</b> No worries! Now get back to Tokyo! And don\u2019t worry, your secret\u2019s safe with me.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Thank you, sir. *they drive off*</p><p>*meanwhile\u2026*</p><p><b>Civilian:</b> P-please! Just let us eat! We\u2019ve been wasting away all day!</p><p><b>Phoenixia: </b>What did I tell you? You surrender to the Byriam Empire, and you will receive your nutrients. Until then, you will starve. KUISHINB\u014c! Chow down!</p><p><b>Kuishinb\u014d:</b> Yes, ma\u2019am! *grabs out a giant play of food, to the dismayed wails of the crowd, and opens his mouth* YOOOO-</p><p><b>???:</b> HOLD IT! *the monster stops, as he, and everyone else, turns to see Kamen Haida and Pretty-Rage, driving up to the commotion!*</p><p><b>Phoenixia:</b> WHAT?! They\u2019re back?!</p><p><b>Kamen Haida:</b> Better than ever! *they stop the motorcycle, and jump into the action* *to the civilians* Everyone, head out, we\u2019ll take care of this!</p><p>*the people begin running away, as the Cronion soldiers charge at the two for battle!*</p><p><b>Pretty-Rage:</b> Ready?!</p><p><b>Kamen Haida:</b> Ready!</p><p>*the two begin their battle with the Cronions*</p><p><b>Pretty-Rage:</b> Heyah! *roundhouse kicks some soldiers, who fall to the ground*</p><p><b>Cronion:</b> *squeals, as it tries to wack her with a staff&hellip;only to be blocked with her microphone, and blasted out of the way!*</p><p><b>Kamen Haida: </b>*punches one Cronion in the face multiple times, kicks a few others, backflips onto one, jumps off of that soldier, and then jump kicks another!*</p><p><b>Phoenixia:</b> Ugh! That does it! KUISHINB\u014c! GO!</p><p><b>Kuishinb\u014d:</b> Yes, ma\u2019am! *jumps into action* YOOOOOOO!!!! *slashes the two!*</p><p><b>Pretty-Rage:</b> Agh!</p><p><b>Kamen Haida:</b> GAH! *they step back, but keep fighting the monster!*</p><p><b>Pretty-Rage:</b> *tries blasting Kuishinb\u014d with her mic!* Take that!</p><p><b>Kuishinb\u014d:</b> *deflects the blast!* Hohohoho! Nice try, but you can\u2019t stop me! *opens his mouth, to reveal a giant beam* KUIARASHIMASU! *blasts it at the two, who are sent flying back a bit!*</p><p><b>Kamen Haida:</b> AAAH!</p><p><b>Pretty-Rage: </b>AAAH! *they fall to the ground* Crap! What do we do?!</p><p><b>Kamen Haida:</b> I-I don\u2019t know!</p><p><b>Kuishinb\u014d:</b> *walks up to them* This was fun! But this, alas, is the end! *unleashes his sword, aiming to strike them!* YOOO-*suddenly gets blasted by several laser shots from the sky!* OW! Wha?!</p><p><b>Phoenixia:</b> *looks up* What?!</p><p><b>Pretty-Rage and Kamen Haida:</b> *they both look up* Huh?!</p><p>*up on top, they see a lone figure, in robotic armor, and helmet, somewhat resembling that of an astronaut, with a laser gun in it\u2019s hand*</p><p><b>Pretty-Rage:</b> Who&hellip;who\u2019s that?</p><p><b>Phoenixia:</b> Identify yourself!</p><p><b>Being:</b> *jumps down, and starts walking towards Kuishinb\u014d* My name is Cosmotaro.

Eat up!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *grabs the bowl* What the-\u2026how did you find this?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, let\u2019s just say you were lucky where you crashed. A farmer found us, and brought us over here to recover. Turns out he had a bunch of rice that was almost ready at the time of the food being taken away, so he hid it, in case they were to try to steal it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh. *starts eating* \u2026needs some sauce, but it\u2019ll do.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hey, don\u2019t complain!

And every time, it always seems like they\u2019re stronger than ever before. Like, where does it end? Will we finally have the upper hand, or will they win? I want to protect the Earth\u2026for you. For Ikari. For Fenneko. For everyone\u2026.but I\u2019m starting to feel like that will quickly become pointless. Especially with this recent dude, their plan straight up knocked us out! It could\u2019ve gotten us killed! How the hell do you jump back from that?! I\u2026I don\u2019t know. *continues eating*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> \u2026well, you know how I jump back?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026how?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I see you do it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026hmm?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> It\u2019s gonna be a little weird to explain, but\u2026remember, when I was pregnant with Ikari? At that time, crime fighting\u2026that wasn\u2019t something I could keep doing at that time. So, you and I agreed you would do all of that, while I stayed back, and I would get back into it once Ikari was born.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, yeah. That was kind of a given. It came as a little bit of a shock to me when you came back, almost as soon as he was delivered. I would\u2019ve figured you\u2019d need a little extra time.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You know why I came back as soon as I did? Because you put up with fighting them off for nine long months. You had to go through that alone. You fought them neck and neck, and you were occasionally on the brink of near death\u2026but every night, you came home, you crawled in bed with me, and asked me how my day went, treating it as just another day at work. Even when you were a bloodied mess, and we had to tend to your injuries, you kept it up. You wouldn\u2019t stop for a single second, and\u2026there\u2019s something to admire about that, Haida\u2026.you remember when we first brought home Ikari?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Y-yeah. It was at night. He was so tired, we just laid him in his cradle, and let him sleep.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> And you remember what we talked about afterwards?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Um\u2026.I kind of forgot.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, we said that now that we have a baby, our responsibilities are piled on more. The game has been changed slightly. We have to work harder. We first just fought evil for the safety of the Earth. But now, we don\u2019t just fight for that. We fight, so that our son can have a bright future. So that he doesn\u2019t have to live under the iron fist of the Byriam. I don\u2019t know how much more we will be able to take of them, Haida. I really don\u2019t. But as long as we\u2019re still here, we\u2019re still able to give hope to the people, I\u2019m not gonna stop fighting them, and I hope you don\u2019t either.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *smiles* I won\u2019t.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *smiles back* Good. *suddenly, her phone rings, and she answers* Hello?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Hey, Retsy!

What the-?! \u2026wha\u2026<br></p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You\u2019re up! Finally! *hands him a bowl of rice* Here you go. Eat up!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *grabs the bowl* What the-\u2026how did you find this?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, let\u2019s just say you were lucky where you crashed. A farmer found us, and brought us over here to recover. Turns out he had a bunch of rice that was almost ready at the time of the food being taken away, so he hid it, in case they were to try to steal it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh. *starts eating* \u2026needs some sauce, but it\u2019ll do.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hey, don\u2019t complain! I\u2019ve been starving for something all day. *eating like an animal*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hehe, oh, I know, don\u2019t worry\u2026*looks off to the fields, into the forest, and mountains* \u2026..heh.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> What\u2019s wrong?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Ah, just wondering how we\u2019ve survived as long as we have.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> \u2026what do you mean?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I mean\u2026I dunno, it always feels like every time we seem to legitimately send the Bryriam back a bit, they always come back, full force, and we have to start over. And every time, it always seems like they\u2019re stronger than ever before. Like, where does it end? Will we finally have the upper hand, or will they win? I want to protect the Earth\u2026for you. For Ikari. For Fenneko. For everyone\u2026.but I\u2019m starting to feel like that will quickly become pointless. Especially with this recent dude, their plan straight up knocked us out! It could\u2019ve gotten us killed! How the hell do you jump back from that?! I\u2026I don\u2019t know. *continues eating*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> \u2026well, you know how I jump back?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026how?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I see you do it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026hmm?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> It\u2019s gonna be a little weird to explain, but\u2026remember, when I was pregnant with Ikari? At that time, crime fighting\u2026that wasn\u2019t something I could keep doing at that time. So, you and I agreed you would do all of that, while I stayed back, and I would get back into it once Ikari was born.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, yeah. That was kind of a given. It came as a little bit of a shock to me when you came back, almost as soon as he was delivered. I would\u2019ve figured you\u2019d need a little extra time.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You know why I came back as soon as I did? Because you put up with fighting them off for nine long months. You had to go through that alone. You fought them neck and neck, and you were occasionally on the brink of near death\u2026but every night, you came home, you crawled in bed with me, and asked me how my day went, treating it as just another day at work. Even when you were a bloodied mess, and we had to tend to your injuries, you kept it up. You wouldn\u2019t stop for a single second, and\u2026there\u2019s something to admire about that, Haida\u2026.you remember when we first brought home Ikari?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Y-yeah. It was at night. He was so tired, we just laid him in his cradle, and let him sleep.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> And you remember what we talked about afterwards?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Um\u2026.I kind of forgot.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, we said that now that we have a baby, our responsibilities are piled on more. The game has been changed slightly. We have to work harder. We first just fought evil for the safety of the Earth. But now, we don\u2019t just fight for that. We fight, so that our son can have a bright future. So that he doesn\u2019t have to live under the iron fist of the Byriam. I don\u2019t know how much more we will be able to take of them, Haida. I really don\u2019t. But as long as we\u2019re still here, we\u2019re still able to give hope to the people, I\u2019m not gonna stop fighting them, and I hope you don\u2019t either.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *smiles* I won\u2019t.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *smiles back* Good. *suddenly, her phone rings, and she answers* Hello?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Hey, Retsy!

How\u2019s Ikari?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> He\u2019s A-Okay, found some water to give him, to hold him over. Though, he might need to be changed soon. Ignoring that, though, um\u2026any chance you guys are coming back to town?

What the-?! &hellip;wha&hellip;<br /></p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You&rsquo;re up! Finally! *hands him a bowl of rice* Here you go. Eat up!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *grabs the bowl* What the-&hellip;how did you find this?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, let&rsquo;s just say you were lucky where you crashed. A farmer found us, and brought us over here to recover. Turns out he had a bunch of rice that was almost ready at the time of the food being taken away, so he hid it, in case they were to try to steal it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh. *starts eating* &hellip;needs some sauce, but it&rsquo;ll do.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hey, don&rsquo;t complain! I&rsquo;ve been starving for something all day. *eating like an animal*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hehe, oh, I know, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;*looks off to the fields, into the forest, and mountains* &hellip;..heh.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> What&rsquo;s wrong?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Ah, just wondering how we&rsquo;ve survived as long as we have.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;what do you mean?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I mean&hellip;I dunno, it always feels like every time we seem to legitimately send the Bryriam back a bit, they always come back, full force, and we have to start over. And every time, it always seems like they&rsquo;re stronger than ever before. Like, where does it end? Will we finally have the upper hand, or will they win? I want to protect the Earth&hellip;for you. For Ikari. For Fenneko. For everyone&hellip;.but I&rsquo;m starting to feel like that will quickly become pointless. Especially with this recent dude, their plan straight up knocked us out! It could&rsquo;ve gotten us killed! How the hell do you jump back from that?! I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know. *continues eating*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;well, you know how I jump back?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;how?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I see you do it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;hmm?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> It&rsquo;s gonna be a little weird to explain, but&hellip;remember, when I was pregnant with Ikari? At that time, crime fighting&hellip;that wasn&rsquo;t something I could keep doing at that time. So, you and I agreed you would do all of that, while I stayed back, and I would get back into it once Ikari was born.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, yeah. That was kind of a given. It came as a little bit of a shock to me when you came back, almost as soon as he was delivered. I would&rsquo;ve figured you&rsquo;d need a little extra time.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You know why I came back as soon as I did? Because you put up with fighting them off for nine long months. You had to go through that alone. You fought them neck and neck, and you were occasionally on the brink of near death&hellip;but every night, you came home, you crawled in bed with me, and asked me how my day went, treating it as just another day at work. Even when you were a bloodied mess, and we had to tend to your injuries, you kept it up. You wouldn&rsquo;t stop for a single second, and&hellip;there&rsquo;s something to admire about that, Haida&hellip;.you remember when we first brought home Ikari?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Y-yeah. It was at night. He was so tired, we just laid him in his cradle, and let him sleep.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> And you remember what we talked about afterwards?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Um&hellip;.I kind of forgot.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Well, we said that now that we have a baby, our responsibilities are piled on more. The game has been changed slightly. We have to work harder. We first just fought evil for the safety of the Earth. But now, we don&rsquo;t just fight for that. We fight, so that our son can have a bright future. So that he doesn&rsquo;t have to live under the iron fist of the Byriam. I don&rsquo;t know how much more we will be able to take of them, Haida. I really don&rsquo;t. But as long as we&rsquo;re still here, we&rsquo;re still able to give hope to the people, I&rsquo;m not gonna stop fighting them, and I hope you don&rsquo;t either.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *smiles* I won&rsquo;t.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *smiles back* Good. *suddenly, her phone rings, and she answers* Hello?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Hey, Retsy! You guys alright? Saw the nasty crash you two took.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> How did-</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Cameras. Remember?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Ah, right. Anyways, we&rsquo;re fine. How&rsquo;s Ikari?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> He&rsquo;s A-Okay, found some water to give him, to hold him over. Though, he might need to be changed soon. Ignoring that, though, um&hellip;any chance you guys are coming back to town? Because I&rsquo;m preeeeetty certain the Byriam has taken the city hostage. *overseeing a large crowd of people, surrounding Phoenixia, Kuishinb&#333;, and the Cronion soldiers*</p><p><b>Phoenixia:</b> *distant* PEOPLE OF TOKYO!
