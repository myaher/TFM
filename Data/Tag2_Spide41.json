Like in spider-man PS4.  I then think that this would lead to a father/son bond as Tony Stark and Peter Parker had and coming around full circle to the quote in the FFH trailer \u201cThe world needs its next Iron Man,\u201d which is obviously talking about being a leader and his ability but I also think he\u2019s going to fill this role of parental or even mentor to Miles (very likely leading to a similar scene from endgame in which Miles will be crying over Peter dying because we know how much Marvel enjoyed hurting its fans) (also I\u2019d like to add this mentor position could also be towards Morgan Stark and it would be like a whole tragic full circle thing).

                "content": "<p><h1>Spiderverse</h1><p>So as we all know the spider that bit miles had the same powers that he did. We can see it in the invisibility bit here:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/100bd3f0d1a0a998a34dcc5cefd8a857/tumblr_prppeaky6B1szn2jl_640.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And what we can assume the neon blue parts of the spider relate to his venom strike (the electricity thing):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2a996fcdfa66ca3496f7dc11a417294/tumblr_prppebdyLZ1szn2jl_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But we also see the spider go through the dimension glitch just like the spider people from other dimensions.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba3ba73cc56b84c4ef4f5c071023e1c6/tumblr_prppeb2Ir11szn2jl_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This could be due to the spider coming from a different demention, possibly being also brought earlier in time like Gwen and so it&rsquo;s going through the glitch as well. However, we also know that the spider was very close to the super collider as it was likely living in that under ground whatever thingy that Miles and uncle Aaron went to. This could mean that the spider had been previously exposed to the molecular quantum mechanics and possibly altering it in some sort of way (idk I&rsquo;m not a scientist). If this is true rather than the theory that it came from another dimension, then it could mean that when it bit Miles it gave him the ability to safely travel through different demensions and not have his cells decay or glitch. This could happen through atomic transition (quantum leap). Atomic transition is what we know as changing electrons within atoms (our knowledge of it is limited) if Miles is able to do this at will then he could survive in other dimensions safely. This is when I bring up this picture:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/25074c9216e1e4de876e9543b323daf8/tumblr_prppecVumw1szn2jl_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This could be implying a sequel to spiderverse or could be hinting at Miles or any of the other spider people (but let&rsquo;s be honest it would be miles) going into the MCU. If he is able to &lsquo;Quantum leap&rsquo; then he would be completely safe to stay there or it could be a way of setting up MCU Miles Morales withMCU Peter Parker acting as a father figure to MCU Miles Morales just as Tony Stark did to him. This allows a sequel to spiderverse as Miles would go back to his universe after creating a bond with mcu Peter Parker who then decides he wants to help MCU Miles whether he is a spider person yet or not. Like in spider-man PS4.  I then think that this would lead to a father/son bond as Tony Stark and Peter Parker had and coming around full circle to the quote in the FFH trailer &ldquo;The world needs its next Iron Man,&rdquo; which is obviously talking about being a leader and his ability but I also think he&rsquo;s going to fill this role of parental or even mentor to Miles (very likely leading to a similar scene from endgame in which Miles will be crying over Peter dying because we know how much Marvel enjoyed hurting its fans) (also I&rsquo;d like to add this mentor position could also be towards Morgan Stark and it would be like a whole tragic full circle thing). Miles&rsquo; ability to be safe within any dimension opens up the possibility of him travelling between multiple dimensions in future movies and playing as kind of the multi verses spiderman rather than just this one dimension. </p><p>Anyway this is just a theory and don&rsquo;t take it as fact I just needed to get it off my chest after re-watching Spiderverse.</p></p>",
