I\u2019ll probably update much less frequently, especially since this chapter was already halfway written when i posted the prologue</p><p>Hours of stakeout stiffened Y/N\u2019s muscles like iron cables. Brutal winds threatened to crack their resolve, but they stood firm on the roof of the marketplace. Finger artfully coiled over the trigger, ready to shoot should the famed web-slinger cross their path. Weeks of planning went into this, hours spent tracking the hero\u2019s path across the city. And every single day, he\u2019d cross this one street. Once at the beginning of his patrol, and again at the end.</p><p>Y/N assumed that this street was where the boy lived. But they believed it would be better to shoot him in costume. It would make a stronger statement, Y/N was theatrical like that. What shattered the hopes of millions more than the death of a hero? Would a random boy dead in his apartment accomplish the same thing? No.</p><p>The distant sound of web shooters alerted Y/N to his approach. They cocked the gun, and aimed exactly where his head would be. Just a few more seconds, five to be exact.</p><!-- more --><p>Five, they exhaled, preparing for the shot.</p><p>Four, they could hear the exclamations of people on the street below. \u201cLook! It\u2019s Spider-Man!\u201d</p><p>Three, they could hear him approaching. The sound of web fluid exiting his shooters becoming louder, and louder.</p><p>Two, they could see him now. The light from street lamps illuminating him eerily.</p><p>One, he was right where they needed him to be. </p><p>They pulled the trigger, watching triumphantly as the bullet rushed towards him. He quickly turned, he had anticipated the shot. His gut warning him of the attacker. Shooting upwards, he pulled himself out of the way of the approaching bullet. Letting it crash uselessly into the neighboring building.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Y/N cursed. They never believed that the first attempt would yield any results, but they were so close.</p><p>And now Spider-Man was alerted to their presence. They darted behind a concrete wall. Hastily packing their weapons and double checking to ensure their mask was in place, confirming it was still covering the skin below their nose. The mask was decorated with the red and black webbed pattern that Spider-Man so famously sported. A bitter taste of irony, more theatrics on Y/N\u2019s part.</p><p>They had no intention of going toe-to-toe with Spider-Man. Not that they couldn\u2019t hold their own, but there was a risk of capture, and a risk that their employers would be compromised. A risk they weren\u2019t willing to take.</p><p>With everything in order they slung the bag containing the gun over their shoulder, sneaking carefully over to the fire escape. Spider-Man had just recovered his bearings and was now examining the building carefully, head pivoting as his eyes narrowed and enlarged mechanically.</p><p>Suddenly, he froze, he had spotted movement. Y/N\u2019s heart pounded as the fight-or-flight instinct kicked in, rooting them in place on the off chance he\u2019d move on</p><p>It was no use.</p><p>Spider-Man swung over and landed gracefully in front of Y/N. Examining them with interest.</p><p>\u201cI see you stole my look,\u201d he commented, nodding at their mask.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say that I wasn\u2019t first?\u201d \u00a0They fired back. Casually sliding their hand over to their hip, and tossing the bag aside.</p><p>\u201cYou got me there,\u201d he answered, putting his hands up as if to surrender, but instead firing a round of webs at the assassin. </p><p>Y/N was smarter than that. They dodged the webs effortlessly and pulled out the concealed knife that was hidden on their thigh.</p><p>\u201cPretty smart, Spider-Boy, trying to distract me with banter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Spider-Man,\u201d he answered indignantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your voice makes it seem as if you haven\u2019t even hit puberty yet. You may want to modify it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already am,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d Y/N answered. Swinging their knife as he was preoccupied, managing to tear away a bit of fabric. \u201cSometimes technology fails us, hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha, very funny,\u201d Spider-Man grumbled. Shifting into a fighting stance. \u201cWould you be so kind as to tell me why you just tried to shoot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy of course, young sir,\u201d they replied haughtily. Blocking Spider-Man\u2019s punches and throwing a kick, which he blocked as well, grabbing their leg and throwing them aside. \u201cI just really don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He said, shocked.</p><p>\u201cYou actually believe me?\u201d Y/N laughed. They rose to their feet, and managed to get a few punches in before he could react. They elbowed his kidney and smirked as he curled into himself in pain. Their eyes visibly lighting up with held in laughter.</p><p>He soon recovered and drove his knee into Y/N\u2019s stomach, winding them. As they stumbled, he anchored them to the ground with his webs.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time, pick fights with people you can actually win against,\u201d he teased, reaching up to rip away Y/N\u2019s mask.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Y/N began, before they were engulfed in flames. The web fluid melting away in the extreme heat. \u201cI think I pick fights just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d He stuttered before Y/N mercilessly shot waves of flame at him.</p><p>\u201cI have my ways,\u201d Y/N smirked. Commanding the flame to extinguish and shuddering as ice seemed to flood through their once fiery veins.</p><p>They checked to make sure their mask survived the blaze, and after confirming its presence, they approached the collapsed figure of Spider-Man.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at this point I wonder why I don\u2019t just start with that,\u201d Y/N mused as they pinned the hero to the ground. \u201cBut I doubt it matters to you. You would end up dead either way.\u201d</p><p>They rose their arm up in the air, preparing to plunge the knife down into his chest.</p><p>\u201cP-please,\u201d he gasped. Fear resonating in his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry kid, I don\u2019t have much of a choice,\u201d they swung down the knife, but the sound of a repulsor firing up interrupted them.</p><p>Y/N clutched the fallen hero and rolled, narrowly avoiding the energy blast fired off by the Iron Man suit that was directly behind them.</p><p>They jumped back to their feet and held the boy in front of them like a shield. Pressing the blade painfully against his windpipe. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d They shouted, \u201cdon\u2019t move or I slice his throat!\u201d</p><p>Y/N prayed that the suit was not just an AI, but in fact remotely controlled. Tony Stark would be more likely to listen to their demands than a cold and calculating machine.</p><p>Seconds ticked by as the suit planned it\u2019s next move. \u00a0Y/N breathed a sigh of relief as they watched the suit falter and lower it\u2019s outstretched arm.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, take it easy,\u201d the suit said mechanically, \u201cjust let him go.\u201d</p><p>Y/N backed towards the ledge, teetering on the edge of the building. They weren\u2019t too high up, but falling would hurt like hell. But if they were unlucky it\u2019d be fatal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to drop my little friend here,\u201d Y/N answered. Hoping that no other suits were on the way, \u201cyou\u2019ll shoot me as soon as I do so.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the suit called back, \u201cyou\u2019re seconds away from being surrounded.\u201d</p><p>Y/N steeled their nerves in preparation for what they were about to do. They loosened their grip on Spider-Man and pushed him forward, and at the same time jumped backwards off the building.</p><p>Time slowed to a crawl. The air grew hot and dry as blasts of energy flew overhead, missing them by inches.

As they stumbled, he anchored them to the ground with his webs.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time, pick fights with people you can actually win against,\u201d he teased, reaching up to rip away Y/N\u2019s mask.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Y/N began, before they were engulfed in flames. The web fluid melting away in the extreme heat. \u201cI think I pick fights just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d He stuttered before Y/N mercilessly shot waves of flame at him.</p><p>\u201cI have my ways,\u201d Y/N smirked. Commanding the flame to extinguish and shuddering as ice seemed to flood through their once fiery veins.</p><p>They checked to make sure their mask survived the blaze, and after confirming its presence, they approached the collapsed figure of Spider-Man.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at this point I wonder why I don\u2019t just start with that,\u201d Y/N mused as they pinned the hero to the ground. \u201cBut I doubt it matters to you. You would end up dead either way.\u201d</p><p>They rose their arm up in the air, preparing to plunge the knife down into his chest.</p><p>\u201cP-please,\u201d he gasped. Fear resonating in his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry kid, I don\u2019t have much of a choice,\u201d they swung down the knife, but the sound of a repulsor firing up interrupted them.</p><p>Y/N clutched the fallen hero and rolled, narrowly avoiding the energy blast fired off by the Iron Man suit that was directly behind them.</p><p>They jumped back to their feet and held the boy in front of them like a shield. Pressing the blade painfully against his windpipe. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d They shouted, \u201cdon\u2019t move or I slice his throat!\u201d</p><p>Y/N prayed that the suit was not just an AI, but in fact remotely controlled. Tony Stark would be more likely to listen to their demands than a cold and calculating machine.</p><p>Seconds ticked by as the suit planned it\u2019s next move. \u00a0Y/N breathed a sigh of relief as they watched the suit falter and lower it\u2019s outstretched arm.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, take it easy,\u201d the suit said mechanically, \u201cjust let him go.\u201d</p><p>Y/N backed towards the ledge, teetering on the edge of the building. They weren\u2019t too high up, but falling would hurt like hell. But if they were unlucky it\u2019d be fatal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to drop my little friend here,\u201d Y/N answered. Hoping that no other suits were on the way, \u201cyou\u2019ll shoot me as soon as I do so.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the suit called back, \u201cyou\u2019re seconds away from being surrounded.\u201d</p><p>Y/N steeled their nerves in preparation for what they were about to do. They loosened their grip on Spider-Man and pushed him forward, and at the same time jumped backwards off the building.</p><p>Time slowed to a crawl. The air grew hot and dry as blasts of energy flew overhead, missing them by inches. Panic began to sink in as their stomach swooped from beneath them.</p><p>But something broke their fall, a thin string of webbing caught to the very tips of their fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you get away!\u201d Spider-Man shouted from above, pulling Y/N upwards.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Spider-Boy!\u201d Y/N yelled back, \u201cyou\u2019ll see me again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t answer.

I&rsquo;ll probably update much less frequently, especially since this chapter was already halfway written when i posted the prologue</p><p>Hours of stakeout stiffened Y/N&rsquo;s muscles like iron cables. Brutal winds threatened to crack their resolve, but they stood firm on the roof of the marketplace. Finger artfully coiled over the trigger, ready to shoot should the famed web-slinger cross their path. Weeks of planning went into this, hours spent tracking the hero&rsquo;s path across the city. And every single day, he&rsquo;d cross this one street. Once at the beginning of his patrol, and again at the end.</p><p>Y/N assumed that this street was where the boy lived. But they believed it would be better to shoot him in costume. It would make a stronger statement, Y/N was theatrical like that. What shattered the hopes of millions more than the death of a hero? Would a random boy dead in his apartment accomplish the same thing? No.</p><p>The distant sound of web shooters alerted Y/N to his approach. They cocked the gun, and aimed exactly where his head would be. Just a few more seconds, five to be exact.</p><p>Five, they exhaled, preparing for the shot.</p><p>Four, they could hear the exclamations of people on the street below. &ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s Spider-Man!&rdquo;</p><p>Three, they could hear him approaching. The sound of web fluid exiting his shooters becoming louder, and louder.</p><p>Two, they could see him now. The light from street lamps illuminating him eerily.</p><p>One, he was right where they needed him to be. </p><p>They pulled the trigger, watching triumphantly as the bullet rushed towards him. He quickly turned, he had anticipated the shot. His gut warning him of the attacker. Shooting upwards, he pulled himself out of the way of the approaching bullet. Letting it crash uselessly into the neighboring building.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Y/N cursed. They never believed that the first attempt would yield any results, but they were so close.</p><p>And now Spider-Man was alerted to their presence. They darted behind a concrete wall. Hastily packing their weapons and double checking to ensure their mask was in place, confirming it was still covering the skin below their nose. The mask was decorated with the red and black webbed pattern that Spider-Man so famously sported. A bitter taste of irony, more theatrics on Y/N&rsquo;s part.</p><p>They had no intention of going toe-to-toe with Spider-Man. Not that they couldn&rsquo;t hold their own, but there was a risk of capture, and a risk that their employers would be compromised. A risk they weren&rsquo;t willing to take.</p><p>With everything in order they slung the bag containing the gun over their shoulder, sneaking carefully over to the fire escape. Spider-Man had just recovered his bearings and was now examining the building carefully, head pivoting as his eyes narrowed and enlarged mechanically.</p><p>Suddenly, he froze, he had spotted movement. Y/N&rsquo;s heart pounded as the fight-or-flight instinct kicked in, rooting them in place on the off chance he&rsquo;d move on</p><p>It was no use.</p><p>Spider-Man swung over and landed gracefully in front of Y/N. Examining them with interest.</p><p>&ldquo;I see you stole my look,&rdquo; he commented, nodding at their mask.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to say that I wasn&rsquo;t first?&rdquo; &nbsp;They fired back. Casually sliding their hand over to their hip, and tossing the bag aside.</p><p>&ldquo;You got me there,&rdquo; he answered, putting his hands up as if to surrender, but instead firing a round of webs at the assassin. </p><p>Y/N was smarter than that. They dodged the webs effortlessly and pulled out the concealed knife that was hidden on their thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty smart, Spider-Boy, trying to distract me with banter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Spider-Man,&rdquo; he answered indignantly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but your voice makes it seem as if you haven&rsquo;t even hit puberty yet. You may want to modify it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I already am,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;A pity,&rdquo; Y/N answered. Swinging their knife as he was preoccupied, managing to tear away a bit of fabric. &ldquo;Sometimes technology fails us, hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha ha, very funny,&rdquo; Spider-Man grumbled. Shifting into a fighting stance. &ldquo;Would you be so kind as to tell me why you just tried to shoot me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why of course, young sir,&rdquo; they replied haughtily. Blocking Spider-Man&rsquo;s punches and throwing a kick, which he blocked as well, grabbing their leg and throwing them aside. &ldquo;I just really don&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He said, shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;You actually believe me?&rdquo; Y/N laughed. They rose to their feet, and managed to get a few punches in before he could react. They elbowed his kidney and smirked as he curled into himself in pain. Their eyes visibly lighting up with held in laughter.</p><p>He soon recovered and drove his knee into Y/N&rsquo;s stomach, winding them. As they stumbled, he anchored them to the ground with his webs.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe next time, pick fights with people you can actually win against,&rdquo; he teased, reaching up to rip away Y/N&rsquo;s mask.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Y/N began, before they were engulfed in flames. The web fluid melting away in the extreme heat. &ldquo;I think I pick fights just fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; He stuttered before Y/N mercilessly shot waves of flame at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I have my ways,&rdquo; Y/N smirked. Commanding the flame to extinguish and shuddering as ice seemed to flood through their once fiery veins.</p><p>They checked to make sure their mask survived the blaze, and after confirming its presence, they approached the collapsed figure of Spider-Man.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at this point I wonder why I don&rsquo;t just start with that,&rdquo; Y/N mused as they pinned the hero to the ground. &ldquo;But I doubt it matters to you. You would end up dead either way.&rdquo;</p><p>They rose their arm up in the air, preparing to plunge the knife down into his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;P-please,&rdquo; he gasped. Fear resonating in his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry kid, I don&rsquo;t have much of a choice,&rdquo; they swung down the knife, but the sound of a repulsor firing up interrupted them.</p><p>Y/N clutched the fallen hero and rolled, narrowly avoiding the energy blast fired off by the Iron Man suit that was directly behind them.</p><p>They jumped back to their feet and held the boy in front of them like a shield.

He was so close, I felt his breath hit my lips.</i></p><p>That kiss with Peter replayed in my mind over and over again&hellip; I felt extremely restless, as I repeatedly tossed and turned around in my bed, squinting my eyes in the hope to sleep, but failed miserably.</p><p>The way his lips felt so soft on mine. The way his hands rested on my waist, pulling me closer. The taste of his lips. His soft curls falling on his face.<br/>I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about him&hellip;</p><p>I was soaked in sweat.<br/>I blinked open my eyes, instantly got out of my covers, grabbing a bottle of water, gulping it, pacifying my throat that felt dry like it was choked of ash. I checked the time on my phone, It was just 9 pm.</p><p>My plan of trying to sleep and ignore everything that happened today didn&rsquo;t go that well.</p><!-- more --><p>After all,&hellip; I just realized,&hellip; that I have feelings for him.

I should be the one saying sorry not him! He&rsquo;s still the one caring. Of course, I love him back, but I can&rsquo;t cheat him by telling lies. I should text him, or rather I should meet him and tell him the exact truth. I will explain everything to him, I am not the same person now, I am changed, also I didn&rsquo;t even do anything willingly, I was obligated to do it. Also, I actually haven&rsquo;t really succeeded in it, so Peter will understand&hellip; or at least I hope so.</p><p>I wiped away the tears that had fallen from my eyes involuntary while reading those messages. I quickly opened my keyboard and replied to his messages.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><b>Peter the dumbo(09:21 pm)</b></p><p><i><b>Y/N~</b> I&rsquo;m absolutely fine</i></p><p><i>\n\n<i><b>Y/N~</b></i>\n\n\u00a0I should be the one apologizing, </i><br/><i>not you\u00a0</i></p><p><i><b>P~</b> Thank god Y/n, ur okay!</i></p><p><b>P~</b>\u00a0<i>But wait, an apology?

And u r absolutely not a perv. Just get there.</i></p><p><i><b>P~</b> OK</i></p><p>&mdash;</p><p>I put my phone down and climbed out the window so that no one would know that I was leaving. With my full potential, I flew towards the park at a high altitude so that people wouldn&rsquo;t notice me. I landed behind a bush in the park and took a seat on the bench. The park was completely vacant, maybe because it&rsquo;s 09:26 pm, I groaned looking at the time. I came here in just 3 minutes, gotta wait some more minutes for Peter to come. I was tapping my feet restlessly, checking the time almost every second. Seems foolish, but what am I supposed to do? I heard some sort of noise behind my back, like a buzzing sound. I turned back to see a drone. I instantly stood up horrified. It wasn&rsquo;t a normal remote control drone, it was from my planet, the patterns engraved in its outer body clearly proved that. The drone flew and stopped in front of me, radiating a blue coloured light, and in a flash, a human hologram was displayed in front of my eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo&hellip;&hellip; Jonah?!?!&rdquo; my tongue-tied, making me bereft of speech, seeing that figure standing in front of me. <br/>&ldquo;Seems like you were expecting someone else&hellip;&rdquo; he puzzled, noticing me being not glad seeing his hologram. <br/>&ldquo;Ah&hellip; It&rsquo;s just the first time I&rsquo;ve seen you after a lot of years, so&hellip; it&rsquo;s really g-great&rdquo; I tried to develop a little fake smile.<br/>&ldquo;Is it so?!&rdquo; He said, sounding unsatisfied by my words. I squinted my eyes and raised an eyebrow, trying to pretend that I was unable to understand what he was saying, which was not actually the case. I heard another sound behind the bushes, but I couldn&rsquo;t see anyone there.<br/>&ldquo;I hope, you haven&rsquo;t forgotten the tasks you were assigned to do?!&rdquo; He questioned me diplomatically, making me look at his hologram again. <br/>&ldquo;Huh?! Uh..?! Wh-what are you trying to say?&rdquo; I fretted, stammering at every word, fake giggling at the end of the sentence as I slid the ring into my jacket&rsquo;s pocket hiding it from the view of his holographic cameras.</p><p>&ldquo;The Queen has given you enough time already, I&rsquo;m afraid she won&rsquo;t give you any more. Why haven&rsquo;t you contacted us, for 4 years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My transponder broke when I came here, so I was unable to contact you&rdquo; the only genuine thing I said till now to Jonah. <br/>&ldquo;But wait,&hellip; Queen?&rdquo; I hesitated.<br/>&ldquo;Yes, Princess Dorothea is now the crowned Queen and she won&rsquo;t be happy to know that you failed in getting the Ring!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I will try my best to get it really soon&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do it fast, because she&rsquo;s coming to see you and you definitely don&rsquo;t want to see their heads chopped&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Yeah, I will get it for her. Just ensure me you won&rsquo;t hurt them&rdquo;, I pleaded.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t reply and his holographic illusion turned off and that drone flew off.</p><p><i>She&rsquo;s coming for me. </i><br/><i>I&rsquo;ll have to give Dorothea that Ring.</i></p><p>I felt some hustle in the bush behind me. I turned to see Peter. He removed his mask, walking towards me. <br/>&ldquo;Pe&hellip; &rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;What the hell was that Y/n? You lied?! You are working for that person, you said you were against?! &rdquo; He chastised. His voice was so loud, I had never heard him so rough. He was hell angry. <br/>&ldquo;I-I,&hellip; listen, Peter, I wanted to tell you, that&rsquo;s why I called you and&hellip; &rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Come on Y/n, what did you expect?! I was an idiot, I believed you before Fury or Dr Strange.

I will explain everything to him, I am not the same person now, I am changed, also I didn\u2019t even do anything willingly, I was obligated to do it. Also, I actually haven\u2019t really succeeded in it, so Peter will understand\u2026 or at least I hope so.</p><p>I wiped away the tears that had fallen from my eyes involuntary while reading those messages.

With my full potential, I flew towards the park at a high altitude so that people wouldn\u2019t notice me. I landed behind a bush in the park and took a seat on the bench. The park was completely vacant, maybe because it\u2019s 09:26 pm, I groaned looking at the time. I came here in just 3 minutes, gotta wait some more minutes for Peter to come. I was tapping my feet restlessly, checking the time almost every second. Seems foolish, but what am I supposed to do? I heard some sort of noise behind my back, like a buzzing sound. I turned back to see a drone. I instantly stood up horrified. It wasn\u2019t a normal remote control drone, it was from my planet, the patterns engraved in its outer body clearly proved that. The drone flew and stopped in front of me, radiating a blue coloured light, and in a flash, a human hologram was displayed in front of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJo\u2026\u2026 Jonah?!?!\u201d my tongue-tied, making me bereft of speech, seeing that figure standing in front of me. <br>\u201cSeems like you were expecting someone else\u2026\u201d he puzzled, noticing me being not glad seeing his hologram. <br>\u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s just the first time I\u2019ve seen you after a lot of years, so\u2026 it\u2019s really g-great\u201d I tried to develop a little fake smile.<br>\u201cIs it so?!\u201d He said, sounding unsatisfied by my words. I squinted my eyes and raised an eyebrow, trying to pretend that I was unable to understand what he was saying, which was not actually the case. I heard another sound behind the bushes, but I couldn\u2019t see anyone there.<br>\u201cI hope, you haven\u2019t forgotten the tasks you were assigned to do?!\u201d He questioned me diplomatically, making me look at his hologram again. <br>\u201cHuh?! Uh..?! Wh-what are you trying to say?\u201d I fretted, stammering at every word, fake giggling at the end of the sentence as I slid the ring into my jacket\u2019s pocket hiding it from the view of his holographic cameras.</p><p>\u201cThe Queen has given you enough time already, I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t give you any more. Why haven\u2019t you contacted us, for 4 years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy transponder broke when I came here, so I was unable to contact you\u201d the only genuine thing I said till now to Jonah. <br>\u201cBut wait,\u2026 Queen?\u201d I hesitated.<br>\u201cYes, Princess Dorothea is now the crowned Queen and she won\u2019t be happy to know that you failed in getting the Ring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I will try my best to get it really soon\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it fast, because she\u2019s coming to see you and you definitely don\u2019t want to see their heads chopped\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Yeah, I will get it for her. Just ensure me you won\u2019t hurt them\u201d, I pleaded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply and his holographic illusion turned off and that drone flew off.</p><p><i>She\u2019s coming for me. </i><br><i>I\u2019ll have to give Dorothea that Ring.</i></p><p>I felt some hustle in the bush behind me. I turned to see Peter. He removed his mask, walking towards me. <br>\u201cPe\u2026 \u201d<br>\u201cWhat the hell was that Y/n? You lied?! You are working for that person, you said you were against?! \u201d He chastised. His voice was so loud, I had never heard him so rough. He was hell angry. <br>\u201cI-I,\u2026 listen, Peter, I wanted to tell you, that\u2019s why I called you and\u2026 \u201d<br>\u201cCome on Y/n, what did you expect?! I was an idiot, I believed you before Fury or Dr Strange. I challenged them that you were right?!\u201d He had tears in his eyes. <br>\u201cPlease Peter, I was trying to protect my planet.\u201d I tried to explain.<br>\u201cHow? How are you protecting the planet by giving that Ring to HER?! Tell me the truth! The complete, whole truth!\u201d He demanded, wearing his mask again.<br>\u201cOkay,\u2026 I will tell you the truth, all of it\u201d I responded, wearing the ring again, flying to a place devoid of any human interference and he too did swing to an abandoned building roof following me.</p><p><i>I was planning on explaining things to him calmly, but\u2026 It\u2019s even worse.</i></p></p>",

And u r absolutely not a perv. Just get there.</i></p><p><i><b>P~</b> OK</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>I put my phone down and climbed out the window so that no one would know that I was leaving. With my full potential, I flew towards the park at a high altitude so that people wouldn\u2019t notice me. I landed behind a bush in the park and took a seat on the bench. The park was completely vacant, maybe because it\u2019s 09:26 pm, I groaned looking at the time. I came here in just 3 minutes, gotta wait some more minutes for Peter to come. I was tapping my feet restlessly, checking the time almost every second. Seems foolish, but what am I supposed to do? I heard some sort of noise behind my back, like a buzzing sound. I turned back to see a drone. I instantly stood up horrified. It wasn\u2019t a normal remote control drone, it was from my planet, the patterns engraved in its outer body clearly proved that. The drone flew and stopped in front of me, radiating a blue coloured light, and in a flash, a human hologram was displayed in front of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJo\u2026\u2026 Jonah?!?!\u201d my tongue-tied, making me bereft of speech, seeing that figure standing in front of me. <br>\u201cSeems like you were expecting someone else\u2026\u201d he puzzled, noticing me being not glad seeing his hologram. <br>\u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s just the first time I\u2019ve seen you after a lot of years, so\u2026 it\u2019s really g-great\u201d I tried to develop a little fake smile.<br>\u201cIs it so?!\u201d He said, sounding unsatisfied by my words. I squinted my eyes and raised an eyebrow, trying to pretend that I was unable to understand what he was saying, which was not actually the case. I heard another sound behind the bushes, but I couldn\u2019t see anyone there.<br>\u201cI hope, you haven\u2019t forgotten the tasks you were assigned to do?!\u201d He questioned me diplomatically, making me look at his hologram again. <br>\u201cHuh?! Uh..?! Wh-what are you trying to say?\u201d I fretted, stammering at every word, fake giggling at the end of the sentence as I slid the ring into my jacket\u2019s pocket hiding it from the view of his holographic cameras.</p><p>\u201cThe Queen has given you enough time already, I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t give you any more. Why haven\u2019t you contacted us, for 4 years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy transponder broke when I came here, so I was unable to contact you\u201d the only genuine thing I said till now to Jonah. <br>\u201cBut wait,\u2026 Queen?\u201d I hesitated.<br>\u201cYes, Princess Dorothea is now the crowned Queen and she won\u2019t be happy to know that you failed in getting the Ring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I will try my best to get it really soon\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it fast, because she\u2019s coming to see you and you definitely don\u2019t want to see their heads chopped\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Yeah, I will get it for her. Just ensure me you won\u2019t hurt them\u201d, I pleaded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply and his holographic illusion turned off and that drone flew off.</p><p><i>She\u2019s coming for me. </i><br><i>I\u2019ll have to give Dorothea that Ring.</i></p><p>I felt some hustle in the bush behind me. I turned to see Peter. He removed his mask, walking towards me. <br>\u201cPe\u2026 \u201d<br>\u201cWhat the hell was that Y/n? You lied?! You are working for that person, you said you were against?! \u201d He chastised. His voice was so loud, I had never heard him so rough. He was hell angry. <br>\u201cI-I,\u2026 listen, Peter, I wanted to tell you, that\u2019s why I called you and\u2026 \u201d<br>\u201cCome on Y/n, what did you expect?! I was an idiot, I believed you before Fury or Dr Strange. I challenged them that you were right?!\u201d He had tears in his eyes. <br>\u201cPlease Peter, I was trying to protect my planet.\u201d I tried to explain.<br>\u201cHow? How are you protecting the planet by giving that Ring to HER?! Tell me the truth! The complete, whole truth!\u201d He demanded, wearing his mask again.<br>\u201cOkay,\u2026 I will tell you the truth, all of it\u201d I responded, wearing the ring again, flying to a place devoid of any human interference and he too did swing to an abandoned building roof following me.</p><p><i>I was planning on explaining things to him calmly, but\u2026 It\u2019s even worse.</i></p></p>",
