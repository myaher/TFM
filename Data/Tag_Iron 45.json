The boy had broken into a relieved smile, hugging him\nback with one arm around his broad frame, the other hidden behind his back.\nTony didn&rsquo;t seem to notice, patting Peter on the back and then holding him at\narms length, getting a good look at him. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s school been, kid?

He took a deep breath\nbefore lifting his eyes off the ground and to the other man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I was\npracticing some cool new flips and swings and I accidentally undershot how far\naway a building was.

too</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>for thor: </p><p>valkyrie lands the ship on earth days after the decimation, after he\u2019s killed thanos. he\u2019s numb from the losses he has already faced only to find his people have been halved yet again.\u00a0</p><p>he is their king. he settles the matter of settlement, the matter of trade and food, he negotiates and delegates and works day and night to protect them. but he never speaks to them, returning only in the dead of night to drink in loneliness.\u00a0</p><p>he loses himself more and more for the next years, meeting with the avengers even less. he speaks only with valkyrie, who settles matters on his behalf. she doesn\u2019t know how to help him, she couldn\u2019t help herself.\u00a0</p><p>the avengers find him like this, telling him they have time travel, they can undo the deaths. except they can\u2019t. unlike the majority of the universe, his loved ones, his people were slaughtered. when the dusted come back they will not be returned to him.\u00a0</p><p>he convinces himself, for their sakes, that this is a sweeter revenge. that undoing his life\u2019s work will harm thanos more severely than an axe in the chest.</p><p>then they win.\u00a0</p><p>he rejoices for all the rest of the fallen that have risen, truly and honestly, but half of his people, his brother, his friends are still dead. he\u2019s empty and broken, but not alone anymore.</p><p>somewhere in the heat of battle he realized how he had missed the avengers nearly as much as the dead, though they were right there waiting for him.\u00a0</p><p>he is reassured to know he\u2019s still worthy still of his own power, worthy of his rank among earth\u2019s mightiest heroes and now he wishes to be worthy of his people\u2019s trust. </p><p>the battle is won. revenge has been taken for his fallen but now he must take care of his living. he was not desperate for the crown, but he devotes himself to being a good king and a good man. learning the balance with some help from t\u2019challa. </p><p>though his heart is with his people, he is still an avenger always, and he loves his second family. they all build up asgardia together. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>for clint:</p><p>his shift is more simple, one he\u2019s been promising to make for years. he\u2019s retiring from the avengers business, actually this time. when he tells them all, they laugh. he does too.\u00a0</p><p>he moves his family to new york. his kids are older, and he wants them to get a good education. \n\nthe farm was safe but now it feels isolated.\n\nin new york there are plenty criminals and enemies lurking in alleyways, but there are many more heroes.</p><p>so he takes out a few muggers, it\u2019s just low level crime. no one is complaining and he\u2019s certainly not breaking <i>too much </i>of a sweat. </p><p>sure clint can\u2019t do this forever; he\u2019s getting older. but so is lila, and she\u2019s a damn good shot. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>for natasha:</p><p>in all honesty, she hasn\u2019t been a spy for a long time.\u00a0</p><p>she\u2019s already given away her box of secrets and lies don\u2019t come without a cost. she isn\u2019t inclined to pay any extra fees.</p><p>\u00a0for 5 years she sits in the compound, solving problems, big and small, keeping everyone together when they are universes apart. she clings tight to the ones she still has.</p><p>she tells steve that she can\u2019t lose <i>this</i>, can\u2019t lose being an avenger. but being an avenger was never something she could lose, she could only lose them.\u00a0</p><p>then scott appears, and they come together again. she\u2019s never been so relieved in her life.\u00a0</p><p>these last 5 years have made her a better leader and a teacher. she\u2019s not the strongest of gods, mutants, and super soldiers, but she\u2019s never had to be. her job was always people and she\u2019s damn good at it. </p><p>she is one of the originals. the avengers, the mightiest heroes of earth, trust her. as new kids bounce into the game on the heels of their older brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers, they don\u2019t hesitate to call aunt nat for help. peter parker, the suspiciously familiar new hawkeye, harley keener, kamala khan and so many other come through her open door. she teaches them.</p><p>she was born the black widow, and now she\u2019s learned to be natasha.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>for cap:</p><p>there\u2019s the problem of the soul stone. a sacrifice needs to be made. cap knows which one.</p><p>he looks tony in the eye and tells them that he will take care of it. they all blink at him. he tells them he will come home. they don\u2019t believe him, but he is stubborn.</p><p>he stares the ghost of his past in the face and he thinks that this must be a sign. he walks straight to the edge and he whispers \u201cyou can have him\u201d. the stone hears him.</p><p>his whole body is on fire for a second and he falls to his knees. they ache.</p><p>captain america went to the cliff, and steven grant rogers came home. he smiles, soul stone in hand.</p><p>bucky comes home, and hugs him tight, and steve laughs as he mutters \u201ci swear you were bigger\u201d</p><p>he becomes an activist, steve rogers was the fighter, the captain was a soldier. there\u2019s a difference. he\u2019s a leader, he works with nat often to help the new heroes.</p><p>steve has everything and everyone he needs right there. he hands the shield to sam with a grin, \u201cdon\u2019t lose it,\u201d he advises, \u201cbut one day you can hand it over.\u201d it\u2019s honest advice. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>for tony:</p><p>he comes home on a ship with nebula. she\u2019s a sweet woman, capable of such kindness but depraved of it.\u00a0</p><p>he screams at steve. they could have saved everyone if they had just listened to him. if steve had believed in him, trusted him, they wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u00a0</p><p>he faints, waking up to hear good and bad news. thanos is dead. they can\u2019t bring them back.\u00a0</p><p>that day, when he wakes up in the hospital room, pepper is there and so is may. he apologizes over and over. she shakes her head and hands him a picture frame. he remembers it. peter had rambled on about the picture, explaining that bunny ears were different than a peace sign. tony had only laughed, not having the heart to tell him he knew that.\u00a0</p><p>he stares at the picture, wanting to hug it tight so badly but not having the strength to tear his eyes away.\u00a0</p><p>finally he puts it in his lap, he calls harley and gets him and his sister the first flight to new york.\u00a0</p><p>he helps thor settle the refugees and integrate them into society. supplying them with whatever they need. though he tries to speak to him face to face, he finds himself speaking to valkyrie instead. he keeps trying.</p><p>harley is nearly an adult, and incredibly independant. he and his sister move to new york. tony helps him and his sister settle and sets them up at school. he hires harley as soon as he starts looking for a job.\u00a0</p><p>he keeps a close eye on nebula and rhodey. they are far away, too far. he can barely handle the distance. pepper very gently tells him he\u2019s clinging too tight but he finds himself anxiously worrying over their safety every time they go on a mission. he never figures out how to get rid of that.\u00a0</p><p>of course, he and pepper start a family. morgan is born. she\u2019s lovely and smart and too fast. she\u2019s growing up to fast. he\u2019s scared she\u2019ll be gone if he blinks too slowly.\u00a0</p><p>though they stay in new york and remain active in the community, the starks fade into the background like the rest of the avengers during those 5 years. it\u2019s hard to care for heroes and celebrities these days. natasha visits often, with a worn but genuine smile. rhodey spoils her rotten. nebula is oddly charming with her blunt nature. morgan loves her aunts and uncles.\u00a0</p><p>then steve comes, knocking down his door telling him that time travel is possible. tony disagrees and ends the conversation there.\u00a0</p><p>then he looks at peter\u2019s picture on the mantle; it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try.\u00a0</p><p>he figures it out of course, and the plan works. they retrieve the stones, and revive the fallen, but then comes the battle. this time, when he snaps his fingers, he falls limp, and wakes up in the same cot.\u00a0</p><p>peter is sitting there as he comes to, grinning, telling him they won.\u00a0</p><p>tony looks at his right arm, it\u2019s absolutely fried, he can barely feel it. there\u2019s far more damage, his heart is weaker. it\u2019s understandable, given all he\u2019s gone through. it\u2019s too weak for him to be flying around fighting petty crime lords.\u00a0</p><p>so he retires iron man. he goes back to stark industries and service. he begins experimenting with emergency medical nanotech, with shields and defensive measures for earth, with new medical care and programs for those in poverty. he builds armor for every new hero.\u00a0he\u2019s the futurist and these kids meant to be their future. he creates a program for the orphans and victims of the snap who didn\u2019t get their loved ones back.\u00a0</p><p>iron man has retired, but no one misses him. they watch as tony stark builds a suit of armor around the world.\u00a0</p>",

he&rsquo;s getting older. but so is lila, and she&rsquo;s a damn good shot. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>for natasha:</p><p>in all honesty, she hasn&rsquo;t been a spy for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>she&rsquo;s already given away her box of secrets and lies don&rsquo;t come without a cost. she isn&rsquo;t inclined to pay any extra fees.</p><p>&nbsp;for 5 years she sits in the compound, solving problems, big and small, keeping everyone together when they are universes apart. she clings tight to the ones she still has.</p><p>she tells steve that she can&rsquo;t lose <i>this</i>, can&rsquo;t lose being an avenger. but being an avenger was never something she could lose, she could only lose them.&nbsp;</p><p>then scott appears, and they come together again. she&rsquo;s never been so relieved in her life.&nbsp;</p><p>these last 5 years have made her a better leader and a teacher. she&rsquo;s not the strongest of gods, mutants, and super soldiers, but she&rsquo;s never had to be. her job was always people and she&rsquo;s damn good at it. </p><p>she is one of the originals. the avengers, the mightiest heroes of earth, trust her. as new kids bounce into the game on the heels of their older brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers, they don&rsquo;t hesitate to call aunt nat for help. peter parker, the suspiciously familiar new hawkeye, harley keener, kamala khan and so many other come through her open door. she teaches them.</p><p>she was born the black widow, and now she&rsquo;s learned to be natasha.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>for cap:</p><p>there&rsquo;s the problem of the soul stone. a sacrifice needs to be made. cap knows which one.</p><p>he looks tony in the eye and tells them that he will take care of it. they all blink at him. he tells them he will come home. they don&rsquo;t believe him, but he is stubborn.</p><p>he stares the ghost of his past in the face and he thinks that this must be a sign. he walks straight to the edge and he whispers &ldquo;you can have him&rdquo;. the stone hears him.</p><p>his whole body is on fire for a second and he falls to his knees. they ache.</p><p>captain america went to the cliff, and steven grant rogers came home. he smiles, soul stone in hand.</p><p>bucky comes home, and hugs him tight, and steve laughs as he mutters &ldquo;i swear you were bigger&rdquo;</p><p>he becomes an activist, steve rogers was the fighter, the captain was a soldier. there&rsquo;s a difference. he&rsquo;s a leader, he works with nat often to help the new heroes.</p><p>steve has everything and everyone he needs right there. he hands the shield to sam with a grin, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t lose it,&rdquo; he advises, &ldquo;but one day you can hand it over.&rdquo; it&rsquo;s honest advice. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>for tony:</p><p>he comes home on a ship with nebula. she&rsquo;s a sweet woman, capable of such kindness but depraved of it.&nbsp;</p><p>he screams at steve. they could have saved everyone if they had just listened to him. if steve had believed in him, trusted him, they wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess.&nbsp;</p><p>he faints, waking up to hear good and bad news. thanos is dead. they can&rsquo;t bring them back.&nbsp;</p><p>that day, when he wakes up in the hospital room, pepper is there and so is may. he apologizes over and over. she shakes her head and hands him a picture frame. he remembers it. peter had rambled on about the picture, explaining that bunny ears were different than a peace sign. tony had only laughed, not having the heart to tell him he knew that.&nbsp;</p><p>he stares at the picture, wanting to hug it tight so badly but not having the strength to tear his eyes away.&nbsp;</p><p>finally he puts it in his lap, he calls harley and gets him and his sister the first flight to new york.&nbsp;</p><p>he helps thor settle the refugees and integrate them into society. supplying them with whatever they need. though he tries to speak to him face to face, he finds himself speaking to valkyrie instead. he keeps trying.</p><p>harley is nearly an adult, and incredibly independant. he and his sister move to new york. tony helps him and his sister settle and sets them up at school. he hires harley as soon as he starts looking for a job.&nbsp;</p><p>he keeps a close eye on nebula and rhodey. they are far away, too far. he can barely handle the distance. pepper very gently tells him he&rsquo;s clinging too tight but he finds himself anxiously worrying over their safety every time they go on a mission. he never figures out how to get rid of that.&nbsp;</p><p>of course, he and pepper start a family. morgan is born. she&rsquo;s lovely and smart and too fast. she&rsquo;s growing up to fast. he&rsquo;s scared she&rsquo;ll be gone if he blinks too slowly.&nbsp;</p><p>though they stay in new york and remain active in the community, the starks fade into the background like the rest of the avengers during those 5 years. it&rsquo;s hard to care for heroes and celebrities these days. natasha visits often, with a worn but genuine smile. rhodey spoils her rotten. nebula is oddly charming with her blunt nature. morgan loves her aunts and uncles.&nbsp;</p><p>then steve comes, knocking down his door telling him that time travel is possible. tony disagrees and ends the conversation there.&nbsp;</p><p>then he looks at peter&rsquo;s picture on the mantle; it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to try.&nbsp;</p><p>he figures it out of course, and the plan works. they retrieve the stones, and revive the fallen, but then comes the battle. this time, when he snaps his fingers, he falls limp, and wakes up in the same cot.&nbsp;</p><p>peter is sitting there as he comes to, grinning, telling him they won.&nbsp;</p><p>tony looks at his right arm, it&rsquo;s absolutely fried, he can barely feel it. there&rsquo;s far more damage, his heart is weaker. it&rsquo;s understandable, given all he&rsquo;s gone through. it&rsquo;s too weak for him to be flying around fighting petty crime lords.&nbsp;</p><p>so he retires iron man. he goes back to stark industries and service. he begins experimenting with emergency medical nanotech, with shields and defensive measures for earth, with new medical care and programs for those in poverty. he builds armor for every new hero.&nbsp;he&rsquo;s the futurist and these kids meant to be their future. he creates a program for the orphans and victims of the snap who didn&rsquo;t get their loved ones back.&nbsp;</p><p>iron man has retired, but no one misses him. they watch as tony stark builds a suit of armor around the world.&nbsp;</p>",

You never felt the same way you did before that fateful day. You remembered it clearly, because you remembered the feeling so distinctly that it was still there weighing down in your chest. You were told the avengers would help, that it would feel normal because you were surrounded with a family that understood. But oh how wrong she was to believe it. A family, yes. That was for sure, but you definitely did not feel normal. </p><p>   It would be too much to say that you hated yourself, because you weren\u2019t the type of person to let something take over your life on a whole. It became a part of yourself that you kind of pushed to the side, the ignored section of yourself. But when helping the Avengers with missions that definitely changed. That was something you couldn\u2019t prevent, you love helping them, it made you feel better that you were using your abilities for good. </p><p>   There were multiple nights when she would lay awake in her bedroom at the compound, staring up at the blank ceiling with the window slightly ajar to let the cool air blow in. She thought about a lot of things, but the main topic on her mind was normally what it would be like if the powers hadn\u2019t have occurred to her. She\u2019d probably be in high school, with a group of friends or maybe a relationship. A crush at the very least. She\u2019d be stressing out over homework, but hey it\u2019s better than stressing about what mission you were gonna die on. It\u2019s a heavy topic, one that could bring tears to your eyes. How much were you really missing out on? </p><p>   \u201cHey, shifter.\u201d You got so used to the surprises that they became casual events for the two of you. The spider-boy and the shifter. He showed up to your window the most he could, but he had never seen you crying. Peter had seen you in a lot of states, on the brink of death even, but he had not once seen a tear fall from your eyes. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>   \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d You let out a light laugh. Not because you found the situation funny, but you found it amusing how you could let yourself cry over something you couldn\u2019t control. Peter on the other hand, as horrible as it sounded, wished you would cry sometimes. Because it showed him that you weren\u2019t going to keep anything inside.</p><p>   \u201cIt\u2019s not nothing if you\u2019re crying.\u201d Peter replied, climbing through the window and closing it behind him. He dropped onto the bed next to her, looking up at her with curious eyes. Eyes that showed her he would listen.</p><p>   \u201cYeah, maybe I\u2019m not as tough as I make myself out to be.\u201d Your eyes casted down, Peters fingers moving to interlocking with yours. He gave your hand a reassuring squeeze. \u201cI just feel like I\u2019m missing out on being a teenager, you know?\u201d</p><p>   \u201cYou\u2019d want to be a teenager over an avenger?\u201d Peter asked, eyebrows furrowed. To him, being an avenger had been more than a life goal to him. It had been a dream, one that so luckily came true. For you, it was cool but it was a full time thing. It wasn\u2019t something she had to work for, it was too normal.</p><p><br/></p><p>   \u201cYou only say that because you get to be both, Peter.\u201d You sighed, and Peter nodded slowly in agreement. At school, he got to be Peter Parker, and then he got to be Spider-Man too. He got both, but you got one thing all the time.</p><p>     \u201cWhat if you could be both?\u201d Peter looked like he had an idea, a small smile creeping up on his face. As much as he wanted to know that you could cry about things, that you would let yourself let go of things for a while. He hated seeing you upset, and he wanted to do something to help take that away.</p><p><br/></p><p>   \u201cI\u2019ve tried, I\u2019m doomed to be locked in this feeling of not being regular.\u201d You threw your head back into the pillow with a puff of air, slightly leaning it to the side to look at the brunette boy next to you. </p><p><br/></p><p>   \u201cNot for tonight you\u2019re not.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>   \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d You asked, a smile creeping upon your own face as you watched Peter suddenly sit up from your bed excitedly.</p><p><br/></p><p>   \u201cWe\u2019ll probably get in trouble, but tonight I\u2019m gonna take you to all the teenagery things there are in town.\u201d He grabbed your hands, pulling you up from the bed with a grin on his face. You looked at him intrigued, but you didn\u2019t want him to waste his time on you. He had been on patrol, so he was most likely tired and wanted to go home. </p><p><br/></p><p>   \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Pete.\u201d You shook your head as Peter held both your hands and stood in front of you. He stood taller, but not too much. </p><p><br/></p><p>    \u201cI want to.\u201d He promised, staring into your eyes. You smiled, before rolling your eyes and nodding. Peter was sweet and he cared about his friends more than anything. And that night you believed that not only did you get to experience some of the things with Peter, but you also got to experience the social part. Because that night you definitely developed a crush for the spider boy.</p><h2>-</h2><p><b><i>I\u2019m sorry this is so bad?

That was for sure, but you definitely did not feel normal. </p><p>   It would be too much to say that you hated yourself, because you weren\u2019t the type of person to let something take over your life on a whole.
