I don\u2019t think he would be in Ravenclaw or Slytherin, probably a Gryff or a Puff, but he\u2019s so young in the books and also not a POV character, so it\u2019s hard to get a good grasp on his core personality traits that could help determine a House.

I would accept either one of these in a story, and I don\u2019t really have a preference. I Sort her into Hufflepuff just to have a good mix with all the Houses for the Starklings, but I also think she would have been a close Gryffindor and the Sorting Hat took their time in Sorting her before making a final decision.</p><p>Sansa is like Arya, a mix between two Houses and a good fit for both, these two being Ravenclaw and Slytherin. As a Slytherin and one whose favorite character is Sansa, I Sort her into Slytherin. Plus as I mentioned with Arya, it gives a Stark to each House, with Rickon honestly going anywhere, but for my sake Gryffindor.</p><p>And then last, but so not least, Jon.

Sansa from a line of Starks (never concentrated into one House, but they would never be a Slytherin), finding herself under the tutelage of Charms Professor Baelish, and Jon, the scion of well-gossiped about affair between Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Snow, (a Stark cousin in fact) who doesn\u2019t want to follow in the footsteps of his family, but doesn\u2019t see a way out until he meets a Hufflepuff in need, Samwell Tarly.</p><p>But that\u2019s not the asoiaf/hp fusion series, and for that, I think Jon could be in any House, and probably Gryffindor just based on gut feeling.</p><p>Does that help?</p><p>(To be probably too nerdy, I also calculated where each Starkling would be with each other by year.

I had to get new ones to give you a fair chance.\u201d Finally he looked up and his eyes widened while his jaws dropped when his glance met hers.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow?\u201d Sansa straightened her back and lifted her chin. Her heartbeat had not fully slowed down yet and she could stil feel chicken skin covering her entire body. But with as much confidence as she could muster she walked towards the young man and held out her hand. \u201cI&rsquo;m Sansa Stark. I came here for the audition?\u201d</p><p>Jon kept on staring at her when he placed his hand in hers and shook it. \u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d He let out a deep breath and almost stumbled over his own feet when he walked backwards to continue getting everything ready. \u201cBut you already know that, else you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Strangely enough his clumsiness eased her nerves a little and Sansa\u2019s smile relaxed slightly while she watched how he placed the guitar on a chair and tried to guess the right height for the microphone. </p><p>His hands trembled a little while he searched for his sheet music. He was not exactly what Sansa had expected, but right now she was not sure if that was a bad or maybe more of a good thing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like the songs.\u201d Jon looked up and shrugged. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m looking for a singer and the sooner the better, but\u2026\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can say you don\u2019t wanna do this. It\u2019s not just me picking you, it\u2019s you picking me too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded and despite this being her audition, she got the feeling that she was the one having to make him feel at ease. \u201cI&rsquo;m sure everything will be fine.\u201d She walked towards the music stand and stared at the song, at the tones, at the lyrics. She had never been that good at reading and singing straight from the sheet, but with the right musical arrangement, she would hopefully not fail too badly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Jon walked to the seat in the corner and reached for his guitar. His fingers tuned the strings a little and then he nodded at her once more. \u201cDo you want something to drink first? Water? Tea?\u201d He swallowed, as if he all of sudden realized he should have asked her this before showing her the sheet music and grabbing his guitar.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll be fine. I drank something at home and warmed up my voice. I\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d Sansa smiled at him and then she stared at the sheet music again. \u201cYou\u2019ve picked an interesting title here.\u201d She cocked her head slightly. \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s just\u2026\u201d Jon paused for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s just a working title. If this works out between us, we can go over the text and title together and see if we have to change anything.\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cI meant it as a compliment, Jon. I like it. It stands out. It\u2019s different.\u201d She reached for the microphone and took it out of the stand. \u201cWhenever you start playing, I\u2019ll start singing.\u201d She smiled once more and waited.</p><p>For a few long seconds nothing happened, but then Jon\u2019s fingers started to move, started to play. The intro of his song echoed through the room, sounding so different from her ticking heals and her high pitched scream. In a way his song was mesmerizing and enchanting and Sansa almost forgot that she was supposed to add the lyrics.</p><p>But as soon as she started singing, she felt everything click and come together. She had no problem following the melody, perfectly harmonizing with the chords from the guitar. And even though the lyrics were brand new to her, she didn\u2019t stutter and didn\u2019t trip over words. This was what her voice was made for. This was what she had been looking for all this time.</p><p>When the song was eventually over she didn\u2019t want to open her eyes, but the silence slowly drove away the magical feeling and she could no longer live in a moment that had already passed. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnchanting.\u201d Jon finished her sentence and jumped up from his seat, his guitar still in his hands. \u201cThat was perfect. Absolutely perfect.\u201d He placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cThat was how I wanted the song to sound, how it sounded in my dreams\u2026\u201d He kissed her cheek, but as soon as he realized what he had done he stepped back. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, that was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s okay.\u201d Sansa smiled and she pressed the palm of her hand to his cheek. \u201cI recognize a perfect match when I feel one.\u201d She pecked his cheek too and then she stepped back. \u201cOne more song before we grab a coffee to talk over the details of our musical future?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded eagerly and he searched for another sheet of music. </p><p>But that one song turned into three and into ten. And eventually those ten songs turned into a lifetime of songs and love.</p>",

Jon Snow?\u201d She was just about to turn around when the lights all of a sudden turned on. A high pitched scream escaped her lips and Sansa didn\u2019t dare to look at the door opening behind her.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d A warm, deep voice interrupted the deafening silence and a man with a guitar case hurried past her towards the corner of the room. \u201cI promise I\u2019m usually never late.\u201d He started to unpack his backpack and case, plugging both the microphone and the guitar in. \u201cGhost, my dog, thought this was the perfect moment to feed himself my cables. I had to get new ones to give you a fair chance.\u201d Finally he looked up and his eyes widened while his jaws dropped when his glance met hers.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow?\u201d Sansa straightened her back and lifted her chin. Her heartbeat had not fully slowed down yet and she could stil feel chicken skin covering her entire body. But with as much confidence as she could muster she walked towards the young man and held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Sansa Stark. I came here for the audition?\u201d</p><p>Jon kept on staring at her when he placed his hand in hers and shook it. \u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d He let out a deep breath and almost stumbled over his own feet when he walked backwards to continue getting everything ready. \u201cBut you already know that, else you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Strangely enough his clumsiness eased her nerves a little and Sansa\u2019s smile relaxed slightly while she watched how he placed the guitar on a chair and tried to guess the right height for the microphone. </p><p>His hands trembled a little while he searched for his sheet music. He was not exactly what Sansa had expected, but right now she was not sure if that was a bad or maybe more of a good thing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like the songs.\u201d Jon looked up and shrugged. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m looking for a singer and the sooner the better, but\u2026\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can say you don\u2019t wanna do this. It\u2019s not just me picking you, it\u2019s you picking me too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded and despite this being her audition, she got the feeling that she was the one having to make him feel at ease. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be fine.\u201d She walked towards the music stand and stared at the song, at the tones, at the lyrics. She had never been that good at reading and singing straight from the sheet, but with the right musical arrangement, she would hopefully not fail too badly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Jon walked to the seat in the corner and reached for his guitar. His fingers tuned the strings a little and then he nodded at her once more. \u201cDo you want something to drink first? Water? Tea?\u201d He swallowed, as if he all of sudden realized he should have asked her this before showing her the sheet music and grabbing his guitar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I drank something at home and warmed up my voice. I\u2019m ready when you are.\u201d Sansa smiled at him and then she stared at the sheet music again. \u201cYou\u2019ve picked an interesting title here.\u201d She cocked her head slightly. \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Jon paused for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s just a working title. If this works out between us, we can go over the text and title together and see if we have to change anything.\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cI meant it as a compliment, Jon. I like it. It stands out. It\u2019s different.\u201d She reached for the microphone and took it out of the stand. \u201cWhenever you start playing, I\u2019ll start singing.\u201d She smiled once more and waited.</p><p>For a few long seconds nothing happened, but then Jon\u2019s fingers started to move, started to play. The intro of his song echoed through the room, sounding so different from her ticking heals and her high pitched scream. In a way his song was mesmerizing and enchanting and Sansa almost forgot that she was supposed to add the lyrics.</p><p>But as soon as she started singing, she felt everything click and come together. She had no problem following the melody, perfectly harmonizing with the chords from the guitar. And even though the lyrics were brand new to her, she didn\u2019t stutter and didn\u2019t trip over words. This was what her voice was made for. This was what she had been looking for all this time.</p><p>When the song was eventually over she didn\u2019t want to open her eyes, but the silence slowly drove away the magical feeling and she could no longer live in a moment that had already passed. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnchanting.\u201d Jon finished her sentence and jumped up from his seat, his guitar still in his hands. \u201cThat was perfect. Absolutely perfect.\u201d He placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cThat was how I wanted the song to sound, how it sounded in my dreams\u2026\u201d He kissed her cheek, but as soon as he realized what he had done he stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Sansa smiled and she pressed the palm of her hand to his cheek. \u201cI recognize a perfect match when I feel one.\u201d She pecked his cheek too and then she stepped back. \u201cOne more song before we grab a coffee to talk over the details of our musical future?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded eagerly and he searched for another sheet of music. </p><p>But that one song turned into three and into ten. And eventually those ten songs turned into a lifetime of songs and love.</p></p>",

She shared my hearth and hall, played with my own children. I fed her, dressed her, tried to make her a little less ignorant about the world, and how did she repay me for my kindness? She helped murder my son. When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. She is not dead &hellip; but before I am done with her, I promise you, <b>she will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss.</b>&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>The context is Cersei wanting to torture Sansa because Cersei thinks Sansa helped kill Joffrey. There\u2019s no romantic connotations. Besides the Stranger is one of the deities the Andals worship.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAnd the seventh face &hellip; the <b>Stranger</b> was neither male nor female, yet both, ever the outcast, the wanderer from far places, less and more than human, unknown and unknowable.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>SanSan isn\u2019t ever happening. Sandor has served his purpose in Sansa\u2019s story. His arc will come to an end at some point and I can assure you it doesn\u2019t involve him marrying Sansa.</p>",
