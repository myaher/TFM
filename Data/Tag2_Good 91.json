It hardly seemed the done thing, to say no.</i></p><p>Crowley\nwalked into the Hyacinth and Vine, up and into the little upstairs room that\nwas even more firm about being\u00a0<i>members only</i>\u00a0than the main part of the bar, and it\nwas a little past midnight at night. They\u2019d allowed him in, recognising him as\u00a0<i>Mr Fell\u2019s good friend<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\"><b>[2]</b></a></i>,\nand he hadn\u2019t knocked as he\u2019d entered the little bar, stepping in and looking\nfor the familiar ring of men, drinking their genteel drinks and chattering\nabout literature or music.</p><p>They\nmostly looked about the age of Aziraphale\u2019s vessel, in their fifties, sixties,\nbut one or two of the young ones was occasionally allowed upstairs, if he\nshowed himself to be particularly erudite&hellip;</p><p>Or\nparticularly playful.</p><p>This\nboy was one of them, some slip of a thing scarcely past twenty-five, a graduate\nfrom Cambridge, with thin legs and thin arms and a heart-shaped face, with\ncherry lips and a little waist. Half of Aziraphale\u2019s club was in love with him:\nhe mostly seemed interested in Aziraphale himself, although according to the\nangel, he\u2019d never made advances.\u00a0</p><p>Crowley\nhad been taught his name several times, and spitefully forgot it each time he saw\nhim.</p><!-- more --><p>There\nwas nothing\u00a0<i>wrong</i>\u00a0with the lad, per se, but Crowley disliked\nit, when he got too friendly with the angel, when he got him too bogged down in\ntalking about philosophy or music or ethics or romance&hellip; He was\u00a0<i>especially</i>\u00a0insufferable,\nasking Aziraphale about romance. Aziraphale always acted oblivious.</p><p>Initially,\nCrowley stepped forward, looked at the easy circle of men lounging in their\narmchairs or upon settees: Aziraphale was sitting, as he usually did, in an\nespecially plump, overstuffed couch made of green cloth.</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t see Crowley as he looked in. Conversation was going on around him,\ntalking about some new show, a musical one, but Aziraphale wasn\u2019t concentrating\non that, either: his gaze was angled downward, on Cherry Lips, who was on his\nknees between Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>Crowley\nstopped short, his wine glass clutched tightly in his hand.</p><p>He\u00a0tried\nto convince himself that he was mistaken, that the dark lenses of his\nsunglasses were playing a trick on him, that the boy had dropped an earring, or\na toy, or <i>something</i>. That wasn\u2019t it.\nIt was unmistakable, much as Crowley would like to mistake it as otherwise.</p><p>Cherry\nLips was kneeling, his pretty fingers splayed on Aziraphale\u2019s thighs<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>, and his mouth was wrapped\naround Aziraphale\u2019s cock, his head bobbing as he dragged his lips over the shaft,\nas he <i>sucked</i> at it. His pale skin,\nmuch paler than Crowley\u2019s \u2013 the stupid man looked <i>anaemic</i>, he was so damned pale \u2013 was flushed pink with exertion,\nand Aziraphale\u2014</p><p>One\nof Aziraphale\u2019s hands was gripping tightly at the arm of the sofa, but the\nother hand, the <i>other</i> of Aziraphale\u2019s\nlovely, plump, elegant hands, was hovering just over Cherry Lips\u2019 dark hair,\nlike he wanted to fist in it, and couldn\u2019t bear to actually muss him up. The\nfingers tightened into a fist, and he heard Aziraphale let out a soft moan.\nCrowley\u2019s whole body thrilled, with fury, and then with\u2026 another emotion. A hot\none that seemed to ripple beneath his skin. </p><p>He\nlooked\u2026</p><p>Crowley\nhad never seen Aziraphale have sex before.</p><p>He\nwasn\u2019t really aware, until now, that sex was on the table for an angel. It didn\u2019t\nseem right, for him to have sex, to have\u2014</p><p>To\n<i>enjoy</i> it!</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nrounded cheeks were flushed bright pink, and his eyes were screwed up tightly\nas he breathed heavily, and Cherry Lips reached up, the bastard, the little <i>bastard</i>, and dragged Aziraphale\u2019s hand\ninto his hair.</p><p>Crowley\nwas aroused. </p><p><i>Desperately</i> aroused. His cock was hard in his trousers, and he didn\u2019t even know what\nhe wanted, only that when he watched Aziraphale getting blown, he <i>wanted</i>: he wanted to grab Cherry Lips\nand hurt him, throw him out of the way, wanted to get on top of the angel and\ngrind against him, kiss him, <i>bite</i>\nhim, bite, bite, bite\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d\nAziraphale said, and Crowley heard Cherry Lips hum as Aziraphale looked down at\nhim, his fingers now entangled in the young man\u2019s dark locks, gripping at them\ntightly, and Cherry Lips moaned around his cock as if he enjoyed it, as if he\nenjoyed Aziraphale pulling his hair, repositioning his mouth to his pleasure\u2026\nCrowley imagined it. On his knees, in front of the angel, Aziraphale\u2019s hand\u2014 \u201cOh,\nmy dear, dear boy, you really mustn\u2019t\u2014 <i>oh</i>,\nmy dear, if you do that I really will\u2014\u201d</p><p>The\nnoise was wonderful.</p><p>A\nsoft noise, as much a sigh as a moan, and Aziraphale\u2019s head tipped back as he\nlet it out, as Cherry Lips swallowed him down, and Crowley watched the way he\ndid it, watched the way he leaned back on his heels, gave Aziraphale a\nlong-lashed look from softly brown eyes, and said, \u201cDid you like it, <i>Ezra</i>?\u201d</p><p>Ezra!</p><p><i>Ezra!</i></p><p>Calling\nhim by his <i>forename</i>, the little\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\nwas\u2014 Lovely,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little awkwardly, and Cherry Lips smiled at him,\nmoving to stand as Aziraphale hurriedly tucked away the evidence of his making\nan effort, and then he said, because it was Aziraphale, \u201cthank you, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngonna get a drink,\u201d Cherry Lips purred. \u201cCan I get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nno, no, I hardly think so, I\u2019ve my tipple right here,\u201d Aziraphale said,\ngesturing to his sherry, and Cherry Lips turned on his heels. When he saw\nCrowley, he smiled, and it was the smile that did it. A superior smile, a\nlittle smug quirk of his lips, the chin raising: he smiled at Crowley as if he\u2019d\nwon something, as if he\u2019d taken something Crowley wanted.</p><p>Crowley\nsipped at his wine, and moved directly forward.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nAziraphale said, as Crowley dropped heavily into his lap. \u201c<i>Anthony</i>, I didn\u2019t realize you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nkissed him savagely, licked into the angel\u2019s mouth and tasted nothing but the\nsweetness of his cherry, and Aziraphale let out a dizzy noise, one of his hands\nsettling clumsily on Crowley\u2019s lower back.</p><p>He\nlooked hazy when Crowley pulled back, his eyes defocused, his lips parted. \u201cIs\nthat\u2014 Is that how we\u2019re greeting one another now, my dear?\u201d he asked in a low\nvoice, too out of it to be truly stern.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>ss<i>,\u201d\n</i>Crowley said. </p><p>\u201cFar\nbe it from me to argue,\u201d Aziraphale said, and opened his mouth to continue, but\nCrowley squeezed his hips with his knees, and he kissed him again, wound his\nfingers in Aziraphale\u2019s wan curls and kissed him until his jaw hurt.</p><p>He\nmade sure Cherry Lips saw.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> And, Crowley often thought, when he was feeling particularly\nbitter, rightly so. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> How little they knew!</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> The <i>bastard</i> was a\nflautist, and he had elegant fingers for the purpose, that looked as if they\u2019d\nbeen made of painted porcelain. Crowley, not ordinarily an especially violent\ndemon, always felt they looked satisfying to break. </p>",

Aziraphale always acted oblivious.</p><p>Initially,\nCrowley stepped forward, looked at the easy circle of men lounging in their\narmchairs or upon settees: Aziraphale was sitting, as he usually did, in an\nespecially plump, overstuffed couch made of green cloth.</p><p>He\ndidn\u2019t see Crowley as he looked in. Conversation was going on around him,\ntalking about some new show, a musical one, but Aziraphale wasn\u2019t concentrating\non that, either: his gaze was angled downward, on Cherry Lips, who was on his\nknees between Aziraphale\u2019s.</p><p>Crowley\nstopped short, his wine glass clutched tightly in his hand.</p><p>He\u00a0tried\nto convince himself that he was mistaken, that the dark lenses of his\nsunglasses were playing a trick on him, that the boy had dropped an earring, or\na toy, or <i>something</i>. That wasn\u2019t it.\nIt was unmistakable, much as Crowley would like to mistake it as otherwise.</p><p>Cherry\nLips was kneeling, his pretty fingers splayed on Aziraphale\u2019s thighs<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>, and his mouth was wrapped\naround Aziraphale\u2019s cock, his head bobbing as he dragged his lips over the shaft,\nas he <i>sucked</i> at it. His pale skin,\nmuch paler than Crowley\u2019s \u2013 the stupid man looked <i>anaemic</i>, he was so damned pale \u2013 was flushed pink with exertion,\nand Aziraphale\u2014</p><p>One\nof Aziraphale\u2019s hands was gripping tightly at the arm of the sofa, but the\nother hand, the <i>other</i> of Aziraphale\u2019s\nlovely, plump, elegant hands, was hovering just over Cherry Lips\u2019 dark hair,\nlike he wanted to fist in it, and couldn\u2019t bear to actually muss him up. The\nfingers tightened into a fist, and he heard Aziraphale let out a soft moan.\nCrowley\u2019s whole body thrilled, with fury, and then with\u2026 another emotion. A hot\none that seemed to ripple beneath his skin. </p><p>He\nlooked\u2026</p><p>Crowley\nhad never seen Aziraphale have sex before.</p><p>He\nwasn\u2019t really aware, until now, that sex was on the table for an angel. It didn\u2019t\nseem right, for him to have sex, to have\u2014</p><p>To\n<i>enjoy</i> it!</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s\nrounded cheeks were flushed bright pink, and his eyes were screwed up tightly\nas he breathed heavily, and Cherry Lips reached up, the bastard, the little <i>bastard</i>, and dragged Aziraphale\u2019s hand\ninto his hair.</p><p>Crowley\nwas aroused. </p><p><i>Desperately</i> aroused. His cock was hard in his trousers, and he didn\u2019t even know what\nhe wanted, only that when he watched Aziraphale getting blown, he <i>wanted</i>: he wanted to grab Cherry Lips\nand hurt him, throw him out of the way, wanted to get on top of the angel and\ngrind against him, kiss him, <i>bite</i>\nhim, bite, bite, bite\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d\nAziraphale said, and Crowley heard Cherry Lips hum as Aziraphale looked down at\nhim, his fingers now entangled in the young man\u2019s dark locks, gripping at them\ntightly, and Cherry Lips moaned around his cock as if he enjoyed it, as if he\nenjoyed Aziraphale pulling his hair, repositioning his mouth to his pleasure\u2026\nCrowley imagined it. On his knees, in front of the angel, Aziraphale\u2019s hand\u2014 \u201cOh,\nmy dear, dear boy, you really mustn\u2019t\u2014 <i>oh</i>,\nmy dear, if you do that I really will\u2014\u201d</p><p>The\nnoise was wonderful.</p><p>A\nsoft noise, as much a sigh as a moan, and Aziraphale\u2019s head tipped back as he\nlet it out, as Cherry Lips swallowed him down, and Crowley watched the way he\ndid it, watched the way he leaned back on his heels, gave Aziraphale a\nlong-lashed look from softly brown eyes, and said, \u201cDid you like it, <i>Ezra</i>?\u201d</p><p>Ezra!</p><p><i>Ezra!</i></p><p>Calling\nhim by his <i>forename</i>, the little\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\nwas\u2014 Lovely,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little awkwardly, and Cherry Lips smiled at him,\nmoving to stand as Aziraphale hurriedly tucked away the evidence of his making\nan effort, and then he said, because it was Aziraphale, \u201cthank you, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngonna get a drink,\u201d Cherry Lips purred. \u201cCan I get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nno, no, I hardly think so, I\u2019ve my tipple right here,\u201d Aziraphale said,\ngesturing to his sherry, and Cherry Lips turned on his heels. When he saw\nCrowley, he smiled, and it was the smile that did it. A superior smile, a\nlittle smug quirk of his lips, the chin raising: he smiled at Crowley as if he\u2019d\nwon something, as if he\u2019d taken something Crowley wanted.</p><p>Crowley\nsipped at his wine, and moved directly forward.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nAziraphale said, as Crowley dropped heavily into his lap. \u201c<i>Anthony</i>, I didn\u2019t realize you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nkissed him savagely, licked into the angel\u2019s mouth and tasted nothing but the\nsweetness of his cherry, and Aziraphale let out a dizzy noise, one of his hands\nsettling clumsily on Crowley\u2019s lower back.</p><p>He\nlooked hazy when Crowley pulled back, his eyes defocused, his lips parted. \u201cIs\nthat\u2014 Is that how we\u2019re greeting one another now, my dear?\u201d he asked in a low\nvoice, too out of it to be truly stern.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>ss<i>,\u201d\n</i>Crowley said. </p><p>\u201cFar\nbe it from me to argue,\u201d Aziraphale said, and opened his mouth to continue, but\nCrowley squeezed his hips with his knees, and he kissed him again, wound his\nfingers in Aziraphale\u2019s wan curls and kissed him until his jaw hurt.</p><p>He\nmade sure Cherry Lips saw.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> And, Crowley often thought, when he was feeling particularly\nbitter, rightly so. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> How little they knew!</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> The <i>bastard</i> was a\nflautist, and he had elegant fingers for the purpose, that looked as if they\u2019d\nbeen made of painted porcelain. Crowley, not ordinarily an especially violent\ndemon, always felt they looked satisfying to break. </p></p>",
