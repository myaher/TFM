And she said \u201ceveryone can join this, but of course who wants\u201d anddd guess what, I was one of them! I was only person who joined to this show of my class. Then she gave me a paper and I saw your song, blank space! <br/>\nThe show day was coming up so fast. I remembered, I was so excited and can not wait it. <br/>\nBut the karaoke was started! My teacher calling to the other students. I was reeeeally so excited, my legs were trembling so hard. I was so scared. But then I thought \u201cif Taylor was there, I know that she was gonna say to me that she wants to be calm down to me.\u201d Then teacher invited me to the stage, and somehow the song started to play! And I started to singing. Eeeeeeveryone was looking at me. My friends, all the teachers, and there was a guy being there who was taking a picture or taking a video?!? At the end of my show, Everyone applauded me and I went to the my place quietly. I was feel so relaxed. That feels so good to me. I just could not sing it aloud when singing. But you know, I was proud of myself so much. I knew that if @taylorswift was there, we\u2019ll be so proud of me together. <br/>\nThen, a few days later, I learned that I was 3rd of this show. I was so shocked, I didn\u2019t wait this. Then my teacher called me to the stage and she gave me a present. The present was a headphone. It looks so pretty and I\u2019m already using! <br/>\nI just want to say that, thanks for being in my life @taylorswift you are an amazing sister I\u2019ve ever seen. Even if I sad, you make me so so better. And I hope that you\u2019re having a good time. Because you are deserve to be happy. Love you! <br/>\n-Rana\ud83d\udc97</p>",
