        "body": "<p>Since a good portion of my enjoyment comes from comparison to the game, massive spoilers for both follow!

And it ended on exactly the reveal that I wanted the game to end on. That alone would have made the movie an improvement over the game, but there\u2019s also so much more I enjoyed.</p><p><b>Story</b></p><p>The story was definitely inspired by the game, and included several of the same locations that the game did, but was sufficiently different enough that everything felt like a surprise.</p><p>The game focuses on the mystery of R, and the majority of it is figuring out what exactly this substance is and how it is planned to be used before Tim and Pikachu must save the day.</p><p>The movie? Really focused on Harry\u2019s disappearance. R is present and important, but it\u2019s not the focus.</p><p>They changed up the villain and the villain plot as well, which was a nice surprise, and is something I\u2019ll get into more detail with later on.<br/></p><p>And Mewtwo had a much larger role in the movie than in the game. As I love Mewtwo, I was very pleased. Movie Mewtwo had a different personality to Game Mewtwo, but I was fine with that. Movie Mewtwo seemed like a mature Mewtwo that showed that whatever happened in the past (many people say it\u2019s the same one from Mewtwo Strikes Back, but since he seems to have learned that humans aren\u2019t evil from Harry\u2019s actions, I doubt it\u2019s the case), he\u2019s grown from it. He forgives humans, and is actually delighted to help out in the end. I don\u2019t know - when stoic characters smile it just makes me so happy and that happened in the climax.</p><p>Of course, one thing that bothered me is that we didn\u2019t see much of the effects of people being merged with their Pokemon. Yeah, we saw Harry/Pikachu throughout the movie, but that\u2019s it. No looking at even the main girl and her Psyduck, just that she didn\u2019t enjoy the experience.<br/></p><p><b>Characters</b></p><p>I guess I already went into this a bit with Mewtwo, but the characters have changed, and it\u2019s only a good thing.</p><p>Tim in the games was pretty boring. Here, there\u2019s no doubt that he is just a regular guy, not an action hero. I love how awkward he is in just about everything, except, of course, Pokemon knowledge when he finally needs it. Also, his personal issues with his dad struck a bit deep with me, because I can tangentially relate. Not going to go into personal details, and it\u2019s not nearly as bad as Tim\u2019s issues, but I could definitely empathize.</p><p>The girl (can\u2019t remember her name)&hellip; was she in the game? Was she the Fletchling girl? Some composite character of her, Meiko, and Emilie? (I only know their names since I put them in my game review). She was okay in the movie, but didn\u2019t seem to drive the story forward as much. She mostly seemed to be exposition (there\u2019s a mystery to solve), but honestly I think if she were removed, nothing of value would change. Psyduck was great, though, so there\u2019s that.</p><p>Although speaking of, what was wrong with PNN? Why did they change it to CNM? What does that even mean? I know PNN was Pokemon News Network; is CNM Cable News&hellip; about Monsters? They already had a functional fake news channel, so I don\u2019t know why they changed it and <i>based it on the same real-life news channel</i>. Like if it was VULPIX News or something maybe it would feel more valid.<br/></p><p>There were a few characters who did nothing and just appeared to appear. Like the guy with the Snubbull at the detective agency, and the bartender with the Ludicolo at Hi-Hat Cafe. Okay, the latter wasn\u2019t that important in the game, either, but could have done more here, I feel.</p><p>But then there\u2019s Pikachu, who just is perfect. He\u2019s really the main character and has a great arc where he bonds with Tim. It\u2019s somewhat unfortunate that it seems this bond broke a bit when he turned back into Harry, but it makes sense: if your pet, even if it was a talking pet, suddenly turned out to be your missing family member, things would be awkward for a bit.</p><p>I do wish we had seen more of the pair at the end, though. I\u2019m pretty sure the main personality of Pikachu came from Harry, but we don\u2019t see that very much at the end. Both Harry and Tim are awkward around one another when they had clicked so well when Harry was a Pikachu.</p><p><b>The Pokemon</b></p><p>I\u2019ll be honest: when I first saw the first trailer, I wasn\u2019t too happy. The Pokemon in this movie are creepy. But as I watched, they grew on me. When Main Girl said at the beginning \u201cAll Pokemon are adorable\u201d I laughed a little because they\u2019re not in this movie, but as it went on, I started to agree with her. Even if they don\u2019t look adorable, they act adorable, even if they\u2019re mutated ninja frogs trying to kill the main characters.</p><p><b>Why I really liked it</b></p><p>Longtime followers of this blog may notice I have a tendency to connect current happenings to things I made up as a kid. That happened again in this movie.</p><p>So, in the movie, the main villain has a degenerative disease and wants to use Pokemon to cure it - specifically he wants to merge himself with Mewtwo in order to have a superior body (and then wants everyone else to follow in his footsteps with their Pokemon).</p><p>Well, the same character I have noticed has an identical story arc to Gladion back in Sun/Moon (they both have a missing parent, an evil scientist other parent, and both run away with one-of-three genetic experiment Pokemon who are based on Arceus in some way), has a few similarities to this guy.</p><p>Namely: Jake from my neverending fanfic had a degenerative brain disease that wasn\u2019t curable. But, he was able to remain alive by merging his consciousness with a Mewtwo.</p><p>&hellip;To be fair, this fanfic has been continually getting updates and new storylines for 16 years, so if a plot exists, there\u2019s probably a similar plot in my story. And the fact that it takes place in the Pokemon world just makes these similarities more likely. Doesn\u2019t make it any less exciting, though.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Overall, I really enjoyed it, and would love to see more. They took elements from the game, but weren\u2019t too loyal, and that worked out really well. I love the main characters and the main story, and of course that it has a pretty similar story to one of mine.<br/></p>",

You have been warned.</p><p>Although looking at what I wrote, it\u2019s more of a gushing ramble than a review. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>I\u2019ll start by quoting myself from when I finished the game: <a href=\"https://ladala99.tumblr.com/post/172430390949/detective-pikachu-the-end\">\u201cThe movie better tie itself up better than the game did.\u201d</a></p><p>Oh, it did. And it ended on exactly the reveal that I wanted the game to end on. That alone would have made the movie an improvement over the game, but there\u2019s also so much more I enjoyed.</p><p><b>Story</b></p><p>The story was definitely inspired by the game, and included several of the same locations that the game did, but was sufficiently different enough that everything felt like a surprise.</p><p>The game focuses on the mystery of R, and the majority of it is figuring out what exactly this substance is and how it is planned to be used before Tim and Pikachu must save the day.</p><p>The movie? Really focused on Harry\u2019s disappearance. R is present and important, but it\u2019s not the focus.</p><p>They changed up the villain and the villain plot as well, which was a nice surprise, and is something I\u2019ll get into more detail with later on.<br></p><p>And Mewtwo had a much larger role in the movie than in the game. As I love Mewtwo, I was very pleased. Movie Mewtwo had a different personality to Game Mewtwo, but I was fine with that. Movie Mewtwo seemed like a mature Mewtwo that showed that whatever happened in the past (many people say it\u2019s the same one from Mewtwo Strikes Back, but since he seems to have learned that humans aren\u2019t evil from Harry\u2019s actions, I doubt it\u2019s the case), he\u2019s grown from it. He forgives humans, and is actually delighted to help out in the end. I don\u2019t know - when stoic characters smile it just makes me so happy and that happened in the climax.</p><p>Of course, one thing that bothered me is that we didn\u2019t see much of the effects of people being merged with their Pokemon. Yeah, we saw Harry/Pikachu throughout the movie, but that\u2019s it. No looking at even the main girl and her Psyduck, just that she didn\u2019t enjoy the experience.<br></p><p><b>Characters</b></p><p>I guess I already went into this a bit with Mewtwo, but the characters have changed, and it\u2019s only a good thing.</p><p>Tim in the games was pretty boring. Here, there\u2019s no doubt that he is just a regular guy, not an action hero. I love how awkward he is in just about everything, except, of course, Pokemon knowledge when he finally needs it. Also, his personal issues with his dad struck a bit deep with me, because I can tangentially relate. Not going to go into personal details, and it\u2019s not nearly as bad as Tim\u2019s issues, but I could definitely empathize.</p><p>The girl (can\u2019t remember her name)\u2026 was she in the game? Was she the Fletchling girl? Some composite character of her, Meiko, and Emilie? (I only know their names since I put them in my game review). She was okay in the movie, but didn\u2019t seem to drive the story forward as much. She mostly seemed to be exposition (there\u2019s a mystery to solve), but honestly I think if she were removed, nothing of value would change. Psyduck was great, though, so there\u2019s that.</p><p>Although speaking of, what was wrong with PNN? Why did they change it to CNM? What does that even mean? I know PNN was Pokemon News Network; is CNM Cable News\u2026 about Monsters? They already had a functional fake news channel, so I don\u2019t know why they changed it and <i>based it on the same real-life news channel</i>. Like if it was VULPIX News or something maybe it would feel more valid.<br></p><p>There were a few characters who did nothing and just appeared to appear. Like the guy with the Snubbull at the detective agency, and the bartender with the Ludicolo at Hi-Hat Cafe.
