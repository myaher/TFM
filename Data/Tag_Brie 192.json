The illusion was always that it was safe, warmed by a Texan sun and a friendly hello from the commoners that have lived in Lakewood all their lives. But they learned their lesson with the kicking up of dust from a lone biker, to the cartels that moved like packs of coyotes along one another: Lakewood is a <i>death sentence</i>. Those who choose to live here take the responsibility that they might not live to see the sun set the next day. Families in power all want to dominate the town, a prime place for business on the border, while dodging the impending presence of FBI agents in town. Who can trust who? A good versus evil with the underlining tone that <i>everyone</i> is corrupted. Now, only one question remains: which side do you stand on?<br><br><a href=\"https://thisislakewood.tumblr.com/navigation\">Mobile Navigation</a><br><b>Opened since December 2018.</b>",

A mother with secrets withheld, an absent father who didn\u2019t pay them much mind and left them to fend for themselves. Blood is thicker than water. A saying the Almeida family held strongly to, taught their descendants during incubation in their mother\u2019s womb. Perfect, eerily so, an adjective to describe them from an outsider\u2019s perspective. Two daughters, both beautiful in their individual ways, mirror opposites of their parents. Manners well-taught and respected, brilliance beyond compare, a healthy competition that only caused a ridge between siblings. Sisters who shared everything but kinship and mutual understanding. Yin and yang, two sides of a coin. Preference and favoritism evident with each parent and one of the children. A shadow Charlotte intentionally refused to allow herself to be eclipsed by, her sister everything she wanted to be\u2013a raven-haired beauty with doe-eyes and charm that drew everyone in. A ray of light that walked among the darkness. A happy, perfect little family with Charlotte their little black sheep.</small></p><p><small>Unbeknownst to her, modest, humble, people too flocked to her for friendship, advice, a warmth about her that radiated inviting. Smile that lit up her face, crinkling eyes and contagious. A natural athlete that participated in sports, surprising that her parents agreed, the commitment to being her best self mentally and physically. Even more compelling to others that she preferred books and stories to the desire of putting herself out there 100%, preferred writing and going into the very depths of her imagination on paper. A talent hidden from her family\u2013stories were meant for children, even if the family had quite a story of their own.</small></p><p><small>\u2018Love\u2019 wasn\u2019t in the dictionary when it came to a drug cartel family. As the years went by she molded herself into her own individual, accepted her fate as the girl with a dark past. A self-awareness she developed as she grew, as she realized the life that waited for her wasn\u2019t deemed normal to the peers that surrounded her. Family dinners that were brief and discussed the simple things like school and work, not about transactions and deals. Discussions and problems that were artificial that could be solved with money. Charlotte fit the girl-next-door stereotype to a T. A role she soon grew into, kind hearted, sincere, and with a wisdom beyond her years. She could read people and their energies even when she was an infant, and didn\u2019t hesitate to call them out. Growing up in Lakewood, Texas, a small town where everyone knew everyone and their families before them. Familial history, the cream of the crop of the elite, stories she ate up every day of her life and wrote her own renditions of. Growing up, Charlotte\u2019s life was influenced by her family\u2013her sharp-mind and attitude, not at all the Southern Bell a Texan gal could become.</small></p><p><small>A familial bloodline tainted by their ancestors, lives led by crime\u2013mobsters and drug dealers. History wasn\u2019t something Charlotte wanted to be doomed to repeat. The crime life never appealed to her, never seemed a plausible solution to fill any void she felt in her otherwise perfect life, despite her father\u2019s attempted persuasion which she found half-heartedly repeated even at a young age. Almost as a second thought, given that her brother felt the same way she did and he was getting nowhere with his firstborn. But as time went on, Charlotte\u2019s curiosity grew, the incessant itch at the back of her mind and nimble fingers to find out more and write about the story of the past. It seemed thrilling, the way her father gave her the tidbits and scoops. Like a secret she\u2019d eventually be let in on when she got older.</small></p><p><small>She found people in Lakewood to teach her how to shoot, preferred the rifle over a handgun, and learned how to lie and bend the truth from careful observation of her own parents. Family history shaped Charlotte to crave more information, adventure, and journalism was something she found herself pursuing. Somehow, someway, her independent attitude caught the eye of the boy next door. A fairy-tale, romcom sort of name that went with his brilliant smile that crinkled bright blues\u2013Logan Legend. \u00a0A friendship that had grown out of habit and repetition, her ability to keep up with him something impressionable for children their age. Overtime, Charlotte grew dependent on her friendship, and as years passed, passion gave way to love. He was her influence, her strongest support system, even if he would rip her heart out and stomp on it by leaving to pursue a life of his own.</small></p><p><small>And when he left to enlist for the Army, the first 24 hours of recovery were crucial\u2013the frantic calls, the voicemails that convey anger, confusion, betrayal, depression, eagerness to please, and bargaining. Anything to convince Logan to return, anything to beg him to come and help her collect the pieces of herself that had been shattered. That first day turned into two and weeks turned into months. As the years rolled by Charlotte finally made a decision for herself\u2013to move on and not look back. Charlotte was stuck at a crossroads then, of age to learn everything she\u2019d craved but simultaneously rooted to the potential she held to forge her own path. A decision she made ultimately based on loyalty and the desire to prove her worth, the very thing her family didn\u2019t want for her. It was how they\u2019d been molded and raised, she didn\u2019t know any better. And with that Charlotte used the hole in her heart to push herself to move on too and forge her path.</small></p><p><small>Following Logan\u2019s example, Charlotte left Lakewood to discover the possibilities that lay over the ocean\u2013the world that existed just beyond, their stories left untold. A life Charlotte was envious for, her escape was the world outside her home, a world where she could pretend she wasn\u2019t associated with the life of deceit and chaos. It was then that Charlotte decided to try to learn how live on her own. Without her family to fend and look after her, the time for tears faded into nonexistence. No one was there to wipe them from plump cheeks, no one was there to tell her it was going to be alright. At least, Logan wasn\u2019t able to. A life Charlotte was envious for, her escape was the world outside her home, a world where she could pretend she wasn\u2019t associated with the life of deceit and chaos. A civilian journalist, Charlotte was sent overseas to cover the stories of a unit she\u2019d never met.</small></p><p><small>There she met Piper Sinclair, a woman who she immediately admired, whose strength exuded out like a breath of fresh air. A role model Charlotte hadn\u2019t realized she was missing. Tragedy then would bring the two together during the short time Charlotte was there. Night fell, and Charlotte awoke to chaos and the smell of gunpowder. Among the debris she found Piper, and the two soon realized they were the only survivors. The minute they were able to Charlotte convinced Piper to come to Lakewood with her, a desire to leave the tragedy behind, to run away again but this time back home. It was that moment that Charlotte knew she needed to learn how to protect herself, to fight back, and she joined the Almeida family business, finally, along with Piper. Piper who taught her everything she needed to know in order to keep up with the cartel business, including opening their own shooting range.</small></p><p><small>Loss, tragedy, it\u2019s something Charlotte hadn\u2019t been able to shake, but she wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit she\u2019d needed therapy to deal with what she went through.<br/>As though fate hadn\u2019t claimed enough, the death of her father crumbled the Earth beneath her. While practically dismissive in her life and non-existent, Charlotte had never lost a family member, and the inability to process left her reeling.

A mother with secrets withheld, an absent father who didn\u2019t pay them much mind and left them to fend for themselves. Blood is thicker than water. A saying the Almeida family held strongly to, taught their descendants during incubation in their mother\u2019s womb. Perfect, eerily so, an adjective to describe them from an outsider\u2019s perspective. Two daughters, both beautiful in their individual ways, mirror opposites of their parents. Manners well-taught and respected, brilliance beyond compare, a healthy competition that only caused a ridge between siblings. Sisters who shared everything but kinship and mutual understanding. Yin and yang, two sides of a coin. Preference and favoritism evident with each parent and one of the children. A shadow Charlotte intentionally refused to allow herself to be eclipsed by, her sister everything she wanted to be\u2013a raven-haired beauty with doe-eyes and charm that drew everyone in. A ray of light that walked among the darkness. A happy, perfect little family with Charlotte their little black sheep.</small></p><p><small>Unbeknownst to her, modest, humble, people too flocked to her for friendship, advice, a warmth about her that radiated inviting. Smile that lit up her face, crinkling eyes and contagious. A natural athlete that participated in sports, surprising that her parents agreed, the commitment to being her best self mentally and physically. Even more compelling to others that she preferred books and stories to the desire of putting herself out there 100%, preferred writing and going into the very depths of her imagination on paper. A talent hidden from her family\u2013stories were meant for children, even if the family had quite a story of their own.</small></p><p><small>\u2018Love\u2019 wasn\u2019t in the dictionary when it came to a drug cartel family. As the years went by she molded herself into her own individual, accepted her fate as the girl with a dark past. A self-awareness she developed as she grew, as she realized the life that waited for her wasn\u2019t deemed normal to the peers that surrounded her. Family dinners that were brief and discussed the simple things like school and work, not about transactions and deals. Discussions and problems that were artificial that could be solved with money. Charlotte fit the girl-next-door stereotype to a T. A role she soon grew into, kind hearted, sincere, and with a wisdom beyond her years. She could read people and their energies even when she was an infant, and didn\u2019t hesitate to call them out. Growing up in Lakewood, Texas, a small town where everyone knew everyone and their families before them. Familial history, the cream of the crop of the elite, stories she ate up every day of her life and wrote her own renditions of. Growing up, Charlotte\u2019s life was influenced by her family\u2013her sharp-mind and attitude, not at all the Southern Bell a Texan gal could become.</small></p><p><small>A familial bloodline tainted by their ancestors, lives led by crime\u2013mobsters and drug dealers. History wasn\u2019t something Charlotte wanted to be doomed to repeat. The crime life never appealed to her, never seemed a plausible solution to fill any void she felt in her otherwise perfect life, despite her father\u2019s attempted persuasion which she found half-heartedly repeated even at a young age. Almost as a second thought, given that her brother felt the same way she did and he was getting nowhere with his firstborn. But as time went on, Charlotte\u2019s curiosity grew, the incessant itch at the back of her mind and nimble fingers to find out more and write about the story of the past. It seemed thrilling, the way her father gave her the tidbits and scoops. Like a secret she\u2019d eventually be let in on when she got older.</small></p><p><small>She found people in Lakewood to teach her how to shoot, preferred the rifle over a handgun, and learned how to lie and bend the truth from careful observation of her own parents. Family history shaped Charlotte to crave more information, adventure, and journalism was something she found herself pursuing. Somehow, someway, her independent attitude caught the eye of the boy next door. A fairy-tale, romcom sort of name that went with his brilliant smile that crinkled bright blues\u2013Logan Legend. \u00a0A friendship that had grown out of habit and repetition, her ability to keep up with him something impressionable for children their age. Overtime, Charlotte grew dependent on her friendship, and as years passed, passion gave way to love. He was her influence, her strongest support system, even if he would rip her heart out and stomp on it by leaving to pursue a life of his own.</small></p><p><small>And when he left to enlist for the Army, the first 24 hours of recovery were crucial\u2013the frantic calls, the voicemails that convey anger, confusion, betrayal, depression, eagerness to please, and bargaining. Anything to convince Logan to return, anything to beg him to come and help her collect the pieces of herself that had been shattered. That first day turned into two and weeks turned into months. As the years rolled by Charlotte finally made a decision for herself\u2013to move on and not look back. Charlotte was stuck at a crossroads then, of age to learn everything she\u2019d craved but simultaneously rooted to the potential she held to forge her own path. A decision she made ultimately based on loyalty and the desire to prove her worth, the very thing her family didn\u2019t want for her. It was how they\u2019d been molded and raised, she didn\u2019t know any better. And with that Charlotte used the hole in her heart to push herself to move on too and forge her path.</small></p><p><small>Following Logan\u2019s example, Charlotte left Lakewood to discover the possibilities that lay over the ocean\u2013the world that existed just beyond, their stories left untold. A life Charlotte was envious for, her escape was the world outside her home, a world where she could pretend she wasn\u2019t associated with the life of deceit and chaos. It was then that Charlotte decided to try to learn how live on her own. Without her family to fend and look after her, the time for tears faded into nonexistence. No one was there to wipe them from plump cheeks, no one was there to tell her it was going to be alright. At least, Logan wasn\u2019t able to. A life Charlotte was envious for, her escape was the world outside her home, a world where she could pretend she wasn\u2019t associated with the life of deceit and chaos. A civilian journalist, Charlotte was sent overseas to cover the stories of a unit she\u2019d never met.</small></p><p><small>There she met Piper Sinclair, a woman who she immediately admired, whose strength exuded out like a breath of fresh air. A role model Charlotte hadn\u2019t realized she was missing. Tragedy then would bring the two together during the short time Charlotte was there. Night fell, and Charlotte awoke to chaos and the smell of gunpowder. Among the debris she found Piper, and the two soon realized they were the only survivors. The minute they were able to Charlotte convinced Piper to come to Lakewood with her, a desire to leave the tragedy behind, to run away again but this time back home. It was that moment that Charlotte knew she needed to learn how to protect herself, to fight back, and she joined the Almeida family business, finally, along with Piper. Piper who taught her everything she needed to know in order to keep up with the cartel business, including opening their own shooting range.</small></p><p><small>Loss, tragedy, it\u2019s something Charlotte hadn\u2019t been able to shake, but she wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit she\u2019d needed therapy to deal with what she went through.<br>As though fate hadn\u2019t claimed enough, the death of her father crumbled the Earth beneath her.

Perfect, eerily so, an adjective to describe them from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective. Two daughters, both beautiful in their individual ways, mirror opposites of their parents. Manners well-taught and respected, brilliance beyond compare, a healthy competition that only caused a ridge between siblings. Sisters who shared everything but kinship and mutual understanding. Yin and yang, two sides of a coin. Preference and favoritism evident with each parent and one of the children. A shadow Charlotte intentionally refused to allow herself to be eclipsed by, her sister everything she wanted to be&ndash;a raven-haired beauty with doe-eyes and charm that drew everyone in. A ray of light that walked among the darkness. A happy, perfect little family with Charlotte their little black sheep.</small></p><p><small>Unbeknownst to her, modest, humble, people too flocked to her for friendship, advice, a warmth about her that radiated inviting. Smile that lit up her face, crinkling eyes and contagious. A natural athlete that participated in sports, surprising that her parents agreed, the commitment to being her best self mentally and physically. Even more compelling to others that she preferred books and stories to the desire of putting herself out there 100%, preferred writing and going into the very depths of her imagination on paper. A talent hidden from her family&ndash;stories were meant for children, even if the family had quite a story of their own.</small></p><p><small>&lsquo;Love&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t in the dictionary when it came to a drug cartel family. As the years went by she molded herself into her own individual, accepted her fate as the girl with a dark past. A self-awareness she developed as she grew, as she realized the life that waited for her wasn&rsquo;t deemed normal to the peers that surrounded her. Family dinners that were brief and discussed the simple things like school and work, not about transactions and deals. Discussions and problems that were artificial that could be solved with money. Charlotte fit the girl-next-door stereotype to a T. A role she soon grew into, kind hearted, sincere, and with a wisdom beyond her years. She could read people and their energies even when she was an infant, and didn&rsquo;t hesitate to call them out. Growing up in Lakewood, Texas, a small town where everyone knew everyone and their families before them. Familial history, the cream of the crop of the elite, stories she ate up every day of her life and wrote her own renditions of. Growing up, Charlotte&rsquo;s life was influenced by her family&ndash;her sharp-mind and attitude, not at all the Southern Bell a Texan gal could become.</small></p><p><small>A familial bloodline tainted by their ancestors, lives led by crime&ndash;mobsters and drug dealers. History wasn&rsquo;t something Charlotte wanted to be doomed to repeat. The crime life never appealed to her, never seemed a plausible solution to fill any void she felt in her otherwise perfect life, despite her father&rsquo;s attempted persuasion which she found half-heartedly repeated even at a young age. Almost as a second thought, given that her brother felt the same way she did and he was getting nowhere with his firstborn. But as time went on, Charlotte&rsquo;s curiosity grew, the incessant itch at the back of her mind and nimble fingers to find out more and write about the story of the past. It seemed thrilling, the way her father gave her the tidbits and scoops. Like a secret she&rsquo;d eventually be let in on when she got older.</small></p><p><small>She found people in Lakewood to teach her how to shoot, preferred the rifle over a handgun, and learned how to lie and bend the truth from careful observation of her own parents. Family history shaped Charlotte to crave more information, adventure, and journalism was something she found herself pursuing. Somehow, someway, her independent attitude caught the eye of the boy next door. A fairy-tale, romcom sort of name that went with his brilliant smile that crinkled bright blues&ndash;Logan Legend. &nbsp;A friendship that had grown out of habit and repetition, her ability to keep up with him something impressionable for children their age. Overtime, Charlotte grew dependent on her friendship, and as years passed, passion gave way to love. He was her influence, her strongest support system, even if he would rip her heart out and stomp on it by leaving to pursue a life of his own.</small></p><p><small>And when he left to enlist for the Army, the first 24 hours of recovery were crucial&ndash;the frantic calls, the voicemails that convey anger, confusion, betrayal, depression, eagerness to please, and bargaining. Anything to convince Logan to return, anything to beg him to come and help her collect the pieces of herself that had been shattered. That first day turned into two and weeks turned into months. As the years rolled by Charlotte finally made a decision for herself&ndash;to move on and not look back. Charlotte was stuck at a crossroads then, of age to learn everything she&rsquo;d craved but simultaneously rooted to the potential she held to forge her own path. A decision she made ultimately based on loyalty and the desire to prove her worth, the very thing her family didn&rsquo;t want for her. It was how they&rsquo;d been molded and raised, she didn&rsquo;t know any better. And with that Charlotte used the hole in her heart to push herself to move on too and forge her path.</small></p><p><small>Following Logan&rsquo;s example, Charlotte left Lakewood to discover the possibilities that lay over the ocean&ndash;the world that existed just beyond, their stories left untold. A life Charlotte was envious for, her escape was the world outside her home, a world where she could pretend she wasn&rsquo;t associated with the life of deceit and chaos. It was then that Charlotte decided to try to learn how live on her own. Without her family to fend and look after her, the time for tears faded into nonexistence. No one was there to wipe them from plump cheeks, no one was there to tell her it was going to be alright. At least, Logan wasn&rsquo;t able to. A life Charlotte was envious for, her escape was the world outside her home, a world where she could pretend she wasn&rsquo;t associated with the life of deceit and chaos. A civilian journalist, Charlotte was sent overseas to cover the stories of a unit she&rsquo;d never met.</small></p><p><small>There she met Piper Sinclair, a woman who she immediately admired, whose strength exuded out like a breath of fresh air. A role model Charlotte hadn&rsquo;t realized she was missing. Tragedy then would bring the two together during the short time Charlotte was there. Night fell, and Charlotte awoke to chaos and the smell of gunpowder. Among the debris she found Piper, and the two soon realized they were the only survivors. The minute they were able to Charlotte convinced Piper to come to Lakewood with her, a desire to leave the tragedy behind, to run away again but this time back home. It was that moment that Charlotte knew she needed to learn how to protect herself, to fight back, and she joined the Almeida family business, finally, along with Piper. Piper who taught her everything she needed to know in order to keep up with the cartel business, including opening their own shooting range.</small></p><p><small>Loss, tragedy, it&rsquo;s something Charlotte hadn&rsquo;t been able to shake, but she wasn&rsquo;t ashamed to admit she&rsquo;d needed therapy to deal with what she went through.<br />As though fate hadn&rsquo;t claimed enough, the death of her father crumbled the Earth beneath her. While practically dismissive in her life and non-existent, Charlotte had never lost a family member, and the inability to process left her reeling. Stories didn&rsquo;t quite accurately describe death and grief&ndash;how it left you feeling like it lingered, cold arms wrapped around you tightly to it&rsquo;s breast, like a breath caught in your throat you couldn&rsquo;t catch. Wrecked, her sister was, and as the thought passed that perhaps this was the catalyst to bring them together, news followed, whispers, pointed fingers. A child born out of wedlock, an affair to remember. An unfaithful woman who called herself &lsquo;mother&rsquo;&ndash;Charlotte learned that her uncle was in fact her own father. Identity crisis emotionally overloaded from the grief and confusion of who she was. Charlotte bolted, attempted to flee town, drowning her sorrows in alcohol and cigarettes, anything to make her realize this was just a dream. A drunken call that went to a memorized number, voicemail, sobs incoherent and a solitary clear sentence expressing feelings withheld.</small></p><p><small>The sun had always shone a little brighter with the Logan&rsquo;s. Often the fantasy of the broken shell of a man she had once known now returned,&ndash;and Charlotte knew where to guide him. Using her name, Logan would be welcomed into the Almeida family. Celebration, reunion, but still questions of the unknown, that unquenchable journalist curiosity&ndash;Charlotte was afraid to find out everything that had happened while they&rsquo;d been apart. In a way, she felt as though his physical self had returned, but emotionally and mentally had not. While she wished and longed that he would, it would be during that time that Charlie would admit that she&rsquo;d realized she had always been in love with Logan, and came to accept the fact that because she hadn&rsquo;t been true to herself, perhaps that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;d imploded. That perhaps they were two who could maybe never be a whole. Two puzzle pieces that didn&rsquo;t quite fit together. The kite and the line. Her with her head in the clouds and endless curiosity to find more stories, and him grounded and planted to the very reality they existed in. Perhaps then, they could make it work. Instead, the dial tone after admittance that she missed him.</small></p><p><small>For 6 months Charlotte attempted to try to make it out in California, applied for a job with a local newspaper, sat at a desk and tried to drown herself in paperwork. Unfulfilling, mindless, and thoughts that drifted back to family and one face in particular. An actual call from her own mother begging forgiveness and for her to come back and start over. Obedient, Charlotte was, as she retreated back to the place she belonged, like a sheep back to the flock she could never truly stray from.</small></p><p>&rarr; PERSONALITY SUMMARY</p><p><small>\n\n+ : Compassionate, intelligent, plucky.<br />- : Argumentative, insecure, moody\n\n</small><br /></p>",
