We\u2019re human, we all need to give love, as much as we need to receive it. Even Tywin Lannister. He\u2019s deemed it safe to be kind to his little cupbearer whose sharpness interests him, and whose fierceness reminds him of his daughter. Only when no one\u2019s looking of course. Can\u2019t have it be said that Lord Tywin talks to help. I always longed for a scene where Tywin finds out Arya was right under his nose and he let her go, I think it would be a great moment of Tywin kicking himself and just thinking \u201cLove weakens you, love weakens you and I must never let my guard down\u201d. </p><p>As I said yeah, the circumstances leading up to Arya being Tywin\u2019s cupbearer are not believable, but Tywin showing kindness isn\u2019t ooc, it just adds a layer of complexity onto his character which I for one love</p>",
                "content": "<p>Listening to a podcast of book readers that are saying it&rsquo;s OOC for Tywin to talk to his cupbearer, but idk, I feel like that&rsquo;s sort of the point. During his scenes with her I get the sense that Tywin himself doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing. Being kind has always been akin to showing weakness in Lord Tywin&rsquo;s mind yet he&rsquo;s kind to Arya. Rather than this seeming like bad writing, to me, I find it fascinating.
