From the corner of your eye, you spotted your parents at the head table. Thankfully, they were having too much of a good time to pay you any mind. Much to your relief, your four elder brothers were also too preoccupied to take notice of you.</p><p>As the only girl in the family, you were constantly being watched. If not by family members, then it was by the myriad of servants who felt it their duty to protect you at all costs.\u00a0</p><p>At one time, your people were considered a lesser House. Pledging fealty to the more illustrious and wealthier families in Westeros. Nevertheless, with sheer determination and wisdom, your ancestors were able to scale the political ladder and secure a legacy. </p><p>House Forester was now a Great House and equal to that of the Starks, Umbers and the like. Not only that, but your grandfather was on the small council as Master of Coin and your father was Master of Transports. Indeed, your life was quite an enviable one.</p><p>Still, there were limitations to your happiness.\u00a0</p><p>You were betrothed to Lord Myles Arryn. The eldest nephew of Eddard and Catelyn Stark and heir to The Vale. But despite him proving to be kindhearted and unexpectedly handsome, your heart belonged to another. </p><p>Jon Snow.\u00a0</p><p>Ever since the day you made acquaintance with Eddard Stark&rsquo;s bastard, you couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone else. Because of those feelings, you now found yourself searching for him instead of enjoying the festivities. </p><p>When you finally made your way to the massive doors, you stepped into the passageway and looked around. There were pockets of people standing about making merriment and having their fill of the fine wines and ales your father had imported. After some time, you finally saw two familiar faces.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</b> You exclaimed after spotting him walking beside Theon Greyjoy. </p><p>For whatever reason his expression hardly changed but Theon gave you a silly grin.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Lady Y/N, shall I escort you back inside?&rdquo; </b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Thank you. But I actually wanted a word with Jon.&rdquo; </b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"428\" data-orig-height=\"221\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/862c11921dceebe76b23ac43a22af195/tumblr_inline_ps8dglN6op1rbidwg_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"428\" data-orig-height=\"221\"/></figure><p>Glancing between you both a moment, Theon smirked before walking away. To your annoyance, Jon also tried to leave, forcing you to grab hold of his leather vesting. </p><p><b>&ldquo;I said I wanted to talk to you.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;What for, my Lady?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;You have intentionally been avoiding me ever since your family arrived yesterday. Why is that?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;There is no reason. Please, just get back to the feast and enjoy your night.&rdquo;</b></p><p>You were angered by his indifference but still followed, determined to be heard. It was strange. Jon had always been the brooding type but this time around, it felt different. He was behaving as if he didn&rsquo;t even know who you were. </p><p>When the two of you arrived in the courtyard, the music and boisterous voices from the Great Hall filled the night.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Jon, please look at me. I have missed you so much.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Lady Y/N, I beg of you, please go indoors. Nothing good can come from you being here with me.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</b> You exclaimed. Refusing to leave him be, you affectionately took hold of his hand. It wasn&rsquo;t the wisest thing to do should anyone see the gesture. However, in that moment, you did not care. <b>&ldquo;Do you know how worried I have been? You never responded to the last letter I sent through my manservant. Why?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not make things harder than they have to be.&rdquo;</b> Jon said as he looked away.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cYou are speaking in riddles. I\u2019m&mdash;&ndash;\u201d</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I overheard Myles and Robb say that their vows are to take place in the springtime. That means in a few months&rsquo; time, you will be a married woman. We must face the truth. Though we thought we had time to figure things out, the Gods have deemed otherwise.&rdquo; </b></p><p>You heaved a sigh but remained resolute. Jon was the man you wanted and giving up wasn&rsquo;t something you were willing to do.</p><p><b>&ldquo;We still have to try. My father can speak to yours about making you legitimate. After all, they are close friends.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Even if he wanted to do such a thing, my father could never make me a Stark. Catelyn will never allow it.

From the corner of your eye, you spotted your parents at the head table. Thankfully, they were having too much of a good time to pay you any mind. Much to your relief, your four elder brothers were also too preoccupied to take notice of you.</p><p>As the only girl in the family, you were constantly being watched. If not by family members, then it was by the myriad of servants who felt it their duty to protect you at all costs.\u00a0</p><p>At one time, your people were considered a lesser House. Pledging fealty to the more illustrious and wealthier families in Westeros. Nevertheless, with sheer determination and wisdom, your ancestors were able to scale the political ladder and secure a legacy. </p><p>House Forester was now a Great House and equal to that of the Starks, Umbers and the like. Not only that, but your grandfather was on the small council as Master of Coin and your father was Master of Transports. Indeed, your life was quite an enviable one.</p><p>Still, there were limitations to your happiness.\u00a0</p><p>You were betrothed to Lord Myles Arryn. The eldest nephew of Eddard and Catelyn Stark and heir to The Vale. But despite him proving to be kindhearted and unexpectedly handsome, your heart belonged to another. </p><p>Jon Snow.\u00a0</p><p>Ever since the day you made acquaintance with Eddard Stark\u2019s bastard, you couldn\u2019t think of anyone else. Because of those feelings, you now found yourself searching for him instead of enjoying the festivities. </p><p>When you finally made your way to the massive doors, you stepped into the passageway and looked around. There were pockets of people standing about making merriment and having their fill of the fine wines and ales your father had imported. After some time, you finally saw two familiar faces.</p><p><b>\u201cJon.\u201d</b> You exclaimed after spotting him walking beside Theon Greyjoy. </p><p>For whatever reason his expression hardly changed but Theon gave you a silly grin.</p><p><b>\u201cLady Y/N, shall I escort you back inside?\u201d </b></p><p><b>\u201cThank you.

If not by family members, then it was by the myriad of servants who felt it their duty to protect you at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p>At one time, your people were considered a lesser House. Pledging fealty to the more illustrious and wealthier families in Westeros. Nevertheless, with sheer determination and wisdom, your ancestors were able to scale the political ladder and secure a legacy. </p><p>House Forester was now a Great House and equal to that of the Starks, Umbers and the like. Not only that, but your grandfather was on the small council as Master of Coin and your father was Master of Transports. Indeed, your life was quite an enviable one.</p><p>Still, there were limitations to your happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>You were betrothed to Lord Myles Arryn. The eldest nephew of Eddard and Catelyn Stark and heir to The Vale. But despite him proving to be kindhearted and unexpectedly handsome, your heart belonged to another. </p><p>Jon Snow.&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since the day you made acquaintance with Eddard Stark&rsquo;s bastard, you couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone else. Because of those feelings, you now found yourself searching for him instead of enjoying the festivities. </p><p>When you finally made your way to the massive doors, you stepped into the passageway and looked around. There were pockets of people standing about making merriment and having their fill of the fine wines and ales your father had imported. After some time, you finally saw two familiar faces.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</b> You exclaimed after spotting him walking beside Theon Greyjoy. </p><p>For whatever reason his expression hardly changed but Theon gave you a silly grin.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Lady Y/N, shall I escort you back inside?&rdquo; </b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Thank you. But I actually wanted a word with Jon.&rdquo; </b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/862c11921dceebe76b23ac43a22af195/tumblr_inline_ps8dglN6op1rbidwg_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Glancing between you both a moment, Theon smirked before walking away. To your annoyance, Jon also tried to leave, forcing you to grab hold of his leather vesting. </p><p><b>&ldquo;I said I wanted to talk to you.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;What for, my Lady?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;You have intentionally been avoiding me ever since your family arrived yesterday. Why is that?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;There is no reason. Please, just get back to the feast and enjoy your night.&rdquo;</b></p><p>You were angered by his indifference but still followed, determined to be heard. It was strange. Jon had always been the brooding type but this time around, it felt different. He was behaving as if he didn&rsquo;t even know who you were. </p><p>When the two of you arrived in the courtyard, the music and boisterous voices from the Great Hall filled the night.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Jon, please look at me. I have missed you so much.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Lady Y/N, I beg of you, please go indoors. Nothing good can come from you being here with me.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</b> You exclaimed. Refusing to leave him be, you affectionately took hold of his hand. It wasn&rsquo;t the wisest thing to do should anyone see the gesture. However, in that moment, you did not care. <b>&ldquo;Do you know how worried I have been? You never responded to the last letter I sent through my manservant. Why?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not make things harder than they have to be.&rdquo;</b> Jon said as he looked away.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&ldquo;You are speaking in riddles. I&rsquo;m&mdash;&ndash;&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I overheard Myles and Robb say that their vows are to take place in the springtime. That means in a few months&rsquo; time, you will be a married woman. We must face the truth. Though we thought we had time to figure things out, the Gods have deemed otherwise.&rdquo; </b></p><p>You heaved a sigh but remained resolute. Jon was the man you wanted and giving up wasn&rsquo;t something you were willing to do.</p><p><b>&ldquo;We still have to try. My father can speak to yours about making you legitimate. After all, they are close friends.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Even if he wanted to do such a thing, my father could never make me a Stark. Catelyn will never allow it. Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve come to realize how much that woman hates me.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the Wall.&rdquo; </b>He confessed as his eyes met finally met yours.<b> &ldquo;Taking the Black.&rdquo;</b></p><p>You nearly collapsed. Why would his father agree to send Jon to the Night&rsquo;s Watch? It was such a hazardous occupation and their oath forbid any semblance of a normal life.</p><p><b>&ldquo;I&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..I&rsquo;ll use my sway with Prince Joffrey. He can present the issue before his father.&rdquo; </b>You suggested.<b> &ldquo;Your stepmother&rsquo;s council cannot hold a candle to the King&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m a man of my word. I have already accepted my father&rsquo;s command and I must follow through.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Why are you speaking this way?&rdquo; </b>You asked with an aching heart.<b> &ldquo;What about all the things you said about us? Are those not vows as well?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;You speak the truth. But those were the words of a man overtaken by desire instead of reason.&rdquo;</b></p><p>You let go of his hand, too wounded to stand there any longer. He really meant to leave you without putting up much of a fight. As you tried to rush away so he wouldn&rsquo;t see you cry, Jon grabbed hold of your arm.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Y/N, I do love you. You&rsquo;re the first thing I think about when I wake and the last thing I think about before I close my eyes. Nothing will ever change that.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Liar! If that were so, you wouldn&rsquo;t give up so quickly.&rdquo; </b>You seethed as you tried to wriggle out of his grasp. <b>&ldquo;If that is how you want it, I will learn to love Lord Myles.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I know you still love me.&rdquo;</b> Jon said as he embraced you. <b>&ldquo;But I cannot destroy your life. You don&rsquo;t need to be dragged through the mud because of a bastard such as myself. You deserve more.&rdquo;</b></p><p>You shed tears at the prospect of living life without ever seeing him again. For a bastard, he had always been noble. Never doing more than holding your hand or teaching you all manner of things such as archery. </p><p>Even when you managed to find yourselves alone, he never took advantage of your feelings. In fact, Jon preferred to sit silently beside you, content at just being in your company. </p><p><b>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run off to the Summer Isles or Dorne.&rdquo;</b> You suggested with your face buried in his chest. <b>&ldquo;I have loads of jewelry we can sell.&rdquo;</b></p><p>Jon smiled to himself aware that you were merely venting and not in your right mind.&nbsp;</p><p>What you didn&rsquo;t know was that he had plans he could not divulge. Despite resigning himself to taking the Black, he had no intentions of giving you up. Somehow, someway, Jon would return and take you as his own. And the Gods help anyone who would dare try to stop him when that day arrived.</p></p>",
