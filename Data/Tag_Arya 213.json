        "body": "<p>After reading Fire and Blood (I have completed my first reading), I am now increasingly inclined to believe that a Faceless Men hit will be taken out on Dany in the last season. Here is why:</p><p>1) We learn that the Faceless Men, as well as the Iron Bank are not completely aloof institutions that have nothing to do with Braavosi state policy, but are actually very closely connected to the Braavosi state and can be seen as acting as instruments of the state (it makes sense though, I mean why else would Braavos allow two such powerful and dangerous institutions to exist on their soil?). When Septon Barth (on behalf of Jaehaerys) makes the threat of a dragon attack on Braavos, the Sealord\u2019s response is to push him to a stalemate by reminding him that Braavos has the Faceless Men (and insinuating that he will have them kill off the Targaryen family). Dragons vs. Faceless Men is basically a seen to be a mutually assured destruction situation. Also the Sealord is able to get the Iron Bank to forgive a substantial amount of Westerosi debt.</p><p>2) We learn once more that the suspected Dornish message that forced Aegon the Conqueror to stop his attack on Dorne (despite the fact that Dorne no longer had the strength to fight the Targaryens) was a threat that the Dornish will engage the Faceless Men of Braavos to kill Aegon\u2019s heirs. So <i><b>twice we have seen that the Faceless Men can be used as a threat to balance the otherwise impossible to beat power of dragons</b></i>. Also, they may be responsible for destroying Valyria in the first place.</p><p>3) We learn again and again of the Braavosi aversion to dragons.</p><p>4) The show is showing us that the Iron Bank is on Cersei\u2019s side. On the face of it this seems like a bizarre choice for the Bank to make. Dany may have disturbed the profits they made from the slave trade in Essos, but that is in the past. She is in Westeros now. She has an enormous military advantage. Why is the Bank, which is a financial superpower, and not known for making bad bets, financing her (i.e. Cersei)? The wiser course for the bank seems to be to either support Dany, or to sit this out and see who emerges victorious. Cersei does not have a strong hand vs. dragons. Why are they helping her hire the Golden Company etc.? It makes little sense&hellip; Unless they plan to neutralize Dany too. But how else are they to do that except by using the Faceless Men (in the books it also seems like a Faceless man is at the Citadel taking a book that may help him kill dragons)?</p><p>5) The biggest weakness in Dany\u2019s entire organizational structure, the one that Tyrion has pointed out, the one that Jaime tried to take advantage of in 7x04 when he tried to kill her, is that the whole thing revolves around her person. Take Dany out of the game and everything collapses completely. The whole threat just vanishes. Makes sense for the Bank to realize this too.</p><p>6) I feel that Arya\u2019s whole Faceless men arc will have some deeper endgame consequences too. So far all it\u2019s done (other than the Frey revenge) is just turn her into a great fighter. This is something that she could have become even by hanging out with the Hound or Brienne. The whole thing with the Faceless Men seems to be something that will have deeper consequences than just making Arya into a warrior. She could have become a warrior in a more conventional way. All the weird magical training seems superfluous.</p><p>The above reasons make me think that Cersei (with the help of the Bank) will send Faceless Men after Dany. Braavos may lowkey support this. If so, Arya is the only person who has the knowledge and training to be able to thwart such a scheme. This may be a significant subplot next season. What do you think?</p>",

Here is why:</p><p>1) We learn that the Faceless Men, as well as the Iron Bank are not completely aloof institutions that have nothing to do with Braavosi state policy, but are actually very closely connected to the Braavosi state and can be seen as acting as instruments of the state (it makes sense though, I mean why else would Braavos allow two such powerful and dangerous institutions to exist on their soil?). When Septon Barth (on behalf of Jaehaerys) makes the threat of a dragon attack on Braavos, the Sealord\u2019s response is to push him to a stalemate by reminding him that Braavos has the Faceless Men (and insinuating that he will have them kill off the Targaryen family). Dragons vs. Faceless Men is basically a seen to be a mutually assured destruction situation. Also the Sealord is able to get the Iron Bank to forgive a substantial amount of Westerosi debt.</p><p>2) We learn once more that the suspected Dornish message that forced Aegon the Conqueror to stop his attack on Dorne (despite the fact that Dorne no longer had the strength to fight the Targaryens) was a threat that the Dornish will engage the Faceless Men of Braavos to kill Aegon\u2019s heirs. So <i><b>twice we have seen that the Faceless Men can be used as a threat to balance the otherwise impossible to beat power of dragons</b></i>. Also, they may be responsible for destroying Valyria in the first place.</p><p>3) We learn again and again of the Braavosi aversion to dragons.</p><p>4) The show is showing us that the Iron Bank is on Cersei\u2019s side. On the face of it this seems like a bizarre choice for the Bank to make. Dany may have disturbed the profits they made from the slave trade in Essos, but that is in the past. She is in Westeros now. She has an enormous military advantage. Why is the Bank, which is a financial superpower, and not known for making bad bets, financing her (i.e. Cersei)? The wiser course for the bank seems to be to either support Dany, or to sit this out and see who emerges victorious. Cersei does not have a strong hand vs. dragons. Why are they helping her hire the Golden Company etc.? It makes little sense\u2026 Unless they plan to neutralize Dany too. But how else are they to do that except by using the Faceless Men (in the books it also seems like a Faceless man is at the Citadel taking a book that may help him kill dragons)?</p><p>5) The biggest weakness in Dany\u2019s entire organizational structure, the one that Tyrion has pointed out, the one that Jaime tried to take advantage of in 7x04 when he tried to kill her, is that the whole thing revolves around her person. Take Dany out of the game and everything collapses completely. The whole threat just vanishes. Makes sense for the Bank to realize this too.</p><p>6) I feel that Arya\u2019s whole Faceless men arc will have some deeper endgame consequences too.
