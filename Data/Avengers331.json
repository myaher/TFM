Hurt was written across his face as his heart dropped into his stomach.</p><p><i>\u201cDon&rsquo;t ever say sorry for doing that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bliss. That was the feeling that filled him to the brim, pure and utter bliss. It flowed through him like a river, replacing his blood with the beauty of your smile. It was his lifeline now, the only thing he&rsquo;d ever need. It pulled him to lean in again, crashing his lips back into yours with fever, pouring more emotions into it, putting his soul into it like he never had before. His hands gripped your waist tightly, and it was almost as if you could feel his desperation through his fingertips. Fireworks were popping in your brain. You&rsquo;re flying. You&rsquo;re on top of the world. You&rsquo;re complete. You&rsquo;re in <b>love.</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI can&rsquo;t do this.\u201d</i></p><p>Realization, panic, fear. You&rsquo;re in love. Your heart stopped beating in your chest and you pushed away frantically, breaking the kiss, that beautiful, wonderful kiss. You might have just made the worst decision of your life. You fell in love, with Bucky <i>Fucking</i> Barnes.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I just&hellip;I can&rsquo;t do this. We can&rsquo;t do this.\u201d You stuttered on the words, breath picking up rapidly.</p><p>You could almost hear his heart shatter, the look on his face created an aching in your chest and for the first time since Manarola, yours shattered too. Even after watching this man be beaten and broken and torn apart and utterly destroyed, you&rsquo;d never seen a pain as deep seeded and decimating as the kind that shadowed his face in that very moment. His bright, blue eyes seemed to darken as a pit opened in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean you can&rsquo;t do this?\u201d God his voice felt like someone was cutting the strings of your heart one by one, the tremor and crack and absolute brokenness of the sound filling your veins with a blackness you knew you would never be able to wash away again. \u201cYou kissed me back. You felt it too. I-I know you felt it too.\u201d</p><p>Bucky could feel the sting behind his eyes as his mouth went dry and he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. He couldn&rsquo;t fucking<i> breathe. </i>His world was cracked right down the middle and it continued to splinter as you stared, unmoving, in front of him. You must have felt it too, he was desperate to hear you admit it. He was desperate to not be the only one. He loved you, and he needed you to love him back. So much so, that the urge forced words from his mouth that burned when they left his lips, ached when they hit the air because they didn\u2019t want to enter a world where you wouldn\u2019t except them.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Time stopped, everything stopped, and in that moment, it was just you and him, the only people in the world. He loved you, and no matter how much you wanted and tried to say it back, the words wouldn\u2019t leave you. A sickeningly dense silence filled the room.</p><p>\u201cB-Bucky I&hellip;I-I\u2026\u201d you stuttered, tripping on words as your mind raced. You watched with pain as his eyes began to brim with tears and he took a distressed step forward.</p><p>You were both interrupted by the door opening and Steve Rogers slipped into the room, stopping short as he saw the interaction before him. In a ditch attempt to escape the situation, you flashed him a pleading look and the moment his eyes locked on the tear-stained cheeks of his best friend, he snapped into action. Long strides carried him to Bucky, hands gripping his shoulders as he forced him back.</p><p>Gesturing out with his head, he rushed, \u201cGo to my room, it\u2019s next door, F.R.I.D.A.Y. will let you in. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes were locked on you, red and puffy, and they gave him the expression of a kicked puppy. A whispered shaky apology escaped your lips as you began to rush from the room, stumbling on your own feet.</p><p>\u201cI said I love you. I love you.\u201d he was calling out to you as you fled, choking back sobs as he began to shout, \u201cI love you goddammit, say something! Say something!&hellip;P-Please..\u201d</p><p>His yells succeeded in cracking the walls you held up so hopelessly, and once the door to Rogers\u2019s room shut behind you, tears poured down your cheeks as you backed into the wall, sliding down into a heap on the floor and burying your face in your hands.</p><p>~~</p><p>After you had left the room, Bucky slowly started shutting down, forcing his emotions back into his mind, and going completely soundless. Steve had tried to get an explanation out of him, anything to understand what he walked in on, but he quickly discovered he was wasting his time. The man was silent, vacant eyes staring at the wall in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou should go take a shower, clear your head. I&rsquo;ll go talk to her, work out what we&rsquo;re going to do,\u201d Steve was pulling clothes out of drawers and placing them on the bed, pushing Bucky out of his chair gently and towards the bathroom.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t put up much of a protest, grumbling quietly as he shuffled to the bathroom and slammed the door behind him. Steve let out a sigh, gazing at the closed room for a few seconds before he reluctantly headed for his room to speak with you.</p><p>You had picked yourself up from the floor weakly, aggressively rubbing away the tears with a sniffle. Taking the first look around the Captain\u2019s room, you studied it, gathering a brief understanding of the man behind the shield. It was odd, someone who evidently didn&rsquo;t trust you, allowing you in such a private place without hesitation. It was obviously in the interest of his friend, but something in the way he looked at you felt oddly&hellip;comforting, like this invitation to his room was a way of sheltering <i>you</i> and not just the exposed heart of Bucky. It was much more personalized than the soldier\u2019s, pictures littered the walls and the colors were a bit less muted. The style was practical, yet characterized in its own unique way. You walked slowly away from the door, fingers gently grazing the top of his dresser, eyes scanning the photos there. The hitch in your breath when you inhaled forced you to stop, bowing your head as you took calming breaths through your nose. You stood that way for a moment, before rubbing away the remaining tears and making your way to the window. The city was lit up in the darkness of the night, windows illuminated in perfect rows down the length of the many skyscrapers looming on the horizon. The thick glass of the panels blocked out any sounds from the streets, headlights passed by silently, and occasionally the pattern of the lights on the buildings would change. You watched the scene mutely, but inside, your mind was screaming.</p><p>A noise behind you whipped your attention away from the window as Steve cleared his throat behind you. You didn\u2019t hear him come in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I walked into, or what was happening, but we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Those words were never good, not in your experience, and you closed your eyes with a sigh. Alone, for the first time in a long time, you couldn&rsquo;t help but let the tears fall, but you&rsquo;d be damned if you let that wall down in front of Steve Rogers. Taking in a deep breath, you straighten your posture, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know what there is to talk about, Spangles,\u201d you shot, but your voice faltered as you added, \u201cThat was a private matter, that evidently didn&rsquo;t go very well.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face, an agitated sigh leaving his lips, \u201cI&hellip;you&rsquo;re right.\u201d</p><p>It felt like someone switched a breaker in your mind. It sizzled and popped like a TV without a signal. You must have been hearing things because there is no way in the infinite possibilities of universes that America\u2019s Golden Boy, Captain America himself, just agreed with you. Your eyebrow rose to the roof.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, you\u2019re right,\u201d he repeated, nodding his head before he pulled the seat from under the table and motioned for you to sit on the bed, \u201cSo we\u2019ll talk about something else. Cause if I\u2019m going to help you, I need to get to know you. Bucky is convinced you\u2019re not what HYDRA made you, but I need you to prove that to me.\u201d</p><p>You hardened your expression, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat. Your mind flashed back to Bucky, the broken expression that took over his features when you failed to say those three words back. Steve did not hold your trust in the slightest, but he <i>was</i> Bucky\u2019s friend, and after seeing the heartbreak in that man\u2019s eyes that <i>you</i> caused, you\u2019d do anything to fix it, even if that meant opening up to Steve Rogers.</p><p>Letting out a sigh, you slowly sat on the bed, folding your hands on your lap and looking up to meet his eyes, \u201cWhat do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cWhen you first got here, he said he owed you. What for?\u201d Steve was careful with his tone, watching your fingers twitch in your lap as he softened his expression slightly.</p><p><i>It wasn\u2019t exactly a rare occasion to share a cell with the other asset and the both of you had grown quite accustomed to sharing your space. It was a normal night by your standards and you sat on the floor, gazing blankly at the dirty concrete. A shuffle dragged your attention into your surroundings and you looked up to see Winter standing strangely in the middle of the cell, illuminated by the light beam from the barred viewport, hair even more disheveled than usual, hands out in front of him as he seemed entranced by the sight of them, flipping them over and over as his ragged breathing entered your ear. You furrowed your brows, rising slowly from the ground as you cautiously lifted your hands at the ready. He looked up, an uncharacteristic panic in his eyes as he took an aggressive step forward.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not the Winter Soldier.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The words made you freeze, mind clicking as you swallowed thickly. He repeated himself with more force, a determination filling him that you had never seen. It had been a long time since either of you had been wiped and the programming was wearing thinner and thinner. His seemed to have cracked and it spurred a ridge in your own. Everything in your mind was screaming for you to stop what you were doing, but it wasn\u2019t strong enough as you bent down, pushing a broken chunk of concrete out of the way to grab what was hidden behind it. Something was pulling at you, desperately trying to stop you from moving towards him, stop you from doing this because it was a risk you weren\u2019t sure was worth taking. For the first time, you fought against your better judgment, trading survival for sympathy as you stepped towards him. He was hesitant, but the look you gave him locked him in a trance. You reached him, wordlessly asking permission before you took his hands in yours gently, flipping the palms up before placing the object in his grasp. The metal was cold on his skin, the chain dangling between his fingers, and he looked in shock between you and his hands. You covered his hand with your own, looking him in the eye deeply as the dog tags warmed between your fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThese are yours. I found them in the archives. I&hellip;kept them. I don\u2019t know why, but I did. They belong to you though. Keep these safe. No matter what happens, no matter what they do to you, you keep these.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat&hellip;W-What are they?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey\u2019re you. These are your dog tags. Your name is Bucky. And you\u2019re not the Winter Soldier.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou had his dog tags? How? Why?\u201d There was an expression on Steve\u2019s face you couldn&rsquo;t quite place. It was mixed between sadness, confusion, and&hellip;relief? Happiness? The word to describe it escaped you, and you slid your gaze from his piercing blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI found them in the archives when I was&hellip;When I was looking for my own files, which I never found. I don&rsquo;t know why I kept them, honestly, I don&rsquo;t,\u201d you cleared your throat, desperate to keep your composure, \u201cand I don&rsquo;t know why I gave them to him. But he <i>did</i> keep them. Right where I hid them. He still has them, he had them when he was wiped before he fought you on the helicarriers. They kept a piece of him alive and he owed me for that. I&rsquo;ve already cashed my check and he paid the bill. I don&rsquo;t want anything else from him.\u201d</p><p>There was a strange feeling in your chest with those last words, as if you were trying to convince the man in front of you wholeheartedly that you didn&rsquo;t want any more from Bucky Barnes. Why you felt the need to say it was beyond you.</p><p>Steve only nodded, finally breaking the hold his gaze held over you as he looked away with a thick swallow. The gears seemed to be turning in his head, reeling up another question.</p><p>\u201cWhen I broke you out,\u201d his words were slow, the cogs in his head working double time to make the words come out right, before he backtracked in his question, \u201cyou didn&rsquo;t trust me, I know you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> trust me, but all it took was for me to say \u2018I&rsquo;m on Bucky\u2019s side\u2019 to get you to follow me. I know you&rsquo;re not stupid, I know you know, as well as I do, that I very well could have been lying to you. I could have been making things worse. Why did you give in so easily?\u201d</p><p>You were slightly taken aback by the question, pausing to blink a few times as you breathed in and out, calculating your response carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re right, Steve, I&rsquo;m not stupid,\u201d you held back your own shock at the softness of your tone, Steve had evidently noticed the change because he shifted in his chair, expression easing just the tiniest bit of tension, \u201cI can see how much you matter to Bucky and you&rsquo;ve shown me <i>many</i> times how much he matters to you. He&rsquo;s the closest thing I have to an ally right now and I need to take what I can get. I know when I&rsquo;m had, I know when I&rsquo;m screwed. If I have to swallow my pride and follow the man who had me arrested,\u201d you added with a bite of irritation, but it faded, \u201cI&rsquo;ll do it. If Bucky trust you&hellip;then I&rsquo;ll have to trust you, too.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn&rsquo;t respond. His eyes were fixed on your hands, twiddling in your lap as he pushed out a breath.</p><p>He inhaled sharply, adjusting his posture as he stood, nodding and eased, \u201cOkay. That works for me.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrow shot to the roof as you rose with him, \u201cWait, what? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d a soft smile pull at his previous hardened expression, \u201clook, I can see what Bucky sees. There\u2019s more to you than your files, I see that now. I made the wrong call with you, and now I want to make up for that.\u201d</p><p>Silence was all you gave him, eyes boring into his, searching for a hint of deceit as you fought the drop of your jaw. Even when you tried to speak, you stuttered on your words, tripping over every syllable. His hand rose to stop you, shaking his head with a gentle smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get moving. We can&rsquo;t stay here forever. I&rsquo;ll get the team to come around but until then it&rsquo;s best if you&rsquo;re not here. I&rsquo;ll get the plan finalized and we&rsquo;ll all talk about it,\u201d he watched you twitch at the words and he repeated firmly, \u201cWe&rsquo;ll <i>all</i> talk about it.\u201d</p><p>You merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d his tone changed as he started towards the door, \u201cYou should take some time, freshen up, relax. You can use my shower. I&rsquo;ll have clothes here for you when you&rsquo;re done, then we&rsquo;ll work everything out.\u201d</p><p>You opened your mouth to protest but he stopped you with a pointed look.</p><p>You heard a sigh and dropped your shoulders, waving him off as you moved towards the bathroom and relented, \u201cWhatever, Stars and Stripes.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed quietly with a smile and exited the room, leaving you alone once more in his room. Taking one last glance around the space, you shook your head as you entered the spacious bathroom.</p><p>The water was scalding, but he needed the distraction. His mind was slipping deeper and deeper into the void he struggled to climb out of. God, he was such an idiot, a stupid <i>fucking </i>idiot. The tears wouldn&rsquo;t stop falling, mixing with the water beads rolling down his face, breathing heavy, nose flaring.</p><p><i>They&rsquo;d wipe him soon. He knew that, and he couldn&rsquo;t stop the quell of fear that rose in his chest at the thought. Something was off about the base, it wasn\u2019t just in the confines of his mind, but in the place itself, the atmosphere. Something was changing. That was proven when the cell doors rattled with three commanding knocks.</i></p><p><i>A voice shouted through the thick door gruffly, \u201cTwo minutes, both of you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He stiffened, breathing picking up as the metal arm clicked and whirred. He could hear you shuffling and he perked up at the franticness of the sound. Turning his head, he couldn&rsquo;t stop the furrow of his brow at your panicked expression. You were sliding on your feet as you scrambled to stand from the cold floor, chest rising and falling in rapid succession. Pacing was how you spent the next minute, agitated pacing as your fingers twitched at your sides. Suddenly, you sprung towards the wall, roughly pushing away a broken chunk of it to grab something. It clinked softly as you pulled it out, the chain dangling wildly, and he took an instinctual step back when you turned to him. The desperate look in your eyes took him by surprise and froze him to the spot. You took long strides to him, hands outstretched to roughly grab his, shoving the dog tags in his palm. He was stiff, fearful eyes darting between you and the necklace as you clutched onto him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember these?\u201d You questioned shakily, shaking his hand slightly.</i></p><p><i>He seemed to think hard for a moment before nodding in confusion.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever forget these. Do you understand? Never forget these. You hold onto them with your life. This is you. These are you. Never lose that. No matter what they do to you, no matter what happens, never lose these.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He couldn&rsquo;t help but nod when the desperate tone of your voice hit his ear, taken aback by the display of emotions he was seeing, one that sharply contrasted with your normal robotic behavior. The moment was broken when the handlers returned, opening the door as they entered, calling to you to come with them. You gave him a look, silently telling him to hide the dog tags clutched in his fingers. One of the men stepped forward impatiently, hand reaching out to pull you away, and he slipped the tags into the pocket of the tattered shorts he wore. Winter moved to step back but was frozen once again when he felt your index wrap around his own. He could feel you quaking, hand shaking violently as you gave him one despaired squeeze, eyes locking with his. You had never been first to grab his finger, never the one to seek comfort first, and even when he was shaken to his core at his impending reunion with that awful machine, he felt stronger when he faced your fear. He squeezed back, confident, consoling, before he let go reluctantly and nodded for you to go where you were called.</i></p><p><i>He never saw you again.</i></p><p>The memory hit him like a truck. He&rsquo;d tried so hard to push it back, keep it from causing that familiar pain in his chest, but after confessing something to you he never thought he&rsquo;d have the misleading luxury to have and hearing nothing in return, he couldn&rsquo;t stop the images from resurfacing. So many emotions swirled around in his head: sorrow, pain, anger, betrayal, and the worst one of all, that persistent goddamn unrestrainable feeling called love. The tears were pouring down his cheeks and he let out an angered growl, the sound mixing with a sob as he brought his metal fist back and sent a punch to the wall&hellip;and right through the tiles.</p><p>You almost jumped out of your skin, a yelp escaping you as a shatter filled the shower, pieces of something hitting the tile floor at your feet. Whipping around, your jaw dropped at the sight of something silver being yanked back through the new hole in the shower wall. You swallowed thickly and took a hesitant step forward, narrowing your eyes as you took the chance and peered through the opening.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for you to decipher who it was. His head was bowed, long hair soaked from the water cascading over him, covering his face from your view. His chest was heaving, water slipping down his skin over the curves and ridges of his body, and he supported himself on the wall between you, muscles tensed. Perhaps now was an inappropriate time, seeing that he was obviously upset, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but get quite breathless at the sight. This man must have been sculpted by the goddamn <i>gods</i> because he sure looked it. Yes, you&rsquo;d seen him undressed before, privacy being a foreign concept at HYDRA, but this image was <i>very</i> unexpected, and you swallowed thickly, shifting on your feet before clearing your throat awkwardly.</p><p>His head shot up quickly, eyes wide as he stumbled back from the wall, nearly slipping. The curtain of his hair parted, swinging from the weight the water added to it, and you finally got to see his face. God you wish you hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Although the spray of water masked the tears tracking down his cheeks, his eyes told you everything. They were red and puffy, a kind of soul-crushing exhaustion, of the likes in which you had never seen, dimming the usually brilliant blue. Your arms subconsciously moved to cover your chest and you flattened your back to the wall, hiding yourself from his view. You took a deep breath, maintaining as much of your composure as you could.</p><p>\u201cGod fucking dammit..\u201d He muttered to himself bowing his head again with a great sigh.</p><p>There was a pang in your chest, a tug at the strings of your heart as you closed your eyes, a tear you didn\u2019t know you had slipped down your cheek as your lip quivered. <i>Breathe, stay in control.</i> Fat lot of good that did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the words broke through your lips on a feeble sob, hand shooting up to stem the flow before you said anything more.</p><p>Bucky froze at the sound, head rising slowly as his brows knitted together. He took a moment to breathe, replaying the noise over in his mind, processing it. That kiss was such a stupid idea, he knew that. The realization smacked him the moment it did you and it had been weighing on him since, the gravity of his actions pulling him apart from the inside, but there was a sliver of him that was sure it was all worth it. It tugged at him, yanking his head in all directions trying to get him to pull his shit together, suck it up, and own it. He kissed you, and he loved it. He took that risk, and he was going to own up to it. Whatever happens next, he can handle, as long as he\u2019s got you handling it too.</p><p>Aside from his sigh of resignation, he was silent and nodding to himself as a form of encouragement, he lifted his hand, squeezing his hand through the hole in the wall as much as he could and waited.</p><p>Normally, if he was first to extend his hand it was a silent plea for <i>your</i> reassurance, but this time, however, it felt different. Something in the way the air hung in the atmosphere, in the way your chest was tight and your breath was hitching in your throat, was different. You knew now, it was no request for comfort on his side, it was a gift of it&hellip;to you.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, you shyly lifted your hand, curling your finger around his and squeezing, desperately, and the tenseness of your finger lingered a bit too long before you relaxed and waited painstakingly to feel it reciprocated.</p><p>A second went by as Bucky debated in his own head if he should just let go, not give it back, show you what it feels like to put your heart out and get nothing back, but he mentally slapped himself for thinking like that and squeezed: Short, firm, and then relaxed.</p><p>He could hear you audible sigh in relief and he frowned at the idea that you almost <i>expected</i> him not to requite. Your finger seemed to twitch slightly, before you hesitantly pulled away, releasing him. He removed his hand from the opening and, after a moment of thought, turned off the water and got out.</p><p>When you heard the shower cut off, you peered through the hole sadly and found no one in sight.</p><p>~~<br/></p><p>You sat awkwardly on the chair at Steve\u2019s desk, constantly adjusting the clothes you\u2019d found laying on the bed when you stepped out of the bathroom. Your heart was racing despite your incessant attempts to calm it and you squirmed in your seat. Steve would return soon, and you dreaded the company he would bring. A talk was in order, a big talk, that you had no chance of opting out of.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep running, you have to face this. You played a hand in getting into this.\u201d You chastised yourself quietly, closing your eyes and adding under your breath, \u201cnot his fault you broke your one rule, Idiot.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, you rubbed your hands over your face roughly. Footsteps sounded down the hall and you tensed, straightening yourself as you prepared to face the unpleasant conversation. The door opened slowly, stopping halfway as someone spoke softly outside then continuing in its tracks as Steve walked in. He blocked the doorway, not fully entering the room as he flashed you a pitying smile.</p><p>\u201cThere are some final things I need to work out before we get moving, I need to go talk to my friends who are helping us and,\u201d Steve paused, glancing behind him quickly before he lowered his voice, \u201cI think you\u2019ve got some things to work out in private.\u201d</p><p>He sidestepped, and your heart stopped as Bucky stepped in, halting in front of Steve when his eyes met yours. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder and leaned in, head turned towards the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn,\u201d he whispered to him, giving him a stern look before patting his shoulder and leaving the two of you alone, shutting the door.</p><p>You both were at a stalemate, the air thick with unspoken words, and neither of you made any moves to speak. His gaze had dropped from yours, lowering to the ground as he shifted on his feet and cleared his throat awkwardly.</p><p>You swallowed, rising from your chair as you willed yourself to speak, and forced, \u201cBucky, I-\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand and you were silent instantly, hanging on the edge of his fingers like they pulled the very strings of your mind. Your mouth went dry and whatever you planned on saying in that moment melted away as you breathed heavily, heart pounding in your ears. His demeanor seemed to morph in phases, shifting from one emotion to another until he settled on conscientious.</p><p>Lowering his hand smoothly, he gestured for you to sit back down, taking careful steps to take his own seat on the edge of the bed. The silence hung heavy in the air but you didn&rsquo;t dare disturb it. He had complete control over the situation, something unusual for you due to the fact that by nature, you forced yourself into the position of leader, and despite your mind raging in protest, you gave the authority to him unfalteringly. The only sound that filled the room was his steadied breaths and the soft hum of his left arm as he wrung his hands in his lap. His head was bowed but for once, his hair didn&rsquo;t hide is face fore he had tucked the strands behind his ear as he lowered to the mattress, allowing you to see the intricacies of his expression as he carefully plucked the words from his mind and placed them together before opening his mouth to share the particularly formulated thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI can&rsquo;t be mad at you for backing out of whatever it was that I was trying to start. Yes, before I was. I was honestly pissed and I&rsquo;m sure you picked that up. I felt like you just ripped my heart out of my chest and I was selfish in the way I acted. I should have realized how stupid it was, how horribly timed it was&hellip;I just wanted to believe&hellip;I was <i>desperate</i> to believe we were ready for something&hellip;that you even <i>wanted</i> something between us. I should never have put words in your mouth or pushed anything on you, and I definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have said&hellip;what I said. Those aren&rsquo;t words you can just throw at someone, they&rsquo;re not easy words to digest, they weigh too much to just drop on a person, and it was wrong of me to do that. It wasn&rsquo;t fair to you. I wasn&rsquo;t right for me to put that on you,\u201d Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a deep breath before looking you in the eyes with a gentle determination, \u201cRegardless of that, I did mean it. I know to say that kind of defeats the purpose of everything I just told you but I just need to say it. I don&rsquo;t expect anything back from you, I really don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not asking you to give me anything back in return, you don&rsquo;t owe me anything, I don&rsquo;t want you to feel pressured to say it back or <i>anything</i>. It was stupid of me to say it but I don&rsquo;t&hellip;I don&rsquo;t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Time seemed to slow with every word that fell from his lips and your heart was thundering in your chest. Dizziness overtook you and you shot out your arm to grip the desk beside you. Your head was spinning, thoughts swirling at breakneck speed, grasping aimlessly at the words he&rsquo;d spoken to you, willing yourself to hold onto them and wrestle them into becoming clear to you.</p><p>Someone loves you and they don&rsquo;t regret it. Someone who knows very well the dangers that come with attachments to you, the heartbreak, the pain, someone who knows how broken you are no matter how hard you&rsquo;ve tried to hide it, <i>loves you. </i>Despite it all, they actually love you.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t realized you&rsquo;d zoned out until two strong hands planted themselves gently on you, one on your knee and the other on your cheek. You looked down, but had to blink a few times to bring his face into view, his eyebrows furrowed and a piece of his hair had fallen from its place behind his ear from the speed in which he had jumped to you.</p><p>His grip on your face was firm, forcing you to keep him in view as he whispered, \u201cHey, breathe. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t realized you were hyperventilating until his words clicked in your mind and you sucked in a deep breath, pulling your head back from his hand. Shaking your head, you brushed your hands roughly over your pants, trying to keep them from twitching.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just&hellip;I\u2019m fine. I just&hellip;God, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d you stuttered, dropping your head in your hands with an angered groan, \u201cThis is just&hellip;Listen, Barnes, I\u2019m not used to being overwhelmed, it\u2019s not normal for me. But I broke my one rule and I\u2019m freaking out. I don\u2019t get emotional and it\u2019s fucking up my brain right now. Your stupid goddamn beautiful face is screwing me up.\u201d</p><p>The muffled words tumbled from your mouth against your will, and the moment your jumbled brain caught up with reality, you gaped. Eyes going wide, you lifted your head to face his mouth opening and closing in shock. Bucky cocked his head, leaning back slightly as he replayed your words, an array of emotions crossing his face. You were close to bolting after what seemed like ages of him just staring at you before you stopped at the twitch of his lips. They began to curl into a hesitant grin, unsteady in their path up his cheeks before solidifying their place, displaying his perfect teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d A soft laugh left him, mingling with the air and his words, the smile now hard-set.</p><p>You wanted to run. God, you just wanted to jump out of that fucking window and never show your face in New York again \u00a0What the hell were you thinking saying something like that? We you some kind of idiot?</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean it&hellip;Well i did mean it i-\u201d you stammered and huffed, shoving him as you rushed, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know much about love or feelings or whatever, but I\u2026 I guess I&hellip;like you too,\u201d The hesitation in your own voice \u00a0made you cringe and you put your hand up to stop him from moving away as he frowned, \u201cGod that sounded so bad, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t even know how to say this. You&rsquo;re different to me. I know that much. I..think about you differently, I regard you differently, I interact with you differently. You&rsquo;re not just some other person to me, I know I feel at least <i>something</i> with you. Even though I\u2019m sure of that, and I\u2019m sorry for this, I don&rsquo;t think I can say..you know what back, at least not yet. Don\u2019t take that the wrong way, please, I\u2019m just worried about starting something that won\u2019t end well between us. I only have a few rules for myself, but this one is huge, it\u2019s my biggest rule, and I\u2019m shattering it. \u00a0I made those rules to protect myself because I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. My whole life\u2019s been a shit show and..meeting you was the best thing to ever come out of it. I don&rsquo;t want to lose you too. If I tell you I love you and then I find I can\u2019t keep that up, I\u2019ll never forgive myself for dragging you through that pain. Please understand, James. I do care about you, and you mean a hell of a lot to me, and maybe..maybe I truly do love you, but I\u2019m not ready to say that yet.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things you\u2019ve done in this world, all the missions, escaping, being on the run, and staying alive, you began to wonder if they even compared to this moment right here. This was the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever down in your life: Share pure, personal, honesty. You wondered if the fear was evident on your face, if he could see the stop of your chest as you held your breath, waiting. It felt like your whole existence was riding on this moment, on his response. You supposed, in a way it did, due in part to the fact that if he rejects you, your only support in this would be destroyed and you\u2019d be thrown in a prison and forgotten. It\u2019s funny, how life plays the string of irony, turning the tables on things you thought you knew. You\u2019d only ever had two purposes in life, the line between them somehow vaguely blurred: Protector and executioner. But now, as you sat in your seat, feeling your world crack with each second that ticked by, you were neither one nor the other. Your life and the very strings that held it together were now the targets, and you waited to see which purpose Bucky would fulfill; would he patch these ripping threads back together, or make the final cut to destroy them forever?</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, he finally stirred the stagnant air, leaning back and nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he started, a gentle smile tugging at his lips, \u201cI can work with \u2018maybe.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A warm sensation began to spread through your chest, one you couldn&rsquo;t place. It was unfamiliar, new, and never before experienced but every single fiber of the feeling was wonderfully indescribable. It felt as if someone had filled every little crack and healed every little imperfection of your scarred heart with a gentle kiss of sunshine. You wondered if it was glowing through your chest, rattling against your bones with an insatiable urge to leap from you and kiss the star that eased its ache. That tired organ deserved as much, so you appeased it&rsquo;s desire and pressed it close to that perfect sun.</p><p>The action surprised you both, but you made no attempt to stop yourself as you launched from your chair and wrapped your arms firmly around the man in front of you, squeezing like your life depended on it. In a way, it did, so you gripped a little stronger and let out a breath. The warmth grew when his own arms curled around you, his soft chuckle kissing your ear as the cool metal of his fingers carded through your hair, holding you safely against him, pressing your hearts as close as possible. You could have sworn you felt yours reaching for his, as his own beat softly through you, playing with the rhythm of your rejuvenated heart.</p><p>\u201cI owe you everything,\u201d you breathed out, words weaving through the strands of his hair that your face had nuzzled itself into.</p><p>He pressed his face softly into your shoulder, and you weren&rsquo;t sure if you were imagining things, or if you truly felt his lips place a feather light kiss upon it before he spoke, his voice addictingly gravely, \u201cYes you do. And I know exactly how you can pay me back,\u201d you started to lift your head to look at him but he held you firmly in place as he continued, \u201cLive your life the way you want to, make yourself happy, and don&rsquo;t let fear stop you from that. Make bold choices, take risks! That\u2019s where the fun is at!\u201d</p><p>You pulled back to look at him and teased, \u201cWell, now you&rsquo;re just stealing my lines.\u201d</p><p>He let out a laugh, an airy chuckle that floated through the air softly and lightened the atmosphere of the room. It was contagious, and soon a similar sound escaped you as your hands slid down his arms to rest on his hands, squeezing them gently. Your mind drifted from the present- Was this what home felt like? The weight on your shoulders and the burden on your mind seemed bearable now, easier, and for once, letting your walls down didn\u2019t seem so scary. With the man in front of you to stand guard, you were always&hellip;safe.</p><p>That was the first time in your life you\u2019d ever really believed that.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get going,\u201d you started reluctantly, not wanting to break the moment, but you knew no more time could be wasted, \u201cRogers is probably ready to go.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, smile still present on his lips as he looked down at your hands clasped together, nodding, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We need to get you out of here before the rest of the team realizes you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>He stood slowly from the ground, looking down with a blissful grin, extending his hand. You took it gratefully, and the both of you collected yourselves to regroup with Steve.</p><p>~~</p><p>Bucky had received a text to meet Steve and the others in the hangar, and after carefully sneaking your way there, the two of you stood in front of a whirring jet, the ramp resting on the ground. Steve stood at the foot of it, alongside Sam Wilson and a young girl you just barely recognized as Wanda Maximoff, who seemed to tense slightly at the sight of you. Keeping your expression neutral and your distance generous, you gave a curt nod of acknowledgment to the group.</p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve greeted, before turning to you and making brief introductions, \u201c(Y/N), this is Sam Wilson, who you\u2019ve met, and Wanda Maximoff, who I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve made each other\u2019s acquaintances. They\u2019re our help on the inside, they\u2019ll do whatever they can to keep the heat off of us and keep the team off our trail.\u201d</p><p>You piled the bricks of your mental walls up quickly, making sure each one was in its own perfect spot before closing the space between you and Steve\u2019s friends, extending your hand in salutation. Wilson reciprocated quickly, a firm but short handshake that was accompanied unexpectedly by a flirtatious smirk and a wink sent in the direction of Bucky behind you. Your eyes narrowed as you pulled your hand back with a bite of irritation and moved on to the girl beside him. Her interaction contrasted greatly with Sam\u2019s, her moves calculated but performed with hesitation, her guard up as high as it could go. You wondered if perhaps her trepidation was not only a result of your reputation but from her extraordinary ability to read minds, leading her to see first hand what was only scrawled into files that barely scratched the surface of the true nature of their horrors. It was better not to worry yourself with things you couldn&rsquo;t control, so you tucked the thought away and forced a quick smile, ending the handshake and locking your stance back again.</p><p>After the awkward exchange, Steve cut all interactions short, thanking his friends a few more times for the help before ushering you and Bucky onto the jet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to move quickly, before the team finds out you\u2019re gone.\u201d Steve rushed, directing the both of you up the ramp.</p><p>He entered last, sending a wave to his friends who returned the gesture as the ramp lifted to a close.</p><p>The craft was different from the ones you\u2019d seen, bigger in every way. The ramp connected to the side rather than the back, and further towards the end of the jet was a few separate cabins, one you assumed was for sleeping and the like. A very small medical \u201ccenter\u201d was tucked into the corner off the main area, across from the seats and weapons holder. Three stuffed duffel bags sat on the cot, lined up in a row. You raised an eyebrow, barely getting the chance to point at them before Steve started.</p><p>\u201cYou two are trouble,\u201d he scolded, \u201cI\u2019d be insane to send you both off into hiding without me.\u201d</p><p>You smirked slightly at him, a quiet huff leaving you as you walked towards the back of the jet. You wanted to fall into a more carefree feeling, but something felt off and you noticed the distance between the two best friends behind you.</p><p>Bucky seemed to keep space between him and Steve, a lost look on his face that conflicted with the sureness of his posture. Agitation was evident in his body language, clenching fists hung at his sides, shoulders hunched slightly as he breathed with a steady heaviness. The blonde turned to him with a questioning look but was only met with silence as Bucky shook his head to himself and yanked the duffel bag from its place, moving to toss it into the back.</p><p>Confused, you glanced at him, wordlessly asking if he was alright. His eyes met yours, and with an expression of determination, he turned back around to face Steve.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), your bag\u2019s on the left, go pick a cot,\u201d Bucky didn\u2019t so much as side eye you, and the commanding tone of his voice left no room for argument. Silently, you grabbed the bag, excusing yourself quietly from the uncomfortable atmosphere and practically running to the back room, desperate to remove yourself from in between the now growing tension.</p><p>Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a few deep breaths as he shifted on his feet. Steve fought back the urge to ask him questions, finding it the better idea to wait and let the man speak first. Something troubling was obviously on his mind, and out of respect of that, Rogers remained unspeaking, allowing his friend to formulate his words.</p><p>It took a few tries, his mouth opening and closing a few times before he finally started to speak, \u201cI appreciate the help, Steve, I really do, we\u2019d be screwed without it, but I just&hellip; Something is on my mind and I just can\u2019t shake it.\u201d His tone slowly started to grow in anger, a seed of disappointment rooted in the center as he lifted his head to bore his gaze into Steve\u2019s, \u201cYou knew about the plan to arrest her. You were there when it was spelled out&hellip;but how fucking long did you know before we got back? Why the hell didn\u2019t you warn me before so I could have avoided it all together? I could have just waited it out. She never would have been shoved in that cage, we could have saved her all that stress. Steve, we..\u201d he paused, breathing fast in exasperation, \u201cWe could have screwed up everything. I could have lost whatever trust she had in me. I never would have gotten that back.\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned, unable to even get a syllable out before Bucky seemed to come to another revelation, a sadness beginning to entwine itself with his vexation, \u201cYou knew I&hellip;Y-you knew I loved her. I didn\u2019t have to say it. You knew I <i>loved</i> her, while you sat in that meeting and listened to them plan to cage her like an animal, and you couldn\u2019t even spare me a heads up?\u201d</p><p>The man let out a great sigh, shoulders slumping in defeat as he shook his head, \u201cBucky, I\u2026\u201d words seemed to escape him, a sick feeling rising from the pit of his soul, but he owed his friend a great deal for his mistakes, so he pushed the sounds out of his mouth, \u201cI can\u2019t say anything that will fix this, I know that. I have no explanation for you, I can\u2019t apologize hard enough, or describe how awful I feel. You\u2019re my best friend, and I let you down. I betrayed you. I should have warned you, but I was acting like a total dumbass. I\u2019m sorry, Bucky. But I am going to make it up to you. I swear on my life. Starting right now, whatever you need, whatever <i>she</i> needs, I\u2019m here. I will fight as hard for her as I fought for you and that\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to stay angry, a part of him wanted to scream, call Steve every name in the book, but the pure sincerity in his friend\u2019s aura calmed the feeling. He radiated the very definition of the word earnest and Bucky could no longer hold the man in front of him in contempt. The tension in his body slowly left with every breath that filtered through his lungs, but he kept his head lowered, keeping his face shielded by his hair so he could work through his thoughts by himself. Steve watched with anticipation to see if his words got through to Barnes, and soon felt a wave of relief wash over him when the man nodded, raising his head to look into his eyes with a soft smile of forgiveness.</p><p>Steve stepped forward, pulling him into a firm hug, which Bucky reciprocated tiredly. It dawned on him, the pure exhaustion in the Soldier\u2019s features, and with a final pat on the back, he gestured him towards the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flying, Buck. You two should get some rest.\u201d He nodded towards the closed door behind which you stood, ear pressed to the metal.</p><p>When you heard Bucky agree and his footsteps start towards you, you darted from the door, standing in front of your cot and pretending to rummage through your bag. He stepped through with a heavy sigh, closing the door as he bent over to grab his own bag from the floor and tossing it onto the bed across from yours.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, I just&hellip;needed to talk about something.\u201d He flashed you an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d you flashed him a smile in return, but it faltered at the corners of your lips, and you turned your head away from him.</p><p>A frown took over Bucky\u2019s face, and he crossed his arms, leaning against his bed, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>It was a simple question really, so why did you have such a hard time answering it? Those words, those small, unimpressive words weighed heavily on your shoulders and you struggled to find the way to reply.</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it to you?\u201d You started softly, hesitantly turning to face him, \u201cAm&hellip;<i>I</i> worth it to you? This is a lot of trouble you and Steve are going through for me and I\u2019m just not sure if I\u2019m worth it. Maybe it would be best for me to just get dropped off somewhere, give me a headstart, and I\u2019ll just go back on the run. It would probably be easiest. I can be gone in seconds, get out of your hair. I\u2019ve already stupidly let myself settle in too much.\u201d</p><p>Your fingers were twitching at your sides, and you clasped your hands in front of you to stop them. You were divided in your own mind, one half of you was sure this was the right decision. The rules you set for yourself and the walls you built were your protection, and keeping them together was the right thing to do, no matter what you sacrificed. But on the other side, you were screaming on the inside, telling yourself to <b><i>just shut up.</i></b> That half of you was aching, reaching out to Bucky and hoping beyond all hope he\u2019d look at you like you were crazy and completely disregard your suggestion. And, as if for once in your life the stars shined above you and fate wished something other than ill upon you, he did exactly that.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he took a bewildered step forward, arms uncrossing as his eyebrow shot up, \u201cAbsolutely not. (Y/N), I know you\u2019re not used to all this but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve gotta run from it. I\u2019m <i>not</i> letting you run from it. Do you really want to go back to that life? Back on the run?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, you stuttered, \u201cN-no I just..I-I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><p>Panic was a strange and unusual sensation, and it took you a few seconds to realize its unique feeling. Your breathing picked up slightly, mouth running dry as you wrung your fingers together. You were going against everything you\u2019d learned over the course of your life, <i>again</i>, and it sent your brain into chaos. If it were a computer, you\u2019re sure it would have short-circuited and exploded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just still conflicted, Bucky. I\u2019m sorry. I hate taking you on this loop but it\u2019s all just so new to me and my nerves are fried. Everything I\u2019ve learned trying to survive all my life is in direct contradiction to everything I\u2019m doing right now and it\u2019s really crossing my wires here. I don\u2019t want to be on the run anymore. I really don\u2019t. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I\u2019m so fucking tired of running. I want&hellip;I\u2019ve dreamed of a normal life since I was allowed to let my thoughts wander without getting thrown back into that god awful chair. I know this is my chance. But I never thought I\u2019d get it and now that it\u2019s here I\u2019m&hellip;I\u2019m not as ready as I thought I\u2019d be to take it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply, gesturing for you to sit. After a moment\u2019s contemplation, you obliged and to your surprise, he moved to sit next to you, plopping down beside you. He took a moment to collect his thoughts before speaking.</p><p>\u201cListen, Doll, I know what you\u2019re going through. I went through the same thing when Steve showed up at my apartment in Bucharest. Again, my whole life got flipped on its head and I had no idea what to do, what decisions to make. At first, even I ran from it. Literally. I didn\u2019t expect it. I was&hellip;honestly, I was scared, terrified even, and I almost let that chance of a new life slip away. If I wasn\u2019t stopped, even though it wasn\u2019t in good circumstances, I would have got away and never turned back. I never would have reunited with Steve, never would have recovered, met the team. I would have lost my second chance. I can\u2019t imagine if that happened.\u201d He paused for a moment, nodding to himself as if it would help to push the words out, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you miss your chance. You deserve it more than I can say and I\u2019ll do anything to ensure you get it. I know you\u2019re scared, even though you won\u2019t admit that, but I\u2019m here for you. Hell, Steve is here for you. We\u2019re going to fight for you until the team sees what we see, and then we\u2019re going to help you recover. You\u2019ll get the same programs, opportunities, and resources that I had.\u201d</p><p>You stared at the ground for a moment, processing the words, \u201cBut I don\u2019t&hellip;But, James, I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>The speed in which Bucky whipped his head towards you made you jump. His hand came to rest firmly on your leg as he asserted, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that. You do deserve it, completely deserve it. And I know you want it, so take it. Your past doesn\u2019t matter, (Y/N), it wasn\u2019t up to you. HYDRA can suck it, because you\u2019re getting your second chance. No ifs, ands, or buts. Darlin\u2019, you\u2019re a good person, no matter what you think, and I\u2019m going to make sure your future reflects that.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, with the intensity of his electric blue eyes, it seemed impossible to tear your gaze from his. There was an unfamiliar sting behind your eyes and your breath hitched in your throat. An urge overtook you that you couldn\u2019t fight, and you threw yourself on him, wrapping your arms tightly around his neck in an awkward hug. He shifted on the mattress to better the angle as he encased you in his hold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to run anymore.\u201d you whimpered softly into his shoulder, fingers digging a little harder into his shirt, \u201cI want someone to care. I\u2019m tired of being a background character in my own life. I\u2019m tired of always having to hide. I don\u2019t want to be invisible just until someone needs something from me. I just want someone to <i>see me. </i>I just\u2026I just want someone to care. <i> </i>\u201d</p><p>When the fabric of his clothes began to dampen against his skin, he tightened his hold, and couldn\u2019t stop himself from planting a kiss to the side of your head, \u201cI see you, Doll, I see you. And I care about you, so fucking much. You don\u2019t have to be invisible anymore. You\u2019re safe with me. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you know,\u201d you hiccupped, taking a breath, \u201cyou know you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever met who\u2019s been there for me. I\u2019ve never had someone&hellip;comfort me before. After that nightmare in Germany&hellip;I tried to forget it and pretend it didn\u2019t happen, but that meant something to me. That was the first time in my life someone comforted me, truly comforted me. It changed things for me. It was such a strange feeling but it was&hellip;it was an amazing feeling. I felt like someone was seeing <i>me</i> and not the mask I was wearing to hide behind,\u201d you paused, taking in the scent of him in hopes it would give you the courage to get your next words out, \u201cBucky,\u201d he hummed when you stopped again, hand sliding down your back to rest on your hip, \u201cYou make me feel like me again.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened underneath you, and he felt like his heart shot a line out to yours and, for the first time, your heart caught it and held it tightly. He was speechless, a joyous warmth feeling his whole being.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he barely registered your gentle voice before he felt you plant a soft, sweet kiss to his cheek, sliding off his lap and padding gently to the bathroom.</p><p>His skin began turning a deep shade of pink that covered his neck and cheeks and seeped into his bones as he sat lost in a lovesick stupor.</p><p>You stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes, drying the tears that had fallen down your cheeks and just breathed. Looking into the mirror, you nodded to yourself, taking a moment to make peace with the path you were choosing to go down. This choice gives you the greatest opportunity for a good future, you\u2019d regret not making it. Nodding firmly to yourself, you exited the room shyly.</p><p>Bucky was leaning over his bed, rummaging through his duffel bag when you reentered, and he turned to flash you a kind smile. Returning the gesture came almost automatically, and you walked silently over to your own.</p><p>Clearing your throat, your let out a soft laugh and joked, \u201cThis is the part where I make a funny remark and pretend I wasn\u2019t just crying like a little bitch a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>He grinned delicately and sighed in an almost blissed out way, \u201cYou\u2019re not a \u2018little bitch\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping here, I\u2019m trying to be sarcastic and avoidant of my humanity,\u201d you quipped.</p><p>His smile widened with a small laugh. He opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by a yawn that broke free from your lips. You shot your hand up to stifle the noise and Bucky couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was just about to say how tired I was, guess you agree with me.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled with a nod, shoving the duffel off the bed and plopping down on it to take your shoes off.</p><p>The both of you proceeded to get ready to sleep, exchange glances and little giggles back and forth before deciding you were ready to hit the hay.</p><p>Bucky turned off the lights after you had settled under your covers, shuffling around a bit more before laying down in his own bed.</p><p>Silence filled the darkness for a few seconds before he broke it again, \u201cSo, I have a question.\u201d</p><p>You picked yourself up from your bed slightly, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Germany,\u201d he started, and the sound of his rustling sheets filled the air as he turned in your direction, \u201cDo you actually cuddle in your sleep or was that all you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Bucky, you\u2019re insufferable,\u201d you scoffed, rolling your eyes despite his inability to see and plopped back into mattress before teasing sarcastically, \u201cCrawl into my bed in the middle of the night and find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0tempt me, Sugar.\u201d</p><p><b><a href=\"http://orderofthefanfic.tumblr.com/post/180962328283\">Next part</a></b></p>",

We can\u2019t do this.\u201d You stuttered on the words, breath picking up rapidly.</p><p>You could almost hear his heart shatter, the look on his face created an aching in your chest and for the first time since Manarola, yours shattered too. Even after watching this man be beaten and broken and torn apart and utterly destroyed, you\u2019d never seen a pain as deep seeded and decimating as the kind that shadowed his face in that very moment. His bright, blue eyes seemed to darken as a pit opened in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean you can\u2019t do this?\u201d God his voice felt like someone was cutting the strings of your heart one by one, the tremor and crack and absolute brokenness of the sound filling your veins with a blackness you knew you would never be able to wash away again. \u201cYou kissed me back. You felt it too. I-I know you felt it too.\u201d</p><p>Bucky could feel the sting behind his eyes as his mouth went dry and he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t fucking<i> breathe. </i>His world was cracked right down the middle and it continued to splinter as you stared, unmoving, in front of him. You must have felt it too, he was desperate to hear you admit it. He was desperate to not be the only one. He loved you, and he needed you to love him back. So much so, that the urge forced words from his mouth that burned when they left his lips, ached when they hit the air because they didn\u2019t want to enter a world where you wouldn\u2019t except them.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Time stopped, everything stopped, and in that moment, it was just you and him, the only people in the world. He loved you, and no matter how much you wanted and tried to say it back, the words wouldn\u2019t leave you. A sickeningly dense silence filled the room.</p><p>\u201cB-Bucky I\u2026I-I\u2026\u201d you stuttered, tripping on words as your mind raced. You watched with pain as his eyes began to brim with tears and he took a distressed step forward.</p><p>You were both interrupted by the door opening and Steve Rogers slipped into the room, stopping short as he saw the interaction before him. In a ditch attempt to escape the situation, you flashed him a pleading look and the moment his eyes locked on the tear-stained cheeks of his best friend, he snapped into action. Long strides carried him to Bucky, hands gripping his shoulders as he forced him back.</p><p>Gesturing out with his head, he rushed, \u201cGo to my room, it\u2019s next door, F.R.I.D.A.Y. will let you in. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes were locked on you, red and puffy, and they gave him the expression of a kicked puppy. A whispered shaky apology escaped your lips as you began to rush from the room, stumbling on your own feet.</p><p>\u201cI said I love you. I love you.\u201d he was calling out to you as you fled, choking back sobs as he began to shout, \u201cI love you goddammit, say something! Say something!\u2026P-Please..\u201d</p><p>His yells succeeded in cracking the walls you held up so hopelessly, and once the door to Rogers\u2019s room shut behind you, tears poured down your cheeks as you backed into the wall, sliding down into a heap on the floor and burying your face in your hands.</p><p>~~</p><p>After you had left the room, Bucky slowly started shutting down, forcing his emotions back into his mind, and going completely soundless. Steve had tried to get an explanation out of him, anything to understand what he walked in on, but he quickly discovered he was wasting his time. The man was silent, vacant eyes staring at the wall in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou should go take a shower, clear your head. I\u2019ll go talk to her, work out what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Steve was pulling clothes out of drawers and placing them on the bed, pushing Bucky out of his chair gently and towards the bathroom.</p><p>He didn\u2019t put up much of a protest, grumbling quietly as he shuffled to the bathroom and slammed the door behind him. Steve let out a sigh, gazing at the closed room for a few seconds before he reluctantly headed for his room to speak with you.</p><p>You had picked yourself up from the floor weakly, aggressively rubbing away the tears with a sniffle. Taking the first look around the Captain\u2019s room, you studied it, gathering a brief understanding of the man behind the shield. It was odd, someone who evidently didn\u2019t trust you, allowing you in such a private place without hesitation. It was obviously in the interest of his friend, but something in the way he looked at you felt oddly\u2026comforting, like this invitation to his room was a way of sheltering <i>you</i> and not just the exposed heart of Bucky. It was much more personalized than the soldier\u2019s, pictures littered the walls and the colors were a bit less muted. The style was practical, yet characterized in its own unique way. You walked slowly away from the door, fingers gently grazing the top of his dresser, eyes scanning the photos there. The hitch in your breath when you inhaled forced you to stop, bowing your head as you took calming breaths through your nose. You stood that way for a moment, before rubbing away the remaining tears and making your way to the window. The city was lit up in the darkness of the night, windows illuminated in perfect rows down the length of the many skyscrapers looming on the horizon. The thick glass of the panels blocked out any sounds from the streets, headlights passed by silently, and occasionally the pattern of the lights on the buildings would change. You watched the scene mutely, but inside, your mind was screaming.</p><p>A noise behind you whipped your attention away from the window as Steve cleared his throat behind you. You didn\u2019t hear him come in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I walked into, or what was happening, but we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Those words were never good, not in your experience, and you closed your eyes with a sigh. Alone, for the first time in a long time, you couldn\u2019t help but let the tears fall, but you\u2019d be damned if you let that wall down in front of Steve Rogers. Taking in a deep breath, you straighten your posture, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what there is to talk about, Spangles,\u201d you shot, but your voice faltered as you added, \u201cThat was a private matter, that evidently didn\u2019t go very well.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face, an agitated sigh leaving his lips, \u201cI\u2026you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>It felt like someone switched a breaker in your mind. It sizzled and popped like a TV without a signal. You must have been hearing things because there is no way in the infinite possibilities of universes that America\u2019s Golden Boy, Captain America himself, just agreed with you. Your eyebrow rose to the roof.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, you\u2019re right,\u201d he repeated, nodding his head before he pulled the seat from under the table and motioned for you to sit on the bed, \u201cSo we\u2019ll talk about something else. Cause if I\u2019m going to help you, I need to get to know you. Bucky is convinced you\u2019re not what HYDRA made you, but I need you to prove that to me.\u201d</p><p>You hardened your expression, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat. Your mind flashed back to Bucky, the broken expression that took over his features when you failed to say those three words back. Steve did not hold your trust in the slightest, but he <i>was</i> Bucky\u2019s friend, and after seeing the heartbreak in that man\u2019s eyes that <i>you</i> caused, you\u2019d do anything to fix it, even if that meant opening up to Steve Rogers.</p><p>Letting out a sigh, you slowly sat on the bed, folding your hands on your lap and looking up to meet his eyes, \u201cWhat do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cWhen you first got here, he said he owed you. What for?\u201d Steve was careful with his tone, watching your fingers twitch in your lap as he softened his expression slightly.</p><p><i>It wasn\u2019t exactly a rare occasion to share a cell with the other asset and the both of you had grown quite accustomed to sharing your space. It was a normal night by your standards and you sat on the floor, gazing blankly at the dirty concrete. A shuffle dragged your attention into your surroundings and you looked up to see Winter standing strangely in the middle of the cell, illuminated by the light beam from the barred viewport, hair even more disheveled than usual, hands out in front of him as he seemed entranced by the sight of them, flipping them over and over as his ragged breathing entered your ear. You furrowed your brows, rising slowly from the ground as you cautiously lifted your hands at the ready. He looked up, an uncharacteristic panic in his eyes as he took an aggressive step forward.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not the Winter Soldier.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The words made you freeze, mind clicking as you swallowed thickly. He repeated himself with more force, a determination filling him that you had never seen. It had been a long time since either of you had been wiped and the programming was wearing thinner and thinner. His seemed to have cracked and it spurred a ridge in your own. Everything in your mind was screaming for you to stop what you were doing, but it wasn\u2019t strong enough as you bent down, pushing a broken chunk of concrete out of the way to grab what was hidden behind it. Something was pulling at you, desperately trying to stop you from moving towards him, stop you from doing this because it was a risk you weren\u2019t sure was worth taking. For the first time, you fought against your better judgment, trading survival for sympathy as you stepped towards him. He was hesitant, but the look you gave him locked him in a trance. You reached him, wordlessly asking permission before you took his hands in yours gently, flipping the palms up before placing the object in his grasp. The metal was cold on his skin, the chain dangling between his fingers, and he looked in shock between you and his hands. You covered his hand with your own, looking him in the eye deeply as the dog tags warmed between your fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThese are yours. I found them in the archives. I\u2026kept them. I don\u2019t know why, but I did. They belong to you though. Keep these safe. No matter what happens, no matter what they do to you, you keep these.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2026W-What are they?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey\u2019re you. These are your dog tags. Your name is Bucky. And you\u2019re not the Winter Soldier.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou had his dog tags? How? Why?\u201d There was an expression on Steve\u2019s face you couldn\u2019t quite place. It was mixed between sadness, confusion, and\u2026relief? Happiness? The word to describe it escaped you, and you slid your gaze from his piercing blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI found them in the archives when I was\u2026When I was looking for my own files, which I never found. I don\u2019t know why I kept them, honestly, I don\u2019t,\u201d you cleared your throat, desperate to keep your composure, \u201cand I don\u2019t know why I gave them to him. But he <i>did</i> keep them. Right where I hid them. He still has them, he had them when he was wiped before he fought you on the helicarriers. They kept a piece of him alive and he owed me for that. I\u2019ve already cashed my check and he paid the bill. I don\u2019t want anything else from him.\u201d</p><p>There was a strange feeling in your chest with those last words, as if you were trying to convince the man in front of you wholeheartedly that you didn\u2019t want any more from Bucky Barnes. Why you felt the need to say it was beyond you.</p><p>Steve only nodded, finally breaking the hold his gaze held over you as he looked away with a thick swallow. The gears seemed to be turning in his head, reeling up another question.</p><p>\u201cWhen I broke you out,\u201d his words were slow, the cogs in his head working double time to make the words come out right, before he backtracked in his question, \u201cyou didn\u2019t trust me, I know you <i>don\u2019t</i> trust me, but all it took was for me to say \u2018I\u2019m on Bucky\u2019s side\u2019 to get you to follow me. I know you\u2019re not stupid, I know you know, as well as I do, that I very well could have been lying to you. I could have been making things worse. Why did you give in so easily?\u201d</p><p>You were slightly taken aback by the question, pausing to blink a few times as you breathed in and out, calculating your response carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Steve, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d you held back your own shock at the softness of your tone, Steve had evidently noticed the change because he shifted in his chair, expression easing just the tiniest bit of tension, \u201cI can see how much you matter to Bucky and you\u2019ve shown me <i>many</i> times how much he matters to you. He\u2019s the closest thing I have to an ally right now and I need to take what I can get. I know when I\u2019m had, I know when I\u2019m screwed. If I have to swallow my pride and follow the man who had me arrested,\u201d you added with a bite of irritation, but it faded, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. If Bucky trust you\u2026then I\u2019ll have to trust you, too.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t respond. His eyes were fixed on your hands, twiddling in your lap as he pushed out a breath.</p><p>He inhaled sharply, adjusting his posture as he stood, nodding and eased, \u201cOkay. That works for me.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrow shot to the roof as you rose with him, \u201cWait, what? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d a soft smile pull at his previous hardened expression, \u201clook, I can see what Bucky sees. There\u2019s more to you than your files, I see that now. I made the wrong call with you, and now I want to make up for that.\u201d</p><p>Silence was all you gave him, eyes boring into his, searching for a hint of deceit as you fought the drop of your jaw. Even when you tried to speak, you stuttered on your words, tripping over every syllable. His hand rose to stop you, shaking his head with a gentle smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get moving. We can\u2019t stay here forever. I\u2019ll get the team to come around but until then it\u2019s best if you\u2019re not here. I\u2019ll get the plan finalized and we\u2019ll all talk about it,\u201d he watched you twitch at the words and he repeated firmly, \u201cWe\u2019ll <i>all</i> talk about it.\u201d</p><p>You merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d his tone changed as he started towards the door, \u201cYou should take some time, freshen up, relax. You can use my shower. I\u2019ll have clothes here for you when you\u2019re done, then we\u2019ll work everything out.\u201d</p><p>You opened your mouth to protest but he stopped you with a pointed look.</p><p>You heard a sigh and dropped your shoulders, waving him off as you moved towards the bathroom and relented, \u201cWhatever, Stars and Stripes.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed quietly with a smile and exited the room, leaving you alone once more in his room. Taking one last glance around the space, you shook your head as you entered the spacious bathroom.</p><p>The water was scalding, but he needed the distraction. His mind was slipping deeper and deeper into the void he struggled to climb out of. God, he was such an idiot, a stupid <i>fucking </i>idiot. The tears wouldn\u2019t stop falling, mixing with the water beads rolling down his face, breathing heavy, nose flaring.</p><p><i>They\u2019d wipe him soon. He knew that, and he couldn\u2019t stop the quell of fear that rose in his chest at the thought. Something was off about the base, it wasn\u2019t just in the confines of his mind, but in the place itself, the atmosphere. Something was changing. That was proven when the cell doors rattled with three commanding knocks.</i></p><p><i>A voice shouted through the thick door gruffly, \u201cTwo minutes, both of you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He stiffened, breathing picking up as the metal arm clicked and whirred. He could hear you shuffling and he perked up at the franticness of the sound. Turning his head, he couldn\u2019t stop the furrow of his brow at your panicked expression. You were sliding on your feet as you scrambled to stand from the cold floor, chest rising and falling in rapid succession. Pacing was how you spent the next minute, agitated pacing as your fingers twitched at your sides. Suddenly, you sprung towards the wall, roughly pushing away a broken chunk of it to grab something. It clinked softly as you pulled it out, the chain dangling wildly, and he took an instinctual step back when you turned to him. The desperate look in your eyes took him by surprise and froze him to the spot. You took long strides to him, hands outstretched to roughly grab his, shoving the dog tags in his palm. He was stiff, fearful eyes darting between you and the necklace as you clutched onto him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember these?\u201d You questioned shakily, shaking his hand slightly.</i></p><p><i>He seemed to think hard for a moment before nodding in confusion.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever forget these. Do you understand? Never forget these. You hold onto them with your life. This is you. These are you. Never lose that. No matter what they do to you, no matter what happens, never lose these.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t help but nod when the desperate tone of your voice hit his ear, taken aback by the display of emotions he was seeing, one that sharply contrasted with your normal robotic behavior. The moment was broken when the handlers returned, opening the door as they entered, calling to you to come with them. You gave him a look, silently telling him to hide the dog tags clutched in his fingers. One of the men stepped forward impatiently, hand reaching out to pull you away, and he slipped the tags into the pocket of the tattered shorts he wore. Winter moved to step back but was frozen once again when he felt your index wrap around his own. He could feel you quaking, hand shaking violently as you gave him one despaired squeeze, eyes locking with his. You had never been first to grab his finger, never the one to seek comfort first, and even when he was shaken to his core at his impending reunion with that awful machine, he felt stronger when he faced your fear. He squeezed back, confident, consoling, before he let go reluctantly and nodded for you to go where you were called.</i></p><p><i>He never saw you again.</i></p><p>The memory hit him like a truck. He\u2019d tried so hard to push it back, keep it from causing that familiar pain in his chest, but after confessing something to you he never thought he\u2019d have the misleading luxury to have and hearing nothing in return, he couldn\u2019t stop the images from resurfacing. So many emotions swirled around in his head: sorrow, pain, anger, betrayal, and the worst one of all, that persistent goddamn unrestrainable feeling called love. The tears were pouring down his cheeks and he let out an angered growl, the sound mixing with a sob as he brought his metal fist back and sent a punch to the wall\u2026and right through the tiles.</p><p>You almost jumped out of your skin, a yelp escaping you as a shatter filled the shower, pieces of something hitting the tile floor at your feet. Whipping around, your jaw dropped at the sight of something silver being yanked back through the new hole in the shower wall. You swallowed thickly and took a hesitant step forward, narrowing your eyes as you took the chance and peered through the opening.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for you to decipher who it was. His head was bowed, long hair soaked from the water cascading over him, covering his face from your view. His chest was heaving, water slipping down his skin over the curves and ridges of his body, and he supported himself on the wall between you, muscles tensed. Perhaps now was an inappropriate time, seeing that he was obviously upset, but you couldn\u2019t help but get quite breathless at the sight. This man must have been sculpted by the goddamn <i>gods</i> because he sure looked it. Yes, you\u2019d seen him undressed before, privacy being a foreign concept at HYDRA, but this image was <i>very</i> unexpected, and you swallowed thickly, shifting on your feet before clearing your throat awkwardly.</p><p>His head shot up quickly, eyes wide as he stumbled back from the wall, nearly slipping. The curtain of his hair parted, swinging from the weight the water added to it, and you finally got to see his face. God you wish you hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Although the spray of water masked the tears tracking down his cheeks, his eyes told you everything. They were red and puffy, a kind of soul-crushing exhaustion, of the likes in which you had never seen, dimming the usually brilliant blue. Your arms subconsciously moved to cover your chest and you flattened your back to the wall, hiding yourself from his view. You took a deep breath, maintaining as much of your composure as you could.</p><p>\u201cGod fucking dammit..\u201d He muttered to himself bowing his head again with a great sigh.</p><p>There was a pang in your chest, a tug at the strings of your heart as you closed your eyes, a tear you didn\u2019t know you had slipped down your cheek as your lip quivered. <i>Breathe, stay in control.</i> Fat lot of good that did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the words broke through your lips on a feeble sob, hand shooting up to stem the flow before you said anything more.</p><p>Bucky froze at the sound, head rising slowly as his brows knitted together. He took a moment to breathe, replaying the noise over in his mind, processing it. That kiss was such a stupid idea, he knew that. The realization smacked him the moment it did you and it had been weighing on him since, the gravity of his actions pulling him apart from the inside, but there was a sliver of him that was sure it was all worth it. It tugged at him, yanking his head in all directions trying to get him to pull his shit together, suck it up, and own it. He kissed you, and he loved it. He took that risk, and he was going to own up to it. Whatever happens next, he can handle, as long as he\u2019s got you handling it too.</p><p>Aside from his sigh of resignation, he was silent and nodding to himself as a form of encouragement, he lifted his hand, squeezing his hand through the hole in the wall as much as he could and waited.</p><p>Normally, if he was first to extend his hand it was a silent plea for <i>your</i> reassurance, but this time, however, it felt different. Something in the way the air hung in the atmosphere, in the way your chest was tight and your breath was hitching in your throat, was different. You knew now, it was no request for comfort on his side, it was a gift of it\u2026to you.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, you shyly lifted your hand, curling your finger around his and squeezing, desperately, and the tenseness of your finger lingered a bit too long before you relaxed and waited painstakingly to feel it reciprocated.</p><p>A second went by as Bucky debated in his own head if he should just let go, not give it back, show you what it feels like to put your heart out and get nothing back, but he mentally slapped himself for thinking like that and squeezed: Short, firm, and then relaxed.</p><p>He could hear you audible sigh in relief and he frowned at the idea that you almost <i>expected</i> him not to requite. Your finger seemed to twitch slightly, before you hesitantly pulled away, releasing him. He removed his hand from the opening and, after a moment of thought, turned off the water and got out.</p><p>When you heard the shower cut off, you peered through the hole sadly and found no one in sight.</p><p>~~<br></p><p>You sat awkwardly on the chair at Steve\u2019s desk, constantly adjusting the clothes you\u2019d found laying on the bed when you stepped out of the bathroom. Your heart was racing despite your incessant attempts to calm it and you squirmed in your seat. Steve would return soon, and you dreaded the company he would bring. A talk was in order, a big talk, that you had no chance of opting out of.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep running, you have to face this. You played a hand in getting into this.\u201d You chastised yourself quietly, closing your eyes and adding under your breath, \u201cnot his fault you broke your one rule, Idiot.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, you rubbed your hands over your face roughly. Footsteps sounded down the hall and you tensed, straightening yourself as you prepared to face the unpleasant conversation. The door opened slowly, stopping halfway as someone spoke softly outside then continuing in its tracks as Steve walked in. He blocked the doorway, not fully entering the room as he flashed you a pitying smile.</p><p>\u201cThere are some final things I need to work out before we get moving, I need to go talk to my friends who are helping us and,\u201d Steve paused, glancing behind him quickly before he lowered his voice, \u201cI think you\u2019ve got some things to work out in private.\u201d</p><p>He sidestepped, and your heart stopped as Bucky stepped in, halting in front of Steve when his eyes met yours. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder and leaned in, head turned towards the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn,\u201d he whispered to him, giving him a stern look before patting his shoulder and leaving the two of you alone, shutting the door.</p><p>You both were at a stalemate, the air thick with unspoken words, and neither of you made any moves to speak. His gaze had dropped from yours, lowering to the ground as he shifted on his feet and cleared his throat awkwardly.</p><p>You swallowed, rising from your chair as you willed yourself to speak, and forced, \u201cBucky, I-\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand and you were silent instantly, hanging on the edge of his fingers like they pulled the very strings of your mind. Your mouth went dry and whatever you planned on saying in that moment melted away as you breathed heavily, heart pounding in your ears. His demeanor seemed to morph in phases, shifting from one emotion to another until he settled on conscientious.</p><p>Lowering his hand smoothly, he gestured for you to sit back down, taking careful steps to take his own seat on the edge of the bed. The silence hung heavy in the air but you didn\u2019t dare disturb it. He had complete control over the situation, something unusual for you due to the fact that by nature, you forced yourself into the position of leader, and despite your mind raging in protest, you gave the authority to him unfalteringly. The only sound that filled the room was his steadied breaths and the soft hum of his left arm as he wrung his hands in his lap. His head was bowed but for once, his hair didn\u2019t hide is face fore he had tucked the strands behind his ear as he lowered to the mattress, allowing you to see the intricacies of his expression as he carefully plucked the words from his mind and placed them together before opening his mouth to share the particularly formulated thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be mad at you for backing out of whatever it was that I was trying to start. Yes, before I was. I was honestly pissed and I\u2019m sure you picked that up. I felt like you just ripped my heart out of my chest and I was selfish in the way I acted. I should have realized how stupid it was, how horribly timed it was\u2026I just wanted to believe\u2026I was <i>desperate</i> to believe we were ready for something\u2026that you even <i>wanted</i> something between us. I should never have put words in your mouth or pushed anything on you, and I definitely shouldn\u2019t have said\u2026what I said. Those aren\u2019t words you can just throw at someone, they\u2019re not easy words to digest, they weigh too much to just drop on a person, and it was wrong of me to do that. It wasn\u2019t fair to you. I wasn\u2019t right for me to put that on you,\u201d Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a deep breath before looking you in the eyes with a gentle determination, \u201cRegardless of that, I did mean it. I know to say that kind of defeats the purpose of everything I just told you but I just need to say it. I don\u2019t expect anything back from you, I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m not asking you to give me anything back in return, you don\u2019t owe me anything, I don\u2019t want you to feel pressured to say it back or <i>anything</i>. It was stupid of me to say it but I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Time seemed to slow with every word that fell from his lips and your heart was thundering in your chest. Dizziness overtook you and you shot out your arm to grip the desk beside you. Your head was spinning, thoughts swirling at breakneck speed, grasping aimlessly at the words he\u2019d spoken to you, willing yourself to hold onto them and wrestle them into becoming clear to you.</p><p>Someone loves you and they don\u2019t regret it. Someone who knows very well the dangers that come with attachments to you, the heartbreak, the pain, someone who knows how broken you are no matter how hard you\u2019ve tried to hide it, <i>loves you. </i>Despite it all, they actually love you.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t realized you\u2019d zoned out until two strong hands planted themselves gently on you, one on your knee and the other on your cheek. You looked down, but had to blink a few times to bring his face into view, his eyebrows furrowed and a piece of his hair had fallen from its place behind his ear from the speed in which he had jumped to you.</p><p>His grip on your face was firm, forcing you to keep him in view as he whispered, \u201cHey, breathe. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t realized you were hyperventilating until his words clicked in your mind and you sucked in a deep breath, pulling your head back from his hand. Shaking your head, you brushed your hands roughly over your pants, trying to keep them from twitching.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just\u2026I\u2019m fine. I just\u2026God, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d you stuttered, dropping your head in your hands with an angered groan, \u201cThis is just\u2026Listen, Barnes, I\u2019m not used to being overwhelmed, it\u2019s not normal for me. But I broke my one rule and I\u2019m freaking out. I don\u2019t get emotional and it\u2019s fucking up my brain right now. Your stupid goddamn beautiful face is screwing me up.\u201d</p><p>The muffled words tumbled from your mouth against your will, and the moment your jumbled brain caught up with reality, you gaped. Eyes going wide, you lifted your head to face his mouth opening and closing in shock. Bucky cocked his head, leaning back slightly as he replayed your words, an array of emotions crossing his face. You were close to bolting after what seemed like ages of him just staring at you before you stopped at the twitch of his lips. They began to curl into a hesitant grin, unsteady in their path up his cheeks before solidifying their place, displaying his perfect teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d A soft laugh left him, mingling with the air and his words, the smile now hard-set.</p><p>You wanted to run. God, you just wanted to jump out of that fucking window and never show your face in New York again \u00a0What the hell were you thinking saying something like that? We you some kind of idiot?</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean it\u2026Well i did mean it i-\u201d you stammered and huffed, shoving him as you rushed, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know much about love or feelings or whatever, but I\u2026 I guess I\u2026like you too,\u201d The hesitation in your own voice \u00a0made you cringe and you put your hand up to stop him from moving away as he frowned, \u201cGod that sounded so bad, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t even know how to say this. You\u2019re different to me. I know that much. I..think about you differently, I regard you differently, I interact with you differently. You\u2019re not just some other person to me, I know I feel at least <i>something</i> with you. Even though I\u2019m sure of that, and I\u2019m sorry for this, I don\u2019t think I can say..you know what back, at least not yet. Don\u2019t take that the wrong way, please, I\u2019m just worried about starting something that won\u2019t end well between us. I only have a few rules for myself, but this one is huge, it\u2019s my biggest rule, and I\u2019m shattering it. \u00a0I made those rules to protect myself because I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. My whole life\u2019s been a shit show and..meeting you was the best thing to ever come out of it. I don\u2019t want to lose you too. If I tell you I love you and then I find I can\u2019t keep that up, I\u2019ll never forgive myself for dragging you through that pain. Please understand, James. I do care about you, and you mean a hell of a lot to me, and maybe..maybe I truly do love you, but I\u2019m not ready to say that yet.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things you\u2019ve done in this world, all the missions, escaping, being on the run, and staying alive, you began to wonder if they even compared to this moment right here. This was the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever down in your life: Share pure, personal, honesty. You wondered if the fear was evident on your face, if he could see the stop of your chest as you held your breath, waiting. It felt like your whole existence was riding on this moment, on his response. You supposed, in a way it did, due in part to the fact that if he rejects you, your only support in this would be destroyed and you\u2019d be thrown in a prison and forgotten. It\u2019s funny, how life plays the string of irony, turning the tables on things you thought you knew. You\u2019d only ever had two purposes in life, the line between them somehow vaguely blurred: Protector and executioner. But now, as you sat in your seat, feeling your world crack with each second that ticked by, you were neither one nor the other. Your life and the very strings that held it together were now the targets, and you waited to see which purpose Bucky would fulfill; would he patch these ripping threads back together, or make the final cut to destroy them forever?</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, he finally stirred the stagnant air, leaning back and nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he started, a gentle smile tugging at his lips, \u201cI can work with \u2018maybe.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A warm sensation began to spread through your chest, one you couldn\u2019t place. It was unfamiliar, new, and never before experienced but every single fiber of the feeling was wonderfully indescribable. It felt as if someone had filled every little crack and healed every little imperfection of your scarred heart with a gentle kiss of sunshine. You wondered if it was glowing through your chest, rattling against your bones with an insatiable urge to leap from you and kiss the star that eased its ache. That tired organ deserved as much, so you appeased it\u2019s desire and pressed it close to that perfect sun.</p><p>The action surprised you both, but you made no attempt to stop yourself as you launched from your chair and wrapped your arms firmly around the man in front of you, squeezing like your life depended on it. In a way, it did, so you gripped a little stronger and let out a breath. The warmth grew when his own arms curled around you, his soft chuckle kissing your ear as the cool metal of his fingers carded through your hair, holding you safely against him, pressing your hearts as close as possible. You could have sworn you felt yours reaching for his, as his own beat softly through you, playing with the rhythm of your rejuvenated heart.</p><p>\u201cI owe you everything,\u201d you breathed out, words weaving through the strands of his hair that your face had nuzzled itself into.</p><p>He pressed his face softly into your shoulder, and you weren\u2019t sure if you were imagining things, or if you truly felt his lips place a feather light kiss upon it before he spoke, his voice addictingly gravely, \u201cYes you do. And I know exactly how you can pay me back,\u201d you started to lift your head to look at him but he held you firmly in place as he continued, \u201cLive your life the way you want to, make yourself happy, and don\u2019t let fear stop you from that. Make bold choices, take risks! That\u2019s where the fun is at!\u201d</p><p>You pulled back to look at him and teased, \u201cWell, now you\u2019re just stealing my lines.\u201d</p><p>He let out a laugh, an airy chuckle that floated through the air softly and lightened the atmosphere of the room. It was contagious, and soon a similar sound escaped you as your hands slid down his arms to rest on his hands, squeezing them gently. Your mind drifted from the present- Was this what home felt like? The weight on your shoulders and the burden on your mind seemed bearable now, easier, and for once, letting your walls down didn\u2019t seem so scary. With the man in front of you to stand guard, you were always\u2026safe.</p><p>That was the first time in your life you\u2019d ever really believed that.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get going,\u201d you started reluctantly, not wanting to break the moment, but you knew no more time could be wasted, \u201cRogers is probably ready to go.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, smile still present on his lips as he looked down at your hands clasped together, nodding, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We need to get you out of here before the rest of the team realizes you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>He stood slowly from the ground, looking down with a blissful grin, extending his hand. You took it gratefully, and the both of you collected yourselves to regroup with Steve.</p><p>~~</p><p>Bucky had received a text to meet Steve and the others in the hangar, and after carefully sneaking your way there, the two of you stood in front of a whirring jet, the ramp resting on the ground. Steve stood at the foot of it, alongside Sam Wilson and a young girl you just barely recognized as Wanda Maximoff, who seemed to tense slightly at the sight of you. Keeping your expression neutral and your distance generous, you gave a curt nod of acknowledgment to the group.</p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve greeted, before turning to you and making brief introductions, \u201c(Y/N), this is Sam Wilson, who you\u2019ve met, and Wanda Maximoff, who I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve made each other\u2019s acquaintances. They\u2019re our help on the inside, they\u2019ll do whatever they can to keep the heat off of us and keep the team off our trail.\u201d</p><p>You piled the bricks of your mental walls up quickly, making sure each one was in its own perfect spot before closing the space between you and Steve\u2019s friends, extending your hand in salutation. Wilson reciprocated quickly, a firm but short handshake that was accompanied unexpectedly by a flirtatious smirk and a wink sent in the direction of Bucky behind you. Your eyes narrowed as you pulled your hand back with a bite of irritation and moved on to the girl beside him. Her interaction contrasted greatly with Sam\u2019s, her moves calculated but performed with hesitation, her guard up as high as it could go. You wondered if perhaps her trepidation was not only a result of your reputation but from her extraordinary ability to read minds, leading her to see first hand what was only scrawled into files that barely scratched the surface of the true nature of their horrors. It was better not to worry yourself with things you couldn\u2019t control, so you tucked the thought away and forced a quick smile, ending the handshake and locking your stance back again.</p><p>After the awkward exchange, Steve cut all interactions short, thanking his friends a few more times for the help before ushering you and Bucky onto the jet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to move quickly, before the team finds out you\u2019re gone.\u201d Steve rushed, directing the both of you up the ramp.</p><p>He entered last, sending a wave to his friends who returned the gesture as the ramp lifted to a close.</p><p>The craft was different from the ones you\u2019d seen, bigger in every way. The ramp connected to the side rather than the back, and further towards the end of the jet was a few separate cabins, one you assumed was for sleeping and the like. A very small medical \u201ccenter\u201d was tucked into the corner off the main area, across from the seats and weapons holder. Three stuffed duffel bags sat on the cot, lined up in a row. You raised an eyebrow, barely getting the chance to point at them before Steve started.</p><p>\u201cYou two are trouble,\u201d he scolded, \u201cI\u2019d be insane to send you both off into hiding without me.\u201d</p><p>You smirked slightly at him, a quiet huff leaving you as you walked towards the back of the jet. You wanted to fall into a more carefree feeling, but something felt off and you noticed the distance between the two best friends behind you.</p><p>Bucky seemed to keep space between him and Steve, a lost look on his face that conflicted with the sureness of his posture. Agitation was evident in his body language, clenching fists hung at his sides, shoulders hunched slightly as he breathed with a steady heaviness. The blonde turned to him with a questioning look but was only met with silence as Bucky shook his head to himself and yanked the duffel bag from its place, moving to toss it into the back.</p><p>Confused, you glanced at him, wordlessly asking if he was alright. His eyes met yours, and with an expression of determination, he turned back around to face Steve.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), your bag\u2019s on the left, go pick a cot,\u201d Bucky didn\u2019t so much as side eye you, and the commanding tone of his voice left no room for argument. Silently, you grabbed the bag, excusing yourself quietly from the uncomfortable atmosphere and practically running to the back room, desperate to remove yourself from in between the now growing tension.</p><p>Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a few deep breaths as he shifted on his feet. Steve fought back the urge to ask him questions, finding it the better idea to wait and let the man speak first. Something troubling was obviously on his mind, and out of respect of that, Rogers remained unspeaking, allowing his friend to formulate his words.</p><p>It took a few tries, his mouth opening and closing a few times before he finally started to speak, \u201cI appreciate the help, Steve, I really do, we\u2019d be screwed without it, but I just\u2026 Something is on my mind and I just can\u2019t shake it.\u201d His tone slowly started to grow in anger, a seed of disappointment rooted in the center as he lifted his head to bore his gaze into Steve\u2019s, \u201cYou knew about the plan to arrest her. You were there when it was spelled out\u2026but how fucking long did you know before we got back? Why the hell didn\u2019t you warn me before so I could have avoided it all together? I could have just waited it out. She never would have been shoved in that cage, we could have saved her all that stress. Steve, we..\u201d he paused, breathing fast in exasperation, \u201cWe could have screwed up everything. I could have lost whatever trust she had in me. I never would have gotten that back.\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned, unable to even get a syllable out before Bucky seemed to come to another revelation, a sadness beginning to entwine itself with his vexation, \u201cYou knew I\u2026Y-you knew I loved her. I didn\u2019t have to say it. You knew I <i>loved</i> her, while you sat in that meeting and listened to them plan to cage her like an animal, and you couldn\u2019t even spare me a heads up?\u201d</p><p>The man let out a great sigh, shoulders slumping in defeat as he shook his head, \u201cBucky, I\u2026\u201d words seemed to escape him, a sick feeling rising from the pit of his soul, but he owed his friend a great deal for his mistakes, so he pushed the sounds out of his mouth, \u201cI can\u2019t say anything that will fix this, I know that. I have no explanation for you, I can\u2019t apologize hard enough, or describe how awful I feel. You\u2019re my best friend, and I let you down. I betrayed you. I should have warned you, but I was acting like a total dumbass. I\u2019m sorry, Bucky. But I am going to make it up to you. I swear on my life. Starting right now, whatever you need, whatever <i>she</i> needs, I\u2019m here. I will fight as hard for her as I fought for you and that\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to stay angry, a part of him wanted to scream, call Steve every name in the book, but the pure sincerity in his friend\u2019s aura calmed the feeling. He radiated the very definition of the word earnest and Bucky could no longer hold the man in front of him in contempt. The tension in his body slowly left with every breath that filtered through his lungs, but he kept his head lowered, keeping his face shielded by his hair so he could work through his thoughts by himself. Steve watched with anticipation to see if his words got through to Barnes, and soon felt a wave of relief wash over him when the man nodded, raising his head to look into his eyes with a soft smile of forgiveness.</p><p>Steve stepped forward, pulling him into a firm hug, which Bucky reciprocated tiredly. It dawned on him, the pure exhaustion in the Soldier\u2019s features, and with a final pat on the back, he gestured him towards the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flying, Buck. You two should get some rest.\u201d He nodded towards the closed door behind which you stood, ear pressed to the metal.</p><p>When you heard Bucky agree and his footsteps start towards you, you darted from the door, standing in front of your cot and pretending to rummage through your bag. He stepped through with a heavy sigh, closing the door as he bent over to grab his own bag from the floor and tossing it onto the bed across from yours.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, I just\u2026needed to talk about something.\u201d He flashed you an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d you flashed him a smile in return, but it faltered at the corners of your lips, and you turned your head away from him.</p><p>A frown took over Bucky\u2019s face, and he crossed his arms, leaning against his bed, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>It was a simple question really, so why did you have such a hard time answering it? Those words, those small, unimpressive words weighed heavily on your shoulders and you struggled to find the way to reply.</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it to you?\u201d You started softly, hesitantly turning to face him, \u201cAm\u2026<i>I</i> worth it to you? This is a lot of trouble you and Steve are going through for me and I\u2019m just not sure if I\u2019m worth it. Maybe it would be best for me to just get dropped off somewhere, give me a headstart, and I\u2019ll just go back on the run. It would probably be easiest. I can be gone in seconds, get out of your hair. I\u2019ve already stupidly let myself settle in too much.\u201d</p><p>Your fingers were twitching at your sides, and you clasped your hands in front of you to stop them. You were divided in your own mind, one half of you was sure this was the right decision. The rules you set for yourself and the walls you built were your protection, and keeping them together was the right thing to do, no matter what you sacrificed. But on the other side, you were screaming on the inside, telling yourself to <b><i>just shut up.</i></b> That half of you was aching, reaching out to Bucky and hoping beyond all hope he\u2019d look at you like you were crazy and completely disregard your suggestion. And, as if for once in your life the stars shined above you and fate wished something other than ill upon you, he did exactly that.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he took a bewildered step forward, arms uncrossing as his eyebrow shot up, \u201cAbsolutely not. (Y/N), I know you\u2019re not used to all this but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve gotta run from it. I\u2019m <i>not</i> letting you run from it. Do you really want to go back to that life? Back on the run?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, you stuttered, \u201cN-no I just..I-I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><p>Panic was a strange and unusual sensation, and it took you a few seconds to realize its unique feeling. Your breathing picked up slightly, mouth running dry as you wrung your fingers together. You were going against everything you\u2019d learned over the course of your life, <i>again</i>, and it sent your brain into chaos. If it were a computer, you\u2019re sure it would have short-circuited and exploded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just still conflicted, Bucky. I\u2019m sorry. I hate taking you on this loop but it\u2019s all just so new to me and my nerves are fried. Everything I\u2019ve learned trying to survive all my life is in direct contradiction to everything I\u2019m doing right now and it\u2019s really crossing my wires here. I don\u2019t want to be on the run anymore. I really don\u2019t. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I\u2019m so fucking tired of running. I want\u2026I\u2019ve dreamed of a normal life since I was allowed to let my thoughts wander without getting thrown back into that god awful chair. I know this is my chance. But I never thought I\u2019d get it and now that it\u2019s here I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m not as ready as I thought I\u2019d be to take it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply, gesturing for you to sit. After a moment\u2019s contemplation, you obliged and to your surprise, he moved to sit next to you, plopping down beside you. He took a moment to collect his thoughts before speaking.</p><p>\u201cListen, Doll, I know what you\u2019re going through. I went through the same thing when Steve showed up at my apartment in Bucharest. Again, my whole life got flipped on its head and I had no idea what to do, what decisions to make. At first, even I ran from it. Literally. I didn\u2019t expect it. I was\u2026honestly, I was scared, terrified even, and I almost let that chance of a new life slip away. If I wasn\u2019t stopped, even though it wasn\u2019t in good circumstances, I would have got away and never turned back. I never would have reunited with Steve, never would have recovered, met the team. I would have lost my second chance. I can\u2019t imagine if that happened.\u201d He paused for a moment, nodding to himself as if it would help to push the words out, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you miss your chance. You deserve it more than I can say and I\u2019ll do anything to ensure you get it. I know you\u2019re scared, even though you won\u2019t admit that, but I\u2019m here for you. Hell, Steve is here for you. We\u2019re going to fight for you until the team sees what we see, and then we\u2019re going to help you recover. You\u2019ll get the same programs, opportunities, and resources that I had.\u201d</p><p>You stared at the ground for a moment, processing the words, \u201cBut I don\u2019t\u2026But, James, I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>The speed in which Bucky whipped his head towards you made you jump. His hand came to rest firmly on your leg as he asserted, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that. You do deserve it, completely deserve it. And I know you want it, so take it. Your past doesn\u2019t matter, (Y/N), it wasn\u2019t up to you. HYDRA can suck it, because you\u2019re getting your second chance. No ifs, ands, or buts. Darlin\u2019, you\u2019re a good person, no matter what you think, and I\u2019m going to make sure your future reflects that.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, with the intensity of his electric blue eyes, it seemed impossible to tear your gaze from his. There was an unfamiliar sting behind your eyes and your breath hitched in your throat. An urge overtook you that you couldn\u2019t fight, and you threw yourself on him, wrapping your arms tightly around his neck in an awkward hug. He shifted on the mattress to better the angle as he encased you in his hold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to run anymore.\u201d you whimpered softly into his shoulder, fingers digging a little harder into his shirt, \u201cI want someone to care. I\u2019m tired of being a background character in my own life. I\u2019m tired of always having to hide. I don\u2019t want to be invisible just until someone needs something from me. I just want someone to <i>see me. </i>I just\u2026I just want someone to care. <i> </i>\u201d</p><p>When the fabric of his clothes began to dampen against his skin, he tightened his hold, and couldn\u2019t stop himself from planting a kiss to the side of your head, \u201cI see you, Doll, I see you. And I care about you, so fucking much. You don\u2019t have to be invisible anymore. You\u2019re safe with me. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you know,\u201d you hiccupped, taking a breath, \u201cyou know you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever met who\u2019s been there for me. I\u2019ve never had someone\u2026comfort me before. After that nightmare in Germany\u2026I tried to forget it and pretend it didn\u2019t happen, but that meant something to me. That was the first time in my life someone comforted me, truly comforted me. It changed things for me. It was such a strange feeling but it was\u2026it was an amazing feeling. I felt like someone was seeing <i>me</i> and not the mask I was wearing to hide behind,\u201d you paused, taking in the scent of him in hopes it would give you the courage to get your next words out, \u201cBucky,\u201d he hummed when you stopped again, hand sliding down your back to rest on your hip, \u201cYou make me feel like me again.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened underneath you, and he felt like his heart shot a line out to yours and, for the first time, your heart caught it and held it tightly. He was speechless, a joyous warmth feeling his whole being.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he barely registered your gentle voice before he felt you plant a soft, sweet kiss to his cheek, sliding off his lap and padding gently to the bathroom.</p><p>His skin began turning a deep shade of pink that covered his neck and cheeks and seeped into his bones as he sat lost in a lovesick stupor.</p><p>You stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes, drying the tears that had fallen down your cheeks and just breathed. Looking into the mirror, you nodded to yourself, taking a moment to make peace with the path you were choosing to go down. This choice gives you the greatest opportunity for a good future, you\u2019d regret not making it. Nodding firmly to yourself, you exited the room shyly.</p><p>Bucky was leaning over his bed, rummaging through his duffel bag when you reentered, and he turned to flash you a kind smile. Returning the gesture came almost automatically, and you walked silently over to your own.</p><p>Clearing your throat, your let out a soft laugh and joked, \u201cThis is the part where I make a funny remark and pretend I wasn\u2019t just crying like a little bitch a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>He grinned delicately and sighed in an almost blissed out way, \u201cYou\u2019re not a \u2018little bitch\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping here, I\u2019m trying to be sarcastic and avoidant of my humanity,\u201d you quipped.</p><p>His smile widened with a small laugh. He opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by a yawn that broke free from your lips. You shot your hand up to stifle the noise and Bucky couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was just about to say how tired I was, guess you agree with me.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled with a nod, shoving the duffel off the bed and plopping down on it to take your shoes off.</p><p>The both of you proceeded to get ready to sleep, exchange glances and little giggles back and forth before deciding you were ready to hit the hay.</p><p>Bucky turned off the lights after you had settled under your covers, shuffling around a bit more before laying down in his own bed.</p><p>Silence filled the darkness for a few seconds before he broke it again, \u201cSo, I have a question.\u201d</p><p>You picked yourself up from your bed slightly, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Germany,\u201d he started, and the sound of his rustling sheets filled the air as he turned in your direction, \u201cDo you actually cuddle in your sleep or was that all you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Bucky, you\u2019re insufferable,\u201d you scoffed, rolling your eyes despite his inability to see and plopped back into mattress before teasing sarcastically, \u201cCrawl into my bed in the middle of the night and find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0tempt me, Sugar.\u201d</p><p><b><a href=\"http://orderofthefanfic.tumblr.com/post/180962328283\">Next part</a></b></p>",

Hurt was written across his face as his heart dropped into his stomach.</p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t ever say sorry for doing that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bliss. That was the feeling that filled him to the brim, pure and utter bliss. It flowed through him like a river, replacing his blood with the beauty of your smile. It was his lifeline now, the only thing he\u2019d ever need. It pulled him to lean in again, crashing his lips back into yours with fever, pouring more emotions into it, putting his soul into it like he never had before. His hands gripped your waist tightly, and it was almost as if you could feel his desperation through his fingertips. Fireworks were popping in your brain. You\u2019re flying. You\u2019re on top of the world. You\u2019re complete. You\u2019re in <b>love.</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</i></p><p>Realization, panic, fear. You\u2019re in love. Your heart stopped beating in your chest and you pushed away frantically, breaking the kiss, that beautiful, wonderful kiss. You might have just made the worst decision of your life. You fell in love, with Bucky <i>Fucking</i> Barnes.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I just\u2026I can\u2019t do this. We can\u2019t do this.\u201d You stuttered on the words, breath picking up rapidly.</p><p>You could almost hear his heart shatter, the look on his face created an aching in your chest and for the first time since Manarola, yours shattered too. Even after watching this man be beaten and broken and torn apart and utterly destroyed, you\u2019d never seen a pain as deep seeded and decimating as the kind that shadowed his face in that very moment. His bright, blue eyes seemed to darken as a pit opened in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean you can\u2019t do this?\u201d God his voice felt like someone was cutting the strings of your heart one by one, the tremor and crack and absolute brokenness of the sound filling your veins with a blackness you knew you would never be able to wash away again. \u201cYou kissed me back. You felt it too. I-I know you felt it too.\u201d</p><p>Bucky could feel the sting behind his eyes as his mouth went dry and he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t fucking<i> breathe. </i>His world was cracked right down the middle and it continued to splinter as you stared, unmoving, in front of him. You must have felt it too, he was desperate to hear you admit it. He was desperate to not be the only one. He loved you, and he needed you to love him back. So much so, that the urge forced words from his mouth that burned when they left his lips, ached when they hit the air because they didn\u2019t want to enter a world where you wouldn\u2019t except them.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Time stopped, everything stopped, and in that moment, it was just you and him, the only people in the world. He loved you, and no matter how much you wanted and tried to say it back, the words wouldn\u2019t leave you. A sickeningly dense silence filled the room.</p><p>\u201cB-Bucky I\u2026I-I\u2026\u201d you stuttered, tripping on words as your mind raced. You watched with pain as his eyes began to brim with tears and he took a distressed step forward.</p><p>You were both interrupted by the door opening and Steve Rogers slipped into the room, stopping short as he saw the interaction before him. In a ditch attempt to escape the situation, you flashed him a pleading look and the moment his eyes locked on the tear-stained cheeks of his best friend, he snapped into action. Long strides carried him to Bucky, hands gripping his shoulders as he forced him back.</p><p>Gesturing out with his head, he rushed, \u201cGo to my room, it\u2019s next door, F.R.I.D.A.Y. will let you in. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>Bucky\u2019s eyes were locked on you, red and puffy, and they gave him the expression of a kicked puppy. A whispered shaky apology escaped your lips as you began to rush from the room, stumbling on your own feet.</p><p>\u201cI said I love you. I love you.\u201d he was calling out to you as you fled, choking back sobs as he began to shout, \u201cI love you goddammit, say something! Say something!\u2026P-Please..\u201d</p><p>His yells succeeded in cracking the walls you held up so hopelessly, and once the door to Rogers\u2019s room shut behind you, tears poured down your cheeks as you backed into the wall, sliding down into a heap on the floor and burying your face in your hands.</p><p>~~</p><p>After you had left the room, Bucky slowly started shutting down, forcing his emotions back into his mind, and going completely soundless. Steve had tried to get an explanation out of him, anything to understand what he walked in on, but he quickly discovered he was wasting his time. The man was silent, vacant eyes staring at the wall in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou should go take a shower, clear your head. I\u2019ll go talk to her, work out what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Steve was pulling clothes out of drawers and placing them on the bed, pushing Bucky out of his chair gently and towards the bathroom.</p><p>He didn\u2019t put up much of a protest, grumbling quietly as he shuffled to the bathroom and slammed the door behind him. Steve let out a sigh, gazing at the closed room for a few seconds before he reluctantly headed for his room to speak with you.</p><p>You had picked yourself up from the floor weakly, aggressively rubbing away the tears with a sniffle. Taking the first look around the Captain\u2019s room, you studied it, gathering a brief understanding of the man behind the shield. It was odd, someone who evidently didn\u2019t trust you, allowing you in such a private place without hesitation. It was obviously in the interest of his friend, but something in the way he looked at you felt oddly\u2026comforting, like this invitation to his room was a way of sheltering <i>you</i> and not just the exposed heart of Bucky. It was much more personalized than the soldier\u2019s, pictures littered the walls and the colors were a bit less muted. The style was practical, yet characterized in its own unique way. You walked slowly away from the door, fingers gently grazing the top of his dresser, eyes scanning the photos there. The hitch in your breath when you inhaled forced you to stop, bowing your head as you took calming breaths through your nose. You stood that way for a moment, before rubbing away the remaining tears and making your way to the window. The city was lit up in the darkness of the night, windows illuminated in perfect rows down the length of the many skyscrapers looming on the horizon. The thick glass of the panels blocked out any sounds from the streets, headlights passed by silently, and occasionally the pattern of the lights on the buildings would change. You watched the scene mutely, but inside, your mind was screaming.</p><p>A noise behind you whipped your attention away from the window as Steve cleared his throat behind you. You didn\u2019t hear him come in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I walked into, or what was happening, but we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Those words were never good, not in your experience, and you closed your eyes with a sigh. Alone, for the first time in a long time, you couldn\u2019t help but let the tears fall, but you\u2019d be damned if you let that wall down in front of Steve Rogers. Taking in a deep breath, you straighten your posture, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what there is to talk about, Spangles,\u201d you shot, but your voice faltered as you added, \u201cThat was a private matter, that evidently didn\u2019t go very well.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face, an agitated sigh leaving his lips, \u201cI\u2026you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>It felt like someone switched a breaker in your mind. It sizzled and popped like a TV without a signal. You must have been hearing things because there is no way in the infinite possibilities of universes that America\u2019s Golden Boy, Captain America himself, just agreed with you. Your eyebrow rose to the roof.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, you\u2019re right,\u201d he repeated, nodding his head before he pulled the seat from under the table and motioned for you to sit on the bed, \u201cSo we\u2019ll talk about something else. Cause if I\u2019m going to help you, I need to get to know you. Bucky is convinced you\u2019re not what HYDRA made you, but I need you to prove that to me.\u201d</p><p>You hardened your expression, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat. Your mind flashed back to Bucky, the broken expression that took over his features when you failed to say those three words back. Steve did not hold your trust in the slightest, but he <i>was</i> Bucky\u2019s friend, and after seeing the heartbreak in that man\u2019s eyes that <i>you</i> caused, you\u2019d do anything to fix it, even if that meant opening up to Steve Rogers.</p><p>Letting out a sigh, you slowly sat on the bed, folding your hands on your lap and looking up to meet his eyes, \u201cWhat do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cWhen you first got here, he said he owed you. What for?\u201d Steve was careful with his tone, watching your fingers twitch in your lap as he softened his expression slightly.</p><p><i>It wasn\u2019t exactly a rare occasion to share a cell with the other asset and the both of you had grown quite accustomed to sharing your space. It was a normal night by your standards and you sat on the floor, gazing blankly at the dirty concrete. A shuffle dragged your attention into your surroundings and you looked up to see Winter standing strangely in the middle of the cell, illuminated by the light beam from the barred viewport, hair even more disheveled than usual, hands out in front of him as he seemed entranced by the sight of them, flipping them over and over as his ragged breathing entered your ear. You furrowed your brows, rising slowly from the ground as you cautiously lifted your hands at the ready. He looked up, an uncharacteristic panic in his eyes as he took an aggressive step forward.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not the Winter Soldier.\u201d</i></p><p><i>The words made you freeze, mind clicking as you swallowed thickly. He repeated himself with more force, a determination filling him that you had never seen. It had been a long time since either of you had been wiped and the programming was wearing thinner and thinner. His seemed to have cracked and it spurred a ridge in your own. Everything in your mind was screaming for you to stop what you were doing, but it wasn\u2019t strong enough as you bent down, pushing a broken chunk of concrete out of the way to grab what was hidden behind it. Something was pulling at you, desperately trying to stop you from moving towards him, stop you from doing this because it was a risk you weren\u2019t sure was worth taking. For the first time, you fought against your better judgment, trading survival for sympathy as you stepped towards him. He was hesitant, but the look you gave him locked him in a trance. You reached him, wordlessly asking permission before you took his hands in yours gently, flipping the palms up before placing the object in his grasp. The metal was cold on his skin, the chain dangling between his fingers, and he looked in shock between you and his hands. You covered his hand with your own, looking him in the eye deeply as the dog tags warmed between your fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThese are yours. I found them in the archives. I\u2026kept them. I don\u2019t know why, but I did. They belong to you though. Keep these safe. No matter what happens, no matter what they do to you, you keep these.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2026W-What are they?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey\u2019re you. These are your dog tags. Your name is Bucky. And you\u2019re not the Winter Soldier.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou had his dog tags? How? Why?\u201d There was an expression on Steve\u2019s face you couldn\u2019t quite place. It was mixed between sadness, confusion, and\u2026relief? Happiness? The word to describe it escaped you, and you slid your gaze from his piercing blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI found them in the archives when I was\u2026When I was looking for my own files, which I never found. I don\u2019t know why I kept them, honestly, I don\u2019t,\u201d you cleared your throat, desperate to keep your composure, \u201cand I don\u2019t know why I gave them to him. But he <i>did</i> keep them. Right where I hid them. He still has them, he had them when he was wiped before he fought you on the helicarriers. They kept a piece of him alive and he owed me for that. I\u2019ve already cashed my check and he paid the bill. I don\u2019t want anything else from him.\u201d</p><p>There was a strange feeling in your chest with those last words, as if you were trying to convince the man in front of you wholeheartedly that you didn\u2019t want any more from Bucky Barnes. Why you felt the need to say it was beyond you.</p><p>Steve only nodded, finally breaking the hold his gaze held over you as he looked away with a thick swallow. The gears seemed to be turning in his head, reeling up another question.</p><p>\u201cWhen I broke you out,\u201d his words were slow, the cogs in his head working double time to make the words come out right, before he backtracked in his question, \u201cyou didn\u2019t trust me, I know you <i>don\u2019t</i> trust me, but all it took was for me to say \u2018I\u2019m on Bucky\u2019s side\u2019 to get you to follow me. I know you\u2019re not stupid, I know you know, as well as I do, that I very well could have been lying to you. I could have been making things worse. Why did you give in so easily?\u201d</p><p>You were slightly taken aback by the question, pausing to blink a few times as you breathed in and out, calculating your response carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Steve, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d you held back your own shock at the softness of your tone, Steve had evidently noticed the change because he shifted in his chair, expression easing just the tiniest bit of tension, \u201cI can see how much you matter to Bucky and you\u2019ve shown me <i>many</i> times how much he matters to you. He\u2019s the closest thing I have to an ally right now and I need to take what I can get. I know when I\u2019m had, I know when I\u2019m screwed. If I have to swallow my pride and follow the man who had me arrested,\u201d you added with a bite of irritation, but it faded, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. If Bucky trust you\u2026then I\u2019ll have to trust you, too.\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t respond. His eyes were fixed on your hands, twiddling in your lap as he pushed out a breath.</p><p>He inhaled sharply, adjusting his posture as he stood, nodding and eased, \u201cOkay. That works for me.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrow shot to the roof as you rose with him, \u201cWait, what? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d a soft smile pull at his previous hardened expression, \u201clook, I can see what Bucky sees. There\u2019s more to you than your files, I see that now. I made the wrong call with you, and now I want to make up for that.\u201d</p><p>Silence was all you gave him, eyes boring into his, searching for a hint of deceit as you fought the drop of your jaw. Even when you tried to speak, you stuttered on your words, tripping over every syllable. His hand rose to stop you, shaking his head with a gentle smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get moving. We can\u2019t stay here forever. I\u2019ll get the team to come around but until then it\u2019s best if you\u2019re not here. I\u2019ll get the plan finalized and we\u2019ll all talk about it,\u201d he watched you twitch at the words and he repeated firmly, \u201cWe\u2019ll <i>all</i> talk about it.\u201d</p><p>You merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d his tone changed as he started towards the door, \u201cYou should take some time, freshen up, relax. You can use my shower. I\u2019ll have clothes here for you when you\u2019re done, then we\u2019ll work everything out.\u201d</p><p>You opened your mouth to protest but he stopped you with a pointed look.</p><p>You heard a sigh and dropped your shoulders, waving him off as you moved towards the bathroom and relented, \u201cWhatever, Stars and Stripes.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed quietly with a smile and exited the room, leaving you alone once more in his room. Taking one last glance around the space, you shook your head as you entered the spacious bathroom.</p><p>The water was scalding, but he needed the distraction. His mind was slipping deeper and deeper into the void he struggled to climb out of. God, he was such an idiot, a stupid <i>fucking </i>idiot. The tears wouldn\u2019t stop falling, mixing with the water beads rolling down his face, breathing heavy, nose flaring.</p><p><i>They\u2019d wipe him soon. He knew that, and he couldn\u2019t stop the quell of fear that rose in his chest at the thought. Something was off about the base, it wasn\u2019t just in the confines of his mind, but in the place itself, the atmosphere. Something was changing. That was proven when the cell doors rattled with three commanding knocks.</i></p><p><i>A voice shouted through the thick door gruffly, \u201cTwo minutes, both of you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He stiffened, breathing picking up as the metal arm clicked and whirred. He could hear you shuffling and he perked up at the franticness of the sound. Turning his head, he couldn\u2019t stop the furrow of his brow at your panicked expression. You were sliding on your feet as you scrambled to stand from the cold floor, chest rising and falling in rapid succession. Pacing was how you spent the next minute, agitated pacing as your fingers twitched at your sides. Suddenly, you sprung towards the wall, roughly pushing away a broken chunk of it to grab something. It clinked softly as you pulled it out, the chain dangling wildly, and he took an instinctual step back when you turned to him. The desperate look in your eyes took him by surprise and froze him to the spot. You took long strides to him, hands outstretched to roughly grab his, shoving the dog tags in his palm. He was stiff, fearful eyes darting between you and the necklace as you clutched onto him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you remember these?\u201d You questioned shakily, shaking his hand slightly.</i></p><p><i>He seemed to think hard for a moment before nodding in confusion.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever forget these. Do you understand? Never forget these. You hold onto them with your life. This is you. These are you. Never lose that. No matter what they do to you, no matter what happens, never lose these.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He couldn\u2019t help but nod when the desperate tone of your voice hit his ear, taken aback by the display of emotions he was seeing, one that sharply contrasted with your normal robotic behavior. The moment was broken when the handlers returned, opening the door as they entered, calling to you to come with them. You gave him a look, silently telling him to hide the dog tags clutched in his fingers. One of the men stepped forward impatiently, hand reaching out to pull you away, and he slipped the tags into the pocket of the tattered shorts he wore. Winter moved to step back but was frozen once again when he felt your index wrap around his own. He could feel you quaking, hand shaking violently as you gave him one despaired squeeze, eyes locking with his. You had never been first to grab his finger, never the one to seek comfort first, and even when he was shaken to his core at his impending reunion with that awful machine, he felt stronger when he faced your fear. He squeezed back, confident, consoling, before he let go reluctantly and nodded for you to go where you were called.</i></p><p><i>He never saw you again.</i></p><p>The memory hit him like a truck. He\u2019d tried so hard to push it back, keep it from causing that familiar pain in his chest, but after confessing something to you he never thought he\u2019d have the misleading luxury to have and hearing nothing in return, he couldn\u2019t stop the images from resurfacing. So many emotions swirled around in his head: sorrow, pain, anger, betrayal, and the worst one of all, that persistent goddamn unrestrainable feeling called love. The tears were pouring down his cheeks and he let out an angered growl, the sound mixing with a sob as he brought his metal fist back and sent a punch to the wall\u2026and right through the tiles.</p><p>You almost jumped out of your skin, a yelp escaping you as a shatter filled the shower, pieces of something hitting the tile floor at your feet. Whipping around, your jaw dropped at the sight of something silver being yanked back through the new hole in the shower wall. You swallowed thickly and took a hesitant step forward, narrowing your eyes as you took the chance and peered through the opening.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for you to decipher who it was. His head was bowed, long hair soaked from the water cascading over him, covering his face from your view. His chest was heaving, water slipping down his skin over the curves and ridges of his body, and he supported himself on the wall between you, muscles tensed. Perhaps now was an inappropriate time, seeing that he was obviously upset, but you couldn\u2019t help but get quite breathless at the sight. This man must have been sculpted by the goddamn <i>gods</i> because he sure looked it. Yes, you\u2019d seen him undressed before, privacy being a foreign concept at HYDRA, but this image was <i>very</i> unexpected, and you swallowed thickly, shifting on your feet before clearing your throat awkwardly.</p><p>His head shot up quickly, eyes wide as he stumbled back from the wall, nearly slipping. The curtain of his hair parted, swinging from the weight the water added to it, and you finally got to see his face. God you wish you hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Although the spray of water masked the tears tracking down his cheeks, his eyes told you everything. They were red and puffy, a kind of soul-crushing exhaustion, of the likes in which you had never seen, dimming the usually brilliant blue. Your arms subconsciously moved to cover your chest and you flattened your back to the wall, hiding yourself from his view. You took a deep breath, maintaining as much of your composure as you could.</p><p>\u201cGod fucking dammit..\u201d He muttered to himself bowing his head again with a great sigh.</p><p>There was a pang in your chest, a tug at the strings of your heart as you closed your eyes, a tear you didn\u2019t know you had slipped down your cheek as your lip quivered. <i>Breathe, stay in control.</i> Fat lot of good that did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the words broke through your lips on a feeble sob, hand shooting up to stem the flow before you said anything more.</p><p>Bucky froze at the sound, head rising slowly as his brows knitted together. He took a moment to breathe, replaying the noise over in his mind, processing it. That kiss was such a stupid idea, he knew that. The realization smacked him the moment it did you and it had been weighing on him since, the gravity of his actions pulling him apart from the inside, but there was a sliver of him that was sure it was all worth it. It tugged at him, yanking his head in all directions trying to get him to pull his shit together, suck it up, and own it. He kissed you, and he loved it. He took that risk, and he was going to own up to it. Whatever happens next, he can handle, as long as he\u2019s got you handling it too.</p><p>Aside from his sigh of resignation, he was silent and nodding to himself as a form of encouragement, he lifted his hand, squeezing his hand through the hole in the wall as much as he could and waited.</p><p>Normally, if he was first to extend his hand it was a silent plea for <i>your</i> reassurance, but this time, however, it felt different. Something in the way the air hung in the atmosphere, in the way your chest was tight and your breath was hitching in your throat, was different. You knew now, it was no request for comfort on his side, it was a gift of it\u2026to you.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, you shyly lifted your hand, curling your finger around his and squeezing, desperately, and the tenseness of your finger lingered a bit too long before you relaxed and waited painstakingly to feel it reciprocated.</p><p>A second went by as Bucky debated in his own head if he should just let go, not give it back, show you what it feels like to put your heart out and get nothing back, but he mentally slapped himself for thinking like that and squeezed: Short, firm, and then relaxed.</p><p>He could hear you audible sigh in relief and he frowned at the idea that you almost <i>expected</i> him not to requite. Your finger seemed to twitch slightly, before you hesitantly pulled away, releasing him. He removed his hand from the opening and, after a moment of thought, turned off the water and got out.</p><p>When you heard the shower cut off, you peered through the hole sadly and found no one in sight.</p><p>~~<br></p><p>You sat awkwardly on the chair at Steve\u2019s desk, constantly adjusting the clothes you\u2019d found laying on the bed when you stepped out of the bathroom. Your heart was racing despite your incessant attempts to calm it and you squirmed in your seat. Steve would return soon, and you dreaded the company he would bring. A talk was in order, a big talk, that you had no chance of opting out of.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep running, you have to face this. You played a hand in getting into this.\u201d You chastised yourself quietly, closing your eyes and adding under your breath, \u201cnot his fault you broke your one rule, Idiot.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, you rubbed your hands over your face roughly. Footsteps sounded down the hall and you tensed, straightening yourself as you prepared to face the unpleasant conversation. The door opened slowly, stopping halfway as someone spoke softly outside then continuing in its tracks as Steve walked in. He blocked the doorway, not fully entering the room as he flashed you a pitying smile.</p><p>\u201cThere are some final things I need to work out before we get moving, I need to go talk to my friends who are helping us and,\u201d Steve paused, glancing behind him quickly before he lowered his voice, \u201cI think you\u2019ve got some things to work out in private.\u201d</p><p>He sidestepped, and your heart stopped as Bucky stepped in, halting in front of Steve when his eyes met yours. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder and leaned in, head turned towards the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn,\u201d he whispered to him, giving him a stern look before patting his shoulder and leaving the two of you alone, shutting the door.</p><p>You both were at a stalemate, the air thick with unspoken words, and neither of you made any moves to speak. His gaze had dropped from yours, lowering to the ground as he shifted on his feet and cleared his throat awkwardly.</p><p>You swallowed, rising from your chair as you willed yourself to speak, and forced, \u201cBucky, I-\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand and you were silent instantly, hanging on the edge of his fingers like they pulled the very strings of your mind. Your mouth went dry and whatever you planned on saying in that moment melted away as you breathed heavily, heart pounding in your ears. His demeanor seemed to morph in phases, shifting from one emotion to another until he settled on conscientious.</p><p>Lowering his hand smoothly, he gestured for you to sit back down, taking careful steps to take his own seat on the edge of the bed. The silence hung heavy in the air but you didn\u2019t dare disturb it. He had complete control over the situation, something unusual for you due to the fact that by nature, you forced yourself into the position of leader, and despite your mind raging in protest, you gave the authority to him unfalteringly. The only sound that filled the room was his steadied breaths and the soft hum of his left arm as he wrung his hands in his lap. His head was bowed but for once, his hair didn\u2019t hide is face fore he had tucked the strands behind his ear as he lowered to the mattress, allowing you to see the intricacies of his expression as he carefully plucked the words from his mind and placed them together before opening his mouth to share the particularly formulated thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be mad at you for backing out of whatever it was that I was trying to start. Yes, before I was. I was honestly pissed and I\u2019m sure you picked that up. I felt like you just ripped my heart out of my chest and I was selfish in the way I acted. I should have realized how stupid it was, how horribly timed it was\u2026I just wanted to believe\u2026I was <i>desperate</i> to believe we were ready for something\u2026that you even <i>wanted</i> something between us. I should never have put words in your mouth or pushed anything on you, and I definitely shouldn\u2019t have said\u2026what I said. Those aren\u2019t words you can just throw at someone, they\u2019re not easy words to digest, they weigh too much to just drop on a person, and it was wrong of me to do that. It wasn\u2019t fair to you. I wasn\u2019t right for me to put that on you,\u201d Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a deep breath before looking you in the eyes with a gentle determination, \u201cRegardless of that, I did mean it. I know to say that kind of defeats the purpose of everything I just told you but I just need to say it. I don\u2019t expect anything back from you, I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m not asking you to give me anything back in return, you don\u2019t owe me anything, I don\u2019t want you to feel pressured to say it back or <i>anything</i>. It was stupid of me to say it but I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Time seemed to slow with every word that fell from his lips and your heart was thundering in your chest. Dizziness overtook you and you shot out your arm to grip the desk beside you. Your head was spinning, thoughts swirling at breakneck speed, grasping aimlessly at the words he\u2019d spoken to you, willing yourself to hold onto them and wrestle them into becoming clear to you.</p><p>Someone loves you and they don\u2019t regret it. Someone who knows very well the dangers that come with attachments to you, the heartbreak, the pain, someone who knows how broken you are no matter how hard you\u2019ve tried to hide it, <i>loves you. </i>Despite it all, they actually love you.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t realized you\u2019d zoned out until two strong hands planted themselves gently on you, one on your knee and the other on your cheek. You looked down, but had to blink a few times to bring his face into view, his eyebrows furrowed and a piece of his hair had fallen from its place behind his ear from the speed in which he had jumped to you.</p><p>His grip on your face was firm, forcing you to keep him in view as he whispered, \u201cHey, breathe. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t realized you were hyperventilating until his words clicked in your mind and you sucked in a deep breath, pulling your head back from his hand. Shaking your head, you brushed your hands roughly over your pants, trying to keep them from twitching.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just\u2026I\u2019m fine. I just\u2026God, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d you stuttered, dropping your head in your hands with an angered groan, \u201cThis is just\u2026Listen, Barnes, I\u2019m not used to being overwhelmed, it\u2019s not normal for me. But I broke my one rule and I\u2019m freaking out. I don\u2019t get emotional and it\u2019s fucking up my brain right now. Your stupid goddamn beautiful face is screwing me up.\u201d</p><p>The muffled words tumbled from your mouth against your will, and the moment your jumbled brain caught up with reality, you gaped. Eyes going wide, you lifted your head to face his mouth opening and closing in shock. Bucky cocked his head, leaning back slightly as he replayed your words, an array of emotions crossing his face. You were close to bolting after what seemed like ages of him just staring at you before you stopped at the twitch of his lips. They began to curl into a hesitant grin, unsteady in their path up his cheeks before solidifying their place, displaying his perfect teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d A soft laugh left him, mingling with the air and his words, the smile now hard-set.</p><p>You wanted to run. God, you just wanted to jump out of that fucking window and never show your face in New York again \u00a0What the hell were you thinking saying something like that? We you some kind of idiot?</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean it\u2026Well i did mean it i-\u201d you stammered and huffed, shoving him as you rushed, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know much about love or feelings or whatever, but I\u2026 I guess I\u2026like you too,\u201d The hesitation in your own voice \u00a0made you cringe and you put your hand up to stop him from moving away as he frowned, \u201cGod that sounded so bad, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t even know how to say this. You\u2019re different to me. I know that much. I..think about you differently, I regard you differently, I interact with you differently. You\u2019re not just some other person to me, I know I feel at least <i>something</i> with you. Even though I\u2019m sure of that, and I\u2019m sorry for this, I don\u2019t think I can say..you know what back, at least not yet. Don\u2019t take that the wrong way, please, I\u2019m just worried about starting something that won\u2019t end well between us. I only have a few rules for myself, but this one is huge, it\u2019s my biggest rule, and I\u2019m shattering it. \u00a0I made those rules to protect myself because I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. My whole life\u2019s been a shit show and..meeting you was the best thing to ever come out of it. I don\u2019t want to lose you too. If I tell you I love you and then I find I can\u2019t keep that up, I\u2019ll never forgive myself for dragging you through that pain. Please understand, James. I do care about you, and you mean a hell of a lot to me, and maybe..maybe I truly do love you, but I\u2019m not ready to say that yet.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things you\u2019ve done in this world, all the missions, escaping, being on the run, and staying alive, you began to wonder if they even compared to this moment right here. This was the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever down in your life: Share pure, personal, honesty. You wondered if the fear was evident on your face, if he could see the stop of your chest as you held your breath, waiting. It felt like your whole existence was riding on this moment, on his response. You supposed, in a way it did, due in part to the fact that if he rejects you, your only support in this would be destroyed and you\u2019d be thrown in a prison and forgotten. It\u2019s funny, how life plays the string of irony, turning the tables on things you thought you knew. You\u2019d only ever had two purposes in life, the line between them somehow vaguely blurred: Protector and executioner. But now, as you sat in your seat, feeling your world crack with each second that ticked by, you were neither one nor the other. Your life and the very strings that held it together were now the targets, and you waited to see which purpose Bucky would fulfill; would he patch these ripping threads back together, or make the final cut to destroy them forever?</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, he finally stirred the stagnant air, leaning back and nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he started, a gentle smile tugging at his lips, \u201cI can work with \u2018maybe.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A warm sensation began to spread through your chest, one you couldn\u2019t place. It was unfamiliar, new, and never before experienced but every single fiber of the feeling was wonderfully indescribable. It felt as if someone had filled every little crack and healed every little imperfection of your scarred heart with a gentle kiss of sunshine. You wondered if it was glowing through your chest, rattling against your bones with an insatiable urge to leap from you and kiss the star that eased its ache. That tired organ deserved as much, so you appeased it\u2019s desire and pressed it close to that perfect sun.</p><p>The action surprised you both, but you made no attempt to stop yourself as you launched from your chair and wrapped your arms firmly around the man in front of you, squeezing like your life depended on it. In a way, it did, so you gripped a little stronger and let out a breath. The warmth grew when his own arms curled around you, his soft chuckle kissing your ear as the cool metal of his fingers carded through your hair, holding you safely against him, pressing your hearts as close as possible. You could have sworn you felt yours reaching for his, as his own beat softly through you, playing with the rhythm of your rejuvenated heart.</p><p>\u201cI owe you everything,\u201d you breathed out, words weaving through the strands of his hair that your face had nuzzled itself into.</p><p>He pressed his face softly into your shoulder, and you weren\u2019t sure if you were imagining things, or if you truly felt his lips place a feather light kiss upon it before he spoke, his voice addictingly gravely, \u201cYes you do. And I know exactly how you can pay me back,\u201d you started to lift your head to look at him but he held you firmly in place as he continued, \u201cLive your life the way you want to, make yourself happy, and don\u2019t let fear stop you from that. Make bold choices, take risks! That\u2019s where the fun is at!\u201d</p><p>You pulled back to look at him and teased, \u201cWell, now you\u2019re just stealing my lines.\u201d</p><p>He let out a laugh, an airy chuckle that floated through the air softly and lightened the atmosphere of the room. It was contagious, and soon a similar sound escaped you as your hands slid down his arms to rest on his hands, squeezing them gently. Your mind drifted from the present- Was this what home felt like? The weight on your shoulders and the burden on your mind seemed bearable now, easier, and for once, letting your walls down didn\u2019t seem so scary. With the man in front of you to stand guard, you were always\u2026safe.</p><p>That was the first time in your life you\u2019d ever really believed that.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get going,\u201d you started reluctantly, not wanting to break the moment, but you knew no more time could be wasted, \u201cRogers is probably ready to go.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, smile still present on his lips as he looked down at your hands clasped together, nodding, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We need to get you out of here before the rest of the team realizes you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>He stood slowly from the ground, looking down with a blissful grin, extending his hand. You took it gratefully, and the both of you collected yourselves to regroup with Steve.</p><p>~~</p><p>Bucky had received a text to meet Steve and the others in the hangar, and after carefully sneaking your way there, the two of you stood in front of a whirring jet, the ramp resting on the ground. Steve stood at the foot of it, alongside Sam Wilson and a young girl you just barely recognized as Wanda Maximoff, who seemed to tense slightly at the sight of you. Keeping your expression neutral and your distance generous, you gave a curt nod of acknowledgment to the group.</p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve greeted, before turning to you and making brief introductions, \u201c(Y/N), this is Sam Wilson, who you\u2019ve met, and Wanda Maximoff, who I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve made each other\u2019s acquaintances. They\u2019re our help on the inside, they\u2019ll do whatever they can to keep the heat off of us and keep the team off our trail.\u201d</p><p>You piled the bricks of your mental walls up quickly, making sure each one was in its own perfect spot before closing the space between you and Steve\u2019s friends, extending your hand in salutation. Wilson reciprocated quickly, a firm but short handshake that was accompanied unexpectedly by a flirtatious smirk and a wink sent in the direction of Bucky behind you. Your eyes narrowed as you pulled your hand back with a bite of irritation and moved on to the girl beside him. Her interaction contrasted greatly with Sam\u2019s, her moves calculated but performed with hesitation, her guard up as high as it could go. You wondered if perhaps her trepidation was not only a result of your reputation but from her extraordinary ability to read minds, leading her to see first hand what was only scrawled into files that barely scratched the surface of the true nature of their horrors. It was better not to worry yourself with things you couldn\u2019t control, so you tucked the thought away and forced a quick smile, ending the handshake and locking your stance back again.</p><p>After the awkward exchange, Steve cut all interactions short, thanking his friends a few more times for the help before ushering you and Bucky onto the jet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to move quickly, before the team finds out you\u2019re gone.\u201d Steve rushed, directing the both of you up the ramp.</p><p>He entered last, sending a wave to his friends who returned the gesture as the ramp lifted to a close.</p><p>The craft was different from the ones you\u2019d seen, bigger in every way. The ramp connected to the side rather than the back, and further towards the end of the jet was a few separate cabins, one you assumed was for sleeping and the like. A very small medical \u201ccenter\u201d was tucked into the corner off the main area, across from the seats and weapons holder. Three stuffed duffel bags sat on the cot, lined up in a row. You raised an eyebrow, barely getting the chance to point at them before Steve started.</p><p>\u201cYou two are trouble,\u201d he scolded, \u201cI\u2019d be insane to send you both off into hiding without me.\u201d</p><p>You smirked slightly at him, a quiet huff leaving you as you walked towards the back of the jet. You wanted to fall into a more carefree feeling, but something felt off and you noticed the distance between the two best friends behind you.</p><p>Bucky seemed to keep space between him and Steve, a lost look on his face that conflicted with the sureness of his posture. Agitation was evident in his body language, clenching fists hung at his sides, shoulders hunched slightly as he breathed with a steady heaviness. The blonde turned to him with a questioning look but was only met with silence as Bucky shook his head to himself and yanked the duffel bag from its place, moving to toss it into the back.</p><p>Confused, you glanced at him, wordlessly asking if he was alright. His eyes met yours, and with an expression of determination, he turned back around to face Steve.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), your bag\u2019s on the left, go pick a cot,\u201d Bucky didn\u2019t so much as side eye you, and the commanding tone of his voice left no room for argument. Silently, you grabbed the bag, excusing yourself quietly from the uncomfortable atmosphere and practically running to the back room, desperate to remove yourself from in between the now growing tension.</p><p>Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a few deep breaths as he shifted on his feet. Steve fought back the urge to ask him questions, finding it the better idea to wait and let the man speak first. Something troubling was obviously on his mind, and out of respect of that, Rogers remained unspeaking, allowing his friend to formulate his words.</p><p>It took a few tries, his mouth opening and closing a few times before he finally started to speak, \u201cI appreciate the help, Steve, I really do, we\u2019d be screwed without it, but I just\u2026 Something is on my mind and I just can\u2019t shake it.\u201d His tone slowly started to grow in anger, a seed of disappointment rooted in the center as he lifted his head to bore his gaze into Steve\u2019s, \u201cYou knew about the plan to arrest her. You were there when it was spelled out\u2026but how fucking long did you know before we got back? Why the hell didn\u2019t you warn me before so I could have avoided it all together? I could have just waited it out. She never would have been shoved in that cage, we could have saved her all that stress. Steve, we..\u201d he paused, breathing fast in exasperation, \u201cWe could have screwed up everything. I could have lost whatever trust she had in me. I never would have gotten that back.\u201d</p><p>Steve frowned, unable to even get a syllable out before Bucky seemed to come to another revelation, a sadness beginning to entwine itself with his vexation, \u201cYou knew I\u2026Y-you knew I loved her. I didn\u2019t have to say it. You knew I <i>loved</i> her, while you sat in that meeting and listened to them plan to cage her like an animal, and you couldn\u2019t even spare me a heads up?\u201d</p><p>The man let out a great sigh, shoulders slumping in defeat as he shook his head, \u201cBucky, I\u2026\u201d words seemed to escape him, a sick feeling rising from the pit of his soul, but he owed his friend a great deal for his mistakes, so he pushed the sounds out of his mouth, \u201cI can\u2019t say anything that will fix this, I know that. I have no explanation for you, I can\u2019t apologize hard enough, or describe how awful I feel. You\u2019re my best friend, and I let you down. I betrayed you. I should have warned you, but I was acting like a total dumbass. I\u2019m sorry, Bucky. But I am going to make it up to you. I swear on my life. Starting right now, whatever you need, whatever <i>she</i> needs, I\u2019m here. I will fight as hard for her as I fought for you and that\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to stay angry, a part of him wanted to scream, call Steve every name in the book, but the pure sincerity in his friend\u2019s aura calmed the feeling. He radiated the very definition of the word earnest and Bucky could no longer hold the man in front of him in contempt. The tension in his body slowly left with every breath that filtered through his lungs, but he kept his head lowered, keeping his face shielded by his hair so he could work through his thoughts by himself. Steve watched with anticipation to see if his words got through to Barnes, and soon felt a wave of relief wash over him when the man nodded, raising his head to look into his eyes with a soft smile of forgiveness.</p><p>Steve stepped forward, pulling him into a firm hug, which Bucky reciprocated tiredly. It dawned on him, the pure exhaustion in the Soldier\u2019s features, and with a final pat on the back, he gestured him towards the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flying, Buck. You two should get some rest.\u201d He nodded towards the closed door behind which you stood, ear pressed to the metal.</p><p>When you heard Bucky agree and his footsteps start towards you, you darted from the door, standing in front of your cot and pretending to rummage through your bag. He stepped through with a heavy sigh, closing the door as he bent over to grab his own bag from the floor and tossing it onto the bed across from yours.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, I just\u2026needed to talk about something.\u201d He flashed you an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d you flashed him a smile in return, but it faltered at the corners of your lips, and you turned your head away from him.</p><p>A frown took over Bucky\u2019s face, and he crossed his arms, leaning against his bed, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>It was a simple question really, so why did you have such a hard time answering it? Those words, those small, unimpressive words weighed heavily on your shoulders and you struggled to find the way to reply.</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it to you?\u201d You started softly, hesitantly turning to face him, \u201cAm\u2026<i>I</i> worth it to you? This is a lot of trouble you and Steve are going through for me and I\u2019m just not sure if I\u2019m worth it. Maybe it would be best for me to just get dropped off somewhere, give me a headstart, and I\u2019ll just go back on the run. It would probably be easiest. I can be gone in seconds, get out of your hair. I\u2019ve already stupidly let myself settle in too much.\u201d</p><p>Your fingers were twitching at your sides, and you clasped your hands in front of you to stop them. You were divided in your own mind, one half of you was sure this was the right decision. The rules you set for yourself and the walls you built were your protection, and keeping them together was the right thing to do, no matter what you sacrificed. But on the other side, you were screaming on the inside, telling yourself to <b><i>just shut up.</i></b> That half of you was aching, reaching out to Bucky and hoping beyond all hope he\u2019d look at you like you were crazy and completely disregard your suggestion. And, as if for once in your life the stars shined above you and fate wished something other than ill upon you, he did exactly that.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he took a bewildered step forward, arms uncrossing as his eyebrow shot up, \u201cAbsolutely not. (Y/N), I know you\u2019re not used to all this but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve gotta run from it. I\u2019m <i>not</i> letting you run from it. Do you really want to go back to that life? Back on the run?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, you stuttered, \u201cN-no I just..I-I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d</p><p>Panic was a strange and unusual sensation, and it took you a few seconds to realize its unique feeling. Your breathing picked up slightly, mouth running dry as you wrung your fingers together. You were going against everything you\u2019d learned over the course of your life, <i>again</i>, and it sent your brain into chaos. If it were a computer, you\u2019re sure it would have short-circuited and exploded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just still conflicted, Bucky. I\u2019m sorry. I hate taking you on this loop but it\u2019s all just so new to me and my nerves are fried. Everything I\u2019ve learned trying to survive all my life is in direct contradiction to everything I\u2019m doing right now and it\u2019s really crossing my wires here. I don\u2019t want to be on the run anymore. I really don\u2019t. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I\u2019m so fucking tired of running. I want\u2026I\u2019ve dreamed of a normal life since I was allowed to let my thoughts wander without getting thrown back into that god awful chair. I know this is my chance. But I never thought I\u2019d get it and now that it\u2019s here I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m not as ready as I thought I\u2019d be to take it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply, gesturing for you to sit. After a moment\u2019s contemplation, you obliged and to your surprise, he moved to sit next to you, plopping down beside you. He took a moment to collect his thoughts before speaking.</p><p>\u201cListen, Doll, I know what you\u2019re going through. I went through the same thing when Steve showed up at my apartment in Bucharest. Again, my whole life got flipped on its head and I had no idea what to do, what decisions to make. At first, even I ran from it. Literally. I didn\u2019t expect it. I was\u2026honestly, I was scared, terrified even, and I almost let that chance of a new life slip away. If I wasn\u2019t stopped, even though it wasn\u2019t in good circumstances, I would have got away and never turned back. I never would have reunited with Steve, never would have recovered, met the team. I would have lost my second chance. I can\u2019t imagine if that happened.\u201d He paused for a moment, nodding to himself as if it would help to push the words out, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you miss your chance. You deserve it more than I can say and I\u2019ll do anything to ensure you get it. I know you\u2019re scared, even though you won\u2019t admit that, but I\u2019m here for you. Hell, Steve is here for you. We\u2019re going to fight for you until the team sees what we see, and then we\u2019re going to help you recover. You\u2019ll get the same programs, opportunities, and resources that I had.\u201d</p><p>You stared at the ground for a moment, processing the words, \u201cBut I don\u2019t\u2026But, James, I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>The speed in which Bucky whipped his head towards you made you jump. His hand came to rest firmly on your leg as he asserted, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that. You do deserve it, completely deserve it. And I know you want it, so take it. Your past doesn\u2019t matter, (Y/N), it wasn\u2019t up to you. HYDRA can suck it, because you\u2019re getting your second chance. No ifs, ands, or buts. Darlin\u2019, you\u2019re a good person, no matter what you think, and I\u2019m going to make sure your future reflects that.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, with the intensity of his electric blue eyes, it seemed impossible to tear your gaze from his. There was an unfamiliar sting behind your eyes and your breath hitched in your throat. An urge overtook you that you couldn\u2019t fight, and you threw yourself on him, wrapping your arms tightly around his neck in an awkward hug. He shifted on the mattress to better the angle as he encased you in his hold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to run anymore.\u201d you whimpered softly into his shoulder, fingers digging a little harder into his shirt, \u201cI want someone to care. I\u2019m tired of being a background character in my own life. I\u2019m tired of always having to hide. I don\u2019t want to be invisible just until someone needs something from me. I just want someone to <i>see me. </i>I just\u2026I just want someone to care. <i> </i>\u201d</p><p>When the fabric of his clothes began to dampen against his skin, he tightened his hold, and couldn\u2019t stop himself from planting a kiss to the side of your head, \u201cI see you, Doll, I see you. And I care about you, so fucking much. You don\u2019t have to be invisible anymore. You\u2019re safe with me. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you know,\u201d you hiccupped, taking a breath, \u201cyou know you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever met who\u2019s been there for me. I\u2019ve never had someone\u2026comfort me before. After that nightmare in Germany\u2026I tried to forget it and pretend it didn\u2019t happen, but that meant something to me. That was the first time in my life someone comforted me, truly comforted me. It changed things for me. It was such a strange feeling but it was\u2026it was an amazing feeling. I felt like someone was seeing <i>me</i> and not the mask I was wearing to hide behind,\u201d you paused, taking in the scent of him in hopes it would give you the courage to get your next words out, \u201cBucky,\u201d he hummed when you stopped again, hand sliding down your back to rest on your hip, \u201cYou make me feel like me again.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened underneath you, and he felt like his heart shot a line out to yours and, for the first time, your heart caught it and held it tightly. He was speechless, a joyous warmth feeling his whole being.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he barely registered your gentle voice before he felt you plant a soft, sweet kiss to his cheek, sliding off his lap and padding gently to the bathroom.</p><p>His skin began turning a deep shade of pink that covered his neck and cheeks and seeped into his bones as he sat lost in a lovesick stupor.</p><p>You stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes, drying the tears that had fallen down your cheeks and just breathed. Looking into the mirror, you nodded to yourself, taking a moment to make peace with the path you were choosing to go down. This choice gives you the greatest opportunity for a good future, you\u2019d regret not making it. Nodding firmly to yourself, you exited the room shyly.</p><p>Bucky was leaning over his bed, rummaging through his duffel bag when you reentered, and he turned to flash you a kind smile. Returning the gesture came almost automatically, and you walked silently over to your own.</p><p>Clearing your throat, your let out a soft laugh and joked, \u201cThis is the part where I make a funny remark and pretend I wasn\u2019t just crying like a little bitch a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>He grinned delicately and sighed in an almost blissed out way, \u201cYou\u2019re not a \u2018little bitch\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping here, I\u2019m trying to be sarcastic and avoidant of my humanity,\u201d you quipped.</p><p>His smile widened with a small laugh. He opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by a yawn that broke free from your lips. You shot your hand up to stifle the noise and Bucky couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was just about to say how tired I was, guess you agree with me.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled with a nod, shoving the duffel off the bed and plopping down on it to take your shoes off.</p><p>The both of you proceeded to get ready to sleep, exchange glances and little giggles back and forth before deciding you were ready to hit the hay.</p><p>Bucky turned off the lights after you had settled under your covers, shuffling around a bit more before laying down in his own bed.</p><p>Silence filled the darkness for a few seconds before he broke it again, \u201cSo, I have a question.\u201d</p><p>You picked yourself up from your bed slightly, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Germany,\u201d he started, and the sound of his rustling sheets filled the air as he turned in your direction, \u201cDo you actually cuddle in your sleep or was that all you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Bucky, you\u2019re insufferable,\u201d you scoffed, rolling your eyes despite his inability to see and plopped back into mattress before teasing sarcastically, \u201cCrawl into my bed in the middle of the night and find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0tempt me, Sugar.\u201d</p><p><b><a href=\"http://orderofthefanfic.tumblr.com/post/180962328283\">Next part</a></b></p>",

Hurt was written across his face as his heart dropped into his stomach.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever say sorry for doing that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bliss. That was the feeling that filled him to the brim, pure and utter bliss. It flowed through him like a river, replacing his blood with the beauty of your smile. It was his lifeline now, the only thing he&rsquo;d ever need. It pulled him to lean in again, crashing his lips back into yours with fever, pouring more emotions into it, putting his soul into it like he never had before. His hands gripped your waist tightly, and it was almost as if you could feel his desperation through his fingertips. Fireworks were popping in your brain. You&rsquo;re flying. You&rsquo;re on top of the world. You&rsquo;re complete. You&rsquo;re in <b>love.</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Realization, panic, fear. You&rsquo;re in love. Your heart stopped beating in your chest and you pushed away frantically, breaking the kiss, that beautiful, wonderful kiss. You might have just made the worst decision of your life. You fell in love, with Bucky <i>Fucking</i> Barnes.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry I just&hellip;I can&rsquo;t do this. We can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; You stuttered on the words, breath picking up rapidly.</p><p>You could almost hear his heart shatter, the look on his face created an aching in your chest and for the first time since Manarola, yours shattered too. Even after watching this man be beaten and broken and torn apart and utterly destroyed, you&rsquo;d never seen a pain as deep seeded and decimating as the kind that shadowed his face in that very moment. His bright, blue eyes seemed to darken as a pit opened in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck do you mean you can&rsquo;t do this?&rdquo; God his voice felt like someone was cutting the strings of your heart one by one, the tremor and crack and absolute brokenness of the sound filling your veins with a blackness you knew you would never be able to wash away again. &ldquo;You kissed me back. You felt it too. I-I know you felt it too.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky could feel the sting behind his eyes as his mouth went dry and he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. He couldn&rsquo;t fucking<i> breathe. </i>His world was cracked right down the middle and it continued to splinter as you stared, unmoving, in front of him. You must have felt it too, he was desperate to hear you admit it. He was desperate to not be the only one. He loved you, and he needed you to love him back. So much so, that the urge forced words from his mouth that burned when they left his lips, ached when they hit the air because they didn&rsquo;t want to enter a world where you wouldn&rsquo;t except them.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Time stopped, everything stopped, and in that moment, it was just you and him, the only people in the world. He loved you, and no matter how much you wanted and tried to say it back, the words wouldn&rsquo;t leave you. A sickeningly dense silence filled the room.</p><p>&ldquo;B-Bucky I&hellip;I-I&hellip;&rdquo; you stuttered, tripping on words as your mind raced. You watched with pain as his eyes began to brim with tears and he took a distressed step forward.</p><p>You were both interrupted by the door opening and Steve Rogers slipped into the room, stopping short as he saw the interaction before him. In a ditch attempt to escape the situation, you flashed him a pleading look and the moment his eyes locked on the tear-stained cheeks of his best friend, he snapped into action. Long strides carried him to Bucky, hands gripping his shoulders as he forced him back.</p><p>Gesturing out with his head, he rushed, &ldquo;Go to my room, it&rsquo;s next door, F.R.I.D.A.Y. will let you in. We&rsquo;ll talk later.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s eyes were locked on you, red and puffy, and they gave him the expression of a kicked puppy. A whispered shaky apology escaped your lips as you began to rush from the room, stumbling on your own feet.</p><p>&ldquo;I said I love you. I love you.&rdquo; he was calling out to you as you fled, choking back sobs as he began to shout, &ldquo;I love you goddammit, say something! Say something!&hellip;P-Please..&rdquo;</p><p>His yells succeeded in cracking the walls you held up so hopelessly, and once the door to Rogers&rsquo;s room shut behind you, tears poured down your cheeks as you backed into the wall, sliding down into a heap on the floor and burying your face in your hands.</p><p>~~</p><p>After you had left the room, Bucky slowly started shutting down, forcing his emotions back into his mind, and going completely soundless. Steve had tried to get an explanation out of him, anything to understand what he walked in on, but he quickly discovered he was wasting his time. The man was silent, vacant eyes staring at the wall in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;You should go take a shower, clear your head. I&rsquo;ll go talk to her, work out what we&rsquo;re going to do,&rdquo; Steve was pulling clothes out of drawers and placing them on the bed, pushing Bucky out of his chair gently and towards the bathroom.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t put up much of a protest, grumbling quietly as he shuffled to the bathroom and slammed the door behind him. Steve let out a sigh, gazing at the closed room for a few seconds before he reluctantly headed for his room to speak with you.</p><p>You had picked yourself up from the floor weakly, aggressively rubbing away the tears with a sniffle. Taking the first look around the Captain&rsquo;s room, you studied it, gathering a brief understanding of the man behind the shield. It was odd, someone who evidently didn&rsquo;t trust you, allowing you in such a private place without hesitation. It was obviously in the interest of his friend, but something in the way he looked at you felt oddly&hellip;comforting, like this invitation to his room was a way of sheltering <i>you</i> and not just the exposed heart of Bucky. It was much more personalized than the soldier&rsquo;s, pictures littered the walls and the colors were a bit less muted. The style was practical, yet characterized in its own unique way. You walked slowly away from the door, fingers gently grazing the top of his dresser, eyes scanning the photos there. The hitch in your breath when you inhaled forced you to stop, bowing your head as you took calming breaths through your nose. You stood that way for a moment, before rubbing away the remaining tears and making your way to the window. The city was lit up in the darkness of the night, windows illuminated in perfect rows down the length of the many skyscrapers looming on the horizon. The thick glass of the panels blocked out any sounds from the streets, headlights passed by silently, and occasionally the pattern of the lights on the buildings would change. You watched the scene mutely, but inside, your mind was screaming.</p><p>A noise behind you whipped your attention away from the window as Steve cleared his throat behind you. You didn&rsquo;t hear him come in.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I walked into, or what was happening, but we need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words were never good, not in your experience, and you closed your eyes with a sigh. Alone, for the first time in a long time, you couldn&rsquo;t help but let the tears fall, but you&rsquo;d be damned if you let that wall down in front of Steve Rogers. Taking in a deep breath, you straighten your posture, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what there is to talk about, Spangles,&rdquo; you shot, but your voice faltered as you added, &ldquo;That was a private matter, that evidently didn&rsquo;t go very well.&rdquo;</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face, an agitated sigh leaving his lips, &ldquo;I&hellip;you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p><p>It felt like someone switched a breaker in your mind. It sizzled and popped like a TV without a signal. You must have been hearing things because there is no way in the infinite possibilities of universes that America&rsquo;s Golden Boy, Captain America himself, just agreed with you. Your eyebrow rose to the roof.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he repeated, nodding his head before he pulled the seat from under the table and motioned for you to sit on the bed, &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll talk about something else. Cause if I&rsquo;m going to help you, I need to get to know you. Bucky is convinced you&rsquo;re not what HYDRA made you, but I need you to prove that to me.&rdquo;</p><p>You hardened your expression, pushing your shoulders back as you cleared your throat. Your mind flashed back to Bucky, the broken expression that took over his features when you failed to say those three words back. Steve did not hold your trust in the slightest, but he <i>was</i> Bucky&rsquo;s friend, and after seeing the heartbreak in that man&rsquo;s eyes that <i>you</i> caused, you&rsquo;d do anything to fix it, even if that meant opening up to Steve Rogers.</p><p>Letting out a sigh, you slowly sat on the bed, folding your hands on your lap and looking up to meet his eyes, &ldquo;What do you need to know?&rdquo;</p><p>~~</p><p>&ldquo;When you first got here, he said he owed you. What for?&rdquo; Steve was careful with his tone, watching your fingers twitch in your lap as he softened his expression slightly.</p><p><i>It wasn&rsquo;t exactly a rare occasion to share a cell with the other asset and the both of you had grown quite accustomed to sharing your space. It was a normal night by your standards and you sat on the floor, gazing blankly at the dirty concrete. A shuffle dragged your attention into your surroundings and you looked up to see Winter standing strangely in the middle of the cell, illuminated by the light beam from the barred viewport, hair even more disheveled than usual, hands out in front of him as he seemed entranced by the sight of them, flipping them over and over as his ragged breathing entered your ear. You furrowed your brows, rising slowly from the ground as you cautiously lifted your hands at the ready. He looked up, an uncharacteristic panic in his eyes as he took an aggressive step forward.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the Winter Soldier.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The words made you freeze, mind clicking as you swallowed thickly. He repeated himself with more force, a determination filling him that you had never seen. It had been a long time since either of you had been wiped and the programming was wearing thinner and thinner. His seemed to have cracked and it spurred a ridge in your own. Everything in your mind was screaming for you to stop what you were doing, but it wasn&rsquo;t strong enough as you bent down, pushing a broken chunk of concrete out of the way to grab what was hidden behind it. Something was pulling at you, desperately trying to stop you from moving towards him, stop you from doing this because it was a risk you weren&rsquo;t sure was worth taking. For the first time, you fought against your better judgment, trading survival for sympathy as you stepped towards him. He was hesitant, but the look you gave him locked him in a trance. You reached him, wordlessly asking permission before you took his hands in yours gently, flipping the palms up before placing the object in his grasp. The metal was cold on his skin, the chain dangling between his fingers, and he looked in shock between you and his hands. You covered his hand with your own, looking him in the eye deeply as the dog tags warmed between your fingers.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;These are yours. I found them in the archives. I&hellip;kept them. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I did. They belong to you though. Keep these safe. No matter what happens, no matter what they do to you, you keep these.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&hellip;W-What are they?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re you. These are your dog tags. Your name is Bucky. And you&rsquo;re not the Winter Soldier.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You had his dog tags? How? Why?&rdquo; There was an expression on Steve&rsquo;s face you couldn&rsquo;t quite place. It was mixed between sadness, confusion, and&hellip;relief? Happiness? The word to describe it escaped you, and you slid your gaze from his piercing blue eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I found them in the archives when I was&hellip;When I was looking for my own files, which I never found. I don&rsquo;t know why I kept them, honestly, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you cleared your throat, desperate to keep your composure, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know why I gave them to him. But he <i>did</i> keep them. Right where I hid them. He still has them, he had them when he was wiped before he fought you on the helicarriers. They kept a piece of him alive and he owed me for that. I&rsquo;ve already cashed my check and he paid the bill. I don&rsquo;t want anything else from him.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a strange feeling in your chest with those last words, as if you were trying to convince the man in front of you wholeheartedly that you didn&rsquo;t want any more from Bucky Barnes. Why you felt the need to say it was beyond you.</p><p>Steve only nodded, finally breaking the hold his gaze held over you as he looked away with a thick swallow. The gears seemed to be turning in his head, reeling up another question.</p><p>&ldquo;When I broke you out,&rdquo; his words were slow, the cogs in his head working double time to make the words come out right, before he backtracked in his question, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t trust me, I know you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> trust me, but all it took was for me to say &lsquo;I&rsquo;m on Bucky&rsquo;s side&rsquo; to get you to follow me. I know you&rsquo;re not stupid, I know you know, as well as I do, that I very well could have been lying to you. I could have been making things worse. Why did you give in so easily?&rdquo;</p><p>You were slightly taken aback by the question, pausing to blink a few times as you breathed in and out, calculating your response carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Steve, I&rsquo;m not stupid,&rdquo; you held back your own shock at the softness of your tone, Steve had evidently noticed the change because he shifted in his chair, expression easing just the tiniest bit of tension, &ldquo;I can see how much you matter to Bucky and you&rsquo;ve shown me <i>many</i> times how much he matters to you. He&rsquo;s the closest thing I have to an ally right now and I need to take what I can get. I know when I&rsquo;m had, I know when I&rsquo;m screwed. If I have to swallow my pride and follow the man who had me arrested,&rdquo; you added with a bite of irritation, but it faded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. If Bucky trust you&hellip;then I&rsquo;ll have to trust you, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve didn&rsquo;t respond. His eyes were fixed on your hands, twiddling in your lap as he pushed out a breath.</p><p>He inhaled sharply, adjusting his posture as he stood, nodding and eased, &ldquo;Okay. That works for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyebrow shot to the roof as you rose with him, &ldquo;Wait, what? Just like that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just like that,&rdquo; a soft smile pull at his previous hardened expression, &ldquo;look, I can see what Bucky sees. There&rsquo;s more to you than your files, I see that now. I made the wrong call with you, and now I want to make up for that.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence was all you gave him, eyes boring into his, searching for a hint of deceit as you fought the drop of your jaw. Even when you tried to speak, you stuttered on your words, tripping over every syllable. His hand rose to stop you, shaking his head with a gentle smile.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to get moving. We can&rsquo;t stay here forever. I&rsquo;ll get the team to come around but until then it&rsquo;s best if you&rsquo;re not here. I&rsquo;ll get the plan finalized and we&rsquo;ll all talk about it,&rdquo; he watched you twitch at the words and he repeated firmly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll <i>all</i> talk about it.&rdquo;</p><p>You merely nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; his tone changed as he started towards the door, &ldquo;You should take some time, freshen up, relax. You can use my shower. I&rsquo;ll have clothes here for you when you&rsquo;re done, then we&rsquo;ll work everything out.&rdquo;</p><p>You opened your mouth to protest but he stopped you with a pointed look.</p><p>You heard a sigh and dropped your shoulders, waving him off as you moved towards the bathroom and relented, &ldquo;Whatever, Stars and Stripes.&rdquo;</p><p>He scoffed quietly with a smile and exited the room, leaving you alone once more in his room. Taking one last glance around the space, you shook your head as you entered the spacious bathroom.</p><p>The water was scalding, but he needed the distraction. His mind was slipping deeper and deeper into the void he struggled to climb out of. God, he was such an idiot, a stupid <i>fucking </i>idiot. The tears wouldn&rsquo;t stop falling, mixing with the water beads rolling down his face, breathing heavy, nose flaring.</p><p><i>They&rsquo;d wipe him soon. He knew that, and he couldn&rsquo;t stop the quell of fear that rose in his chest at the thought. Something was off about the base, it wasn&rsquo;t just in the confines of his mind, but in the place itself, the atmosphere. Something was changing. That was proven when the cell doors rattled with three commanding knocks.</i></p><p><i>A voice shouted through the thick door gruffly, &ldquo;Two minutes, both of you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He stiffened, breathing picking up as the metal arm clicked and whirred. He could hear you shuffling and he perked up at the franticness of the sound. Turning his head, he couldn&rsquo;t stop the furrow of his brow at your panicked expression. You were sliding on your feet as you scrambled to stand from the cold floor, chest rising and falling in rapid succession. Pacing was how you spent the next minute, agitated pacing as your fingers twitched at your sides. Suddenly, you sprung towards the wall, roughly pushing away a broken chunk of it to grab something. It clinked softly as you pulled it out, the chain dangling wildly, and he took an instinctual step back when you turned to him. The desperate look in your eyes took him by surprise and froze him to the spot. You took long strides to him, hands outstretched to roughly grab his, shoving the dog tags in his palm. He was stiff, fearful eyes darting between you and the necklace as you clutched onto him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you remember these?&rdquo; You questioned shakily, shaking his hand slightly.</i></p><p><i>He seemed to think hard for a moment before nodding in confusion.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Never forget these. Do you understand? Never forget these. You hold onto them with your life. This is you. These are you. Never lose that. No matter what they do to you, no matter what happens, never lose these.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He couldn&rsquo;t help but nod when the desperate tone of your voice hit his ear, taken aback by the display of emotions he was seeing, one that sharply contrasted with your normal robotic behavior. The moment was broken when the handlers returned, opening the door as they entered, calling to you to come with them. You gave him a look, silently telling him to hide the dog tags clutched in his fingers. One of the men stepped forward impatiently, hand reaching out to pull you away, and he slipped the tags into the pocket of the tattered shorts he wore. Winter moved to step back but was frozen once again when he felt your index wrap around his own. He could feel you quaking, hand shaking violently as you gave him one despaired squeeze, eyes locking with his. You had never been first to grab his finger, never the one to seek comfort first, and even when he was shaken to his core at his impending reunion with that awful machine, he felt stronger when he faced your fear. He squeezed back, confident, consoling, before he let go reluctantly and nodded for you to go where you were called.</i></p><p><i>He never saw you again.</i></p><p>The memory hit him like a truck. He&rsquo;d tried so hard to push it back, keep it from causing that familiar pain in his chest, but after confessing something to you he never thought he&rsquo;d have the misleading luxury to have and hearing nothing in return, he couldn&rsquo;t stop the images from resurfacing. So many emotions swirled around in his head: sorrow, pain, anger, betrayal, and the worst one of all, that persistent goddamn unrestrainable feeling called love. The tears were pouring down his cheeks and he let out an angered growl, the sound mixing with a sob as he brought his metal fist back and sent a punch to the wall&hellip;and right through the tiles.</p><p>You almost jumped out of your skin, a yelp escaping you as a shatter filled the shower, pieces of something hitting the tile floor at your feet. Whipping around, your jaw dropped at the sight of something silver being yanked back through the new hole in the shower wall. You swallowed thickly and took a hesitant step forward, narrowing your eyes as you took the chance and peered through the opening.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for you to decipher who it was. His head was bowed, long hair soaked from the water cascading over him, covering his face from your view. His chest was heaving, water slipping down his skin over the curves and ridges of his body, and he supported himself on the wall between you, muscles tensed. Perhaps now was an inappropriate time, seeing that he was obviously upset, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but get quite breathless at the sight. This man must have been sculpted by the goddamn <i>gods</i> because he sure looked it. Yes, you&rsquo;d seen him undressed before, privacy being a foreign concept at HYDRA, but this image was <i>very</i> unexpected, and you swallowed thickly, shifting on your feet before clearing your throat awkwardly.</p><p>His head shot up quickly, eyes wide as he stumbled back from the wall, nearly slipping. The curtain of his hair parted, swinging from the weight the water added to it, and you finally got to see his face. God you wish you hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Although the spray of water masked the tears tracking down his cheeks, his eyes told you everything. They were red and puffy, a kind of soul-crushing exhaustion, of the likes in which you had never seen, dimming the usually brilliant blue. Your arms subconsciously moved to cover your chest and you flattened your back to the wall, hiding yourself from his view. You took a deep breath, maintaining as much of your composure as you could.</p><p>&ldquo;God fucking dammit..&rdquo; He muttered to himself bowing his head again with a great sigh.</p><p>There was a pang in your chest, a tug at the strings of your heart as you closed your eyes, a tear you didn&rsquo;t know you had slipped down your cheek as your lip quivered. <i>Breathe, stay in control.</i> Fat lot of good that did.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the words broke through your lips on a feeble sob, hand shooting up to stem the flow before you said anything more.</p><p>Bucky froze at the sound, head rising slowly as his brows knitted together. He took a moment to breathe, replaying the noise over in his mind, processing it. That kiss was such a stupid idea, he knew that. The realization smacked him the moment it did you and it had been weighing on him since, the gravity of his actions pulling him apart from the inside, but there was a sliver of him that was sure it was all worth it. It tugged at him, yanking his head in all directions trying to get him to pull his shit together, suck it up, and own it. He kissed you, and he loved it. He took that risk, and he was going to own up to it. Whatever happens next, he can handle, as long as he&rsquo;s got you handling it too.</p><p>Aside from his sigh of resignation, he was silent and nodding to himself as a form of encouragement, he lifted his hand, squeezing his hand through the hole in the wall as much as he could and waited.</p><p>Normally, if he was first to extend his hand it was a silent plea for <i>your</i> reassurance, but this time, however, it felt different. Something in the way the air hung in the atmosphere, in the way your chest was tight and your breath was hitching in your throat, was different. You knew now, it was no request for comfort on his side, it was a gift of it&hellip;to you.</p><p>Sucking in a breath, you shyly lifted your hand, curling your finger around his and squeezing, desperately, and the tenseness of your finger lingered a bit too long before you relaxed and waited painstakingly to feel it reciprocated.</p><p>A second went by as Bucky debated in his own head if he should just let go, not give it back, show you what it feels like to put your heart out and get nothing back, but he mentally slapped himself for thinking like that and squeezed: Short, firm, and then relaxed.</p><p>He could hear you audible sigh in relief and he frowned at the idea that you almost <i>expected</i> him not to requite. Your finger seemed to twitch slightly, before you hesitantly pulled away, releasing him. He removed his hand from the opening and, after a moment of thought, turned off the water and got out.</p><p>When you heard the shower cut off, you peered through the hole sadly and found no one in sight.</p><p>~~<br /></p><p>You sat awkwardly on the chair at Steve&rsquo;s desk, constantly adjusting the clothes you&rsquo;d found laying on the bed when you stepped out of the bathroom. Your heart was racing despite your incessant attempts to calm it and you squirmed in your seat. Steve would return soon, and you dreaded the company he would bring. A talk was in order, a big talk, that you had no chance of opting out of.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep running, you have to face this. You played a hand in getting into this.&rdquo; You chastised yourself quietly, closing your eyes and adding under your breath, &ldquo;not his fault you broke your one rule, Idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>With a groan, you rubbed your hands over your face roughly. Footsteps sounded down the hall and you tensed, straightening yourself as you prepared to face the unpleasant conversation. The door opened slowly, stopping halfway as someone spoke softly outside then continuing in its tracks as Steve walked in. He blocked the doorway, not fully entering the room as he flashed you a pitying smile.</p><p>&ldquo;There are some final things I need to work out before we get moving, I need to go talk to my friends who are helping us and,&rdquo; Steve paused, glancing behind him quickly before he lowered his voice, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve got some things to work out in private.&rdquo;</p><p>He sidestepped, and your heart stopped as Bucky stepped in, halting in front of Steve when his eyes met yours. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder and leaned in, head turned towards the hallway.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stubborn,&rdquo; he whispered to him, giving him a stern look before patting his shoulder and leaving the two of you alone, shutting the door.</p><p>You both were at a stalemate, the air thick with unspoken words, and neither of you made any moves to speak. His gaze had dropped from yours, lowering to the ground as he shifted on his feet and cleared his throat awkwardly.</p><p>You swallowed, rising from your chair as you willed yourself to speak, and forced, &ldquo;Bucky, I-&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his hand and you were silent instantly, hanging on the edge of his fingers like they pulled the very strings of your mind. Your mouth went dry and whatever you planned on saying in that moment melted away as you breathed heavily, heart pounding in your ears. His demeanor seemed to morph in phases, shifting from one emotion to another until he settled on conscientious.</p><p>Lowering his hand smoothly, he gestured for you to sit back down, taking careful steps to take his own seat on the edge of the bed. The silence hung heavy in the air but you didn&rsquo;t dare disturb it. He had complete control over the situation, something unusual for you due to the fact that by nature, you forced yourself into the position of leader, and despite your mind raging in protest, you gave the authority to him unfalteringly. The only sound that filled the room was his steadied breaths and the soft hum of his left arm as he wrung his hands in his lap. His head was bowed but for once, his hair didn&rsquo;t hide is face fore he had tucked the strands behind his ear as he lowered to the mattress, allowing you to see the intricacies of his expression as he carefully plucked the words from his mind and placed them together before opening his mouth to share the particularly formulated thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be mad at you for backing out of whatever it was that I was trying to start. Yes, before I was. I was honestly pissed and I&rsquo;m sure you picked that up. I felt like you just ripped my heart out of my chest and I was selfish in the way I acted. I should have realized how stupid it was, how horribly timed it was&hellip;I just wanted to believe&hellip;I was <i>desperate</i> to believe we were ready for something&hellip;that you even <i>wanted</i> something between us. I should never have put words in your mouth or pushed anything on you, and I definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have said&hellip;what I said. Those aren&rsquo;t words you can just throw at someone, they&rsquo;re not easy words to digest, they weigh too much to just drop on a person, and it was wrong of me to do that. It wasn&rsquo;t fair to you. I wasn&rsquo;t right for me to put that on you,&rdquo; Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a deep breath before looking you in the eyes with a gentle determination, &ldquo;Regardless of that, I did mean it. I know to say that kind of defeats the purpose of everything I just told you but I just need to say it. I don&rsquo;t expect anything back from you, I really don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not asking you to give me anything back in return, you don&rsquo;t owe me anything, I don&rsquo;t want you to feel pressured to say it back or <i>anything</i>. It was stupid of me to say it but I don&rsquo;t&hellip;I don&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</p><p>Time seemed to slow with every word that fell from his lips and your heart was thundering in your chest. Dizziness overtook you and you shot out your arm to grip the desk beside you. Your head was spinning, thoughts swirling at breakneck speed, grasping aimlessly at the words he&rsquo;d spoken to you, willing yourself to hold onto them and wrestle them into becoming clear to you.</p><p>Someone loves you and they don&rsquo;t regret it. Someone who knows very well the dangers that come with attachments to you, the heartbreak, the pain, someone who knows how broken you are no matter how hard you&rsquo;ve tried to hide it, <i>loves you. </i>Despite it all, they actually love you.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t realized you&rsquo;d zoned out until two strong hands planted themselves gently on you, one on your knee and the other on your cheek. You looked down, but had to blink a few times to bring his face into view, his eyebrows furrowed and a piece of his hair had fallen from its place behind his ear from the speed in which he had jumped to you.</p><p>His grip on your face was firm, forcing you to keep him in view as he whispered, &ldquo;Hey, breathe. I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you.&rdquo;</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t realized you were hyperventilating until his words clicked in your mind and you sucked in a deep breath, pulling your head back from his hand. Shaking your head, you brushed your hands roughly over your pants, trying to keep them from twitching.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I just&hellip;I&rsquo;m fine. I just&hellip;God, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you stuttered, dropping your head in your hands with an angered groan, &ldquo;This is just&hellip;Listen, Barnes, I&rsquo;m not used to being overwhelmed, it&rsquo;s not normal for me. But I broke my one rule and I&rsquo;m freaking out. I don&rsquo;t get emotional and it&rsquo;s fucking up my brain right now. Your stupid goddamn beautiful face is screwing me up.&rdquo;</p><p>The muffled words tumbled from your mouth against your will, and the moment your jumbled brain caught up with reality, you gaped. Eyes going wide, you lifted your head to face his mouth opening and closing in shock. Bucky cocked his head, leaning back slightly as he replayed your words, an array of emotions crossing his face. You were close to bolting after what seemed like ages of him just staring at you before you stopped at the twitch of his lips. They began to curl into a hesitant grin, unsteady in their path up his cheeks before solidifying their place, displaying his perfect teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo; A soft laugh left him, mingling with the air and his words, the smile now hard-set.</p><p>You wanted to run. God, you just wanted to jump out of that fucking window and never show your face in New York again &nbsp;What the hell were you thinking saying something like that? We you some kind of idiot?</p><p>&ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t mean it&hellip;Well i did mean it i-&rdquo; you stammered and huffed, shoving him as you rushed, &ldquo;Listen, I don&rsquo;t know much about love or feelings or whatever, but I&hellip; I guess I&hellip;like you too,&rdquo; The hesitation in your own voice &nbsp;made you cringe and you put your hand up to stop him from moving away as he frowned, &ldquo;God that sounded so bad, I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t even know how to say this. You&rsquo;re different to me. I know that much. I..think about you differently, I regard you differently, I interact with you differently. You&rsquo;re not just some other person to me, I know I feel at least <i>something</i> with you. Even though I&rsquo;m sure of that, and I&rsquo;m sorry for this, I don&rsquo;t think I can say..you know what back, at least not yet. Don&rsquo;t take that the wrong way, please, I&rsquo;m just worried about starting something that won&rsquo;t end well between us. I only have a few rules for myself, but this one is huge, it&rsquo;s my biggest rule, and I&rsquo;m shattering it. &nbsp;I made those rules to protect myself because I don&rsquo;t know how much more I can take. My whole life&rsquo;s been a shit show and..meeting you was the best thing to ever come out of it. I don&rsquo;t want to lose you too. If I tell you I love you and then I find I can&rsquo;t keep that up, I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself for dragging you through that pain. Please understand, James. I do care about you, and you mean a hell of a lot to me, and maybe..maybe I truly do love you, but I&rsquo;m not ready to say that yet.&rdquo;</p><p>Of all the things you&rsquo;ve done in this world, all the missions, escaping, being on the run, and staying alive, you began to wonder if they even compared to this moment right here. This was the hardest thing you&rsquo;ve ever down in your life: Share pure, personal, honesty. You wondered if the fear was evident on your face, if he could see the stop of your chest as you held your breath, waiting. It felt like your whole existence was riding on this moment, on his response. You supposed, in a way it did, due in part to the fact that if he rejects you, your only support in this would be destroyed and you&rsquo;d be thrown in a prison and forgotten. It&rsquo;s funny, how life plays the string of irony, turning the tables on things you thought you knew. You&rsquo;d only ever had two purposes in life, the line between them somehow vaguely blurred: Protector and executioner. But now, as you sat in your seat, feeling your world crack with each second that ticked by, you were neither one nor the other. Your life and the very strings that held it together were now the targets, and you waited to see which purpose Bucky would fulfill; would he patch these ripping threads back together, or make the final cut to destroy them forever?</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, he finally stirred the stagnant air, leaning back and nodding his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he started, a gentle smile tugging at his lips, &ldquo;I can work with &lsquo;maybe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>A warm sensation began to spread through your chest, one you couldn&rsquo;t place. It was unfamiliar, new, and never before experienced but every single fiber of the feeling was wonderfully indescribable. It felt as if someone had filled every little crack and healed every little imperfection of your scarred heart with a gentle kiss of sunshine. You wondered if it was glowing through your chest, rattling against your bones with an insatiable urge to leap from you and kiss the star that eased its ache. That tired organ deserved as much, so you appeased it&rsquo;s desire and pressed it close to that perfect sun.</p><p>The action surprised you both, but you made no attempt to stop yourself as you launched from your chair and wrapped your arms firmly around the man in front of you, squeezing like your life depended on it. In a way, it did, so you gripped a little stronger and let out a breath. The warmth grew when his own arms curled around you, his soft chuckle kissing your ear as the cool metal of his fingers carded through your hair, holding you safely against him, pressing your hearts as close as possible. You could have sworn you felt yours reaching for his, as his own beat softly through you, playing with the rhythm of your rejuvenated heart.</p><p>&ldquo;I owe you everything,&rdquo; you breathed out, words weaving through the strands of his hair that your face had nuzzled itself into.</p><p>He pressed his face softly into your shoulder, and you weren&rsquo;t sure if you were imagining things, or if you truly felt his lips place a feather light kiss upon it before he spoke, his voice addictingly gravely, &ldquo;Yes you do. And I know exactly how you can pay me back,&rdquo; you started to lift your head to look at him but he held you firmly in place as he continued, &ldquo;Live your life the way you want to, make yourself happy, and don&rsquo;t let fear stop you from that. Make bold choices, take risks! That&rsquo;s where the fun is at!&rdquo;</p><p>You pulled back to look at him and teased, &ldquo;Well, now you&rsquo;re just stealing my lines.&rdquo;</p><p>He let out a laugh, an airy chuckle that floated through the air softly and lightened the atmosphere of the room. It was contagious, and soon a similar sound escaped you as your hands slid down his arms to rest on his hands, squeezing them gently. Your mind drifted from the present- Was this what home felt like? The weight on your shoulders and the burden on your mind seemed bearable now, easier, and for once, letting your walls down didn&rsquo;t seem so scary. With the man in front of you to stand guard, you were always&hellip;safe.</p><p>That was the first time in your life you&rsquo;d ever really believed that.</p><p>&ldquo;We should probably get going,&rdquo; you started reluctantly, not wanting to break the moment, but you knew no more time could be wasted, &ldquo;Rogers is probably ready to go.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed, smile still present on his lips as he looked down at your hands clasped together, nodding, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We need to get you out of here before the rest of the team realizes you&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p><p>He stood slowly from the ground, looking down with a blissful grin, extending his hand. You took it gratefully, and the both of you collected yourselves to regroup with Steve.</p><p>~~</p><p>Bucky had received a text to meet Steve and the others in the hangar, and after carefully sneaking your way there, the two of you stood in front of a whirring jet, the ramp resting on the ground. Steve stood at the foot of it, alongside Sam Wilson and a young girl you just barely recognized as Wanda Maximoff, who seemed to tense slightly at the sight of you. Keeping your expression neutral and your distance generous, you gave a curt nod of acknowledgment to the group.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky,&rdquo; Steve greeted, before turning to you and making brief introductions, &ldquo;(Y/N), this is Sam Wilson, who you&rsquo;ve met, and Wanda Maximoff, who I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve made each other&rsquo;s acquaintances. They&rsquo;re our help on the inside, they&rsquo;ll do whatever they can to keep the heat off of us and keep the team off our trail.&rdquo;</p><p>You piled the bricks of your mental walls up quickly, making sure each one was in its own perfect spot before closing the space between you and Steve&rsquo;s friends, extending your hand in salutation. Wilson reciprocated quickly, a firm but short handshake that was accompanied unexpectedly by a flirtatious smirk and a wink sent in the direction of Bucky behind you. Your eyes narrowed as you pulled your hand back with a bite of irritation and moved on to the girl beside him. Her interaction contrasted greatly with Sam&rsquo;s, her moves calculated but performed with hesitation, her guard up as high as it could go. You wondered if perhaps her trepidation was not only a result of your reputation but from her extraordinary ability to read minds, leading her to see first hand what was only scrawled into files that barely scratched the surface of the true nature of their horrors. It was better not to worry yourself with things you couldn&rsquo;t control, so you tucked the thought away and forced a quick smile, ending the handshake and locking your stance back again.</p><p>After the awkward exchange, Steve cut all interactions short, thanking his friends a few more times for the help before ushering you and Bucky onto the jet.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to move quickly, before the team finds out you&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo; Steve rushed, directing the both of you up the ramp.</p><p>He entered last, sending a wave to his friends who returned the gesture as the ramp lifted to a close.</p><p>The craft was different from the ones you&rsquo;d seen, bigger in every way. The ramp connected to the side rather than the back, and further towards the end of the jet was a few separate cabins, one you assumed was for sleeping and the like. A very small medical &ldquo;center&rdquo; was tucked into the corner off the main area, across from the seats and weapons holder. Three stuffed duffel bags sat on the cot, lined up in a row. You raised an eyebrow, barely getting the chance to point at them before Steve started.</p><p>&ldquo;You two are trouble,&rdquo; he scolded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be insane to send you both off into hiding without me.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirked slightly at him, a quiet huff leaving you as you walked towards the back of the jet. You wanted to fall into a more carefree feeling, but something felt off and you noticed the distance between the two best friends behind you.</p><p>Bucky seemed to keep space between him and Steve, a lost look on his face that conflicted with the sureness of his posture. Agitation was evident in his body language, clenching fists hung at his sides, shoulders hunched slightly as he breathed with a steady heaviness. The blonde turned to him with a questioning look but was only met with silence as Bucky shook his head to himself and yanked the duffel bag from its place, moving to toss it into the back.</p><p>Confused, you glanced at him, wordlessly asking if he was alright. His eyes met yours, and with an expression of determination, he turned back around to face Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N), your bag&rsquo;s on the left, go pick a cot,&rdquo; Bucky didn&rsquo;t so much as side eye you, and the commanding tone of his voice left no room for argument. Silently, you grabbed the bag, excusing yourself quietly from the uncomfortable atmosphere and practically running to the back room, desperate to remove yourself from in between the now growing tension.</p><p>Bucky swallowed thickly, taking a few deep breaths as he shifted on his feet. Steve fought back the urge to ask him questions, finding it the better idea to wait and let the man speak first. Something troubling was obviously on his mind, and out of respect of that, Rogers remained unspeaking, allowing his friend to formulate his words.</p><p>It took a few tries, his mouth opening and closing a few times before he finally started to speak, &ldquo;I appreciate the help, Steve, I really do, we&rsquo;d be screwed without it, but I just&hellip; Something is on my mind and I just can&rsquo;t shake it.&rdquo; His tone slowly started to grow in anger, a seed of disappointment rooted in the center as he lifted his head to bore his gaze into Steve&rsquo;s, &ldquo;You knew about the plan to arrest her. You were there when it was spelled out&hellip;but how fucking long did you know before we got back? Why the hell didn&rsquo;t you warn me before so I could have avoided it all together? I could have just waited it out. She never would have been shoved in that cage, we could have saved her all that stress. Steve, we..&rdquo; he paused, breathing fast in exasperation, &ldquo;We could have screwed up everything. I could have lost whatever trust she had in me. I never would have gotten that back.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve frowned, unable to even get a syllable out before Bucky seemed to come to another revelation, a sadness beginning to entwine itself with his vexation, &ldquo;You knew I&hellip;Y-you knew I loved her. I didn&rsquo;t have to say it. You knew I <i>loved</i> her, while you sat in that meeting and listened to them plan to cage her like an animal, and you couldn&rsquo;t even spare me a heads up?&rdquo;</p><p>The man let out a great sigh, shoulders slumping in defeat as he shook his head, &ldquo;Bucky, I&hellip;&rdquo; words seemed to escape him, a sick feeling rising from the pit of his soul, but he owed his friend a great deal for his mistakes, so he pushed the sounds out of his mouth, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything that will fix this, I know that. I have no explanation for you, I can&rsquo;t apologize hard enough, or describe how awful I feel. You&rsquo;re my best friend, and I let you down. I betrayed you. I should have warned you, but I was acting like a total dumbass. I&rsquo;m sorry, Bucky. But I am going to make it up to you. I swear on my life. Starting right now, whatever you need, whatever <i>she</i> needs, I&rsquo;m here. I will fight as hard for her as I fought for you and that&rsquo;s a promise.&rdquo;</p><p>He wanted to stay angry, a part of him wanted to scream, call Steve every name in the book, but the pure sincerity in his friend&rsquo;s aura calmed the feeling. He radiated the very definition of the word earnest and Bucky could no longer hold the man in front of him in contempt. The tension in his body slowly left with every breath that filtered through his lungs, but he kept his head lowered, keeping his face shielded by his hair so he could work through his thoughts by himself. Steve watched with anticipation to see if his words got through to Barnes, and soon felt a wave of relief wash over him when the man nodded, raising his head to look into his eyes with a soft smile of forgiveness.</p><p>Steve stepped forward, pulling him into a firm hug, which Bucky reciprocated tiredly. It dawned on him, the pure exhaustion in the Soldier&rsquo;s features, and with a final pat on the back, he gestured him towards the back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flying, Buck. You two should get some rest.&rdquo; He nodded towards the closed door behind which you stood, ear pressed to the metal.</p><p>When you heard Bucky agree and his footsteps start towards you, you darted from the door, standing in front of your cot and pretending to rummage through your bag. He stepped through with a heavy sigh, closing the door as he bent over to grab his own bag from the floor and tossing it onto the bed across from yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry about that, I just&hellip;needed to talk about something.&rdquo; He flashed you an apologetic smile.</p><p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; you flashed him a smile in return, but it faltered at the corners of your lips, and you turned your head away from him.</p><p>A frown took over Bucky&rsquo;s face, and he crossed his arms, leaning against his bed, &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>It was a simple question really, so why did you have such a hard time answering it? Those words, those small, unimpressive words weighed heavily on your shoulders and you struggled to find the way to reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it worth it to you?&rdquo; You started softly, hesitantly turning to face him, &ldquo;Am&hellip;<i>I</i> worth it to you? This is a lot of trouble you and Steve are going through for me and I&rsquo;m just not sure if I&rsquo;m worth it. Maybe it would be best for me to just get dropped off somewhere, give me a headstart, and I&rsquo;ll just go back on the run. It would probably be easiest. I can be gone in seconds, get out of your hair. I&rsquo;ve already stupidly let myself settle in too much.&rdquo;</p><p>Your fingers were twitching at your sides, and you clasped your hands in front of you to stop them. You were divided in your own mind, one half of you was sure this was the right decision. The rules you set for yourself and the walls you built were your protection, and keeping them together was the right thing to do, no matter what you sacrificed. But on the other side, you were screaming on the inside, telling yourself to <b><i>just shut up.</i></b> That half of you was aching, reaching out to Bucky and hoping beyond all hope he&rsquo;d look at you like you were crazy and completely disregard your suggestion. And, as if for once in your life the stars shined above you and fate wished something other than ill upon you, he did exactly that.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he took a bewildered step forward, arms uncrossing as his eyebrow shot up, &ldquo;Absolutely not. (Y/N), I know you&rsquo;re not used to all this but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve gotta run from it. I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> letting you run from it. Do you really want to go back to that life? Back on the run?&rdquo;</p><p>Swallowing, you stuttered, &ldquo;N-no I just..I-I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Panic was a strange and unusual sensation, and it took you a few seconds to realize its unique feeling. Your breathing picked up slightly, mouth running dry as you wrung your fingers together. You were going against everything you&rsquo;d learned over the course of your life, <i>again</i>, and it sent your brain into chaos. If it were a computer, you&rsquo;re sure it would have short-circuited and exploded.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just still conflicted, Bucky. I&rsquo;m sorry. I hate taking you on this loop but it&rsquo;s all just so new to me and my nerves are fried. Everything I&rsquo;ve learned trying to survive all my life is in direct contradiction to everything I&rsquo;m doing right now and it&rsquo;s really crossing my wires here. I don&rsquo;t want to be on the run anymore. I really don&rsquo;t. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I&rsquo;m so fucking tired of running. I want&hellip;I&rsquo;ve dreamed of a normal life since I was allowed to let my thoughts wander without getting thrown back into that god awful chair. I know this is my chance. But I never thought I&rsquo;d get it and now that it&rsquo;s here I&rsquo;m&hellip;I&rsquo;m not as ready as I thought I&rsquo;d be to take it.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed deeply, gesturing for you to sit. After a moment&rsquo;s contemplation, you obliged and to your surprise, he moved to sit next to you, plopping down beside you. He took a moment to collect his thoughts before speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Doll, I know what you&rsquo;re going through. I went through the same thing when Steve showed up at my apartment in Bucharest. Again, my whole life got flipped on its head and I had no idea what to do, what decisions to make. At first, even I ran from it. Literally. I didn&rsquo;t expect it. I was&hellip;honestly, I was scared, terrified even, and I almost let that chance of a new life slip away. If I wasn&rsquo;t stopped, even though it wasn&rsquo;t in good circumstances, I would have got away and never turned back. I never would have reunited with Steve, never would have recovered, met the team. I would have lost my second chance. I can&rsquo;t imagine if that happened.&rdquo; He paused for a moment, nodding to himself as if it would help to push the words out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you miss your chance. You deserve it more than I can say and I&rsquo;ll do anything to ensure you get it. I know you&rsquo;re scared, even though you won&rsquo;t admit that, but I&rsquo;m here for you. Hell, Steve is here for you. We&rsquo;re going to fight for you until the team sees what we see, and then we&rsquo;re going to help you recover. You&rsquo;ll get the same programs, opportunities, and resources that I had.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at the ground for a moment, processing the words, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t&hellip;But, James, I don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>The speed in which Bucky whipped his head towards you made you jump. His hand came to rest firmly on your leg as he asserted, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare say that. You do deserve it, completely deserve it. And I know you want it, so take it. Your past doesn&rsquo;t matter, (Y/N), it wasn&rsquo;t up to you. HYDRA can suck it, because you&rsquo;re getting your second chance. No ifs, ands, or buts. Darlin&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re a good person, no matter what you think, and I&rsquo;m going to make sure your future reflects that.&rdquo;</p><p>In that moment, with the intensity of his electric blue eyes, it seemed impossible to tear your gaze from his. There was an unfamiliar sting behind your eyes and your breath hitched in your throat. An urge overtook you that you couldn&rsquo;t fight, and you threw yourself on him, wrapping your arms tightly around his neck in an awkward hug. He shifted on the mattress to better the angle as he encased you in his hold.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to run anymore.&rdquo; you whimpered softly into his shoulder, fingers digging a little harder into his shirt, &ldquo;I want someone to care. I&rsquo;m tired of being a background character in my own life. I&rsquo;m tired of always having to hide. I don&rsquo;t want to be invisible just until someone needs something from me. I just want someone to <i>see me. </i>I just&hellip;I just want someone to care. <i> </i>&rdquo;</p><p>When the fabric of his clothes began to dampen against his skin, he tightened his hold, and couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from planting a kiss to the side of your head, &ldquo;I see you, Doll, I see you. And I care about you, so fucking much. You don&rsquo;t have to be invisible anymore. You&rsquo;re safe with me. Always.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-you know,&rdquo; you hiccupped, taking a breath, &ldquo;you know you&rsquo;re the first person I&rsquo;ve ever met who&rsquo;s been there for me. I&rsquo;ve never had someone&hellip;comfort me before. After that nightmare in Germany&hellip;I tried to forget it and pretend it didn&rsquo;t happen, but that meant something to me. That was the first time in my life someone comforted me, truly comforted me. It changed things for me. It was such a strange feeling but it was&hellip;it was an amazing feeling. I felt like someone was seeing <i>me</i> and not the mask I was wearing to hide behind,&rdquo; you paused, taking in the scent of him in hopes it would give you the courage to get your next words out, &ldquo;Bucky,&rdquo; he hummed when you stopped again, hand sliding down your back to rest on your hip, &ldquo;You make me feel like me again.&rdquo;</p><p>He stiffened underneath you, and he felt like his heart shot a line out to yours and, for the first time, your heart caught it and held it tightly. He was speechless, a joyous warmth feeling his whole being.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he barely registered your gentle voice before he felt you plant a soft, sweet kiss to his cheek, sliding off his lap and padding gently to the bathroom.</p><p>His skin began turning a deep shade of pink that covered his neck and cheeks and seeped into his bones as he sat lost in a lovesick stupor.</p><p>You stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes, drying the tears that had fallen down your cheeks and just breathed. Looking into the mirror, you nodded to yourself, taking a moment to make peace with the path you were choosing to go down. This choice gives you the greatest opportunity for a good future, you&rsquo;d regret not making it. Nodding firmly to yourself, you exited the room shyly.</p><p>Bucky was leaning over his bed, rummaging through his duffel bag when you reentered, and he turned to flash you a kind smile. Returning the gesture came almost automatically, and you walked silently over to your own.</p><p>Clearing your throat, your let out a soft laugh and joked, &ldquo;This is the part where I make a funny remark and pretend I wasn&rsquo;t just crying like a little bitch a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned delicately and sighed in an almost blissed out way, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a &lsquo;little bitch&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not helping here, I&rsquo;m trying to be sarcastic and avoidant of my humanity,&rdquo; you quipped.</p><p>His smile widened with a small laugh. He opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by a yawn that broke free from your lips. You shot your hand up to stifle the noise and Bucky couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was just about to say how tired I was, guess you agree with me.&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckled with a nod, shoving the duffel off the bed and plopping down on it to take your shoes off.</p><p>The both of you proceeded to get ready to sleep, exchange glances and little giggles back and forth before deciding you were ready to hit the hay.</p><p>Bucky turned off the lights after you had settled under your covers, shuffling around a bit more before laying down in his own bed.</p><p>Silence filled the darkness for a few seconds before he broke it again, &ldquo;So, I have a question.&rdquo;</p><p>You picked yourself up from your bed slightly, &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In Germany,&rdquo; he started, and the sound of his rustling sheets filled the air as he turned in your direction, &ldquo;Do you actually cuddle in your sleep or was that all you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, Bucky, you&rsquo;re insufferable,&rdquo; you scoffed, rolling your eyes despite his inability to see and plopped back into mattress before teasing sarcastically, &ldquo;Crawl into my bed in the middle of the night and find out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&nbsp;tempt me, Sugar.&rdquo;</p><p><b><a href=\"http://orderofthefanfic.tumblr.com/post/180962328283\">Next part</a></b></p>",

That was the feeling that filled him to the brim, pure and utter bliss. It flowed through him like a river, replacing his blood with the beauty of your smile. It was his lifeline now, the only thing he&rsquo;d ever need. It pulled him to lean in again, crashing his lips back into yours with fever, pouring more emotions into it, putting his soul into it like he never had before. His hands gripped your waist tightly, and it was almost as if you could feel his desperation through his fingertips. Fireworks were popping in your brain. You&rsquo;re flying.
