Just give it an another try.&rdquo; I say, getting up from my seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, there is a car over there,&rdquo; he says.</p><p> &ldquo;I know. I saw that already. It&rsquo;s parked, I guess.&rdquo; We get down from the bike.</p><p>&ldquo;There must be people around then,&rdquo; he says and starts walking towards the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think people in the middle of the road, at the middle of the night are good people.&rdquo; I say, walking behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m all good. And believe me, you are not that bad,&rdquo; he says, as we both continue walking.</p><p>   &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s in the car.&rdquo; He says peeking inside the car.</p><p>&ldquo;I think there is a fire over there.&rdquo; I say, pointing at the woods.</p><p>&ldquo; Fire means people. Let&rsquo;s go greet them.&rdquo; He says and looks at me. &ldquo;Oh , Come on now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This is a terrible idea.&rdquo; I say but follow.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at all those people. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo; He says. I pull him behind a tree as he tries to greet them.</p><p>  &ldquo;Well, a bunch of teen girls. How do you think they can help us?&rdquo; I ask.</p><p>  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know. Let&rsquo;s ask them what they can do.&rdquo; He says and greets them.</p><p>&ldquo; Hello, lovely ladies,&rdquo; he says with a slight bow. Overacting.</p><p>  &ldquo;Oh! Hello,&rdquo; says one of them. They were sitting around a fire and now all of them are on their feets, staring at us, suspiciously. They are six in total. At least no one looks drunk.</p><p>    &ldquo;We were on our way and suddenly our bike broke down. Do you think you can help.&rdquo; I say, hoping they&rsquo;ll say No and we&rsquo;ll leave.</p><p>   &ldquo;Oh! Well that&rsquo;s bad. You can stay here till dawn, if you like to.&rdquo; Says the girl, who had greeted Sirius.</p><p>Before I can open my mouth to say anything, Sirius accepts the offer. </p><p>  &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s introduce ourselves. I&rsquo;m Sirius Black. And he&rsquo;s my friend Remus Lupin.&rdquo; </p><p>   &ldquo;Nice to meet you. I&rsquo;m Rosy and they&rsquo;re my friends. Mentha, Molly, Susan, Taryn and Heather.&rdquo; </p><p>I&rsquo;m sitting on a log. Alone. I forgot their names as soon as she finished but Sirius remembers them. He has seated himself with them around the fire. Talking. Joking. Laughing.</p><p>I hear him calling my name but I pretend otherwise.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, didn&rsquo;t you hear me. I was calling you.&rdquo; He says, standing in front of me. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin your fun,&rdquo; I say. He sits besides me and I can feel him staring at me.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not looking at him and I won&rsquo;t.</p><p>He clears his throat and says, &ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t like this but I can&rsquo;t see why. They&rsquo;re all nice and Molly has such a good sense of humour.&rdquo;</p><p>  &ldquo;Well, what happened to your plan?&rdquo; I ask.</p><p>  &ldquo;What plan?&rdquo; How can he forget about his own plan. </p><p>&ldquo;About James and lily. You wanted to surprise them by an early visit. How can you forget. We didn&rsquo;t leave our beds to spent a night in woods. At least I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He is starting at me.

I&rsquo;m so sorry, Remus.I didn&rsquo;t wanted to stop but that damn bike. At least you can&rsquo;t blame that on me.&rdquo; He says. He takes my hand in his and continues, &ldquo;Tell me what you want me to do now. I mean I can&rsquo;t understand what do you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Sirius, come here. I&rsquo;ll show you something,&rdquo; shouts Molly, I guess. I don&rsquo;t exactly know who she is.</p><p> &ldquo;A minute please,&rdquo; he says to them and then looks at me and asks again, &ldquo;What is it you want.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, I must accept that it was a good decision to stay here, around the fire. So, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p><p>   &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like to stay here?&rsquo; I thought to myself.</p><p>  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any problem if we stay here till dawn. It&rsquo;s only 3 hours from now.&rdquo; I say. Then I pause, open my mouth and shuts it again.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t say what I want. He has planed to do it, he even has practiced it. So I won&rsquo;t say it. </p><p>  &ldquo;Well, what is it then?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>  &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like them.&rdquo; I say, nodding towards the girls. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be with them.&rdquo; I want you to be with me is the unspoken rest.</p><p>  &ldquo;Hey Sirius, we going in our tents,&rdquo; says one of the girl. &ldquo;That one is for you and your friend. You two have to share. That&rsquo;s all we can manage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Sirius says to her and they all vanish in their tents.</p><p>&ldquo;Remus,&rdquo; he says looking into my eyes, &ldquo;you have more to say, don&rsquo;t you? Just say it.&rdquo; He says. The words are so soft on his lips that it takes me my everything to stop myself from kissing them.</p><p>  &ldquo;There is&hellip;.nothing.&rdquo; I say, my breath so uneven that anyone can tell that I&rsquo;m lying. And he&rsquo;s Sirius, he always knows.</p><p>  &ldquo;Just say it, Remus,&rdquo; he says and cups my face in his hands.</p><p>  Now I can&rsquo;t resist, so I kiss him. Deep but brief. Oh God! His lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to be with me. I want you to be mine. Now and forever.&rdquo; I say, finally.</p><p>  &ldquo;All yours, Remus Lupin.&rdquo; He says and kisses me.

Especially at night.</p><p>We are going to James and lily\u2019s, for Christmas. They are expecting us tomorrow evening but Sirius has dicided to surprise them with an early visit.

This is useless.\u201d He says, finally giving up. \u201cThis thing ain\u2019t gonna start.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? We are not gonna stay here. Just give it an another try.\u201d I say, getting up from my seat.</p><p>\u201cLook, there is a car over there,\u201d he says.</p><p> \u201cI know. I saw that already. It\u2019s parked, I guess.\u201d We get down from the bike.</p><p>\u201cThere must be people around then,\u201d he says and starts walking towards the car.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think people in the middle of the road, at the middle of the night are good people.\u201d I say, walking behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m all good. And believe me, you are not that bad,\u201d he says, as we both continue walking.</p><p>   \u201cNo one\u2019s in the car.\u201d He says peeking inside the car.</p><p>\u201cI think there is a fire over there.\u201d I say, pointing at the woods.</p><p>\u201c Fire means people. Let\u2019s go greet them.\u201d He says and looks at me. \u201cOh , Come on now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is a terrible idea.\u201d I say but follow.</p><p>\u201cLook at all those people. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll help.\u201d He says. I pull him behind a tree as he tries to greet them.</p><p>  \u201cWell, a bunch of teen girls. How do you think they can help us?\u201d I ask.</p><p>  \u201cI don\u2019t exactly know. Let\u2019s ask them what they can do.\u201d He says and greets them.</p><p>\u201c Hello, lovely ladies,\u201d he says with a slight bow. Overacting.</p><p>  \u201cOh! Hello,\u201d says one of them. They were sitting around a fire and now all of them are on their feets, staring at us, suspiciously. They are six in total. At least no one looks drunk.</p><p>    \u201cWe were on our way and suddenly our bike broke down. Do you think you can help.\u201d I say, hoping they\u2019ll say No and we\u2019ll leave.</p><p>   \u201cOh! Well that\u2019s bad. You can stay here till dawn, if you like to.\u201d Says the girl, who had greeted Sirius.</p><p>Before I can open my mouth to say anything, Sirius accepts the offer. </p><p>  \u201cNow, let\u2019s introduce ourselves. I\u2019m Sirius Black. And he\u2019s my friend Remus Lupin.\u201d </p><p>   \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Rosy and they\u2019re my friends. Mentha, Molly, Susan, Taryn and Heather.\u201d </p><p>I\u2019m sitting on a log. Alone. I forgot their names as soon as she finished but Sirius remembers them. He has seated himself with them around the fire. Talking. Joking. Laughing.</p><p>I hear him calling my name but I pretend otherwise.</p><p>\u201cHey, didn\u2019t you hear me. I was calling you.\u201d He says, standing in front of me. </p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to ruin your fun,\u201d I say. He sits besides me and I can feel him staring at me.</p><p>I\u2019m not looking at him and I won\u2019t.</p><p>He clears his throat and says, \u201cI know you didn\u2019t like this but I can\u2019t see why. They\u2019re all nice and Molly has such a good sense of humour.\u201d</p><p>  \u201cWell, what happened to your plan?\u201d I ask.</p><p>  \u201cWhat plan?\u201d How can he forget about his own plan. </p><p>\u201cAbout James and lily. You wanted to surprise them by an early visit. How can you forget. We didn\u2019t leave our beds to spent a night in woods. At least I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He is starting at me. His eyes wide open, so is his mouth. He is shocked to see me so angry.</p><p>   \u201cRemus, I\u2026..I didn\u2019t knew this will upset you so much. Geez! I\u2019m so sorry, Remus.I didn\u2019t wanted to stop but that damn bike. At least you can\u2019t blame that on me.\u201d He says. He takes my hand in his and continues, \u201cTell me what you want me to do now. I mean I can\u2019t understand what do you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Sirius, come here. I\u2019ll show you something,\u201d shouts Molly, I guess. I don\u2019t exactly know who she is.</p><p> \u201cA minute please,\u201d he says to them and then looks at me and asks again, \u201cWhat is it you want.\u201d</p><p>Well, I must accept that it was a good decision to stay here, around the fire. So, I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>   \u2018Why don\u2019t you like to stay here?\u2019 I thought to myself.</p><p>  \u201cI don\u2019t have any problem if we stay here till dawn. It\u2019s only 3 hours from now.\u201d I say. Then I pause, open my mouth and shuts it again.</p><p>I can\u2019t say what I want. He has planed to do it, he even has practiced it. So I won\u2019t say it. </p><p>  \u201cWell, what is it then?\u201d He asks.</p><p>  \u201cI just don\u2019t like them.\u201d I say, nodding towards the girls. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be with them.\u201d I want you to be with me is the unspoken rest.</p><p>  \u201cHey Sirius, we going in our tents,\u201d says one of the girl. \u201cThat one is for you and your friend. You two have to share. That\u2019s all we can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Sirius says to her and they all vanish in their tents.</p><p>\u201cRemus,\u201d he says looking into my eyes, \u201cyou have more to say, don\u2019t you? Just say it.\u201d He says. The words are so soft on his lips that it takes me my everything to stop myself from kissing them.</p><p>  \u201cThere is\u2026.nothing.\u201d I say, my breath so uneven that anyone can tell that I\u2019m lying. And he\u2019s Sirius, he always knows.</p><p>  \u201cJust say it, Remus,\u201d he says and cups my face in his hands.</p><p>  Now I can\u2019t resist, so I kiss him. Deep but brief. Oh God!
