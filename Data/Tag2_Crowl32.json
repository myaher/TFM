You&rsquo;d\n been struggling to read by the light of it, but at the sight of him \napproaching, you&rsquo;d set aside your clay tablet, all of your focus on him.\n He&rsquo;d come to you, a sash highlighting his narrow waist, shawl around \nhim, and the black fabrics against the dark of night only serve to make \nhim look pale by the moonlight, but here beside the fire, he takes on a \nwarmer glow.</p><p>&ldquo;You look&hellip; beautiful, tonight.&rdquo; You say, your face \nheating, and not from the fire. You don&rsquo;t know quite how to compliment \nhim, what he might prefer to hear, but&hellip; had he not dressed to be \nbeautiful?</p><p>Besides, you know him to be a vain beast, surely he will soak up the compliment happily enough.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mess.&rdquo; He says, but he preens also, and smooths his clothing with a careful hand. &ldquo;Do you like it? It&rsquo;s not&ndash; too&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\n no.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re quick to say, and your fingers steal up, meaning to touch \nhis hair. At the last moment, nerves take you, and you finger his shawl \ninstead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Its&hellip; I thought to go down with you\n tomorrow, and&ndash; I thought I might look nice for you. Well, not&ndash;&rdquo; He \nturns away. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do a thing with my hair, though.&rdquo;</p><p>You could hardly ask for a more perfect opening.</p><p>&ldquo;May\n I?&rdquo; You dare a touch to his curls this time, and even messy, they are \nas soft beneath your fingertips as you ever did dream .</p><p><strike>You summon up a comb from the aeth</strike>\n He hands you a comb, and nods. You hum softly and begin the work of \nuntangling his titian tresses, and he relaxes as you work. You weave a \nbraid into his hair as you go. When you&rsquo;ve done, he rises, and slips \nfree of his clothing, save a modest undergarment covering his loins, and\n he kneels before you once more, his wings unfolding. To human eyes, \nthey are dark as night.</p><p>Which is how you see them also. With your human eyes.</p><p>They&rsquo;re beautiful just the same, of course, you find them breathtakingly so.</p><p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; You ask again, a whisper this time.</p><p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; He whispers back.</p><p>You\n could hardly describe the intimacy of it to another soul, there is \nnothing to equal the experience. When you touch him here, and feel the \nflutter of his wings, unused to loving touch, it is as if a door has \nopened to you, and you have come upon a new world, and that world is \nhim.

The closeness of his body and the \nway that he moves, like having a great predator loping along at your \nside, radiating power, and there beside him, you\u2019re safe. Protected.</p><p>He\n follows you up to your flat, and no sooner do you have the door locked \nthan he\u2019s upon you, has you pressed up against it to be kissed, forked \ntongue teasing at your lips, sliding into your mouth\u2026 The most wondrous \nhaze seems to descend upon you both, making the world beyond you both \nunreal. There is only Crowley, his hands on you, his mouth on you, his \nbody pressed so close to yours.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted my virtue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\n yes\u2026\u201d He hisses, fisting a hand in your hair and baring your throat to \nhis kisses. To the tickling darting touch of his tongue, and the barest \ngraze of viperine fangs, and the rough rub of his mustache against \ntender skin. \u201cI want to relieve you of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could take some time.\u201d You warn him. \u201cI\u2019m as much virtue as you are vice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\n how much vice do you think I\u2019m made of?\u201d He asks, his breath hot \nagainst your neck. He pushes his thigh between yours, sliding up to \nnudge against <strike>the spot where you would manif</strike> your sex. \nBeing as it\u2019s always in the same place and always the same shape, and \nyou never don\u2019t have it, because that would be very odd, and you are \njust a person.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a beast.\u201d You moan, and he grins against you, and nips at you just a little.</p><p>\u201cAnd\n I\u2019m about to act like one.\u201d He promises. He moves you from the door to \nthe sofa, and bends you over the back of it, strong and sudden enough to\n make you swoon. He takes your trousers down, and <strike>you</strike> he simply miracles your shirt away, along with his own clothes.</p><p>You\n feel so eager for him, enough to make you weak in the knees, and his \ngrip on your hips is firm, holding you right where he wants you as he \ntrails wet kisses up your spine. You can feel the friction of his \nmustache, and the softness of his lips, and the wicked, clever working \nof his tongue as he works his way higher. His firm prick slides between \nyour thighs, teasingly near and not near enough to where you would most \nlike it buried, he thrusts between them as his kisses now travel from \nthe center line of your spine across your upper back. And his hands \nslide up from your hips, to travel up your back as well, like the first \nslow stroke of a sensual massage.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 oh, you know what you do to\n me\u2026\u201d You rock against him, need igniting pathways along your skin, \nbringing you to life in new and thrilling ways.</p><p>\u201cI have my \nsuspicions.\u201d He admits, and his tongue traces strange sigils across one \nshoulderblade. You can feel the building pressure and need for release <strike>there</strike>, can feel him calling forth the deepest and most intimate parts of you, as he kisses and teases <strike>around the joint</strike>, as your skin tingles the way it would before a powerful storm.</p><p>Almost before you know what\u2019s happened, he\u2019s dug his thumbs in just there and kissed you just so, and you couldn\u2019t stop <strike>your wings unfurling if you trie</strike> from rocking your hips down against him in search of further sexual stimulation. The normal way that that happens.</p><p>He sinks his teeth into your <strike>wi</strike>\n shoulder, and probes delicately between your legs with slicked fingers,\n opening you to him like a delicate flower, before sliding home, \nsheathing himself inside you to the hilt. Oh, and you never felt so \ncomplete\u2026 You couldn\u2019t have designed your body to receive him more \nperfectly.</p><p>Not that you could design your body to do anything of \nthe sort, of course. That\u2019s not how bodies work and we all understand \nthat fact of nature. I only mean that\u2019s how magical it feels, not that \nyou might have attempted to do something like that. That would be silly.</p><p><strike>Of\n course I suppose he could have made himself to fit you, but not on the \nfirst go, he\u2019d have to have a feel for depth and\u2026 elasticity? Or\u2026 \nsomething of that nature, I mean, he\u2019d have to have a baseline, he\u2019d \nhave to know what you felt like in order to literally transform his \nprick to suit you. Anyway.</strike></p><p>He fills you and you know what\n life is for. You were put on this earth to love and be loved by him\u2013 \nand if love is a virtue, then your virtue be an endless well he might \ndraw from, but he can never relieve you of it.</p><p>He can, however, \nmove inside you, in firm and powerful thrusts. Virtue you may have an \nunending supply of, but rational thought is something you are rapidly \nlosing hold of as he gives it to you but good. He urges you along in \nyour pleasure, hissing encouragements in your ear as you moan his name, \nhelpless beneath him, <strike>once a being of duty and now a being of \nelectric pleasure, once filled with love for all things and now filled \nonly with his love</strike>.</p><p>His hands close around <strike>the patagium of each w</strike>\n your hips as he drives himself into you, as he spends himself deep \nwithin your body, in the wake of your own overwhelming pleasure. He \nkisses a line back down your spine as he withdraws from you, as you \nshiver and whine at the loss of him. You slump against the back of your \nsofa, and you think if this is what going out to the discotheque gets \nyou, you might go more often.</p>",

You\u2019ve dressed for the occasion, though not to stand out. \nYou expect you\u2019ll spend the evening holding the wall up, so to speak, \nnot being one for dancing.</p><p>Your friends are happy just to have \ngotten you in the building, honestly, so they let you try to enjoy the \nmusic from the very back. It\u2019s all very loud and very fast, but everyone\n on the dance floor seems to like it, and anyway, there are more \noffensive things in the world than enthusiastically-blared ABBA. It just\n all feels a bit of a bore\u2013 a bit of a headache.</p>[[MORE]]<p>But then, you \nhadn\u2019t expected Crowley to be there as well. He looks good, but then, he\n always does\u2013 fashionable. His trousers, despite being quite \nclose-fitting at the thigh, have just enough flare to get into this sort\n of place, his shirt collar is spread wide in a trendy sort of way\u2026 and \nhis shirt is open, just enough to show off a tantalizing glimpse of his \nchest. And the mustache! So virile\u2026</p><p>When he spots you, he heads \ntowards your little spot along the wall, all confident swagger as he \nsnakes between those boogie-ing the night away on the dance floor. He \nwalks with his hips and the rest of him just follows. When he reaches \nyou, he nudges his dark glasses down his nosebridge. golden eyes raking \nover you. You suddenly find yourself quite aware of the extra height the\n heels of his shoes give him, height he hardly needs.</p><p>\u201cCare for a \ndance?\u201d He asks, glasses back in place now\u2013 back before anyone but you \nmight have the chance of seeing his naked eyes. Seeing his true nature. \nThat\u2026 that is a select privilege, conferred upon you <strike>only because of your long asso</strike> and few others over the millennia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d You protest, though you let him take your hand in his. You haven\u2019t danced since 19<strike>03</strike>67 and it wasn\u2019t at all like this. He guides one of your hands to his hip, takes the other up. Tugs you close\u2026</p><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t it time you gave it a go?\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cIs\n this suede?\u201d You ask, nervously trying to make conversation, and rather\n fixated on the soft fabric of his trousers. He\u2019d placed your hand at \nhis hip so casually, and yet it consumes you.</p><p>\u201c<strike>An</strike>Baby,\n it\u2019s ultrasuede.\u201d He says. Not that \u2018ultrasuede\u2019 means anything to you,\n but he sounds very confident in saying it, and also his other hand is \non your hip, and that all makes it very difficult to think about these \nthings.</p><p>You\u2019re not much for dancing, but being in his arms\u2026 you \ncould be one for that. Anyway\u2026 he\u2019s not really much of a dancer himself.\n Demons aren\u2019t much better than angels, in that regard, one supposes. \nStill, you\u2019ve never known an<strike>other</strike> angel to have \nCrowley\u2019s raw sexual magnetism\u2026 something about him draws you in, \nsomething about him goes to your head like sparkling wine.</p><p>His \ncologne is unexpected, a light floral entwined with seductive vanilla, a\n contrast to the ultra-masculine appearance\u2026 and it\u2019s undercut by the \nbarest hint of skin musk,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid this really isn\u2019t my \n\u2018scene\u2019\u2026\u201d You apologize, but it comes out rather weak. He releases you, \nbut doesn\u2019t move far, doesn\u2019t stop his own gyrations, holding your focus\n with every enticing wriggle, every motion of arm, every shimmy of hip\u2026 \nand the way he flicks his tongue out towards you, the hint of something \ninhuman\u2026</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me if I want to get out of here?\u201d He winks <strike>no how would you know that?</strike> grins, reaching out and cupping your chin in his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy <strike>shop</strike> flat is just around the corner\u2026\u201d You say, emboldened. By his flirtations, by his cologne, or just by your own wicked desires\u2026</p><p>\u201cSomeone should walk you home, dark night like this.\u201d He leans in close. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s out there\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\n it would be terrible if I were to be beset upon on my walk home, by \nsome\u2026 wicked demon with designs upon my virtue.\u201d You smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\n wouldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d And he looms ever closer, so close you can \nsee those serpentine eyes behind his dark lenses. \u201cI\u2019m the only demon \nwho\u2019ll be menacing your virtue tonight.\u201d</p><p>The shiver you feel at the very thought of him\u2026 at the very thought of surrender!</p><p>\u201cTake me home?\u201d You say, and he offers you his arm.</p><p>You\u2019re\n so aware of him, on your walk home. The closeness of his body and the \nway that he moves, like having a great predator loping along at your \nside, radiating power, and there beside him, you\u2019re safe. Protected.</p><p>He\n follows you up to your flat, and no sooner do you have the door locked \nthan he\u2019s upon you, has you pressed up against it to be kissed, forked \ntongue teasing at your lips, sliding into your mouth\u2026 The most wondrous \nhaze seems to descend upon you both, making the world beyond you both \nunreal. There is only Crowley, his hands on you, his mouth on you, his \nbody pressed so close to yours.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted my virtue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\n yes\u2026\u201d He hisses, fisting a hand in your hair and baring your throat to \nhis kisses. To the tickling darting touch of his tongue, and the barest \ngraze of viperine fangs, and the rough rub of his mustache against \ntender skin. \u201cI want to relieve you of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could take some time.\u201d You warn him. \u201cI\u2019m as much virtue as you are vice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\n how much vice do you think I\u2019m made of?\u201d He asks, his breath hot \nagainst your neck. He pushes his thigh between yours, sliding up to \nnudge against <strike>the spot where you would manif</strike> your sex. \nBeing as it\u2019s always in the same place and always the same shape, and \nyou never don\u2019t have it, because that would be very odd, and you are \njust a person.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a beast.\u201d You moan, and he grins against you, and nips at you just a little.</p><p>\u201cAnd\n I\u2019m about to act like one.\u201d He promises. He moves you from the door to \nthe sofa, and bends you over the back of it, strong and sudden enough to\n make you swoon. He takes your trousers down, and <strike>you</strike> he simply miracles your shirt away, along with his own clothes.</p><p>You\n feel so eager for him, enough to make you weak in the knees, and his \ngrip on your hips is firm, holding you right where he wants you as he \ntrails wet kisses up your spine. You can feel the friction of his \nmustache, and the softness of his lips, and the wicked, clever working \nof his tongue as he works his way higher. His firm prick slides between \nyour thighs, teasingly near and not near enough to where you would most \nlike it buried, he thrusts between them as his kisses now travel from \nthe center line of your spine across your upper back. And his hands \nslide up from your hips, to travel up your back as well, like the first \nslow stroke of a sensual massage.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 oh, you know what you do to\n me\u2026\u201d You rock against him, need igniting pathways along your skin, \nbringing you to life in new and thrilling ways.</p><p>\u201cI have my \nsuspicions.\u201d He admits, and his tongue traces strange sigils across one \nshoulderblade. You can feel the building pressure and need for release <strike>there</strike>, can feel him calling forth the deepest and most intimate parts of you, as he kisses and teases <strike>around the joint</strike>, as your skin tingles the way it would before a powerful storm.</p><p>Almost before you know what\u2019s happened, he\u2019s dug his thumbs in just there and kissed you just so, and you couldn\u2019t stop <strike>your wings unfurling if you trie</strike> from rocking your hips down against him in search of further sexual stimulation. The normal way that that happens.</p><p>He sinks his teeth into your <strike>wi</strike>\n shoulder, and probes delicately between your legs with slicked fingers,\n opening you to him like a delicate flower, before sliding home, \nsheathing himself inside you to the hilt.
