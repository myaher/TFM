Other than that you&rsquo;re physically healthy.&rdquo; Fury said. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re with the Avengers? Are you here to take me to jail?&rdquo; Y/N asked. </p><p>&ldquo;That is if you don&rsquo;t accept my offer. You easily hacked into the security system and took out the guards. You successfully broke Agent Romanoff&rsquo;s nose and one of Agents Barnes ribs. I&rsquo;d like you to become an Avenger.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head. &ldquo;No way, I am not joining some sissy hero clique.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Either join our sissy clique or rot in a cell for the rest of your life. It&rsquo;ll take half a year before we let you out of the tower alone if you accept the offer. You can handle that though.&rdquo; He crossed his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine but I&rsquo;m not playing nice.&rdquo; she whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Great let&rsquo;s get you a Shield jumpsuit.&rdquo; He said motioning her to follow. </p><p>They walked down a hallway and he grabbed a suit off a hangar throwing at her. </p><p>&ldquo;Get changed in there and also,&rdquo; he put a bracelet on her wrist, &ldquo;this is to make sure you don&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N turned and walked into the small room to change. The jumpsuit looked exactly like the one Agent Romanoff tends to where, and Y/N felt self conscious in it. </p><p>&ldquo;Do they all show this much cleavage?&rdquo; she mumbled. </p><p>She walked back out and Fury led her to Conference room. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call the Avengers.&rdquo; he said said picking up the phone. </p><p>&ldquo;No winter soldier. I don&rsquo;t want to see him.&rdquo; she said looking away. </p><p>Fury nodded and held the phone to his ear. &ldquo;Come to the conference room without Barnes. Don&rsquo;t give me shit Stark hurry up.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve, Tony, Natasha, and Clint walked in the room. Natasha had a bandage on her nose and she sent a glare at Y/N. </p><p>&ldquo;What is she doing here?&rdquo; she asked sourly. </p><p>&ldquo;Meet the new Avenger.&rdquo;</p><p>A/N: Hope you enjoyed&#10084;</p></p>",

The weather outside was gray but the sun still shone through the clouds, peeking ever so slightly. It was also very windy. So windy it seemed as if the trees were dancing.\u00a0</p><p>You brought your hands together in a tight clasp. Noticing all the scars and bruises from that fight with Thanos. Oh how you thought, \u201cyou all would win.\u201d How you thought that, \u201cmaybe life might find a way?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But there was no other solution.\u00a0</p><p>You were having your dear friend Tony Stark over to keep him company. Peter Parker. The sweet, sweet boy. The smile on his face brightened up the room and made everyone happy, now he was gone, forever.\u00a0</p><p>You wanted to keep Tony company but you had to ask yourself,\u00a0\u201cwas it also you, though, that needed some human interaction as well? Maybe even more?\u201d</p><p>Just as you were pondering over the thinking of how woebegone you are, the doorbell rang.\u00a0</p><p>You walked to the door and opened it revealing a miserable Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Tony,\u201d you softly said, giving Stark a reassuring hug.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, hi y/n, hows everything?\u201d<br/></p><p>You nodded, ushering him inside the warm, gigantic house,\u00a0\u201cIts more or less the same.\u201d You sighed and went to the kitchen while Tony sat by the big window. The kitchen was connected as one big area to where Tony was at.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink,\u201d you asked fiddling with your fingers.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony, looking out the window, answered,\u00a0\u201ccoffee please.\u201d<br/></p><p>You set to work on brewing the coffee. You sat back down, in front of Tony, once you were done and the machine had to do the rest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Tony, how are you doing?\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony\u2019s attention was back to you and you noticed this was not the same man. He had more wrinkles on his face and he had deep, dark, bags under his eyes. His face was more pale, also. You knew he was not getting a lot of rest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell with what? All those that died, their deaths? Fine, I mean I don\u2019t sleep, don\u2019t eat as much, have more panic attacks and nightmares then ever before. Have to take more medication, yeah my life\u2019s great.\u201d<br/></p><p>You bit your lip and felt bad for asking him that question,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry Tony, I didn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>Tony dug his face into his hands and erupted a huge sigh,\u00a0\u201cNo y/n, I\u2019m sorry. I know you just worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, hows Pepper taking it?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOne day at a time. Same as me, and same as Happy. God do you know how terrible this feels?\u201d<br/></p><p>You looked down at your hands, not wanting to meet his eyes. You knew what he was trying to say.\u00a0\u201cNo, Tony, I probably don\u2019t. I was close to the kid, but not as close as you were to him.\u201d</p><p>You got up and went to check on the coffee, seeing that it was done you poured the liquid into a pale brown cup, handing it to Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Tony quietly thanked you and took some pills out of his pocket. He popped them in his mouth, then took a gulp of the caffeine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are those for,\u201d you pointed to the pile of different colored drugs that were lying in Tony\u2019s palm.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDepression, pain, you know, those types of things.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cTony, I want to help you. As your friend I want to help you cope through your loss.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony tapped lightly on the table,\u00a0\u201cwhat about you? Have you gotten over the deaths?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head,\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t get over, Tony, you proceed, you move forward. Those people were not just coworkers, they were our family. Peter, was family. Time is a terrible thing, but time aids you to keep going even though life may seem tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis face, that face he made when he,\u201d his lips trembled and his hands turned into fists.\u00a0\u201cWhen he disappeared. I still see him y/n. Every time I close my eyes he\u2019s there telling me he doesn\u2019t want to go and y/n, sometimes I feel like I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t keep pretending that everything\u2019s alright when its not. I\u2019m not alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts gonna be that way for a while. You can\u2019t think that way though, that you want to give up cause in the end you and me both know that\u2019s not what Peter would of wanted. And don\u2019t pretend, Tony if you need to cry, cry! If you need to scream, scream! I am here for you. Always, no matter what.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI should of protected him!\u201d<br/></p><p>His voice was like a thunder clap, it echoed and boomed through out the house.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should have saved him, I should of been the one to have died not him! Not him! He was too young y/n, he was too good for this world. Me, I have done some bad things in my life, but Peter, god I haven\u2019t said that name since that fateful day. But Peter, he was good, he was a light in this dark, twisted world,\u201d Tony sniffled, trying not to shed a tear.\u00a0\u201cI made the mistake of taking him with me.\u201d</p><p>You stood up and placed both your hands on the table.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t do that! Okay, this, his death, is not your fault. He knew what he was getting into and for that you should be proud of him. He risked his life Tony, for the world. At a young age some kids would of been selfish, but not Peter. He wanted to show you and the world that he would protect it with his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, and that\u2019s just what makes it worse. I wanted to tell him how proud I was of him. How much he meant to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d you patted Tony\u2019s shoulder. Comfort and hope would be hard to feel. You opened your mouth wanting to say more but nothing came out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d Tony gulped his sobs but nothing could stop them. His tears came out with such force,\u00a0\u201chow painful it was to tell May, about her nephew? What was I supposed to say, hey Peter tried to save humanity but he didn\u2019t, no, instead he turned into ashes. Y/n do you know how hard that was? I watched Peter die in my arms! I couldn\u2019t tell him he was going to be okay, that he would see his aunt again, nothing, it was too late! I was too late.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tears formed in your e/c eyes.\u00a0\u201cThe only thing I can do is be here for you. That\u2019s what I will always do. Be here, by your side.\u201d</p><p>You looked into Tony\u2019s cup to see his cup was empty. You picked it up and made your way to the kitchen, brewing another pot for him to drink by the wide, lonely, sad window.\u00a0</p>",

The weather outside was gray but the sun still shone through the clouds, peeking ever so slightly. It was also very windy. So windy it seemed as if the trees were dancing.\u00a0</p><p>You brought your hands together in a tight clasp. Noticing all the scars and bruises from that fight with Thanos. Oh how you thought, \u201cyou all would win.\u201d How you thought that, \u201cmaybe life might find a way?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But there was no other solution.\u00a0</p><p>You were having your dear friend Tony Stark over to keep him company. Peter Parker. The sweet, sweet boy. The smile on his face brightened up the room and made everyone happy, now he was gone, forever.\u00a0</p><p>You wanted to keep Tony company but you had to ask yourself,\u00a0\u201cwas it also you, though, that needed some human interaction as well? Maybe even more?\u201d</p><p>Just as you were pondering over the thinking of how woebegone you are, the doorbell rang.\u00a0</p><p>You walked to the door and opened it revealing a miserable Tony.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Tony,\u201d you softly said, giving Stark a reassuring hug.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, hi y/n, hows everything?\u201d<br></p><p>You nodded, ushering him inside the warm, gigantic house,\u00a0\u201cIts more or less the same.\u201d You sighed and went to the kitchen while Tony sat by the big window. The kitchen was connected as one big area to where Tony was at.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink,\u201d you asked fiddling with your fingers.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony, looking out the window, answered,\u00a0\u201ccoffee please.\u201d<br></p><p>You set to work on brewing the coffee. You sat back down, in front of Tony, once you were done and the machine had to do the rest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Tony, how are you doing?\u201d<br></p><p>Tony\u2019s attention was back to you and you noticed this was not the same man. He had more wrinkles on his face and he had deep, dark, bags under his eyes. His face was more pale, also. You knew he was not getting a lot of rest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell with what? All those that died, their deaths? Fine, I mean I don\u2019t sleep, don\u2019t eat as much, have more panic attacks and nightmares then ever before. Have to take more medication, yeah my life\u2019s great.\u201d<br></p><p>You bit your lip and felt bad for asking him that question,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry Tony, I didn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>Tony dug his face into his hands and erupted a huge sigh,\u00a0\u201cNo y/n, I\u2019m sorry. I know you just worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, hows Pepper taking it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOne day at a time. Same as me, and same as Happy. God do you know how terrible this feels?\u201d<br></p><p>You looked down at your hands, not wanting to meet his eyes. You knew what he was trying to say.\u00a0\u201cNo, Tony, I probably don\u2019t. I was close to the kid, but not as close as you were to him.\u201d</p><p>You got up and went to check on the coffee, seeing that it was done you poured the liquid into a pale brown cup, handing it to Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Tony quietly thanked you and took some pills out of his pocket. He popped them in his mouth, then took a gulp of the caffeine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are those for,\u201d you pointed to the pile of different colored drugs that were lying in Tony\u2019s palm.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDepression, pain, you know, those types of things.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTony, I want to help you. As your friend I want to help you cope through your loss.\u201d<br></p><p>Tony tapped lightly on the table,\u00a0\u201cwhat about you? Have you gotten over the deaths?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head,\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t get over, Tony, you proceed, you move forward. Those people were not just coworkers, they were our family. Peter, was family. Time is a terrible thing, but time aids you to keep going even though life may seem tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis face, that face he made when he,\u201d his lips trembled and his hands turned into fists.\u00a0\u201cWhen he disappeared. I still see him y/n. Every time I close my eyes he\u2019s there telling me he doesn\u2019t want to go and y/n, sometimes I feel like I can\u2019t do this anymore. I can\u2019t keep pretending that everything\u2019s alright when its not. I\u2019m not alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts gonna be that way for a while. You can\u2019t think that way though, that you want to give up cause in the end you and me both know that\u2019s not what Peter would of wanted. And don\u2019t pretend, Tony if you need to cry, cry! If you need to scream, scream! I am here for you. Always, no matter what.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI should of protected him!\u201d<br></p><p>His voice was like a thunder clap, it echoed and boomed through out the house.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should have saved him, I should of been the one to have died not him! Not him! He was too young y/n, he was too good for this world. Me, I have done some bad things in my life, but Peter, god I haven\u2019t said that name since that fateful day. But Peter, he was good, he was a light in this dark, twisted world,\u201d Tony sniffled, trying not to shed a tear.\u00a0\u201cI made the mistake of taking him with me.\u201d</p><p>You stood up and placed both your hands on the table.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t do that! Okay, this, his death, is not your fault. He knew what he was getting into and for that you should be proud of him. He risked his life Tony, for the world. At a young age some kids would of been selfish, but not Peter. He wanted to show you and the world that he would protect it with his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, and that\u2019s just what makes it worse. I wanted to tell him how proud I was of him. How much he meant to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d you patted Tony\u2019s shoulder. Comfort and hope would be hard to feel. You opened your mouth wanting to say more but nothing came out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d Tony gulped his sobs but nothing could stop them. His tears came out with such force,\u00a0\u201chow painful it was to tell May, about her nephew? What was I supposed to say, hey Peter tried to save humanity but he didn\u2019t, no, instead he turned into ashes. Y/n do you know how hard that was? I watched Peter die in my arms! I couldn\u2019t tell him he was going to be okay, that he would see his aunt again, nothing, it was too late! I was too late.\u201d<br></p><p>Tears formed in your e/c eyes.\u00a0\u201cThe only thing I can do is be here for you. That\u2019s what I will always do. Be here, by your side.\u201d</p><p>You looked into Tony\u2019s cup to see his cup was empty. You picked it up and made your way to the kitchen, brewing another pot for him to drink by the wide, lonely, sad window.\u00a0</p>",
