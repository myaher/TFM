Harry was born July 31, i.e., \u201cas the seventh month dies.\u201d Voldemort\u00a0\u201cmarked him as his equal\u201d by unintentionally making Harry a horcrux, reflected in Harry\u2019s lightning bolt scar.\u00a0 But what about\u00a0\u201ceither must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives\u201d?\u00a0 Clearly that\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 Voldemort is\u00a0\u201calive\u201d thanks to his horcruxes in the first four books.\u00a0 He undergoes the resurrection ceremony at the end of <i>Goblet of Fire</i>, and after that has a full corporeal form.\u00a0 So he and Harry both\u00a0\u201clive\u201d at the same time that the other\u00a0\u201csurvives,\u201d\u00a0 contrary to the prophecy. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"292\" data-orig-height=\"173\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3764748db085072fda32495399f8ef41/tumblr_inline_plvqouzsES1qfc575_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"292\" data-orig-height=\"173\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>What the prophecy does do, however, is motivate Voldemort to constantly go after Harry.\u00a0 Eventually this affords Harry the opportunity to defeat and kill him.\u00a0 So the prophecy IS accurate in identifying the person who has the power to defeat Voldemort; it just doesn\u2019t say whether Harry will succeed.\u00a0 <b>It does not reveal the ending.</b> \u00a0</p><p>So is Maggy the Frog\u2019s prophecy for Cersei true?\u00a0 Or is it misleading?\u00a0 We know the beginning was true&ndash;Cersei became queen and had three children.\u00a0 What about this part, about Cersei\u2019s downfall, which hasn\u2019t happened yet in either book or show?</p><blockquote><p>Queen you shall be&hellip; until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear<br/></p></blockquote><p>Cersei believed this part referred to Margaery, and it motivated her to go after her daughter-in-law.\u00a0 But Cersei was wrong: Margaery is dead, and Cersei is now queen in her own right (on the show).\u00a0 So presumably the prophecy is still relevant.</p><p>Who could be the\u00a0\u201cyounger and more beautiful\u201d threat to Cersei?\u00a0 The obvious answer is Daenerys, since power is the only thing Cersei holds dear now.\u00a0 (My Braime heart wants to say it could be Brienne, but even though she\u2019s younger than Cersei it would be hard to argue she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cmore beautiful,\u201d and Cersei hasn\u2019t held Jaime dear for a long time.\u00a0 She has nothing but contempt for him.)</p><p>The prophecy in the book has another part, not included on the show.\u00a0 Cersei explains to Taena why Tyrion frightens her:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe is going to kill me. It was foreseen when I was ten&hellip;.Tyrion is the <i>valonqar</i>,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cDo you use that word on Myr? It\u2019s High Valyrian; it means <i>little brother.\u201d</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>I can certainly see a scenario where Tyrion kills Cersei, but the wording of this part of the prophecy leaves lots of wiggle room for it to be someone else.\u00a0 Members of religious orders are often referred to as\u00a0\u201cbrothers\u201d&ndash;perhaps a Sparrow will eliminate Cersei.\u00a0 Or since Cersei was born first and Jaime is the younger brother, HE will do the deed.\u00a0 Lots of possibilities. \u00a0</p><p>So is the prophecy fully <b>true</b>?\u00a0 Will Daenerys\u00a0\u201ccast down\u201d Cersei and will Tyrion kill her?\u00a0 Or is it <b>misleading</b>, and the ending will be different?\u00a0 Who knows, but my money is on the prophecy being misleading and the ending unpredictable.</p><p>Also curious is that the prophecy is about Cersei&ndash;and no one thinks Cersei is the main protagonist of ASOIAF.\u00a0 She is not Oedipus, or Macbeth, or Manxmouse, or Harry Potter.\u00a0 The prophecy certainly motivates Cersei\u2019s behavior, but it may not be as central to the story as those other prophecies. \u00a0</p>",

Harry was born July 31, i.e., &ldquo;as the seventh month dies.&rdquo; Voldemort&nbsp;&ldquo;marked him as his equal&rdquo; by unintentionally making Harry a horcrux, reflected in Harry&rsquo;s lightning bolt scar.&nbsp; But what about&nbsp;&ldquo;either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives&rdquo;?&nbsp; Clearly that&rsquo;s wrong.&nbsp; Voldemort is&nbsp;&ldquo;alive&rdquo; thanks to his horcruxes in the first four books.&nbsp; He undergoes the resurrection ceremony at the end of <i>Goblet of Fire</i>, and after that has a full corporeal form.&nbsp; So he and Harry both&nbsp;&ldquo;live&rdquo; at the same time that the other&nbsp;&ldquo;survives,&rdquo;&nbsp; contrary to the prophecy. &nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3764748db085072fda32495399f8ef41/tumblr_inline_plvqouzsES1qfc575_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br /></p><p>What the prophecy does do, however, is motivate Voldemort to constantly go after Harry.&nbsp; Eventually this affords Harry the opportunity to defeat and kill him.&nbsp; So the prophecy IS accurate in identifying the person who has the power to defeat Voldemort; it just doesn&rsquo;t say whether Harry will succeed.&nbsp; <b>It does not reveal the ending.</b> &nbsp;</p><p>So is Maggy the Frog&rsquo;s prophecy for Cersei true?&nbsp; Or is it misleading?&nbsp; We know the beginning was true&ndash;Cersei became queen and had three children.&nbsp; What about this part, about Cersei&rsquo;s downfall, which hasn&rsquo;t happened yet in either book or show?</p><blockquote><p>Queen you shall be&hellip; until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear<br /></p></blockquote><p>Cersei believed this part referred to Margaery, and it motivated her to go after her daughter-in-law.&nbsp; But Cersei was wrong: Margaery is dead, and Cersei is now queen in her own right (on the show).&nbsp; So presumably the prophecy is still relevant.</p><p>Who could be the&nbsp;&ldquo;younger and more beautiful&rdquo; threat to Cersei?&nbsp; The obvious answer is Daenerys, since power is the only thing Cersei holds dear now.&nbsp; (My Braime heart wants to say it could be Brienne, but even though she&rsquo;s younger than Cersei it would be hard to argue she&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;more beautiful,&rdquo; and Cersei hasn&rsquo;t held Jaime dear for a long time.&nbsp; She has nothing but contempt for him.)</p><p>The prophecy in the book has another part, not included on the show.&nbsp; Cersei explains to Taena why Tyrion frightens her:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He is going to kill me. It was foreseen when I was ten&hellip;.Tyrion is the <i>valonqar</i>,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you use that word on Myr? It&rsquo;s High Valyrian; it means <i>little brother.&rdquo;</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>I can certainly see a scenario where Tyrion kills Cersei, but the wording of this part of the prophecy leaves lots of wiggle room for it to be someone else.&nbsp; Members of religious orders are often referred to as&nbsp;&ldquo;brothers&rdquo;&ndash;perhaps a Sparrow will eliminate Cersei.&nbsp; Or since Cersei was born first and Jaime is the younger brother, HE will do the deed.&nbsp; Lots of possibilities. &nbsp;</p><p>So is the prophecy fully <b>true</b>?&nbsp; Will Daenerys&nbsp;&ldquo;cast down&rdquo; Cersei and will Tyrion kill her?&nbsp; Or is it <b>misleading</b>, and the ending will be different?&nbsp; Who knows, but my money is on the prophecy being misleading and the ending unpredictable.</p><p>Also curious is that the prophecy is about Cersei&ndash;and no one thinks Cersei is the main protagonist of ASOIAF.&nbsp; She is not Oedipus, or Macbeth, or Manxmouse, or Harry Potter.&nbsp; The prophecy certainly motivates Cersei&rsquo;s behavior, but it may not be as central to the story as those other prophecies. &nbsp;</p>",
