What brings you here?\u201d He asked while giving a kiss on both of your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWell, uhm\u2026 paperwork\u2026 I can&rsquo;t talk about it actually,\u201d you admitted. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can&rsquo;t talk about it,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWait, maybe we can&rsquo;t talk about the same thing. Because\u2026 you know\u2026 I will be\u2026 a\u2026 \u201c</p><p>\u201cJudge,\u201d you were at the same time.</p><p>\u201cOooohhh,\u201d you covered your mouth with your hand and started freaking out in a good way.</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;re both going to be judges,\u201d Louis said with the brightest smile. \u201cI can&rsquo;t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho&rsquo;s the fourth by the way? Simon, you and I and\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard rumors that it might be Robbie Williams but I&rsquo;m not sure yet. You&rsquo;re called into a meeting tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;ll find out tomorrow then. I gotta go now, I&rsquo;m late\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, go!\u201d You gave him a kiss and you left after he paced into the building.</p><p>You got home but you didn&rsquo;t want to tell Harry you met Louis, knowing that tomorrow it will be official and you can tell him without feeling guilty.</p><p>In a few weeks, everything was settled and Harry was as excited as you for this whole. You felt your relationship getting stronger day by day. You were happy that the loss didn\u2019t tear you apart but brought you closer. The public was surprised that both you and Louis are gonna be judges in the X-Factor where Louis and your husband started. It was exciting for you too. Even though when you were in music school you tutored some other students, but you never had experience in mentoring other singers. And you haven\u2019t been in any talent shows, you were lucky that someone from Columbia Records heard you playing and singing live in a club years ago. You followed the program and that was the only thing you experienced about the show.</p><p>On the other hand, you kept living a healthy life and worked out four times a week with Harry. You also went running twice a week which was always followed by paps, so you were on the news a lot. But people, in general, were happy about seeing you two together sharing activities.</p><p>You could be intimate with Harry again. It was a relief after a short time of getting along with your feelings.</p><p>A few days before the first day of auditions you had interviews and photo shoots too for the promo of the show. On the 18th of July, on the first audition day, Harry was there with you. You were nervous. You got there in the early morning. Before everything started you needed to stop.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, pet?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just need the toilet,\u201d you said and he went with you.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in,\u201d you told him.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019ll stay close,\u201d he said. After what you\u2019ve gone through he didn\u2019t want to leave you alone especially when you felt sick. You drank some water and washed your face with cold water. It made you feel a bit better.</p><p>They chose a dress for you and you got your makeup done. Until that Harry was with Louis catching up on things. When you walked into the room they were in, Harry\u2019s eyes stopped at you and he dropped his jaws.</p><p>\u201cGosh! You look amazing!\u201d he said and stood up to kiss you.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d you smiled. \u201cBut don\u2019t ruin my lipstick, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cy/n, you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d Louis said.</p><p>\u201cI heard that\u201d you heard a familiar voice. You turned around to see Eleanor.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl!\u201d you said and hugged her.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding, you really are beautiful\u201d she smiled at you.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going, fellow judges\u201d Simon shouted into the room. The others stayed back and you went to sit in your chair that had your name on it. Luckily the nerves went away after a few performances and you started enjoying this whole thing. You had some breaks and Harry always went out to you to check if you\u2019re alright. It always made the audience scream a bit. So in the third break that day you wanted to show them who\u2019s Mrs. Styles. When Harry walked in, all the girls screamed in the audience. You didn\u2019t stand up and turned your chair so people saw you from the profile. Harry leaned down to you.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my baby?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d you smiled. \u201cHarry\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmh\u201d you didn\u2019t say anything but kissed him. You heard the audience go crazy and you knew there was at least one video about your kiss.</p><p>\u201cStop the PDA, please\u201d Louis whined next to you with Harry\u2019s bum in his face.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Lou,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201c15 seconds before starting again\u201d you heard.</p><p>\u201cKeep my girl safe here,\u201d Harry told Louis.</p><p>\u201cYou too with my girl\u201d he shouted after him.</p><p>There were nine days of auditions and it was a bit tiring, but an amazing experience, you couldn\u2019t wait to find out which group you\u2019re gonna get. The performers were great and you had some favorites. You thought you\u2019d be happy with any group.</p><p>At the end of deliberation day, you found out your group. As they filmed Dermot walked with you.</p><p>\u201cWhich group you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have favorites in all groups, but &hellip;the girls,\u201d you said excitedly. Then there was a big door that was opened to you. And you found not others but the girls there. They screamed, you screamed and they all gathered around you in a big hug. You went and hugged everyone in there.</p><p>Quickly after that, the six-chair challenge was filmed in three days. \u00a0It was really hard to choose only six from those incredible girls, but Harry and the basically everyone else helped you through it. You\u2019ve got some free time after that. The Judges\u2019 House was set to be filmed in September so you had a month until you have to work again.</p><p>Two weeks later you and Harry were at home.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d you sat down next to him on the couch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta tell you something.\u201d He looked so worried.</p><p>\u201cI missed my period and I think we should go to the doctor to see if everything\u2019s alright down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You wanna go now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine if we go tomorrow or some day this week.\u201d you didn\u2019t want to upset him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I call him now and I set an appointment for tomorrow,\u201d he said and already dialed the number.</p><p>The next day you sat in the waiting room in the evening chatting quietly with Harry.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles\u201d you heard after the door open. After he checked you, he put down his glasses and looked at both of you.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles, your ovaries and your uterus as a whole are fine. There\u2019s no damage I can see. But I can see something\u201d it seemed o you that he\u2019s talking even slower than Harry. \u201cI say something because I\u2019m not completely sure and I don\u2019t want to make you too excited. If I\u2019m right, you\u2019re pregnant again\u201d you gasped and Harry tightened the grip around you. \u201cBut as I say I don\u2019t want to make you too excited. We need to check about a week later to be sure. If I\u2019m right you\u2019re about 3 or 4 weeks pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! I\u2019d\u00a0be happy if I was\u201d you started crying and Harry pulled you into a hug.</p><p>That one week was so long and you could barely concentrate on anything else. But on that Friday afternoon, you went to see the doctor again. He did the same things as last time and he couldn\u2019t hide his smile when he told you.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles, you are indeed pregnant. Congratulations!\u201d you started crying just like Harry. When you calmed down a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be careful now, no lifting, no heavy task, and instead of workout you should do only pregnancy safe exercises. I know you\u2019re already conscious about these things\u2026\u201d he told some useful things and recommended clubs and websites. But he told something else before you left.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you something interesting. There is a term used for those babies who are born after a miscarriage. I, myself was born after my mother lost her baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the term?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cA rainbow baby.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"367\" data-orig-width=\"571\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/94f8319432b24d7b59f048431e580942/tumblr_inline_plcar124Le1vqssia_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"367\" data-orig-width=\"571\"/></figure><p>Here\u2019s a cute Louis ^</p>",

So in the third break that day you wanted to show them who\u2019s Mrs. Styles. When Harry walked in, all the girls screamed in the audience.

The performers were great and you had some favorites. You thought you\u2019d be happy with any group.</p><p>At the end of deliberation day, you found out your group.

You went and hugged everyone in there.</p><p>Quickly after that, the six-chair challenge was filmed in three days. \u00a0It was really hard to choose only six from those incredible girls, but Harry and the basically everyone else helped you through it. You\u2019ve got some free time after that. The Judges\u2019 House was set to be filmed in September so you had a month until you have to work again.</p><p>Two weeks later you and Harry were at home.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d you sat down next to him on the couch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he looked at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta tell you something.\u201d He looked so worried.</p><p>\u201cI missed my period and I think we should go to the doctor to see if everything\u2019s alright down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.

After he checked you, he put down his glasses and looked at both of you.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Styles, your ovaries and your uterus as a whole are fine. There\u2019s no damage I can see. But I can see something\u201d it seemed o you that he\u2019s talking even slower than Harry. \u201cI say something because I\u2019m not completely sure and I don\u2019t want to make you too excited. If I\u2019m right, you\u2019re pregnant again\u201d you gasped and Harry tightened the grip around you. \u201cBut as I say I don\u2019t want to make you too excited. We need to check about a week later to be sure. If I\u2019m right you\u2019re about 3 or 4 weeks pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!

As they filmed Dermot walked with you.</p><p>&ldquo;Which group you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have favorites in all groups, but &hellip;the girls,&rdquo; you said excitedly. Then there was a big door that was opened to you. And you found not others but the girls there. They screamed, you screamed and they all gathered around you in a big hug. You went and hugged everyone in there.</p><p>Quickly after that, the six-chair challenge was filmed in three days. &nbsp;It was really hard to choose only six from those incredible girls, but Harry and the basically everyone else helped you through it. You&rsquo;ve got some free time after that. The Judges&rsquo; House was set to be filmed in September so you had a month until you have to work again.</p><p>Two weeks later you and Harry were at home.</p><p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; you sat down next to him on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he looked at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotta tell you something.&rdquo; He looked so worried.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed my period and I think we should go to the doctor to see if everything&rsquo;s alright down there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. You wanna go now?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine if we go tomorrow or some day this week.&rdquo; you didn&rsquo;t want to upset him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I call him now and I set an appointment for tomorrow,&rdquo; he said and already dialed the number.</p><p>The next day you sat in the waiting room in the evening chatting quietly with Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Styles&rdquo; you heard after the door open. After he checked you, he put down his glasses and looked at both of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Styles, your ovaries and your uterus as a whole are fine. There&rsquo;s no damage I can see. But I can see something&rdquo; it seemed o you that he&rsquo;s talking even slower than Harry. &ldquo;I say something because I&rsquo;m not completely sure and I don&rsquo;t want to make you too excited. If I&rsquo;m right, you&rsquo;re pregnant again&rdquo; you gasped and Harry tightened the grip around you. &ldquo;But as I say I don&rsquo;t want to make you too excited. We need to check about a week later to be sure. If I&rsquo;m right you&rsquo;re about 3 or 4 weeks pregnant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God! I&rsquo;d&nbsp;be happy if I was&rdquo; you started crying and Harry pulled you into a hug.</p><p>That one week was so long and you could barely concentrate on anything else. But on that Friday afternoon, you went to see the doctor again. He did the same things as last time and he couldn&rsquo;t hide his smile when he told you.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Styles, you are indeed pregnant. Congratulations!&rdquo; you started crying just like Harry. When you calmed down a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to be careful now, no lifting, no heavy task, and instead of workout you should do only pregnancy safe exercises. I know you&rsquo;re already conscious about these things&hellip;&rdquo; he told some useful things and recommended clubs and websites. But he told something else before you left.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something interesting. There is a term used for those babies who are born after a miscarriage. I, myself was born after my mother lost her baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the term?&rdquo; Harry asked.</p><p>&ldquo;A rainbow baby.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/94f8319432b24d7b59f048431e580942/tumblr_inline_plcar124Le1vqssia_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Here&rsquo;s a cute Louis ^</p>",

You loved this playful side of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI will. Anyway , so yes. That is true. <i>But</i>\u00a0it wasn\u2019t planned like that originally. I was invited to a friend\u2019s birthday party. And you know things got crazy. And this friend had a friend who brought a family member and their birthday was coming up as well. They were telling me they were a big fan and if I can give them an early birthday present. I assumed it was like a video or picture or whatever. No , they wanted a strip tease. I said NO at first. They were fine with it. Just ,\u201d you let out a sigh ,\u00a0\u201c it was the tequila shots that got me man. I took too much. A very sultry song came on and it was like I floated to this person and it just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWow. How much did you get paid?\u201d James leans in to the table , curious to hear your answer.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI had bills thrown at me.\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t keep the money , I actually gave tipped the guys that were working that night instead.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd did you ever see this guy again?\u201d Harry asks. You can see the hint of jealousy in his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0You smiled , knowing what he was doing.\u00a0\u201cI never saw <i>her</i> again. Moving on. Harry I will give you , the uhm ,\u00a0 salmon smoothie,\u201d you turned the table so it landed in front of him ,\u00a0\u201cand your question is,\u201d you pulled out the card ,\u00a0\u201cOh this one is easy. In your first album , Carolina was written about a girl, most of your songs were written from personal experiences. Is your second album any different?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d James commented.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a great one.\u201d You agreed.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cErm ,\u201d Harry relaxes in his seat ,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s a little bit of both. Personal and just whatever comes to mind. I was thinking about putting some songs that didn\u2019t make it in to the first album in to the second one , but it\u2019s still a work in progress. You\u2019re just gonna have to wait until it\u2019s finished to find out.\u201d He smirks.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoes that include the studio versions of Medicine and Anna?\u201d You joke.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNext question.\u201d He chuckles.\u00a0\u201cJames I give you cod sperm and your question is.\u201d James turns the table for Harry as he grabs the card. He jokingly clears his throat ,\u00a0\u201cWho was your least favorite member of One Direction?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cOooooo.\u201d you cheer along with the audience.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can say me , I won\u2019t get mad.\u201d Harry jokes. James looks down at the cod sperm then up at the audience.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t have a least favorite member of One Direction.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cBullshit.\u201d You and Harry call out in unison. James laughs at the two of you.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll give it you. But it\u2019s not over. I can see it in your eyes. You wanna say Harry Styles.\u201d You joke.\u00a0\u201cMy turn then. What are you giving me?\u201d You watch as James turns the table without saying a word.\u00a0\u201cOh no! The bird saliva?!\u201d You groan.\u00a0\u201cEven the sight of it just -\u201d you gag.<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cY/N your last question is. Have you ever kept a secret from Harry ? and What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You let out a deep breath and watch the audiences reaction.

You loved this playful side of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI will. Anyway , so yes. That is true. <i>But</i>\u00a0it wasn\u2019t planned like that originally. I was invited to a friend\u2019s birthday party. And you know things got crazy. And this friend had a friend who brought a family member and their birthday was coming up as well. They were telling me they were a big fan and if I can give them an early birthday present. I assumed it was like a video or picture or whatever. No , they wanted a strip tease. I said NO at first. They were fine with it. Just ,\u201d you let out a sigh ,\u00a0\u201c it was the tequila shots that got me man. I took too much. A very sultry song came on and it was like I floated to this person and it just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWow. How much did you get paid?\u201d James leans in to the table , curious to hear your answer.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI had bills thrown at me.\u201d You laughed.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t keep the money , I actually gave tipped the guys that were working that night instead.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd did you ever see this guy again?\u201d Harry asks. You can see the hint of jealousy in his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0You smiled , knowing what he was doing.\u00a0\u201cI never saw <i>her</i> again. Moving on. Harry I will give you , the uhm ,\u00a0 salmon smoothie,\u201d you turned the table so it landed in front of him ,\u00a0\u201cand your question is,\u201d you pulled out the card ,\u00a0\u201cOh this one is easy. In your first album , Carolina was written about a girl, most of your songs were written from personal experiences. Is your second album any different?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d James commented.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a great one.\u201d You agreed.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cErm ,\u201d Harry relaxes in his seat ,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s a little bit of both. Personal and just whatever comes to mind. I was thinking about putting some songs that didn\u2019t make it in to the first album in to the second one , but it\u2019s still a work in progress. You\u2019re just gonna have to wait until it\u2019s finished to find out.\u201d He smirks.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoes that include the studio versions of Medicine and Anna?\u201d You joke.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNext question.\u201d He chuckles.\u00a0\u201cJames I give you cod sperm and your question is.\u201d James turns the table for Harry as he grabs the card. He jokingly clears his throat ,\u00a0\u201cWho was your least favorite member of One Direction?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cOooooo.\u201d you cheer along with the audience.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can say me , I won\u2019t get mad.\u201d Harry jokes. James looks down at the cod sperm then up at the audience.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t have a least favorite member of One Direction.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cBullshit.\u201d You and Harry call out in unison. James laughs at the two of you.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll give it you. But it\u2019s not over. I can see it in your eyes. You wanna say Harry Styles.\u201d You joke.\u00a0\u201cMy turn then. What are you giving me?\u201d You watch as James turns the table without saying a word.\u00a0\u201cOh no! The bird saliva?!\u201d You groan.\u00a0\u201cEven the sight of it just -\u201d you gag.<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cY/N your last question is.

I was invited to a friend\u2019s birthday party. And you know things got crazy. And this friend had a friend who brought a family member and their birthday was coming up as well. They were telling me they were a big fan and if I can give them an early birthday present. I assumed it was like a video or picture or whatever. No , they wanted a strip tease. I said NO at first. They were fine with it. Just ,\u201d you let out a sigh ,\u00a0\u201c it was the tequila shots that got me man. I took too much.

You can see the hint of jealousy in his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0You smiled , knowing what he was doing.\u00a0\u201cI never saw <i>her</i> again. Moving on. Harry I will give you , the uhm ,\u00a0 salmon smoothie,\u201d you turned the table so it landed in front of him ,\u00a0\u201cand your question is,\u201d you pulled out the card ,\u00a0\u201cOh this one is easy.

Is your second album any different?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d James commented.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a great one.\u201d You agreed.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cErm ,\u201d Harry relaxes in his seat ,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s a little bit of both. Personal and just whatever comes to mind. I was thinking about putting some songs that didn\u2019t make it in to the first album in to the second one , but it\u2019s still a work in progress. You\u2019re just gonna have to wait until it\u2019s finished to find out.\u201d He smirks.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDoes that include the studio versions of Medicine and Anna?\u201d You joke.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNext question.\u201d He chuckles.\u00a0\u201cJames I give you cod sperm and your question is.\u201d James turns the table for Harry as he grabs the card.

James looks down at the cod sperm then up at the audience.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t have a least favorite member of One Direction.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cBullshit.\u201d You and Harry call out in unison. James laughs at the two of you.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll give it you. But it\u2019s not over. I can see it in your eyes. You wanna say Harry Styles.\u201d You joke.\u00a0\u201cMy turn then. What are you giving me?\u201d You watch as James turns the table without saying a word.\u00a0\u201cOh no!

I didn\u2019t want you to find out like this.\u201d You let out a shaky nervous breath.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been three months and I wanted to tell you as soon as it happened but I didn\u2019t know how.\u201d The whole room got quiet and you can feel the tension begin to build. James was watching you intently his hand slowly rising to his mouth as you spoke.\u00a0\u201cBut here it goes,\u201d the tears began to well up in your eyes ,\u00a0\u201cHarry I\u2019m pregnant!\u201d You announce , cheerily.</p><p>\u00a0You can see him let out a sigh of relief and then he jumps out of his chair. The audience is cheering so loud you can barely hear what he\u2019s saying , but he looked ecstatic. He embraced you in a tight hug and began peppering kisses all over your face.\u00a0\u201cYou scared me fo\u2019 a minute there.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry.
