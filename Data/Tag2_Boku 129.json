Satou shoved an\nentire cake into Deku\u2019s mouth. Ochako realized she wanted to save people in addition to earning money to ease her parents\u2019 poverty. Sero and Kirishima showered Kirishima with affectionate concern.\nBakugou quietly chilled on the couch pretending not to be worried.\nKaminari slid over and called him \u201cKacchan\u201d like the homeboy he is. It was all\namazing. The next morning, Bakugou and Todoroki headed off to their provisional\nlicense course. All Might and Present Mic showed up to chaperone them, and we learned from All Might that Kurogiri was indeed captured by Gran Torino and Naomasa, but Giganto escaped after dealing some heavy damage. The group arrived\nat the training course location, and everyone\u2019s windy fave Yoarashi greeted them along with Camie (the real one!) and fucking Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs\n(Seiji). Also Endeavor was there to watch. And he\u2019s going to have a private\nchat with All Might. Should be lots of fun, this.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Our best boys Bakugou, Shouto and Inasa (and Camie) begin the day\u2019s training course. Endeavor cheers Shouto on from the stands and everyone is like\u00a0\u201c&hellip;\u201d but then they notice All Might sitting next to him and they\u2019re like\u00a0\u201cOH FUCK YEAH, ALL MIGHT.\u201d Gang Orca walks out onto the floor, compares all of the kids to fish feces, and fucking yeets my three faves across the room. He then informs them that they lack heart, and thus he is assigning them a special trial. Enter a group of about 25 screaming elementary schoolers, plus their harried teacher who is constantly on the verge of tears. Baku, Shouto, Camie and Inasa are told that they\u2019ll be in charge of them, and that to pass this test they\u2019ll need to cooperate and move the children\u2019s hearts. This is, of course, a recipe for perfect chaos, and to make things even more entertaining, Mic decides to do play-by-play commentary.

Satou shoved an\nentire cake into Deku\u2019s mouth. Ochako realized she wanted to save people in addition to earning money to ease her parents\u2019 poverty. Sero and Kirishima showered Kirishima with affectionate concern.\nBakugou quietly chilled on the couch pretending not to be worried.\nKaminari slid over and called him \u201cKacchan\u201d like the homeboy he is. It was all\namazing. The next morning, Bakugou and Todoroki headed off to their provisional\nlicense course. All Might and Present Mic showed up to chaperone them, and we learned from All Might that Kurogiri was indeed captured by Gran Torino and Naomasa, but Giganto escaped after dealing some heavy damage. The group arrived\nat the training course location, and everyone\u2019s windy fave Yoarashi greeted them along with Camie (the real one!) and fucking Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs\n(Seiji). Also Endeavor was there to watch. And he\u2019s going to have a private\nchat with All Might. Should be lots of fun, this.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Our best boys Bakugou, Shouto and Inasa (and Camie) begin the day\u2019s training course. Endeavor cheers Shouto on from the stands and everyone is like\u00a0\u201c\u2026\u201d but then they notice All Might sitting next to him and they\u2019re like\u00a0\u201cOH FUCK YEAH, ALL MIGHT.\u201d Gang Orca walks out onto the floor, compares all of the kids to fish feces, and fucking yeets my three faves across the room. He then informs them that they lack heart, and thus he is assigning them a special trial. Enter a group of about 25 screaming elementary schoolers, plus their harried teacher who is constantly on the verge of tears. Baku, Shouto, Camie and Inasa are told that they\u2019ll be in charge of them, and that to pass this test they\u2019ll need to cooperate and move the children\u2019s hearts. This is, of course, a recipe for perfect chaos, and to make things even more entertaining, Mic decides to do play-by-play commentary. Meanwhile, a surprisingly subdued Endeavor asks All Might exactly what it means to be\u00a0\u201cthe Symbol of Peace.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

Satou shoved an\nentire cake into Deku&rsquo;s mouth. Ochako realized she wanted to save people in addition to earning money to ease her parents&rsquo; poverty. Sero and Kirishima showered Kirishima with affectionate concern.\nBakugou quietly chilled on the couch pretending not to be worried.\nKaminari slid over and called him &ldquo;Kacchan&rdquo; like the homeboy he is. It was all\namazing. The next morning, Bakugou and Todoroki headed off to their provisional\nlicense course. All Might and Present Mic showed up to chaperone them, and we learned from All Might that Kurogiri was indeed captured by Gran Torino and Naomasa, but Giganto escaped after dealing some heavy damage. The group arrived\nat the training course location, and everyone&rsquo;s windy fave Yoarashi greeted them along with Camie (the real one!) and fucking Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs\n(Seiji). Also Endeavor was there to watch. And he&rsquo;s going to have a private\nchat with All Might.

He then informs them that they lack heart, and thus he is assigning them a special trial. Enter a group of about 25 screaming elementary schoolers, plus their harried teacher who is constantly on the verge of tears. Baku, Shouto, Camie and Inasa are told that they&rsquo;ll be in charge of them, and that to pass this test they&rsquo;ll need to cooperate and move the children&rsquo;s hearts. This is, of course, a recipe for perfect chaos, and to make things even more entertaining, Mic decides to do play-by-play commentary. Meanwhile, a surprisingly subdued Endeavor asks All Might exactly what it means to be&nbsp;&ldquo;the Symbol of Peace.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

Sero and Kirishima showered Kirishima with affectionate concern.\nBakugou quietly chilled on the couch pretending not to be worried.\nKaminari slid over and called him &ldquo;Kacchan&rdquo; like the homeboy he is. It was all\namazing. The next morning, Bakugou and Todoroki headed off to their provisional\nlicense course. All Might and Present Mic showed up to chaperone them, and we learned from All Might that Kurogiri was indeed captured by Gran Torino and Naomasa, but Giganto escaped after dealing some heavy damage.

He then informs them that they lack heart, and thus he is assigning them a special trial.

Baku, Shouto, Camie and Inasa are told that they&rsquo;ll be in charge of them, and that to pass this test they&rsquo;ll need to cooperate and move the children&rsquo;s hearts. This is, of course, a recipe for perfect chaos, and to make things even more entertaining, Mic decides to do play-by-play commentary.

It\u2019s like god had planned this. Even if he had changed and become a better, <i>softer,</i> person, it looked like god was still trying to get him back for all his shitty teenage years. </p><p>His morning started off pretty normal, or as normal as it could get.</p><p>Waking up at the crack of dawn, freshening up and doing a light workout before preparing breakfast for him and the other occupant in the household. Since he had the day off he had more time to himself, enjoying his leisure time while it lasted. </p><p>As he watched the steadily rising sun from the window, fresh cup of coffee in hand, a deafening high-pitched screech ripped through tranquil atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!!!\u201d his 13 year old daughter screamed from the second floor.</p><p>He set his mug down with a sigh, and quickly made his way to attend to his little girl. He found her standing in the private bathroom that connected to her bedroom, quivering and tears with in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Kayu what\u2019s wrong?\u201d walking up to his daughter and holding her by the shoulders getting her to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cI-I.. I think I started my period\u2026\u201d she quietly confessed. \u201cT-there was blood all over my underwear and shorts when I woke up, a-and I think there\u2019s some on the sheets\u2026I don\u2019t know what to do daddy, help\u2026 \u201d she cried.</p><p>Bakugou froze. The only time he had to deal with periods was the rare occasions when your cramps were too much for you to handle and he had to go retrieve your needed cravings and supply of pads from the store himself. Other than that he only knew the basic knowledge from health class.</p><p>\u201cO-ok\u2026 well, go freshen up and I\u2019ll go change your sheets. Let me know when you\u2019re done and I\u2019ll get you a pad I-I guess\u2026\u201d she nodded and they separated to their duties. Bakugou quickly tore the stained sheets off his daughters mattress and threw them in the washer. Then he dashed to your shared bathroom in search for pads. This was going to be a long day.</p><p><i>\u2018Where is this shit!?\u2019</i> he internally cursed as he rummaged through the cabinets and drawers, not caring of the mess he was leaving scattered on the floor. It\u2019s like you were reading his mind when his phone buzzed in his pocket, displaying his wife\u2019s blinding smile in the contact photo.</p><p><i>\u201cHey Katsuki, how are you doing?\u201d</i> you greeted with your usual peppy tone.</p><p>Bakugou groaned, \u201cPretty shitty\u2026 Kayu just got her period\u2026\u201d</p><p>He heard you gasp on the other line, <i>\u201cReally?!
