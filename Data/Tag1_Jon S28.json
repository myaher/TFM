        "question": "Young Griff Anon here :) Thank you for that answer. So, there's a popular theory that after Dany accidentally sets of the wildfire stores in KL and the city collapses, it sends her on a redemptive path and she volunteers here army and dragons to the fight against The Others. I was just thinking about you saying that Dany will die a villain and wanted to know your thoughts on this. You think Jon will kill Dany in the books too?",
        "answer": "<p>I think D&amp;D took a lot of liberties with GRRM\u2019s ending, but that feels just too big a detail for them to have changed. Especially because they never seemed interested in telling the story of how Jon comes to kill Daenerys; maybe I\u2019m reading too much into things, but it felt like two people dragging their feet because they were forced into writing something they didn\u2019t really want to. I don\u2019t think D&amp;D ever cared for Daenerys dark turn, and they certainly didn\u2019t care about Jon\u2019s characterization. I don\u2019t think they would have come up with that ending on their own.</p><p>And it\u2019s a classic GRRM twist, where once you know, suddenly there\u2019s this\u00a0\u201coh!\u201d moment where all the foreshadowing and character development clicks into place. So much of the books have been dedicated to kinslaying; what that means, how society views it, how a kinslayer is cursed, etc. I always thought that was foreshadowing for Tyrion\u2019s killing of Tywin, and that all the talk of it afterward was a reminder because Tyrion\u2019s fate was so grim. But in hindsight, it makes so much sense that GRRM is building to a huge plot climax where Jon has to kill Daenerys, his aunt and relative many times over (gotta love incest), making him a kinslayer.\u00a0</p><p>And in hindsight, there is so much talk in Jon\u2019s chapters alone of kinslaying. First in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, when he pictures Benjen lying dead in the snow and then feels ashamed. And again in <i>A Clash of Kings</i>, when Ygritte tells him the story of Bael the Bard, and how the King in the North killed the King Beyond the Wall. And it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve read Jon\u2019s <i>A Storm of Swords </i>chapters, so I can\u2019t remember when these dreams start but he definitely has dreams of killing Robb in <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>. He was always scared that he would one day turn on Robb and try to take Winterfell; that foreshadowing works doubly for his relationship to Daenerys, since he would be revealed to be 1) a better heir 2) older than she is. Jon\u2019s talk with Tyrion from the first book, about how Tyrion dreamt of killing his family and how Jon gets so upset, also seems very important now.</p><p>Jon\u2019s nightmares were a look into the part of himself he feared, that his\u00a0\u201cbastard\u201d nature would take over and he would become something dark and dishonorable by killing Robb to take Winterfell. The twist is that Jon killing Daenerys is none of those things, and will most likely be a showing of how strong his moral character is; that he is willing to defile his name as a kinslayer and give up his future, all to save the realm/his family from Daenerys.\u00a0</p>",

The summer air was slightly cold as the sun faded from the sky. Winter was coming, that was certain. The sky would soon stay grey and the long night would fall over the whole of Westeros. For the Stark words do come true, as they always do.<br/></p><p>\tThe Starks were busy preparing for the coming winter, training their children to become fearsome, yet honorable, warriors. Even Arya showed promise with a bow. Jon had been aiding in her training away from Lady Catelyn\u2019s eyes. It was for the best, safe for the both of them. Arya and Jon got on so well, you could remember once the young girl asked if she was a bastard like her half-brother. You took the opportunity to educate her. </p><p>\t\u201cNo, little one. You are trueborn, but Jon being a bastard doesn\u2019t make him any less honorable.\u201d Your words gave Arya a calm feeling, while it gave Jon, who was behind the little wolf\u2019s door, a large smile. When you had entered the hall, Jon grabbed your hand. He had pulled you close to him, leaning against the wall away from Arya\u2019s door. </p><p>\t\u201cI heard what you said,\u201d he had whispered. \u201cThank you, Y/N.\u201d The boy placed a kiss on your hand, letting his lips linger against your skin. He gave you a smile and walked down the wall without another word. Every night since then, you had thought of that night.</p><p>\tYou had always thought Jon was handsome, kind, and good hearted. He wasn\u2019t arrogant like Theon Greyjoy, nor was he as outspoken as Robb Stark. Jon was quiet yet it was easy to tell how he was feeling. So you noticed when Jon was being quite distant, due to an anger inside of him. You saw little of him, since you were a handmaiden; but when you did, he was scowling. His brown eyes, the same ones you could get lost in, were dark with annoyance. </p><p>\tThis evening, while walking through the yard, you noticed Jon held that same expression on his features. The dusk light seemed to make the furrow in his forehead deeper as Theon talked loudly in his ear. Jon looked over at you, his gaze softening when he did. You offered him a smile and he weakly returned it. Something was bothering him, but you couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>\t\u201cY/N, there you are!\u201d You turned your head, facing forward to see Robb walking towards you. His reddish-brown curls bounced as he walked over to you, a boyish smile on his features. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d he said and you blushed.</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was needed,\u201d you said. Robb chuckled and rested a gentle hand on your upper arm. You smiled and Robb leaned towards you slightly.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re always needed by at least one of us young wolves.\u201d His eyes jerked over to glance at Jon quickly. Your blush deepened and let out a small, embarrassed giggle. Leave it to Robb to tease you about your affections for Jon.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say, my lord.\u201d Robb chuckled once more and straighten his posture. His eyebrows were raised in question and you shook your head.</p><p>\t\u201cYou know what I mean, Y/N. Jon may be acting strangely, but it\u2019s not without reason. He is raised as my brother, so I know when he is-\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat in the bloody hells, Snow!\u201d You and Robb turned your heads, looking over to where Theon had shouted. Theon\u2019s nose was leaking blood from his nose; but that didn\u2019t deter him from trying to hit Jon. The Greyjoy\u2019s fist landed against Jon\u2019s cheek, sending the bastard staggering backwards slightly. After he caught himself, Jon lunged towards Theon and pushed him to the ground. You started yelling as Robb rushed over to the two other boys.</p><p>\t\u201cStop this madness,\u201d Robb said as he pulled Jon off of Theon. You rushed over and grabbed the bastards arm to stop him from swinging again. Jon looked down at you, letting your gaze focus on the dark bruise forming on his face. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You asked out loud and Theon let out a forced chuckle. Jon turned his head to face the ward and his jaw clenched. You tighten your grip around his arm, holding Jon in place. Robb helped the Greyjoy up and the boy wiped at his nose.</p><p>\t\u201cSnow can\u2019t handle the truth, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d You glanced up at Jon whose nostril flared at Theon\u2019s words. You looked over at Robb who had a frown on his face.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll take Theon to see the Maester for his nose,\u201d the young Stark said. \u201cY/N can you take care of Jon?\u201d You nodded and pulled on Jon\u2019s arms slightly. </p><p>\t\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d you moved your grip from his arm to his hand. The touch seemed to be enough to get Jon to follow you willingly. Your fingers entangled with his, leading him inside the barracks of Winterfell. You knew where Jon\u2019s room was, after spending time with him in there as children.</p><p>\tWhen you reached his door, you pushed inside. Jon shut the door behind the two of you, letting go of your hand as he did. You missed the feeling of his hand in yours, but pushed it down as you searched for a rag. You found one and grabbed the bucket of water that was warming near Jon\u2019s small fireplace. </p><p>\t\u201cSit,\u201d you said, turning back to look at Jon. He nodded without a word and sat on the edge of his bed. You pulled over a stool and sat in front of him. You set the bucket on the ground, dipping the rag in the warm water. \u201cSo what really happened?\u201d </p><p>\tJon let out a small sigh and you smiled shyly up at him. You squeezed the rag of excess water and grabbed the hand he punched Theon with. A cut was on one of his knuckles so you rested the rag against it. Jon let out a hiss as you applied pressure.</p><p>\t\u201cTheon told you,\u201d Jon said suddenly. You looked up from his hand and met Jon\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t handle the truth. For once in his sorry life, he\u2019s right about something.\u201d You let out a small chuckle and you saw a small smile find it\u2019s way on Jon\u2019s lips. You blushed slightly and looked back to Jon\u2019s hand. The skin of his palm was rough against your own and you couldn\u2019t help but wonder what his hands would feel like against your softer parts of skin.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is the truth you can\u2019t bear to believe,\u201d you asked, trying to focus your thoughts. Jon shifted and you glanced up to his eyes. His brown eyes seemed darker in the dim light to this bedroom. Shadows were cast across his face by his dark hair falling around him like a halo.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really,\u201d he said and you raised your eyebrows. Jon let a dramatic breath out from his nose and gently pulled his hand away from yours.</p><p>\t\u201cYou are a terrible liar, Jon. Now, tell me how Theon is right. It\u2019s a shock to me,\u201d you teased, \u201cI almost don\u2019t believe it.\u201d You brought the rag up to his face, resting it softly against his bruised cheek. His eyes met yours, holding your gaze for a long time before speaking.</p><p>\t\u201cTheon\u2019s been saying you\u2019ll be married soon. That Lady Stark plans to wed you off to some River lord,\u201d he paused and glanced away from your eyes. \u201cOr maybe Robb,\u201d he whispered. Your brows furrowed and confusion set in. </p><p>\t\u201cJon,\u201d you said, placing a finger under his chin. He looked back at you, his dark eyes saddened. Your heart broke at the sight and you pulled the rag away from his face. \u201cLady Catelyn hasn\u2019t spoken to me about it and if she did, I would politely decline.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d Jon asked, genuinely surprised. \u201cRobb is strong, he\u2019s kind, and he has the right name. He\u2019s a true Stark, not a Snow.\u201d You lifted a hand to his face, your thumb tracing over his cheekbone. Jon stared into your eyes, letting his true feelings shine through them. </p><p>\t\u201cRobb is my friend,\u201d you said, \u201cbut I will never love him in the idea of marriage. My heart is taken by another.\u201d Your faces were close now, too close to just be considered friends caring for each other. \u201cSomeone who is capable, compassionate, and so loving. But he\u2019s been acting weird. Too quiet almost, got into a fight today too. \u201d </p><p>\t\u201cSounds like a prick,\u201d Jon teased. You smiled at him and so did he. Jon was happy for the first time since he pulled you to the side in the hallway; but he still felt unworthy of your affection. \u201cYou deserve someone better than him,\u201d he whispered. You simply shook your head.</p><p>\t\u201cNo,\u201d you said quietly, \u201che\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d You leaned towards him, closing that gap between you. Brushing your lips against his, you teased him slowly. Jon had soon had enough and reached a hand to your face. He crashed his lips on yours, the rag in your hand dropping to the floor. Jon\u2019s free hand pulled you up from the stool, hauling you onto his lap. You giggled against his lips, making Jon smile into the kiss. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re sure I\u2019m what you want?\u201d He mumbled against your lips, muddling the kiss. You pulled away slightly, looking into his eyes. You lightly traced the skin around his bruised cheek, a soft smile on your lips as you did. Your heart fluttered in your chest as you looked in his eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d you whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve never been more certain.\u201d He nodded and leaned towards you again. His full lips landed on yours, molding perfectly. With one of his hands on your jaw, the other on your hip, Jon pulled you closer to his body. </p><p>\t\u201cGood,\u201d he murmured against your skin. \u201cI want you too,\u201d you smiled and kissed his lips. </p><p>\t\u201cI believe the proper words is \u2018love\u2019,\u201d you teased. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow. That is why I want you.\u201d He smiled and looked into your eyes. All he could see was love and admiration; and he knew the same expression was in his gaze as well.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too, Y/N Y/L/N.\u201d You smiled brightly at him and Jon\u2019s smile widened. His dark mood fading from his mind. Your kisses made him wonder why he was even sad in the first place. Jon himself had forgotten, too caught up in your touch and care.</p>",

The summer air was slightly cold as the sun faded from the sky. Winter was coming, that was certain. The sky would soon stay grey and the long night would fall over the whole of Westeros. For the Stark words do come true, as they always do.<br></p><p>\tThe Starks were busy preparing for the coming winter, training their children to become fearsome, yet honorable, warriors. Even Arya showed promise with a bow. Jon had been aiding in her training away from Lady Catelyn\u2019s eyes. It was for the best, safe for the both of them. Arya and Jon got on so well, you could remember once the young girl asked if she was a bastard like her half-brother. You took the opportunity to educate her. </p><p>\t\u201cNo, little one. You are trueborn, but Jon being a bastard doesn\u2019t make him any less honorable.\u201d Your words gave Arya a calm feeling, while it gave Jon, who was behind the little wolf\u2019s door, a large smile. When you had entered the hall, Jon grabbed your hand. He had pulled you close to him, leaning against the wall away from Arya\u2019s door. </p><p>\t\u201cI heard what you said,\u201d he had whispered. \u201cThank you, Y/N.\u201d The boy placed a kiss on your hand, letting his lips linger against your skin. He gave you a smile and walked down the wall without another word. Every night since then, you had thought of that night.</p><p>\tYou had always thought Jon was handsome, kind, and good hearted. He wasn\u2019t arrogant like Theon Greyjoy, nor was he as outspoken as Robb Stark. Jon was quiet yet it was easy to tell how he was feeling. So you noticed when Jon was being quite distant, due to an anger inside of him. You saw little of him, since you were a handmaiden; but when you did, he was scowling. His brown eyes, the same ones you could get lost in, were dark with annoyance. </p><p>\tThis evening, while walking through the yard, you noticed Jon held that same expression on his features. The dusk light seemed to make the furrow in his forehead deeper as Theon talked loudly in his ear. Jon looked over at you, his gaze softening when he did. You offered him a smile and he weakly returned it. Something was bothering him, but you couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>\t\u201cY/N, there you are!\u201d You turned your head, facing forward to see Robb walking towards you. His reddish-brown curls bounced as he walked over to you, a boyish smile on his features. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d he said and you blushed.</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was needed,\u201d you said. Robb chuckled and rested a gentle hand on your upper arm. You smiled and Robb leaned towards you slightly.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re always needed by at least one of us young wolves.\u201d His eyes jerked over to glance at Jon quickly. Your blush deepened and let out a small, embarrassed giggle. Leave it to Robb to tease you about your affections for Jon.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say, my lord.\u201d Robb chuckled once more and straighten his posture. His eyebrows were raised in question and you shook your head.</p><p>\t\u201cYou know what I mean, Y/N. Jon may be acting strangely, but it\u2019s not without reason. He is raised as my brother, so I know when he is-\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat in the bloody hells, Snow!\u201d You and Robb turned your heads, looking over to where Theon had shouted. Theon\u2019s nose was leaking blood from his nose; but that didn\u2019t deter him from trying to hit Jon. The Greyjoy\u2019s fist landed against Jon\u2019s cheek, sending the bastard staggering backwards slightly. After he caught himself, Jon lunged towards Theon and pushed him to the ground. You started yelling as Robb rushed over to the two other boys.</p><p>\t\u201cStop this madness,\u201d Robb said as he pulled Jon off of Theon. You rushed over and grabbed the bastards arm to stop him from swinging again. Jon looked down at you, letting your gaze focus on the dark bruise forming on his face. </p><p>\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You asked out loud and Theon let out a forced chuckle. Jon turned his head to face the ward and his jaw clenched. You tighten your grip around his arm, holding Jon in place. Robb helped the Greyjoy up and the boy wiped at his nose.</p><p>\t\u201cSnow can\u2019t handle the truth, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d You glanced up at Jon whose nostril flared at Theon\u2019s words. You looked over at Robb who had a frown on his face.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll take Theon to see the Maester for his nose,\u201d the young Stark said. \u201cY/N can you take care of Jon?\u201d You nodded and pulled on Jon\u2019s arms slightly. </p><p>\t\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d you moved your grip from his arm to his hand. The touch seemed to be enough to get Jon to follow you willingly. Your fingers entangled with his, leading him inside the barracks of Winterfell. You knew where Jon\u2019s room was, after spending time with him in there as children.</p><p>\tWhen you reached his door, you pushed inside. Jon shut the door behind the two of you, letting go of your hand as he did. You missed the feeling of his hand in yours, but pushed it down as you searched for a rag. You found one and grabbed the bucket of water that was warming near Jon\u2019s small fireplace. </p><p>\t\u201cSit,\u201d you said, turning back to look at Jon. He nodded without a word and sat on the edge of his bed. You pulled over a stool and sat in front of him. You set the bucket on the ground, dipping the rag in the warm water. \u201cSo what really happened?\u201d </p><p>\tJon let out a small sigh and you smiled shyly up at him. You squeezed the rag of excess water and grabbed the hand he punched Theon with. A cut was on one of his knuckles so you rested the rag against it. Jon let out a hiss as you applied pressure.</p><p>\t\u201cTheon told you,\u201d Jon said suddenly. You looked up from his hand and met Jon\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t handle the truth. For once in his sorry life, he\u2019s right about something.\u201d You let out a small chuckle and you saw a small smile find it\u2019s way on Jon\u2019s lips. You blushed slightly and looked back to Jon\u2019s hand. The skin of his palm was rough against your own and you couldn\u2019t help but wonder what his hands would feel like against your softer parts of skin.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is the truth you can\u2019t bear to believe,\u201d you asked, trying to focus your thoughts. Jon shifted and you glanced up to his eyes. His brown eyes seemed darker in the dim light to this bedroom. Shadows were cast across his face by his dark hair falling around him like a halo.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really,\u201d he said and you raised your eyebrows. Jon let a dramatic breath out from his nose and gently pulled his hand away from yours.</p><p>\t\u201cYou are a terrible liar, Jon. Now, tell me how Theon is right. It\u2019s a shock to me,\u201d you teased, \u201cI almost don\u2019t believe it.\u201d You brought the rag up to his face, resting it softly against his bruised cheek. His eyes met yours, holding your gaze for a long time before speaking.</p><p>\t\u201cTheon\u2019s been saying you\u2019ll be married soon. That Lady Stark plans to wed you off to some River lord,\u201d he paused and glanced away from your eyes. \u201cOr maybe Robb,\u201d he whispered. Your brows furrowed and confusion set in. </p><p>\t\u201cJon,\u201d you said, placing a finger under his chin. He looked back at you, his dark eyes saddened. Your heart broke at the sight and you pulled the rag away from his face. \u201cLady Catelyn hasn\u2019t spoken to me about it and if she did, I would politely decline.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d Jon asked, genuinely surprised. \u201cRobb is strong, he\u2019s kind, and he has the right name. He\u2019s a true Stark, not a Snow.\u201d You lifted a hand to his face, your thumb tracing over his cheekbone. Jon stared into your eyes, letting his true feelings shine through them. </p><p>\t\u201cRobb is my friend,\u201d you said, \u201cbut I will never love him in the idea of marriage. My heart is taken by another.\u201d Your faces were close now, too close to just be considered friends caring for each other. \u201cSomeone who is capable, compassionate, and so loving. But he\u2019s been acting weird. Too quiet almost, got into a fight today too. \u201d </p><p>\t\u201cSounds like a prick,\u201d Jon teased. You smiled at him and so did he. Jon was happy for the first time since he pulled you to the side in the hallway; but he still felt unworthy of your affection. \u201cYou deserve someone better than him,\u201d he whispered. You simply shook your head.</p><p>\t\u201cNo,\u201d you said quietly, \u201che\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d You leaned towards him, closing that gap between you. Brushing your lips against his, you teased him slowly. Jon had soon had enough and reached a hand to your face. He crashed his lips on yours, the rag in your hand dropping to the floor. Jon\u2019s free hand pulled you up from the stool, hauling you onto his lap. You giggled against his lips, making Jon smile into the kiss. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re sure I\u2019m what you want?\u201d He mumbled against your lips, muddling the kiss. You pulled away slightly, looking into his eyes. You lightly traced the skin around his bruised cheek, a soft smile on your lips as you did. Your heart fluttered in your chest as you looked in his eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d you whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve never been more certain.\u201d He nodded and leaned towards you again. His full lips landed on yours, molding perfectly. With one of his hands on your jaw, the other on your hip, Jon pulled you closer to his body. </p><p>\t\u201cGood,\u201d he murmured against your skin. \u201cI want you too,\u201d you smiled and kissed his lips. </p><p>\t\u201cI believe the proper words is \u2018love\u2019,\u201d you teased. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow. That is why I want you.\u201d He smiled and looked into your eyes. All he could see was love and admiration; and he knew the same expression was in his gaze as well.</p><p>\t\u201cI love you too, Y/N Y/L/N.\u201d You smiled brightly at him and Jon\u2019s smile widened. His dark mood fading from his mind. Your kisses made him wonder why he was even sad in the first place. Jon himself had forgotten, too caught up in your touch and care.</p>",

But Winterfell was a big castle, full of thick and warm walls that could shield you from the winter. There was a hidden little spot, just between the Library Tower and the Kitchens, perfect for a shadow to blend in with the great grey walls. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why did you bend the knee?</i>&rdquo; he heard the Stark boy ask the newly appointed Warden of the North.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>To protect the North</i>&rdquo; Jon Snow replied, quickly and firmly. </p><p>One of his fears was now confirmed. <i>Winterfell&rsquo;s Bastard is playing the game. A dangerous game,</i>\u00a0he thought with surprise in his mind and fear in his heart. <i>Nothing good can come out of a fight between the Dragon and the pack of Wolves</i>. His thoughts were turning somber at great speed.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>And why do you feel like you have to protect it?</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Because it&rsquo;s my duty, It&rsquo;s always been. Ever since I swore an oath</i>&rdquo; \u00a0he heard Jon Snow say. <i>His duty lies with his family and with his people. Like everyone in this realm&hellip; but he mentioned his oath</i>, he reflected.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>And that duty, that desire to protect the North, where does it come from?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I protect it because it&rsquo;s my home, a part of me</i>&rdquo; \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Your home, and you love it. Sometimes, duty and love go hand in hand, but sometimes, we must choose between one and the other. Father chose both, his love was with your mother, as same as his duty. Robb chose love, forsaking his duty. Jon, you&rsquo;ve chosen duty over love so many times. You have the chance to choose love, now</i>&rdquo;. What the youngest son of Ned Stark said left him wondering. </p><p>&ldquo;His love was with your mother&hellip;&rdquo; he repeated that over and over in his head. Lord Eddard Stark never said the name of his bastard&rsquo;s mother. Some said it was a lowborn woman, others said it was Ashara Dayne, but no one had a definitive answer. Why would Eddard Stark&rsquo;s love and duty lie with a mysterious woman, when he was a devoted husband to Catelyn Tully, when it was known that there was love in their marriage? He had heard of the time when Lady Stark had visited the capital, a lifetime ago&hellip; He felt as if he was looking at some forbidden image, without being able to decipher its meaning.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>But what about my duty? What about Daenerys?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Everthing will work out the way it&rsquo;s supposed to</i>&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>The sound of the dragons flying over the castle broke him from his thoughts. He took it as a sign that it was time for him to leave.</p><p>He headed towards the Kitchens, trying to look incospicous. He asked one of the maids to bring him some warmed dornish red, along with some broth.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, m'lord. It&rsquo;ll be in your room in a moment&rdquo; said the young maid. </p><p>He just bowed his head as a wordless &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.</p><p>He took his time getting out of the Kitchens. He could see that Lord Eddard&rsquo;s daughter had managed to bring all the grains and resources she could. He heard whispers of the Lady of Winterfell, how she took care of her people. The movements in the Kitchens and in the Armory were a testament of that. <i>Who knew that little girl that once was Joffrey&rsquo;s plaything could become such a competent ruler</i>, he reflected. <i>It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, though. She learned how not to do things from the most incompetent monarchs in recent history&hellip; And Littlefinger</i>, he remembered. He heard whispers of him teaching her all he knows. <i>If it&rsquo;s true, that wouldn&rsquo;t only make her a competent ruler but also a skilled politician</i>. He dwelled on that thought for a while.</p><p>He wandered a bit in the courtyard, watching the men and women train for the umpending battle against the dead. He saw Brienne of Tarth, commanding a small garrison of soldiers, teaching them all she could, given the little time they had. But the training of soldiers didn&rsquo;t capture his attention, the little She-Wolf did. He saw Lady Arya practice her shooting. All of the arrows she had fired had hit the bullseye. Just as he was turning his eyes to her again, he found her staring at him. She still had the bow tensed, the arrow ready to be fired. They locked eyes for mere seconds, but in those mere seconds she hit the bullseye yet again, all while glaring at him. Then, just as she arched an eyebrown, a small smug smile forming on her lips. He felt as if he had given her something. Unsettled, he bowed his head to her and left. He felt an incredibly strong need to be alone. <i>Things are not going as planned. The pups are wild beasts now. And we must act accordingly</i>, he thought.</p><p>While making his way towards the Guest Keep, he saw Jon Snow all but run towards the Great Keep, with Winterfell&rsquo;s maester trying to keep up with him. He looked like a soldier, marching towards the battlefield. <i>A man with purpose</i>, he told himself. And again, the conversation he had with his brother came back to him. With all of this in mind, he headed towards his chambers.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;My dear friend&rdquo; Tyrion greeted him.</p><p>&ldquo;I was under the impression you wanted to have a few words with Jon Snow&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Tyrion grabbed a cup and started pouring some of the warmed Dornish red he had asked for, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a busy man&rdquo; he said before taking a long sip. &ldquo;But what about you? I came here to talk about our Queen, only to find an empty room&rdquo; he told him with fake dissapointment. &ldquo;Are you already weaving your little webs, Lord Varys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must have information, valuable information, in order to weave anything. And I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me, my friend, when I say that northmen aren&rsquo;t the sharing type&rdquo; pointed out the Spider. After this, silence surrounded them. He did the same as Tyrion; grabbed a cup and poured some Dornish red. The warmth of the drink relaxed him a bit; if he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend they were south of the Neck. Almost.</p><p>They both had their missions. He had to find out any valuable information that would be useful, and Tyrion had to make the Starks understand the situation they were all dealing with, without offending anyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Have you found anything?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing good. Turns out Jon Snow isn&rsquo;t as much of a fool as we all thought. His loyalties lie with the North and the Starks&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But then why is he-&rdquo; Tyrion stopped on his tracks as realization dawned on his face. &ldquo;He managed to bring her all this way North to fight alongside him&rdquo; he said while rubbing his neck. He opened his mouth to say something, but inmediately closed it. He jumped out of his chair and started pacing around the room. &ldquo;Do you realize what this means? One wrong look, one wrong word, and we&rsquo;re fucked&rdquo; he claimed.</p><p>&ldquo;We can still salvage this alliance. She still believes him to be loyal to her&rdquo; Varys tried to appease his friend.</p><p>&ldquo;She believes him to be in love with her&rdquo; he claimed, while coming to a halt. He looked at Varys with pleading eyes, reminding him of something only the two of them knew. &ldquo;Did you found anything else?&rdquo; he sighed.</p><p>Varys had his doubts about telling him about the rest of the conversation he overheard &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bring up an assumption and speak of it as if it were the truth&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must keep digging&rdquo;. He took a long sip of his cup. &ldquo;No. Not yet, at least&rdquo;.</p><p>Tyrion let out a long, heavy sigh. &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo; he said as he put his cup on the table and made his way to the door. &ldquo;Since the Warden of the North is busy, it seems I must talk to my Lady wife&rdquo; he jested.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the same girl we&rsquo;ve both seen at the Capital&rdquo; he reminded him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo; he replied, all humor gone from his voice, &ldquo;she made that perfectly clear the same day we arrived&rdquo; he declared, with a sour tone. He stood still, facing the door, but Varys knew Tyrion. He had more to say. He was right; Tyrion pivoted and took long steps towards him, as long as his legs would allow him. &ldquo;I think she knows about the Reach&rdquo; he confessed.</p><p>This surprised Varys. &ldquo;You think she knows about what exactly?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;About the Tarlys?&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion just shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, all of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could she possibly know all of it?&rdquo; he wondered, &ldquo;news don&rsquo;t travel as fast during winter&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, somehow the Lady of Winterfell knows about what our Queen did&rdquo; he noted.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not good&rdquo; Varys pointed out. &ldquo;These Stark children are definetely not like their parents. More difficult to read, and even more difficul to handle&rdquo; he thought. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fucked, Varys. Sansa can say all those very convincing words, and Daenerys can choose to believe all of it&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that none of us are welcomed here. Not you, not me, and definetely not our Queen&rdquo; he went back to table and poured the rest of the Dornish red in his cup. After taking a very long sip, he continued &ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With whom?</p><p>Tyrion sighed yet again. &quot;With all of them&rdquo; he said after putting down his cup. He marched towards the door, and when he opened it, the cold air of the North crep into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fucking cold&rdquo; Tyrion muttered as he left.</p><p>Finally, Varys was left alone. Alone with his thoughts, and other people&rsquo;s truths and secrets. <i>But it&rsquo;s not enough</i>, he reminded himself. \u00a0He dwelled on these thoughts while eating his broth, until a hard knock echoed in the whole room.</p><p>He opened the door and was surprised to see one of the Unsullied. &ldquo;Queen Daenerys requires your presence&rdquo; the warrior announced, his back straightened and his eyes looking at some fixed point behind Varys.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well&rdquo; he said to the young Unsullied.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>He found the young Targaryen queen looking at the snowy fields of the North through a window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, the North&rdquo; she said with some melancholy in her voice, still looking through the window. </p><p>&ldquo;It is, Your Grace. Though it&rsquo;s far too cold for my liking&rdquo; he offered, politely.</p><p>&ldquo;As it is for me&rdquo; she replied, looking at him over her shoulder. &ldquo;Please, sit&rdquo; she gestured with her hand at the chairs that were by the hearth. Then she gave a single nod to the Unsullied. Now, they were alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I wasn&rsquo;t summoned to talk about the chilly winds of the North&rdquo; he said as he sat down. The firewood from the hearth were cackling, making little noises, yet as he seated close to it to fight the cold, he couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder&hellip;<i> How can something be there to protect you from something but also be a threat itself?</i></p><p>&ldquo;No, you were not&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I summoned you because I want to talk about the North&rdquo; she said as she seated across him by the hearth.</p><p>The conversation he had with Tyrion earlier came back to his mind.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;With all of them&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p>&ldquo;I know they don&rsquo;t want me&rdquo; Daenerys said, with a mix of sadness, dissapointment and anger tinting her voice.</p><p>Varys only sighed. He knew she was far from over, that she needed to vent, so he let her. </p><p>\u201cNot the North, not the lords and ladies, not Lady Sansa and her family&quot; she remarked, anger starting to show in her voice and features. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to save them, can&rsquo;t they see?&rdquo; She then looked at him with her beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with doubts. Eyes trying to mask a thunderstorm. </p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace, the northmen are known for being proud. They just need a little more time. To get to know you&rdquo; he offered her. At his words, Daenerys seemed to relaxed a little, fixing her eyes in the fire. He took it as a sign to continue. &ldquo;You have to remember that the last memory they have of Targaryens are those of your father and eldest brother. They are not remembered fondly here&rdquo;.</p><p>The mention of her father and brother made her snapped her eyes back at him. &ldquo;And pray tell, Lord Varys, what do I have to do for the people of Westeros to realize I&rsquo;m not father nor my brother?&rdquo; she fumed.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect them to forget the last two decades, my Queen. But you can show them that there is more to the Targaryen name than your father and brother&rdquo; he insisted. </p><p>She returned her gaze to the flames. The way she seemed to be so enthralled by its dance reminded him of the red priestesses of R'hollor. Although the hearth gave the room some warmth, he still got chills.</p><p>&ldquo;I will show them there is more to the Targaryen name&rdquo; she echoed, still looking at the flames. But a thought seemed to snap her out of its spell. &ldquo;What about the Starks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon has been avoiding me since we arrived. Lady Sansa is courteous, yet I can see the ice in her eyes&rdquo;. she said in an exasperated tone. &ldquo;How do you suggest I win over the Lady of Winterfell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are both women of power, maybe you can try by starting there. Maybe you can open up to her about your experiences in Essos, let her get to know you&rdquo; he proposed.</p><p>She looked at him, with narrowed eyes, analyzing what he just said. Then, she turned her eyes to the flames again. &ldquo;What about Jon?&rdquo; she sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Tyrion wasn&rsquo;t able to reach him this morning. Winterfell&rsquo;s maester said he was busy discussing some strategies on how to defeat the Night King with his brother and the Tarly boy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he was discussing strategies, weren&rsquo;t we suppossed to be ther-&rdquo; she complained, but stopped herself when realization dawned in her eyes. &ldquo;Did you say Tarly boy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Samwell Tarly, Your Grace. Randyll Tarly&rsquo;s eldest son. He&rsquo;s a sworn brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. They tell me he&rsquo;s close friends with Jon Snow&rdquo; he explained. </p><p>The implications of what he just told her didn&rsquo;t escape her. Her queenly mask was slowly coming off. Varys could only look at her. Enthralled by the flames, she just stood still. The flames made her eyes shine in a beautiful and disturbing way.</p><p>&ldquo;That will be all, Lord Varys&rdquo; she said, never taking her eyes from the fire. &ldquo;Thank you for your counsel&rdquo;.</p><p>He respectfully bowed and walked out of her chambers as fast as propriety allowed. <i>She shouldn&rsquo;t be alone right now</i>, he thought. When he arrived to the entrance of the Guest Keep, he told one of the Dothraki posted there &ldquo;Go find Missandei of Naath. Tell her her Queen needs to speak to her&rdquo;.</p><p>He hoped Missandei&rsquo;s friendship and presence would act like a balm to the Dragon Queen&rsquo;s strong passions.</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>He was in the Kitchens, eating some hot broth, when a young maid came to him. He had asked his little birds to fly around the Wolves&rsquo; castle, looking for anything that might be useful. Most of them came empty-handed. But this young maid, Darla, she was one of the good ones.</p><p>&ldquo;M'lord, this is all I could find&rdquo; she said as she handed \u00a0him a piece of paper. &ldquo;I tried to write as fast as I could&rdquo; she explained.</p><p>Varys opened the piece of paper and read it, but he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. He reread what Darla had written. &ldquo;Where did you find this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The chambers of that man from the Night&rsquo;s Watch. It was in an old book&rdquo; the young maid looked at him with impatient eyes. &ldquo;So, is it any good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea, young girl&rdquo; he told her as he gave her five gold dragons. At this, the young woman nodded and mouthed a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and left as fast as she could.</p><p>Now, the conversation between Bran Stark and Jon Snow made more sense. <i>This changes everything</i>, he thought. And his mind filled with those familiar doubts, but now they found a new partner in some treasonous thoughts. </p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\n<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Varys liked the view from the battlements. The view of the vast snowy fields surrounding Winterfell could be an image that brought him peace and comfort; but given the threat of eternal winter, the view made him as if were staring at the flames, like he did all those years ago. He let out a heavy sigh, the cold air making it visible.<i> If only I could see things like I see this</i>, he reflected,<i> then maybe I could make my move</i>.</p><p>He remembered Littlefinger, then. Always eager to make his move, one that drive him forward, closer to his goal. <i>And because he&rsquo;s always so eager he leaves chaos in his wake. Chaos that loves to prey on others</i>, he thought. He remembered what Lady Sansa has said about him during the welcoming feast. &ldquo;<i>He went to the Vale, to oversee some things regarding the food</i>\u201d Ned Stark&rsquo;s daughter has said. But he knew Petyr Baelish, he knew him very well, and it was not like him to miss such an opportunity like this. <i>He&rsquo;s the master of chaos, and a Targaryen in Winterfell would be just the kind of situation he would like to exploit</i>. Maybe Lady Sansa was telling the truth. <i>But if it is the turth she was saying, that means she has power over him. And to have power over someone like Littlefinger&hellip;</i></p><p>His thoughts were interrumpted by the sound of someone approaching him. He turned around to find Ser Davos Seaworth. The man was a loyal and trusted advisor of Jon Snow. <i>Maybe he can give me some insight of what&rsquo;s Winterfell like under the rule of Eddard Stark&rsquo;s children</i>, he thought.</p><p>&quot;Ser Davos&rdquo; he greeted him with a light bow.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Varys&rdquo; he said, with some surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I didn&rsquo;t expect you to find out here. It&rsquo;s freezing cold&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just admiring what the North has to offer, ser&rdquo; he replied, returning his eyes to vast fields covered in snow.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a lot to admire, I&rsquo;d say. But we don&rsquo;t get to see this much snow on the South, so I think there is some beauty in it&rdquo; he commented.</p><p>&ldquo;What brings you here? Like you said, it&rsquo;s freezing cold&rdquo; he asked</p><p>&ldquo;War council. We&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to make best use of the battlements and the high grounds. We must use any advantage we have&rdquo; he answered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a military man, I do not understand the art of war&rdquo; he admitted &ldquo;but if there&rsquo;s a war council being held soon, let me know so I can inform our Queen&rdquo;</p><p>Davos Seaworth turned his head to him when he said our Queen. He was one of the very few that knew that Jon Snow was no longer King in the North. <i>Hopefully, it stays like that until the North warms up to Daenerys</i>, he thought.</p><p>Just as he turned his head to him, he turned it back to the fields. But they didn&rsquo;t capture his attention, since he turned his head back at him again, his eyes narrowed. &ldquo;May I ask you a question, Lord Varys?&rdquo; He nodded in response. &ldquo;Why do you serve Daenerys Targaryen?&rdquo;</p><p>Varys smiled at the bold man. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not like any other ruler the Seven Kingdoms have seen&rdquo; he offered. A nice, short and safe answer.</p><p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;She has dragons, but I guess that makes her like her ancestors&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried she might be like some of them? Like the worst of them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Consider me a subject interested in his new Queen. You see, Lord Varys, while Jon and I were in Dragonstone, we didn&rsquo;t get the chance to know much about her&rdquo; he replied</p><p>&ldquo;A wasted opportunity, I know. I advised her to let her people know her. I believe that will bring peace of mind to many&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. But northerners are tough, they&rsquo;re loyal to their own&rdquo; he argued. A small laugh left his lips after he said this, it was as if he was remembering something. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t earn their trust easily. It took me a long time and a bloody battle for me to earn the trust of many around here&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;She will make a good Queen, ser Davos. You have my word&rdquo;</p><p>Ser Davos chuckled at his answer. &ldquo;Can I be honest with you, Lord Varys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always&rdquo; he said, with a little bow</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your word they need. Like you said, they don&rsquo;t know her, and for them to accept her would take time&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;But time is something we don&rsquo;t have. I hope Queen Daenerys earns the North&rsquo;s trust. I really do&rdquo; he sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best for the realm, dear ser&rdquo; he assured him.</p><p>&ldquo;And what if she doesn&rsquo;t? What happens then?&rdquo; He had his narrowed eyes fixed on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope she does earn their trust, ser Davos&rdquo; he replied, the answer he really wanted to give him hidden in the words he said.</p><p>Davos Seaworth&rsquo;s narrowed eyes now widened. He seemed to understand what he meant to say. He took a deep breath while staring at the white snowed fields surrounding the castle, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope she does&rdquo; he echoed. After a few moments of silent meditation, ser Davos turned to him once more. &ldquo;Lord Varys&rdquo; he said as a goodbye.</p><p>He just nodded. The words of the onion knight echoed in his mind. Whether someone sent him or not, one thing was clear. Daenerys wasn&rsquo;t wanted here. Not as Queen, anyways. The North seemed very content with Sansa Stark as Lady of Winterfell and Jon Snow as their King. <i>A great pair</i>, he thought, <i>a most capable politician and a renowned warrior</i>. He let out a long sigh. He knew what this meant. <i>The Queen doesn&rsquo;t handle rejection very well, what happened at the Reach is testament of that</i>, he reflected. He decided he had enough of the winter winds for one day and headed to the Great Keep, looking for the only person able to appease the people.</p><p>He walked across the courtyard, where many men, women and children old enough to fight were training. Some with sword, others with bow and arrow. There were even some with spears, being trained by Greyworm. As he walked, he wondered how many people would die fighting for the living. <i>Let&rsquo;s just hope we win, otherwise it would&rsquo;ve been all for nothing</i>. </p><p>When he arrived at his destination, he took a deep breath to give himself some courage. <i>Give some in order to get some</i>, he reminded himself. <i>That&rsquo;s what this is about. Information</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you, m'lord?&rdquo; a northern man, no more than three-and-twenty, asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;d like to talk to Lady Stark&rdquo; he replied. He could see the anxiety in the young man&rsquo;s eyes. <i>Sansa Stark is not one to inspire fear. Something must&rsquo;ve happened.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait here, m'lord&rdquo;. After that, the young northman entered Lady Sansa&rsquo;s solar. A few minutes passed until the guard came out. &ldquo;Lady Sansa is waiting for you inside, m'lord&rdquo; the young man said with a light bow of his head.</p><p>As soon as the heavy wooden doors closed, Sansa Stark stood up. &ldquo;Lord Varys, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to see you so soon&rdquo; she said, not as the little lady he remembered from King&rsquo;s Landing, but as Lady of a great castle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid, my Lady, we weren&rsquo;t able to finish our conversation&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we did&rdquo; she said as she approached him. &ldquo;You were very clear on your stance, Lord Varys, and I like to believe I was very clear on mine&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s nothing left to discuss&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Lady Sansa&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not our last conversation that brought me here today&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Then what is it that brought you here today, Lord Varys?&rdquo; she asked, her face relaxed, but with ice in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Your family.

But Winterfell was a big castle, full of thick and warm walls that could shield you from the winter. There was a hidden little spot, just between the Library Tower and the Kitchens, perfect for a shadow to blend in with the great grey walls. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Why did you bend the knee?</i>&rdquo; he heard the Stark boy ask the newly appointed Warden of the North.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>To protect the North</i>&rdquo; Jon Snow replied, quickly and firmly. </p>\n<p>One of his fears was now confirmed. <i>Winterfell&rsquo;s Bastard is playing the game. A dangerous game,</i>&nbsp;he thought with surprise in his mind and fear in his heart. <i>Nothing good can come out of a fight between the Dragon and the pack of Wolves</i>. His thoughts were turning somber at great speed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>And why do you feel like you have to protect it?</i>&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Because it&rsquo;s my duty, It&rsquo;s always been. Ever since I swore an oath</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;he heard Jon Snow say. <i>His duty lies with his family and with his people. Like everyone in this realm&hellip; but he mentioned his oath</i>, he reflected.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>And that duty, that desire to protect the North, where does it come from?</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>I protect it because it&rsquo;s my home, a part of me</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Your home, and you love it. Sometimes, duty and love go hand in hand, but sometimes, we must choose between one and the other. Father chose both, his love was with your mother, as same as his duty. Robb chose love, forsaking his duty. Jon, you&rsquo;ve chosen duty over love so many times. You have the chance to choose love, now</i>&rdquo;. What the youngest son of Ned Stark said left him wondering. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;His love was with your mother&hellip;&rdquo; he repeated that over and over in his head. Lord Eddard Stark never said the name of his bastard&rsquo;s mother. Some said it was a lowborn woman, others said it was Ashara Dayne, but no one had a definitive answer. Why would Eddard Stark&rsquo;s love and duty lie with a mysterious woman, when he was a devoted husband to Catelyn Tully, when it was known that there was love in their marriage? He had heard of the time when Lady Stark had visited the capital, a lifetime ago&hellip; He felt as if he was looking at some forbidden image, without being able to decipher its meaning.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>But what about my duty? What about Daenerys?</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Everthing will work out the way it&rsquo;s supposed to</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The sound of the dragons flying over the castle broke him from his thoughts. He took it as a sign that it was time for him to leave.</p>\n<p>He headed towards the Kitchens, trying to look incospicous. He asked one of the maids to bring him some warmed dornish red, along with some broth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, m'lord. It&rsquo;ll be in your room in a moment&rdquo; said the young maid. </p>\n<p>He just bowed his head as a wordless &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>He took his time getting out of the Kitchens. He could see that Lord Eddard&rsquo;s daughter had managed to bring all the grains and resources she could. He heard whispers of the Lady of Winterfell, how she took care of her people. The movements in the Kitchens and in the Armory were a testament of that. <i>Who knew that little girl that once was Joffrey&rsquo;s plaything could become such a competent ruler</i>, he reflected. <i>It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, though. She learned how not to do things from the most incompetent monarchs in recent history&hellip; And Littlefinger</i>, he remembered. He heard whispers of him teaching her all he knows. <i>If it&rsquo;s true, that wouldn&rsquo;t only make her a competent ruler but also a skilled politician</i>. He dwelled on that thought for a while.</p>\n<p>He wandered a bit in the courtyard, watching the men and women train for the umpending battle against the dead. He saw Brienne of Tarth, commanding a small garrison of soldiers, teaching them all she could, given the little time they had. But the training of soldiers didn&rsquo;t capture his attention, the little She-Wolf did. He saw Lady Arya practice her shooting. All of the arrows she had fired had hit the bullseye. Just as he was turning his eyes to her again, he found her staring at him. She still had the bow tensed, the arrow ready to be fired. They locked eyes for mere seconds, but in those mere seconds she hit the bullseye yet again, all while glaring at him. Then, just as she arched an eyebrown, a small smug smile forming on her lips. He felt as if he had given her something. Unsettled, he bowed his head to her and left. He felt an incredibly strong need to be alone. <i>Things are not going as planned. The pups are wild beasts now. And we must act accordingly</i>, he thought.</p>\n<p>While making his way towards the Guest Keep, he saw Jon Snow all but run towards the Great Keep, with Winterfell&rsquo;s maester trying to keep up with him. He looked like a soldier, marching towards the battlefield. <i>A man with purpose</i>, he told himself. And again, the conversation he had with his brother came back to him. With all of this in mind, he headed towards his chambers.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;My dear friend&rdquo; Tyrion greeted him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was under the impression you wanted to have a few words with Jon Snow&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Tyrion grabbed a cup and started pouring some of the warmed Dornish red he had asked for, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a busy man&rdquo; he said before taking a long sip. &ldquo;But what about you? I came here to talk about our Queen, only to find an empty room&rdquo; he told him with fake dissapointment. &ldquo;Are you already weaving your little webs, Lord Varys?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You must have information, valuable information, in order to weave anything. And I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me, my friend, when I say that northmen aren&rsquo;t the sharing type&rdquo; pointed out the Spider. After this, silence surrounded them. He did the same as Tyrion; grabbed a cup and poured some Dornish red. The warmth of the drink relaxed him a bit; if he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend they were south of the Neck. Almost.</p>\n<p>They both had their missions. He had to find out any valuable information that would be useful, and Tyrion had to make the Starks understand the situation they were all dealing with, without offending anyone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Have you found anything?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing good. Turns out Jon Snow isn&rsquo;t as much of a fool as we all thought. His loyalties lie with the North and the Starks&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But then why is he-&rdquo; Tyrion stopped on his tracks as realization dawned on his face. &ldquo;He managed to bring her all this way North to fight alongside him&rdquo; he said while rubbing his neck. He opened his mouth to say something, but inmediately closed it. He jumped out of his chair and started pacing around the room. &ldquo;Do you realize what this means? One wrong look, one wrong word, and we&rsquo;re fucked&rdquo; he claimed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We can still salvage this alliance. She still believes him to be loyal to her&rdquo; Varys tried to appease his friend.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She believes him to be in love with her&rdquo; he claimed, while coming to a halt. He looked at Varys with pleading eyes, reminding him of something only the two of them knew. &ldquo;Did you found anything else?&rdquo; he sighed.</p>\n<p>Varys had his doubts about telling him about the rest of the conversation he overheard &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bring up an assumption and speak of it as if it were the truth&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must keep digging&rdquo;. He took a long sip of his cup. &ldquo;No. Not yet, at least&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Tyrion let out a long, heavy sigh. &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo; he said as he put his cup on the table and made his way to the door. &ldquo;Since the Warden of the North is busy, it seems I must talk to my Lady wife&rdquo; he jested.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the same girl we&rsquo;ve both seen at the Capital&rdquo; he reminded him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo; he replied, all humor gone from his voice, &ldquo;she made that perfectly clear the same day we arrived&rdquo; he declared, with a sour tone. He stood still, facing the door, but Varys knew Tyrion. He had more to say. He was right; Tyrion pivoted and took long steps towards him, as long as his legs would allow him. &ldquo;I think she knows about the Reach&rdquo; he confessed.</p>\n<p>This surprised Varys. &ldquo;You think she knows about what exactly?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;About the Tarlys?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tyrion just shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, all of it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How could she possibly know all of it?&rdquo; he wondered, &ldquo;news don&rsquo;t travel as fast during winter&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, somehow the Lady of Winterfell knows about what our Queen did&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is not good&rdquo; Varys pointed out. &ldquo;These Stark children are definetely not like their parents. More difficult to read, and even more difficul to handle&rdquo; he thought. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fucked, Varys. Sansa can say all those very convincing words, and Daenerys can choose to believe all of it&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that none of us are welcomed here. Not you, not me, and definetely not our Queen&rdquo; he went back to table and poured the rest of the Dornish red in his cup. After taking a very long sip, he continued &ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With whom?</p>\n<p>Tyrion sighed yet again. \"With all of them&rdquo; he said after putting down his cup. He marched towards the door, and when he opened it, the cold air of the North crep into the room.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fucking cold&rdquo; Tyrion muttered as he left.</p>\n<p>Finally, Varys was left alone. Alone with his thoughts, and other people&rsquo;s truths and secrets. <i>But it&rsquo;s not enough</i>, he reminded himself. &nbsp;He dwelled on these thoughts while eating his broth, until a hard knock echoed in the whole room.</p>\n<p>He opened the door and was surprised to see one of the Unsullied. &ldquo;Queen Daenerys requires your presence&rdquo; the warrior announced, his back straightened and his eyes looking at some fixed point behind Varys.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Very well&rdquo; he said to the young Unsullied.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n<br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>He found the young Targaryen queen looking at the snowy fields of the North through a window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, the North&rdquo; she said with some melancholy in her voice, still looking through the window. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is, Your Grace. Though it&rsquo;s far too cold for my liking&rdquo; he offered, politely.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As it is for me&rdquo; she replied, looking at him over her shoulder. &ldquo;Please, sit&rdquo; she gestured with her hand at the chairs that were by the hearth. Then she gave a single nod to the Unsullied. Now, they were alone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I guess I wasn&rsquo;t summoned to talk about the chilly winds of the North&rdquo; he said as he sat down. The firewood from the hearth were cackling, making little noises, yet as he seated close to it to fight the cold, he couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder&hellip;<i> How can something be there to protect you from something but also be a threat itself?</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, you were not&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I summoned you because I want to talk about the North&rdquo; she said as she seated across him by the hearth.</p>\n<p>The conversation he had with Tyrion earlier came back to his mind.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><i><b>&ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>&ldquo;With all of them&rdquo;</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b><br></b></i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know they don&rsquo;t want me&rdquo; Daenerys said, with a mix of sadness, dissapointment and anger tinting her voice.</p>\n<p>Varys only sighed. He knew she was far from over, that she needed to vent, so he let her. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not the North, not the lords and ladies, not Lady Sansa and her family\" she remarked, anger starting to show in her voice and features. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to save them, can&rsquo;t they see?&rdquo; She then looked at him with her beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with doubts. Eyes trying to mask a thunderstorm. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your Grace, the northmen are known for being proud. They just need a little more time. To get to know you&rdquo; he offered her. At his words, Daenerys seemed to relaxed a little, fixing her eyes in the fire. He took it as a sign to continue. &ldquo;You have to remember that the last memory they have of Targaryens are those of your father and eldest brother. They are not remembered fondly here&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The mention of her father and brother made her snapped her eyes back at him. &ldquo;And pray tell, Lord Varys, what do I have to do for the people of Westeros to realize I&rsquo;m not father nor my brother?&rdquo; she fumed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect them to forget the last two decades, my Queen. But you can show them that there is more to the Targaryen name than your father and brother&rdquo; he insisted. </p>\n<p>She returned her gaze to the flames. The way she seemed to be so enthralled by its dance reminded him of the red priestesses of R'hollor. Although the hearth gave the room some warmth, he still got chills.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will show them there is more to the Targaryen name&rdquo; she echoed, still looking at the flames. But a thought seemed to snap her out of its spell. &ldquo;What about the Starks?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jon has been avoiding me since we arrived. Lady Sansa is courteous, yet I can see the ice in her eyes&rdquo;. she said in an exasperated tone. &ldquo;How do you suggest I win over the Lady of Winterfell?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You are both women of power, maybe you can try by starting there. Maybe you can open up to her about your experiences in Essos, let her get to know you&rdquo; he proposed.</p>\n<p>She looked at him, with narrowed eyes, analyzing what he just said. Then, she turned her eyes to the flames again. &ldquo;What about Jon?&rdquo; she sighed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Lord Tyrion wasn&rsquo;t able to reach him this morning. Winterfell&rsquo;s maester said he was busy discussing some strategies on how to defeat the Night King with his brother and the Tarly boy&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If he was discussing strategies, weren&rsquo;t we suppossed to be ther-&rdquo; she complained, but stopped herself when realization dawned in her eyes. &ldquo;Did you say Tarly boy?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Samwell Tarly, Your Grace. Randyll Tarly&rsquo;s eldest son. He&rsquo;s a sworn brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. They tell me he&rsquo;s close friends with Jon Snow&rdquo; he explained. </p>\n<p>The implications of what he just told her didn&rsquo;t escape her. Her queenly mask was slowly coming off. Varys could only look at her. Enthralled by the flames, she just stood still. The flames made her eyes shine in a beautiful and disturbing way.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That will be all, Lord Varys&rdquo; she said, never taking her eyes from the fire. &ldquo;Thank you for your counsel&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>He respectfully bowed and walked out of her chambers as fast as propriety allowed. <i>She shouldn&rsquo;t be alone right now</i>, he thought. When he arrived to the entrance of the Guest Keep, he told one of the Dothraki posted there &ldquo;Go find Missandei of Naath. Tell her her Queen needs to speak to her&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>He hoped Missandei&rsquo;s friendship and presence would act like a balm to the Dragon Queen&rsquo;s strong passions.</p>\n",

Sansa can say all those very convincing words, and Daenerys can choose to believe all of it\u201d he scoffed. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that none of us are welcomed here. Not you, not me, and definetely not our Queen\u201d he went back to table and poured the rest of the Dornish red in his cup. After taking a very long sip, he continued \u201cWe have to be careful\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whom?</p><p>Tyrion sighed yet again. \"With all of them\u201d he said after putting down his cup. He marched towards the door, and when he opened it, the cold air of the North crep into the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so fucking cold\u201d Tyrion muttered as he left.</p><p>Finally, Varys was left alone. Alone with his thoughts, and other people\u2019s truths and secrets. <i>But it\u2019s not enough</i>, he reminded himself. \u00a0He dwelled on these thoughts while eating his broth, until a hard knock echoed in the whole room.</p><p>He opened the door and was surprised to see one of the Unsullied. \u201cQueen Daenerys requires your presence\u201d the warrior announced, his back straightened and his eyes looking at some fixed point behind Varys.</p><p>\u201cVery well\u201d he said to the young Unsullied.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n<br></p><p><br></p><p>He found the young Targaryen queen looking at the snowy fields of the North through a window. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place, the North\u201d she said with some melancholy in her voice, still looking through the window. </p><p>\u201cIt is, Your Grace. Though it\u2019s far too cold for my liking\u201d he offered, politely.</p><p>\u201cAs it is for me\u201d she replied, looking at him over her shoulder. \u201cPlease, sit\u201d she gestured with her hand at the chairs that were by the hearth. Then she gave a single nod to the Unsullied. Now, they were alone.</p><p>\u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t summoned to talk about the chilly winds of the North\u201d he said as he sat down. The firewood from the hearth were cackling, making little noises, yet as he seated close to it to fight the cold, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2026<i> How can something be there to protect you from something but also be a threat itself?</i></p><p>\u201cNo, you were not\u201d she agreed. \u201cI summoned you because I want to talk about the North\u201d she said as she seated across him by the hearth.</p><p>The conversation he had with Tyrion earlier came back to his mind.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWe have to be careful\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWith whom?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWith all of them\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p>\u201cI know they don\u2019t want me\u201d Daenerys said, with a mix of sadness, dissapointment and anger tinting her voice.</p><p>Varys only sighed. He knew she was far from over, that she needed to vent, so he let her. </p><p>\u201cNot the North, not the lords and ladies, not Lady Sansa and her family\" she remarked, anger starting to show in her voice and features. \u201cI\u2019m here to save them, can\u2019t they see?\u201d She then looked at him with her beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with doubts. Eyes trying to mask a thunderstorm. </p><p>\u201cYour Grace, the northmen are known for being proud. They just need a little more time. To get to know you\u201d he offered her. At his words, Daenerys seemed to relaxed a little, fixing her eyes in the fire. He took it as a sign to continue. \u201cYou have to remember that the last memory they have of Targaryens are those of your father and eldest brother. They are not remembered fondly here\u201d.</p><p>The mention of her father and brother made her snapped her eyes back at him. \u201cAnd pray tell, Lord Varys, what do I have to do for the people of Westeros to realize I\u2019m not father nor my brother?\u201d she fumed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect them to forget the last two decades, my Queen. But you can show them that there is more to the Targaryen name than your father and brother\u201d he insisted. </p><p>She returned her gaze to the flames. The way she seemed to be so enthralled by its dance reminded him of the red priestesses of R'hollor. Although the hearth gave the room some warmth, he still got chills.</p><p>\u201cI will show them there is more to the Targaryen name\u201d she echoed, still looking at the flames. But a thought seemed to snap her out of its spell. \u201cWhat about the Starks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon has been avoiding me since we arrived. Lady Sansa is courteous, yet I can see the ice in her eyes\u201d. she said in an exasperated tone. \u201cHow do you suggest I win over the Lady of Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are both women of power, maybe you can try by starting there. Maybe you can open up to her about your experiences in Essos, let her get to know you\u201d he proposed.</p><p>She looked at him, with narrowed eyes, analyzing what he just said. Then, she turned her eyes to the flames again. \u201cWhat about Jon?\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion wasn\u2019t able to reach him this morning. Winterfell\u2019s maester said he was busy discussing some strategies on how to defeat the Night King with his brother and the Tarly boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was discussing strategies, weren\u2019t we suppossed to be ther-\u201d she complained, but stopped herself when realization dawned in her eyes. \u201cDid you say Tarly boy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSamwell Tarly, Your Grace. Randyll Tarly\u2019s eldest son. He\u2019s a sworn brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. They tell me he\u2019s close friends with Jon Snow\u201d he explained. </p><p>The implications of what he just told her didn\u2019t escape her. Her queenly mask was slowly coming off. Varys could only look at her. Enthralled by the flames, she just stood still. The flames made her eyes shine in a beautiful and disturbing way.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all, Lord Varys\u201d she said, never taking her eyes from the fire. \u201cThank you for your counsel\u201d.</p><p>He respectfully bowed and walked out of her chambers as fast as propriety allowed. <i>She shouldn\u2019t be alone right now</i>, he thought. When he arrived to the entrance of the Guest Keep, he told one of the Dothraki posted there \u201cGo find Missandei of Naath. Tell her her Queen needs to speak to her\u201d.</p><p>He hoped Missandei\u2019s friendship and presence would act like a balm to the Dragon Queen\u2019s strong passions.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>He was in the Kitchens, eating some hot broth, when a young maid came to him. He had asked his little birds to fly around the Wolves\u2019 castle, looking for anything that might be useful. Most of them came empty-handed. But this young maid, Darla, she was one of the good ones.</p><p>\u201cM'lord, this is all I could find\u201d she said as she handed \u00a0him a piece of paper. \u201cI tried to write as fast as I could\u201d she explained.</p><p>Varys opened the piece of paper and read it, but he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. He reread what Darla had written. \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chambers of that man from the Night\u2019s Watch. It was in an old book\u201d the young maid looked at him with impatient eyes. \u201cSo, is it any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea, young girl\u201d he told her as he gave her five gold dragons. At this, the young woman nodded and mouthed a \u201cthank you\u201d and left as fast as she could.</p><p>Now, the conversation between Bran Stark and Jon Snow made more sense. <i>This changes everything</i>, he thought. And his mind filled with those familiar doubts, but now they found a new partner in some treasonous thoughts. </p><p><br></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\n<br></p><p><br></p><p>Varys liked the view from the battlements. The view of the vast snowy fields surrounding Winterfell could be an image that brought him peace and comfort; but given the threat of eternal winter, the view made him as if were staring at the flames, like he did all those years ago. He let out a heavy sigh, the cold air making it visible.<i> If only I could see things like I see this</i>, he reflected,<i> then maybe I could make my move</i>.</p><p>He remembered Littlefinger, then. Always eager to make his move, one that drive him forward, closer to his goal. <i>And because he\u2019s always so eager he leaves chaos in his wake. Chaos that loves to prey on others</i>, he thought. He remembered what Lady Sansa has said about him during the welcoming feast. \u201c<i>He went to the Vale, to oversee some things regarding the food</i>\u201d Ned Stark\u2019s daughter has said. But he knew Petyr Baelish, he knew him very well, and it was not like him to miss such an opportunity like this. <i>He\u2019s the master of chaos, and a Targaryen in Winterfell would be just the kind of situation he would like to exploit</i>. Maybe Lady Sansa was telling the truth. <i>But if it is the turth she was saying, that means she has power over him. And to have power over someone like Littlefinger\u2026</i></p><p>His thoughts were interrumpted by the sound of someone approaching him. He turned around to find Ser Davos Seaworth. The man was a loyal and trusted advisor of Jon Snow. <i>Maybe he can give me some insight of what\u2019s Winterfell like under the rule of Eddard Stark\u2019s children</i>, he thought.</p><p>\"Ser Davos\u201d he greeted him with a light bow.</p><p>\u201cLord Varys\u201d he said, with some surprise. \u201cI\u2019ll say I didn\u2019t expect you to find out here. It\u2019s freezing cold\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust admiring what the North has to offer, ser\u201d he replied, returning his eyes to vast fields covered in snow.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot to admire, I\u2019d say. But we don\u2019t get to see this much snow on the South, so I think there is some beauty in it\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here? Like you said, it\u2019s freezing cold\u201d he asked</p><p>\u201cWar council. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to make best use of the battlements and the high grounds. We must use any advantage we have\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a military man, I do not understand the art of war\u201d he admitted \u201cbut if there\u2019s a war council being held soon, let me know so I can inform our Queen\u201d</p><p>Davos Seaworth turned his head to him when he said our Queen. He was one of the very few that knew that Jon Snow was no longer King in the North. <i>Hopefully, it stays like that until the North warms up to Daenerys</i>, he thought.</p><p>Just as he turned his head to him, he turned it back to the fields. But they didn\u2019t capture his attention, since he turned his head back at him again, his eyes narrowed. \u201cMay I ask you a question, Lord Varys?\u201d He nodded in response. \u201cWhy do you serve Daenerys Targaryen?\u201d</p><p>Varys smiled at the bold man. \u201cShe\u2019s not like any other ruler the Seven Kingdoms have seen\u201d he offered. A nice, short and safe answer.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe has dragons, but I guess that makes her like her ancestors\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried she might be like some of them? Like the worst of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider me a subject interested in his new Queen. You see, Lord Varys, while Jon and I were in Dragonstone, we didn\u2019t get the chance to know much about her\u201d he replied</p><p>\u201cA wasted opportunity, I know. I advised her to let her people know her. I believe that will bring peace of mind to many\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But northerners are tough, they\u2019re loyal to their own\u201d he argued. A small laugh left his lips after he said this, it was as if he was remembering something. \u201cYou don\u2019t earn their trust easily. It took me a long time and a bloody battle for me to earn the trust of many around here\u201d.</p><p>\u201cShe will make a good Queen, ser Davos. You have my word\u201d</p><p>Ser Davos chuckled at his answer. \u201cCan I be honest with you, Lord Varys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways\u201d he said, with a little bow</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your word they need. Like you said, they don\u2019t know her, and for them to accept her would take time\u201d he confided. \u201cBut time is something we don\u2019t have. I hope Queen Daenerys earns the North\u2019s trust. I really do\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s best for the realm, dear ser\u201d he assured him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she doesn\u2019t? What happens then?\u201d He had his narrowed eyes fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope she does earn their trust, ser Davos\u201d he replied, the answer he really wanted to give him hidden in the words he said.</p><p>Davos Seaworth\u2019s narrowed eyes now widened. He seemed to understand what he meant to say. He took a deep breath while staring at the white snowed fields surrounding the castle, \u201cLet\u2019s hope she does\u201d he echoed. After a few moments of silent meditation, ser Davos turned to him once more. \u201cLord Varys\u201d he said as a goodbye.</p><p>He just nodded. The words of the onion knight echoed in his mind. Whether someone sent him or not, one thing was clear. Daenerys wasn\u2019t wanted here. Not as Queen, anyways. The North seemed very content with Sansa Stark as Lady of Winterfell and Jon Snow as their King. <i>A great pair</i>, he thought, <i>a most capable politician and a renowned warrior</i>. He let out a long sigh. He knew what this meant. <i>The Queen doesn\u2019t handle rejection very well, what happened at the Reach is testament of that</i>, he reflected. He decided he had enough of the winter winds for one day and headed to the Great Keep, looking for the only person able to appease the people.</p><p>He walked across the courtyard, where many men, women and children old enough to fight were training. Some with sword, others with bow and arrow. There were even some with spears, being trained by Greyworm. As he walked, he wondered how many people would die fighting for the living. <i>Let\u2019s just hope we win, otherwise it would\u2019ve been all for nothing</i>. </p><p>When he arrived at his destination, he took a deep breath to give himself some courage. <i>Give some in order to get some</i>, he reminded himself. <i>That\u2019s what this is about. Information</i>.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, m'lord?\u201d a northern man, no more than three-and-twenty, asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d like to talk to Lady Stark\u201d he replied. He could see the anxiety in the young man\u2019s eyes. <i>Sansa Stark is not one to inspire fear. Something must\u2019ve happened.</i></p><p>\u201cWait here, m'lord\u201d. After that, the young northman entered Lady Sansa\u2019s solar. A few minutes passed until the guard came out. \u201cLady Sansa is waiting for you inside, m'lord\u201d the young man said with a light bow of his head.</p><p>As soon as the heavy wooden doors closed, Sansa Stark stood up. \u201cLord Varys, I didn\u2019t expect you to see you so soon\u201d she said, not as the little lady he remembered from King\u2019s Landing, but as Lady of a great castle.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid, my Lady, we weren\u2019t able to finish our conversation\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we did\u201d she said as she approached him. \u201cYou were very clear on your stance, Lord Varys, and I like to believe I was very clear on mine\u201d she continued. \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing left to discuss\u201d.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Lady Sansa\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not our last conversation that brought me here today\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it that brought you here today, Lord Varys?\u201d she asked, her face relaxed, but with ice in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour family. And the future of Westeros\u201d he stated.</p><p>And at that, Sansa Stark gave him her full attention.</p>",

But Winterfell was a big castle, full of thick and warm walls that could shield you from the winter. There was a hidden little spot, just between the Library Tower and the Kitchens, perfect for a shadow to blend in with the great grey walls. </p><p>\u201c<i>Why did you bend the knee?</i>\u201d he heard the Stark boy ask the newly appointed Warden of the North.</p><p>\u201c<i>To protect the North</i>\u201d Jon Snow replied, quickly and firmly. </p><p>One of his fears was now confirmed. <i>Winterfell\u2019s Bastard is playing the game. A dangerous game,</i>\u00a0he thought with surprise in his mind and fear in his heart. <i>Nothing good can come out of a fight between the Dragon and the pack of Wolves</i>. His thoughts were turning somber at great speed.</p><p>\u201c<i>And why do you feel like you have to protect it?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Because it\u2019s my duty, It\u2019s always been. Ever since I swore an oath</i>\u201d \u00a0he heard Jon Snow say. <i>His duty lies with his family and with his people. Like everyone in this realm\u2026 but he mentioned his oath</i>, he reflected.</p><p>\u201c<i>And that duty, that desire to protect the North, where does it come from?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I protect it because it\u2019s my home, a part of me</i>\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Your home, and you love it. Sometimes, duty and love go hand in hand, but sometimes, we must choose between one and the other. Father chose both, his love was with your mother, as same as his duty. Robb chose love, forsaking his duty. Jon, you\u2019ve chosen duty over love so many times. You have the chance to choose love, now</i>\u201d. What the youngest son of Ned Stark said left him wondering. </p><p>\u201cHis love was with your mother\u2026\u201d he repeated that over and over in his head. Lord Eddard Stark never said the name of his bastard\u2019s mother. Some said it was a lowborn woman, others said it was Ashara Dayne, but no one had a definitive answer. Why would Eddard Stark\u2019s love and duty lie with a mysterious woman, when he was a devoted husband to Catelyn Tully, when it was known that there was love in their marriage? He had heard of the time when Lady Stark had visited the capital, a lifetime ago\u2026 He felt as if he was looking at some forbidden image, without being able to decipher its meaning.</p><p>\u201c<i>But what about my duty? What about Daenerys?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Everthing will work out the way it\u2019s supposed to</i>\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>The sound of the dragons flying over the castle broke him from his thoughts. He took it as a sign that it was time for him to leave.</p><p>He headed towards the Kitchens, trying to look incospicous. He asked one of the maids to bring him some warmed dornish red, along with some broth.</p><p>\u201cAlright, m'lord. It\u2019ll be in your room in a moment\u201d said the young maid. </p><p>He just bowed his head as a wordless \u201cthank you\u201d.</p><p>He took his time getting out of the Kitchens. He could see that Lord Eddard\u2019s daughter had managed to bring all the grains and resources she could. He heard whispers of the Lady of Winterfell, how she took care of her people. The movements in the Kitchens and in the Armory were a testament of that. <i>Who knew that little girl that once was Joffrey\u2019s plaything could become such a competent ruler</i>, he reflected. <i>It shouldn\u2019t be surprising, though. She learned how not to do things from the most incompetent monarchs in recent history\u2026 And Littlefinger</i>, he remembered. He heard whispers of him teaching her all he knows. <i>If it\u2019s true, that wouldn\u2019t only make her a competent ruler but also a skilled politician</i>. He dwelled on that thought for a while.</p><p>He wandered a bit in the courtyard, watching the men and women train for the umpending battle against the dead. He saw Brienne of Tarth, commanding a small garrison of soldiers, teaching them all she could, given the little time they had. But the training of soldiers didn\u2019t capture his attention, the little She-Wolf did. He saw Lady Arya practice her shooting. All of the arrows she had fired had hit the bullseye. Just as he was turning his eyes to her again, he found her staring at him. She still had the bow tensed, the arrow ready to be fired. They locked eyes for mere seconds, but in those mere seconds she hit the bullseye yet again, all while glaring at him. Then, just as she arched an eyebrown, a small smug smile forming on her lips. He felt as if he had given her something. Unsettled, he bowed his head to her and left. He felt an incredibly strong need to be alone. <i>Things are not going as planned. The pups are wild beasts now. And we must act accordingly</i>, he thought.</p><p>While making his way towards the Guest Keep, he saw Jon Snow all but run towards the Great Keep, with Winterfell\u2019s maester trying to keep up with him. He looked like a soldier, marching towards the battlefield. <i>A man with purpose</i>, he told himself. And again, the conversation he had with his brother came back to him. With all of this in mind, he headed towards his chambers.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy dear friend\u201d Tyrion greeted him.</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression you wanted to have a few words with Jon Snow\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Tyrion grabbed a cup and started pouring some of the warmed Dornish red he had asked for, \u201cI think he\u2019s a busy man\u201d he said before taking a long sip. \u201cBut what about you? I came here to talk about our Queen, only to find an empty room\u201d he told him with fake dissapointment. \u201cAre you already weaving your little webs, Lord Varys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have information, valuable information, in order to weave anything. And I think you\u2019ll agree with me, my friend, when I say that northmen aren\u2019t the sharing type\u201d pointed out the Spider. After this, silence surrounded them. He did the same as Tyrion; grabbed a cup and poured some Dornish red. The warmth of the drink relaxed him a bit; if he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend they were south of the Neck. Almost.</p><p>They both had their missions. He had to find out any valuable information that would be useful, and Tyrion had to make the Starks understand the situation they were all dealing with, without offending anyone.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 Have you found anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing good. Turns out Jon Snow isn\u2019t as much of a fool as we all thought. His loyalties lie with the North and the Starks\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then why is he-\u201d Tyrion stopped on his tracks as realization dawned on his face. \u201cHe managed to bring her all this way North to fight alongside him\u201d he said while rubbing his neck. He opened his mouth to say something, but inmediately closed it. He jumped out of his chair and started pacing around the room. \u201cDo you realize what this means? One wrong look, one wrong word, and we\u2019re fucked\u201d he claimed.</p><p>\u201cWe can still salvage this alliance. She still believes him to be loyal to her\u201d Varys tried to appease his friend.</p><p>\u201cShe believes him to be in love with her\u201d he claimed, while coming to a halt. He looked at Varys with pleading eyes, reminding him of something only the two of them knew. \u201cDid you found anything else?\u201d he sighed.</p><p>Varys had his doubts about telling him about the rest of the conversation he overheard \u201cI can\u2019t bring up an assumption and speak of it as if it were the truth\u201d he thought. \u201cI must keep digging\u201d. He took a long sip of his cup. \u201cNo. Not yet, at least\u201d.</p><p>Tyrion let out a long, heavy sigh. \u201cWell, then\u201d he said as he put his cup on the table and made his way to the door. \u201cSince the Warden of the North is busy, it seems I must talk to my Lady wife\u201d he jested.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not the same girl we\u2019ve both seen at the Capital\u201d he reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d he replied, all humor gone from his voice, \u201cshe made that perfectly clear the same day we arrived\u201d he declared, with a sour tone. He stood still, facing the door, but Varys knew Tyrion. He had more to say. He was right; Tyrion pivoted and took long steps towards him, as long as his legs would allow him. \u201cI think she knows about the Reach\u201d he confessed.</p><p>This surprised Varys. \u201cYou think she knows about what exactly?\u201d he inquired. \u201cAbout the Tarlys?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion just shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, all of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she possibly know all of it?\u201d he wondered, \u201cnews don\u2019t travel as fast during winter\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWell, somehow the Lady of Winterfell knows about what our Queen did\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cThis is not good\u201d Varys pointed out. \u201cThese Stark children are definetely not like their parents. More difficult to read, and even more difficul to handle\u201d he thought. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fucked, Varys. Sansa can say all those very convincing words, and Daenerys can choose to believe all of it\u201d he scoffed. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that none of us are welcomed here. Not you, not me, and definetely not our Queen\u201d he went back to table and poured the rest of the Dornish red in his cup. After taking a very long sip, he continued \u201cWe have to be careful\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whom?</p><p>Tyrion sighed yet again. \"With all of them\u201d he said after putting down his cup. He marched towards the door, and when he opened it, the cold air of the North crep into the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so fucking cold\u201d Tyrion muttered as he left.</p><p>Finally, Varys was left alone. Alone with his thoughts, and other people\u2019s truths and secrets. <i>But it\u2019s not enough</i>, he reminded himself. \u00a0He dwelled on these thoughts while eating his broth, until a hard knock echoed in the whole room.</p><p>He opened the door and was surprised to see one of the Unsullied. \u201cQueen Daenerys requires your presence\u201d the warrior announced, his back straightened and his eyes looking at some fixed point behind Varys.</p><p>\u201cVery well\u201d he said to the young Unsullied.</p><p><br></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n<br></p><p><br></p><p>He found the young Targaryen queen looking at the snowy fields of the North through a window. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place, the North\u201d she said with some melancholy in her voice, still looking through the window. </p><p>\u201cIt is, Your Grace. Though it\u2019s far too cold for my liking\u201d he offered, politely.</p><p>\u201cAs it is for me\u201d she replied, looking at him over her shoulder. \u201cPlease, sit\u201d she gestured with her hand at the chairs that were by the hearth. Then she gave a single nod to the Unsullied. Now, they were alone.</p><p>\u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t summoned to talk about the chilly winds of the North\u201d he said as he sat down. The firewood from the hearth were cackling, making little noises, yet as he seated close to it to fight the cold, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2026<i> How can something be there to protect you from something but also be a threat itself?</i></p><p>\u201cNo, you were not\u201d she agreed. \u201cI summoned you because I want to talk about the North\u201d she said as she seated across him by the hearth.</p><p>The conversation he had with Tyrion earlier came back to his mind.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWe have to be careful\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWith whom?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWith all of them\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p>\u201cI know they don\u2019t want me\u201d Daenerys said, with a mix of sadness, dissapointment and anger tinting her voice.</p><p>Varys only sighed. He knew she was far from over, that she needed to vent, so he let her. </p><p>\u201cNot the North, not the lords and ladies, not Lady Sansa and her family\" she remarked, anger starting to show in her voice and features. \u201cI\u2019m here to save them, can\u2019t they see?\u201d She then looked at him with her beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with doubts. Eyes trying to mask a thunderstorm. </p><p>\u201cYour Grace, the northmen are known for being proud. They just need a little more time. To get to know you\u201d he offered her. At his words, Daenerys seemed to relaxed a little, fixing her eyes in the fire. He took it as a sign to continue. \u201cYou have to remember that the last memory they have of Targaryens are those of your father and eldest brother. They are not remembered fondly here\u201d.</p><p>The mention of her father and brother made her snapped her eyes back at him. \u201cAnd pray tell, Lord Varys, what do I have to do for the people of Westeros to realize I\u2019m not father nor my brother?\u201d she fumed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect them to forget the last two decades, my Queen. But you can show them that there is more to the Targaryen name than your father and brother\u201d he insisted. </p><p>She returned her gaze to the flames. The way she seemed to be so enthralled by its dance reminded him of the red priestesses of R'hollor. Although the hearth gave the room some warmth, he still got chills.</p><p>\u201cI will show them there is more to the Targaryen name\u201d she echoed, still looking at the flames. But a thought seemed to snap her out of its spell. \u201cWhat about the Starks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon has been avoiding me since we arrived. Lady Sansa is courteous, yet I can see the ice in her eyes\u201d. she said in an exasperated tone. \u201cHow do you suggest I win over the Lady of Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are both women of power, maybe you can try by starting there. Maybe you can open up to her about your experiences in Essos, let her get to know you\u201d he proposed.</p><p>She looked at him, with narrowed eyes, analyzing what he just said. Then, she turned her eyes to the flames again. \u201cWhat about Jon?\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion wasn\u2019t able to reach him this morning. Winterfell\u2019s maester said he was busy discussing some strategies on how to defeat the Night King with his brother and the Tarly boy\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was discussing strategies, weren\u2019t we suppossed to be ther-\u201d she complained, but stopped herself when realization dawned in her eyes. \u201cDid you say Tarly boy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSamwell Tarly, Your Grace. Randyll Tarly\u2019s eldest son. He\u2019s a sworn brother of the Night\u2019s Watch. They tell me he\u2019s close friends with Jon Snow\u201d he explained. </p><p>The implications of what he just told her didn\u2019t escape her. Her queenly mask was slowly coming off. Varys could only look at her. Enthralled by the flames, she just stood still. The flames made her eyes shine in a beautiful and disturbing way.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all, Lord Varys\u201d she said, never taking her eyes from the fire. \u201cThank you for your counsel\u201d.</p><p>He respectfully bowed and walked out of her chambers as fast as propriety allowed. <i>She shouldn\u2019t be alone right now</i>, he thought. When he arrived to the entrance of the Guest Keep, he told one of the Dothraki posted there \u201cGo find Missandei of Naath. Tell her her Queen needs to speak to her\u201d.</p><p>He hoped Missandei\u2019s friendship and presence would act like a balm to the Dragon Queen\u2019s strong passions.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>He was in the Kitchens, eating some hot broth, when a young maid came to him. He had asked his little birds to fly around the Wolves\u2019 castle, looking for anything that might be useful. Most of them came empty-handed. But this young maid, Darla, she was one of the good ones.</p><p>\u201cM'lord, this is all I could find\u201d she said as she handed \u00a0him a piece of paper. \u201cI tried to write as fast as I could\u201d she explained.</p><p>Varys opened the piece of paper and read it, but he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. He reread what Darla had written. \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chambers of that man from the Night\u2019s Watch. It was in an old book\u201d the young maid looked at him with impatient eyes. \u201cSo, is it any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea, young girl\u201d he told her as he gave her five gold dragons. At this, the young woman nodded and mouthed a \u201cthank you\u201d and left as fast as she could.</p><p>Now, the conversation between Bran Stark and Jon Snow made more sense. <i>This changes everything</i>, he thought. And his mind filled with those familiar doubts, but now they found a new partner in some treasonous thoughts. </p><p><br></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\n<br></p><p><br></p><p>Varys liked the view from the battlements. The view of the vast snowy fields surrounding Winterfell could be an image that brought him peace and comfort; but given the threat of eternal winter, the view made him as if were staring at the flames, like he did all those years ago. He let out a heavy sigh, the cold air making it visible.<i> If only I could see things like I see this</i>, he reflected,<i> then maybe I could make my move</i>.</p><p>He remembered Littlefinger, then. Always eager to make his move, one that drive him forward, closer to his goal. <i>And because he\u2019s always so eager he leaves chaos in his wake. Chaos that loves to prey on others</i>, he thought. He remembered what Lady Sansa has said about him during the welcoming feast. \u201c<i>He went to the Vale, to oversee some things regarding the food</i>\u201d Ned Stark\u2019s daughter has said. But he knew Petyr Baelish, he knew him very well, and it was not like him to miss such an opportunity like this. <i>He\u2019s the master of chaos, and a Targaryen in Winterfell would be just the kind of situation he would like to exploit</i>. Maybe Lady Sansa was telling the truth. <i>But if it is the turth she was saying, that means she has power over him. And to have power over someone like Littlefinger\u2026</i></p><p>His thoughts were interrumpted by the sound of someone approaching him. He turned around to find Ser Davos Seaworth. The man was a loyal and trusted advisor of Jon Snow. <i>Maybe he can give me some insight of what\u2019s Winterfell like under the rule of Eddard Stark\u2019s children</i>, he thought.</p><p>\"Ser Davos\u201d he greeted him with a light bow.</p><p>\u201cLord Varys\u201d he said, with some surprise. \u201cI\u2019ll say I didn\u2019t expect you to find out here. It\u2019s freezing cold\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust admiring what the North has to offer, ser\u201d he replied, returning his eyes to vast fields covered in snow.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot to admire, I\u2019d say. But we don\u2019t get to see this much snow on the South, so I think there is some beauty in it\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here? Like you said, it\u2019s freezing cold\u201d he asked</p><p>\u201cWar council. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to make best use of the battlements and the high grounds. We must use any advantage we have\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a military man, I do not understand the art of war\u201d he admitted \u201cbut if there\u2019s a war council being held soon, let me know so I can inform our Queen\u201d</p><p>Davos Seaworth turned his head to him when he said our Queen. He was one of the very few that knew that Jon Snow was no longer King in the North. <i>Hopefully, it stays like that until the North warms up to Daenerys</i>, he thought.</p><p>Just as he turned his head to him, he turned it back to the fields. But they didn\u2019t capture his attention, since he turned his head back at him again, his eyes narrowed. \u201cMay I ask you a question, Lord Varys?\u201d He nodded in response. \u201cWhy do you serve Daenerys Targaryen?\u201d</p><p>Varys smiled at the bold man. \u201cShe\u2019s not like any other ruler the Seven Kingdoms have seen\u201d he offered. A nice, short and safe answer.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe has dragons, but I guess that makes her like her ancestors\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried she might be like some of them? Like the worst of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider me a subject interested in his new Queen. You see, Lord Varys, while Jon and I were in Dragonstone, we didn\u2019t get the chance to know much about her\u201d he replied</p><p>\u201cA wasted opportunity, I know. I advised her to let her people know her. I believe that will bring peace of mind to many\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But northerners are tough, they\u2019re loyal to their own\u201d he argued. A small laugh left his lips after he said this, it was as if he was remembering something. \u201cYou don\u2019t earn their trust easily. It took me a long time and a bloody battle for me to earn the trust of many around here\u201d.</p><p>\u201cShe will make a good Queen, ser Davos. You have my word\u201d</p><p>Ser Davos chuckled at his answer. \u201cCan I be honest with you, Lord Varys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways\u201d he said, with a little bow</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your word they need. Like you said, they don\u2019t know her, and for them to accept her would take time\u201d he confided. \u201cBut time is something we don\u2019t have. I hope Queen Daenerys earns the North\u2019s trust. I really do\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s best for the realm, dear ser\u201d he assured him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she doesn\u2019t? What happens then?\u201d He had his narrowed eyes fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope she does earn their trust, ser Davos\u201d he replied, the answer he really wanted to give him hidden in the words he said.</p><p>Davos Seaworth\u2019s narrowed eyes now widened. He seemed to understand what he meant to say. He took a deep breath while staring at the white snowed fields surrounding the castle, \u201cLet\u2019s hope she does\u201d he echoed. After a few moments of silent meditation, ser Davos turned to him once more. \u201cLord Varys\u201d he said as a goodbye.</p><p>He just nodded. The words of the onion knight echoed in his mind. Whether someone sent him or not, one thing was clear. Daenerys wasn\u2019t wanted here. Not as Queen, anyways. The North seemed very content with Sansa Stark as Lady of Winterfell and Jon Snow as their King. <i>A great pair</i>, he thought, <i>a most capable politician and a renowned warrior</i>. He let out a long sigh. He knew what this meant. <i>The Queen doesn\u2019t handle rejection very well, what happened at the Reach is testament of that</i>, he reflected. He decided he had enough of the winter winds for one day and headed to the Great Keep, looking for the only person able to appease the people.</p><p>He walked across the courtyard, where many men, women and children old enough to fight were training. Some with sword, others with bow and arrow. There were even some with spears, being trained by Greyworm. As he walked, he wondered how many people would die fighting for the living. <i>Let\u2019s just hope we win, otherwise it would\u2019ve been all for nothing</i>. </p><p>When he arrived at his destination, he took a deep breath to give himself some courage. <i>Give some in order to get some</i>, he reminded himself. <i>That\u2019s what this is about. Information</i>.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, m'lord?\u201d a northern man, no more than three-and-twenty, asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d like to talk to Lady Stark\u201d he replied. He could see the anxiety in the young man\u2019s eyes. <i>Sansa Stark is not one to inspire fear. Something must\u2019ve happened.</i></p><p>\u201cWait here, m'lord\u201d. After that, the young northman entered Lady Sansa\u2019s solar. A few minutes passed until the guard came out. \u201cLady Sansa is waiting for you inside, m'lord\u201d the young man said with a light bow of his head.</p><p>As soon as the heavy wooden doors closed, Sansa Stark stood up. \u201cLord Varys, I didn\u2019t expect you to see you so soon\u201d she said, not as the little lady he remembered from King\u2019s Landing, but as Lady of a great castle.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid, my Lady, we weren\u2019t able to finish our conversation\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we did\u201d she said as she approached him. \u201cYou were very clear on your stance, Lord Varys, and I like to believe I was very clear on mine\u201d she continued. \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing left to discuss\u201d.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Lady Sansa\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not our last conversation that brought me here today\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it that brought you here today, Lord Varys?\u201d she asked, her face relaxed, but with ice in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour family. And the future of Westeros\u201d he stated.</p><p>And at that, Sansa Stark gave him her full attention.</p>",

His thoughts were turning somber at great speed.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>And why do you feel like you have to protect it?</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Because it&rsquo;s my duty, It&rsquo;s always been. Ever since I swore an oath</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;he heard Jon Snow say. <i>His duty lies with his family and with his people. Like everyone in this realm&hellip; but he mentioned his oath</i>, he reflected.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>And that duty, that desire to protect the North, where does it come from?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I protect it because it&rsquo;s my home, a part of me</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Your home, and you love it. Sometimes, duty and love go hand in hand, but sometimes, we must choose between one and the other. Father chose both, his love was with your mother, as same as his duty. Robb chose love, forsaking his duty. Jon, you&rsquo;ve chosen duty over love so many times. You have the chance to choose love, now</i>&rdquo;. What the youngest son of Ned Stark said left him wondering. </p><p>&ldquo;His love was with your mother&hellip;&rdquo; he repeated that over and over in his head. Lord Eddard Stark never said the name of his bastard&rsquo;s mother. Some said it was a lowborn woman, others said it was Ashara Dayne, but no one had a definitive answer. Why would Eddard Stark&rsquo;s love and duty lie with a mysterious woman, when he was a devoted husband to Catelyn Tully, when it was known that there was love in their marriage? He had heard of the time when Lady Stark had visited the capital, a lifetime ago&hellip; He felt as if he was looking at some forbidden image, without being able to decipher its meaning.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>But what about my duty? What about Daenerys?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Everthing will work out the way it&rsquo;s supposed to</i>&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>The sound of the dragons flying over the castle broke him from his thoughts. He took it as a sign that it was time for him to leave.</p><p>He headed towards the Kitchens, trying to look incospicous. He asked one of the maids to bring him some warmed dornish red, along with some broth.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, m'lord. It&rsquo;ll be in your room in a moment&rdquo; said the young maid. </p><p>He just bowed his head as a wordless &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.</p><p>He took his time getting out of the Kitchens. He could see that Lord Eddard&rsquo;s daughter had managed to bring all the grains and resources she could. He heard whispers of the Lady of Winterfell, how she took care of her people. The movements in the Kitchens and in the Armory were a testament of that. <i>Who knew that little girl that once was Joffrey&rsquo;s plaything could become such a competent ruler</i>, he reflected. <i>It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, though. She learned how not to do things from the most incompetent monarchs in recent history&hellip; And Littlefinger</i>, he remembered. He heard whispers of him teaching her all he knows. <i>If it&rsquo;s true, that wouldn&rsquo;t only make her a competent ruler but also a skilled politician</i>. He dwelled on that thought for a while.</p><p>He wandered a bit in the courtyard, watching the men and women train for the umpending battle against the dead. He saw Brienne of Tarth, commanding a small garrison of soldiers, teaching them all she could, given the little time they had. But the training of soldiers didn&rsquo;t capture his attention, the little She-Wolf did. He saw Lady Arya practice her shooting. All of the arrows she had fired had hit the bullseye. Just as he was turning his eyes to her again, he found her staring at him. She still had the bow tensed, the arrow ready to be fired. They locked eyes for mere seconds, but in those mere seconds she hit the bullseye yet again, all while glaring at him. Then, just as she arched an eyebrown, a small smug smile forming on her lips. He felt as if he had given her something. Unsettled, he bowed his head to her and left. He felt an incredibly strong need to be alone. <i>Things are not going as planned. The pups are wild beasts now. And we must act accordingly</i>, he thought.</p><p>While making his way towards the Guest Keep, he saw Jon Snow all but run towards the Great Keep, with Winterfell&rsquo;s maester trying to keep up with him. He looked like a soldier, marching towards the battlefield. <i>A man with purpose</i>, he told himself. And again, the conversation he had with his brother came back to him. With all of this in mind, he headed towards his chambers.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;My dear friend&rdquo; Tyrion greeted him.</p><p>&ldquo;I was under the impression you wanted to have a few words with Jon Snow&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Tyrion grabbed a cup and started pouring some of the warmed Dornish red he had asked for, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a busy man&rdquo; he said before taking a long sip. &ldquo;But what about you? I came here to talk about our Queen, only to find an empty room&rdquo; he told him with fake dissapointment. &ldquo;Are you already weaving your little webs, Lord Varys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must have information, valuable information, in order to weave anything. And I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me, my friend, when I say that northmen aren&rsquo;t the sharing type&rdquo; pointed out the Spider. After this, silence surrounded them. He did the same as Tyrion; grabbed a cup and poured some Dornish red. The warmth of the drink relaxed him a bit; if he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend they were south of the Neck. Almost.</p><p>They both had their missions. He had to find out any valuable information that would be useful, and Tyrion had to make the Starks understand the situation they were all dealing with, without offending anyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Have you found anything?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing good. Turns out Jon Snow isn&rsquo;t as much of a fool as we all thought. His loyalties lie with the North and the Starks&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But then why is he-&rdquo; Tyrion stopped on his tracks as realization dawned on his face. &ldquo;He managed to bring her all this way North to fight alongside him&rdquo; he said while rubbing his neck. He opened his mouth to say something, but inmediately closed it. He jumped out of his chair and started pacing around the room. &ldquo;Do you realize what this means? One wrong look, one wrong word, and we&rsquo;re fucked&rdquo; he claimed.</p><p>&ldquo;We can still salvage this alliance. She still believes him to be loyal to her&rdquo; Varys tried to appease his friend.</p><p>&ldquo;She believes him to be in love with her&rdquo; he claimed, while coming to a halt. He looked at Varys with pleading eyes, reminding him of something only the two of them knew. &ldquo;Did you found anything else?&rdquo; he sighed.</p><p>Varys had his doubts about telling him about the rest of the conversation he overheard &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bring up an assumption and speak of it as if it were the truth&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must keep digging&rdquo;. He took a long sip of his cup. &ldquo;No. Not yet, at least&rdquo;.</p><p>Tyrion let out a long, heavy sigh. &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo; he said as he put his cup on the table and made his way to the door. &ldquo;Since the Warden of the North is busy, it seems I must talk to my Lady wife&rdquo; he jested.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the same girl we&rsquo;ve both seen at the Capital&rdquo; he reminded him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo; he replied, all humor gone from his voice, &ldquo;she made that perfectly clear the same day we arrived&rdquo; he declared, with a sour tone. He stood still, facing the door, but Varys knew Tyrion. He had more to say. He was right; Tyrion pivoted and took long steps towards him, as long as his legs would allow him. &ldquo;I think she knows about the Reach&rdquo; he confessed.</p><p>This surprised Varys. &ldquo;You think she knows about what exactly?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;About the Tarlys?&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion just shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, all of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could she possibly know all of it?&rdquo; he wondered, &ldquo;news don&rsquo;t travel as fast during winter&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, somehow the Lady of Winterfell knows about what our Queen did&rdquo; he noted.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not good&rdquo; Varys pointed out. &ldquo;These Stark children are definetely not like their parents. More difficult to read, and even more difficul to handle&rdquo; he thought. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fucked, Varys. Sansa can say all those very convincing words, and Daenerys can choose to believe all of it&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that none of us are welcomed here. Not you, not me, and definetely not our Queen&rdquo; he went back to table and poured the rest of the Dornish red in his cup. After taking a very long sip, he continued &ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With whom?</p><p>Tyrion sighed yet again. \"With all of them&rdquo; he said after putting down his cup. He marched towards the door, and when he opened it, the cold air of the North crep into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fucking cold&rdquo; Tyrion muttered as he left.</p><p>Finally, Varys was left alone. Alone with his thoughts, and other people&rsquo;s truths and secrets. <i>But it&rsquo;s not enough</i>, he reminded himself. &nbsp;He dwelled on these thoughts while eating his broth, until a hard knock echoed in the whole room.</p><p>He opened the door and was surprised to see one of the Unsullied. &ldquo;Queen Daenerys requires your presence&rdquo; the warrior announced, his back straightened and his eyes looking at some fixed point behind Varys.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well&rdquo; he said to the young Unsullied.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>He found the young Targaryen queen looking at the snowy fields of the North through a window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, the North&rdquo; she said with some melancholy in her voice, still looking through the window. </p><p>&ldquo;It is, Your Grace. Though it&rsquo;s far too cold for my liking&rdquo; he offered, politely.</p><p>&ldquo;As it is for me&rdquo; she replied, looking at him over her shoulder. &ldquo;Please, sit&rdquo; she gestured with her hand at the chairs that were by the hearth. Then she gave a single nod to the Unsullied. Now, they were alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I wasn&rsquo;t summoned to talk about the chilly winds of the North&rdquo; he said as he sat down. The firewood from the hearth were cackling, making little noises, yet as he seated close to it to fight the cold, he couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder&hellip;<i> How can something be there to protect you from something but also be a threat itself?</i></p><p>&ldquo;No, you were not&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I summoned you because I want to talk about the North&rdquo; she said as she seated across him by the hearth.</p><p>The conversation he had with Tyrion earlier came back to his mind.</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;With all of them&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><p>&ldquo;I know they don&rsquo;t want me&rdquo; Daenerys said, with a mix of sadness, dissapointment and anger tinting her voice.</p><p>Varys only sighed. He knew she was far from over, that she needed to vent, so he let her. </p><p>&ldquo;Not the North, not the lords and ladies, not Lady Sansa and her family\" she remarked, anger starting to show in her voice and features. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to save them, can&rsquo;t they see?&rdquo; She then looked at him with her beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with doubts. Eyes trying to mask a thunderstorm. </p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace, the northmen are known for being proud. They just need a little more time. To get to know you&rdquo; he offered her. At his words, Daenerys seemed to relaxed a little, fixing her eyes in the fire. He took it as a sign to continue. &ldquo;You have to remember that the last memory they have of Targaryens are those of your father and eldest brother. They are not remembered fondly here&rdquo;.</p><p>The mention of her father and brother made her snapped her eyes back at him. &ldquo;And pray tell, Lord Varys, what do I have to do for the people of Westeros to realize I&rsquo;m not father nor my brother?&rdquo; she fumed.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect them to forget the last two decades, my Queen. But you can show them that there is more to the Targaryen name than your father and brother&rdquo; he insisted. </p><p>She returned her gaze to the flames. The way she seemed to be so enthralled by its dance reminded him of the red priestesses of R'hollor. Although the hearth gave the room some warmth, he still got chills.</p><p>&ldquo;I will show them there is more to the Targaryen name&rdquo; she echoed, still looking at the flames. But a thought seemed to snap her out of its spell. &ldquo;What about the Starks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon has been avoiding me since we arrived. Lady Sansa is courteous, yet I can see the ice in her eyes&rdquo;. she said in an exasperated tone. &ldquo;How do you suggest I win over the Lady of Winterfell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are both women of power, maybe you can try by starting there. Maybe you can open up to her about your experiences in Essos, let her get to know you&rdquo; he proposed.</p><p>She looked at him, with narrowed eyes, analyzing what he just said. Then, she turned her eyes to the flames again. &ldquo;What about Jon?&rdquo; she sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Tyrion wasn&rsquo;t able to reach him this morning. Winterfell&rsquo;s maester said he was busy discussing some strategies on how to defeat the Night King with his brother and the Tarly boy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he was discussing strategies, weren&rsquo;t we suppossed to be ther-&rdquo; she complained, but stopped herself when realization dawned in her eyes. &ldquo;Did you say Tarly boy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Samwell Tarly, Your Grace. Randyll Tarly&rsquo;s eldest son. He&rsquo;s a sworn brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. They tell me he&rsquo;s close friends with Jon Snow&rdquo; he explained. </p><p>The implications of what he just told her didn&rsquo;t escape her. Her queenly mask was slowly coming off. Varys could only look at her. Enthralled by the flames, she just stood still. The flames made her eyes shine in a beautiful and disturbing way.</p><p>&ldquo;That will be all, Lord Varys&rdquo; she said, never taking her eyes from the fire. &ldquo;Thank you for your counsel&rdquo;.</p><p>He respectfully bowed and walked out of her chambers as fast as propriety allowed. <i>She shouldn&rsquo;t be alone right now</i>, he thought. When he arrived to the entrance of the Guest Keep, he told one of the Dothraki posted there &ldquo;Go find Missandei of Naath. Tell her her Queen needs to speak to her&rdquo;.</p><p>He hoped Missandei&rsquo;s friendship and presence would act like a balm to the Dragon Queen&rsquo;s strong passions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>He was in the Kitchens, eating some hot broth, when a young maid came to him. He had asked his little birds to fly around the Wolves&rsquo; castle, looking for anything that might be useful. Most of them came empty-handed. But this young maid, Darla, she was one of the good ones.</p><p>&ldquo;M'lord, this is all I could find&rdquo; she said as she handed &nbsp;him a piece of paper. &ldquo;I tried to write as fast as I could&rdquo; she explained.</p><p>Varys opened the piece of paper and read it, but he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. He reread what Darla had written. &ldquo;Where did you find this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The chambers of that man from the Night&rsquo;s Watch. It was in an old book&rdquo; the young maid looked at him with impatient eyes. &ldquo;So, is it any good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea, young girl&rdquo; he told her as he gave her five gold dragons. At this, the young woman nodded and mouthed a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and left as fast as she could.</p><p>Now, the conversation between Bran Stark and Jon Snow made more sense. <i>This changes everything</i>, he thought. And his mind filled with those familiar doubts, but now they found a new partner in some treasonous thoughts. </p><p><br /></p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\n<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Varys liked the view from the battlements. The view of the vast snowy fields surrounding Winterfell could be an image that brought him peace and comfort; but given the threat of eternal winter, the view made him as if were staring at the flames, like he did all those years ago. He let out a heavy sigh, the cold air making it visible.<i> If only I could see things like I see this</i>, he reflected,<i> then maybe I could make my move</i>.</p><p>He remembered Littlefinger, then. Always eager to make his move, one that drive him forward, closer to his goal. <i>And because he&rsquo;s always so eager he leaves chaos in his wake. Chaos that loves to prey on others</i>, he thought. He remembered what Lady Sansa has said about him during the welcoming feast. &ldquo;<i>He went to the Vale, to oversee some things regarding the food</i>&rdquo; Ned Stark&rsquo;s daughter has said. But he knew Petyr Baelish, he knew him very well, and it was not like him to miss such an opportunity like this. <i>He&rsquo;s the master of chaos, and a Targaryen in Winterfell would be just the kind of situation he would like to exploit</i>. Maybe Lady Sansa was telling the truth. <i>But if it is the turth she was saying, that means she has power over him. And to have power over someone like Littlefinger&hellip;</i></p><p>His thoughts were interrumpted by the sound of someone approaching him. He turned around to find Ser Davos Seaworth. The man was a loyal and trusted advisor of Jon Snow. <i>Maybe he can give me some insight of what&rsquo;s Winterfell like under the rule of Eddard Stark&rsquo;s children</i>, he thought.</p><p>\"Ser Davos&rdquo; he greeted him with a light bow.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Varys&rdquo; he said, with some surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I didn&rsquo;t expect you to find out here. It&rsquo;s freezing cold&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just admiring what the North has to offer, ser&rdquo; he replied, returning his eyes to vast fields covered in snow.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a lot to admire, I&rsquo;d say. But we don&rsquo;t get to see this much snow on the South, so I think there is some beauty in it&rdquo; he commented.</p><p>&ldquo;What brings you here? Like you said, it&rsquo;s freezing cold&rdquo; he asked</p><p>&ldquo;War council. We&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to make best use of the battlements and the high grounds. We must use any advantage we have&rdquo; he answered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a military man, I do not understand the art of war&rdquo; he admitted &ldquo;but if there&rsquo;s a war council being held soon, let me know so I can inform our Queen&rdquo;</p><p>Davos Seaworth turned his head to him when he said our Queen. He was one of the very few that knew that Jon Snow was no longer King in the North. <i>Hopefully, it stays like that until the North warms up to Daenerys</i>, he thought.</p><p>Just as he turned his head to him, he turned it back to the fields. But they didn&rsquo;t capture his attention, since he turned his head back at him again, his eyes narrowed. &ldquo;May I ask you a question, Lord Varys?&rdquo; He nodded in response. &ldquo;Why do you serve Daenerys Targaryen?&rdquo;</p><p>Varys smiled at the bold man. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not like any other ruler the Seven Kingdoms have seen&rdquo; he offered. A nice, short and safe answer.</p><p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;She has dragons, but I guess that makes her like her ancestors&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried she might be like some of them? Like the worst of them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Consider me a subject interested in his new Queen. You see, Lord Varys, while Jon and I were in Dragonstone, we didn&rsquo;t get the chance to know much about her&rdquo; he replied</p><p>&ldquo;A wasted opportunity, I know. I advised her to let her people know her. I believe that will bring peace of mind to many&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. But northerners are tough, they&rsquo;re loyal to their own&rdquo; he argued. A small laugh left his lips after he said this, it was as if he was remembering something. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t earn their trust easily. It took me a long time and a bloody battle for me to earn the trust of many around here&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;She will make a good Queen, ser Davos. You have my word&rdquo;</p><p>Ser Davos chuckled at his answer. &ldquo;Can I be honest with you, Lord Varys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always&rdquo; he said, with a little bow</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your word they need. Like you said, they don&rsquo;t know her, and for them to accept her would take time&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;But time is something we don&rsquo;t have. I hope Queen Daenerys earns the North&rsquo;s trust. I really do&rdquo; he sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best for the realm, dear ser&rdquo; he assured him.</p><p>&ldquo;And what if she doesn&rsquo;t? What happens then?&rdquo; He had his narrowed eyes fixed on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope she does earn their trust, ser Davos&rdquo; he replied, the answer he really wanted to give him hidden in the words he said.</p><p>Davos Seaworth&rsquo;s narrowed eyes now widened. He seemed to understand what he meant to say. He took a deep breath while staring at the white snowed fields surrounding the castle, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope she does&rdquo; he echoed. After a few moments of silent meditation, ser Davos turned to him once more. &ldquo;Lord Varys&rdquo; he said as a goodbye.</p><p>He just nodded. The words of the onion knight echoed in his mind. Whether someone sent him or not, one thing was clear. Daenerys wasn&rsquo;t wanted here. Not as Queen, anyways. The North seemed very content with Sansa Stark as Lady of Winterfell and Jon Snow as their King. <i>A great pair</i>, he thought, <i>a most capable politician and a renowned warrior</i>. He let out a long sigh. He knew what this meant. <i>The Queen doesn&rsquo;t handle rejection very well, what happened at the Reach is testament of that</i>, he reflected. He decided he had enough of the winter winds for one day and headed to the Great Keep, looking for the only person able to appease the people.</p><p>He walked across the courtyard, where many men, women and children old enough to fight were training. Some with sword, others with bow and arrow. There were even some with spears, being trained by Greyworm. As he walked, he wondered how many people would die fighting for the living. <i>Let&rsquo;s just hope we win, otherwise it would&rsquo;ve been all for nothing</i>. </p><p>When he arrived at his destination, he took a deep breath to give himself some courage. <i>Give some in order to get some</i>, he reminded himself. <i>That&rsquo;s what this is about. Information</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you, m'lord?&rdquo; a northern man, no more than three-and-twenty, asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;d like to talk to Lady Stark&rdquo; he replied. He could see the anxiety in the young man&rsquo;s eyes. <i>Sansa Stark is not one to inspire fear. Something must&rsquo;ve happened.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait here, m'lord&rdquo;. After that, the young northman entered Lady Sansa&rsquo;s solar. A few minutes passed until the guard came out. &ldquo;Lady Sansa is waiting for you inside, m'lord&rdquo; the young man said with a light bow of his head.</p><p>As soon as the heavy wooden doors closed, Sansa Stark stood up. &ldquo;Lord Varys, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to see you so soon&rdquo; she said, not as the little lady he remembered from King&rsquo;s Landing, but as Lady of a great castle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid, my Lady, we weren&rsquo;t able to finish our conversation&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we did&rdquo; she said as she approached him. &ldquo;You were very clear on your stance, Lord Varys, and I like to believe I was very clear on mine&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s nothing left to discuss&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Lady Sansa&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not our last conversation that brought me here today&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Then what is it that brought you here today, Lord Varys?&rdquo; she asked, her face relaxed, but with ice in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Your family. And the future of Westeros&rdquo; he stated.</p><p>And at that, Sansa Stark gave him her full attention.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><i>A/N: you can also read <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15959798/chapters/44484595#workskin\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></i></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The winds were as harsh during the day as they were during nighttime. But Winterfell was a big castle, full of thick and warm walls that could shield you from the winter. There was a hidden little spot, just between the Library Tower and the Kitchens, perfect for a shadow to blend in with the great grey walls. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Why did you bend the knee?</i>&rdquo; he heard the Stark boy ask the newly appointed Warden of the North.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>To protect the North</i>&rdquo; Jon Snow replied, quickly and firmly. </p>\n<p>One of his fears was now confirmed. <i>Winterfell&rsquo;s Bastard is playing the game. A dangerous game,</i>&nbsp;he thought with surprise in his mind and fear in his heart. <i>Nothing good can come out of a fight between the Dragon and the pack of Wolves</i>. His thoughts were turning somber at great speed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>And why do you feel like you have to protect it?</i>&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Because it&rsquo;s my duty, It&rsquo;s always been. Ever since I swore an oath</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;he heard Jon Snow say. <i>His duty lies with his family and with his people. Like everyone in this realm&hellip; but he mentioned his oath</i>, he reflected.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>And that duty, that desire to protect the North, where does it come from?</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>I protect it because it&rsquo;s my home, a part of me</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Your home, and you love it. Sometimes, duty and love go hand in hand, but sometimes, we must choose between one and the other. Father chose both, his love was with your mother, as same as his duty. Robb chose love, forsaking his duty. Jon, you&rsquo;ve chosen duty over love so many times. You have the chance to choose love, now</i>&rdquo;. What the youngest son of Ned Stark said left him wondering. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;His love was with your mother&hellip;&rdquo; he repeated that over and over in his head. Lord Eddard Stark never said the name of his bastard&rsquo;s mother. Some said it was a lowborn woman, others said it was Ashara Dayne, but no one had a definitive answer. Why would Eddard Stark&rsquo;s love and duty lie with a mysterious woman, when he was a devoted husband to Catelyn Tully, when it was known that there was love in their marriage? He had heard of the time when Lady Stark had visited the capital, a lifetime ago&hellip; He felt as if he was looking at some forbidden image, without being able to decipher its meaning.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>But what about my duty? What about Daenerys?</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Everthing will work out the way it&rsquo;s supposed to</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The sound of the dragons flying over the castle broke him from his thoughts. He took it as a sign that it was time for him to leave.</p>\n<p>He headed towards the Kitchens, trying to look incospicous. He asked one of the maids to bring him some warmed dornish red, along with some broth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, m'lord. It&rsquo;ll be in your room in a moment&rdquo; said the young maid. </p>\n<p>He just bowed his head as a wordless &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>He took his time getting out of the Kitchens. He could see that Lord Eddard&rsquo;s daughter had managed to bring all the grains and resources she could. He heard whispers of the Lady of Winterfell, how she took care of her people. The movements in the Kitchens and in the Armory were a testament of that. <i>Who knew that little girl that once was Joffrey&rsquo;s plaything could become such a competent ruler</i>, he reflected. <i>It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, though. She learned how not to do things from the most incompetent monarchs in recent history&hellip; And Littlefinger</i>, he remembered. He heard whispers of him teaching her all he knows. <i>If it&rsquo;s true, that wouldn&rsquo;t only make her a competent ruler but also a skilled politician</i>. He dwelled on that thought for a while.</p>\n<p>He wandered a bit in the courtyard, watching the men and women train for the umpending battle against the dead. He saw Brienne of Tarth, commanding a small garrison of soldiers, teaching them all she could, given the little time they had. But the training of soldiers didn&rsquo;t capture his attention, the little She-Wolf did. He saw Lady Arya practice her shooting. All of the arrows she had fired had hit the bullseye. Just as he was turning his eyes to her again, he found her staring at him. She still had the bow tensed, the arrow ready to be fired. They locked eyes for mere seconds, but in those mere seconds she hit the bullseye yet again, all while glaring at him. Then, just as she arched an eyebrown, a small smug smile forming on her lips. He felt as if he had given her something. Unsettled, he bowed his head to her and left. He felt an incredibly strong need to be alone. <i>Things are not going as planned. The pups are wild beasts now. And we must act accordingly</i>, he thought.</p>\n<p>While making his way towards the Guest Keep, he saw Jon Snow all but run towards the Great Keep, with Winterfell&rsquo;s maester trying to keep up with him. He looked like a soldier, marching towards the battlefield. <i>A man with purpose</i>, he told himself. And again, the conversation he had with his brother came back to him. With all of this in mind, he headed towards his chambers.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;My dear friend&rdquo; Tyrion greeted him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was under the impression you wanted to have a few words with Jon Snow&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Tyrion grabbed a cup and started pouring some of the warmed Dornish red he had asked for, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a busy man&rdquo; he said before taking a long sip. &ldquo;But what about you? I came here to talk about our Queen, only to find an empty room&rdquo; he told him with fake dissapointment. &ldquo;Are you already weaving your little webs, Lord Varys?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You must have information, valuable information, in order to weave anything. And I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me, my friend, when I say that northmen aren&rsquo;t the sharing type&rdquo; pointed out the Spider. After this, silence surrounded them. He did the same as Tyrion; grabbed a cup and poured some Dornish red. The warmth of the drink relaxed him a bit; if he closed his eyes, he could almost pretend they were south of the Neck. Almost.</p>\n<p>They both had their missions. He had to find out any valuable information that would be useful, and Tyrion had to make the Starks understand the situation they were all dealing with, without offending anyone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Have you found anything?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing good. Turns out Jon Snow isn&rsquo;t as much of a fool as we all thought. His loyalties lie with the North and the Starks&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But then why is he-&rdquo; Tyrion stopped on his tracks as realization dawned on his face. &ldquo;He managed to bring her all this way North to fight alongside him&rdquo; he said while rubbing his neck. He opened his mouth to say something, but inmediately closed it. He jumped out of his chair and started pacing around the room. &ldquo;Do you realize what this means? One wrong look, one wrong word, and we&rsquo;re fucked&rdquo; he claimed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We can still salvage this alliance. She still believes him to be loyal to her&rdquo; Varys tried to appease his friend.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She believes him to be in love with her&rdquo; he claimed, while coming to a halt. He looked at Varys with pleading eyes, reminding him of something only the two of them knew. &ldquo;Did you found anything else?&rdquo; he sighed.</p>\n<p>Varys had his doubts about telling him about the rest of the conversation he overheard &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bring up an assumption and speak of it as if it were the truth&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must keep digging&rdquo;. He took a long sip of his cup. &ldquo;No. Not yet, at least&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Tyrion let out a long, heavy sigh. &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo; he said as he put his cup on the table and made his way to the door. &ldquo;Since the Warden of the North is busy, it seems I must talk to my Lady wife&rdquo; he jested.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the same girl we&rsquo;ve both seen at the Capital&rdquo; he reminded him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know&rdquo; he replied, all humor gone from his voice, &ldquo;she made that perfectly clear the same day we arrived&rdquo; he declared, with a sour tone. He stood still, facing the door, but Varys knew Tyrion. He had more to say. He was right; Tyrion pivoted and took long steps towards him, as long as his legs would allow him. &ldquo;I think she knows about the Reach&rdquo; he confessed.</p>\n<p>This surprised Varys. &ldquo;You think she knows about what exactly?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;About the Tarlys?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tyrion just shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, all of it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How could she possibly know all of it?&rdquo; he wondered, &ldquo;news don&rsquo;t travel as fast during winter&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, somehow the Lady of Winterfell knows about what our Queen did&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is not good&rdquo; Varys pointed out. &ldquo;These Stark children are definetely not like their parents. More difficult to read, and even more difficul to handle&rdquo; he thought. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fucked, Varys. Sansa can say all those very convincing words, and Daenerys can choose to believe all of it&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that none of us are welcomed here. Not you, not me, and definetely not our Queen&rdquo; he went back to table and poured the rest of the Dornish red in his cup. After taking a very long sip, he continued &ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With whom?</p>\n<p>Tyrion sighed yet again. \"With all of them&rdquo; he said after putting down his cup. He marched towards the door, and when he opened it, the cold air of the North crep into the room.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fucking cold&rdquo; Tyrion muttered as he left.</p>\n<p>Finally, Varys was left alone. Alone with his thoughts, and other people&rsquo;s truths and secrets. <i>But it&rsquo;s not enough</i>, he reminded himself. &nbsp;He dwelled on these thoughts while eating his broth, until a hard knock echoed in the whole room.</p>\n<p>He opened the door and was surprised to see one of the Unsullied. &ldquo;Queen Daenerys requires your presence&rdquo; the warrior announced, his back straightened and his eyes looking at some fixed point behind Varys.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Very well&rdquo; he said to the young Unsullied.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n<br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>He found the young Targaryen queen looking at the snowy fields of the North through a window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, the North&rdquo; she said with some melancholy in her voice, still looking through the window. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is, Your Grace. Though it&rsquo;s far too cold for my liking&rdquo; he offered, politely.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As it is for me&rdquo; she replied, looking at him over her shoulder. &ldquo;Please, sit&rdquo; she gestured with her hand at the chairs that were by the hearth. Then she gave a single nod to the Unsullied. Now, they were alone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I guess I wasn&rsquo;t summoned to talk about the chilly winds of the North&rdquo; he said as he sat down. The firewood from the hearth were cackling, making little noises, yet as he seated close to it to fight the cold, he couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder&hellip;<i> How can something be there to protect you from something but also be a threat itself?</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, you were not&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I summoned you because I want to talk about the North&rdquo; she said as she seated across him by the hearth.</p>\n<p>The conversation he had with Tyrion earlier came back to his mind.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><i><b>&ldquo;We have to be careful&rdquo;</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>&ldquo;With all of them&rdquo;</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b><br /></b></i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know they don&rsquo;t want me&rdquo; Daenerys said, with a mix of sadness, dissapointment and anger tinting her voice.</p>\n<p>Varys only sighed. He knew she was far from over, that she needed to vent, so he let her. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not the North, not the lords and ladies, not Lady Sansa and her family\" she remarked, anger starting to show in her voice and features. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to save them, can&rsquo;t they see?&rdquo; She then looked at him with her beautiful eyes. Eyes filled with doubts. Eyes trying to mask a thunderstorm. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your Grace, the northmen are known for being proud. They just need a little more time. To get to know you&rdquo; he offered her. At his words, Daenerys seemed to relaxed a little, fixing her eyes in the fire. He took it as a sign to continue. &ldquo;You have to remember that the last memory they have of Targaryens are those of your father and eldest brother. They are not remembered fondly here&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The mention of her father and brother made her snapped her eyes back at him. &ldquo;And pray tell, Lord Varys, what do I have to do for the people of Westeros to realize I&rsquo;m not father nor my brother?&rdquo; she fumed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect them to forget the last two decades, my Queen. But you can show them that there is more to the Targaryen name than your father and brother&rdquo; he insisted. </p>\n<p>She returned her gaze to the flames. The way she seemed to be so enthralled by its dance reminded him of the red priestesses of R'hollor. Although the hearth gave the room some warmth, he still got chills.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will show them there is more to the Targaryen name&rdquo; she echoed, still looking at the flames. But a thought seemed to snap her out of its spell. &ldquo;What about the Starks?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jon has been avoiding me since we arrived. Lady Sansa is courteous, yet I can see the ice in her eyes&rdquo;. she said in an exasperated tone. &ldquo;How do you suggest I win over the Lady of Winterfell?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You are both women of power, maybe you can try by starting there. Maybe you can open up to her about your experiences in Essos, let her get to know you&rdquo; he proposed.</p>\n<p>She looked at him, with narrowed eyes, analyzing what he just said. Then, she turned her eyes to the flames again. &ldquo;What about Jon?&rdquo; she sighed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Lord Tyrion wasn&rsquo;t able to reach him this morning. Winterfell&rsquo;s maester said he was busy discussing some strategies on how to defeat the Night King with his brother and the Tarly boy&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If he was discussing strategies, weren&rsquo;t we suppossed to be ther-&rdquo; she complained, but stopped herself when realization dawned in her eyes. &ldquo;Did you say Tarly boy?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Samwell Tarly, Your Grace. Randyll Tarly&rsquo;s eldest son. He&rsquo;s a sworn brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. They tell me he&rsquo;s close friends with Jon Snow&rdquo; he explained. </p>\n<p>The implications of what he just told her didn&rsquo;t escape her. Her queenly mask was slowly coming off. Varys could only look at her. Enthralled by the flames, she just stood still. The flames made her eyes shine in a beautiful and disturbing way.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That will be all, Lord Varys&rdquo; she said, never taking her eyes from the fire. &ldquo;Thank you for your counsel&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>He respectfully bowed and walked out of her chambers as fast as propriety allowed. <i>She shouldn&rsquo;t be alone right now</i>, he thought. When he arrived to the entrance of the Guest Keep, he told one of the Dothraki posted there &ldquo;Go find Missandei of Naath. Tell her her Queen needs to speak to her&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>He hoped Missandei&rsquo;s friendship and presence would act like a balm to the Dragon Queen&rsquo;s strong passions.</p>\n</p>",

Not many people knew and those who did couldn\u2019t give you much of anything, seeing as everyone was settling into Dany being queen and coming down from the war. You were standing on the balcony outside your chambers, watching as the northsmen and Unsullied helped to train men and women who had been under Cersi\u2019s rule. You smiled fondly at the fact that everything had panned out so nicely. You, platonically, loved Dany and thought her to be a fit and kind ruler. You knew Jon would be of wise counciler while he served as both her lord and her lover. </p><!-- more --><p>You were quite thankful for the fact that Dany allowed you and Jon to be together. Although he first and foremost served her, he also loved you deeply. You had fought by his side and saved his life many times after meeting at The Wall. He cared for you more than any other man, but his heart was also occupied by a woman, his queen. You didn\u2019t mind sharing him, there was enough of him to go around after all, but it did mean you didn\u2019t get to have intimacy as often as you once did. You did attempt to share a bed with both of them, but seeing as you were gay and it was difficult for you to get things going around Dany, that experiment quickly fizzled. </p><p>You were broken from you thoughts by a small knock on your door. You didn\u2019t feel like coming inside quite yet so you simply asked whoever it was to come inside. You turned around to see Dany and Jon. \u201cMind if we join you out there?\u201d Dany asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, the weather\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d You commented as they approached you on the balcony.</p><p>You started to say a proper hello, but Jon cupped your cheek and pressed a kiss to your lips. You hummed softly, one hand landing on his shoulder. When you parted, you caught Dany\u2019s smile in the corner of your eye.</p><p>\u201cJon mentioned today was your birthday, so I thought of a gift for you.\u201d She said, running her hand along your arm in an affectionate and kind manner. </p><p>\u201cOh, what might that be?\u201d You retorted playfully, curious of what your queen could give you.</p><p>Jon kissed your jaw and then the shell of your ear before he spoke lowly. \u201cDany would like to give us some time alone.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as warm blush flooded your cheeks. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d You asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s the least I could offer.\u201d She pressed a small kiss to your cheek. \u201cHappy birthday, have fun.\u201d</p><p>Dany turned on her heel and left the door, making sure to shut the main door behind her. You turned to Jon, smiling widely. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He agreed with a small chuckle. \u201cAre you still alright with bottoming?\u201d He stroked his thumb over your cheek and then your lips.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d You grasped his tunic and pulled him towards your bed.</p><p>You fell back into the sheets, removing your shirt and tossing it to floor. You watched Jon do the same, still standing above you. You bit your lip but let out a squeak of a giggle when he absolutely tackled you, burying his face in your neck, leaving playful kisses everywhere he could. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed your touch, love.\u201d He admitted. \u201cI adore Dany, but you bring upon an entirely separate emotion than she does. My love for you and her is different, but equal. Do you get my meaning?\u201d He asked as he left affection down your chest. </p><p>\u201cI think I do, even if I cannot relate.\u201d You said, stroking his hair. </p><p>\u201cGood. But anyways, today is about you.\u201d He smiled, a rare occurrence. \u201cHow can I make you feel good?\u201d</p><p>You cupped his face in your hands. \u201cJust fuck me. You have no idea how much I\u2019ve missed it.\u201d</p><p>Jon was more than happy to meet your request. He took off his own trousers and then yours, prepping you for a long while before he finally pushed in. Every thrust was smooth and purposeful, almost each one hitting your prostate. You moaned and held onto your partner tightly, kissing his neck and shoulder as he pounded into you. You didn\u2019t last very long the first round, but after the second, your stamina was much better. Jon brought you to climax three times before he was too exhausted for any more, as were you at that point. He had come twice himself, leaving both of you quite satisfied.</p><p>He laid beside you, gently running his fingers through your hair and occasionally leaving sleepy kisses on your lips. You moved your own hand across his side, enjoying the feel of his muscles and smooth skin. You laid there for a while, enjoying his company and talking in quiet voices about everything that was happening around you. It was perfect, you\u2019d have to remember to thank Dany for such an excellent present.</p>",

You smiled fondly at the fact that everything had panned out so nicely. You, platonically, loved Dany and thought her to be a fit and kind ruler. You knew Jon would be of wise counciler while he served as both her lord and her lover. </p>[[MORE]]<p>You were quite thankful for the fact that Dany allowed you and Jon to be together. Although he first and foremost served her, he also loved you deeply. You had fought by his side and saved his life many times after meeting at The Wall. He cared for you more than any other man, but his heart was also occupied by a woman, his queen. You didn\u2019t mind sharing him, there was enough of him to go around after all, but it did mean you didn\u2019t get to have intimacy as often as you once did. You did attempt to share a bed with both of them, but seeing as you were gay and it was difficult for you to get things going around Dany, that experiment quickly fizzled. </p><p>You were broken from you thoughts by a small knock on your door. You didn\u2019t feel like coming inside quite yet so you simply asked whoever it was to come inside. You turned around to see Dany and Jon. \u201cMind if we join you out there?\u201d Dany asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, the weather\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d You commented as they approached you on the balcony.</p><p>You started to say a proper hello, but Jon cupped your cheek and pressed a kiss to your lips. You hummed softly, one hand landing on his shoulder. When you parted, you caught Dany\u2019s smile in the corner of your eye.</p><p>\u201cJon mentioned today was your birthday, so I thought of a gift for you.\u201d She said, running her hand along your arm in an affectionate and kind manner. </p><p>\u201cOh, what might that be?\u201d You retorted playfully, curious of what your queen could give you.</p><p>Jon kissed your jaw and then the shell of your ear before he spoke lowly. \u201cDany would like to give us some time alone.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as warm blush flooded your cheeks. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d You asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s the least I could offer.\u201d She pressed a small kiss to your cheek. \u201cHappy birthday, have fun.\u201d</p><p>Dany turned on her heel and left the door, making sure to shut the main door behind her. You turned to Jon, smiling widely. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He agreed with a small chuckle. \u201cAre you still alright with bottoming?\u201d He stroked his thumb over your cheek and then your lips.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d You grasped his tunic and pulled him towards your bed.</p><p>You fell back into the sheets, removing your shirt and tossing it to floor. You watched Jon do the same, still standing above you. You bit your lip but let out a squeak of a giggle when he absolutely tackled you, burying his face in your neck, leaving playful kisses everywhere he could. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed your touch, love.\u201d He admitted. \u201cI adore Dany, but you bring upon an entirely separate emotion than she does. My love for you and her is different, but equal. Do you get my meaning?\u201d He asked as he left affection down your chest. </p><p>\u201cI think I do, even if I cannot relate.\u201d You said, stroking his hair. </p><p>\u201cGood. But anyways, today is about you.\u201d He smiled, a rare occurrence. \u201cHow can I make you feel good?\u201d</p><p>You cupped his face in your hands. \u201cJust fuck me. You have no idea how much I\u2019ve missed it.\u201d</p><p>Jon was more than happy to meet your request. He took off his own trousers and then yours, prepping you for a long while before he finally pushed in. Every thrust was smooth and purposeful, almost each one hitting your prostate. You moaned and held onto your partner tightly, kissing his neck and shoulder as he pounded into you. You didn\u2019t last very long the first round, but after the second, your stamina was much better. Jon brought you to climax three times before he was too exhausted for any more, as were you at that point. He had come twice himself, leaving both of you quite satisfied.</p><p>He laid beside you, gently running his fingers through your hair and occasionally leaving sleepy kisses on your lips. You moved your own hand across his side, enjoying the feel of his muscles and smooth skin. You laid there for a while, enjoying his company and talking in quiet voices about everything that was happening around you. It was perfect, you\u2019d have to remember to thank Dany for such an excellent present.</p></p>",
