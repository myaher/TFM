She groaned and slowly sat up, pulling on her sweatpants and scratching at her stomach. He opened the door to her bedroom and leaned heavily against the doorframe just as there was another knock on the door. Jester\u2019s bedroom door opened a moment later and she stepped out looking immaculate in her short, lace nightgown with her hair pulled up in curlers despite it being the middle of the night.

Jester pulled a long robe over her nightgown and tied it off as she followed several feet behind her roommate. Beau opened up the door and leaned intimidatingly in the doorway, glaring at the scruffy faced, ginger man standing nervously on the other side. His shoulder length, curly red hair was pulled up in a ponytail high on his head and he was wearing a loose, stained gray shirt and a pair of red shorts. \u201cWhatdyawan?\u201d Beau mumbled, barely able to make words.</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry to wake you.

That\u2019s exactly what fucking time it is, jackass. What the fuck do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for bothering you so early in the morning,\u201d he said. As he spoke she realized that he had a thick Zemnian accent. \u201cMy cat jumped from my balcony to your balcony.\u201d</p><p>Beau gave him a dubious look and opened her mouth to speak but Jester called up from behind her. \u201cIs it a pervert?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The man blanched at the suggestion. \u201cAh, nein! Nein, I\u2019m not a pervert. I\u2019m here for my cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying it,\u201d Beau sneered. \u201cJes, can you peek out on the balcony real quick? Is there a cat?\u201d She heard Jester moving around behind her and crossed her arms to show off the lithe muscles of her arms. \u201cIf you\u2019re pulling something I\u2019m gonna kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d he huffed heavily through his nose. \u201cI just want my cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me for being careful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- Nein, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my Gods!\u201d Jester exclaimed, then she made a cooing noise and Beau heard her open the balcony door. \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a cute kitty! Hi there, pretty boy! Oh, you\u2019re so snuggly, Ilovehimsomuch!\u201d</p><p>Beau rolled her eyes and stepped out of the doorway. \u201cFine. Come in.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated just a moment before moving passed her into the apartment. The apartment was dirty, but not in a gross way, it was just a lot of stuff laying around. Clothes, bags, shoes, and whatnot spread around haphazardly. The tiefling started walking towards him and he realized that she had the cat in her arms like a baby.</p><p>\u201cAh, he doesn\u2019t like-\u201d He cut himself off when he realized that the cat was purring. \u201cNevermind..\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Beau asked, reaching out and gently scratching the cat\u2019s head with her nails. His back arched to press his head into her hand.</p><p>\u201cFrumpkin.\u201d</p><p>Jester giggled. \u201cHello Frumpkin! My name is Jester. You\u2019re so cute. Here, you can take him home.\u201d She held the cat out towards him and when he pulled Frumpkin to his chest the cat climbed up on his shoulders and curled around his neck, purring quietly.</p><p>\u201cThank you for letting me come get him. I am sorry to have woken you so early.\u201d</p><p>Beau shrugged. \u201cWell, we got to see a cat so it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like birds better, but yeah.

Jester\u2019s bedroom door opened a moment later and she stepped out looking immaculate in her short, lace nightgown with her hair pulled up in curlers despite it being the middle of the night.

Beau opened up the door and leaned intimidatingly in the doorway, glaring at the scruffy faced, ginger man standing nervously on the other side. His shoulder length, curly red hair was pulled up in a ponytail high on his head and he was wearing a loose, stained gray shirt and a pair of red shorts. \u201cWhatdyawan?\u201d Beau mumbled, barely able to make words.</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry to wake you.

The rumble of purring against the back of his neck is soothing, therapy for his frayed nerves and the lingering pain behind the linen. Things seem\u2026 better, like this.

Danke. <i>Danke</i>.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s easier to thank Fjord for that, than to thank him for staying. To thank <i>all</i> of them for staying, for not just cutting their losses and leaving as soon as they realised he was <i>useless</i>. Like this, though\u2026 like this, he can be useful. He can <i>still</i> be useful. He can make sure they keep him him around, and Nott too.</p><p>He tells himself he wants them to keep him around because they\u2019re useful. Because he still needs them, and she does too. That\u2019s why he wants them to stay.</p><p>Fjord shifts, awkwardly \u2013 and, as Caleb sinks inside Frumpkin\u2019s head for the first time in <i>weeks</i>, he can <i>see</i> it, not just hear it by the rustle of fabric and scrape of clothing against the floor and walls. The half-orc looks odd through a cat\u2019s eyes, faintly distorted and shades of yellow-brown more than green, but it is still <i>sight</i>, and it is nearly enough to start him sobbing again.</p><p>He resists the urge. Just.</p><p>\u201cWell, y\u2019know,\u201d says Fjord, clearly unsure how to deal with the Nein\u2019s resident bag-of-cats-crazy wizard and his reaction to his cat, his newly summoned eyes. Handling other people has never been his strong suit, other than when he\u2019s trying to charm his way through an interaction. \u201cIt\u2019s nothin\u2019, really, it\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what friends are for, ain\u2019t it? Happy to help.\u201d</p><p>Caleb <i>doesn\u2019t</i> know, has never had friends who would do anything of the sort for him \u2013 but he has no desire to argue, and no energy to, to boot. \u201cAh, well,\u201d he says, instead, scrubbing hands across his tearless, linen-covered eyes. \u201cThank you, still.\u201d </p><p>He slips hands under Frumpkin\u2019s stomach, and lifts the cat to settle around his neck, weathering the familiar swoop of giddiness as the world in front of his eyes moves whilst his body stays still. The rumble of purring against the back of his neck is soothing, therapy for his frayed nerves and the lingering pain behind the linen. Things seem\u2026 better, like this. He has his cat, and his sight, and it is- not perfect, but <i>easier</i>.</p><p>He will adapt. He will learn. He is a survivor, in the end, against his better instincts, broken glass and blackened soul and all. It will take more than being maimed to change that about him \u2013 he still has a mission to complete, after all.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he says, into the silence, getting to his feet confident and steady for the first time in a week with the help of his borrowed eyes, \u201cthat we should, ah\u2026 rejoin the others, perhaps, <i>ja</i>? Before Jester and Nott buy us pastries and bacon for dinner. I would like-\u201d <i>To see you again. Your faces. Memorise what they look like, through these eyes.</i> \u201c-something, something less\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely to be three-day-old pocket food?\u201d asks Fjord, grimacing \u2013 and Caleb can<i> see</i> him grimacing, <i>he can see it</i>, desaturated yellow-beige and blurry but still visible. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d He stands up, stretches, and is almost at the now-customary position at Caleb\u2019s elbow to guide him before catching himself. \u201cOh! Shit, yeah, right,\u201d he says, and grins, gesturing to the door. \u201cWell then. After you.\u201d</p><p>And Caleb, to his surprise, smiles back, the expression small and full of steel. When he opens the door and walks through it, his cat around his neck, and his head is held high.</p></p>",

Furred thumb-pads press against the sallow skin and fragile bone of Caleb&rsquo;s undereye. When he speaks, it&rsquo;s low enough that Caleb feels the rolling vibration of it in his chest. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some things even the gods can&rsquo;t fix,&rdquo; he says, calmly, as he pulls his hands away, leaving Caleb&rsquo;s face cold and the hollow knot of fear-resignation in his chest even colder. &ldquo;Or don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;m not sure. Either way&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s brief enough compared to his usual rambling that Caleb actually believes him. The gods not wanting to heal him, wanting him to <i>suffer</i>, seems about right. It&rsquo;s only fair.</p><p>Jester is a little more informative, though Caleb wishes she weren&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Oh, <i>Caleb</i>,&rdquo; she says, and though he can&rsquo;t see it, he can almost <i>feel</i> her lower lip trembling, the tears filling her eyes. She <i>is</i> the cleric, after all; this is personal. This is failure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m so sorry, it&rsquo;s just- there&rsquo;s, uhm, there&rsquo;s nothing- <i>left</i>. You need something to work with, if you&rsquo;re healing, like, skin, or muscle, or- <i>something</i>. But there&rsquo;s not- I mean, I can get rid of the hurt, I can heal it up, but not- regrow them. I can&rsquo;t do that, I don&rsquo;t think <i>anyone</i> can.&rdquo; He can hear the wobble in her voice, the tears glittering on her eyelashes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so, <i>so</i> sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; okay,&rdquo; he says to each of them, once they&rsquo;re done, though it&rsquo;s really not. His smile is forced, toothless. The stained linen over his eye sockets itches. &ldquo;Thank you, for trying.&rdquo;</p><p>He adapts; of course he does. Of all the things he is, Caleb is a survivor, through luck or through cowardice or through not knowing when to just fucking lay down and <i>die</i>. The rest of the Nein treat him like so much broken glass, but the joke&rsquo;s on them &ndash; that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s always been. So he keeps going, learns to dress himself and eat and drink, reassures Nott far more than she does him, and fights the urge every morning to just <i>let go</i> the way he had after his parents had burned.</p><p>It takes three weeks before he has the strength and components to re-summon Frumpkin. It&rsquo;s hard without his sight &ndash; he has to ask Fjord for help with the symbols and the circles and the fine visual details of it, and pray the description is accurate enough that he really <i>will</i> summon his familiar, and not some demonic entity. It&rsquo;s <i>humiliating</i>, having to rely on another to perform basic magic, a spell that should come to him as easy as breathing &ndash; but Fjord is patient, and doesn&rsquo;t patronise, and it is&hellip; bearable. Though in fairness, most things would be bearable in the service of getting his cat back.</p><p>When the spell ends, and Frumpkin is sitting there, <i>his cat</i> is sitting there- </p><p>He breaks. Hunches over the fey scrap of fur and purring in his lap, and cries, and <i>cries</i>, sobbing and heaving without tears &ndash; because they took that from him, too, his tears. Instead, he buries his face into Frumpkin&rsquo;s soft back, and lets his shoulders shake and his lungs stutter until the twisted knot of misery in his chest loosens enough for him to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Thank you,&rdquo; he says, finally, without unburying his face from his cat.
