It had been a long day at work, a double shift. Spending 24 hours in the trauma casualty department was not for everyone but I loved it. The emergencies being rushed through the doors and into the resuscitation bay always gave me a rush of adrenalin, what felt like minutes took hours but the best part of my job was saving lives. Some deaths are inevitable, its the first thing they teach you in med school.\u00a0</p><p>But today was different&hellip;</p><p>The breaks had failed on a double-decker bus, it went hurdling into the middle of a cycling race, passengers, cyclists and bystanders were brought into Trauma. Out of the one hundred and sixty-four patients that had been brought in, only seventy survived.\u00a0</p><p>I kicked off my shoes and took off my jacket and left them neatly by the door, my feet ached. A long sigh left my lips as a put my bag down and finally relaxed. I was starving, all I had eaten were energy bars. I needed to decompress, the day was still heavy on my shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>I flicked on the light in the living room to see Dan sleeping on the couch. A small blanket hung off his legs, he must have waited for me. Not forgetting about my disgusting body-fluid stained scrubs I quickly washed up, a hot shower was exactly what I needed right now.</p><p>\u201cHey darling\u201d Dan stood outside the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHun\u201d I wrapped my arms around his neck, letting my body fall against his. We stood like that for a few minutes, just holding each other. Dan\u2019s arms loosened from my waist and his hands took their place on my hips. \u201clong day\u201d His eyes softened, \u201cI heard the news\u201d.

On the inside, you were screaming. You didn&rsquo;t know how to feel. You were going to meet Daniel James Howell, the person you had had a crush on for at least nine years. Sure, it was just an internet crush, but now you lived in the same country. Hell, your brother was his best friend. This measly internet crush was growing into so much more.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you say you needed again?&rdquo; Phil asked. You swallowed before clearing your throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Flour, salt, eggs, water, ground beef, ground veal, butter, a clove of garlic, spinach, parsley, Romano cheese, and nutmeg.&rdquo; You replied. Phil nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;When do you plan on going to the bank?&rdquo; He asked before sending the text and slipping his phone into his pocket. You thought for a second before shrugging.</p><p>&ldquo;Either tonight or early tomorrow morning.&rdquo; You replied. He nodded.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m ready to leave whenever you are,&rdquo; Phil said. You lifted your wrist and looked at your watch. <i>6:42</i>. You chewed on your lip in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me like 20 minutes so I can take a shower. Wash all the airplane ick off.&rdquo; You replied. Phil nodded. You walked around your living room, peering at all the boxes and looking for the one marked clothes. After about a minute of searching, you finally found it. You pulled out the first shirt, pair of pants, and undergarments you could find. A (f/b) t-shirt and a pair of jeans. It would do.</p><p>You grabbed your travel bag and headed the bathroom. You sighed heavily as you stared at the shower. There&rsquo;s no fucking curtain, you thought as you rubbed your forehead. You sighed and shook your head. Bathing it is. You set your bag and clothes down before turning on the hot water faucet and turning the cold one so the temperature was just right. You placed the bath stopper in the drain and waited for the tub to fill up and once it was about 75% full you switched off the faucets.</p><p>You quickly stripped yourself of your clothes before sinking into the warm water. You sighed as it encased you. It was incredibly relaxing and you wished you could stay submerged in the rejuvenating element forever but you knew you had to hurry. You leaned your head back and made sure your hair was soaked before you reached over the sill and grabbed your travel sized bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.</p><p>You lathered your hair until you were satisfied with the suds and dunked your head, washing out the remnant soap. You repeated that with the conditioner and then quickly washed your body. You carefully stood and grabbed your towel from your bag. After drying quickly you dressed at the same speed. You grabbed your brush and raked through the strands before putting on deodorant. You looked in the mirror and sighed. <i>Not exactly what I would&rsquo;ve liked to meet him in, but what can I do?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m ready. Just need to put my shoes on.&rdquo; You said as you opened the door. Phil glanced over his shoulder and nodded. You skipped on a pair of socks and the shoes you had worn on your flight, not feeling like fishing out another pair. You stood up and glanced at Phil as he patted his pockets to make sure he had everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, do you mind if (D/n) comes? She&rsquo;s been cooped up in that truck without me for like 11 hours, I&rsquo;d hate to leave her here for another two.&rdquo; You said. Phil laughed before nodding.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, of course. I don&rsquo;t mind and I highly doubt Dan will.&rdquo; Phil replied. You smiled and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on (D/n), let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; You said as you grabbed your phone, your charger, and your keys. You opened the door and waited as Phil walked out, (D/n) following. You closed the door and upon locking it, Phil began to signal for a Taxi. One stopped and Phil gave him the address as you opened the door for (D/n). You got in after her and Phil got in after you. You swallowed as a million things ran through your head. You were on your way to meet Daniel Howell and cook him dinner.<i> Life in London truly was turning out to be an adventure.</i></p>",

On the inside, you were screaming. You didn\u2019t know how to feel. You were going to meet Daniel James Howell, the person you had had a crush on for at least nine years. Sure, it was just an internet crush, but now you lived in the same country. Hell, your brother was his best friend. This measly internet crush was growing into so much more.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say you needed again?\u201d Phil asked. You swallowed before clearing your throat.</p><p>\u201cFlour, salt, eggs, water, ground beef, ground veal, butter, a clove of garlic, spinach, parsley, Romano cheese, and nutmeg.\u201d You replied. Phil nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan on going to the bank?\u201d He asked before sending the text and slipping his phone into his pocket. You thought for a second before shrugging.</p><p>\u201cEither tonight or early tomorrow morning.\u201d You replied. He nodded.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m ready to leave whenever you are,\u201d Phil said. You lifted your wrist and looked at your watch. <i>6:42</i>. You chewed on your lip in thought.</p><p>\u201cGive me like 20 minutes so I can take a shower. Wash all the airplane ick off.\u201d You replied. Phil nodded. You walked around your living room, peering at all the boxes and looking for the one marked clothes. After about a minute of searching, you finally found it. You pulled out the first shirt, pair of pants, and undergarments you could find. A (f/b) t-shirt and a pair of jeans. It would do.</p><p>You grabbed your travel bag and headed the bathroom. You sighed heavily as you stared at the shower. There\u2019s no fucking curtain, you thought as you rubbed your forehead. You sighed and shook your head. Bathing it is. You set your bag and clothes down before turning on the hot water faucet and turning the cold one so the temperature was just right. You placed the bath stopper in the drain and waited for the tub to fill up and once it was about 75% full you switched off the faucets.</p><p>You quickly stripped yourself of your clothes before sinking into the warm water. You sighed as it encased you. It was incredibly relaxing and you wished you could stay submerged in the rejuvenating element forever but you knew you had to hurry. You leaned your head back and made sure your hair was soaked before you reached over the sill and grabbed your travel sized bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.</p><p>You lathered your hair until you were satisfied with the suds and dunked your head, washing out the remnant soap. You repeated that with the conditioner and then quickly washed your body. You carefully stood and grabbed your towel from your bag. After drying quickly you dressed at the same speed. You grabbed your brush and raked through the strands before putting on deodorant. You looked in the mirror and sighed. <i>Not exactly what I would\u2019ve liked to meet him in, but what can I do?</i></p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m ready. Just need to put my shoes on.\u201d You said as you opened the door. Phil glanced over his shoulder and nodded. You skipped on a pair of socks and the shoes you had worn on your flight, not feeling like fishing out another pair. You stood up and glanced at Phil as he patted his pockets to make sure he had everything.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you mind if (D/n) comes? She\u2019s been cooped up in that truck without me for like 11 hours, I\u2019d hate to leave her here for another two.\u201d You said. Phil laughed before nodding.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, of course. I don\u2019t mind and I highly doubt Dan will.\u201d Phil replied. You smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cCome on (D/n), let\u2019s go.\u201d You said as you grabbed your phone, your charger, and your keys. You opened the door and waited as Phil walked out, (D/n) following. You closed the door and upon locking it, Phil began to signal for a Taxi. One stopped and Phil gave him the address as you opened the door for (D/n). You got in after her and Phil got in after you. You swallowed as a million things ran through your head. You were on your way to meet Daniel Howell and cook him dinner.<i> Life in London truly was turning out to be an adventure.</i></p></p>",
