The beverage burned your tongue but you welcomed the distraction without a wince. You put the cup down on the kitchen counter with a soft thud. The only sound that filled the room was the incessant ticking noise of the clock on the wall. You picked up your phone and flipped it open. Steve had called you earlier but you had ignored it, not in the mood to talk about anything. You pressed a button to hear the voicemail and soon, his soothing voice echoed in the empty room.  &ldquo;Hey Y/N&hellip; I just wanted to see how you were holding up, just checking in&hellip;&rdquo;  He paused and you heard only silence for a few seconds. You first thought that it was it but then, he added :  &ldquo;Also&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry.

But that was before she went to Lagos for her paper&hellip;  You heard a soft knock on the door, interrupting your thoughts. You didn&rsquo;t bulge, hoping that they would simply go away. It was most probably one of your neighbours wanting some milk. But you didn&rsquo;t want to cross your small apartment for that. But when a second knock echoed, you sighed before getting up tiredly and going to the door. You checked through the peephole and recoiled immediately as you recognised who was on the landing. You considered the idea of pretending you weren&rsquo;t home but it was useless.  </p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re in there&hellip;&rdquo; she said, her sokovian accent making its way to your ears.  You pressed your lips in a tight line, breathing carefully through your nose. Slowly, you grabbed the door handle and pulled on it, your breath catching in your throat as you met Wanda&rsquo;s gaze. She looked miserable, her eyes glistening with unshed tears, her long brown hair in a mess. But judging by how her face fell when she laid eyes on you, you knew you probably looked worse.  </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here ?&rdquo; you managed to ask, your voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>She stared at you in silence before saying lightly :  &ldquo;I wanted to see you&hellip;&rdquo;  </p><p>You nodded blankly, hoping she would just go away. She was only making this more difficult, more painful.  &ldquo;Well, you just did, so&hellip;&rdquo;  You began to close the door but she raised her hand in a defensive manner, stopping you.  &ldquo;Wait !&rdquo;  You stopped mid-movement, repressing a sigh. She was now fumbling with her hands, her big eyes searching your face for something she would most probably not find. You wondered what they were all up to now at S.H.I.E.L.D&rsquo;S headquarters. Surely the explosion caused by Wanda in Nigeria had brought a whole lot of problems on them. But you personally had other things on your mind. Like going to your friend&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house to tell her that her child wouldn&rsquo;t make it home this time. And then you had gotten back to your own place to try and wrap your mind around the fact that you would never see your best friend again. All because of a stupid mistake&hellip;  </p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she blurted out, her voice shaking slightly.  </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t say anything, you just kept looking at her small frame in the entrance of your flat. She recoiled slightly, noticing your uneasy silence. She continued though, her voice cracking from the emotion. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean for any of this to happen, I&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think you should go.&rdquo; you said flatly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, please !&rdquo; she exclaimed as you were closing the door again. She took a small step inside, causing you to back away just a bit to keep some distance between the two of you. &ldquo;Tell me what I can do to fix this !&rdquo; </p><p>You flinched at her words and you replied with more strength than before :  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t <i>fix</i> it ! They&rsquo;re dead, she is dead ! There&rsquo;s nothing left to fix !&rdquo;  </p><p>Her chin trembled and her gaze went to the floor. Somehow, this still broke your heart, despite everything. You felt your chest tighten, making you almost suffocate. A few tears ran down your cheeks, your eyes burning from trying to repress them. You angrily wiped your face with the sleeve of your old sweater.  </p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to say ?&rdquo; you asked bitterly. &ldquo;That it&rsquo;s all gonna be okay ? That I forgive you ?&rdquo;  Your voice wobbled on the last words, making it difficult for you to get them out. Wanda shook her head silently, her watery eyes blinking furiously in an attempt to keep the tears from falling.</p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not why I came&hellip;&rdquo; she uttered.  You looked at her questioningly, waiting for an answer.  &ldquo;I came to say goodbye&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You froze into place, suddenly struck by a feeling of dread. She probably noticed the sudden pallor of your face because she explained calmly :  &ldquo;They will come for me&hellip;&rdquo;  </p><p>You swallowed with difficulty as you heart sped up inexplicably. Of course they would. It shouldn&rsquo;t even shock you. They would probably lock her away too. And who knew what would happen to her after that.  &ldquo;When ?&rdquo; you murmured, your voice barely audible.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; she answered with her accent that had made you dizzy so many times before. &ldquo;Soon probably. I wanted to see you one last time before that.&rdquo;  </p><p>New tears came to your eyes, but for a whole other reason this time.  &ldquo;You could run&hellip;&rdquo; you suggested.  </p><p>A tiny smile stretched her lips but it didn&rsquo;t really last, nor did it reach her eyes. An indescribable sadness crossed her gaze as she said :  &ldquo;Running was always more my brother&rsquo;s style, no ?&rdquo;  </p><p>You simply nodded, not knowing what to say. She had lost someone too for the sake of the Avengers. But before you could think more about it, she took a step back, finding herself out of your flat once again.  </p><p>You could still see her, very clearly, like she was always meant to be in your sight, but somehow, it seemed like she had already left a long time ago. That&rsquo;s when you knew that she indeed hadn&rsquo;t come to beg for forgiveness. She had really come for a goodbye. At the very moment she had knocked on your door, she was actually already gone. And so you let her.  She looked at you one last time, her light green eyes brushing over every feature of yours, like she wanted to memorize your face perfectly. Like she would never see it again. In a certain way, you did just the same, wondering how things could have turned this way. You wanted to say something so badly, but nothing came out, and it was her who spoke.  &ldquo;Take care of yourself, Y/N.&rdquo; she murmured softly.  </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t reply. You didn&rsquo;t move. You just stood there as she went away, leaving you alone like you had told her to when she had first arrived.  Your first thought was that your flat had strangely got a lot colder. The second was that it wasn&rsquo;t something a hot drink would fix this time. And the last, that you should have said goodbye too.</p>",

You felt your chest tighten, making you almost suffocate. A few tears ran down your cheeks, your eyes burning from trying to repress them. You angrily wiped your face with the sleeve of your old sweater.  </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say ?\u201d you asked bitterly. \u201cThat it\u2019s all gonna be okay ? That I forgive you ?\u201d  Your voice wobbled on the last words, making it difficult for you to get them out. Wanda shook her head silently, her watery eyes blinking furiously in an attempt to keep the tears from falling.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not why I came\u2026\u201d she uttered.  You looked at her questioningly, waiting for an answer.  \u201cI came to say goodbye\u2026\u201d </p><p>You froze into place, suddenly struck by a feeling of dread. She probably noticed the sudden pallor of your face because she explained calmly :  \u201cThey will come for me\u2026\u201d  </p><p>You swallowed with difficulty as you heart sped up inexplicably. Of course they would. It shouldn\u2019t even shock you. They would probably lock her away too. And who knew what would happen to her after that.  \u201cWhen ?\u201d you murmured, your voice barely audible.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d she answered with her accent that had made you dizzy so many times before. \u201cSoon probably. I wanted to see you one last time before that.\u201d  </p><p>New tears came to your eyes, but for a whole other reason this time.  \u201cYou could run\u2026\u201d you suggested.  </p><p>A tiny smile stretched her lips but it didn\u2019t really last, nor did it reach her eyes. An indescribable sadness crossed her gaze as she said :  \u201cRunning was always more my brother\u2019s style, no ?\u201d  </p><p>You simply nodded, not knowing what to say. She had lost someone too for the sake of the Avengers. But before you could think more about it, she took a step back, finding herself out of your flat once again.  </p><p>You could still see her, very clearly, like she was always meant to be in your sight, but somehow, it seemed like she had already left a long time ago. That\u2019s when you knew that she indeed hadn\u2019t come to beg for forgiveness. She had really come for a goodbye. At the very moment she had knocked on your door, she was actually already gone. And so you let her.  She looked at you one last time, her light green eyes brushing over every feature of yours, like she wanted to memorize your face perfectly. Like she would never see it again. In a certain way, you did just the same, wondering how things could have turned this way. You wanted to say something so badly, but nothing came out, and it was her who spoke.  \u201cTake care of yourself, Y/N.\u201d she murmured softly.  </p><p>You didn\u2019t reply. You didn\u2019t move. You just stood there as she went away, leaving you alone like you had told her to when she had first arrived.  Your first thought was that your flat had strangely got a lot colder. The second was that it wasn\u2019t something a hot drink would fix this time. And the last, that you should have said goodbye too.</p>",

The gif is not mine !</b></p><p><b>Summary : Your best friend was killed by the explosion caused by Wanda in Lagos. Will you be able to forgive her and hold on to your feelings or will you let her walk away ?</b></p><p><b>Warning : This is kind of sad so don&rsquo;t read if you don&rsquo;t want the feels !</b></p><p>You took a gulp of your hot drink, trying to stop your hands from shaking. The beverage burned your tongue but you welcomed the distraction without a wince. You put the cup down on the kitchen counter with a soft thud. The only sound that filled the room was the incessant ticking noise of the clock on the wall. You picked up your phone and flipped it open. Steve had called you earlier but you had ignored it, not in the mood to talk about anything. You pressed a button to hear the voicemail and soon, his soothing voice echoed in the empty room.  &ldquo;Hey Y/N&hellip; I just wanted to see how you were holding up, just checking in&hellip;&rdquo;  He paused and you heard only silence for a few seconds. You first thought that it was it but then, he added :  &ldquo;Also&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry. About everything.&rdquo;  </p><p>Your chest tightened at his words and you instantly hung up, not wanting to know if he had something else to say. You held back your tears, feeling like a spear was stuck in your chest. How could that have happened ? Just&hellip;how ? She had been your best friend for years, and when you joined S.H.I.E.L.D., she was actually worried about your safety. Little did she know that she would be the first to go&hellip; As a journalist, her job had always been everything but dangerous. But that was before she went to Lagos for her paper&hellip;  You heard a soft knock on the door, interrupting your thoughts. You didn&rsquo;t bulge, hoping that they would simply go away. It was most probably one of your neighbours wanting some milk. But you didn&rsquo;t want to cross your small apartment for that. But when a second knock echoed, you sighed before getting up tiredly and going to the door. You checked through the peephole and recoiled immediately as you recognised who was on the landing. You considered the idea of pretending you weren&rsquo;t home but it was useless.  </p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re in there&hellip;&rdquo; she said, her sokovian accent making its way to your ears.  You pressed your lips in a tight line, breathing carefully through your nose. Slowly, you grabbed the door handle and pulled on it, your breath catching in your throat as you met Wanda&rsquo;s gaze. She looked miserable, her eyes glistening with unshed tears, her long brown hair in a mess. But judging by how her face fell when she laid eyes on you, you knew you probably looked worse.  </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you here ?&rdquo; you managed to ask, your voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>She stared at you in silence before saying lightly :  &ldquo;I wanted to see you&hellip;&rdquo;  </p><p>You nodded blankly, hoping she would just go away. She was only making this more difficult, more painful.  &ldquo;Well, you just did, so&hellip;&rdquo;  You began to close the door but she raised her hand in a defensive manner, stopping you.  &ldquo;Wait !&rdquo;  You stopped mid-movement, repressing a sigh. She was now fumbling with her hands, her big eyes searching your face for something she would most probably not find. You wondered what they were all up to now at S.H.I.E.L.D&rsquo;S headquarters. Surely the explosion caused by Wanda in Nigeria had brought a whole lot of problems on them. But you personally had other things on your mind. Like going to your friend&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s house to tell her that her child wouldn&rsquo;t make it home this time. And then you had gotten back to your own place to try and wrap your mind around the fact that you would never see your best friend again. All because of a stupid mistake&hellip;  </p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she blurted out, her voice shaking slightly.  </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t say anything, you just kept looking at her small frame in the entrance of your flat. She recoiled slightly, noticing your uneasy silence. She continued though, her voice cracking from the emotion. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean for any of this to happen, I&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think you should go.&rdquo; you said flatly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, please !&rdquo; she exclaimed as you were closing the door again. She took a small step inside, causing you to back away just a bit to keep some distance between the two of you. &ldquo;Tell me what I can do to fix this !&rdquo; </p><p>You flinched at her words and you replied with more strength than before :  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t <i>fix</i> it !
