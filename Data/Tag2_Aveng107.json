        "question": "Hello! Steve and Nat have an awesome friendship built from trust and acceptance. I noticed in IW they are simply in sync with each other, obviously in tune with the other. Do you think they could start a romantic relationship in Endgame? I couldn't help but notice that Nat didn't seem all too warm to Bruce in their reunion. In fact, they panned the camera to Steve and Natasha, making it seem like there might be something there? It almost looked like a love triangle? What are your predictions?",
        "answer": "<p>Hi, anon! Thank\u00a0you for your interest in reading my theories ^^</p><p>I agree with you completely. I even wrote lengthy meta posts about them (which you can find <a href=\"http://roaminginspiration.tumblr.com/post/173388019540/hey-guys-this-is-a-spoiler-free-post-i\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://roaminginspiration.tumblr.com/post/174413134465/what-do-we-know-so-far-in-regards-to-nat-and-steve\">here </a>and <a href=\"http://roaminginspiration.tumblr.com/post/177344246402/this-is-a-little-analysis-i-came-up-with-last\">here</a>).</p><p>I see two reasons for all this:</p><p>1/ Romanogers has been hinted at \u2014 subtly enough not to interfere with the events of IW or spoil Endgame\u00a0but visible enough not to look like their relationship is coming out of the blue in the final film. Infinity War was very much about making couples canon (ScarletVision and Starmora) and it would seem logical that the Russos would want Romanogers to get the same treatment. Considering they were barely in the movie, it would make sense that they decided to put it off until Endgame. However, it is important to note that the underlying theme for these couples was sacrifice: does it mean Romanogers will get it too? Or is their romance saved for later because their fate diverge\u00a0from this pattern? Just some food for thought. ^^</p><p>\u00a02/ Romanogers is already canon but is and will remain understated. If that is the case, then we can only expect other cinematographic clues and hints like the ones we\u2019ve been getting since CATWS.</p><p>Personally, that would leave me hungry for more. And somehow I doubt that the Russo brothers would simply leave it at that after dropping so many hints and developing\u00a0their relationship across four movies only to keep it implicit in the end. And they did warn that Endgame would be the conclusion of an arc started in CATWS which is very personal to them.
