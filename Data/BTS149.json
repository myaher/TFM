This sneak peek is 2k, but it sets up the story even if you haven&rsquo;t read the backstory..which is kinda confusing I\u2019ll admit lol. So this gives you a clearer understanding also Jin is not in this part but he\u2019s in part 1 \u00a0)</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"556\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"suggamiin:JMsu5VDq8w4jA3hfpkyYfg:ZejA5y2bA9N6b\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40047445fd616d6a8b6ff65fdc7e96ba/tumblr_pdynfhRmOp1qe8wvfo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"556\"/></figure><p><b>P.S. -There is no smut in the sneak peek but there is in the full portion of part 1!</b></p><p><i>Pulling up to the studio the car you guys arrived in was completely blacked out, it was around noon once you guys got there after dropping everything off at the hotel. You\u2019d be lying if you said you guys weren\u2019t exhausted though, it was a 14 hour flight non stop from New York which is where you guys were last for a show at Gramercy Theater. You all almost looking as if you coordinated to dress alike, all having on a variation of the same basic outfit which consisted of,high waisted leggings a cropped oversized hoodie/sweatshirt and short Bailey bow uggs, and huge sunglasses. BUT in your defense you did just do the Today show, a private MTV mini acoustic set, a concert and then hopped on a flight. Now just landing in Korea, doing a couple vocal warm ups on the way to the studio as the flight didn\u2019t do any of your voices justice. Shooting a quick text to RM letting him know you guys were pulling up as he was the main one you were all communicating with, it wasn\u2019t long before he was at the door, accompanied by Jhope. \u00a0It appeared the door was key coded, so you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get in without them anyway.<b><br/></b></i></p><p><i>They were both dressed pretty causal J opting for a black fitted jogger set, not sure at a quick glance the brand and a black baseball cap. All of the longer pieces of his dark locks were tucked in only leaving his sideburns. While a couple small diamonds danced along his ears .There was just something really sexy about seeing him in just chill, I guess almost boyfriend like outfits since in Kpop they are always dressed to the nines whenever they perform.Even though you really didn&rsquo;t know him, just from what you\u2019ve seen this was a good change of pace. RM\u2019s just keeping it simple in a pair of black jeans a gray sweater and a black beanie. Once you hopped out of the car, and the door to the building shut behind you, you were greeted with hugs. The two making their rounds to all of you, the conversation was pretty generic\u201d How are you, how was the flight?\u201d Blah blah blah .You noticed J almost purposely came to you last. His hands snaked around your waist, when he pulled you in, it lingered, a lot longer than it did with the other girls. It was clearly noticeable if anyone was paying attention but no one said anything . \u201cHow are you feelin? How was your flight?\u201d Too arrogant to admit it but you actually loved the sound of his voice, by now all of the boys were about as fluent as RM in English. They\u2019ve also all improved honestly but they still held a slight accent when they spoke . Now that J was able to speak the language more fluently and more importantly he was COMFORTABLE \u00a0his tone was able to readjust more to the base he held while speaking in his native tongue. </i></p><p><i>His breath hit the side of your neck as you tried not to shiver while he pulled back from the hug \u201cI mean If I\u2019m being real with you, I\u2019m fucking beat right now. No joke..everyyyything hurts\u2026.But I\u2019m grateful for what I do\u2026 and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way\u2026\u201d You smiled back at him lazily as you tried to shake your jetlag. \u00a0In which he returned with a nood his warm smile causing his eyes to crinkle as he rubbed your shoulder gently. A slight moan leaving your lips on accident, your muscles were so tense and his hands felt so good. He noticed the second his hand touched your skin what your issue was \u201cShit your muscles are tight\u201d It hit the back of your neck in the form of a whisper initially as the grip on your shoulder tightened and you winced at the pressure \u201cYou need to take better care of that, I know you no better\u201d His tone almost came out as if he was reprimanding you. Part of you thinking ..you got a lotta nerve&hellip;but you knew he was right. So instead You nodded letting out a slow exhale, he was right usually you would get a massage or sometimes you guys would massage each other you just didn&rsquo;t have time. You were all still in the entry way as Rm got distracted in random conversation with the girls, from what you could hear just filling him in on the crazy 48 hours you guys just had. Finally disconnecting from the conversation he lead you towards long hallway that led to the elevator. As you started to follow the group, \u00a0you felt his \u00a0hands gently reconnect to the pressure points in your back massaging the area gently as you walked over to the elevator. Faint moans left your lips as he eased your pain, they weren\u2019t filled with an ulterior motive you were just hurting in all honesty. But he\u2019d be lying if he said they weren\u2019t having an affect on him as he tried to muffle his own, loving the way your body reacted to him, even with just his innocent touch.You two never really talked, it was always brief always at a loud event but it wasn\u2019t a secret that his eye always caught your glance and vise versa.</i></p><!-- more --><p><i>Upon stepping onto the elevator you two separated, not wanting to draw attention to how you two suddenly were very..comfortable with each other. He did however grab your baby pink Birkin, it was a 40 and stuffed, after feeling how tight your muscles were he decided you were not carrying that thing. No one said anything about that though, just assuming it was a kind gesture. RM actually grabbed a spare bag Jade had as well as for some reason she also had 2 backpacks with her. Following RM\u2019s lead down the hallway to the studio space once getting off the elevator he entered the room first while the rest of you followed. Hoseok was at the end of the line right behind you, you could feel is eyes on you the entire time, you always kinda figured he was a ass guy. Well clearly you were right your heathered gray high waisted legging that cinched in your waist and accentuated your thighs and ass clearly working in your favor, Maybe you wore them on purpose..maybe not\u2026 You glanced over your shoulder and you watched him quickly try to look away. His cheeks almost turning red, as he couldn\u2019t help but smile down at himself. Once you all entered the room you were greeted by smiling faces and warm hugs. To your surprise it was only RM, Suga,J, Jimin, Jungkook, and Taehyung, and by only I mean..I guess because you know things are done a little differently in Kpop and slightly more strict. To be honest you were shocked when the labels proposed the collab. Regardless to BTS being the biggest thing to come out of BigHit you weren\u2019t sure if they gave them the freedom to just record first with no other people or opinions around. Of course you were pleasantly surprised!</i></p><p><i>\u201cWait..Im so confused\u2026\u201d Jungkook looked over at you as you started to get settled, taking off your jackets, purses, sunglasses ETC. None of you sure what exactly he was talking about or who he was talking to but you decided to speak up \u201cWhatcha talkin bout kookie?\u201d He furrowed in his brows as if you should have just known what he meant \u201cSpit it out already!\u201d Yoongi sputtered from across the room earning a cackle from all of you \u00a0while Jungkook brushed off his comments still taking his time \u201cThere\u2019s..four, there\u2019s always been four \u2026when you Google you guys..there\u2019s four..\u201d Now you were confused but Caitlyn wasn\u2019t \u201cOhhhhhhhhh\u201d A slight giggle leaving her lips after putting two and two together \u201cHe\u2019s referring to Miki\u2026\u201d Letting her eyes meet yours \u201cWHAT?\u201d The squawk came from the back \u00a0of the studio as she sat in the corner plugging her Iphone in to charge \u201cOh no baby we\u2019re not talking to you were just talking about you!\u201d Your tone laced in sarcasm as she was quick to roll her eyes and flick you off in which you were not even phased by. \u201cThat\u2019s her little sister\u2026and our assistant\u201d Jade added with a slight smile as she took a seat on the couch by Taehyung.</i></p><p><i>At that point everyone was confused because you two have slight similarities but not much and skin tone was a big difference. The silence in the room after Jades comment gave it away,you two shared the same dad but not mom. Her mom was German while yours was Nigerian. \u201cStep sister, we share a Frenchie for a father, I\u2019m assuming the difference in pigmentation is throwing you all off?\u201c \u00a0A slight smirk moving up her face as she looked over at you. \u201cUhh yeah and the accent actually, okay how about we make this easy, because I mean we\u2019ve talked briefly in passing at like,loud ass award shows. But besides us knowing we like your music that\u2019s about all we know. Joon\u2019s been the main one talking to Mila, before you guys came soooo\u2026\u201d Those words came from Jimin, even though I don\u2019t think he was done talking I just think he got distracted by Caitlyn as she walked by. She was the tiniest in the group; barley 5\u20194, she was also Korean but she had a very warm olive complexion to her skin, the girl was \u00a0solid..all ass and thighs, due to being so tiny she carries weight a lot easier, so she\u2019s definitely the gym rat of the group, all muscle. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>You picked up on it right away and couldn\u2019t help but smirk down at yourself \u201cSo what were doing intros across the room?\u201d Once your eyes met the boys they all kinda just shrugged semly slightly intrigued by the idea\u2026\u201dOkay well, I\u2019ll go first since I\u2019m the only Asian in this group, I\u2019m Caitlyn I think that\u2019s the only thing you all do known, My parents are both Korean, I was born in Germany. I\u2019ve known Mimi since we were 7 both of our parents in the same military base so we typically relocated together. I spent the majority of my teen years in louisiana, which is where my accents from\u2026.so ugh\u2026yeah..your turn white girl!\u201d Letting her eyes meet Jade\u2019s with a wink as she readjusted next to Tae who already had her undivided attention the boy was damn near drooling honestly, \u201cWell I mean\u2026\u201d Jokily throwing on a very thick valley girl accent as she flipped her blonde locks, the guys didn\u2019t catch it but you all did, as you all almost snorted in response \u201cGod I can\u2019t stand you\u201d Nicole rolled her eyes playfully \u00a0from the back of the room where she sat next to Miki \u201cNo I\u2019m joking, they call me white girl as a joke, my dad\u2019s French my moms 100% Cuban but to most people.. I don\u2019t look Latina at all\u2026I mean my hips, and my slight watered down accent which is more so Miami based than anything but yeah. I\u2019m half Cuban, the blonde hair and green eyes dont show it though! I was actually born in London I spent 6 years there, but my family did not travel anywhere near as much as the other girls. And ugh yeah I think that\u2019s about all she wrote,I can\u2019t think of anything else worth mentioning right now\u201d Ending with a slight sigh as she leaned back against the couch letting her eyes meet Taehyung\u2019s \u201cYou have really beautiful eyes by the way\u201d His glance met hers almost as if he forgot you were all there! \u201cOh my god thank you!\u201d Hoseok spoke up placing both hands over his heart with a smile.Taehyung couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he started to get slightly shy actually I don\u2019t think he meant to blurt that out or at least not so loud. \u00a0\u2018Anytime man, anytime!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWellllll..I guess it\u2019s my turn\u201d Nicole skipped towards the front of the room her curls bouncing as she walked Taking a set on the ledge of control desk adjacent to Jungkook \u201cI\u2019m Nicole, I\u2019m your favorite hot blooded Italian..No in all honesty I\u2019m really chill\u201d That comment alone made you gag on your coffee \u201cYeah okay..\u201dYour lashes fluttered up at her as you couldn\u2019t even believe she actually put that sentence together. \u201cOh fuck you I\u2019m chill until I get pissed\u201d Yoongi\u2019s face scrunched in \u00a0as he tried to suppress his laughter \u201cWell I mean aren\u2019t we all..\u201d His response was met with a slight sigh as she tried to pretend like she didn\u2019t wanna smile \u201c Ya know, I\u2019m feelin very attacked right now!\u201d Pausing dramatically placing her hand over her chest \u201cI think you\u2019ll make it..\u201d \u00a0The quick wink you shot at her , only had you begging for her to tell you to go fuck yourself \u201cRude, okay where was I\u2026\u201d&ndash; \u201cYou just finished telling us how your like..really chill..\u201d Jungkooks voice almost coming out as if he was taunting her when he said that, which in return actually earned him a smirk as Nicole loved sarcasm. \u201cOh yeah and then there&rsquo;s that&hellip;OH , I\u2019m actually the only one born in the states\u2026I was born in Staten Island, buttt I actually spent about 4 years in Japan actually\u2026.something that they all seemed to have left out, is we all ended up at the same high school, that\u2019s how we met. Besides Mimi and Caitlyn we met when we were like 15, Also random but I\u2019m the only girl in the group without tattoos but I mean I have a million piercings between my ears, nose and other places so I guess..it evens out\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s brow kicking up immediately \u00a0as his face was screaming curiosity as his caught the \u201cAnd other places\u201d</i></p><p><i>You knew he wanted to ask soooo bad what her \u201cOther places\u201d were. \u201cYeah I actually just noticed you all have your noses pierced! \u201c Yoongi squinted a little as his eyes met all of your faces \u201cOh yeah..we actually did that the first time we ever hung out, we skipped and used fake ID\u2019s to get them done!\u201d Jade added with a cheeky smile \u201cWait seriously? \u201c Taehyung looked shocked,and amused all at the same time , probably because she looked so innocent, her oversized hoodie covering the half sleeve on her arm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh wait so all of parents are in the Military?\u201d You all almost did a double take at the sound of his voice he was so focused mixing something that you could tell he was listening but not like fully engaged in the conversation. \u00a0\u201cMMmmhmm..I guess I\u2019ll end it then\u2026I think you guys..\u201d Referring to the boys \u201cAll know me as Mila but the girls and a lot of our fans call me Mimi, I answer to both. I\u2019ve lived in Paris, I was actually born there..Caitlyn and myself have probably traveled the most but I most of my..older years were sent in \u00a0Louisiana . My accent is..well.. kinda a mixture in my opinion, a watered down combo of Southern Cajun/Creole my mom grew up in the deep Bayous of Louisiana so when my dad was on short leaves that\u2019s were we\u2019d stay\u2026and yes \u2026I always sound like I\u2019m getting over a sore throat. The flight didn\u2019t fuck me up that bad.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as you cleared your throat, you were feeling a little dry but your voice was naturally husky, always \u201cNo I like it\u2026it\u2019s different..calming actually\u2026\u201d Hoseok\u2019s words came out slow as he was now always working on something at another station, breaking his gaze from the monitor to meet yours with a smile. Thank god for your melanin coming through slightly disguising how red your cheeks were turning.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0\u201cThank you\u2026umm OH yeah\u2026we already discussed the one back Joon that\u2019s my baby sister Miki, she\u2019s 22 by the way\u2026\u201d Purposely pausing to make eye contact with Namjoon as he tried to ignore you even though that deep dimple was betraying him, he\u2019s been glancing over at her since she walked in but she\u2019s been too zoned out to notice. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Do you see what I see Mimi?\u201d Jungkook poked Namjoons cheek only making it turn even more red. \u201cAWW\u201d Jimin poked his lips out from across the room . \u201cWait\u2026\u201d Caitlyn chimed in scrunching her nose as she appeared to be in deep thought \u201cIsn\u2019t she 21!?\u201d Letting her glance meet yours as you actually had to sit and think for a minute how old she actually was \u201cHey Namjoon, that\u2019s my baby sister she\u2019s 21 by the way..\u201d A sly smirked moved up your face as you kicked your brow in amusement. Repeating the same phrase as if you didn&rsquo;t just fuck it up a couple minutes prior. Which earned a slight chuckle from him before pulling his beanie halfway down his face, as if that would make him disappear \u201c Oh don\u2019t worry\u2026 I didn\u2019t do you that dirty she has her headphone on full blast she can\u2019t hear shit! But yeah I don\u2019t know, were Minx\u2019s we put yourself together started out almost, 4 years ago now making youtube vids. We got signed almost 2 years ago, released an EP last year, and \u00a0we just finished our album that\u2019s coming out next year and we\u2019re pretty fucking excited.\u201d \u00a0The four of you couldn\u2019t help but squeal at the idea, you\u2019ve been working so hard and it\u2019s been really paying off this past year. This was all still fresh to you, the concerts \u00a0the fans, I mean yes Youtube is a HUGE platform so even before getting signed you guys did meet and greets and shows. I mean your channel had 1 million subscribers before getting signed. But everything is just on a larger scale now.</i></p><p><i>When your latest single Egotistic came out it was your first billboard number 1, and on top of that it charted well EVERYWHERE, which is how you guys ended up in a studio with with BTS. Jhope and Jimin were actually dancing to the song in a Vlive, and to your surprise you guys shared a lot of fans, who were actually rooting for a collab. After it charted so well in Asia, your label suggested doing a remix with the boys in Korean, and English as your all very fluent in multiple languages. To your surprise the boys were already fans of your music after seeing you perform at the BBMA earlier this year which was actually your first time meeting in person. \u00a0Spending the past 2 weeks working on the collab via emails and voice memos now you guys are here for 3 days to record the song , and for your first ever sold out show in Asia on Sunday.</i></p><p><i>\u2018You guys are really talented, you\u2019d definitely give some of our girlgroups out here a run for their money\u201d Jungkook let his eyes meet Nicole with a cocky smirk while she tried, emphasis on the TRIED to act like she wasn\u2019t flustered \u201cI dont know there\u2019s enough room for all of us, I guess because you guys have so many girl groups, we were shocked that we sparked interest\u201d Caitlyn\u2019s words resonated pretty deep, you all actually cried at the idea of coming over there really aren\u2019t any girl groups in American right now, but Kpop has a ton, and there all talented. Jimin\u2019s face showed he was almost annoyed by what she said \u201cUgh yeah, because we like talent, simple as that, incase you forgot you guys go on stage in shoes that look like stilts, dance and ACTUALLY sing LIVE..\u201d The emphasis on the \u201cActually\u201d and \u201cLive\u201d Made the whole room erupt in laughter as you already knew what he was referring too but nothing more needed to be said about it,</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut all bullshit aside,I know we need to get moving I feel like we spent a hour just talking and we have a lot of do in regards to this song. But we really appreciate you guys wanting to work with us..we\u2019ve been big fans for yours. You guys are killing it have been since day one, and doing it with SUCH class it\u2019s insane. Just know we really appreciate this\u2026.and were so excited to get this remix out for the world to hear..and hopefully they love it!\u201d</i></p><p><b>OBVIOUSLY LOL there\u2019s no smut in this sneak peek but in the full part 1 there will be . I think If there&rsquo;s interest and I continue this..I will do 3 parts to get it from getting long.</b></p><h2><b>Part 1 -(Sub focus Jimin/Caitlyn)\u00a0 It will span the girls recording the song and their performance in Korea so basically the 3 day weekend that\u2019s reference in this!

You all almost looking as if you coordinated to dress alike, all having on a variation of the same basic outfit which consisted of,high waisted leggings a cropped oversized hoodie/sweatshirt and short Bailey bow uggs, and huge sunglasses. BUT in your defense you did just do the Today show, a private MTV mini acoustic set, a concert and then hopped on a flight. Now just landing in Korea, doing a couple vocal warm ups on the way to the studio as the flight didn&rsquo;t do any of your voices justice. Shooting a quick text to RM letting him know you guys were pulling up as he was the main one you were all communicating with, it wasn&rsquo;t long before he was at the door, accompanied by Jhope. &nbsp;It appeared the door was key coded, so you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get in without them anyway.<b><br></b></i></p>\n<p><i>They were both dressed pretty causal J opting for a black fitted jogger set, not sure at a quick glance the brand and a black baseball cap.

RM&rsquo;s just keeping it simple in a pair of black jeans a gray sweater and a black beanie. Once you hopped out of the car, and the door to the building shut behind you, you were greeted with hugs.

His hands snaked around your waist, when he pulled you in, it lingered, a lot longer than it did with the other girls. It was clearly noticeable if anyone was paying attention but no one said anything . &ldquo;How are you feelin? How was your flight?&rdquo; Too arrogant to admit it but you actually loved the sound of his voice, by now all of the boys were about as fluent as RM in English. They&rsquo;ve also all improved honestly but they still held a slight accent when they spoke . Now that J was able to speak the language more fluently and more importantly he was COMFORTABLE &nbsp;his tone was able to readjust more to the base he held while speaking in his native tongue. </i></p>\n<p><i>His breath hit the side of your neck as you tried not to shiver while he pulled back from the hug &ldquo;I mean If I&rsquo;m being real with you, I&rsquo;m fucking beat right now.

A slight moan leaving your lips on accident, your muscles were so tense and his hands felt so good. He noticed the second his hand touched your skin what your issue was &ldquo;Shit your muscles are tight&rdquo; It hit the back of your neck in the form of a whisper initially as the grip on your shoulder tightened and you winced at the pressure &ldquo;You need to take better care of that, I know you no better&rdquo; His tone almost came out as if he was reprimanding you. Part of you thinking ..you got a lotta nerve&hellip;but you knew he was right. So instead You nodded letting out a slow exhale, he was right usually you would get a massage or sometimes you guys would massage each other you just didn&rsquo;t have time. You were all still in the entry way as Rm got distracted in random conversation with the girls, from what you could hear just filling him in on the crazy 48 hours you guys just had. Finally disconnecting from the conversation he lead you towards long hallway that led to the elevator. As you started to follow the group, &nbsp;you felt his &nbsp;hands gently reconnect to the pressure points in your back massaging the area gently as you walked over to the elevator.

He did however grab your baby pink Birkin, it was a 40 and stuffed, after feeling how tight your muscles were he decided you were not carrying that thing. No one said anything about that though, just assuming it was a kind gesture. RM actually grabbed a spare bag Jade had as well as for some reason she also had 2 backpacks with her. Following RM\u2019s lead down the hallway to the studio space once getting off the elevator he entered the room first while the rest of you followed. Hoseok was at the end of the line right behind you, you could feel is eyes on you the entire time, you always kinda figured he was a ass guy. Well clearly you were right your heathered gray high waisted legging that cinched in your waist and accentuated your thighs and ass clearly working in your favor, Maybe you wore them on purpose..maybe not\u2026 You glanced over your shoulder and you watched him quickly try to look away. His cheeks almost turning red, as he couldn\u2019t help but smile down at himself. Once you all entered the room you were greeted by smiling faces and warm hugs. To your surprise it was only RM, Suga,J, Jimin, Jungkook, and Taehyung, and by only I mean..I guess because you know things are done a little differently in Kpop and slightly more strict. To be honest you were shocked when the labels proposed the collab. Regardless to BTS being the biggest thing to come out of BigHit you weren\u2019t sure if they gave them the freedom to just record first with no other people or opinions around. Of course you were pleasantly surprised!</i></p><p><i>\u201cWait..Im so confused\u2026\u201d Jungkook looked over at you as you started to get settled, taking off your jackets, purses, sunglasses ETC. None of you sure what exactly he was talking about or who he was talking to but you decided to speak up \u201cWhatcha talkin bout kookie?\u201d He furrowed in his brows as if you should have just known what he meant \u201cSpit it out already!\u201d Yoongi sputtered from across the room earning a cackle from all of you \u00a0while Jungkook brushed off his comments still taking his time \u201cThere\u2019s..four, there\u2019s always been four \u2026when you Google you guys..there\u2019s four..\u201d Now you were confused but Caitlyn wasn\u2019t \u201cOhhhhhhhhh\u201d A slight giggle leaving her lips after putting two and two together \u201cHe\u2019s referring to Miki\u2026\u201d Letting her eyes meet yours \u201cWHAT?\u201d The squawk came from the back \u00a0of the studio as she sat in the corner plugging her Iphone in to charge \u201cOh no baby we\u2019re not talking to you were just talking about you!\u201d Your tone laced in sarcasm as she was quick to roll her eyes and flick you off in which you were not even phased by. \u201cThat\u2019s her little sister\u2026and our assistant\u201d Jade added with a slight smile as she took a seat on the couch by Taehyung.</i></p><p><i>At that point everyone was confused because you two have slight similarities but not much and skin tone was a big difference. The silence in the room after Jades comment gave it away,you two shared the same dad but not mom. Her mom was German while yours was Nigerian. \u201cStep sister, we share a Frenchie for a father, I\u2019m assuming the difference in pigmentation is throwing you all off?\u201c \u00a0A slight smirk moving up her face as she looked over at you. \u201cUhh yeah and the accent actually, okay how about we make this easy, because I mean we\u2019ve talked briefly in passing at like,loud ass award shows. But besides us knowing we like your music that\u2019s about all we know. Joon\u2019s been the main one talking to Mila, before you guys came soooo\u2026\u201d Those words came from Jimin, even though I don\u2019t think he was done talking I just think he got distracted by Caitlyn as she walked by. She was the tiniest in the group; barley 5\u20194, she was also Korean but she had a very warm olive complexion to her skin, the girl was \u00a0solid..all ass and thighs, due to being so tiny she carries weight a lot easier, so she\u2019s definitely the gym rat of the group, all muscle. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>You picked up on it right away and couldn\u2019t help but smirk down at yourself \u201cSo what were doing intros across the room?\u201d Once your eyes met the boys they all kinda just shrugged semly slightly intrigued by the idea\u2026\u201dOkay well, I\u2019ll go first since I\u2019m the only Asian in this group, I\u2019m Caitlyn I think that\u2019s the only thing you all do known, My parents are both Korean, I was born in Germany. I\u2019ve known Mimi since we were 7 both of our parents in the same military base so we typically relocated together. I spent the majority of my teen years in louisiana, which is where my accents from\u2026.so ugh\u2026yeah..your turn white girl!\u201d Letting her eyes meet Jade\u2019s with a wink as she readjusted next to Tae who already had her undivided attention the boy was damn near drooling honestly, \u201cWell I mean\u2026\u201d Jokily throwing on a very thick valley girl accent as she flipped her blonde locks, the guys didn\u2019t catch it but you all did, as you all almost snorted in response \u201cGod I can\u2019t stand you\u201d Nicole rolled her eyes playfully \u00a0from the back of the room where she sat next to Miki \u201cNo I\u2019m joking, they call me white girl as a joke, my dad\u2019s French my moms 100% Cuban but to most people.. I don\u2019t look Latina at all\u2026I mean my hips, and my slight watered down accent which is more so Miami based than anything but yeah. I\u2019m half Cuban, the blonde hair and green eyes dont show it though! I was actually born in London I spent 6 years there, but my family did not travel anywhere near as much as the other girls. And ugh yeah I think that\u2019s about all she wrote,I can\u2019t think of anything else worth mentioning right now\u201d Ending with a slight sigh as she leaned back against the couch letting her eyes meet Taehyung\u2019s \u201cYou have really beautiful eyes by the way\u201d His glance met hers almost as if he forgot you were all there! \u201cOh my god thank you!\u201d Hoseok spoke up placing both hands over his heart with a smile.Taehyung couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he started to get slightly shy actually I don\u2019t think he meant to blurt that out or at least not so loud. \u00a0\u2018Anytime man, anytime!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWellllll..I guess it\u2019s my turn\u201d Nicole skipped towards the front of the room her curls bouncing as she walked Taking a set on the ledge of control desk adjacent to Jungkook \u201cI\u2019m Nicole, I\u2019m your favorite hot blooded Italian..No in all honesty I\u2019m really chill\u201d That comment alone made you gag on your coffee \u201cYeah okay..\u201dYour lashes fluttered up at her as you couldn\u2019t even believe she actually put that sentence together. \u201cOh fuck you I\u2019m chill until I get pissed\u201d Yoongi\u2019s face scrunched in \u00a0as he tried to suppress his laughter \u201cWell I mean aren\u2019t we all..\u201d His response was met with a slight sigh as she tried to pretend like she didn\u2019t wanna smile \u201c Ya know, I\u2019m feelin very attacked right now!\u201d Pausing dramatically placing her hand over her chest \u201cI think you\u2019ll make it..\u201d \u00a0The quick wink you shot at her , only had you begging for her to tell you to go fuck yourself \u201cRude, okay where was I\u2026\u201d\u2013 \u201cYou just finished telling us how your like..really chill..\u201d Jungkooks voice almost coming out as if he was taunting her when he said that, which in return actually earned him a smirk as Nicole loved sarcasm. \u201cOh yeah and then there\u2019s that\u2026OH , I\u2019m actually the only one born in the states\u2026I was born in Staten Island, buttt I actually spent about 4 years in Japan actually\u2026.something that they all seemed to have left out, is we all ended up at the same high school, that\u2019s how we met. Besides Mimi and Caitlyn we met when we were like 15, Also random but I\u2019m the only girl in the group without tattoos but I mean I have a million piercings between my ears, nose and other places so I guess..it evens out\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s brow kicking up immediately \u00a0as his face was screaming curiosity as his caught the \u201cAnd other places\u201d</i></p><p><i>You knew he wanted to ask soooo bad what her \u201cOther places\u201d were. \u201cYeah I actually just noticed you all have your noses pierced! \u201c Yoongi squinted a little as his eyes met all of your faces \u201cOh yeah..we actually did that the first time we ever hung out, we skipped and used fake ID\u2019s to get them done!\u201d Jade added with a cheeky smile \u201cWait seriously? \u201c Taehyung looked shocked,and amused all at the same time , probably because she looked so innocent, her oversized hoodie covering the half sleeve on her arm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh wait so all of parents are in the Military?\u201d You all almost did a double take at the sound of his voice he was so focused mixing something that you could tell he was listening but not like fully engaged in the conversation. \u00a0\u201cMMmmhmm..I guess I\u2019ll end it then\u2026I think you guys..\u201d Referring to the boys \u201cAll know me as Mila but the girls and a lot of our fans call me Mimi, I answer to both. I\u2019ve lived in Paris, I was actually born there..Caitlyn and myself have probably traveled the most but I most of my..older years were sent in \u00a0Louisiana . My accent is..well.. kinda a mixture in my opinion, a watered down combo of Southern Cajun/Creole my mom grew up in the deep Bayous of Louisiana so when my dad was on short leaves that\u2019s were we\u2019d stay\u2026and yes \u2026I always sound like I\u2019m getting over a sore throat. The flight didn\u2019t fuck me up that bad.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as you cleared your throat, you were feeling a little dry but your voice was naturally husky, always \u201cNo I like it\u2026it\u2019s different..calming actually\u2026\u201d Hoseok\u2019s words came out slow as he was now always working on something at another station, breaking his gaze from the monitor to meet yours with a smile. Thank god for your melanin coming through slightly disguising how red your cheeks were turning.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0\u201cThank you\u2026umm OH yeah\u2026we already discussed the one back Joon that\u2019s my baby sister Miki, she\u2019s 22 by the way\u2026\u201d Purposely pausing to make eye contact with Namjoon as he tried to ignore you even though that deep dimple was betraying him, he\u2019s been glancing over at her since she walked in but she\u2019s been too zoned out to notice. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Do you see what I see Mimi?\u201d Jungkook poked Namjoons cheek only making it turn even more red. \u201cAWW\u201d Jimin poked his lips out from across the room . \u201cWait\u2026\u201d Caitlyn chimed in scrunching her nose as she appeared to be in deep thought \u201cIsn\u2019t she 21!?\u201d Letting her glance meet yours as you actually had to sit and think for a minute how old she actually was \u201cHey Namjoon, that\u2019s my baby sister she\u2019s 21 by the way..\u201d A sly smirked moved up your face as you kicked your brow in amusement. Repeating the same phrase as if you didn\u2019t just fuck it up a couple minutes prior. Which earned a slight chuckle from him before pulling his beanie halfway down his face, as if that would make him disappear \u201c Oh don\u2019t worry\u2026 I didn\u2019t do you that dirty she has her headphone on full blast she can\u2019t hear shit! But yeah I don\u2019t know, were Minx\u2019s we put yourself together started out almost, 4 years ago now making youtube vids. We got signed almost 2 years ago, released an EP last year, and \u00a0we just finished our album that\u2019s coming out next year and we\u2019re pretty fucking excited.\u201d \u00a0The four of you couldn\u2019t help but squeal at the idea, you\u2019ve been working so hard and it\u2019s been really paying off this past year. This was all still fresh to you, the concerts \u00a0the fans, I mean yes Youtube is a HUGE platform so even before getting signed you guys did meet and greets and shows. I mean your channel had 1 million subscribers before getting signed. But everything is just on a larger scale now.</i></p><p><i>When your latest single Egotistic came out it was your first billboard number 1, and on top of that it charted well EVERYWHERE, which is how you guys ended up in a studio with with BTS. Jhope and Jimin were actually dancing to the song in a Vlive, and to your surprise you guys shared a lot of fans, who were actually rooting for a collab. After it charted so well in Asia, your label suggested doing a remix with the boys in Korean, and English as your all very fluent in multiple languages. To your surprise the boys were already fans of your music after seeing you perform at the BBMA earlier this year which was actually your first time meeting in person. \u00a0Spending the past 2 weeks working on the collab via emails and voice memos now you guys are here for 3 days to record the song , and for your first ever sold out show in Asia on Sunday.</i></p><p><i>\u2018You guys are really talented, you\u2019d definitely give some of our girlgroups out here a run for their money\u201d Jungkook let his eyes meet Nicole with a cocky smirk while she tried, emphasis on the TRIED to act like she wasn\u2019t flustered \u201cI dont know there\u2019s enough room for all of us, I guess because you guys have so many girl groups, we were shocked that we sparked interest\u201d Caitlyn\u2019s words resonated pretty deep, you all actually cried at the idea of coming over there really aren\u2019t any girl groups in American right now, but Kpop has a ton, and there all talented. Jimin\u2019s face showed he was almost annoyed by what she said \u201cUgh yeah, because we like talent, simple as that, incase you forgot you guys go on stage in shoes that look like stilts, dance and ACTUALLY sing LIVE..\u201d The emphasis on the \u201cActually\u201d and \u201cLive\u201d Made the whole room erupt in laughter as you already knew what he was referring too but nothing more needed to be said about it,</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut all bullshit aside,I know we need to get moving I feel like we spent a hour just talking and we have a lot of do in regards to this song. But we really appreciate you guys wanting to work with us..we\u2019ve been big fans for yours. You guys are killing it have been since day one, and doing it with SUCH class it\u2019s insane. Just know we really appreciate this\u2026.and were so excited to get this remix out for the world to hear..and hopefully they love it!\u201d</i></p><p><b>OBVIOUSLY LOL there\u2019s no smut in this sneak peek but in the full part 1 there will be . I think If there\u2019s interest and I continue this..I will do 3 parts to get it from getting long.</b></p><h2><b>Part 1 -(Sub focus Jimin/Caitlyn)\u00a0 It will span the girls recording the song and their performance in Korea so basically the 3 day weekend that\u2019s reference in this! (Prob the longest installment)</b></h2><h2><b>Part 2- Will span when they fly back out (About a week or 2 after part 1 ), learn the choreography and film the video</b></h2><h2><b>Part 3- Will be the grand finale when they perform it live at Dick clarks NYE </b></h2><p><b>PAIRINGS (JUST TO CLARIFY)</b></p><p><b>MIMI X J HOPE</b></p><p><b>JADEX X TAEHYUNG</b></p><p><b>CAITLYN X JIMIN</b></p><p><b>NICOLE X JUNGKOOK</b></p><p><b>BONUS- MIKI/NAMJOON (MORE SO IN PART 3 )\u00a0</b></p><p><b><i>ALSO THE COLLAB IS ONLY DANCELINE (PRETTY SURE I HEARD TAE IS OFFICALLY IN DANCELINE NOW) THAT\u2019S WHY MINXS HAS 4 MEMBERS BUT THE REMIX IS BEING PRODUCED BY RM AND SUGA, JIN WILL MAKE A APPERENCE IN THE MV.\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b>But ALL parts will have smut moments, and again there will be moments with the other guys and clearly the girls I\u2019ve connected them too in this intro BUT the main focus IS MILA AND JHOPE moving forward.</b></p></p>",

This sneak peek is 2k, but it sets up the story even if you haven\u2019t read the backstory..which is kinda confusing I\u2019ll admit lol. So this gives you a clearer understanding also Jin is not in this part but he\u2019s in part 1 \u00a0)</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"556\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"suggamiin:JMsu5VDq8w4jA3hfpkyYfg:ZejA5y2bA9N6b\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40047445fd616d6a8b6ff65fdc7e96ba/tumblr_pdynfhRmOp1qe8wvfo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"556\"></figure><p><b>P.S. -There is no smut in the sneak peek but there is in the full portion of part 1!</b></p><p><i>Pulling up to the studio the car you guys arrived in was completely blacked out, it was around noon once you guys got there after dropping everything off at the hotel. You\u2019d be lying if you said you guys weren\u2019t exhausted though, it was a 14 hour flight non stop from New York which is where you guys were last for a show at Gramercy Theater. You all almost looking as if you coordinated to dress alike, all having on a variation of the same basic outfit which consisted of,high waisted leggings a cropped oversized hoodie/sweatshirt and short Bailey bow uggs, and huge sunglasses. BUT in your defense you did just do the Today show, a private MTV mini acoustic set, a concert and then hopped on a flight. Now just landing in Korea, doing a couple vocal warm ups on the way to the studio as the flight didn\u2019t do any of your voices justice. Shooting a quick text to RM letting him know you guys were pulling up as he was the main one you were all communicating with, it wasn\u2019t long before he was at the door, accompanied by Jhope. \u00a0It appeared the door was key coded, so you wouldn\u2019t be able to get in without them anyway.<b><br></b></i></p><p><i>They were both dressed pretty causal J opting for a black fitted jogger set, not sure at a quick glance the brand and a black baseball cap. All of the longer pieces of his dark locks were tucked in only leaving his sideburns. While a couple small diamonds danced along his ears .There was just something really sexy about seeing him in just chill, I guess almost boyfriend like outfits since in Kpop they are always dressed to the nines whenever they perform.Even though you really didn\u2019t know him, just from what you\u2019ve seen this was a good change of pace. RM\u2019s just keeping it simple in a pair of black jeans a gray sweater and a black beanie. Once you hopped out of the car, and the door to the building shut behind you, you were greeted with hugs. The two making their rounds to all of you, the conversation was pretty generic\u201d How are you, how was the flight?\u201d Blah blah blah .You noticed J almost purposely came to you last. His hands snaked around your waist, when he pulled you in, it lingered, a lot longer than it did with the other girls. It was clearly noticeable if anyone was paying attention but no one said anything . \u201cHow are you feelin? How was your flight?\u201d Too arrogant to admit it but you actually loved the sound of his voice, by now all of the boys were about as fluent as RM in English. They\u2019ve also all improved honestly but they still held a slight accent when they spoke . Now that J was able to speak the language more fluently and more importantly he was COMFORTABLE \u00a0his tone was able to readjust more to the base he held while speaking in his native tongue. </i></p><p><i>His breath hit the side of your neck as you tried not to shiver while he pulled back from the hug \u201cI mean If I\u2019m being real with you, I\u2019m fucking beat right now. No joke..everyyyything hurts\u2026.But I\u2019m grateful for what I do\u2026 and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way\u2026\u201d You smiled back at him lazily as you tried to shake your jetlag. \u00a0In which he returned with a nood his warm smile causing his eyes to crinkle as he rubbed your shoulder gently. A slight moan leaving your lips on accident, your muscles were so tense and his hands felt so good. He noticed the second his hand touched your skin what your issue was \u201cShit your muscles are tight\u201d It hit the back of your neck in the form of a whisper initially as the grip on your shoulder tightened and you winced at the pressure \u201cYou need to take better care of that, I know you no better\u201d His tone almost came out as if he was reprimanding you. Part of you thinking ..you got a lotta nerve\u2026but you knew he was right. So instead You nodded letting out a slow exhale, he was right usually you would get a massage or sometimes you guys would massage each other you just didn\u2019t have time. You were all still in the entry way as Rm got distracted in random conversation with the girls, from what you could hear just filling him in on the crazy 48 hours you guys just had. Finally disconnecting from the conversation he lead you towards long hallway that led to the elevator. As you started to follow the group, \u00a0you felt his \u00a0hands gently reconnect to the pressure points in your back massaging the area gently as you walked over to the elevator. Faint moans left your lips as he eased your pain, they weren\u2019t filled with an ulterior motive you were just hurting in all honesty. But he\u2019d be lying if he said they weren\u2019t having an affect on him as he tried to muffle his own, loving the way your body reacted to him, even with just his innocent touch.You two never really talked, it was always brief always at a loud event but it wasn\u2019t a secret that his eye always caught your glance and vise versa.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Upon stepping onto the elevator you two separated, not wanting to draw attention to how you two suddenly were very..comfortable with each other. He did however grab your baby pink Birkin, it was a 40 and stuffed, after feeling how tight your muscles were he decided you were not carrying that thing. No one said anything about that though, just assuming it was a kind gesture. RM actually grabbed a spare bag Jade had as well as for some reason she also had 2 backpacks with her. Following RM\u2019s lead down the hallway to the studio space once getting off the elevator he entered the room first while the rest of you followed. Hoseok was at the end of the line right behind you, you could feel is eyes on you the entire time, you always kinda figured he was a ass guy. Well clearly you were right your heathered gray high waisted legging that cinched in your waist and accentuated your thighs and ass clearly working in your favor, Maybe you wore them on purpose..maybe not\u2026 You glanced over your shoulder and you watched him quickly try to look away. His cheeks almost turning red, as he couldn\u2019t help but smile down at himself. Once you all entered the room you were greeted by smiling faces and warm hugs. To your surprise it was only RM, Suga,J, Jimin, Jungkook, and Taehyung, and by only I mean..I guess because you know things are done a little differently in Kpop and slightly more strict. To be honest you were shocked when the labels proposed the collab. Regardless to BTS being the biggest thing to come out of BigHit you weren\u2019t sure if they gave them the freedom to just record first with no other people or opinions around. Of course you were pleasantly surprised!</i></p><p><i>\u201cWait..Im so confused\u2026\u201d Jungkook looked over at you as you started to get settled, taking off your jackets, purses, sunglasses ETC. None of you sure what exactly he was talking about or who he was talking to but you decided to speak up \u201cWhatcha talkin bout kookie?\u201d He furrowed in his brows as if you should have just known what he meant \u201cSpit it out already!\u201d Yoongi sputtered from across the room earning a cackle from all of you \u00a0while Jungkook brushed off his comments still taking his time \u201cThere\u2019s..four, there\u2019s always been four \u2026when you Google you guys..there\u2019s four..\u201d Now you were confused but Caitlyn wasn\u2019t \u201cOhhhhhhhhh\u201d A slight giggle leaving her lips after putting two and two together \u201cHe\u2019s referring to Miki\u2026\u201d Letting her eyes meet yours \u201cWHAT?\u201d The squawk came from the back \u00a0of the studio as she sat in the corner plugging her Iphone in to charge \u201cOh no baby we\u2019re not talking to you were just talking about you!\u201d Your tone laced in sarcasm as she was quick to roll her eyes and flick you off in which you were not even phased by. \u201cThat\u2019s her little sister\u2026and our assistant\u201d Jade added with a slight smile as she took a seat on the couch by Taehyung.</i></p><p><i>At that point everyone was confused because you two have slight similarities but not much and skin tone was a big difference. The silence in the room after Jades comment gave it away,you two shared the same dad but not mom. Her mom was German while yours was Nigerian. \u201cStep sister, we share a Frenchie for a father, I\u2019m assuming the difference in pigmentation is throwing you all off?\u201c \u00a0A slight smirk moving up her face as she looked over at you. \u201cUhh yeah and the accent actually, okay how about we make this easy, because I mean we\u2019ve talked briefly in passing at like,loud ass award shows. But besides us knowing we like your music that\u2019s about all we know. Joon\u2019s been the main one talking to Mila, before you guys came soooo\u2026\u201d Those words came from Jimin, even though I don\u2019t think he was done talking I just think he got distracted by Caitlyn as she walked by. She was the tiniest in the group; barley 5\u20194, she was also Korean but she had a very warm olive complexion to her skin, the girl was \u00a0solid..all ass and thighs, due to being so tiny she carries weight a lot easier, so she\u2019s definitely the gym rat of the group, all muscle. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>You picked up on it right away and couldn\u2019t help but smirk down at yourself \u201cSo what were doing intros across the room?\u201d Once your eyes met the boys they all kinda just shrugged semly slightly intrigued by the idea\u2026\u201dOkay well, I\u2019ll go first since I\u2019m the only Asian in this group, I\u2019m Caitlyn I think that\u2019s the only thing you all do known, My parents are both Korean, I was born in Germany. I\u2019ve known Mimi since we were 7 both of our parents in the same military base so we typically relocated together. I spent the majority of my teen years in louisiana, which is where my accents from\u2026.so ugh\u2026yeah..your turn white girl!\u201d Letting her eyes meet Jade\u2019s with a wink as she readjusted next to Tae who already had her undivided attention the boy was damn near drooling honestly, \u201cWell I mean\u2026\u201d Jokily throwing on a very thick valley girl accent as she flipped her blonde locks, the guys didn\u2019t catch it but you all did, as you all almost snorted in response \u201cGod I can\u2019t stand you\u201d Nicole rolled her eyes playfully \u00a0from the back of the room where she sat next to Miki \u201cNo I\u2019m joking, they call me white girl as a joke, my dad\u2019s French my moms 100% Cuban but to most people.. I don\u2019t look Latina at all\u2026I mean my hips, and my slight watered down accent which is more so Miami based than anything but yeah. I\u2019m half Cuban, the blonde hair and green eyes dont show it though! I was actually born in London I spent 6 years there, but my family did not travel anywhere near as much as the other girls. And ugh yeah I think that\u2019s about all she wrote,I can\u2019t think of anything else worth mentioning right now\u201d Ending with a slight sigh as she leaned back against the couch letting her eyes meet Taehyung\u2019s \u201cYou have really beautiful eyes by the way\u201d His glance met hers almost as if he forgot you were all there! \u201cOh my god thank you!\u201d Hoseok spoke up placing both hands over his heart with a smile.Taehyung couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he started to get slightly shy actually I don\u2019t think he meant to blurt that out or at least not so loud. \u00a0\u2018Anytime man, anytime!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWellllll..I guess it\u2019s my turn\u201d Nicole skipped towards the front of the room her curls bouncing as she walked Taking a set on the ledge of control desk adjacent to Jungkook \u201cI\u2019m Nicole, I\u2019m your favorite hot blooded Italian..No in all honesty I\u2019m really chill\u201d That comment alone made you gag on your coffee \u201cYeah okay..\u201dYour lashes fluttered up at her as you couldn\u2019t even believe she actually put that sentence together. \u201cOh fuck you I\u2019m chill until I get pissed\u201d Yoongi\u2019s face scrunched in \u00a0as he tried to suppress his laughter \u201cWell I mean aren\u2019t we all..\u201d His response was met with a slight sigh as she tried to pretend like she didn\u2019t wanna smile \u201c Ya know, I\u2019m feelin very attacked right now!\u201d Pausing dramatically placing her hand over her chest \u201cI think you\u2019ll make it..\u201d \u00a0The quick wink you shot at her , only had you begging for her to tell you to go fuck yourself \u201cRude, okay where was I\u2026\u201d\u2013 \u201cYou just finished telling us how your like..really chill..\u201d Jungkooks voice almost coming out as if he was taunting her when he said that, which in return actually earned him a smirk as Nicole loved sarcasm. \u201cOh yeah and then there\u2019s that\u2026OH , I\u2019m actually the only one born in the states\u2026I was born in Staten Island, buttt I actually spent about 4 years in Japan actually\u2026.something that they all seemed to have left out, is we all ended up at the same high school, that\u2019s how we met. Besides Mimi and Caitlyn we met when we were like 15, Also random but I\u2019m the only girl in the group without tattoos but I mean I have a million piercings between my ears, nose and other places so I guess..it evens out\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s brow kicking up immediately \u00a0as his face was screaming curiosity as his caught the \u201cAnd other places\u201d</i></p><p><i>You knew he wanted to ask soooo bad what her \u201cOther places\u201d were. \u201cYeah I actually just noticed you all have your noses pierced! \u201c Yoongi squinted a little as his eyes met all of your faces \u201cOh yeah..we actually did that the first time we ever hung out, we skipped and used fake ID\u2019s to get them done!\u201d Jade added with a cheeky smile \u201cWait seriously? \u201c Taehyung looked shocked,and amused all at the same time , probably because she looked so innocent, her oversized hoodie covering the half sleeve on her arm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh wait so all of parents are in the Military?\u201d You all almost did a double take at the sound of his voice he was so focused mixing something that you could tell he was listening but not like fully engaged in the conversation. \u00a0\u201cMMmmhmm..I guess I\u2019ll end it then\u2026I think you guys..\u201d Referring to the boys \u201cAll know me as Mila but the girls and a lot of our fans call me Mimi, I answer to both. I\u2019ve lived in Paris, I was actually born there..Caitlyn and myself have probably traveled the most but I most of my..older years were sent in \u00a0Louisiana . My accent is..well.. kinda a mixture in my opinion, a watered down combo of Southern Cajun/Creole my mom grew up in the deep Bayous of Louisiana so when my dad was on short leaves that\u2019s were we\u2019d stay\u2026and yes \u2026I always sound like I\u2019m getting over a sore throat. The flight didn\u2019t fuck me up that bad.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as you cleared your throat, you were feeling a little dry but your voice was naturally husky, always \u201cNo I like it\u2026it\u2019s different..calming actually\u2026\u201d Hoseok\u2019s words came out slow as he was now always working on something at another station, breaking his gaze from the monitor to meet yours with a smile. Thank god for your melanin coming through slightly disguising how red your cheeks were turning.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0\u201cThank you\u2026umm OH yeah\u2026we already discussed the one back Joon that\u2019s my baby sister Miki, she\u2019s 22 by the way\u2026\u201d Purposely pausing to make eye contact with Namjoon as he tried to ignore you even though that deep dimple was betraying him, he\u2019s been glancing over at her since she walked in but she\u2019s been too zoned out to notice. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Do you see what I see Mimi?\u201d Jungkook poked Namjoons cheek only making it turn even more red. \u201cAWW\u201d Jimin poked his lips out from across the room . \u201cWait\u2026\u201d Caitlyn chimed in scrunching her nose as she appeared to be in deep thought \u201cIsn\u2019t she 21!?\u201d Letting her glance meet yours as you actually had to sit and think for a minute how old she actually was \u201cHey Namjoon, that\u2019s my baby sister she\u2019s 21 by the way..\u201d A sly smirked moved up your face as you kicked your brow in amusement. Repeating the same phrase as if you didn\u2019t just fuck it up a couple minutes prior. Which earned a slight chuckle from him before pulling his beanie halfway down his face, as if that would make him disappear \u201c Oh don\u2019t worry\u2026 I didn\u2019t do you that dirty she has her headphone on full blast she can\u2019t hear shit! But yeah I don\u2019t know, were Minx\u2019s we put yourself together started out almost, 4 years ago now making youtube vids. We got signed almost 2 years ago, released an EP last year, and \u00a0we just finished our album that\u2019s coming out next year and we\u2019re pretty fucking excited.\u201d \u00a0The four of you couldn\u2019t help but squeal at the idea, you\u2019ve been working so hard and it\u2019s been really paying off this past year. This was all still fresh to you, the concerts \u00a0the fans, I mean yes Youtube is a HUGE platform so even before getting signed you guys did meet and greets and shows. I mean your channel had 1 million subscribers before getting signed. But everything is just on a larger scale now.</i></p><p><i>When your latest single Egotistic came out it was your first billboard number 1, and on top of that it charted well EVERYWHERE, which is how you guys ended up in a studio with with BTS. Jhope and Jimin were actually dancing to the song in a Vlive, and to your surprise you guys shared a lot of fans, who were actually rooting for a collab. After it charted so well in Asia, your label suggested doing a remix with the boys in Korean, and English as your all very fluent in multiple languages. To your surprise the boys were already fans of your music after seeing you perform at the BBMA earlier this year which was actually your first time meeting in person. \u00a0Spending the past 2 weeks working on the collab via emails and voice memos now you guys are here for 3 days to record the song , and for your first ever sold out show in Asia on Sunday.</i></p><p><i>\u2018You guys are really talented, you\u2019d definitely give some of our girlgroups out here a run for their money\u201d Jungkook let his eyes meet Nicole with a cocky smirk while she tried, emphasis on the TRIED to act like she wasn\u2019t flustered \u201cI dont know there\u2019s enough room for all of us, I guess because you guys have so many girl groups, we were shocked that we sparked interest\u201d Caitlyn\u2019s words resonated pretty deep, you all actually cried at the idea of coming over there really aren\u2019t any girl groups in American right now, but Kpop has a ton, and there all talented. Jimin\u2019s face showed he was almost annoyed by what she said \u201cUgh yeah, because we like talent, simple as that, incase you forgot you guys go on stage in shoes that look like stilts, dance and ACTUALLY sing LIVE..\u201d The emphasis on the \u201cActually\u201d and \u201cLive\u201d Made the whole room erupt in laughter as you already knew what he was referring too but nothing more needed to be said about it,</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut all bullshit aside,I know we need to get moving I feel like we spent a hour just talking and we have a lot of do in regards to this song. But we really appreciate you guys wanting to work with us..we\u2019ve been big fans for yours. You guys are killing it have been since day one, and doing it with SUCH class it\u2019s insane.

This sneak peek is 2k, but it sets up the story even if you haven&rsquo;t read the backstory..which is kinda confusing I&rsquo;ll admit lol. So this gives you a clearer understanding also Jin is not in this part but he&rsquo;s in part 1 &nbsp;)</i></b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>P.S. -There is no smut in the sneak peek but there is in the full portion of part 1!</b></p><p><i>Pulling up to the studio the car you guys arrived in was completely blacked out, it was around noon once you guys got there after dropping everything off at the hotel. You&rsquo;d be lying if you said you guys weren&rsquo;t exhausted though, it was a 14 hour flight non stop from New York which is where you guys were last for a show at Gramercy Theater. You all almost looking as if you coordinated to dress alike, all having on a variation of the same basic outfit which consisted of,high waisted leggings a cropped oversized hoodie/sweatshirt and short Bailey bow uggs, and huge sunglasses. BUT in your defense you did just do the Today show, a private MTV mini acoustic set, a concert and then hopped on a flight. Now just landing in Korea, doing a couple vocal warm ups on the way to the studio as the flight didn&rsquo;t do any of your voices justice. Shooting a quick text to RM letting him know you guys were pulling up as he was the main one you were all communicating with, it wasn&rsquo;t long before he was at the door, accompanied by Jhope. &nbsp;It appeared the door was key coded, so you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get in without them anyway.<b><br /></b></i></p><p><i>They were both dressed pretty causal J opting for a black fitted jogger set, not sure at a quick glance the brand and a black baseball cap. All of the longer pieces of his dark locks were tucked in only leaving his sideburns. While a couple small diamonds danced along his ears .There was just something really sexy about seeing him in just chill, I guess almost boyfriend like outfits since in Kpop they are always dressed to the nines whenever they perform.Even though you really didn&rsquo;t know him, just from what you&rsquo;ve seen this was a good change of pace. RM&rsquo;s just keeping it simple in a pair of black jeans a gray sweater and a black beanie. Once you hopped out of the car, and the door to the building shut behind you, you were greeted with hugs. The two making their rounds to all of you, the conversation was pretty generic&rdquo; How are you, how was the flight?&rdquo; Blah blah blah .You noticed J almost purposely came to you last. His hands snaked around your waist, when he pulled you in, it lingered, a lot longer than it did with the other girls. It was clearly noticeable if anyone was paying attention but no one said anything . &ldquo;How are you feelin? How was your flight?&rdquo; Too arrogant to admit it but you actually loved the sound of his voice, by now all of the boys were about as fluent as RM in English. They&rsquo;ve also all improved honestly but they still held a slight accent when they spoke . Now that J was able to speak the language more fluently and more importantly he was COMFORTABLE &nbsp;his tone was able to readjust more to the base he held while speaking in his native tongue. </i></p><p><i>His breath hit the side of your neck as you tried not to shiver while he pulled back from the hug &ldquo;I mean If I&rsquo;m being real with you, I&rsquo;m fucking beat right now. No joke..everyyyything hurts&hellip;.But I&rsquo;m grateful for what I do&hellip; and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way&hellip;&rdquo; You smiled back at him lazily as you tried to shake your jetlag. &nbsp;In which he returned with a nood his warm smile causing his eyes to crinkle as he rubbed your shoulder gently. A slight moan leaving your lips on accident, your muscles were so tense and his hands felt so good. He noticed the second his hand touched your skin what your issue was &ldquo;Shit your muscles are tight&rdquo; It hit the back of your neck in the form of a whisper initially as the grip on your shoulder tightened and you winced at the pressure &ldquo;You need to take better care of that, I know you no better&rdquo; His tone almost came out as if he was reprimanding you. Part of you thinking ..you got a lotta nerve&hellip;but you knew he was right. So instead You nodded letting out a slow exhale, he was right usually you would get a massage or sometimes you guys would massage each other you just didn&rsquo;t have time. You were all still in the entry way as Rm got distracted in random conversation with the girls, from what you could hear just filling him in on the crazy 48 hours you guys just had. Finally disconnecting from the conversation he lead you towards long hallway that led to the elevator. As you started to follow the group, &nbsp;you felt his &nbsp;hands gently reconnect to the pressure points in your back massaging the area gently as you walked over to the elevator. Faint moans left your lips as he eased your pain, they weren&rsquo;t filled with an ulterior motive you were just hurting in all honesty. But he&rsquo;d be lying if he said they weren&rsquo;t having an affect on him as he tried to muffle his own, loving the way your body reacted to him, even with just his innocent touch.You two never really talked, it was always brief always at a loud event but it wasn&rsquo;t a secret that his eye always caught your glance and vise versa.</i></p><p><i>Upon stepping onto the elevator you two separated, not wanting to draw attention to how you two suddenly were very..comfortable with each other. He did however grab your baby pink Birkin, it was a 40 and stuffed, after feeling how tight your muscles were he decided you were not carrying that thing. No one said anything about that though, just assuming it was a kind gesture. RM actually grabbed a spare bag Jade had as well as for some reason she also had 2 backpacks with her. Following RM&rsquo;s lead down the hallway to the studio space once getting off the elevator he entered the room first while the rest of you followed. Hoseok was at the end of the line right behind you, you could feel is eyes on you the entire time, you always kinda figured he was a ass guy. Well clearly you were right your heathered gray high waisted legging that cinched in your waist and accentuated your thighs and ass clearly working in your favor, Maybe you wore them on purpose..maybe not&hellip; You glanced over your shoulder and you watched him quickly try to look away. His cheeks almost turning red, as he couldn&rsquo;t help but smile down at himself. Once you all entered the room you were greeted by smiling faces and warm hugs. To your surprise it was only RM, Suga,J, Jimin, Jungkook, and Taehyung, and by only I mean..I guess because you know things are done a little differently in Kpop and slightly more strict. To be honest you were shocked when the labels proposed the collab. Regardless to BTS being the biggest thing to come out of BigHit you weren&rsquo;t sure if they gave them the freedom to just record first with no other people or opinions around. Of course you were pleasantly surprised!</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wait..Im so confused&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook looked over at you as you started to get settled, taking off your jackets, purses, sunglasses ETC. None of you sure what exactly he was talking about or who he was talking to but you decided to speak up &ldquo;Whatcha talkin bout kookie?&rdquo; He furrowed in his brows as if you should have just known what he meant &ldquo;Spit it out already!&rdquo; Yoongi sputtered from across the room earning a cackle from all of you &nbsp;while Jungkook brushed off his comments still taking his time &ldquo;There&rsquo;s..four, there&rsquo;s always been four &hellip;when you Google you guys..there&rsquo;s four..&rdquo; Now you were confused but Caitlyn wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Ohhhhhhhhh&rdquo; A slight giggle leaving her lips after putting two and two together &ldquo;He&rsquo;s referring to Miki&hellip;&rdquo; Letting her eyes meet yours &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; The squawk came from the back &nbsp;of the studio as she sat in the corner plugging her Iphone in to charge &ldquo;Oh no baby we&rsquo;re not talking to you were just talking about you!&rdquo; Your tone laced in sarcasm as she was quick to roll her eyes and flick you off in which you were not even phased by. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her little sister&hellip;and our assistant&rdquo; Jade added with a slight smile as she took a seat on the couch by Taehyung.</i></p><p><i>At that point everyone was confused because you two have slight similarities but not much and skin tone was a big difference. The silence in the room after Jades comment gave it away,you two shared the same dad but not mom. Her mom was German while yours was Nigerian. &ldquo;Step sister, we share a Frenchie for a father, I&rsquo;m assuming the difference in pigmentation is throwing you all off?&ldquo; &nbsp;A slight smirk moving up her face as she looked over at you. &ldquo;Uhh yeah and the accent actually, okay how about we make this easy, because I mean we&rsquo;ve talked briefly in passing at like,loud ass award shows. But besides us knowing we like your music that&rsquo;s about all we know. Joon&rsquo;s been the main one talking to Mila, before you guys came soooo&hellip;&rdquo; Those words came from Jimin, even though I don&rsquo;t think he was done talking I just think he got distracted by Caitlyn as she walked by. She was the tiniest in the group; barley 5&rsquo;4, she was also Korean but she had a very warm olive complexion to her skin, the girl was &nbsp;solid..all ass and thighs, due to being so tiny she carries weight a lot easier, so she&rsquo;s definitely the gym rat of the group, all muscle. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>You picked up on it right away and couldn&rsquo;t help but smirk down at yourself &ldquo;So what were doing intros across the room?&rdquo; Once your eyes met the boys they all kinda just shrugged semly slightly intrigued by the idea&hellip;&rdquo;Okay well, I&rsquo;ll go first since I&rsquo;m the only Asian in this group, I&rsquo;m Caitlyn I think that&rsquo;s the only thing you all do known, My parents are both Korean, I was born in Germany. I&rsquo;ve known Mimi since we were 7 both of our parents in the same military base so we typically relocated together. I spent the majority of my teen years in louisiana, which is where my accents from&hellip;.so ugh&hellip;yeah..your turn white girl!&rdquo; Letting her eyes meet Jade&rsquo;s with a wink as she readjusted next to Tae who already had her undivided attention the boy was damn near drooling honestly, &ldquo;Well I mean&hellip;&rdquo; Jokily throwing on a very thick valley girl accent as she flipped her blonde locks, the guys didn&rsquo;t catch it but you all did, as you all almost snorted in response &ldquo;God I can&rsquo;t stand you&rdquo; Nicole rolled her eyes playfully &nbsp;from the back of the room where she sat next to Miki &ldquo;No I&rsquo;m joking, they call me white girl as a joke, my dad&rsquo;s French my moms 100% Cuban but to most people.. I don&rsquo;t look Latina at all&hellip;I mean my hips, and my slight watered down accent which is more so Miami based than anything but yeah. I&rsquo;m half Cuban, the blonde hair and green eyes dont show it though! I was actually born in London I spent 6 years there, but my family did not travel anywhere near as much as the other girls. And ugh yeah I think that&rsquo;s about all she wrote,I can&rsquo;t think of anything else worth mentioning right now&rdquo; Ending with a slight sigh as she leaned back against the couch letting her eyes meet Taehyung&rsquo;s &ldquo;You have really beautiful eyes by the way&rdquo; His glance met hers almost as if he forgot you were all there! &ldquo;Oh my god thank you!&rdquo; Hoseok spoke up placing both hands over his heart with a smile.Taehyung couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh as he started to get slightly shy actually I don&rsquo;t think he meant to blurt that out or at least not so loud. &nbsp;&lsquo;Anytime man, anytime!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wellllll..I guess it&rsquo;s my turn&rdquo; Nicole skipped towards the front of the room her curls bouncing as she walked Taking a set on the ledge of control desk adjacent to Jungkook &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nicole, I&rsquo;m your favorite hot blooded Italian..No in all honesty I&rsquo;m really chill&rdquo; That comment alone made you gag on your coffee &ldquo;Yeah okay..&rdquo;Your lashes fluttered up at her as you couldn&rsquo;t even believe she actually put that sentence together. &ldquo;Oh fuck you I&rsquo;m chill until I get pissed&rdquo; Yoongi&rsquo;s face scrunched in &nbsp;as he tried to suppress his laughter &ldquo;Well I mean aren&rsquo;t we all..&rdquo; His response was met with a slight sigh as she tried to pretend like she didn&rsquo;t wanna smile &ldquo; Ya know, I&rsquo;m feelin very attacked right now!&rdquo; Pausing dramatically placing her hand over her chest &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll make it..&rdquo; &nbsp;The quick wink you shot at her , only had you begging for her to tell you to go fuck yourself &ldquo;Rude, okay where was I&hellip;&rdquo;&ndash; &ldquo;You just finished telling us how your like..really chill..&rdquo; Jungkooks voice almost coming out as if he was taunting her when he said that, which in return actually earned him a smirk as Nicole loved sarcasm. &ldquo;Oh yeah and then there&rsquo;s that&hellip;OH , I&rsquo;m actually the only one born in the states&hellip;I was born in Staten Island, buttt I actually spent about 4 years in Japan actually&hellip;.something that they all seemed to have left out, is we all ended up at the same high school, that&rsquo;s how we met.

To your surprise the boys were already fans of your music after seeing you perform at the BBMA earlier this year which was actually your first time meeting in person. &nbsp;Spending the past 2 weeks working on the collab via emails and voice memos now you guys are here for 3 days to record the song , and for your first ever sold out show in Asia on Sunday.</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;You guys are really talented, you&rsquo;d definitely give some of our girlgroups out here a run for their money&rdquo; Jungkook let his eyes meet Nicole with a cocky smirk while she tried, emphasis on the TRIED to act like she wasn&rsquo;t flustered &ldquo;I dont know there&rsquo;s enough room for all of us, I guess because you guys have so many girl groups, we were shocked that we sparked interest&rdquo; Caitlyn&rsquo;s words resonated pretty deep, you all actually cried at the idea of coming over there really aren&rsquo;t any girl groups in American right now, but Kpop has a ton, and there all talented. Jimin&rsquo;s face showed he was almost annoyed by what she said &ldquo;Ugh yeah, because we like talent, simple as that, incase you forgot you guys go on stage in shoes that look like stilts, dance and ACTUALLY sing LIVE..&rdquo; The emphasis on the &ldquo;Actually&rdquo; and &ldquo;Live&rdquo; Made the whole room erupt in laughter as you already knew what he was referring too but nothing more needed to be said about it,</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But all bullshit aside,I know we need to get moving I feel like we spent a hour just talking and we have a lot of do in regards to this song. But we really appreciate you guys wanting to work with us..we&rsquo;ve been big fans for yours. You guys are killing it have been since day one, and doing it with SUCH class it&rsquo;s insane. Just know we really appreciate this&hellip;.and were so excited to get this remix out for the world to hear..and hopefully they love it!&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>OBVIOUSLY LOL there&rsquo;s no smut in this sneak peek but in the full part 1 there will be . I think If there&rsquo;s interest and I continue this..I will do 3 parts to get it from getting long.</b></p><h2><b>Part 1 -(Sub focus Jimin/Caitlyn)&nbsp; It will span the girls recording the song and their performance in Korea so basically the 3 day weekend that&rsquo;s reference in this! (Prob the longest installment)</b></h2><h2><b>Part 2- Will span when they fly back out (About a week or 2 after part 1 ), learn the choreography and film the video</b></h2><h2><b>Part 3- Will be the grand finale when they perform it live at Dick clarks NYE </b></h2><p><b>PAIRINGS (JUST TO CLARIFY)</b></p><p><b>MIMI X J HOPE</b></p><p><b>JADEX X TAEHYUNG</b></p><p><b>CAITLYN X JIMIN</b></p><p><b>NICOLE X JUNGKOOK</b></p><p><b>BONUS- MIKI/NAMJOON (MORE SO IN PART 3 )&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><i>ALSO THE COLLAB IS ONLY DANCELINE (PRETTY SURE I HEARD TAE IS OFFICALLY IN DANCELINE NOW) THAT&rsquo;S WHY MINXS HAS 4 MEMBERS BUT THE REMIX IS BEING PRODUCED BY RM AND SUGA, JIN WILL MAKE A APPERENCE IN THE MV.&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b>But ALL parts will have smut moments, and again there will be moments with the other guys and clearly the girls I&rsquo;ve connected them too in this intro BUT the main focus IS MILA AND JHOPE moving forward.</b></p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<h2>&ldquo;EGOTISTIC&rdquo; BTS X GIRLGROUP MATURE AU ONE SHOT SNEAK PEEK (JHOPE FOCUS)</h2>\n<h2><b><i>&ldquo;EGOTISTIC &ldquo; BTS X GIRLGROUP MATURE AU PART 1 SNEAK PEEK</i></b></h2>\n<p><b><i>(Again all of the boys are in this and there will be some flirtation and slight smut referenced amongst all members but the main smut and dialog focus will be Jhope/Mila. This sneak peek is 2k, but it sets up the story even if you haven&rsquo;t read the backstory..which is kinda confusing I&rsquo;ll admit lol. So this gives you a clearer understanding also Jin is not in this part but he&rsquo;s in part 1 &nbsp;)</i></b></p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>P.S. -There is no smut in the sneak peek but there is in the full portion of part 1!</b></p>\n<p><i>Pulling up to the studio the car you guys arrived in was completely blacked out, it was around noon once you guys got there after dropping everything off at the hotel. You&rsquo;d be lying if you said you guys weren&rsquo;t exhausted though, it was a 14 hour flight non stop from New York which is where you guys were last for a show at Gramercy Theater. You all almost looking as if you coordinated to dress alike, all having on a variation of the same basic outfit which consisted of,high waisted leggings a cropped oversized hoodie/sweatshirt and short Bailey bow uggs, and huge sunglasses. BUT in your defense you did just do the Today show, a private MTV mini acoustic set, a concert and then hopped on a flight. Now just landing in Korea, doing a couple vocal warm ups on the way to the studio as the flight didn&rsquo;t do any of your voices justice. Shooting a quick text to RM letting him know you guys were pulling up as he was the main one you were all communicating with, it wasn&rsquo;t long before he was at the door, accompanied by Jhope. &nbsp;It appeared the door was key coded, so you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get in without them anyway.<b><br /></b></i></p>\n<p><i>They were both dressed pretty causal J opting for a black fitted jogger set, not sure at a quick glance the brand and a black baseball cap. All of the longer pieces of his dark locks were tucked in only leaving his sideburns. While a couple small diamonds danced along his ears .There was just something really sexy about seeing him in just chill, I guess almost boyfriend like outfits since in Kpop they are always dressed to the nines whenever they perform.Even though you really didn&rsquo;t know him, just from what you&rsquo;ve seen this was a good change of pace. RM&rsquo;s just keeping it simple in a pair of black jeans a gray sweater and a black beanie. Once you hopped out of the car, and the door to the building shut behind you, you were greeted with hugs. The two making their rounds to all of you, the conversation was pretty generic&rdquo; How are you, how was the flight?&rdquo; Blah blah blah .You noticed J almost purposely came to you last. His hands snaked around your waist, when he pulled you in, it lingered, a lot longer than it did with the other girls. It was clearly noticeable if anyone was paying attention but no one said anything . &ldquo;How are you feelin? How was your flight?&rdquo; Too arrogant to admit it but you actually loved the sound of his voice, by now all of the boys were about as fluent as RM in English. They&rsquo;ve also all improved honestly but they still held a slight accent when they spoke . Now that J was able to speak the language more fluently and more importantly he was COMFORTABLE &nbsp;his tone was able to readjust more to the base he held while speaking in his native tongue. </i></p>\n<p><i>His breath hit the side of your neck as you tried not to shiver while he pulled back from the hug &ldquo;I mean If I&rsquo;m being real with you, I&rsquo;m fucking beat right now. No joke..everyyyything hurts&hellip;.But I&rsquo;m grateful for what I do&hellip; and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way&hellip;&rdquo; You smiled back at him lazily as you tried to shake your jetlag. &nbsp;In which he returned with a nood his warm smile causing his eyes to crinkle as he rubbed your shoulder gently. A slight moan leaving your lips on accident, your muscles were so tense and his hands felt so good. He noticed the second his hand touched your skin what your issue was &ldquo;Shit your muscles are tight&rdquo; It hit the back of your neck in the form of a whisper initially as the grip on your shoulder tightened and you winced at the pressure &ldquo;You need to take better care of that, I know you no better&rdquo; His tone almost came out as if he was reprimanding you. Part of you thinking ..you got a lotta nerve&hellip;but you knew he was right. So instead You nodded letting out a slow exhale, he was right usually you would get a massage or sometimes you guys would massage each other you just didn&rsquo;t have time. You were all still in the entry way as Rm got distracted in random conversation with the girls, from what you could hear just filling him in on the crazy 48 hours you guys just had. Finally disconnecting from the conversation he lead you towards long hallway that led to the elevator. As you started to follow the group, &nbsp;you felt his &nbsp;hands gently reconnect to the pressure points in your back massaging the area gently as you walked over to the elevator. Faint moans left your lips as he eased your pain, they weren&rsquo;t filled with an ulterior motive you were just hurting in all honesty. But he&rsquo;d be lying if he said they weren&rsquo;t having an affect on him as he tried to muffle his own, loving the way your body reacted to him, even with just his innocent touch.You two never really talked, it was always brief always at a loud event but it wasn&rsquo;t a secret that his eye always caught your glance and vise versa.</i></p>\n</p>",
