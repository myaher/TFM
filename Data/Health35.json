The infection is mostly found in sub-tropical and tropical regions and is rarely reported in developed countries. In some of the developing countries, such as India, Papua New Guinea, and the Caribbean, the infection is regarded as an endemic ,  .</p><p>The bacterium Klebsiella granulomatis infects the skin around the genitals and causes ulcers which result in the destruction of the skin around the affected area.

It is mostly spread through the means of vaginal or anal intercourse and rare cases of infection through oral sex have been reported. However, anal intercourse is suspected to be the most frequent source of infection. About 50 per cent of the affected (men and women) have developed lesions in the anal region  .</p><p>Studies have revealed that men are most likely to be affected by the infection than women and commonly occurs in people aged between 20 to 40. Most of the cases of the STI reported are in people who have travelled to places that are at a high risk of the infection  . And, a very small proportion of people may be infected through direct, non-sexual contact (skin to skin).</p><h2>Symptoms Of Granuloma Inguinale</h2><p>The common signs indicating the development of the infection are small, painless nodules (pimple like) which develops into an open and fleshy lesion. The infection develops in the genital area and in some cases, mouth sores can also develop. This aggravates until the infected tissue gets mutilated and the infection will continue to latch onto other tissues  ,  .</p><p>Apart from this, the symptoms of the sexually transmitted disease can be described in line with the stages of Granuloma inguinale.</p><h2>Stages Of Granuloma Inguinale</h2><p>The signs of the infection develop at a slow pace.

The ulcers may have a foul smell and will be lined with granulated tissue.</li><li><strong>Stage three:</strong> Upon reaching the third stage, the infection will become deep and the ulcers will turn into morph tissue. </li></ul><h2>Causes Of Granuloma Inguinale</h2><p>The infection is caused by the Klebsiella granulomatis bacteria. One can contract the infection by having vaginal or anal intercourse with an infected partner. In very rare cases, it has spread through oral sex.

It is mostly spread through the means of vaginal or anal intercourse and rare cases of infection through oral sex have been reported.

About 50 per cent of the affected (men and women) have developed lesions in the anal region  .</p><p>Studies have revealed that men are most likely to be affected by the infection than women and commonly occurs in people aged between 20 to 40.

When you overwork the body (especially when coupled with under eating) your body tries hard to conserve precious energy (yes, in the form of calories) and will burn less and less at each workout. This will also overwork the adrenal glands. Adrenal fatigue (or worse, exhaustion) will make you age at a MUCH faster rate than otherwise, and prevent any sustainable weight loss along the way. The key is to build muscle first, then preserve that muscle while burning fat and keeping healthy as you go. This is the magic recipe for a long life and a fit body.
