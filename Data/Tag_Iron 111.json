While close with his mother Maria, his relationship with his father Howard was predominantly strained, a great deal of distance growing between the two as the years went by. But his world came crumbling down when his parents were involved in a car accident in December 1991, an incident which would later be discovered as a staged assassination by HYDRA at the hands of the Winter Soldier. Stark Industries was left in turmoil and Obadiah Stane was left to pick up the pieces. Though successful in the eyes of Forbes and Wall Street, the company fell under dark and uncertain times, even as \u201cthe prodigal son\u201d finally took an active interest and became CEO. Creating a series of industry defining designs, Tony\u2019s leadership saw the business\u2019s shares skyrocketing, their notoriety for being technological pioneers preceding them as they attained military funding to provide the US with weapons for use in hostile territories overseas.</small></p><p><small>During a demo of the billionaire\u2019s latest feat of engineering, the Jericho Missile, in Afghanistan, his privileged lifestyle fell under threat. Captured by the Ten Rings and wounded by shrapnel from his own weapon, the terrorist cell demanded he make a replica of the missile in order to ensure his freedom or die by their hand. Knowing his captors would never keep up their end of the bargain, Tony created an armored suit powered by an arc reactor with the help of Ho Yinsen. After three months of work, they enacted their escape plan. While Yinsen didn\u2019t survive, his message stayed with Tony: don\u2019t waste your life. Tony overhauled his business strategy - adopting more diverse directions in innovation, ceasing all development in weapons, and utilizing repulsor technology to bring about patented Clean Energy across the world.</small></p><p><small>Tony went on to become a founding member of the Avengers. The Chitauri Invasion that brought them together as a team, also left Tony deeply unsettled. The prospect of Earth being so vulnerable left him striving to protect it no matter how unorthodox his methods. The peace his efforts gained was short-lived, the Avengers\u2019 efforts to secure the cosmic safety of Earth from the threat of Thanos left them vulnerable for Skrulls to infiltrate. Veranke\u2019s forces replaced key figures in society with their own foot soldiers, including Steve Rogers. The Skrull who took his place, Pitt'o, was captured and interrogated by Bucky Barnes. When Tony covertly rendezvoused with the pair, Pitt'o activated a virus which affected the digital signature of the billionaire\u2019s arc reactor. The infiltration of the device left Tony increasingly sick and taken into the care of S.H.I.E.L.D. due to the virus\u2019 corruption spreading across the entirety of the Stark Network, affecting international communications and security. Unable to be at the forefront of the fight against the extraterrestrials, Stark helped behind the scenes, but the plight took a heavy impact on Stark Industries reputation and even moreso on Tony\u2019s sense of well-being.</small></p><p><small>With the Skrulls defeated, the Network was back online with advanced security measures in place. In a bid to rebuild its ranking in the world, Stark Industries announced the Starkdynamics event in Tokyo, an international think-tank comprising of a global consortium of brilliant people developing paradigm shifting concepts. While several companies showcased their work and research, Tony delivered a keynote speech announcing Project Epsilon, an effort that marked the procurement of Extremis, a carefully crafted virus which harnessed the bioelectrical potential to hack and upgrade the human repair center. Extremis offered the prospect of accelerated healing, boosted immune systems, and organ regeneration. Tony\u2019s personal goal for the project was to heal himself of the shrapnel injuries he had sustained in Afghanistan that made him dependent upon his arc reactor technology. Harry Osborn - in a similar vein - saw the potential for Extremis to cure his inherited, terminal disease. Osborn approached the Avenger with the offer of collaboration.

While close with his mother Maria, his relationship with his father Howard was predominantly strained, a great deal of distance growing between the two as the years went by. But his world came crumbling down when his parents were involved in a car accident in December 1991, an incident which would later be discovered as a staged assassination by HYDRA at the hands of the Winter Soldier. Stark Industries was left in turmoil and Obadiah Stane was left to pick up the pieces. Though successful in the eyes of Forbes and Wall Street, the company fell under dark and uncertain times, even as \u201cthe prodigal son\u201d finally took an active interest and became CEO. Creating a series of industry defining designs, Tony\u2019s leadership saw the business\u2019s shares skyrocketing, their notoriety for being technological pioneers preceding them as they attained military funding to provide the US with weapons for use in hostile territories overseas.</small></p><p><small>During a demo of the billionaire\u2019s latest feat of engineering, the Jericho Missile, in Afghanistan, his privileged lifestyle fell under threat. Captured by the Ten Rings and wounded by shrapnel from his own weapon, the terrorist cell demanded he make a replica of the missile in order to ensure his freedom or die by their hand. Knowing his captors would never keep up their end of the bargain, Tony created an armored suit powered by an arc reactor with the help of Ho Yinsen. After three months of work, they enacted their escape plan. While Yinsen didn\u2019t survive, his message stayed with Tony: don\u2019t waste your life. Tony overhauled his business strategy - adopting more diverse directions in innovation, ceasing all development in weapons, and utilizing repulsor technology to bring about patented Clean Energy across the world.</small></p><p><small>Tony went on to become a founding member of the Avengers. The Chitauri Invasion that brought them together as a team, also left Tony deeply unsettled. The prospect of Earth being so vulnerable left him striving to protect it no matter how unorthodox his methods. The peace his efforts gained was short-lived, the Avengers\u2019 efforts to secure the cosmic safety of Earth from the threat of Thanos left them vulnerable for Skrulls to infiltrate. Veranke\u2019s forces replaced key figures in society with their own foot soldiers, including Steve Rogers. The Skrull who took his place, Pitt'o, was captured and interrogated by Bucky Barnes. When Tony covertly rendezvoused with the pair, Pitt'o activated a virus which affected the digital signature of the billionaire\u2019s arc reactor. The infiltration of the device left Tony increasingly sick and taken into the care of S.H.I.E.L.D. due to the virus\u2019 corruption spreading across the entirety of the Stark Network, affecting international communications and security. Unable to be at the forefront of the fight against the extraterrestrials, Stark helped behind the scenes, but the plight took a heavy impact on Stark Industries reputation and even moreso on Tony\u2019s sense of well-being.</small></p><p><small>With the Skrulls defeated, the Network was back online with advanced security measures in place. In a bid to rebuild its ranking in the world, Stark Industries announced the Starkdynamics event in Tokyo, an international think-tank comprising of a global consortium of brilliant people developing paradigm shifting concepts. While several companies showcased their work and research, Tony delivered a keynote speech announcing Project Epsilon, an effort that marked the procurement of Extremis, a carefully crafted virus which harnessed the bioelectrical potential to hack and upgrade the human repair center. Extremis offered the prospect of accelerated healing, boosted immune systems, and organ regeneration. Tony\u2019s personal goal for the project was to heal himself of the shrapnel injuries he had sustained in Afghanistan that made him dependent upon his arc reactor technology. Harry Osborn - in a similar vein - saw the potential for Extremis to cure his inherited, terminal disease. Osborn approached the Avenger with the offer of collaboration.

During an attack at Avengers Mansion, the two clashed and Stark was left severely wounded, his arc reactor destroyed, and - if not for the assistance of Loki, who had his own grudges against the Goblin - left for dead.</small></p><p><small>Delivered to the Baxter Building and with Extremis administered, Tony learned the Goblin&rsquo;s true identity. The two enhanced corporate moguls battled it out over Manhattan, ending in a destructive stalemate over the East River, both participants plunging into the depths below as lower Manhattan was thrown into darkness at the hands of an explosive EMP burst set off by the Goblin in one final act of vengeance. The faithful A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., aided its creator at the conclusion of the dire situation, piloting the Iron Man suit to a safe location as New York City began to recover from the disastrous outcome of the brawl. The United Nations World Security Council resolved to take necessary action to counter the rising tide of an increasingly unaccountable enhanced vigilante community. With immense pressure placed upon S.H.I.E.L.D. to direct the momentum of such a measure, the Agreement Concerning Cooperation, Oversight and Registration of Discovered Superhumans (Accords) were soon subject to a first draft. Stark was the first Avenger to view it, and - in the aftermath of Extremis - became its first supporter based on his sheer guilt for the damage caused to the city, including of the death of one of S.H.I.E.L.D.&rsquo;s young pilots.</small></p><p><small>While the Avengers met amongst themselves to discuss their course of action only to find themselves on opposite sides of a fence, Tony became increasingly involved in the support of the Accords. Stark Industries provided stringent protocols required for the database of registrants and Tony became the public face of registration. During a gesture of good will, the World Security Council offered a ceremonial signing of the Accords on S.H.I.E.L.D.&lsquo;s Iliad Helicarrier to Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. With inside string-pulling from HYDRA, the public was led to believe that the bureaucratic olive branch spiraled into a terrorist attack as the Helicarrier crashed into Liberty Island. Both Barnes and Rogers were implicated in the attack and forced underground. The event was enough to sway public opinion and registration became mandatory for all enhanced individuals, the billionaire tasked with finding the pair.</small></p></blockquote><h2><b>&equiv; CURRENTLY</b></h2><blockquote><p><small>As events unfolded, it was found that individuals detained at the Hart Island Facility were subjected to less than humane conditions and Tony&rsquo;s opinion shifting to aid his fellow teammates during this desperate time. The Avengers disbanded shortly after the light shone on Hart Island unveiled its ugly truths. Tensions still strain high between the heroes as they aspire to return to their days of glory.</small></p></blockquote><h2><b>&equiv; NOTE</b></h2><blockquote><p><small>FightAsOne has Thor Odinson, Clint Barton, Carol Danvers, Bucky Barnes, and other various characters associated with Tony Stark.</small></p></blockquote><p><small>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&rarr; </small><a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/jointhegroup\"><small>HOW TO JOIN</small></a> <small>&rarr; <a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/faq\">FAQ </a>&rarr; <a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/rules\">RULES</a></small> <small>&rarr; </small><small><a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/mostwanted\">MOST WANTED</a></small></p></p>",
