Never was the Mighty Nein going to find help from a place that doesn&rsquo;t trust creatures that aren&rsquo;t humans, elves, or halflings (if you look at some of Nott&rsquo;s earliest views of the world and group you&rsquo;ll understand).</p><p>Never was the group going to find a haven with the place that did experiments on one of their members as a child, indoctrinated and magically manipulated said child, took that child and tortured him, and then ordered him to kill his expendable parents (who were on the very bottom of the social ladder). </p><p>And that&rsquo;s my beef.</p>",
