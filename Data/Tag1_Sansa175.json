Sister of the King was usually a princess, but she wasn&rsquo;t born one, it didn&rsquo;t sound right to her. Lady of Winterfell sounded better, especially from Jon&rsquo;s lips. At the table everybody cheered for them, they cheered for the white wolf and for the fair lady. But there was no King and Queen, and she knew a King always needs a Queen. If not to love, then to make babes, to have an heir and everything that had sounded so wonderful to her when she was a little girl. Today she isn&rsquo;t little girl anymore.</p><p>The sudden thought of Jon marrying some girl, making her his queen felt so strange and so wrong. A stranger would be standing where she stood. She would be the Lady of Winterfell, sure, maybe even have her seat at the table but it was her place next to Jon she would lose. At that thought, she felt tension and queasiness run over her. She had to shake herself and rub her face to think of something else, she was not supposed to feel like that. She took a deep breath and looked out of the window, snow was falling.</p><p>Then from afar steps approach, then a quick knock on the door. She opened the door, looking at her King, it was still Jon but this time she felt her chest flutter more than usual, was she anxious? Sansa gathered herself like a lady should and said quietly &ldquo;Your Grace&rdquo;. Jon looked away and mumbled, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to do that&rdquo;. Sansa was amused how easy it was to make him look all bothered, this time teasingly she said: &ldquo;Sorry, your highness, how would wish me to address you&rdquo;. &ldquo;Jon should be fine,&rdquo; he said, looking away, adding &ldquo;my Lady&rdquo; with a crooked smile when their eyes met again.</p><p>Father often called mother by her title, at least in public mostly so.

As children, they were not very close with Jon, at least not all the time and mother had made sure it stayed that way. Still, Jon was just Jon, and she was just Sansa, it had been the same when they met back at The Wall as no time had passed, but a lot had happened. Sansa knew Jon was only teasing, but it also brought her mind back to her previous thoughts.</p><p>When Jon entered the room and they seated themselves next to the fireplace like they had so many nights before in their tents and at the Wall, it almost felt the same. It had been only a few moons since they were reunited, but they had spent so many nights next to fire talking that it felt like the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Odd to sit here,&rdquo; Jon said.

They were mother and father&rsquo;s chambers, Sansa thought, never supposed to be hers. But life doesn&rsquo;t always go how it is supposed to.</p><p>One time she might have wished to get away from Winterfell, marry, be the Queen. Today looking out the small window she felt closer to being a Queen than she ever did in Kings Landing when she was betrothed to Joffrey. She felt that this castle was hers, the North was hers, hers to protect and lead against everything that lays to the South and to the North. It was her place, her people needed help to rebuild the damage, Jon needed her and she could actually do something of importance, not to be just a face in the court, not to play games with power-hungry two-faced southerners. She also liked the quiet, finally having a home again. The feeling of agency she had, after a long time being without any, was also a thing she began to&nbsp;appreciate.</p><p>Just a fortnight ago Jon was proclaimed King in the North, he&rsquo;d never wanted to be a king, but Sansa thought that he did truly look kingly that evening. Jon had accepted his new role reluctantly but graciously.</p><p>If Jon is the King what did it make her? Sister of the King was usually a princess, but she wasn&rsquo;t born one, it didn&rsquo;t sound right to her. Lady of Winterfell sounded better, especially from Jon&rsquo;s lips. At the table everybody cheered for them, they cheered for the white wolf and for the fair lady. But there was no King and Queen, and she knew a King always needs a Queen. If not to love, then to make babes, to have an heir and everything that had sounded so wonderful to her when she was a little girl. Today she isn&rsquo;t little girl anymore.</p><p>The sudden thought of Jon marrying some girl, making her his queen felt so strange and so wrong. A stranger would be standing where she stood. She would be the Lady of Winterfell, sure, maybe even have her seat at the table but it was her place next to Jon she would lose. At that thought, she felt tension and queasiness run over her. She had to shake herself and rub her face to think of something else, she was not supposed to feel like that. She took a deep breath and looked out of the window, snow was falling.</p><p>Then from afar steps approach, then a quick knock on the door. She opened the door, looking at her King, it was still Jon but this time she felt her chest flutter more than usual, was she anxious? Sansa gathered herself like a lady should and said quietly &ldquo;Your Grace&rdquo;. Jon looked away and mumbled, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to do that&rdquo;. Sansa was amused how easy it was to make him look all bothered, this time teasingly she said: &ldquo;Sorry, your highness, how would wish me to address you&rdquo;. &ldquo;Jon should be fine,&rdquo; he said, looking away, adding &ldquo;my Lady&rdquo; with a crooked smile when their eyes met again.</p><p>Father often called mother by her title, at least in public mostly so. That&rsquo;s how adults were addressed, she was an adult too she realized, when had that happened? She certainly was not a child anymore. As children, they were not very close with Jon, at least not all the time and mother had made sure it stayed that way. Still, Jon was just Jon, and she was just Sansa, it had been the same when they met back at The Wall as no time had passed, but a lot had happened. Sansa knew Jon was only teasing, but it also brought her mind back to her previous thoughts.</p><p>When Jon entered the room and they seated themselves next to the fireplace like they had so many nights before in their tents and at the Wall, it almost felt the same. It had been only a few moons since they were reunited, but they had spent so many nights next to fire talking that it felt like the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Odd to sit here,&rdquo; Jon said. He had never really been welcome here. Lady Catelyn never had any love for him as a child, and it only got worse as he grew older.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d never imagined..&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;Not the same of course, but I mean, still, never imagined&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo;</p><p>Jon poured them some wine he had brought and talked how he&rsquo;d been going around Winterfell and discussing repairs that needed to be done with builders. The Boltons had restored the castle somewhat, but much was still in ruins and unusable. Even through castle and lands around it were way more empty than it used to be when they were little, there were many people needed to be hosted, their men, free folk, Knights of the Vale and people daring to return to Winterfell again.</p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t stay in tents for long&rdquo; Jon said, &ldquo;Right now it might be fine like they say, but soon it will get really cold, then no fires will keep them warm there&rdquo;. &ldquo;The resources are scarce but Lord Royce offered generous help with everything, I can&rsquo;t help but feel like a beggar,&rdquo; he said and chuckled sadly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pay them back, we can trust Lord Yohn Royce, he&rsquo;s an honest man, that&rsquo;s what we need right now,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;Better them than someone else&rdquo; Jon agreed and Sansa nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;They are so generous that they even insist on setting a date for the repayment, other houses have offered their help too,&rdquo; Jon said, &ldquo;Lord Grafton offered to send his son accompanied by his youngest daughter to discuss the terms and said that he expects no repayment&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Sansa said, getting the idea what Lord Grafton had meant. &ldquo;Very generous of him&rdquo; she managed to add. Sansa took a sip of wine, then another. The situation felt so uncomfortable and the couldn&rsquo;t think of a way to change the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;It seems he&rsquo;s proposing a marriage,&rdquo; Jon said and didn&rsquo;t look at Sansa, took a breath and decided to fix his gaze at the ceiling. The moments seemed to go on forever for Sansa as her heartbeat became faster and she tried to think of what to say next, she was about to comment on how the wine tasted.</p><p>Before she could say anything Jon said &ldquo;I declined, I have no plan for marriage and no need for it&rdquo; and stared at Sansa&rsquo;s eyes. He looked deep into her eyes and for a moment Sansa felt a connection, ease coming over her and she knew he thought the same thoughts as her, they were on the same page and whatever happened she&rsquo;d never lose Jon really. He was looking straight through her and she didn&rsquo;t even try to put up a face. She smiled and so did he and everything was simple again.</p></p>",

        "body": "<p>Here is another chapter of my slowburn. Finally, Jon and Sansa are reunited, but politics get in the way and they have to discuss what to do about Jon\u2019s claim to the throne. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/40692992\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Jon was so\ntired, he thought he would fall asleep on his feet. Now that he had arrived,\nand they had somehow managed to beat the White Walkers at least for the moment,\nhis immediate fear was gone, but he felt dread creeping at his heart. Somehow,\nhe had managed to come in time to save Winterfell, but he did not want to meet\nSansa as a married woman, or rather he did not want to meet her husband. He\nthought of Arya\u2019s letter of Lord Royce\u2019s letter, of Sansa\u2019s letter.</p><!-- more --><p><i>I have no wish but to set eyes again on you\nbefore I die.</i> He\nwould see Sansa\u2019s face again, but would she be Littlefinger\u2019s wife? Or\nSweetrobin\u2019s? He had seen many knights of the Vale amongst the fighting and he feared\nwhat this might mean.</p><p>Arya began\nto push Bran\u2019s chair determinedly and they made their way to the castle.</p><p>Sansa met\nthem half-way and began to run, when she saw Jon. Seeing her lifted Jon\u2019s heart\nand his tiredness fell from him. <i>It does\nnot matter, she is alive, I can see her. I can love her, even if she is married\nto another, I don\u2019t have to feel guilt over my love. At least we have that.</i></p><p>He wanted\nto hug her forever, to breathe in her smell, but the many eyes watching them\nmade him cautious. Sansa had had a tough time, he could see. Somebody had\ninjured her at her throat and Jon wanted to kill the person who had dared to\nmar her skin. She looked tired as well. </p><p>Sansa\nlaughed. \u201cYou\u2019re alive! You\u2019ve come back to us!\u201d Her laughter was infectious,\nand Jon found himself laughing as well.</p><p>\u201cI\nunderstand you know Olyvar?\u201d, Jon asked. \u201cHe has been a great help.\u201d</p><p>Olyvar had\nbeen with him, carrying that bloody banner all the time. The cloth hang limp now.</p><p>\u201cI see,\nyour path has brought you back to Winterfell! Welcome back!\u201d Sansa said.\n\u201cHoster will be very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Olyvar\nbowed. He looked as if he would fall on his back any moment, but he clutched\nthe staff of the banner. </p><p>\u201cWhat is on\nthat banner?\u201d Arya asked curiously. Olyvar eyed her warily, but Jon had to\nlaugh. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t\ndecided yet. If you ask Jaime Lannister it should be green dragon with grey\nwolf in his mouth or vice versa. I can\u2019t remember. He kept giving me\nsuggestions on our way north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaime\nLannister?\u201d, Sansa asked. \u201cSo, you did have a meeting with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a\nlong story. I don\u2019t even know, where to start. I\u2019ll tell you later in detail. Jaime\nLannister and the troops from the Riverlands are on their way to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the\nparley was a success?\u201d</p><p>Jon\ngrimaced. \u201cIt depends, what you would define as success.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nshrugged. \u201cYou brought a dragon and saved us, and another army is on its way.\nI\u2019d call this a success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long\nuntil they arrive here?\u201d, Sansa asked.</p><p>\u201cIt will be\nseveral weeks. Brienne promised they would march as fast as they can, but such\na large army will take some time to get here in the mid of winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will\nlikely be on time\u201d, Bran said. \u201cBrienne will drive them relentlessly.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nat Bran, curious. His cousin had grown, he looked like a young man, far too\nserious for his age though.</p><p>\u201cWe have to\ninform the council on everything and we have to plan. We do have another\nproblem after all.\u201d Bran insisted. He looked at Jon. \u201cYou did after all claim\nthe Iron Throne.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s good\nmood left him. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we get some sleep first? I\u2019m glad to see\nyou all, but I don\u2019t feel up to spar words with Littlefinger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittlefinger?\u201d Arya asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Littlefinger, I was informed by Lord\nRoyce that I might have to welcome him into the family, or is he already your\nhusband?\u201d. The anguish Jon had felt over Royce\u2019s letter got hold of him again.\nA cold hand clutched at his heart.</p><p>\u201cLittlefinger is dead,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cArya and I\nunmasked his treachery, he got a trial and was sentenced to death.\u201d She touched\nher throat.</p><p><i>He! He hurt her! Dead?\nHe is dead?</i></p><p>It took Jon a moment to understand this. He\nturned to Sansa. \u201cYou\u2019re not married to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, whatever made you think Sansa would marry\na douche like Littlefinger?\u201d That was Arya.</p><p>Jon was confused. \u201cYou did. You wrote about\nmarriage plans and Lord Royce also wrote to me about marriage plans. Are you\ntelling me there was no marriage? Not to Littlefinger? Not to Sweetrobin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you got that letter? I am so sorry, I\nmisunderstood everything.\u201d Arya became as red as a beet root. She grimaced. \u201cI\nalmost didn\u2019t realise that Littlefinger was playing a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, there was no marriage?\u201d Jon\u2019s voice\nsounded strange in his ears.</p><p>\u201cYou thought, I was married?\u201d, Sansa asked. Her\ncheeks were red. Jon thought about Sansa whispering into Ghost\u2019s ears and felt\nthe blood rush to his own face. He nodded silently while looking into Sansa\u2019s\neyes. <i>I have no wish but to set eyes on\nyou again before I die.</i> He could hardly believe, that he had managed to\narrive in time. His heart beat fast.</p><p>\u201cWe should convene and get everyone informed.\u201d\nBran interrupted them.</p><p>Jon spent the next hour in a daze. He could\nhardly believe anything his cousins told him. Bran a seer, and strong in magic,\nas he himself had witnessed, and his little sister, <i>no cousin</i>, a spy, decoding Littlefinger\u2019s secret diary with Sansa. Littlefinger\nas the instigator to Robert\u2019s rebellion. </p><p>There was something else Arya kept silent\nabout. He could see it it, not in her eyes that gave nothing away, but in Sansa\u2019s.\nSansa knew but obviously did not think this was for the whole council to know. He\nwatched Sansa while she told how they had tricked Littlefinger and how she had\nalmost been killed if it had not been for Ghost. He felt like his eyes were glued\nto her lips and he barely registered, when it was his time to tell what had\nhappened to him. He told almost everything, only leaving out his one night\ntryst with queen Daenerys. He felt that in light of his newfound parentage it\nwould not do any good. Also, he felt embarrassed about his desperation when he\nhad learned about a marriage alliance that didn\u2019t even happen. </p><p>It made explaining how exactly Daenerys had managed\nto read the letters meant for him a difficult task, but fortunately Arya was\nself-conscious about her letter as was Lord Royce who kept apologizing for his\nmistake, until Sansa told him, that he could not possibly have known, that she\nand Arya were hard on Littlefinger\u2019s trail.</p><p>\u201cDaenerys insisted that I bend the knee and let\nher decide on every Stark marriage. And she wanted me to deliver Brienne of\nTarth to her as a dragonslayer. I could not do that and was already inclined to\nclaim the throne, albeit reluctantly, when I got the news that Winterfell was\nunder siege.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Sansa. <i>I have no wish but to set eyes again on you before I die.</i> </p><p>\u201cI claimed the dragon, with help from Bran,\u201d he\nlooked at his cousin questioningly, and Bran nodded. \u201cI flew to the Riverlands\nand dropped off Ser Jaime, Brienne and Davos with the army there. I publically\nmade a bid for the Iron Throne and took the name Aegon that was given to me at\nmy birth. The Riverlands army will come to Winterfell as will the wildfire Ser\nDavos smuggled from King\u2019s Landing. The wildfire is on its way here as well. I\nentrusted it to the hands of Samwell Tarly, a brother of the Night\u2019s watch, and\nGendry, a natural son of Robert Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry!\u201d, Arya jumped up. \u201cYou saw Gendry.\u201d</p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t help himself. He grinned. \u201cHe\nremembered you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe better does!\u201d Arya exclaimed. \u201cI was so\nworried he died at the hand of that witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to see you safe and sound as\nwell, if I understood him correctly.\u201d Jon raised his hand. \u201cThat can be talked\nabout later. For now, I felt that I needed to explain myself to you all. I am\nvery sorry, that I could not take any council but that of Ser Davos, when I had\nto decide what to do with the knowledge about my parents. I decided to not trust\nDaenerys further when she turned on the promise she had given. And I decided to\nuse my claim. But that has set me against her, I fear. She will not like that I\nstole Rhaegal nor will she easily let go of her own claim.\u201d <i>My dear aunt.</i> A part of him regretted\nthat circumstances had set them up on opposite sides, but he had seen no other\nsolution and still did not see any.</p><p>Jon sighed deeply. \u201cI am nothing but a guest\nhere at Winterfell. I have no claim to the allegiance of the North, which is an\nindependent kingdom, but I will fight for the North, if you will have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can hardly complain, when you came here on\ntime on a dragon to save us.\u201d Lord Royce said. \u201cWe fought bravely, but we would\nhave been overwhelmed by now. And you brought armies, dragonglass and wildfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran should be King in the North,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>But Bran shook his head. \u201cI am the Three-eyed\nRaven. I have power enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Sansa should be Queen.\u201d </p><p>Jon looked at her. She would make a marvellous queen.\nSuddenly he wondered if he could try to woo her, woo her for real. He had been\nso relieved that she was not married to Littlefinger. But his mind only made\nthe connection now. He was not only free to love her, he was free to woo her.</p><p>But would a marriage alliance with a self-proclaimed\nking be to her advantage at all? Would it make sense for him as a pretender to\nally himself with her? The prospect to marry Sansa had him so excited that he\ndid not know if it would make political sense. It was as if his mind was so set\non marrying Sansa that he did not know, if it would be a good idea in the current\ncircumstance. He was pondering whether he should even bring this up. Or would\nthey all laugh in his face? Laugh that a Targaryen pretender would be so arrogant\nas to dare reach for a daughter of house Stark? Or be afraid that Rhaegar\u2019s son\nwould steal Lyanna\u2019s niece?</p><p>His mind was reeling at the possibilities and\nat first, he did not realise that Lord Royce was talking again.</p><p>\u201c\u2026. considering the last time, I proposed a\nmarriage, I hardly dare to speak again, but I think there is a solution for\nthis tricky question.\u201d</p><p><i>He can\u2019t mean what I\nthink he means. </i>Jon\nstole another look at Sansa. Her cheeks were red. <i>Does she think the same?</i></p><p>\u201cLady Sansa should not marry her cousin Sweetrobin,\nbut her other cousin, Aegon. We would position ourselves firmly at his side,\nbut considering that he chose to stake his claim only to come to our aid, that\nseems only fair. The North would have a strong standing in the seven kingdoms,\nstronger than ever before and if the King and the Queen have children, the\nThrone and Winterfell could go to different children, thus securing the independence\nof the North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want Sansa to marry Jon?\u201d Arya exclaimed.\nShe had jumped up again.</p><p>\u201cIt is what makes the most sense. He could\nprove to everybody, that he values the North. They could rule together, and Stark\nand Targaryen can stand against the threat from the North. And the Riverlands.\nAnd the Vale would stand with Lady Sansa as we stood in the Battle of the\nBastards.\u201d</p><p>Jon saw that Sansa\u2019s cheeks were still dark\nwith colour, but she stayed silent and looked in her lap. She had opened her\nmouth just a tiny bit, and Jon felt as if he could see her breath smoothing the\ndelicate flesh of her slightly parted lips. </p><p>Arya snorted. \u201cThat is a crackbrained idea.\u201d Her\neyes searched the table, but the Northern Lords were nodding in approval to\nLord Royce. Bran also nodded shortly.</p><p>Arya looked at Sansa, her head bent to the\nside. She sat again. \u201cWell, Jon would certainly treat you well, there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa still didn\u2019t say anything. To Jon she\nlooked afraid, flustered. And then he understood. <i>She doesn\u2019t know I love her. She feels this is just about her claim,\njust like the other times.</i></p><p>He stood up. <i>Oh Gods, let me do this right!</i></p><p>\u201cMy lords, I might not be your king any longer,\nbut while I was king, it was decided by this council that women in the North\nshould decide themselves on their marriages. I am sure, Lady Sansa is grateful\nfor your council, but she is the one who has to decide.\u201d</p><p>Sansa raised her gaze to his eyes, a flicker of\nhope in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, would you do me the honour of lending\nme your ears for a private and urgent conversation?\u201d</p><p>He stretched out his hand. Sansa stood as well,\nher eyes still locked to his and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy lords,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems Aegon Targaryen\nwants to discuss a matter of state. I ask for your leave and want to adjourn this\ncouncil until I will have decided in this matter.\u201d</p>",

At least we have that.</i></p><p>He wanted\nto hug her forever, to breathe in her smell, but the many eyes watching them\nmade him cautious. Sansa had had a tough time, he could see. Somebody had\ninjured her at her throat and Jon wanted to kill the person who had dared to\nmar her skin. She looked tired as well. </p><p>Sansa\nlaughed. \u201cYou\u2019re alive! You\u2019ve come back to us!\u201d Her laughter was infectious,\nand Jon found himself laughing as well.</p><p>\u201cI\nunderstand you know Olyvar?\u201d, Jon asked. \u201cHe has been a great help.\u201d</p><p>Olyvar had\nbeen with him, carrying that bloody banner all the time. The cloth hang limp now.</p><p>\u201cI see,\nyour path has brought you back to Winterfell! Welcome back!\u201d Sansa said.\n\u201cHoster will be very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Olyvar\nbowed. He looked as if he would fall on his back any moment, but he clutched\nthe staff of the banner. </p><p>\u201cWhat is on\nthat banner?\u201d Arya asked curiously. Olyvar eyed her warily, but Jon had to\nlaugh. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t\ndecided yet. If you ask Jaime Lannister it should be green dragon with grey\nwolf in his mouth or vice versa. I can\u2019t remember. He kept giving me\nsuggestions on our way north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaime\nLannister?\u201d, Sansa asked. \u201cSo, you did have a meeting with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a\nlong story. I don\u2019t even know, where to start. I\u2019ll tell you later in detail. Jaime\nLannister and the troops from the Riverlands are on their way to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the\nparley was a success?\u201d</p><p>Jon\ngrimaced. \u201cIt depends, what you would define as success.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nshrugged. \u201cYou brought a dragon and saved us, and another army is on its way.\nI\u2019d call this a success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long\nuntil they arrive here?\u201d, Sansa asked.</p><p>\u201cIt will be\nseveral weeks. Brienne promised they would march as fast as they can, but such\na large army will take some time to get here in the mid of winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will\nlikely be on time\u201d, Bran said. \u201cBrienne will drive them relentlessly.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nat Bran, curious. His cousin had grown, he looked like a young man, far too\nserious for his age though.</p><p>\u201cWe have to\ninform the council on everything and we have to plan. We do have another\nproblem after all.\u201d Bran insisted. He looked at Jon. \u201cYou did after all claim\nthe Iron Throne.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s good\nmood left him. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we get some sleep first? I\u2019m glad to see\nyou all, but I don\u2019t feel up to spar words with Littlefinger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittlefinger?\u201d Arya asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Littlefinger, I was informed by Lord\nRoyce that I might have to welcome him into the family, or is he already your\nhusband?\u201d. The anguish Jon had felt over Royce\u2019s letter got hold of him again.\nA cold hand clutched at his heart.</p><p>\u201cLittlefinger is dead,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cArya and I\nunmasked his treachery, he got a trial and was sentenced to death.\u201d She touched\nher throat.</p><p><i>He! He hurt her! Dead?\nHe is dead?</i></p><p>It took Jon a moment to understand this. He\nturned to Sansa. \u201cYou\u2019re not married to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, whatever made you think Sansa would marry\na douche like Littlefinger?\u201d That was Arya.</p><p>Jon was confused. \u201cYou did. You wrote about\nmarriage plans and Lord Royce also wrote to me about marriage plans. Are you\ntelling me there was no marriage? Not to Littlefinger? Not to Sweetrobin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you got that letter? I am so sorry, I\nmisunderstood everything.\u201d Arya became as red as a beet root. She grimaced. \u201cI\nalmost didn\u2019t realise that Littlefinger was playing a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, there was no marriage?\u201d Jon\u2019s voice\nsounded strange in his ears.</p><p>\u201cYou thought, I was married?\u201d, Sansa asked. Her\ncheeks were red. Jon thought about Sansa whispering into Ghost\u2019s ears and felt\nthe blood rush to his own face. He nodded silently while looking into Sansa\u2019s\neyes. <i>I have no wish but to set eyes on\nyou again before I die.</i> He could hardly believe, that he had managed to\narrive in time. His heart beat fast.</p><p>\u201cWe should convene and get everyone informed.\u201d\nBran interrupted them.</p><p>Jon spent the next hour in a daze. He could\nhardly believe anything his cousins told him. Bran a seer, and strong in magic,\nas he himself had witnessed, and his little sister, <i>no cousin</i>, a spy, decoding Littlefinger\u2019s secret diary with Sansa. Littlefinger\nas the instigator to Robert\u2019s rebellion. </p><p>There was something else Arya kept silent\nabout. He could see it it, not in her eyes that gave nothing away, but in Sansa\u2019s.\nSansa knew but obviously did not think this was for the whole council to know. He\nwatched Sansa while she told how they had tricked Littlefinger and how she had\nalmost been killed if it had not been for Ghost. He felt like his eyes were glued\nto her lips and he barely registered, when it was his time to tell what had\nhappened to him. He told almost everything, only leaving out his one night\ntryst with queen Daenerys. He felt that in light of his newfound parentage it\nwould not do any good. Also, he felt embarrassed about his desperation when he\nhad learned about a marriage alliance that didn\u2019t even happen. </p><p>It made explaining how exactly Daenerys had managed\nto read the letters meant for him a difficult task, but fortunately Arya was\nself-conscious about her letter as was Lord Royce who kept apologizing for his\nmistake, until Sansa told him, that he could not possibly have known, that she\nand Arya were hard on Littlefinger\u2019s trail.</p><p>\u201cDaenerys insisted that I bend the knee and let\nher decide on every Stark marriage. And she wanted me to deliver Brienne of\nTarth to her as a dragonslayer. I could not do that and was already inclined to\nclaim the throne, albeit reluctantly, when I got the news that Winterfell was\nunder siege.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Sansa. <i>I have no wish but to set eyes again on you before I die.</i> </p><p>\u201cI claimed the dragon, with help from Bran,\u201d he\nlooked at his cousin questioningly, and Bran nodded. \u201cI flew to the Riverlands\nand dropped off Ser Jaime, Brienne and Davos with the army there. I publically\nmade a bid for the Iron Throne and took the name Aegon that was given to me at\nmy birth. The Riverlands army will come to Winterfell as will the wildfire Ser\nDavos smuggled from King\u2019s Landing. The wildfire is on its way here as well. I\nentrusted it to the hands of Samwell Tarly, a brother of the Night\u2019s watch, and\nGendry, a natural son of Robert Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry!\u201d, Arya jumped up. \u201cYou saw Gendry.\u201d</p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t help himself. He grinned. \u201cHe\nremembered you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe better does!\u201d Arya exclaimed. \u201cI was so\nworried he died at the hand of that witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to see you safe and sound as\nwell, if I understood him correctly.\u201d Jon raised his hand. \u201cThat can be talked\nabout later. For now, I felt that I needed to explain myself to you all. I am\nvery sorry, that I could not take any council but that of Ser Davos, when I had\nto decide what to do with the knowledge about my parents. I decided to not trust\nDaenerys further when she turned on the promise she had given. And I decided to\nuse my claim. But that has set me against her, I fear. She will not like that I\nstole Rhaegal nor will she easily let go of her own claim.\u201d <i>My dear aunt.</i> A part of him regretted\nthat circumstances had set them up on opposite sides, but he had seen no other\nsolution and still did not see any.</p><p>Jon sighed deeply. \u201cI am nothing but a guest\nhere at Winterfell. I have no claim to the allegiance of the North, which is an\nindependent kingdom, but I will fight for the North, if you will have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can hardly complain, when you came here on\ntime on a dragon to save us.\u201d Lord Royce said. \u201cWe fought bravely, but we would\nhave been overwhelmed by now. And you brought armies, dragonglass and wildfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran should be King in the North,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>But Bran shook his head. \u201cI am the Three-eyed\nRaven.

At least we have that.</i></p><p>He wanted\nto hug her forever, to breathe in her smell, but the many eyes watching them\nmade him cautious. Sansa had had a tough time, he could see. Somebody had\ninjured her at her throat and Jon wanted to kill the person who had dared to\nmar her skin. She looked tired as well. </p><p>Sansa\nlaughed. \u201cYou\u2019re alive! You\u2019ve come back to us!\u201d Her laughter was infectious,\nand Jon found himself laughing as well.</p><p>\u201cI\nunderstand you know Olyvar?\u201d, Jon asked. \u201cHe has been a great help.\u201d</p><p>Olyvar had\nbeen with him, carrying that bloody banner all the time. The cloth hang limp now.</p><p>\u201cI see,\nyour path has brought you back to Winterfell! Welcome back!\u201d Sansa said.\n\u201cHoster will be very happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Olyvar\nbowed. He looked as if he would fall on his back any moment, but he clutched\nthe staff of the banner. </p><p>\u201cWhat is on\nthat banner?\u201d Arya asked curiously. Olyvar eyed her warily, but Jon had to\nlaugh. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t\ndecided yet. If you ask Jaime Lannister it should be green dragon with grey\nwolf in his mouth or vice versa. I can\u2019t remember. He kept giving me\nsuggestions on our way north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaime\nLannister?\u201d, Sansa asked. \u201cSo, you did have a meeting with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a\nlong story. I don\u2019t even know, where to start. I\u2019ll tell you later in detail. Jaime\nLannister and the troops from the Riverlands are on their way to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the\nparley was a success?\u201d</p><p>Jon\ngrimaced. \u201cIt depends, what you would define as success.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nshrugged. \u201cYou brought a dragon and saved us, and another army is on its way.\nI\u2019d call this a success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long\nuntil they arrive here?\u201d, Sansa asked.</p><p>\u201cIt will be\nseveral weeks. Brienne promised they would march as fast as they can, but such\na large army will take some time to get here in the mid of winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will\nlikely be on time\u201d, Bran said. \u201cBrienne will drive them relentlessly.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked\nat Bran, curious. His cousin had grown, he looked like a young man, far too\nserious for his age though.</p><p>\u201cWe have to\ninform the council on everything and we have to plan. We do have another\nproblem after all.\u201d Bran insisted. He looked at Jon. \u201cYou did after all claim\nthe Iron Throne.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s good\nmood left him. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we get some sleep first? I\u2019m glad to see\nyou all, but I don\u2019t feel up to spar words with Littlefinger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittlefinger?\u201d Arya asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Littlefinger, I was informed by Lord\nRoyce that I might have to welcome him into the family, or is he already your\nhusband?\u201d. The anguish Jon had felt over Royce\u2019s letter got hold of him again.\nA cold hand clutched at his heart.</p><p>\u201cLittlefinger is dead,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cArya and I\nunmasked his treachery, he got a trial and was sentenced to death.\u201d She touched\nher throat.</p><p><i>He! He hurt her! Dead?\nHe is dead?</i></p><p>It took Jon a moment to understand this. He\nturned to Sansa. \u201cYou\u2019re not married to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, whatever made you think Sansa would marry\na douche like Littlefinger?\u201d That was Arya.</p><p>Jon was confused. \u201cYou did. You wrote about\nmarriage plans and Lord Royce also wrote to me about marriage plans. Are you\ntelling me there was no marriage? Not to Littlefinger? Not to Sweetrobin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you got that letter? I am so sorry, I\nmisunderstood everything.\u201d Arya became as red as a beet root. She grimaced. \u201cI\nalmost didn\u2019t realise that Littlefinger was playing a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, there was no marriage?\u201d Jon\u2019s voice\nsounded strange in his ears.</p><p>\u201cYou thought, I was married?\u201d, Sansa asked. Her\ncheeks were red. Jon thought about Sansa whispering into Ghost\u2019s ears and felt\nthe blood rush to his own face. He nodded silently while looking into Sansa\u2019s\neyes. <i>I have no wish but to set eyes on\nyou again before I die.</i> He could hardly believe, that he had managed to\narrive in time. His heart beat fast.</p><p>\u201cWe should convene and get everyone informed.\u201d\nBran interrupted them.</p><p>Jon spent the next hour in a daze. He could\nhardly believe anything his cousins told him. Bran a seer, and strong in magic,\nas he himself had witnessed, and his little sister, <i>no cousin</i>, a spy, decoding Littlefinger\u2019s secret diary with Sansa. Littlefinger\nas the instigator to Robert\u2019s rebellion. </p><p>There was something else Arya kept silent\nabout. He could see it it, not in her eyes that gave nothing away, but in Sansa\u2019s.\nSansa knew but obviously did not think this was for the whole council to know. He\nwatched Sansa while she told how they had tricked Littlefinger and how she had\nalmost been killed if it had not been for Ghost. He felt like his eyes were glued\nto her lips and he barely registered, when it was his time to tell what had\nhappened to him. He told almost everything, only leaving out his one night\ntryst with queen Daenerys. He felt that in light of his newfound parentage it\nwould not do any good. Also, he felt embarrassed about his desperation when he\nhad learned about a marriage alliance that didn\u2019t even happen. </p><p>It made explaining how exactly Daenerys had managed\nto read the letters meant for him a difficult task, but fortunately Arya was\nself-conscious about her letter as was Lord Royce who kept apologizing for his\nmistake, until Sansa told him, that he could not possibly have known, that she\nand Arya were hard on Littlefinger\u2019s trail.</p><p>\u201cDaenerys insisted that I bend the knee and let\nher decide on every Stark marriage. And she wanted me to deliver Brienne of\nTarth to her as a dragonslayer. I could not do that and was already inclined to\nclaim the throne, albeit reluctantly, when I got the news that Winterfell was\nunder siege.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Sansa. <i>I have no wish but to set eyes again on you before I die.</i> </p><p>\u201cI claimed the dragon, with help from Bran,\u201d he\nlooked at his cousin questioningly, and Bran nodded. \u201cI flew to the Riverlands\nand dropped off Ser Jaime, Brienne and Davos with the army there. I publically\nmade a bid for the Iron Throne and took the name Aegon that was given to me at\nmy birth. The Riverlands army will come to Winterfell as will the wildfire Ser\nDavos smuggled from King\u2019s Landing. The wildfire is on its way here as well. I\nentrusted it to the hands of Samwell Tarly, a brother of the Night\u2019s watch, and\nGendry, a natural son of Robert Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGendry!\u201d, Arya jumped up. \u201cYou saw Gendry.\u201d</p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t help himself. He grinned. \u201cHe\nremembered you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe better does!\u201d Arya exclaimed. \u201cI was so\nworried he died at the hand of that witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to see you safe and sound as\nwell, if I understood him correctly.\u201d Jon raised his hand. \u201cThat can be talked\nabout later. For now, I felt that I needed to explain myself to you all. I am\nvery sorry, that I could not take any council but that of Ser Davos, when I had\nto decide what to do with the knowledge about my parents. I decided to not trust\nDaenerys further when she turned on the promise she had given. And I decided to\nuse my claim. But that has set me against her, I fear. She will not like that I\nstole Rhaegal nor will she easily let go of her own claim.\u201d <i>My dear aunt.</i> A part of him regretted\nthat circumstances had set them up on opposite sides, but he had seen no other\nsolution and still did not see any.</p><p>Jon sighed deeply. \u201cI am nothing but a guest\nhere at Winterfell. I have no claim to the allegiance of the North, which is an\nindependent kingdom, but I will fight for the North, if you will have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can hardly complain, when you came here on\ntime on a dragon to save us.\u201d Lord Royce said. \u201cWe fought bravely, but we would\nhave been overwhelmed by now. And you brought armies, dragonglass and wildfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBran should be King in the North,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>But Bran shook his head. \u201cI am the Three-eyed\nRaven. I have power enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Sansa should be Queen.\u201d </p><p>Jon looked at her. She would make a marvellous queen.\nSuddenly he wondered if he could try to woo her, woo her for real. He had been\nso relieved that she was not married to Littlefinger. But his mind only made\nthe connection now. He was not only free to love her, he was free to woo her.</p><p>But would a marriage alliance with a self-proclaimed\nking be to her advantage at all? Would it make sense for him as a pretender to\nally himself with her? The prospect to marry Sansa had him so excited that he\ndid not know if it would make political sense. It was as if his mind was so set\non marrying Sansa that he did not know, if it would be a good idea in the current\ncircumstance. He was pondering whether he should even bring this up. Or would\nthey all laugh in his face? Laugh that a Targaryen pretender would be so arrogant\nas to dare reach for a daughter of house Stark? Or be afraid that Rhaegar\u2019s son\nwould steal Lyanna\u2019s niece?</p><p>His mind was reeling at the possibilities and\nat first, he did not realise that Lord Royce was talking again.</p><p>\u201c\u2026. considering the last time, I proposed a\nmarriage, I hardly dare to speak again, but I think there is a solution for\nthis tricky question.\u201d</p><p><i>He can\u2019t mean what I\nthink he means. </i>Jon\nstole another look at Sansa. Her cheeks were red. <i>Does she think the same?</i></p><p>\u201cLady Sansa should not marry her cousin Sweetrobin,\nbut her other cousin, Aegon. We would position ourselves firmly at his side,\nbut considering that he chose to stake his claim only to come to our aid, that\nseems only fair. The North would have a strong standing in the seven kingdoms,\nstronger than ever before and if the King and the Queen have children, the\nThrone and Winterfell could go to different children, thus securing the independence\nof the North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want Sansa to marry Jon?\u201d Arya exclaimed.\nShe had jumped up again.</p><p>\u201cIt is what makes the most sense. He could\nprove to everybody, that he values the North. They could rule together, and Stark\nand Targaryen can stand against the threat from the North. And the Riverlands.\nAnd the Vale would stand with Lady Sansa as we stood in the Battle of the\nBastards.\u201d</p><p>Jon saw that Sansa\u2019s cheeks were still dark\nwith colour, but she stayed silent and looked in her lap. She had opened her\nmouth just a tiny bit, and Jon felt as if he could see her breath smoothing the\ndelicate flesh of her slightly parted lips. </p><p>Arya snorted. \u201cThat is a crackbrained idea.\u201d Her\neyes searched the table, but the Northern Lords were nodding in approval to\nLord Royce. Bran also nodded shortly.</p><p>Arya looked at Sansa, her head bent to the\nside. She sat again. \u201cWell, Jon would certainly treat you well, there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa still didn\u2019t say anything. To Jon she\nlooked afraid, flustered. And then he understood. <i>She doesn\u2019t know I love her. She feels this is just about her claim,\njust like the other times.</i></p><p>He stood up. <i>Oh Gods, let me do this right!</i></p><p>\u201cMy lords, I might not be your king any longer,\nbut while I was king, it was decided by this council that women in the North\nshould decide themselves on their marriages. I am sure, Lady Sansa is grateful\nfor your council, but she is the one who has to decide.\u201d</p><p>Sansa raised her gaze to his eyes, a flicker of\nhope in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, would you do me the honour of lending\nme your ears for a private and urgent conversation?\u201d</p><p>He stretched out his hand. Sansa stood as well,\nher eyes still locked to his and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy lords,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems Aegon Targaryen\nwants to discuss a matter of state. I ask for your leave and want to adjourn this\ncouncil until I will have decided in this matter.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>Here is another chapter of my slowburn. Finally, Jon and Sansa are reunited, but politics get in the way and they have to discuss what to do about Jon&rsquo;s claim to the throne. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/40692992\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Jon was so\ntired, he thought he would fall asleep on his feet. Now that he had arrived,\nand they had somehow managed to beat the White Walkers at least for the moment,\nhis immediate fear was gone, but he felt dread creeping at his heart. Somehow,\nhe had managed to come in time to save Winterfell, but he did not want to meet\nSansa as a married woman, or rather he did not want to meet her husband. He\nthought of Arya&rsquo;s letter of Lord Royce&rsquo;s letter, of Sansa&rsquo;s letter.</p><p><i>I have no wish but to set eyes again on you\nbefore I die.</i> He\nwould see Sansa&rsquo;s face again, but would she be Littlefinger&rsquo;s wife? Or\nSweetrobin&rsquo;s? He had seen many knights of the Vale amongst the fighting and he feared\nwhat this might mean.</p><p>Arya began\nto push Bran&rsquo;s chair determinedly and they made their way to the castle.</p><p>Sansa met\nthem half-way and began to run, when she saw Jon. Seeing her lifted Jon&rsquo;s heart\nand his tiredness fell from him. <i>It does\nnot matter, she is alive, I can see her. I can love her, even if she is married\nto another, I don&rsquo;t have to feel guilt over my love. At least we have that.</i></p><p>He wanted\nto hug her forever, to breathe in her smell, but the many eyes watching them\nmade him cautious. Sansa had had a tough time, he could see. Somebody had\ninjured her at her throat and Jon wanted to kill the person who had dared to\nmar her skin. She looked tired as well. </p><p>Sansa\nlaughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive! You&rsquo;ve come back to us!&rdquo; Her laughter was infectious,\nand Jon found himself laughing as well.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nunderstand you know Olyvar?&rdquo;, Jon asked. &ldquo;He has been a great help.&rdquo;</p><p>Olyvar had\nbeen with him, carrying that bloody banner all the time. The cloth hang limp now.</p><p>&ldquo;I see,\nyour path has brought you back to Winterfell! Welcome back!&rdquo; Sansa said.\n&ldquo;Hoster will be very happy to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>Olyvar\nbowed.

Now that he had arrived,\nand they had somehow managed to beat the White Walkers at least for the moment,\nhis immediate fear was gone, but he felt dread creeping at his heart. Somehow,\nhe had managed to come in time to save Winterfell, but he did not want to meet\nSansa as a married woman, or rather he did not want to meet her husband. He\nthought of Arya&rsquo;s letter of Lord Royce&rsquo;s letter, of Sansa&rsquo;s letter.</p>\n</p>",

Since then I\u2019ve grown as a person and I now know that GRRM being the man that he is thinks rape as a plot device is very cool and edgy. So many girls and women are subjected to sexual violence for the development of man and sometimes for the development of the female characters. So of course a rape scene could possibly happen in the books though GRRM did allegedly say he would never write a rape scene at it was happening. Who knows, he might leave it as a cliffhanger and we deal with the aftermath in the next chapter. Either way my faith in him is waning.</p>",
