Arya has shown she appreciates the work that is put into it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m sorry, my lady.&rdquo; <b>Arya suddenly felt bad for her, and ashamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I tore the acorn dress too. It was pretty.</b></i>&rdquo; - Arya IV, ASoS&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Maybe&hellip;I could wash it.</b>&rdquo; Arya said doubtfully.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Washing it wont do any good.&rdquo; Sansa said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk is ruined.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Then I&rsquo;ll&hellip;make you a new one.</b>&rdquo; Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa threw her head back in disdain.&nbsp;&ldquo;You? You couldn&rsquo;t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties</i>.&rdquo; - Sansa III, AGot</p><p>She has a tendency to rip her dresses and in Sansa&rsquo;s case she threw an orange slice at her, but she still shows remorse for both. You know she feels bad for Sansa because she actually offers to fix it. Arya should be more careful and thoughtful about all of that, but the girl is nine. Children are not know to be amazing at thinking ahead, like what happens when she ruins the dress.&nbsp;</p><p>Dresses and sewing is not stupid because she sees it as useless or women as lesser than [the women are important too!], she hates it because she is not good at it. Not only is she not good at it her sister is good at it and everyone compares her to Sansa, which usually does not go in Arya&rsquo;s favor.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;  <i>Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. <b>Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother&rsquo;s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys.</b> <b>Arya</b> took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i>&rdquo; - Arya I, AGoT&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I ruined that gown that Lady Smallwood gave me, and I don&rsquo;t sew so good.&rdquo; She chewed her lip. &ldquo;<b>I don&rsquo;t sew very well, I mean. Septa Mordane used to say I had a blacksmith&rsquo;s hands</b>.</i>&rdquo; - Arya VII, ASoS&nbsp;</p><p>Of course she thinks it&rsquo;s stupid. If she does not say that it is stupid then she has to admit it bothers her. She has to admit that being bad at sewing bothers her. Being compared to Sansa bothers her. Having the hands of a blacksmith bothers her. Arya is not going to admit any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>We also hear about that ivory silk dress again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Suddenly Arya remembered the morning she had thrown the orange in Sansa&rsquo;s face and gotten juice all over her <b>stupid ivory silk gown</b>. There had been some southron lordling at the tourney, her sister&rsquo;s <b>stupid</b> <b>friend Jeyne</b> was in love with him</i>.&rdquo; - Arya IV, ACoK&nbsp;</p><p>That gown still gets to her. The gown she was so worried about fixing is suddenly stupid. I think she still feels a bit bad for that one. And as for Jeyne Poole, Jeyne is Arya&rsquo;s childhood bully. Of course she is going to think of Jeyne as stupid. If Jeyne is not stupid then it matters what she has to say, and we know what Jeyne says does matter to Arya. If it didnt she would not have been hurt by the name calling. </p><p>Arya is one of the most emotional characters in the whole series, but she is not going to admit it. She is not going to admit she had weaknesses.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings up another important factor in her use of the word. Arya tends to call things stupid especially when she is scared and trying to be brave. With all of the things she has seen it is normal to be afraid. Most adults would be terrified going through what she has, but she is a child so she doesn&rsquo;t see it that way. Weakness? Stupid. The things that scare her? Stupid. The things that make her emotionally vulnerable? Stupid.&nbsp;</p><p>For example after the death of Lord Crewyn&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>When Arya asked who it was, one of the guards told her that Lord Cerwyn had died. The words felt like a kick in the belly. He could never have helped you anyway, she thought as the sisters drove the wagon through the gate. </i><b><i>He couldn&rsquo;t even help himself, you stupid mouse</i>.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>- Arya VII, ACoK</p><p>Arya was hoping that Lord Crewyn would get her out of Harrenhal and back to Winterfell. She had been so hopeful&hellip;and then he died. Arya, generally, does not believe herself to be stupid but she does call herself that, especially when something goes wrong like her way out dying. Arya is mad she had hoped, that she had relied on this man to get her out. Instead of giving into the sadness of knowing she is still enslaved at Harrenhal, she chooses anger even if it is at herself.&nbsp;</p><p>When something is scary or hurts her it&rsquo;s automatically stupid.&nbsp;</p><p>Gendry wants to be a part of the Brotherhood without Banner&rsquo;s and leave her? He&rsquo;s stupid. Ned Dayne says that her father loved someone other than her mother? He&rsquo;s stupid too. The little girl who played with dolls like Arya once did? Stupid. The titan of Bravoos is kind of scary? It&rsquo;s stupid.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes Arya really is calling someone stupid, but most of the time she is trying to cope. It gets overlooked because it is such a normal childlike mechanism. Tons of children Arya&rsquo;s age do the same thing, but her stupid get puts to much more adult situations.&nbsp;</p></p>",
