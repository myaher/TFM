The two biggest moments in 3x18 would have been Bexie getting married and Muffy getting together; those moments didn\u2019t need to be in 3x18 itself but they do need to happen for the story to make sense.</p><p>We already know that the new pro basketball players visiting the school plot line was shot to replace the lost Muffy scenes at the original wedding and it looks like the Muffy bowling plot is now in 3x16 so the basketball players plot is likely going to be slotted in to 3x17 which would fit with what Josh said.</p><p>It\u2019s harder to tell when the new Bexie wedding will be. We know from the ep description and the promo that Bowie tells Bex in 3x16 that he still wants to get married so it has to happen sometime after that ep. If the wedding has to come fairly early for plot reasons than 3x17 would likely have room for a Mack family only wedding since there would have been Ham scenes they needed to cut. Or they could have re-worked the outdoor event in 3x20 to be a new wedding.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what would be moved into 3x19 though, it seems odd to have a Bexie wedding in that ep when they could have just waited another ep and have it at the gazebo in 3x20. They also had only one unaccounted for day of re-shoots for what probably were Mack family scenes. Maybe there was some convo between Bowie and Bex about maybe having another kid or Celia telling Bex that she\u2019s giving her sole ownership of Cloud 10 that needed to be salvaged. They filmed all of 3x18 at Snuck Farm but it is possible that they filmed a cold open or post script scene on one of the sets as they frequently film scenes for two different eps at Cloud 10 or the Red Rooster on the same day and were able to move it to another ep. We\u2019ll find out soon enough.</p>",

crush on tj from the campout in Hammer Time, and buffy gathers that cyrus ALSO has a crush on tj </p><p>* (either from texts or at some point in 3x14 or earlier in 3x15) </p><p>* the ghc+jonah plan to expose vivian (who i assume runs the company) for her wasteful clothing company by digging through the store&rsquo;s dumpster out back</p><p>* cyrus backs out last minute because he thinks it&rsquo;s a bit too risky and doesn&rsquo;t want to unnecessarily get in trouble</p><p>* (i guess, similar to how he backed out of the mount rushmore costume)</p><p>* he decides to go to the swings to chill </p><p>* MEANWHILE</p><p>* tj and kira are at the swings because kira made tj come</p><p>* tj is trying to have a good time but he can&rsquo;t because he misses cyrus</p><p>* the other post i made about the tj/kira swing scene comes in <a href=\"https://terri-does-gods-work.tumblr.com/post/185605567776/i-wrote-a-lil-sumn-based-on-the-0000002-seconds\">here</a></p><p>*however instead of tj leaving, he notices cyrus (which i will explain later on)</p><p>*(the tj/kira swing theory isn&rsquo;t based on anything but that one clip so it isn&rsquo;t OFFICIALLY part of this theory but it&rsquo;s related so i linked it)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d57843192a74bb80d4a3ad92f7ae1f88/tumblr_pt9ff8NU8R1tzv0to_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>* from the picture and the promo you can tell that tj is on the left and kira is on the right and they are facing away from the slide</p><p>* when tj jumps off the swing (along with kira) he goes down and TURNS AROUND, almost as though he&rsquo;s facing kira</p><p>*(the following clip is playing at x0.25 speed)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d90dcd4994cecf977f1b3bd12e3268dc/tumblr_pt9fubMPWG1tzv0to_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>* if he were to look further ahead in this direction he would be able to see cyrus approaching the swings on the other end (ie tj and cyrus&rsquo; swings)</p><p>* (this could be why they didn&rsquo;t show any more of that scene in the promo and stuck to the 1 nanosecond that i had to replay in slow motion a million times)</p><p>* tj notices cyrus AND cyrus notices tj</p><p>* cyrus says &ldquo;kira?&rdquo; to himself (assuming that&rsquo;s what you see him mouthing in the promo (thank you <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6oTDpfgqJmq2c_38_ih4qw\">@green-lemonboys</a> for pointing it out to me)) and starts walking away</p><p>* as he walks away, he looks back at tj (our first cyrus lookback (at tj) (i think))</p><p>* cyrus is distraught and ends up rejoining andi, buffy and jonah at the dumpster </p><p>* (which is where the split screen portion of the promo comes in)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb8a9339f07f76cc38dfc1e9ffeebc87/tumblr_pt9ghtbZSk1tzv0to_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>* they&rsquo;re all sitting in the (same) dumpster looking for clothes </p><p>* cyrus keeps getting text alerts (from tj) </p><p>* since jonah knows, perhaps he asks something like &ldquo;is that tj?&rdquo; </p><p>* (with a slightly worried expression on his face as we see in the promo)</p><p>* to which cyrus replies &ldquo;yes&rdquo; (or a variant of the like) </p><p>* buffy looks at cyrus knowingly </p><p>* andi is confused because she doesn&rsquo;t know anything about it but eventually she realises </p><p>* (hence the realisation face in the promo)</p><p>* (again this is assuming the realisation isn&rsquo;t about her parents or the company etc)</p><p>* when andi finally figures it out, cyrus tells them what he saw</p><p>* someone maybe says something like &ldquo;if he saw you walk away and he&rsquo;s texting you then he probably has a good reason&rdquo;</p><p>* cyrus agrees and leaves his friends to go talk to tj OR leaves to go home (i can&rsquo;t say for sure because there&rsquo;s no indication of what happens to cyrus in the promos or the episode summary) because he is confused (and rightly so)</p><p>* since cyrus has gone, it&rsquo;s only andi, buffy and jonah carrying out the garbage bags </p><p>* (this isn&rsquo;t particularly part of the theory but it kind of fits:)</p><p>* (based off a confession post i saw on instagram) cyrus goes to tj&rsquo;s house and knocks on his door</p><p>* tj opens the door with kira and says &ldquo;cyrus&rdquo; </p><p>* and the episode ends</p><p>* OR</p><p>* cyrus goes home and there&rsquo;s a knock at the door</p><p>* he opens it and all he says is &ldquo;tj?&rdquo;</p><p>* and the episode ends </p><p>* (the second one was mostly the instagram confession post i saw)</p><p>* (this theory is null and void if <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6oTDpfgqJmq2c_38_ih4qw\">@green-lemonboys</a>&rsquo;
