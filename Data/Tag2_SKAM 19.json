I thought he was gross and I sure as hell didn\u2019t want him with Daphn\u00e9 or any girls, but I had a friend like him in high school and he\u2019s one of my closest friends today (and he\u2019s not gross at all anymore).\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\n- I was CONVINCED that Lucas wasn\u2019t as much in the closet as Isak was. \n\n<br/></p><p>- I was pissed at Lucas during much of episode 3, I just wanted to shake some sense into him so badly. That episode was just cringe after cringe. I remember posting an anonymous comment about how I was glad Eliott didn\u2019t see Lucas\u2019 behavior that week because wow, what a little shit he was.<br/></p><p>- I loved the Kiffance clip (the one right before the party) and I actually prefer the scenes AFTER the kiffance party (although I rewatched the whole exchange from the moment Eliott arrives to the moment they run away many times and I love it a lot).<br/></p><p>- I was left a little\u00a0\u2018meh\u2019 after the whole\u00a0\u2018gays are funny\u2019/\u2019you\u2019re stereotyping\u2019 debate. I wanted a bit more than that. My reactions was kinda like\u00a0\u2018What? That\u2019s it?\u2019</p><p>- I was SURE they were going to kiss in episode 3&hellip; And sure they wouldn\u2019t in episode 4 up until the Trajeudi clip.</p><p>- Manon pissed me off in episode 4 and I wanted her to stop nagging Lucas about Eliott (especially when Lucas became hella defensive and ran back to Chlo\u00e9, after Manon went inquisition mode in SCHOOL&hellip;)</p><p>- The Trajeudi clip where Eliott offers to hang out with Lucas is in my top favorite clips. I just love it so much : it\u2019s hilarious, Maxence was GREAT in that scene, and yeah&hellip; Golden.</p><p>- I actually didn\u2019t realise at first that it was Polaris when I watched <i>Le Premier</i>. I felt actually a bit weirded out about the whole\u00a0\u2018horror movie\u2019 setting. It took me a couple of rewatches to FINALLY get it. Yeah. I\u2019m ashamed lmao.<br/></p><p>- I spent hours trying to assemble the letters by size and stuff to make sense of the Polaris puzzle lmao.</p><p>- Samedi 9h17 killed me. And it\u2019s my favorite version of this scene. Yep.</p><p>- I profoundly dislike(d) the \u2018phase de latence\u2019 clip. I really, really d(o)id. It was too fast and the script just didn\u2019t make any sense in my mind, jumping straight to the \u2018what would your parents say\u2019&hellip; Yeah, MEH. I was pissed at it the entire day too lmao. \n\n</p><p>- Mika\u2019s post on IG after his heated conversation with Lucas in episode 5 made me burst into tears.</p><p>- Even if I liked episode 5 and Axel completely killed it in the last clip, I felt that it was a bit too similar to OG.\u00a0</p><p>- But I actually ended up rewatching the last clip of episode 5 many times because Axel\u2019s face in the last few seconds is just&hellip; wow. He really impressed me.</p><p>- I thought episode 6 was a very strong episode and I really liked how they did the Monday clips\u00a0</p><p>- I was angry at Yann, but not at the writers for changing that last scene though.</p><p>- Intervention is probably one of my favorite clips. Simply brilliant and Axel blew my mind with his acting. I really felt that.</p><p>- I like episode 7 a lot but I thought there were a LOT of apologies lmao. (They should\u2019ve used some in season 4)</p><p>- I was a bit mad after the Chlo\u00e9 clip when Lucas pretty much thanked her for outing him.</p><p>- I missed Eliott like crazy during week 7 but I wanted them to TALK. So I was actually MAD when\u00a0\u2018\u00e7a compte pas\u2019 happened and their talk was&hellip; Not really a talk tbh. And I was also sure that they would never do anything in the common room. I ended up absolutely adoring it like an hour later lmao, but after the first watch I was not happy.\u00a0</p><p>- I liked Poni but I don\u2019t love it. I think I was expecting something a bit longer.\u00a0</p><p>- I like the\u00a0\u2018Terre Promise\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t get past the sound and image editing weirdness in some parts which took me out of that scene.</p><p>-\u00a0\u2018La Violence\u2019 was hilarious and I completely melted when Eliott came back for more kisses.</p><p>-\u00a0\u2018Pourvu qu\u2019elles m\u2019aiment\u2019 was very meh to me. I get why they did it like that but it doesn\u2019t mean I liked it. Probably my least favorite clip of the season.</p><p>- I actually rewatched the Friday clips of episode 8 many times that night, even if it hurt. I was just so impressed with those two scenes.\u00a0</p><p>- But I don\u2019t really care for the ham/champagne dialogue when they sit at the table tbh. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>- I LOVE the last Sunday clip of episode 9. I thought the editing was so good, even if it freaked me out.</p><p>- Lucas coming out to his mom made me cry but the second part of the clip felt a bit off to me.\u00a0</p><p>- I didn\u2019t cry after watching\u00a0\u2018T\u2019es plus tout seul\u2019 at first. But it hit me maybe an hour later and then I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I think I was in shock and once the shock passed it was over for me.</p><p>- Episode 10 was beautiful.\u00a0\u2018T\u2019es pas comme les autres\u2019 was amazing (although the music choice made me think of a commercial for a life insurance), and the whole sequence leading to the minute by minute scene blew me away. I loved how they did that, it was so well done and Maxence\u2019s acting felt really heartfelt and gripping.</p><p>- Sauvons le foyer just left me a bit meh but I was proud of Basile.</p><p>- It took me 30 minutes to watch\u00a0\u2018c\u2019est pas des adieux\u2019. I kept pausing because I felt what was coming and I wasn\u2019t ready lmao.</p><p>- I cried for hours after the end of season 3 and I didn\u2019t want to jump straight into season 4.</p><p>Will probably add some more to it if I think of other stuff.</p>",

She is so strong, but also so vulnerable, she is feminist, but also understanding and soft. I love og noora, but she had flaws that I feel they handled better with zo\u00eb. They stayed true to the character, but made it even better. I feel there is a lot more emotion in zo\u00eb. It really breaks my heart watching her suffer, more than usually and more than I tought it would \ud83d\ude2d</p><p><b>2. Eleonora</b> - she is actually a lot different than the og noora, she gives a different vibe, she is so much more gentle and soft and she is my second because I can identify with her the most. She is the biggest introvert out of all the nooras and as one, I can totally understand her and the way she thinks and behaves. She is such a good person, with such a big heart and so much love to give, she is so caring and beautiful in and out. So gentle and so understanding and she really feels so real to me because I see a lot of her in me. She is beautifully written and I love her so much.</p><p><b>3. Noora</b> - the reason I love season 2 the most is because noora is my favorite character. I can identify with her in a lot of ways, and I like her feminism and heart and how strong she is. She will always have a speacial place in my heart because she is the original one and she started it all. Without her, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any other and she will always be so dear to me.</p><p><b>4. Liv</b> - when I answered the question including who my favorite noora remake is a few weeks ago I wrote zo\u00eb and liv. And now I did place eleonora above because I&rsquo;ve watched her season until the end and it just made me realize after it ended how much I love her and how much I can identify with her, so that&rsquo;s the reason why liv is now placed lower than her. She is also so strong and caring, such a good friend and is great, independent, talented, caring and really beautiful in and out. At the begininng of season 2, I did find her being a little too hard on noah, but I still love them and her. She is a real queen.</p><p><b>5. Mia</b> - after just season 1, mia was my favorite noora and I still love her sooo much. I even feel a little guilty for not placing her higher and it was a really tough call between liv and her, but after a lot of thinking I had to go with this order. The reason why I placed liv higher is because I think she handled the whole situation with engel a lot better than mia with kiki, and liv just generally seemed like a better friend during that whole situation. But, I still love mia so much. She is the strongest and probably the biggest feminist and I just like how determined she is and how they developed her and her relationship with alex in a way that didn&rsquo;t make her loose who she is. I honestly wish I could be more like her.</p><p><b>6. Nora</b> - tbh, I know too little about her because she didn&rsquo;t get her season yet, so she is not that developed yet. But, I do like her for now, I like how they are handling her right now, and how she has similarities with the og noora, but is also more unique and not just a copy. She gives that certain vibe that I like and I&rsquo;m really interested to see her season. I hope I&rsquo;ll get to like her even more.</p><p><b>7. Manon</b> - I don&rsquo;t have much to say about her, she is mostly a copy of og, but not as good, and she is okay. I don&rsquo;t have anything against her, but I&rsquo;m really sorry about how bad they handled her and her relationship with charles in season 4. I didn&rsquo;t even understand the whole drama and I don&rsquo;t get what was all that about with her and sofiane. Like??? It really seemed like she knew imane liked him, I mean yeah, she asked her and she said she doesn&rsquo;t, but still, it was so obvious and even if she wasn&rsquo;t sure, you don&rsquo;t just go and date your best friend&rsquo;s possible crush? Idk, I&rsquo;m just really confused with how all of that played out, and they didn&rsquo;t even explain it properly. Same thing with charles. She was so against getting back with him the whole season and then she just got back with him all of a sudden without a word od explanation?? So confused about all of that, it was so unnecessary and rushed and it makes just zero sense. She was just so out of character during the whole season 4 and I&rsquo;m really sorry about how it all played out, because she is really not bad and she definitely deserves better. Getting back with charles was a big disappointment for me.</p><p><b>8. Grace</b> - didn&rsquo;t like her at all in season 1 and in season 2 she did got better and I do think that SA was handled the best with her (except maybe with zo\u00eb, but I still have to see that playing out &lsquo;till the end to judge), she was cute with daniel and she did grow on me in season 2 a little because she did get better. But, I&rsquo;m still not the biggest fan, it&rsquo;s not anymore that I don&rsquo;t like her at all, I do, but not a lot. She doesn&rsquo;t really give me noora vibes and sometimes she annoys me. But, I really liked how she put daniel in his place, telling him what happened happened to her and not him. That was really powerful and strong. So, she is okay, but not as much as the og, and I do like her, but she is just my least favorite out of all the others.</p>",
