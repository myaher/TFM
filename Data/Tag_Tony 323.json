And thank you so much for being my third request! I really hope you enjoy this imagine! I was really excited for it! </i></p><p>Her eyes were pink and swollen, her cheeks sticky with the tears that had been falling for over four hours now. The only sound that had been coming from her room had been her sobs as she buried her face deep into her knees. It was almost a wonder how nobody could hear her. The weather painted a perfect picture of her current emotions, the rain pounding against her window as the thunder almost overpowered her cries. It was quite possibly the worst she&rsquo;s ever felt.</p><p>Of course, when Y/N truly thought about it, perhaps she was being a stereotypical teenage girl who simply dwelled far more into a high school relationship as every girl did at that age, but she didn&rsquo;t want to think about that. She truly thought she and him were meant to be. At the time, Damon Everdeen seemed like the perfect boy in the world. For a moment, he actually seemed as though he were the one for her. He was polite to her father(even if Tony still didn&rsquo;t like him), he practically spoiled her on dates, and the two of them were almost on cloud nine just about everyday.</p><p>The rumors had been there since the very beginning. </p><p>&lsquo;Damon is only with Y/N Stark to get to her father!&rsquo;</p><p>'It&rsquo;s been his dream to work at Stark Industries since he was in the sixth grade!&rsquo;</p><p>'Without Y/N, Damon would never even be able to meet Mr. Stark!&rsquo;</p><p>She never believed them. She never wanted to. Damon would never do that to her, right? He was a good guy!</p><p>But then he had texted her unexpectedly that morning. It started out normal, wishing her a good morning and telling her applications were starting soon and he had one thing on his mind; of course, Y/N was quite eager for him to work with her father at first. That would mean they&rsquo;d be together almost all the time! Who wouldn&rsquo;t want that? But when Damon started suggested that she put in a good word for him with her father it started to get fishy, and he started to get pushy.</p><p>When she finally told him she couldn&rsquo;t do that, he finally got angry and started sending a spiral of messages that he&rsquo;s been too good to her and she was not returning the favor. Then he mentioned the fact that without him, she&rsquo;d be alone for good. Nobody else would want her. After all, she&rsquo;d only be good as the trophy wife, simply a little treat since she was the Tony Stark&rsquo;s daughter. When she asked him why he was acting this way, he finally admitted that the only reason he was with her was so Tony could meet him and possibly help him be hired with Stark Industries.</p><p>Y/N had never felt more betrayed. She had never felt more angry or insecure. Is that all she was? Tony Stark&rsquo;s daughter? Was that going to be the only thing guys wanted from her, to get to her father? She really thought Damon loved her for her, she would&rsquo;ve never imagined that he would do something like this. It had never ever crossed her mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Stark,&rdquo; JARVIS&rsquo; voice suddenly filled her room. &ldquo;Your father has finished with dinner and is now requesting your appearance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rdquo; Y/N growled.</p><p>&ldquo;He also assumed that would be your response and has implored for me to tell you that you will attend dinner otherwise,&rdquo; JARVIS continued, making Y/N groan loudly. How could she go out to dinner like this? Her eyes were pink and swollen, her hair a matted mess, and these were the same clothes she&rsquo;s been wearing since that morning and they were completely wrinkled and stained with her tears. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Y/N snapped, getting to her feet and wiping her face, finger combing her hair along the way toward the dining room so she could look halfway decent. She was sure the team was there for dinner, as they always were, so if they commented on her appearance, surely her father would be alarmed. He was always so protective over her. Y/N dreaded him telling her, 'I told you so!&rsquo;, considering he never trusted Damon in the first place.</p><p>She heard their mingled voices from just around the corner. Pausing for a minute to gather her bearings, she finally stepped around and ducked her head beneath her shoulders, shielding her face as she went to the nearest empty chair that was, unfortunately, occupied by her father.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s meatloaf night, kiddo,&rdquo; Tony sang, unaware of his daughter&rsquo;s state since her face was still hidden. &ldquo;Eat up!&rdquo; He pushed a chair in front of her, making her flinch since it nearly hit her face, but that was a bad idea since the reaction was quick and immediate.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, have you been crying?&rdquo; Steve asked, who was sitting right across from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Crying? What?&rdquo; Tony returned with the full platter of meatloaf, seeming to be handing it off to everyone. &ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo; He tossed the platter carelessly aside on the table, gently pulling Y/N so she faced him fully, pushing a string of her hair behind her ear as he inspected her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Y/N lied, trying to turn back to her food.</p><p>&ldquo;Who do I need to kill?&rdquo; Bucky asked instantly, already getting to his feet along with Scott and Sam. </p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; Y/N called, holding her hands out. &ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m fine! I promise you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy problem,&rdquo; someone called out. Natasha was staring at her carefully and seemed to recognize the tears with ease; after all, she was a woman. &ldquo;What did that Everdeen do? Did he put his hands on you?&rdquo; The reaction was even worse, then, since most of the table now began to get up, all speaking simultaneously about suiting up.</p><p>&ldquo;No! You guys, he didn&rsquo;t hit me or anything like that!&rdquo; Y/N cried, jumping to her feet and pulling on the sleeve of the nearest person, who was Bruce. &ldquo;He just&hellip;he&hellip;h-he&hellip;&rdquo; Tears began to cloud her eyes once more as the memory hit her once more. She cursed to herself, beginning to wipe at her face as she let out a small cry, then more tears fell. </p><p>Tony suddenly embraced her tightly, pulling her face to his chest as he pet at her hair, trying to calm her as best as he could, but she only cried harder. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go sit in the living room so we can get to the bottom of this.&rdquo; Carefully, he leaned down and suddenly lifted her up in his arms and quickly made his way toward the front of the group, becoming the first to the couches and sitting her down there before he sat beside her, continuing to pet her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Bruce asked nervously as the rest of the team arrived. &ldquo;What did Damon do?&rdquo;</p><p>They all waited patiently for Y/N&rsquo;s tears to subside long enough for her to explain, which took a bit, but they were all very understanding.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess Dad was r-right about him,&rdquo; she whimpered, wiping her face. &ldquo;He was&hellip;he told me he was only with me so Dad would hire him at Stark Industries&hellip;that that was the only reason anyone would ever want me. Then he said it was over and he hasn&rsquo;t responded to any of my texts since. I just&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; Then she began to cry again, covering her face as she heaved in sorrow.</p><p>From behind her, Wanda leaned over the couch in order to hug her tightly, kissing the side of Y/N&rsquo;s head in comfort. Tony stiffened beside her and got to his feet, beginning to pace back and forth before he finally whipped around, his tone very dangerous, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna wring that little punk&rsquo;s neck&hellip; What kind of shithead does that to a girl, let alone MY daughter!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony-&rdquo; Natasha tried to calm him down.</p><p>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s it! He&rsquo;s&hellip;I need to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, your concern right now needs to be your daughter. We must worry about the juvenile later,&rdquo; Vision cut in. </p><p>&ldquo;The boy is a sorry excuse for a man!&rdquo; Thor exclaimed, his fists tightening. &ldquo;To treat Lady Y/N like that is inexcusable!&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha huffed at their threats and decided to sit by Y/N instead, also pulling her into an embrace like Wanda still was.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; Natasha said, smiling comfortingly as Y/N finally looked up at her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s completely stupid to let you go. You are smart, you&rsquo;re pretty, and I know you can kick ass while reciting poetry. You&rsquo;re a triple threat&hellip;and I know you think now all people see you as is your father&rsquo;s daughter, but you&rsquo;re so much more than that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked over at that, looking a tad guiltier now.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Wanda added, moving around the couch to take Tony&rsquo;s forgotten spot. &ldquo;Y/N Stark is the epitome of badass and beautiful. You are so much more&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N smiled now, feeling slightly better. Of course Wanda and Natasha were the better peacekeepers. While the others could understand, Wanda and Natasha had the better touches at boy troubles.</p><p>&ldquo;And I declare if that Damon ever goes near you, he will be ever so sorry to,&rdquo; Thor declared darkly, standing across from her. &ldquo;He does not deserve you Lady Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I can also help,&rdquo; Steve smiled thoughtfully, scurrying to Thor&rsquo;s side as he raised a hand up. &ldquo;I think we have about four tubs of ice cream.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I know just about every badass TV show Netflix has to offer,&rdquo; Sam added, grinning.</p><p>&ldquo;And meatloaf sucks,&rdquo; Scott stated, looking over at Tony. &ldquo;No offense, dude, but it&rsquo;s literally a loaf of meat, that&rsquo;s not okay. Let&rsquo;s skip out on that shit show and just binge the hell out of Netflix while we eat enough ice cream before we die. Sound good? Great. Oh, and I&rsquo;ll help you with getting it, Cap!&rdquo; He and the blond super soldier disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;We better stop them from making a mess,&rdquo; Wanda laughed, getting up with Natasha to go and help the boys. This gave Tony the opportunity to approach his daughter finally and kneel down in front of her, taking both of her hands tightly into his as he squeezed them comfortingly, trying to find the right words to say.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Y/N,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I wish I could do something to make you feel better&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, it&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; Y/N laughed softly. &ldquo;Really&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that little bastard wasn&rsquo;t good enough for you, and if he ever thinks of applying here at Stark Industries, I will personally make a home visit to tell him to his face he will never be qualified.&rdquo; Tony was very well known for acting on his words, too, &ldquo;but&hellip;besides that, even though I hate the thought of you with any boy, you do deserve someone who sees you for how goddamn amazing you are. And even though I&rsquo;ll definitely hate whoever it is&hellip;I&rsquo;ll be behind you the entire way.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N laughed softly and looked up at him, unable to keep herself from smiling. &ldquo;Thanks, Dad&hellip; I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, too,&rdquo; he replied, embracing her tightly to him.</p><p>A few moments later, Y/N slyly asked, &ldquo;So&hellip;if I were to mention my little crush on Spiderman-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;OKAY, WHERE&rsquo;S THAT ICE CREAM?&rdquo;</p>",

And thank you so much for being my third request! I really hope you enjoy this imagine! I was really excited for it! </i></p><p>Her eyes were pink and swollen, her cheeks sticky with the tears that had been falling for over four hours now. The only sound that had been coming from her room had been her sobs as she buried her face deep into her knees. It was almost a wonder how nobody could hear her. The weather painted a perfect picture of her current emotions, the rain pounding against her window as the thunder almost overpowered her cries. It was quite possibly the worst she\u2019s ever felt.</p><p>Of course, when Y/N truly thought about it, perhaps she was being a stereotypical teenage girl who simply dwelled far more into a high school relationship as every girl did at that age, but she didn\u2019t want to think about that. She truly thought she and him were meant to be. At the time, Damon Everdeen seemed like the perfect boy in the world. For a moment, he actually seemed as though he were the one for her. He was polite to her father(even if Tony still didn\u2019t like him), he practically spoiled her on dates, and the two of them were almost on cloud nine just about everyday.</p><p>The rumors had been there since the very beginning. </p><p>\u2018Damon is only with Y/N Stark to get to her father!\u2019</p><p>'It\u2019s been his dream to work at Stark Industries since he was in the sixth grade!\u2019</p><p>'Without Y/N, Damon would never even be able to meet Mr. Stark!\u2019</p><p>She never believed them. She never wanted to. Damon would never do that to her, right? He was a good guy!</p><p>But then he had texted her unexpectedly that morning. It started out normal, wishing her a good morning and telling her applications were starting soon and he had one thing on his mind; of course, Y/N was quite eager for him to work with her father at first. That would mean they\u2019d be together almost all the time! Who wouldn\u2019t want that? But when Damon started suggested that she put in a good word for him with her father it started to get fishy, and he started to get pushy.</p><p>When she finally told him she couldn\u2019t do that, he finally got angry and started sending a spiral of messages that he\u2019s been too good to her and she was not returning the favor. Then he mentioned the fact that without him, she\u2019d be alone for good. Nobody else would want her. After all, she\u2019d only be good as the trophy wife, simply a little treat since she was the Tony Stark\u2019s daughter. When she asked him why he was acting this way, he finally admitted that the only reason he was with her was so Tony could meet him and possibly help him be hired with Stark Industries.</p><p>Y/N had never felt more betrayed. She had never felt more angry or insecure. Is that all she was? Tony Stark\u2019s daughter? Was that going to be the only thing guys wanted from her, to get to her father? She really thought Damon loved her for her, she would\u2019ve never imagined that he would do something like this. It had never ever crossed her mind.</p><p>\u201cMiss Stark,\u201d JARVIS\u2019 voice suddenly filled her room. \u201cYour father has finished with dinner and is now requesting your appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Y/N growled.</p><p>\u201cHe also assumed that would be your response and has implored for me to tell you that you will attend dinner otherwise,\u201d JARVIS continued, making Y/N groan loudly. How could she go out to dinner like this? Her eyes were pink and swollen, her hair a matted mess, and these were the same clothes she\u2019s been wearing since that morning and they were completely wrinkled and stained with her tears. </p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Y/N snapped, getting to her feet and wiping her face, finger combing her hair along the way toward the dining room so she could look halfway decent. She was sure the team was there for dinner, as they always were, so if they commented on her appearance, surely her father would be alarmed. He was always so protective over her. Y/N dreaded him telling her, 'I told you so!\u2019, considering he never trusted Damon in the first place.</p><p>She heard their mingled voices from just around the corner. Pausing for a minute to gather her bearings, she finally stepped around and ducked her head beneath her shoulders, shielding her face as she went to the nearest empty chair that was, unfortunately, occupied by her father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meatloaf night, kiddo,\u201d Tony sang, unaware of his daughter\u2019s state since her face was still hidden. \u201cEat up!\u201d He pushed a chair in front of her, making her flinch since it nearly hit her face, but that was a bad idea since the reaction was quick and immediate.</p><p>\u201cY/N, have you been crying?\u201d Steve asked, who was sitting right across from her.</p><p>\u201cCrying? What?\u201d Tony returned with the full platter of meatloaf, seeming to be handing it off to everyone. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d He tossed the platter carelessly aside on the table, gently pulling Y/N so she faced him fully, pushing a string of her hair behind her ear as he inspected her face.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Y/N lied, trying to turn back to her food.</p><p>\u201cWho do I need to kill?\u201d Bucky asked instantly, already getting to his feet along with Scott and Sam. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Y/N called, holding her hands out. \u201cReally, I\u2019m fine! I promise you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy problem,\u201d someone called out. Natasha was staring at her carefully and seemed to recognize the tears with ease; after all, she was a woman. \u201cWhat did that Everdeen do? Did he put his hands on you?\u201d The reaction was even worse, then, since most of the table now began to get up, all speaking simultaneously about suiting up.</p><p>\u201cNo! You guys, he didn\u2019t hit me or anything like that!\u201d Y/N cried, jumping to her feet and pulling on the sleeve of the nearest person, who was Bruce. \u201cHe just\u2026he\u2026h-he\u2026\u201d Tears began to cloud her eyes once more as the memory hit her once more. She cursed to herself, beginning to wipe at her face as she let out a small cry, then more tears fell. </p><p>Tony suddenly embraced her tightly, pulling her face to his chest as he pet at her hair, trying to calm her as best as he could, but she only cried harder. \u201cLet\u2019s all go sit in the living room so we can get to the bottom of this.\u201d Carefully, he leaned down and suddenly lifted her up in his arms and quickly made his way toward the front of the group, becoming the first to the couches and sitting her down there before he sat beside her, continuing to pet her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Bruce asked nervously as the rest of the team arrived. \u201cWhat did Damon do?\u201d</p><p>They all waited patiently for Y/N\u2019s tears to subside long enough for her to explain, which took a bit, but they were all very understanding.</p><p>\u201cI guess Dad was r-right about him,\u201d she whimpered, wiping her face. \u201cHe was\u2026he told me he was only with me so Dad would hire him at Stark Industries\u2026that that was the only reason anyone would ever want me. Then he said it was over and he hasn\u2019t responded to any of my texts since. I just\u2026I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Then she began to cry again, covering her face as she heaved in sorrow.</p><p>From behind her, Wanda leaned over the couch in order to hug her tightly, kissing the side of Y/N\u2019s head in comfort. Tony stiffened beside her and got to his feet, beginning to pace back and forth before he finally whipped around, his tone very dangerous, \u201cI\u2019m gonna wring that little punk\u2019s neck\u2026 What kind of shithead does that to a girl, let alone MY daughter!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony-\u201d Natasha tried to calm him down.</p><p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s it! He\u2019s\u2026I need to\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, your concern right now needs to be your daughter. We must worry about the juvenile later,\u201d Vision cut in. </p><p>\u201cThe boy is a sorry excuse for a man!\u201d Thor exclaimed, his fists tightening. \u201cTo treat Lady Y/N like that is inexcusable!\u201d</p><p>Natasha huffed at their threats and decided to sit by Y/N instead, also pulling her into an embrace like Wanda still was.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Natasha said, smiling comfortingly as Y/N finally looked up at her. \u201cHe\u2019s completely stupid to let you go. You are smart, you\u2019re pretty, and I know you can kick ass while reciting poetry. You\u2019re a triple threat\u2026and I know you think now all people see you as is your father\u2019s daughter, but you\u2019re so much more than that\u2026\u201d</p><p>Tony looked over at that, looking a tad guiltier now.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s right,\u201d Wanda added, moving around the couch to take Tony\u2019s forgotten spot. \u201cY/N Stark is the epitome of badass and beautiful. You are so much more\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled now, feeling slightly better. Of course Wanda and Natasha were the better peacekeepers. While the others could understand, Wanda and Natasha had the better touches at boy troubles.</p><p>\u201cAnd I declare if that Damon ever goes near you, he will be ever so sorry to,\u201d Thor declared darkly, standing across from her. \u201cHe does not deserve you Lady Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can also help,\u201d Steve smiled thoughtfully, scurrying to Thor\u2019s side as he raised a hand up. \u201cI think we have about four tubs of ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know just about every badass TV show Netflix has to offer,\u201d Sam added, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAnd meatloaf sucks,\u201d Scott stated, looking over at Tony. \u201cNo offense, dude, but it\u2019s literally a loaf of meat, that\u2019s not okay. Let\u2019s skip out on that shit show and just binge the hell out of Netflix while we eat enough ice cream before we die. Sound good? Great. Oh, and I\u2019ll help you with getting it, Cap!\u201d He and the blond super soldier disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWe better stop them from making a mess,\u201d Wanda laughed, getting up with Natasha to go and help the boys. This gave Tony the opportunity to approach his daughter finally and kneel down in front of her, taking both of her hands tightly into his as he squeezed them comfortingly, trying to find the right words to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Y/N,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI wish I could do something to make you feel better\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Y/N laughed softly. \u201cReally\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that little bastard wasn\u2019t good enough for you, and if he ever thinks of applying here at Stark Industries, I will personally make a home visit to tell him to his face he will never be qualified.\u201d Tony was very well known for acting on his words, too, \u201cbut\u2026besides that, even though I hate the thought of you with any boy, you do deserve someone who sees you for how goddamn amazing you are. And even though I\u2019ll definitely hate whoever it is\u2026I\u2019ll be behind you the entire way.\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed softly and looked up at him, unable to keep herself from smiling. \u201cThanks, Dad\u2026 I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he replied, embracing her tightly to him.</p><p>A few moments later, Y/N slyly asked, \u201cSo\u2026if I were to mention my little crush on Spiderman-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOKAY, WHERE\u2019S THAT ICE CREAM?\u201d</p></p>",

One secret, however, he kept within himself all his life since he was about five years old. Even if he didn&rsquo;t completely understand it at that age, he does now at the age of fifteen years.</p><p>That very secret is what eats him alive day and night, do you want to know what that secret is? Peter Parker is transgender and the only few who knew was his Aunt May and his best friend Cairo C&eacute;drick. Then July 2nd, 2016 came the worst year of his life.</p><p>Now he is back in the closet when he is living with his two &ldquo;dads&rdquo; Tony Stark and Dr. Stephen Strange in Malibu, California. It has been two years since the accident. Can he keep going on like this?</p><p>Words: 2855, Chapters: 1/20, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FSpider-Man%2520-%2520All%2520Media%2520Types%2Fworks&amp;t=Y2RkOGU2MmEzOGYzMDFiMzk4MGVlYzZlNzQyMDdmMzdkNTFhM2Y3YyxiZDc3YTE5YmQ3YjQ1Mzg4MjE0OWZlYmM5ZTU5YmZhOTI0N2JmYWQ3\" target=\"_blank\">Spider-Man - All Media Types</a>, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FThe%2520Avengers%2520%28Marvel%29%2520-%2520All%2520Media%2520Types%2Fworks&amp;t=MmQwYTkwNzY0OWE1NmQwNTI1MWFjNjUzMjdhNGQzMzY4ODFiOGI4YSxhNGVjODZhYjMxODAzMjUxODEzNThkNzM1MDJlOWU1NDQwN2Y5YTVk\" target=\"_blank\">The Avengers (Marvel) - All Media Types</a>, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FMarvel%2520Cinematic%2520Universe%2Fworks&amp;t=NWE0MThhMjdmNTllZmU1NzM5ZGEwZTQyZWY0ZDJhN2M4NTdkMTAzYywzYzdmMmIwNjkwMTI0ZWUzN2I1Mjg2YjlmOTYxZDc0ZTgyODc2OGU5\" target=\"_blank\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FTeen%2520And%2520Up%2520Audiences%2Fworks&amp;t=ZmRjNzgwYjliNGE4MTBiNjE5NDRjZjZiZDM5NjZmYTEzNDY2NWY0NiwxMTQ5ZTRjNWI0Nzc0MjdlNDk2ZjMwMmY5Y2NlZjgyZTIwNGVjMTA1\" target=\"_blank\">Teen And Up Audiences</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FGraphic%2520Depictions%2520Of%2520Violence%2Fworks&amp;t=ZWQ4ZmYwMjBiY2ExMGQ1ZDY1ODI3NmMxMmU4NWQ5OWYzNmVmZTdiMCxlYzhlOWQ0ZDIzMmFiZDQzYzI2YjE5M2ViYjIwN2RhODM1YjNhNTgy\" target=\"_blank\">Graphic Depictions Of Violence</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FM%2As%2AM%2Fworks&amp;t=MDYxMTU3N2NjZDJiMjNmMjFlZTc3ZmVhZTFjY2U1OWI4NTRkMmJiZSxiOGU4ZGM3ZjcwMGNjNDVmMGVhMzcwZTdlZmJkOWU3ZmQ2NDQ3Mjk4\" target=\"_blank\">M/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FPeter%2520Parker%2Fworks&amp;t=ZDk3NjgwYTA5M2YxNzkzNWRjYWY4YzM3NGViNjA1ZWUxOGNmYmY4YiwyZGFmMTAwNGJmZjU4MWMxZWUwNWM2NGRjODNkZWMzNWUwMzJhOTUx\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Parker</a>, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FTony%2520Stark%2Fworks&amp;t=ZGZjYTk4ZGJjYTNkMmU3YTc5YTliNzc2ZDYxODYwZmU2MDYwMzkwMCxjNjc0YzE5OWY3ZDE1NTMxNDVjYjQ2OGZkMzFmMDVhMzIyN2Y0ZTBm\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FStephen%2520Strange%2Fworks&amp;t=ZDk5NmVhNTMyYjRmYzllNThmYjE1Y2E3YmRkZTQwZTZmNGJiYjQ4YSw0YmYzOWQwNjk4MGM1NDZiMDRmOWVlZTUwOWNlMDYyOTM5ZWFkMDY0\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Strange</a>, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Ftags%2FJames%2520%2522Bucky%2522%2520Barnes%2Fworks&amp;t=NzVlMzc5MTQwN2QyYzJlM2VmZmE1NDk1YmY2NGFkZmVmMWFiZmYzYixmN2Y4OTIwMGEwMGE3MmJmMTYxNjg5MmU2YjQwYTE5NjU4ZmNlMDgz\" target=\"_blank\">James &ldquo;Bucky&rdquo;
