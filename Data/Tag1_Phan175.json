He has a tendency to find the strangest position to sit on, wherever he is. It\u2019s a trait that Phil hadn\u2019t known about before this weekend and one he\u2019s found himself grow very fond of.</p><p>There are lot of little things that are different now that they\u2019re together. It feels more real. Phil second guesses himself in ways he wouldn\u2019t do over Skype or text. Dan is a person, and he\u2019s just as pretty and just as ridiculous and just as clever in real life. Phil gets his camera out of his backpack. The sun is shining, creating warm spots over the city. One of them is on Dan, beaming down creating soft shadows and a tanned glow on his skin. </p><p>Dan snaps out of his thoughts and turns when he notices Phil move in his peripheral. Since they arrived to this off-center, private little park in the outskirts of the city Phil\u2019s been weirdly quiet. He stands up, tall and slim and with an air of confidence that Dan hadn\u2019t taken note of over the internet. It\u2019s in the way he holds himself. He can be strange and awkward sometimes, just like Dan, but he seems comfortable with himself. Dan both envies and admires the trait.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>Phil just points the camera at Dan, then takes a few steps back to find the perfect framing. He sticks his tongue out in concentration. Either he hadn\u2019t heard Dan\u2019s question or he\u2019s ignoring it.</p><p>Dan shifts where he\u2019s sat, stretches his back. Phil nods approvingly, snapping a couple shots.</p><p>\u201cIs this for twitter?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>He pouts his lips a little bit, musses his hair, and tilts his chin down. He wants to look good.</p><p>Phil clears his throat, shifts his weight to the other foot. He hasn\u2019t been thinking about twitter for hours. Not youtube either. Yesterday they filmed a q and a video, and since they turned the camera off afterwards he hasn\u2019t been thinking about content at all.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is for me,\u201d he answers earnestly.</p><p>Dan blushes. Phil can tell from the way his on-camera expression drops and a real smile hesitantly stretches his lips. Phil takes a step closer and snaps a photo. It comes out a bit blurry. Dan stretches one leg out and finds Phil\u2019s knee. He kicks softly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>He takes a step forwards and places a hand on Dan\u2019s shoulder. The touches are still new. They\u2019re so much. They create an energy field that could shock the breath out of him. Dan is so real. And his happy smile has become smug and teasing.</p><p>\u201cPut the camera down,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He grabs Phil\u2019s arm and pulls him closer. Phil\u2019s heart beats fast as he loses his footing and is pulled down onto the bench next to Dan with a graceless thump. He suddenly feels shy, caught doing something bad. They\u2019ve taken a lot of pictures these past days. Some were posted, others planned to be kept in a folder just for Phil. This is new, though. This isn\u2019t a selfie or a creep-shot or one he asked if he could take. Dan is grinning. Phil\u2019s camera is still in his hand, but in a loose grip on his lap.</p><p>\u201cI know a good picture you could take,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>His eyes flit down to Phil\u2019s lips. His mouth opens that little bit, small tongue slipping through the seams and wetting his lips like Phil\u2019s found he does before a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, trying not to stare back at Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>His eyes don\u2019t meet his. They\u2019re hooded as his gaze is fixed firmly on his objective.</p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth. Phil\u2019s mouth is the objective.</p><p>Dan leans forward and kisses him. This, they haven\u2019t done. They might be alone in this park, but people could pass and people could <i>see</i>. Phil\u2019s heart races, but he pushes into it and grabs Dan\u2019s jacket a bit too tightly. Eagerly. Something to hold on to so he can forget the fear.</p><p>They kiss slowly, sweetly. From tongues dancing together to innocent pecks. Somewhat restrained, not at all what they\u2019ve been doing in Phil\u2019s bedroom. Dan reaches for Phil\u2019s camera. Phil pulls away from the kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting it away, okay?\u201d Phil says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, taking his backpack from off the ground.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He chews his bottom lips. Then he says something else, but the words are so quiet and jumbled that Phil can\u2019t make out a single word.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Their eyes meet. Dan\u2019s cheeks are tinted red.</p><p>\u201cI want you to, um,\u201d he says, quietly still. \u201cI want you to take a picture when we kiss.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s cheeks go warm.</p><p>\u201cIs that such a good idea?\u201d he asks.</p><p>He wants to do it too. He wants some type of visual, lasting proof that Dan is his and he is Dan\u2019s. Not in flirty messages online. Just this. What\u2019s really going on. But what if somebody hacked him or found out in some way?</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Dan shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t argue. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>He kisses Phil again, and he\u2019s taken aback. For all the moments of shyness, Dan always manages to find some confidence inside that overrides it. Especially if he\u2019s questioned, Phil\u2019s noticed. He is very good at making Phil do what he wants, almost dangerously so, and Phil finds himself dropping the backpack and leaning into the kiss, still holding the camera..</p><p>He lets Dan pry it out of his hand and point it on them. Dan smiles, and a breath of laughter bubbles out of him and Phils laughs back. The camera clicks as Dan snaps the photo.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have a single thought about passing people or general onlookers now. All he sees are Dan\u2019s crinkled eyes and stretched lips and all he can think about is how close they are to his.</p><p>Dan kisses him again and clicks the camera.</p><p>\u201cWhat you want, a photo album?\u201d Phil chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYour camera\u2019s shit, mate,\u201d Dan counters. \u201cWe need at least one that won\u2019t come out blurry.\u201d</p><p>Phil reaches out and grabs Dan\u2019s outstretched arm. He forces it down, but once Dan goes with the movement he rubs reassuring circles on the bone of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s plenty,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan agrees.</p><p>They part, Phil puts the camera away in his bag. He glances at Dan who\u2019s simply looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI want to keep kissing you,\u201d Dan says. \u201cShall we go back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>He really wants to kiss Dan more, too. He wants to keep exploring how far they can go before Dan has to go home. So far it\u2019s been dry humps and frustratingly long make out sessions that leave Phil aching. Maybe this time they\u2019ll take another step further.</p>",

He sticks his tongue out in concentration. Either he hadn\u2019t heard Dan\u2019s question or he\u2019s ignoring it.</p><p>Dan shifts where he\u2019s sat, stretches his back. Phil nods approvingly, snapping a couple shots.</p><p>\u201cIs this for twitter?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>He pouts his lips a little bit, musses his hair, and tilts his chin down. He wants to look good.</p><p>Phil clears his throat, shifts his weight to the other foot. He hasn\u2019t been thinking about twitter for hours. Not youtube either. Yesterday they filmed a q and a video, and since they turned the camera off afterwards he hasn\u2019t been thinking about content at all.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is for me,\u201d he answers earnestly.</p><p>Dan blushes. Phil can tell from the way his on-camera expression drops and a real smile hesitantly stretches his lips. Phil takes a step closer and snaps a photo. It comes out a bit blurry. Dan stretches one leg out and finds Phil\u2019s knee. He kicks softly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>He takes a step forwards and places a hand on Dan\u2019s shoulder. The touches are still new. They\u2019re so much. They create an energy field that could shock the breath out of him. Dan is so real. And his happy smile has become smug and teasing.</p><p>\u201cPut the camera down,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He grabs Phil\u2019s arm and pulls him closer. Phil\u2019s heart beats fast as he loses his footing and is pulled down onto the bench next to Dan with a graceless thump. He suddenly feels shy, caught doing something bad. They\u2019ve taken a lot of pictures these past days. Some were posted, others planned to be kept in a folder just for Phil. This is new, though. This isn\u2019t a selfie or a creep-shot or one he asked if he could take. Dan is grinning. Phil\u2019s camera is still in his hand, but in a loose grip on his lap.</p><p>\u201cI know a good picture you could take,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>His eyes flit down to Phil\u2019s lips. His mouth opens that little bit, small tongue slipping through the seams and wetting his lips like Phil\u2019s found he does before a kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, trying not to stare back at Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>His eyes don\u2019t meet his. They\u2019re hooded as his gaze is fixed firmly on his objective.</p><p>Phil\u2019s mouth. Phil\u2019s mouth is the objective.</p><p>Dan leans forward and kisses him. This, they haven\u2019t done. They might be alone in this park, but people could pass and people could <i>see</i>. Phil\u2019s heart races, but he pushes into it and grabs Dan\u2019s jacket a bit too tightly. Eagerly. Something to hold on to so he can forget the fear.</p><p>They kiss slowly, sweetly. From tongues dancing together to innocent pecks. Somewhat restrained, not at all what they\u2019ve been doing in Phil\u2019s bedroom. Dan reaches for Phil\u2019s camera. Phil pulls away from the kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting it away, okay?\u201d Phil says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, taking his backpack from off the ground.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>He chews his bottom lips. Then he says something else, but the words are so quiet and jumbled that Phil can\u2019t make out a single word.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Their eyes meet. Dan\u2019s cheeks are tinted red.</p><p>\u201cI want you to, um,\u201d he says, quietly still. \u201cI want you to take a picture when we kiss.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s cheeks go warm.</p><p>\u201cIs that such a good idea?\u201d he asks.</p><p>He wants to do it too. He wants some type of visual, lasting proof that Dan is his and he is Dan\u2019s. Not in flirty messages online. Just this. What\u2019s really going on. But what if somebody hacked him or found out in some way?</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Dan shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t argue. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>He kisses Phil again, and he\u2019s taken aback. For all the moments of shyness, Dan always manages to find some confidence inside that overrides it. Especially if he\u2019s questioned, Phil\u2019s noticed. He is very good at making Phil do what he wants, almost dangerously so, and Phil finds himself dropping the backpack and leaning into the kiss, still holding the camera..</p><p>He lets Dan pry it out of his hand and point it on them. Dan smiles, and a breath of laughter bubbles out of him and Phils laughs back. The camera clicks as Dan snaps the photo.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have a single thought about passing people or general onlookers now. All he sees are Dan\u2019s crinkled eyes and stretched lips and all he can think about is how close they are to his.</p><p>Dan kisses him again and clicks the camera.</p><p>\u201cWhat you want, a photo album?\u201d Phil chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYour camera\u2019s shit, mate,\u201d Dan counters. \u201cWe need at least one that won\u2019t come out blurry.\u201d</p><p>Phil reaches out and grabs Dan\u2019s outstretched arm. He forces it down, but once Dan goes with the movement he rubs reassuring circles on the bone of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s plenty,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan agrees.</p><p>They part, Phil puts the camera away in his bag. He glances at Dan who\u2019s simply looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI want to keep kissing you,\u201d Dan says. \u201cShall we go back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>He really wants to kiss Dan more, too. He wants to keep exploring how far they can go before Dan has to go home. So far it\u2019s been dry humps and frustratingly long make out sessions that leave Phil aching. Maybe this time they\u2019ll take another step further.</p></p>",

Dan is sitting next to him on a bench, legs crossed and straightened fringe covering one of his eyes.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t believe Dan&rsquo;s tight black jeans have enough give to allow the position, but Dan somehow manages. He has a tendency to find the strangest position to sit on, wherever he is. It&rsquo;s a trait that Phil hadn&rsquo;t known about before this weekend and one he&rsquo;s found himself grow very fond of.</p><p>There are lot of little things that are different now that they&rsquo;re together. It feels more real. Phil second guesses himself in ways he wouldn&rsquo;t do over Skype or text. Dan is a person, and he&rsquo;s just as pretty and just as ridiculous and just as clever in real life. Phil gets his camera out of his backpack. The sun is shining, creating warm spots over the city. One of them is on Dan, beaming down creating soft shadows and a tanned glow on his skin. </p><p>Dan snaps out of his thoughts and turns when he notices Phil move in his peripheral. Since they arrived to this off-center, private little park in the outskirts of the city Phil&rsquo;s been weirdly quiet. He stands up, tall and slim and with an air of confidence that Dan hadn&rsquo;t taken note of over the internet. It&rsquo;s in the way he holds himself. He can be strange and awkward sometimes, just like Dan, but he seems comfortable with himself. Dan both envies and admires the trait.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Dan asks.</p><p>Phil just points the camera at Dan, then takes a few steps back to find the perfect framing.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>I like the ambiguous time period idea of this.</b></p>\n<p>West Side High School was a school like any other, in regards to the fact that every faction was at war with each other. Classrooms were divided, the lunch room was a war zone, and the kids there only had one rule: Anything goes.</p>\n<p>Drugs, sex, alcohol, and many other illegal acts and substances ran rampant through the corrupted halls. Fights were always breaking out, but no one ever seemed to care besides the students themselves. To be a loner was to have a target on your back, and it was because of that most students belonged to one gang or another. Two of the gangs we&rsquo;ll be talking about in the story- the Ghosts and the Lions- were controlled by two kids who couldn&rsquo;t be more similar and yet so different.</p>\n<p>Daniel Howell, 18 years old, was the leader of the Ghosts. They had faux leather jackets, black skinny jeans, band shirts, studs, spikes, and a punk attitude. Any given member of the Ghosts had a shrine to Satan or a summoning area in their locker. It was rumored that Dan himself was a witch, but no one had ever been able to confirm or deny this.</p>\n<p>Philip Lester, 19 years old, was the leader of the Lions. The Lions composed the majority of the school&rsquo;s limited sports teams. Therefore, their uniforms were Letterman jackets. They had just as much brain as brawn, and put up a formidable fight to any adversary. Think Jocks vs Punks, but they&rsquo;re all kind of punk in a way. Other factions included gangs like bikers, drug dealers, hookers, and more. We&rsquo;re looking at like a South Side High situation from Riverdale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the world as we know it, however. This is an alternate reality, and therefore there are some things you should know. In this alternate reality, time is even more fluid than we understand. What I mean by that is at the same time these kids are going to school, knights are going on crusades and everyone&rsquo;s scared of Hitler. Everything seems to be going on at once, meaning that some of the customs that have died out in our time have remained, including arranged marriages. However, some things in our time have remained too, like the legality of gay marriage. Because of this, Dan and Phil are in fact promised to each other- a secret the two must carry and hide from the rest of the school.</p>\n</p>",
