        "body": "<h1>And I&hellip;Am Spider-Man</h1><p>A part of him was screaming to lay there and accept the new world. The rational and sane part of him told him to get his lazy ass up and fight for Morgan. For Pepper. For the kid. Tony struggled to stand against the rubble, feeling worse than he had back on the moon Titan. Compared to being smashed by a literal moon and being exploded then beaten up&hellip;he felt he needed a new retirement. He finally stood up and took to aim his blaster before jarring himself to a stop.</p><p>The kid had come back. Spider-Man landed on the raised hand and pulled at it with his strength, his feet digging into Thanos\u2019 bicep as his back arched and his face scrunched to pull at the gauntlet one last time. The Mad Titan shook his arm, winding it around, as if swatting at an actual spider. Tony felt the power within him rise as his own protege was holding tightly onto the gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d He yelled, standing up again and aiming. His blasters didn\u2019t have a lot of power left-his suit was too damaged to hold charge-so he had one last shot. He eyed it, aiming for the monster\u2019s head and firing off as the power sent his weakened state leaning back against the rubble.</p><p>In one quick whip, however, Thanos pulled the kid up like a small shield and Tony watched in horror as his own blast hit the back of the teenage superhero. He didn\u2019t cry out, he didn\u2019t scream&hellip;rather, his body reacted with a tightening of his muscles and an arching of his back before Thanos whipped him around and threw him into the rubble far from Tony.</p><p>\u201cPETE!\u201d He screamed out, watching the body of the small spiderling slam into the rubble and fall onto the ground with no noise. He no longer moved, but Tony watched as some of him started&hellip;sparkling? Was it actual sparks from the hit? Was his body smoking? He had no time to think, as Thanos\u2019 laughter echoed and Tony stared at him with the most anger he felt since that day back on Titan.</p><p>\u201cA valiant effort from the small one.\u201d He stated, raising the gauntlet again and pressing his middle and thumb together as time start to slow down. \u201cBut no matter what any of you do&hellip;I am inevitable.\u201d</p><p>The world was silent if only for the metal *thunk* and scrapping the two fingers made as they clicked.</p><p>The fighting was still going on, the only audience was Tony and Thanos to the failed attempt. Thanos look at the gauntlet and snapped it again. And again. The same sound going off both times before he stared in horror and Tony felt the same rising to his throat. Before Thanos looked, Tony turned to the now standing Spider-Man.</p><p>He was leaning against the rubble, his legs shaking as he stood and his left arm holding up what looked like an oddly-bent but glowing right hand. His fist was tightly clenched as it shook and his teeth were grinding together as he stared with pure hated in his deep brown eyes. </p><p>His fits glowed with rainbow powers as it flowed through him, while five familiar stones sat planted within his suit\u2019s hand. </p><p>Thanos finally took notice of the barely-standing teenager. He glared at him and slowly started stalking towards him. Tony\u2019s heart raced, and he swore he felt it hammering against the nanotech that made his own suit. Tony stared in fear and said, \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. how much power is left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout 4% sir,\u201d The cocky woman\u2019s voice echoed.</p><p>A swore slipped his lips before he started staggering over to Peter. The boy-gosh, was he really that young? Young enough to fight a titan on a random moon and still complain about finals?-he took two steps before falling onto his chest. He felt too weak, his suit was too weak. The stabilizers he had implanted after Rhodey\u2019s fall weren\u2019t charged enough to keep him standing. He groaned and pushed himself, looking over at Peter and staring there.</p><p>He was looking right back. And as Thanos approached, Peter put his fingers together as if ready to\u2026\u201dPeter NO!\u201d Tony screamed, tears welling in his eyes. No. Nononononononono. This isn\u2019t what was supposed to happen. Not him. Not again\u2026!</p><p>He vaguely saw Peter\u2019s mouth move and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d before there was a blast of light followed by a click.</p><p>When the light faded, Tony opened his eyes and all he saw was green. Green grass, green leaves, birds chirped in his ears. He looked around and watched as the army faded into dust that crumbled all around the extremely confused Avengers. The Compound was back, completely intact, as if nothing was ever wrong. Within the Compound Tony could barely make out the figure of&hellip;red and green, with a yellow cape\u2026</p><p>Vision stood there, fading through the glass to go towards them. No Mind Stone in his forehead, but still there. Wanda crumbled to the ground and cried, watching him come back and land next to her. The two embraced and Tony\u2019s mind whirred in confusion and shock. What happened? How was Vision back? And where was\u2026</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d He looked up. The formerly battered Steve Rogers was now standing above him, perfect like always. As a matter of fact, not a single bruise or cut was on him and his suit and shield were completely intact. Tony moved slowly, his brain ready for the pain but his body moving fluidly without a single groan from his mouth. He felt like a new man. One who was never stuck in that cave back in the desert, who never fell through a space hole, one who never even stubbed his toe! He looked up at Steve, who kept a hand offered to help him up. Tony took it, slowly standing up and looking around.</p><p>The Avengers, the people of Wakanda, everyone&hellip;they were here. They were all okay. Thor was wielding Mjolnir and Stormbreaker, while Steve also had one of the lightning hammers in his hand. Rhodey was bending around, talking about how his legs and back don\u2019t hurt to Sam and a highly confused Bucky who was now holding his metal arm in his human left hand. Vision and Wanda were embracing when a gust of wind blew hard and beside them stood Quicksilver. Wanda gasped out and hugged him too, crying hard before pulling Vision into the three-person hug.</p><p>\u201cYou did it.\u201d Steve said, looking around in as much shock as Tony was. The two looked at each other before Steve looked at his hand. He saw it empty, as if expecting him to be the one wielding the stones.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Tony nearly whispered, his throat closing up as he finally turned and saw Pepper landing in her blue suit next to a fallen body of red and blue. Tony was quick to fly over with his re-charged suit and Steve ran over quickly.</p><p>Tony landed to see Pepper turn over Peter, who was looking a little worse for ware. His entire right half from his face to his hip was charred, as if he had been burned alive by that light blast. His eyes were closed but his chest was slowly moving. He was gasping. Tony knelt without looking at Pepper, pulling his helmet back and saying, \u201cHey. Hey kid&hellip;kid c\u2019mon wake up we won.\u201d He lightly, as light as he could possibly make it, shook Peter\u2019s right shoulder.</p><p>The boy gasped and his eyes shot open before closing again, a cringe painting his face as he let out a hiss. Tony held his shoulder, whispering, \u201cBreathe, okay? Slow and steady\u2026\u201d He opened his eyes again as Steve finally joined the scene, alongside Clint and Thor. The original Avengers, all minus\u2026</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Peter whispered, barely moving his body other than his eyes and mouth. \u201cI&hellip;I tried to&hellip;bring everyone back. E-Everyone\u2026\u201d He let out another hiss of pain as his hand clutched in on itself, as if he were testing his limits. </p><p>Pepper backed up as Steve knelt next to him, patting him gently on his shoulder. \u201cYou did good Queens.\u201d He said, making Peter\u2019s lip twitch up into a smile.</p><p>\u201cW-Wow&hellip;tha&hellip;thanks C-Cap\u2019n.\u201d He let out a little chuckle before grimacing, whispering, \u201cWait until&hellip;I tell\u2026e\u2019eryone\u2026\u201d His head rolled to the side as his eyes started to close, his breathing slowing.</p><p>Tony jumped into action, unwilling to listen to that stupid part of reason in his brain. \u201cNo no kid, no sleeping on us, okay?\u201d He tapped the uncharred cheek lightly, bringing the kid\u2019s eyes back open. Tony looked at Steve and said, \u201cC\u2019mon, we gotta get him into the Compound. We can go congratulations and good jobs after he\u2019s all healed up. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He moved to put his arms under one leg and his shoulders when he felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Doctor Strange was there, looking down at him sadly. He blinked slowly and just held up a single finger.</p><p>One. One in 14 million and whatever chances they had at winning&hellip;this was the reality that they won. The reality in which Peter gave a sacrifice to stop Thanos.</p><p>The reality in which Peter Parker would die.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that one shit.\u201d Tony snapped, shoving his hands under Peter\u2019s slowly unmoving frame. \u201cWe still have time. He still has time. I won\u2019t let your magic mumbo-jumbo stop me from-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Tony looked up at Pepper, whose eyes were starting to well with tears. She knelt at Peter\u2019s feet, reaching over and grabbing his arm. \u201cHe needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes blinked back tears as he looked away from his wife to the kid he considered his son. He was barely breathing, his eyes fluttering and forcing to stay open. All because Tony said to stay awake. Pepper squeezed his forearm and he could barely hear her whisper over his pounding heart, \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her again before back to the kid. The boy he saw on YouTube stopping a whole truck from crashing into a bus one day and trying to pull together a halved boat the next. The friendly kid he knew loved to save and protect far past his neighborhood. The Spider-Man he helped shape into one hell of a hero.</p><p>Anthony Stark held Peter Parker\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cHey&hellip;hey kid\u2026\u201d Once the teen looked at him he smiled, holding his hand tighter and letting the tears fall freely. All this was for him. All of it. \u201cYou can sleep now, okay? We\u2019re gonna be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB&hellip;Bu&hellip;But New York\u2026\u201d He whimpered out, his breathing and voice withering out on him as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for it.\u201d Steven said, patting the boy on the shoulder again.</p><p>Tony looked at Steve in shock. The two shared a glance and Tony mouthed \u201cThank you,\u201d something solitary between only them. Steve nodded and Tony looked back at his kid.</p><p>\u201cThe Cap\u2019s got it, kid&hellip;go ahead and rest&hellip;You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d Tony smiled as tightly as he could, the tears washing down his cheeks and hitting the boy on the chest. Peter blinked once, twice, before closing his eyes and rolling his head.</p><p>There were three more breaths before Peter Parker, Spider-Man, had died.</p><p>1 Year Later</p><p>The air was cold staring up at the statue. The flowers brought a week ago were withered, he would need to ask F.R.I.D.A.Y. to schedule a cleaning soon.</p><p>After the day everything was fixed life returned to normal for everyone who was in the Soul Stone. Schools resumed, work started off again, and everything was relatively better. Those who were left behind after the Snap had to adjust but, since that day, things have gotten better. Of course, that was all for everyone who was a normal person.</p><p>Tony Stark wasn\u2019t a normal person.</p><p>The second the day after started he set funeral arrangements. He had to call Aunt May, who was almost as hysterical as he was, to get all the details right. His favorite colors, the music he liked, anything and everything needed to show the world their hero.</p><p>The third day he released the information to the world about what happened between the Avengers and Thanos. He told the story about how Spider-Man saved more than just his friendly neighborhood.</p><p>The fourth day he went home and hugged Morgan extra hard and kissed her head.</p><p>The fifth day the funeral for Spider-Man was held. Everyone was there. All the Avengers who had lived, had been Snapped, and had been brought back. The people who wanted to recognize the hero that save their world. Across the globe, that day, everyone mourned the loss of Spider-Man, while those closest mourned the loss of Peter Parker.</p><p>The sixth day everything was back to normal. There were few people who talked about the youngest Avenger and what he sacrificed. Everyone wanted to move on. Everyone wanted to forget. Everyone but Tony.</p><p>So, he built. He built his tears, his memories, his hopes, and his frustration into the standing monument for the fallen. It took him forever. Never using machines, only using his hands and what he could get. Only when he had to fly up high did he use his suit, but never for anything else.</p><p>Only a month ago did he finish the monument to Spider-Man. And now, staring up at it, he could still feel that tight knot of pain.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d A soft voice said. Tony looked behind him and saw a young man there. He had dark brown hair, chocolate eyes, soft freckles on his cheeks, and a scruffy beard. He stood just around Tony\u2019s height, maybe an inch or two taller. He wore a grey dress jacket, pressed red shirt, and black dress pants. The man wasn\u2019t looking at Tony, rather&hellip;he was looking up at Peter.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Tony asked, though his first question was how the hell he had gotten past the gates to get to the Compound in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked back at Tony and said, \u201cI was wondering&hellip;you wouldn\u2019t happen to have known Spider-Man, would you?\u201d The question was a bit jarring, but Tony nodded. \u201cHow close were you two?\u201d</p><p>Now that question threw him for a loop. It had been a while since he thought of what their relationship was like. Hell, even at the end Tony never really knew. He had a gut feeling to protect and care for Peter, like he had the second Morgan was born\u2026\u201dHe was like a son to me.\u201d Tony whispered, though not fully knowing it until he looked at the man again and seeing him smile.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He said before walking to stand beside him, staring up at the statue. Tony\u2019s confusion only grew as he looked at the man, getting a sense of familiarity that didn\u2019t strike him too hard. \u201cCan you tell me about him?\u201d The man asked, looking up at the statue and never deterring from his stare.</p><p>Tony smiled a bit, feeling like a knot that was tied in him was being let loose. \u201cYou know, after all this time no one has ever asked me that.\u201d The two looked at one another and Tony extended a hand. \u201cTony Stark.\u201d</p><p>The man took his hand in a firm grip, smiling wide as his cheeks look newly tear-stained. \u201cBenjamin Parker.\u201d </p><p>The two then shared stories about Peter Parker into the night, relishing in one another\u2019s company as both found peace in a man who lost a son.</p>",

He had no time to think, as Thanos\u2019 laughter echoed and Tony stared at him with the most anger he felt since that day back on Titan.</p><p>\u201cA valiant effort from the small one.\u201d He stated, raising the gauntlet again and pressing his middle and thumb together as time start to slow down. \u201cBut no matter what any of you do\u2026I am inevitable.\u201d</p><p>The world was silent if only for the metal *thunk* and scrapping the two fingers made as they clicked.</p><p>The fighting was still going on, the only audience was Tony and Thanos to the failed attempt. Thanos look at the gauntlet and snapped it again. And again. The same sound going off both times before he stared in horror and Tony felt the same rising to his throat. Before Thanos looked, Tony turned to the now standing Spider-Man.</p><p>He was leaning against the rubble, his legs shaking as he stood and his left arm holding up what looked like an oddly-bent but glowing right hand. His fist was tightly clenched as it shook and his teeth were grinding together as he stared with pure hated in his deep brown eyes. </p><p>His fits glowed with rainbow powers as it flowed through him, while five familiar stones sat planted within his suit\u2019s hand. </p><p>Thanos finally took notice of the barely-standing teenager. He glared at him and slowly started stalking towards him. Tony\u2019s heart raced, and he swore he felt it hammering against the nanotech that made his own suit. Tony stared in fear and said, \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. how much power is left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout 4% sir,\u201d The cocky woman\u2019s voice echoed.</p><p>A swore slipped his lips before he started staggering over to Peter. The boy-gosh, was he really that young? Young enough to fight a titan on a random moon and still complain about finals?-he took two steps before falling onto his chest. He felt too weak, his suit was too weak. The stabilizers he had implanted after Rhodey\u2019s fall weren\u2019t charged enough to keep him standing. He groaned and pushed himself, looking over at Peter and staring there.</p><p>He was looking right back. And as Thanos approached, Peter put his fingers together as if ready to\u2026\u201dPeter NO!\u201d Tony screamed, tears welling in his eyes. No. Nononononononono. This isn\u2019t what was supposed to happen. Not him. Not again\u2026!</p><p>He vaguely saw Peter\u2019s mouth move and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d before there was a blast of light followed by a click.</p><p>When the light faded, Tony opened his eyes and all he saw was green. Green grass, green leaves, birds chirped in his ears. He looked around and watched as the army faded into dust that crumbled all around the extremely confused Avengers. The Compound was back, completely intact, as if nothing was ever wrong. Within the Compound Tony could barely make out the figure of\u2026red and green, with a yellow cape\u2026</p><p>Vision stood there, fading through the glass to go towards them. No Mind Stone in his forehead, but still there. Wanda crumbled to the ground and cried, watching him come back and land next to her. The two embraced and Tony\u2019s mind whirred in confusion and shock. What happened? How was Vision back? And where was\u2026</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d He looked up. The formerly battered Steve Rogers was now standing above him, perfect like always. As a matter of fact, not a single bruise or cut was on him and his suit and shield were completely intact. Tony moved slowly, his brain ready for the pain but his body moving fluidly without a single groan from his mouth. He felt like a new man. One who was never stuck in that cave back in the desert, who never fell through a space hole, one who never even stubbed his toe! He looked up at Steve, who kept a hand offered to help him up. Tony took it, slowly standing up and looking around.</p><p>The Avengers, the people of Wakanda, everyone\u2026they were here. They were all okay. Thor was wielding Mjolnir and Stormbreaker, while Steve also had one of the lightning hammers in his hand. Rhodey was bending around, talking about how his legs and back don\u2019t hurt to Sam and a highly confused Bucky who was now holding his metal arm in his human left hand. Vision and Wanda were embracing when a gust of wind blew hard and beside them stood Quicksilver. Wanda gasped out and hugged him too, crying hard before pulling Vision into the three-person hug.</p><p>\u201cYou did it.\u201d Steve said, looking around in as much shock as Tony was. The two looked at each other before Steve looked at his hand. He saw it empty, as if expecting him to be the one wielding the stones.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Tony nearly whispered, his throat closing up as he finally turned and saw Pepper landing in her blue suit next to a fallen body of red and blue. Tony was quick to fly over with his re-charged suit and Steve ran over quickly.</p><p>Tony landed to see Pepper turn over Peter, who was looking a little worse for ware. His entire right half from his face to his hip was charred, as if he had been burned alive by that light blast. His eyes were closed but his chest was slowly moving. He was gasping. Tony knelt without looking at Pepper, pulling his helmet back and saying, \u201cHey. Hey kid\u2026kid c\u2019mon wake up we won.\u201d He lightly, as light as he could possibly make it, shook Peter\u2019s right shoulder.</p><p>The boy gasped and his eyes shot open before closing again, a cringe painting his face as he let out a hiss. Tony held his shoulder, whispering, \u201cBreathe, okay? Slow and steady\u2026\u201d He opened his eyes again as Steve finally joined the scene, alongside Clint and Thor. The original Avengers, all minus\u2026</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Peter whispered, barely moving his body other than his eyes and mouth. \u201cI\u2026I tried to\u2026bring everyone back. E-Everyone\u2026\u201d He let out another hiss of pain as his hand clutched in on itself, as if he were testing his limits. </p><p>Pepper backed up as Steve knelt next to him, patting him gently on his shoulder. \u201cYou did good Queens.\u201d He said, making Peter\u2019s lip twitch up into a smile.</p><p>\u201cW-Wow\u2026tha\u2026thanks C-Cap\u2019n.\u201d He let out a little chuckle before grimacing, whispering, \u201cWait until\u2026I tell\u2026e\u2019eryone\u2026\u201d His head rolled to the side as his eyes started to close, his breathing slowing.</p><p>Tony jumped into action, unwilling to listen to that stupid part of reason in his brain. \u201cNo no kid, no sleeping on us, okay?\u201d He tapped the uncharred cheek lightly, bringing the kid\u2019s eyes back open. Tony looked at Steve and said, \u201cC\u2019mon, we gotta get him into the Compound. We can go congratulations and good jobs after he\u2019s all healed up. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He moved to put his arms under one leg and his shoulders when he felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Doctor Strange was there, looking down at him sadly. He blinked slowly and just held up a single finger.</p><p>One. One in 14 million and whatever chances they had at winning\u2026this was the reality that they won. The reality in which Peter gave a sacrifice to stop Thanos.</p><p>The reality in which Peter Parker would die.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that one shit.\u201d Tony snapped, shoving his hands under Peter\u2019s slowly unmoving frame. \u201cWe still have time. He still has time. I won\u2019t let your magic mumbo-jumbo stop me from-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Tony looked up at Pepper, whose eyes were starting to well with tears. She knelt at Peter\u2019s feet, reaching over and grabbing his arm. \u201cHe needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes blinked back tears as he looked away from his wife to the kid he considered his son. He was barely breathing, his eyes fluttering and forcing to stay open. All because Tony said to stay awake. Pepper squeezed his forearm and he could barely hear her whisper over his pounding heart, \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her again before back to the kid. The boy he saw on YouTube stopping a whole truck from crashing into a bus one day and trying to pull together a halved boat the next. The friendly kid he knew loved to save and protect far past his neighborhood. The Spider-Man he helped shape into one hell of a hero.</p><p>Anthony Stark held Peter Parker\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cHey\u2026hey kid\u2026\u201d Once the teen looked at him he smiled, holding his hand tighter and letting the tears fall freely. All this was for him. All of it. \u201cYou can sleep now, okay? We\u2019re gonna be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB\u2026Bu\u2026But New York\u2026\u201d He whimpered out, his breathing and voice withering out on him as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for it.\u201d Steven said, patting the boy on the shoulder again.</p><p>Tony looked at Steve in shock. The two shared a glance and Tony mouthed \u201cThank you,\u201d something solitary between only them. Steve nodded and Tony looked back at his kid.</p><p>\u201cThe Cap\u2019s got it, kid\u2026go ahead and rest\u2026You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d Tony smiled as tightly as he could, the tears washing down his cheeks and hitting the boy on the chest. Peter blinked once, twice, before closing his eyes and rolling his head.</p><p>There were three more breaths before Peter Parker, Spider-Man, had died.</p><p>1 Year Later</p><p>The air was cold staring up at the statue. The flowers brought a week ago were withered, he would need to ask F.R.I.D.A.Y. to schedule a cleaning soon.</p><p>After the day everything was fixed life returned to normal for everyone who was in the Soul Stone. Schools resumed, work started off again, and everything was relatively better. Those who were left behind after the Snap had to adjust but, since that day, things have gotten better. Of course, that was all for everyone who was a normal person.</p><p>Tony Stark wasn\u2019t a normal person.</p><p>The second the day after started he set funeral arrangements. He had to call Aunt May, who was almost as hysterical as he was, to get all the details right. His favorite colors, the music he liked, anything and everything needed to show the world their hero.</p><p>The third day he released the information to the world about what happened between the Avengers and Thanos. He told the story about how Spider-Man saved more than just his friendly neighborhood.</p><p>The fourth day he went home and hugged Morgan extra hard and kissed her head.</p><p>The fifth day the funeral for Spider-Man was held. Everyone was there. All the Avengers who had lived, had been Snapped, and had been brought back. The people who wanted to recognize the hero that save their world. Across the globe, that day, everyone mourned the loss of Spider-Man, while those closest mourned the loss of Peter Parker.</p><p>The sixth day everything was back to normal. There were few people who talked about the youngest Avenger and what he sacrificed. Everyone wanted to move on. Everyone wanted to forget. Everyone but Tony.</p><p>So, he built. He built his tears, his memories, his hopes, and his frustration into the standing monument for the fallen. It took him forever. Never using machines, only using his hands and what he could get. Only when he had to fly up high did he use his suit, but never for anything else.</p><p>Only a month ago did he finish the monument to Spider-Man. And now, staring up at it, he could still feel that tight knot of pain.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d A soft voice said. Tony looked behind him and saw a young man there. He had dark brown hair, chocolate eyes, soft freckles on his cheeks, and a scruffy beard. He stood just around Tony\u2019s height, maybe an inch or two taller. He wore a grey dress jacket, pressed red shirt, and black dress pants. The man wasn\u2019t looking at Tony, rather\u2026he was looking up at Peter.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Tony asked, though his first question was how the hell he had gotten past the gates to get to the Compound in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked back at Tony and said, \u201cI was wondering\u2026you wouldn\u2019t happen to have known Spider-Man, would you?\u201d The question was a bit jarring, but Tony nodded. \u201cHow close were you two?\u201d</p><p>Now that question threw him for a loop. It had been a while since he thought of what their relationship was like. Hell, even at the end Tony never really knew. He had a gut feeling to protect and care for Peter, like he had the second Morgan was born\u2026\u201dHe was like a son to me.\u201d Tony whispered, though not fully knowing it until he looked at the man again and seeing him smile.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He said before walking to stand beside him, staring up at the statue. Tony\u2019s confusion only grew as he looked at the man, getting a sense of familiarity that didn\u2019t strike him too hard. \u201cCan you tell me about him?\u201d The man asked, looking up at the statue and never deterring from his stare.</p><p>Tony smiled a bit, feeling like a knot that was tied in him was being let loose. \u201cYou know, after all this time no one has ever asked me that.\u201d The two looked at one another and Tony extended a hand. \u201cTony Stark.\u201d</p><p>The man took his hand in a firm grip, smiling wide as his cheeks look newly tear-stained. \u201cBenjamin Parker.\u201d </p><p>The two then shared stories about Peter Parker into the night, relishing in one another\u2019s company as both found peace in a man who lost a son.</p></p>",

The rational and sane part of him told him to get his lazy ass up and fight for Morgan. For Pepper. For the kid. Tony struggled to stand against the rubble, feeling worse than he had back on the moon Titan. Compared to being smashed by a literal moon and being exploded then beaten up\u2026he felt he needed a new retirement. He finally stood up and took to aim his blaster before jarring himself to a stop.</p><p>The kid had come back. Spider-Man landed on the raised hand and pulled at it with his strength, his feet digging into Thanos\u2019 bicep as his back arched and his face scrunched to pull at the gauntlet one last time. The Mad Titan shook his arm, winding it around, as if swatting at an actual spider. Tony felt the power within him rise as his own protege was holding tightly onto the gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cKid!\u201d He yelled, standing up again and aiming. His blasters didn\u2019t have a lot of power left-his suit was too damaged to hold charge-so he had one last shot. He eyed it, aiming for the monster\u2019s head and firing off as the power sent his weakened state leaning back against the rubble.</p><p>In one quick whip, however, Thanos pulled the kid up like a small shield and Tony watched in horror as his own blast hit the back of the teenage superhero. He didn\u2019t cry out, he didn\u2019t scream\u2026rather, his body reacted with a tightening of his muscles and an arching of his back before Thanos whipped him around and threw him into the rubble far from Tony.</p><p>\u201cPETE!\u201d He screamed out, watching the body of the small spiderling slam into the rubble and fall onto the ground with no noise.

Pepper squeezed his forearm and he could barely hear her whisper over his pounding heart, \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her again before back to the kid. The boy he saw on YouTube stopping a whole truck from crashing into a bus one day and trying to pull together a halved boat the next.

And now, staring up at it, he could still feel that tight knot of pain.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d A soft voice said. Tony looked behind him and saw a young man there. He had dark brown hair, chocolate eyes, soft freckles on his cheeks, and a scruffy beard. He stood just around Tony\u2019s height, maybe an inch or two taller. He wore a grey dress jacket, pressed red shirt, and black dress pants. The man wasn\u2019t looking at Tony, rather\u2026he was looking up at Peter.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Tony asked, though his first question was how the hell he had gotten past the gates to get to the Compound in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked back at Tony and said, \u201cI was wondering\u2026you wouldn\u2019t happen to have known Spider-Man, would you?\u201d The question was a bit jarring, but Tony nodded. \u201cHow close were you two?\u201d</p><p>Now that question threw him for a loop.

Tony\u2019s confusion only grew as he looked at the man, getting a sense of familiarity that didn\u2019t strike him too hard. \u201cCan you tell me about him?\u201d The man asked, looking up at the statue and never deterring from his stare.</p><p>Tony smiled a bit, feeling like a knot that was tied in him was being let loose. \u201cYou know, after all this time no one has ever asked me that.\u201d The two looked at one another and Tony extended a hand. \u201cTony Stark.\u201d</p><p>The man took his hand in a firm grip, smiling wide as his cheeks look newly tear-stained. \u201cBenjamin Parker.\u201d </p><p>The two then shared stories about Peter Parker into the night, relishing in one another\u2019s company as both found peace in a man who lost a son.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>And I&hellip;Am Spider-Man</h1><p>A part of him was screaming to lay there and accept the new world. The rational and sane part of him told him to get his lazy ass up and fight for Morgan. For Pepper. For the kid. Tony struggled to stand against the rubble, feeling worse than he had back on the moon Titan. Compared to being smashed by a literal moon and being exploded then beaten up&hellip;he felt he needed a new retirement. He finally stood up and took to aim his blaster before jarring himself to a stop.</p><p>The kid had come back. Spider-Man landed on the raised hand and pulled at it with his strength, his feet digging into Thanos&rsquo; bicep as his back arched and his face scrunched to pull at the gauntlet one last time. The Mad Titan shook his arm, winding it around, as if swatting at an actual spider. Tony felt the power within him rise as his own protege was holding tightly onto the gauntlet. </p><p>&ldquo;Kid!&rdquo; He yelled, standing up again and aiming. His blasters didn&rsquo;t have a lot of power left-his suit was too damaged to hold charge-so he had one last shot. He eyed it, aiming for the monster&rsquo;s head and firing off as the power sent his weakened state leaning back against the rubble.</p><p>In one quick whip, however, Thanos pulled the kid up like a small shield and Tony watched in horror as his own blast hit the back of the teenage superhero. He didn&rsquo;t cry out, he didn&rsquo;t scream&hellip;rather, his body reacted with a tightening of his muscles and an arching of his back before Thanos whipped him around and threw him into the rubble far from Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;PETE!&rdquo; He screamed out, watching the body of the small spiderling slam into the rubble and fall onto the ground with no noise. He no longer moved, but Tony watched as some of him started&hellip;sparkling? Was it actual sparks from the hit? Was his body smoking? He had no time to think, as Thanos&rsquo; laughter echoed and Tony stared at him with the most anger he felt since that day back on Titan.</p><p>&ldquo;A valiant effort from the small one.&rdquo; He stated, raising the gauntlet again and pressing his middle and thumb together as time start to slow down. &ldquo;But no matter what any of you do&hellip;I am inevitable.&rdquo;</p><p>The world was silent if only for the metal *thunk* and scrapping the two fingers made as they clicked.</p><p>The fighting was still going on, the only audience was Tony and Thanos to the failed attempt. Thanos look at the gauntlet and snapped it again. And again. The same sound going off both times before he stared in horror and Tony felt the same rising to his throat. Before Thanos looked, Tony turned to the now standing Spider-Man.</p><p>He was leaning against the rubble, his legs shaking as he stood and his left arm holding up what looked like an oddly-bent but glowing right hand. His fist was tightly clenched as it shook and his teeth were grinding together as he stared with pure hated in his deep brown eyes. </p><p>His fits glowed with rainbow powers as it flowed through him, while five familiar stones sat planted within his suit&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>Thanos finally took notice of the barely-standing teenager. He glared at him and slowly started stalking towards him. Tony&rsquo;s heart raced, and he swore he felt it hammering against the nanotech that made his own suit. Tony stared in fear and said, &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. how much power is left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About 4% sir,&rdquo; The cocky woman&rsquo;s voice echoed.</p><p>A swore slipped his lips before he started staggering over to Peter. The boy-gosh, was he really that young? Young enough to fight a titan on a random moon and still complain about finals?-he took two steps before falling onto his chest. He felt too weak, his suit was too weak. The stabilizers he had implanted after Rhodey&rsquo;s fall weren&rsquo;t charged enough to keep him standing. He groaned and pushed himself, looking over at Peter and staring there.</p><p>He was looking right back. And as Thanos approached, Peter put his fingers together as if ready to&hellip;&rdquo;Peter NO!&rdquo; Tony screamed, tears welling in his eyes. No. Nononononononono. This isn&rsquo;t what was supposed to happen. Not him. Not again&hellip;!</p><p>He vaguely saw Peter&rsquo;s mouth move and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; before there was a blast of light followed by a click.</p><p>When the light faded, Tony opened his eyes and all he saw was green. Green grass, green leaves, birds chirped in his ears. He looked around and watched as the army faded into dust that crumbled all around the extremely confused Avengers. The Compound was back, completely intact, as if nothing was ever wrong. Within the Compound Tony could barely make out the figure of&hellip;red and green, with a yellow cape&hellip;</p><p>Vision stood there, fading through the glass to go towards them. No Mind Stone in his forehead, but still there. Wanda crumbled to the ground and cried, watching him come back and land next to her. The two embraced and Tony&rsquo;s mind whirred in confusion and shock. What happened? How was Vision back? And where was&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; He looked up. The formerly battered Steve Rogers was now standing above him, perfect like always. As a matter of fact, not a single bruise or cut was on him and his suit and shield were completely intact. Tony moved slowly, his brain ready for the pain but his body moving fluidly without a single groan from his mouth. He felt like a new man. One who was never stuck in that cave back in the desert, who never fell through a space hole, one who never even stubbed his toe! He looked up at Steve, who kept a hand offered to help him up. Tony took it, slowly standing up and looking around.</p><p>The Avengers, the people of Wakanda, everyone&hellip;they were here. They were all okay. Thor was wielding Mjolnir and Stormbreaker, while Steve also had one of the lightning hammers in his hand. Rhodey was bending around, talking about how his legs and back don&rsquo;t hurt to Sam and a highly confused Bucky who was now holding his metal arm in his human left hand. Vision and Wanda were embracing when a gust of wind blew hard and beside them stood Quicksilver. Wanda gasped out and hugged him too, crying hard before pulling Vision into the three-person hug.</p><p>&ldquo;You did it.&rdquo; Steve said, looking around in as much shock as Tony was. The two looked at each other before Steve looked at his hand. He saw it empty, as if expecting him to be the one wielding the stones.</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me.&rdquo; Tony nearly whispered, his throat closing up as he finally turned and saw Pepper landing in her blue suit next to a fallen body of red and blue. Tony was quick to fly over with his re-charged suit and Steve ran over quickly.</p><p>Tony landed to see Pepper turn over Peter, who was looking a little worse for ware. His entire right half from his face to his hip was charred, as if he had been burned alive by that light blast. His eyes were closed but his chest was slowly moving. He was gasping. Tony knelt without looking at Pepper, pulling his helmet back and saying, &ldquo;Hey. Hey kid&hellip;kid c&rsquo;mon wake up we won.&rdquo; He lightly, as light as he could possibly make it, shook Peter&rsquo;s right shoulder.</p><p>The boy gasped and his eyes shot open before closing again, a cringe painting his face as he let out a hiss. Tony held his shoulder, whispering, &ldquo;Breathe, okay? Slow and steady&hellip;&rdquo; He opened his eyes again as Steve finally joined the scene, alongside Clint and Thor. The original Avengers, all minus&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Peter whispered, barely moving his body other than his eyes and mouth. &ldquo;I&hellip;I tried to&hellip;bring everyone back. E-Everyone&hellip;&rdquo; He let out another hiss of pain as his hand clutched in on itself, as if he were testing his limits. </p><p>Pepper backed up as Steve knelt next to him, patting him gently on his shoulder. &ldquo;You did good Queens.&rdquo; He said, making Peter&rsquo;s lip twitch up into a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;W-Wow&hellip;tha&hellip;thanks C-Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo; He let out a little chuckle before grimacing, whispering, &ldquo;Wait until&hellip;I tell&hellip;e&rsquo;eryone&hellip;&rdquo; His head rolled to the side as his eyes started to close, his breathing slowing.</p><p>Tony jumped into action, unwilling to listen to that stupid part of reason in his brain. &ldquo;No no kid, no sleeping on us, okay?&rdquo; He tapped the uncharred cheek lightly, bringing the kid&rsquo;s eyes back open. Tony looked at Steve and said, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, we gotta get him into the Compound. We can go congratulations and good jobs after he&rsquo;s all healed up. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He moved to put his arms under one leg and his shoulders when he felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Doctor Strange was there, looking down at him sadly. He blinked slowly and just held up a single finger.</p><p>One. One in 14 million and whatever chances they had at winning&hellip;this was the reality that they won. The reality in which Peter gave a sacrifice to stop Thanos.</p><p>The reality in which Peter Parker would die.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that one shit.&rdquo; Tony snapped, shoving his hands under Peter&rsquo;s slowly unmoving frame. &ldquo;We still have time. He still has time. I won&rsquo;t let your magic mumbo-jumbo stop me from-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; Tony looked up at Pepper, whose eyes were starting to well with tears. She knelt at Peter&rsquo;s feet, reaching over and grabbing his arm. &ldquo;He needs to rest.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes blinked back tears as he looked away from his wife to the kid he considered his son. He was barely breathing, his eyes fluttering and forcing to stay open. All because Tony said to stay awake. Pepper squeezed his forearm and he could barely hear her whisper over his pounding heart, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at her again before back to the kid.

It was almost as if Tony were really there, but he wasn\u2019t. He was gone and you still couldn\u2019t believe it. You were in shock over the whole thing and in complete denial. He couldn\u2019t be gone. He was Tony Stark&hellip;Iron Man. Nothing could defeat Iron Man.</p><p>You and Tony had been very close. He had raised you when the untimely passing of your parents occurred. He had always been there for you and made sure that you were well taken care of. You looked up to your older brother so much. You grew up and decided to follow in his foot steps by working for his company then by becoming an Avenger, much to his dismay. He was worried about you and your safety, which caused a bit of a rift between you two. He eventually accepted it, however. You two were an amazing team together. You had your ups and downs, but you were family. He was the only family you had left and he was gone. Morgan and Pepper were your family of course, but you and Tony had been through so much together.</p><p>You and the rest of the team had suffered two major losses during this battle. Natasha was the first one to sacrifice herself. It came as a complete shock. You were absolutely devastated. Natasha was your best friend and she was just gone. You didn\u2019t think it could get any worse, but then the battle against Thanos and his minions occurred. Tony was the next one to sacrifice himself.</p><p>You held Morgan\u2019s little hand in yours as you all watched Tony. Your fianc\u00e9e, Steve, was stood right behind you. His hand was on your shoulder and he squeezed it in a comforting manner.</p><p>\u201cI love you, 3000,\u201d Tony spoke before he signed off. His Iron Man helmet stopped playing the hologram and you all sat there quietly for a bit.</p><p>\u201cI love you, 3000, daddy,\u201d Morgan said, which tore at your heart strings.</p><p>You looked down at her as she moved closer into Pepper\u2019s side. Pepper wrapped her arm around her and kissed her head before she looked over at you. You gave her a small smile to try to comfort her. You had been trying to stay strong for Pepper and Morgan. They needed you and you were going to make sure you were strong for them. You\u2019d cried on the battlefield when you watched your brother take his last breath as he looked at you and Pepper. You vowed to stay strong after that.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Y/N?\u201d Pepper asked you and you nodded at her.</p><p>You took one of Morgan\u2019s hands as Pepper took her other. Happy handed Pepper the wreath that was made for his memorial, which was why everyone was together. The wreath had his arc reactor on it that Pepper gifted him that read, \u201cProof that Tony Stark has a heart.\u201d </p><p>Everyone started gathering outside. You, Morgan, and Pepper all walked out to the ramp of the lake hand-in-hand. Steve stayed close behind you. He had been there for you through the whole thing, never leaving your side. He was worried about you, especially since you didn\u2019t seem to be letting yourself grieve properly. He could tell you were holding it all in and knew how dangerous that could be. He let you do your thing, however, and made sure he was there in case you needed him.</p><p>You, Morgan, and Pepper all bent down, placing the wreath into the lake together. You watched it float away as you squeezed Morgan\u2019s hand in yours before she wrapped both of her arms around Pepper. It was like watching that arc reactor float away made it sink in fully. Your brother was gone. He wasn\u2019t there for you to talk to anymore. He wasn\u2019t there to give you advice anymore. He wasn\u2019t there for you to annoy each other. He was <i>really </i>gone. </p><p>As some time passed, you felt your chest tightening up as you watched the wreath float in the water. You tried to make the feeling pass, but it only became stronger as if it were damanding to be noticed. You stood from your spot on the ramp and tried to keep your breathing steady.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ll be back,\u201d you spoke shakily to Pepper before you quickly turned and started walking away.</p><p>You started passing by everyone. Happy watched you walk away with a worried look and Peter Parker looked at you sadly as if he knew what was happening. He also knew that you had been holding in your grief. The boy was close to you and your brother both, but especially to your brother.</p><p>You finally made it into the house and ran up the stairs quickly. You made it into the guest room, where you and Steve had been staying, and shut the door behind you before you leaned back against it. You couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer so you let it out. You began sobbing uncontrollably as your chest tightened up. It felt like something heavy was on it and really there was. Your grief was weighing heavily on you and could no longer be ignored. It demanded to be recognized.</p><p>You tried breathing as you sobbed, but found it hard to. You knew that you were dealing with a panic attack at this point. It was something that you and your brother both suffered from. You would usually help each other in these situations, but he was no longer there to do that.</p><p>There was a knock on the door and you put your hand to your mouth to try to keep your sobs down.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Steve spoke from behind the door. \u201cCan I come in, doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you sobbed out as you pushed yourself off of the door and opened it.</p><p>Steve looked at you and came into the room quickly when he saw the state you were in. He shut the door behind him before he gathered you into his arms and held you against him.</p><p>\u201cSt-Steve, he\u2019s g-gone,\u201d you sobbed out. \u201cM-my b-brother\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he sighed out sadly as he rubbed your back and placed his lips on top of your head.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t br-breathe,\u201d you choked out.</p><p>Steve picked you up and carried you over to the bed. He sat down on it and placed you in his lap before he pulled away a bit so that he could look at you. His hands came up and held your face as your own hands held tightly to his wrists.</p><p>\u201cY/N, doll, look at me,\u201d he told you. \u201cLook at me, sweetheart. Just focus those pretty eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>You were looking around in a panic, but your eyes eventually landed on his and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said as he wiped away the never ending tears. \u201cJust focus on me, okay?\u201d He moved one of his hands and took one of yours, placing it on his chest where his heart was. \u201cFocus on the beating of my heart and my breathing and try to follow it.\u201d</p><p>You felt the beating of his heart beneath your hand, steady and strong. You could also feel his chest rise and fall with each breath he took. He took some deep breaths and let them out slowly to show you how to breathe. You tried to put all of your attention on him. You closed your eyes so you could focus more and began trying to take some calming breaths.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, sweetheart,\u201d he said, encouraging you. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so good. Just keep doing that for me.\u201d</p><p>You did as he told you. You matched your breathing with his and found yourself starting to calm down. The tears still came, but the panicky feeling was starting to evaporate from you. It took some time, but you eventually calmed down enough to breathe properly again.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Steve said and squeezed your hand in his before he brought it to his lips and kissed it.</p><p>You finally opened your eyes and looked at Steve, who was looking right back at you. He looked worried, but was keeping his cool for you.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been there for him, Steve,\u201d you told him.</p><p>\u201cYou were there for him, doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-I mean I should\u2019ve been there to stop him,\u201d you told him. \u201cTo save him! I should\u2019ve been the one to use the stones!\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s face fell at that and he shook his head quickly. \u201cY/N&hellip;no. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d You told him. \u201cTony\u2019s always been there for me and I should\u2019ve been there for him! He finally had everything he wanted and deserved&hellip;Pepper and Morgan. They need him. Morgan needs her father and Pepper needs her husband, Steve. It should\u2019ve been me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, you know good and well that Tony would\u2019ve done everything he could to keep you from sacrificing yourself,\u201d he told you. \u201cYou\u2019re his sister and he loved you so much. There\u2019s absolutely nothing you could\u2019ve done to stop him so don\u2019t blame yourself for any of this. He wouldn\u2019t want you to. He did what he did for his family&hellip;for you. He was important, but <i>you\u2019re </i>important too. I love you, Y/N, and I need you. Your loved by so many. The world needs Y/N Stark so don\u2019t ever say that it should\u2019ve been you.\u201d</p><p>You knew Steve was right about your brother not letting you sacrifice yourself. Tony would\u2019ve chose the same path to keep you all safe. It just hurt you too much. Why did it all have to play out like this? Why did Natasha and Tony have to sacrifice themselves? They didn\u2019t deserve it. You all should be together. They did what they had to to save the world, but they deserved so much better.</p><p>Steve kissed your forehead before he pulled you close. You buried your face in his chest as you continued crying. You were probably making a mess of his shirt, but neither of you cared. He rubbed your back as you let it all out, whispering comforting words to you.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s not going to be here to watch us get married or to walk me down the aisle,\u201d you said aloud after a while. It hurt to think about, but it weighed heavy on you. \u201cNatasha won\u2019t be here either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be there, doll,\u201d Steve said and kissed your head. \u201cHe may not be there physically, but I know he\u2019ll be there in spirit. He\u2019ll probably be glaring daggers into me because I\u2019m marrying his baby sister. Natasha will be there too.\u201d</p><p>You smiled a little at that as you raised up to look at Steve. His eyes were watering as if he were holding back his own tears, but one fell. He wiped your tears away again and pecked your lips before you wiped his tear away in return.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Y/N,\u201d he told you and rest his forehead on yours.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Steve,\u201d you told him. \u201cThank you for being here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be here for you, doll,\u201d he told you.</p>",

Tony was the next one to sacrifice himself.</p><p>You held Morgan\u2019s little hand in yours as you all watched Tony. Your fianc\u00e9e, Steve, was stood right behind you. His hand was on your shoulder and he squeezed it in a comforting manner.</p><p>\u201cI love you, 3000,\u201d Tony spoke before he signed off. His Iron Man helmet stopped playing the hologram and you all sat there quietly for a bit.</p><p>\u201cI love you, 3000, daddy,\u201d Morgan said, which tore at your heart strings.</p><p>You looked down at her as she moved closer into Pepper\u2019s side. Pepper wrapped her arm around her and kissed her head before she looked over at you. You gave her a small smile to try to comfort her. You had been trying to stay strong for Pepper and Morgan. They needed you and you were going to make sure you were strong for them. You\u2019d cried on the battlefield when you watched your brother take his last breath as he looked at you and Pepper. You vowed to stay strong after that.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Y/N?\u201d Pepper asked you and you nodded at her.</p><p>You took one of Morgan\u2019s hands as Pepper took her other. Happy handed Pepper the wreath that was made for his memorial, which was why everyone was together. The wreath had his arc reactor on it that Pepper gifted him that read, \u201cProof that Tony Stark has a heart.\u201d </p><p>Everyone started gathering outside. You, Morgan, and Pepper all walked out to the ramp of the lake hand-in-hand. Steve stayed close behind you. He had been there for you through the whole thing, never leaving your side. He was worried about you, especially since you didn\u2019t seem to be letting yourself grieve properly. He could tell you were holding it all in and knew how dangerous that could be. He let you do your thing, however, and made sure he was there in case you needed him.</p><p>You, Morgan, and Pepper all bent down, placing the wreath into the lake together. You watched it float away as you squeezed Morgan\u2019s hand in yours before she wrapped both of her arms around Pepper. It was like watching that arc reactor float away made it sink in fully. Your brother was gone. He wasn\u2019t there for you to talk to anymore. He wasn\u2019t there to give you advice anymore. He wasn\u2019t there for you to annoy each other. He was <i>really </i>gone. </p><p>As some time passed, you felt your chest tightening up as you watched the wreath float in the water. You tried to make the feeling pass, but it only became stronger as if it were damanding to be noticed. You stood from your spot on the ramp and tried to keep your breathing steady.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ll be back,\u201d you spoke shakily to Pepper before you quickly turned and started walking away.</p><p>You started passing by everyone. Happy watched you walk away with a worried look and Peter Parker looked at you sadly as if he knew what was happening. He also knew that you had been holding in your grief. The boy was close to you and your brother both, but especially to your brother.</p><p>You finally made it into the house and ran up the stairs quickly. You made it into the guest room, where you and Steve had been staying, and shut the door behind you before you leaned back against it. You couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer so you let it out. You began sobbing uncontrollably as your chest tightened up. It felt like something heavy was on it and really there was. Your grief was weighing heavily on you and could no longer be ignored. It demanded to be recognized.</p><p>You tried breathing as you sobbed, but found it hard to. You knew that you were dealing with a panic attack at this point. It was something that you and your brother both suffered from. You would usually help each other in these situations, but he was no longer there to do that.</p><p>There was a knock on the door and you put your hand to your mouth to try to keep your sobs down.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Steve spoke from behind the door. \u201cCan I come in, doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you sobbed out as you pushed yourself off of the door and opened it.</p><p>Steve looked at you and came into the room quickly when he saw the state you were in. He shut the door behind him before he gathered you into his arms and held you against him.</p><p>\u201cSt-Steve, he\u2019s g-gone,\u201d you sobbed out. \u201cM-my b-brother\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he sighed out sadly as he rubbed your back and placed his lips on top of your head.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t br-breathe,\u201d you choked out.</p><p>Steve picked you up and carried you over to the bed. He sat down on it and placed you in his lap before he pulled away a bit so that he could look at you. His hands came up and held your face as your own hands held tightly to his wrists.</p><p>\u201cY/N, doll, look at me,\u201d he told you. \u201cLook at me, sweetheart. Just focus those pretty eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>You were looking around in a panic, but your eyes eventually landed on his and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said as he wiped away the never ending tears. \u201cJust focus on me, okay?\u201d He moved one of his hands and took one of yours, placing it on his chest where his heart was. \u201cFocus on the beating of my heart and my breathing and try to follow it.\u201d</p><p>You felt the beating of his heart beneath your hand, steady and strong. You could also feel his chest rise and fall with each breath he took. He took some deep breaths and let them out slowly to show you how to breathe. You tried to put all of your attention on him. You closed your eyes so you could focus more and began trying to take some calming breaths.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, sweetheart,\u201d he said, encouraging you. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so good. Just keep doing that for me.\u201d</p><p>You did as he told you. You matched your breathing with his and found yourself starting to calm down. The tears still came, but the panicky feeling was starting to evaporate from you. It took some time, but you eventually calmed down enough to breathe properly again.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Steve said and squeezed your hand in his before he brought it to his lips and kissed it.</p><p>You finally opened your eyes and looked at Steve, who was looking right back at you. He looked worried, but was keeping his cool for you.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been there for him, Steve,\u201d you told him.</p><p>\u201cYou were there for him, doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-I mean I should\u2019ve been there to stop him,\u201d you told him. \u201cTo save him! I should\u2019ve been the one to use the stones!\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s face fell at that and he shook his head quickly. \u201cY/N\u2026no. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d You told him. \u201cTony\u2019s always been there for me and I should\u2019ve been there for him! He finally had everything he wanted and deserved\u2026Pepper and Morgan. They need him. Morgan needs her father and Pepper needs her husband, Steve. It should\u2019ve been me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, you know good and well that Tony would\u2019ve done everything he could to keep you from sacrificing yourself,\u201d he told you. \u201cYou\u2019re his sister and he loved you so much. There\u2019s absolutely nothing you could\u2019ve done to stop him so don\u2019t blame yourself for any of this. He wouldn\u2019t want you to. He did what he did for his family\u2026for you. He was important, but <i>you\u2019re </i>important too. I love you, Y/N, and I need you. Your loved by so many. The world needs Y/N Stark so don\u2019t ever say that it should\u2019ve been you.\u201d</p><p>You knew Steve was right about your brother not letting you sacrifice yourself. Tony would\u2019ve chose the same path to keep you all safe. It just hurt you too much. Why did it all have to play out like this? Why did Natasha and Tony have to sacrifice themselves? They didn\u2019t deserve it. You all should be together. They did what they had to to save the world, but they deserved so much better.</p><p>Steve kissed your forehead before he pulled you close. You buried your face in his chest as you continued crying. You were probably making a mess of his shirt, but neither of you cared. He rubbed your back as you let it all out, whispering comforting words to you.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s not going to be here to watch us get married or to walk me down the aisle,\u201d you said aloud after a while. It hurt to think about, but it weighed heavy on you. \u201cNatasha won\u2019t be here either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be there, doll,\u201d Steve said and kissed your head. \u201cHe may not be there physically, but I know he\u2019ll be there in spirit. He\u2019ll probably be glaring daggers into me because I\u2019m marrying his baby sister. Natasha will be there too.\u201d</p><p>You smiled a little at that as you raised up to look at Steve. His eyes were watering as if he were holding back his own tears, but one fell. He wiped your tears away again and pecked your lips before you wiped his tear away in return.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Y/N,\u201d he told you and rest his forehead on yours.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Steve,\u201d you told him. \u201cThank you for being here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be here for you, doll,\u201d he told you.</p></p>",

It was almost as if Tony were really there, but he wasn\u2019t. He was gone and you still couldn\u2019t believe it. You were in shock over the whole thing and in complete denial. He couldn\u2019t be gone. He was Tony Stark\u2026Iron Man. Nothing could defeat Iron Man.</p><p>You and Tony had been very close. He had raised you when the untimely passing of your parents occurred. He had always been there for you and made sure that you were well taken care of. You looked up to your older brother so much. You grew up and decided to follow in his foot steps by working for his company then by becoming an Avenger, much to his dismay. He was worried about you and your safety, which caused a bit of a rift between you two. He eventually accepted it, however. You two were an amazing team together. You had your ups and downs, but you were family. He was the only family you had left and he was gone. Morgan and Pepper were your family of course, but you and Tony had been through so much together.</p><p>You and the rest of the team had suffered two major losses during this battle. Natasha was the first one to sacrifice herself. It came as a complete shock. You were absolutely devastated. Natasha was your best friend and she was just gone. You didn\u2019t think it could get any worse, but then the battle against Thanos and his minions occurred.

It was almost as if Tony were really there, but he wasn&rsquo;t. He was gone and you still couldn&rsquo;t believe it. You were in shock over the whole thing and in complete denial. He couldn&rsquo;t be gone. He was Tony Stark&hellip;Iron Man. Nothing could defeat Iron Man.</p><p>You and Tony had been very close. He had raised you when the untimely passing of your parents occurred. He had always been there for you and made sure that you were well taken care of. You looked up to your older brother so much. You grew up and decided to follow in his foot steps by working for his company then by becoming an Avenger, much to his dismay. He was worried about you and your safety, which caused a bit of a rift between you two. He eventually accepted it, however. You two were an amazing team together. You had your ups and downs, but you were family. He was the only family you had left and he was gone. Morgan and Pepper were your family of course, but you and Tony had been through so much together.</p><p>You and the rest of the team had suffered two major losses during this battle. Natasha was the first one to sacrifice herself. It came as a complete shock. You were absolutely devastated. Natasha was your best friend and she was just gone. You didn&rsquo;t think it could get any worse, but then the battle against Thanos and his minions occurred. Tony was the next one to sacrifice himself.</p><p>You held Morgan&rsquo;s little hand in yours as you all watched Tony. Your fianc&eacute;e, Steve, was stood right behind you. His hand was on your shoulder and he squeezed it in a comforting manner.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, 3000,&rdquo; Tony spoke before he signed off. His Iron Man helmet stopped playing the hologram and you all sat there quietly for a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, 3000, daddy,&rdquo; Morgan said, which tore at your heart strings.</p><p>You looked down at her as she moved closer into Pepper&rsquo;s side. Pepper wrapped her arm around her and kissed her head before she looked over at you. You gave her a small smile to try to comfort her. You had been trying to stay strong for Pepper and Morgan. They needed you and you were going to make sure you were strong for them. You&rsquo;d cried on the battlefield when you watched your brother take his last breath as he looked at you and Pepper. You vowed to stay strong after that.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready, Y/N?&rdquo; Pepper asked you and you nodded at her.</p><p>You took one of Morgan&rsquo;s hands as Pepper took her other. Happy handed Pepper the wreath that was made for his memorial, which was why everyone was together. The wreath had his arc reactor on it that Pepper gifted him that read, &ldquo;Proof that Tony Stark has a heart.&rdquo; </p><p>Everyone started gathering outside. You, Morgan, and Pepper all walked out to the ramp of the lake hand-in-hand. Steve stayed close behind you. He had been there for you through the whole thing, never leaving your side. He was worried about you, especially since you didn&rsquo;t seem to be letting yourself grieve properly. He could tell you were holding it all in and knew how dangerous that could be. He let you do your thing, however, and made sure he was there in case you needed him.</p><p>You, Morgan, and Pepper all bent down, placing the wreath into the lake together. You watched it float away as you squeezed Morgan&rsquo;s hand in yours before she wrapped both of her arms around Pepper. It was like watching that arc reactor float away made it sink in fully. Your brother was gone. He wasn&rsquo;t there for you to talk to anymore. He wasn&rsquo;t there to give you advice anymore. He wasn&rsquo;t there for you to annoy each other. He was <i>really </i>gone. </p><p>As some time passed, you felt your chest tightening up as you watched the wreath float in the water. You tried to make the feeling pass, but it only became stronger as if it were damanding to be noticed. You stood from your spot on the ramp and tried to keep your breathing steady.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; you spoke shakily to Pepper before you quickly turned and started walking away.</p><p>You started passing by everyone. Happy watched you walk away with a worried look and Peter Parker looked at you sadly as if he knew what was happening. He also knew that you had been holding in your grief. The boy was close to you and your brother both, but especially to your brother.</p><p>You finally made it into the house and ran up the stairs quickly. You made it into the guest room, where you and Steve had been staying, and shut the door behind you before you leaned back against it. You couldn&rsquo;t hold it back any longer so you let it out. You began sobbing uncontrollably as your chest tightened up. It felt like something heavy was on it and really there was. Your grief was weighing heavily on you and could no longer be ignored. It demanded to be recognized.</p><p>You tried breathing as you sobbed, but found it hard to. You knew that you were dealing with a panic attack at this point. It was something that you and your brother both suffered from. You would usually help each other in these situations, but he was no longer there to do that.</p><p>There was a knock on the door and you put your hand to your mouth to try to keep your sobs down.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; Steve spoke from behind the door. &ldquo;Can I come in, doll?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; you sobbed out as you pushed yourself off of the door and opened it.</p><p>Steve looked at you and came into the room quickly when he saw the state you were in. He shut the door behind him before he gathered you into his arms and held you against him.</p><p>&ldquo;St-Steve, he&rsquo;s g-gone,&rdquo; you sobbed out. &ldquo;M-my b-brother&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he sighed out sadly as he rubbed your back and placed his lips on top of your head.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t br-breathe,&rdquo; you choked out.</p><p>Steve picked you up and carried you over to the bed. He sat down on it and placed you in his lap before he pulled away a bit so that he could look at you. His hands came up and held your face as your own hands held tightly to his wrists.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, doll, look at me,&rdquo; he told you. &ldquo;Look at me, sweetheart. Just focus those pretty eyes on me.&rdquo;</p><p>You were looking around in a panic, but your eyes eventually landed on his and he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he said as he wiped away the never ending tears. &ldquo;Just focus on me, okay?&rdquo; He moved one of his hands and took one of yours, placing it on his chest where his heart was. &ldquo;Focus on the beating of my heart and my breathing and try to follow it.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt the beating of his heart beneath your hand, steady and strong. You could also feel his chest rise and fall with each breath he took. He took some deep breaths and let them out slowly to show you how to breathe. You tried to put all of your attention on him. You closed your eyes so you could focus more and began trying to take some calming breaths.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sweetheart,&rdquo; he said, encouraging you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing so good. Just keep doing that for me.&rdquo;</p><p>You did as he told you. You matched your breathing with his and found yourself starting to calm down. The tears still came, but the panicky feeling was starting to evaporate from you. It took some time, but you eventually calmed down enough to breathe properly again.</p><p>&ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; Steve said and squeezed your hand in his before he brought it to his lips and kissed it.</p><p>You finally opened your eyes and looked at Steve, who was looking right back at you. He looked worried, but was keeping his cool for you.</p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve been there for him, Steve,&rdquo; you told him.</p><p>&ldquo;You were there for him, doll.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I-I mean I should&rsquo;ve been there to stop him,&rdquo; you told him. &ldquo;To save him! I should&rsquo;ve been the one to use the stones!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s face fell at that and he shook his head quickly. &ldquo;Y/N&hellip;no. Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; You told him. &ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s always been there for me and I should&rsquo;ve been there for him! He finally had everything he wanted and deserved&hellip;Pepper and Morgan. They need him. Morgan needs her father and Pepper needs her husband, Steve. It should&rsquo;ve been me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you know good and well that Tony would&rsquo;ve done everything he could to keep you from sacrificing yourself,&rdquo; he told you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re his sister and he loved you so much. There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing you could&rsquo;ve done to stop him so don&rsquo;t blame yourself for any of this. He wouldn&rsquo;t want you to. He did what he did for his family&hellip;for you. He was important, but <i>you&rsquo;re </i>important too. I love you, Y/N, and I need you. Your loved by so many. The world needs Y/N Stark so don&rsquo;t ever say that it should&rsquo;ve been you.&rdquo;</p><p>You knew Steve was right about your brother not letting you sacrifice yourself. Tony would&rsquo;ve chose the same path to keep you all safe. It just hurt you too much. Why did it all have to play out like this? Why did Natasha and Tony have to sacrifice themselves? They didn&rsquo;t deserve it. You all should be together. They did what they had to to save the world, but they deserved so much better.</p><p>Steve kissed your forehead before he pulled you close. You buried your face in his chest as you continued crying. You were probably making a mess of his shirt, but neither of you cared. He rubbed your back as you let it all out, whispering comforting words to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s not going to be here to watch us get married or to walk me down the aisle,&rdquo; you said aloud after a while. It hurt to think about, but it weighed heavy on you. &ldquo;Natasha won&rsquo;t be here either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be there, doll,&rdquo; Steve said and kissed your head. &ldquo;He may not be there physically, but I know he&rsquo;ll be there in spirit. He&rsquo;ll probably be glaring daggers into me because I&rsquo;m marrying his baby sister. Natasha will be there too.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled a little at that as you raised up to look at Steve. His eyes were watering as if he were holding back his own tears, but one fell. He wiped your tears away again and pecked your lips before you wiped his tear away in return.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, Y/N,&rdquo; he told you and rest his forehead on yours.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Steve,&rdquo; you told him. &ldquo;Thank you for being here for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always be here for you, doll,&rdquo; he told you.</p></p>",
