She didn\u2019t blame him, given that she basically cut him out of her life twice. A well meaning cut out but a cut off nevertheless.

                "content": "<p>Day 28. What are the characters favorite candy?</p><p>Andi - Mystery Flavored Jelly Beans because she never knows what to expect! </p><p>Buffy - Sour Warheads. When they were kids, eating them was a competition of sorts, but now, she actually really likes the flavor, especially since she&rsquo;s used to the sour by now.</p><p>Cyrus - Butterfingers. He told Buffy that he &ldquo;is glad that he found a candy as clumsy as him!&rdquo; </p><p>Jonah - Snickers. Idk if you&rsquo;ve ever seen Jonah when he&rsquo;s hungry, but he&rsquo;s literally like the commercials. It&rsquo;s the only time he&rsquo;s not the happy-go-lucky dofus we all know and love.</p><p>Bowie - Laffy Taffy. He doesn&rsquo;t know why, he&rsquo;s just always had a sweet tooth for them. </p><p>Bex - Andi let her try one of those Airhead Xtremes and she&rsquo;s been hooked ever since. She doesn&rsquo;t know what is in those things (and doesn&rsquo;t want to know), but she is thankful that they exist. </p><p>CeCe - Don&rsquo;t ever tell anyone I told you this, but she&rsquo;s a sucker for Dove Chocolate. She&rsquo;s really more of a dark chocolate gal, though. Ham knows all of this and is sure to buy her some every now and then to surprise her, especially on particularly hard days. The week Andi moved out, it was like a chocolate factory at their house. </p><p>Ham - Abba-Zabbas were his absolute favorite and it is an outrage to him that they were discontinued!  </p><p>Amber - Sour Patch Kids (first they&rsquo;re sour, then they&rsquo;re sweet&hellip;sound familiar?)</p><p>TJ - Baby Ruths. Not only is TJ a basketball stan, he absolutely loves baseball and those candy bars. When he was a kid, his mom used to let him get a pack of baseball cards and a Baby Ruth every time they went to the store. Amber was allowed to get a pack of her favorite candy, Sour Patch Kids, and whatever small you her heart desired that day too. Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell TJ that the company <i>claims</i> to not have any affiliation with the baseball player, but then again, they probably just said that to get out of paying him royalties, so who knows?</p><p>Walker - Mystery Flavored Airheads.
