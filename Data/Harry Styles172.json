        "body": "<p><b><i>A highschool!au set in the 70&rsquo;s. </i></b><br/></p><p><b><i>Word count: 4.2k+</i></b></p><p>(A/N: Hey! So I wrote this with the intention of it being set in 1977, although I don\u2019t think I did a fantastic job of conveying that (I tried ok) so it\u2019s pretty easy to just imagine it however you\u2019d like! ALSO I wrote this both on my laptop and my phone where the spell check/grammar check is different so please excuse any switches between british spelling and american spelling. Please let me know what you think, I\u2019d really appreciate it. Hope you like it!) </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>December 1st, 1977. Tilly&rsquo;s 17th Birthday. It would be like most days if not for the crazy amount of balloons and streamers decorating the living room, where she sits in her pyjamas carefully unwrapping the bow tied around the box in her lap. Tilly&rsquo;s never been one to worry too much over her birthday, her parents however (more specifically her Mother), have always made a fuss over the day despite her constant re-assurance that she&rsquo;s just happy with homemade cupcakes and a new pair of bell bottoms.</p><p>Her parents had woken her up especially early so she could see the decorations and be wished a proper happy birthday before shuffling off to school. Tilly has always appreciated her Mother&rsquo;s efforts when it comes to special occasions and finds it quite comical that her Father agrees with all her decor decisions, despite not caring for the over-the-top-ness of it all.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; A gasp leaves Tilly as she finally opens the lavender colored box, a pair of strappy, short silver heels resting on top of white tissue paper. &ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t mind wearing my white flats.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But I saw how much you loved them when you tried them on in the store.&rdquo; Her Mother says fondly. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t babble on about the price. Your Father was able to talk the manager into a sweet deal.&rdquo; She pats her husbands knee, the two of them perched on the edge of the coffee table with Tilly sat in the comfortable armchair usually reserved for her Father.</p><p>Moving the box to the ground, Tilly stands, embracing her parents in an appreciative hug and a kiss to their cheek each. &ldquo;Thank you, thank you! I can&rsquo;t wait to wear these tonight!&rdquo; She squeals in delight, the thought of her outfit for tonight&rsquo;s winter formal coming together perfectly.</p><p>December marks not only Tilly&rsquo;s birthday, but the start of winter which means her high school&rsquo;s winter formal was only around the corner. Lucky for her, it just so happens to fall on her birthday this year which means she had an excuse to dress up and have fun with her friends. (It also serves as an unofficial birthday party which makes it even better.)</p><p>After a breakfast of waffles and syrup - her favorite breakfast - Tilly takes her time getting ready, choosing to wear her new pair of mid-wash bell bottoms with a soft, cream colored sweater that her Grandma had given her last Christmas.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy Birthday, Tilly!!!!&rdquo; A scream is more or less heard from the kerb as Tilly leaves for school.</p><p>There, leaning out the passenger window of the car, is her best friend Valerie with her super curly locks blowing around in the morning breeze. Tilly skips down the path leading from her front door to the street and quickly embraces Valerie in a tight hug before jumping in the back seat next to her other friends Doug and Bobby.</p><p>She&rsquo;s met with a round of birthday wishes from the two boys and politely thanks them before making eye contact with the driver through the rear view mirror. &ldquo;Happy Birthday.&rdquo; He says in a gruff voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Harry.&rdquo; Tilly hopes he sees her sincere smile through the small mirror as he pulls away from her front kerb and starts the short drive to school.</p><p>Tilly has always had a <i>slight</i> crush Harry. And really, who could blame her? He had grown his hair out so the brown curls just touched the top of his shoulders and for some reason taken more of an interest in her compared to what he used to. But she convinced herself that he would never like her back after over-hearing him tell Bobby that she wasn&rsquo;t his type one day when she showed up earlier than usual to their hang out spot.</p><p>Their little gang of friends formed during the summer going into 9th grade with the five of them bonding over the fear of high school, especially the older kids (seniors are scary when you&rsquo;re a freshman okay?) and new found responsibilities. Tilly had been friends with Valerie the longest, since 5th grade, but she definitely considers the boys her best friends too.</p><p>Harry isn&rsquo;t the most outgoing when compared to Bobby or Doug, who can just about cause a ruckus anywhere they go, but he is arguably the most likeable out of the group. His personality radiates with a level of confidence and charm that people can&rsquo;t help but fall for. Tilly even remembers her parents saying how much of a nice boy Harry was when the gang had dinner at her house for her birthday last year. The two have never really been able to get to know each other on a personal one-on-one level, having to avoid harmless teasing from the rest of their friends, so they only really hang out in group settings.</p><p>The car ride to school is spent listening softly to Queen playing on the radio and Valerie turning around to chat with the three in the back seat. Once at school, Tilly is whisked away by Valerie to the second floor girls restroom where she almost squeals in excitement.</p><p>&ldquo;Val, why are you smiling so much? You&rsquo;re kinda scaring me.&rdquo; Tilly is skeptical, her best friend only usually in this mood when she has some <i>interesting</i> gossip or has a secret that she can&rsquo;t hold in.</p><p>Valerie takes a deep breath, &ldquo;Dean told Maria who told Kayla who told me that Dean&rsquo;s going to ask you to dance and then on a date tonight!&rdquo; She says so fast she struggles to regain her breath for a second afterwards.</p><p>Tilly can&rsquo;t help the shocked smile that finds its way to her face. Dean was the star of the football team, which made him the most popular guy in school and not surprisingly, the boy almost every girl wished they could go out with.</p><p>&ldquo;Far out, Val!&rdquo; Tilly quickly checks who could overhear their private conversation in the bathroom and after finding the coast is clear, she lets out a laugh in disbelief. The most popular boy in school wants to not only dance with her at the winter formal, but ask out?! Tilly couldn&rsquo;t really believe it.</p><p>The school bell shrills and the sound of lockers slamming shut follows as the girls file out of the bathroom and to their first class of the day. Valerie says a quick goodbye to Tilly, the sound of her clogs hitting the floor as she runs to a meeting. Being on the school events committee, she had a whole day of preparation and meetings for the impending winter formal. Luckily though, it was only a half day so students (especially the girls) had enough time to get ready with little complaints.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you all smiley?&rdquo; Harry says as Tilly plops down at the desk beside his.</p><p>Letting the grin fall slightly from her face (she didn&rsquo;t think she was smiling that much but clearly she thought wrong), she shakes her head dismissively. &ldquo;Just a wonderful birthday so far.&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s met with a nod from Harry and the two turn to face their teacher who&rsquo;s stuck-in-the-60&rsquo;s style is in full swing.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry doesn&rsquo;t really like school dances. He wouldn&rsquo;t say he hates them because they really aren&rsquo;t that bad. He just doesn&rsquo;t care for the fuss of it all and honestly, he&rsquo;d rather just hang out with his friends in Doug&rsquo;s garage like usual.</p><p>The three boys are currently sat in said garage-turned hangout spot, a small tv on a table against the wall and a couch with some bean bags strewn around. Bobby&rsquo;s sat on the stool behind the drum set and Harry&rsquo;s sat on the largest of the bean bags (arguably his designated seat) with an acoustic guitar in his grip. Music has always been an important part of Harry&rsquo;s life, his guitar being his most prized possession. It also helps that Bobby plays a little guitar (he&rsquo;s not so great on the drums) so the two often have little jam sessions with Doug either obnoxiously singing along or just reading a comic in the presence of his mates.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are the girls?&rdquo; Doug mumbles from his spot, laying on the couch, with a G-I Joe in his hand. He&rsquo;d never let anyone outside his gang know how much he loves dolls (or action figures as he insists).</p><p>&ldquo;Val&rsquo;s probably still decorating the gym,&rdquo; Bobby answers as he taps the symbols of the drums lightly, &ldquo;Tilly&rsquo;s probably already getting ready for her big night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I heard Dean&rsquo;s gonna get with her tonight.&rdquo; Doug chimes in which causes Harry to suddenly stop his light strumming on the guitar.</p><p>Trying to conceal his shock, he clears his throat before saying, &ldquo;Since when was Dean interested in Tilly?&rdquo; Sitting up higher in the bean bag he adds, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not to the girls he&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; A shrug of Doug&rsquo;s shoulders follows as he places the action figure neatly on the coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;I reckon girls like that, man.&rdquo; Moving from the drums to the couch, Bobby sits himself next to Doug and turns to face Harry. &ldquo;Val told me that she personally likes a guy who&rsquo;s not all over her. She likes a challenge.&rdquo; His eyebrows raise and fall after he sees their skepticism. &ldquo;Why do you think I&rsquo;ve been different around her?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s an unspoken truth that Bobby is in love with Valerie, everybody knows it, maybe even Valerie herself but nothing has come of it yet. Neither have confessed their feelings to the other so the other three have to put up with the back and forth between the two.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy if you think Valerie of all people will fall for your little act.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s tone is harmless, knowing Bobby doesn&rsquo;t mind a little teasing.</p><p>Bobby scoffs, &ldquo;Whatever, man.&rdquo; Earning a laugh from Doug who proceeds to play wrestle with him over the back of the couch.</p><p>That&rsquo;s more or less Harry&rsquo;s cue to leave, not wanting to hurt himself before the dance tonight. (He won&rsquo;t admit it, but he does care how he looks at these events, pretty girls have that effect on him.)</p><p>*</p><p>9pm. The winter formal is in full swing, Valerie running her tiny self around the gym making sure everyone&rsquo;s having a good time and no one spikes the punch bowl, Doug devouring the snacks table and Bobby and Harry hanging next to the bleachers mostly keeping to themselves with the odd teacher attempting at small talk every 20 minutes.</p><p>The only person who&rsquo;s location is unknown, is Tilly&rsquo;s. Harry had briefly seen her chatting to some girls from the drama club when he arrived over an hour ago but hasn&rsquo;t seen her since. Plus, the gym is pretty huge and he&rsquo;s pretty sure the entire school is at this dance so he&rsquo;s surprised he hasn&rsquo;t even lost Bobby yet. (Doug never strays more than 20 feet from the refreshments table at school dances so no one really worries about him wandering off.)</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a really great job with this whole thing, Val.&rdquo; Bobby says bashfully as Valerie approaches them with a slight look of exhaustion on her face. &ldquo;And you look amazing.&rdquo; He adds for good measure, earning a slap on the back from Harry.</p><p>Valerie smiles warmly, &ldquo;Thanks, Bobby.&rdquo; Pulling him in for a hug, Harry&rsquo;s sure he heard Bobby&rsquo;s heart stop beating for a few seconds, this being the most affection she has ever shown to her not-so-secret admirer in the few years they&rsquo;ve been friends.</p><p>It makes Harry happy, seeing his best friend get a little something from his crush even if it was as tiny as something like a hug.</p><p>When a slow and melodious song starts playing through the speakers, Valerie gasps, pulling Bobby&rsquo;s hand into her own, &ldquo;Dance with me?&rdquo;</p><p>Once again, Harry swears he hears Bobby&rsquo;s heart convulse but before the two can get away from him and onto the dance floor he stops Valerie.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen Tilly?&rdquo; He tries not to give off a worried tone, but Tilly is his friend and he can&rsquo;t help but be a little worried that he hasn&rsquo;t spoken to her at all this evening. And it&rsquo;s her birthday after all so he wants to know she&rsquo;s having a good time.</p><p>&ldquo;No, last I saw she was talking to Ms. Davis. But if you see her tell her I&rsquo;m looking for her!&rdquo; And with that she whisks Bobby away and into the crowd of teenagers who even during a slow song, try to grind up on each other.</p><p>Harry spots Ms. Davis by the entrance to the gym, &ldquo;Oh, young Harry Styles how are finding this years winter formal? The committee did a wonderful job don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; The teacher in her mid-60&rsquo;s speaks in a way that Harry can only describe as old-lady-like.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s pretty cool,&rdquo; his answer is somewhat sincere, &ldquo;Have you seen Tilly around?&rdquo;</p><p>Ms. Davis ponders for a moment, &ldquo;Oh yes, I did see her leave a few minutes ago and she looked a little upset.&rdquo; Harry won&rsquo;t admit it out loud but he does feel a sense of despair hearing those words.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Ms. Davis.&rdquo; A curt nod and tight lipped smile is all Harry gives before making his way out of the gym, down the halls of the school and out through the front doors.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t immediately see Tilly so he decides to basically walk the perimeter of the school building, hoping to find a not-so-sad birthday girl. It takes him a few minutes but eventually he spots her sitting on the third step of the bleachers by the football field. Truthfully, he hears her sniffles before he sees her but the pair of silver heeled shoes confirms who it is. (Harry does listen, okay, even when the girls are talking about things he doesn&rsquo;t care for like earrings and what lipstick looks best with different dresses.)</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; He makes sure to say in the most normal voice he can do, sitting a foot away from her on the cold of the metal seats so to not overwhelm her. &ldquo;Want to tell me what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>Tilly clears her throat, swiping her fingers under her eyes to collect the wetness her tears had left. Shaking her head while letting out a breathy laugh she says, &ldquo;Why do you care?&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t mean to sound as harsh as she does, but there&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s feeling much too hurt to think properly.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, you know I care about you.&rdquo; Ensuring his tone is smooth, Harry places a caring hand on her shoulder, feeling her cool skin under his palm, the thin strapped light blue dress not doing much to conceal her from the chilly breeze. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, at least let me drive you home.&rdquo; \u00a0He reasons.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go home. My parents will ask me too many questions and I&rsquo;ll have to tell them why this is the worst birthday I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo; Standing rather abruptly, Tilly&rsquo;s heels click against the metal steps of the bleachers as she scrambles down to the path.</p><p>A part of Harry thinks he should let her be, I mean clearly she doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about it, at least not with him, so maybe she&rsquo;d rather talk to Valerie? But the other part, a bigger part, knows he shouldn&rsquo;t leave her alone when she&rsquo;s this upset.</p><p>&ldquo;Tilly, wait.&rdquo; His command falls on deaf ears as he rushes down the steps, &ldquo;Matilda.&rdquo; Resulting to using her full name, she stops in her tracks and turns to face him with fresh tears brimming at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t like being called that.&rdquo; Her voice is fragile and all Harry wants to do is curl her up into a hug, but he lets that stay in his imagination.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s sincere, &ldquo;Look, let&rsquo;s go on a drive, okay?&rdquo; Tilly ponders the offer, adjusting her clutch purse so it rests under her arm rather than in a tight grasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we go past the drive-thru?&rdquo; Her puppy dog like eyes take no longer than three seconds to convince Harry and he mutters an &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Before leading the way from the field to his car.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only 20 minutes later, after going through the drive-thru and grabbing two sodas and some fries to share, Harry decides to drive up to the lookout knowing it should be quite since every teenager in town was at the winter formal.</p><p>Tilly is very quite as Harry drives up the dirt road leading to the spot that looks over the entire town, keeping her stare out the window. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for being mean.&rdquo; Her apology earns a shake of the head from Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing to be sorry for.&rdquo;</p><p>Pulling up to the lookout, Harry turns off the car and gets out with Tilly following suit. They hop up onto the hood of the car, facing out to see the view of their town lit up in warm yellow lights. You could even make out the lights of the town christmas tree if you look hard enough.</p><p>&ldquo;He wanted to sleep with me.&rdquo; Tilly looks down, fiddling with her own hands in her lap, &ldquo;That was his goal.&rdquo; She feels pathetic, letting more tears drop onto the fabric of her dress as she finally reveals the truth to Harry.</p><p>Harry doesn&rsquo;t need to ask who she&rsquo;s talking about to know it&rsquo;s Dean. His jaw clenches when he hears her say it, a mix of anger and hopelessness filling his body. Anger at Dean, the douchebag prick, who just had to go and hurt an innocent girl on her birthday and hopelessness for Tilly, wishing there was someway she didn&rsquo;t have to feel this shitty and could actually enjoy a day that is supposed to be all about her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Till.&rdquo; Harry sighs, looking over at the sweet girl sitting next to him. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t deserve that.&rdquo;</p><p>Another humourless laugh leaves her mouth, her eyes sparkling with the reflection of the lights of the town in front of them. &ldquo;All I wanted was to dance on my birthday. I was so excited when I heard that Dean of all people wanted to dance with me, how stupid is that?&rdquo; She finally looks at Harry, holding his gaze for a moment, &ldquo;Turns out he really is just a jock who wants to get more girls than his friends.&rdquo; Sniffling a little, she turns her head back to the view.</p><p>Harry sits next to her, not having a clue of what to say, so he slides off the hood of his car, putting a cassette into the player in his car and turning the volume up so it&rsquo;s loud enough to hear from the outside but soft enough to not be annoying.</p><p>A little confused, Tilly watches as Harry fumbles around in his car until he comes to stand directly in front of her and holds his hand out to her. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; She giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;May I have this dance?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry swears he sees her eyes light up, a smile working its way to both of their faces as she places her hand into his much larger one. He helps her slide off the hood without wrecking her dress, steadying her once she&rsquo;s standing in front of him with his hands gently on her waist and hers coming down to rest on his shoulders close enough to his curls that she could twirl them around her fingertips if she wanted to.</p><p>The two of them sway quietly back and forth, the only sound being the low hum of the music and Tilly giggling every few minutes. They stay like that for a little while, Tilly&rsquo;s arms eventually moving from Harry&rsquo;s shoulders to wrap around his middle and her head coming to rest on his chest, just under his chin.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s not sure what to make of the situation. His heart is beating dangerously loud in his chest that he&rsquo;s sure Tilly can hear it through his shirt. Does he like Tilly as in like-like? Or is it just the circumstances that has him feeling mushy over his friend who he&rsquo;s holding so tenderly? As cliche as it sounds, Harry wishes this moment would last forever, the feeling of her a welcomed weight in his arms.</p><p>Tilly feels&hellip; content. She can hear the steady beat of Harry&rsquo;s heart in his chest that makes her feel at peace. Picking her head up from his chest, she looks up into his deep green eyes, wishing she could put her feeling into words for him to hear. She wants him to know she has feelings for him but the fear of rejection eats at her. At this point, her heartache from Dean is no more, the feeling of safety overcoming all else.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you didn&rsquo;t get to have a birthday like you planned.&rdquo; Harry says, a pout faint on his lips, eyes still locked into Tilly&rsquo;s.</p><p>Shaking her head lightly she says honestly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s ending like this.&rdquo; Harry chuckles like he doesn&rsquo;t believe her so she adds, &ldquo;Seriously, Harry. Thank you for giving me my birthday dance.&rdquo; Their gently swaying slows right down until they&rsquo;re just standing there, holding each other in between Harry&rsquo;s car and the fence that prevents them from falling off the cliff they&rsquo;re parked on.</p><p>Tilly doesn&rsquo;t know how or what makes her finally do it, but as quickly as she raises up on her tip toes to softy peck Harry&rsquo;s pink lips, she&rsquo;s back on her heels. Looking up to gauge his reaction she&rsquo;s met with his eyes staring more intently at her than they ever have before. She&rsquo;s just about convinced herself that she&rsquo;s made a mistake when she feels his hands move from where they were resting on her sides to cup her face, fingers curled in the hair behind her ears and thumbs stroking the tops of her cheekbones.</p><p>Leaning down, Harry delicately slots his lips with Tilly&rsquo;s, bottom lip pressing gently between hers as she puckers to reciprocate the feeling. The corny feeling of butterflies creeping its way to both of their stomachs, heat rising to their cheeks as they move in unison, mouths disconnecting only to connect at a different angle as they figure each other out. Harry&rsquo;s lips are much softer than Tilly had ever imagined, hers the tiniest bit sticky with the lip gloss that had managed to stay on throughout the night&rsquo;s dramas.</p><p>Pulling away, the two teenagers can&rsquo;t help but let bashful grins form on their faces, chuckling at what they had just done. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;d argue this was a pretty perfect birthday after all.&rdquo; Tilly giggles and Harry decides then and there that it&rsquo;s his favourite sound.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday.&rdquo; He presses a warm kiss to her cheek, moving his arms to wind back around her waist and laying his head into the crook of her neck, effectively embracing her in the most tender hug he thinks he&rsquo;s every given anyone (except his mom of course). Rising back up on her toes slightly, Tilly wraps her arms around Harry&rsquo;s neck, pressing her body further into his and returning the embrace.</p><p>A sudden realization dawns on her, &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Brows furrowed, she pulls away from Harry to only then realize she isn&rsquo;t wearing a watch.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh,&rdquo; Checking his watch, Harry struggles to read it and angles it better against the faint light of the street lamp near them before saying, &ldquo;Eleven-thirty-three, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>Eyes wide, Tilly takes a deep breath in, &ldquo;My curfew is 12, if I&rsquo;m not home by then my parents will <i>flip</i>.&rdquo; Her hands absentmindedly move to fiddle with the rings on Harry&rsquo;s watch-free hand. He&rsquo;s a little amused if he&rsquo;s honest, seeing her fidgety over possibly missing curfew. But he&rsquo;d never purposefully get her in trouble, knowing she&rsquo;s a little bit of a goody-two-shoes and would be super mad if she got grounded. (Which also meant Harry wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see her outside of school but he&rsquo;ll keep that to himself.)</p><p>&ldquo;Relax, it&rsquo;s only 15 minutes drive from here, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He pulls her by hand to the passenger side of the car and like a true gentleman, opens the door and makes sure her legs are tucked in before shutting it.</p><p>True to his word, 15 minutes later Harry pulls up to Tilly&rsquo;s kerb, shifting the car into park with 5 minutes to spare according to the clock on the dash.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Harry.&rdquo; She turns sideways in the seat to face him and that&rsquo;s when Harry can see the day catching up to her, her eyes heavy with sleep yet still glimmering. He chuckles, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already said that.&rdquo;</p><p>Pushing against the centre console, Tilly reaches across to press a final kiss to Harry&rsquo;s cheek, unintentionally right next to the corner of his mouth making him smile in admiration. &ldquo;Goodnight, Harry.&rdquo; Her voice is soft.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Tilly.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry watches as she walks up the stone path to her front door and after ensuring she&rsquo;s safely inside, shifts the car into drive and heads home, no doubt to stay up thinking about how crazy she makes him. In a good way, of course.</p>",

Tilly has always appreciated her Mother\u2019s efforts when it comes to special occasions and finds it quite comical that her Father agrees with all her decor decisions, despite not caring for the over-the-top-ness of it all.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cMom!\u201d A gasp leaves Tilly as she finally opens the lavender colored box, a pair of strappy, short silver heels resting on top of white tissue paper. \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t mind wearing my white flats.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut I saw how much you loved them when you tried them on in the store.\u201d Her Mother says fondly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t babble on about the price. Your Father was able to talk the manager into a sweet deal.\u201d She pats her husbands knee, the two of them perched on the edge of the coffee table with Tilly sat in the comfortable armchair usually reserved for her Father.</p><p>Moving the box to the ground, Tilly stands, embracing her parents in an appreciative hug and a kiss to their cheek each. \u201cThank you, thank you! I can\u2019t wait to wear these tonight!\u201d She squeals in delight, the thought of her outfit for tonight\u2019s winter formal coming together perfectly.</p><p>December marks not only Tilly\u2019s birthday, but the start of winter which means her high school\u2019s winter formal was only around the corner. Lucky for her, it just so happens to fall on her birthday this year which means she had an excuse to dress up and have fun with her friends. (It also serves as an unofficial birthday party which makes it even better.)</p><p>After a breakfast of waffles and syrup - her favorite breakfast - Tilly takes her time getting ready, choosing to wear her new pair of mid-wash bell bottoms with a soft, cream colored sweater that her Grandma had given her last Christmas.</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday, Tilly!!!!\u201d A scream is more or less heard from the kerb as Tilly leaves for school.</p><p>There, leaning out the passenger window of the car, is her best friend Valerie with her super curly locks blowing around in the morning breeze. Tilly skips down the path leading from her front door to the street and quickly embraces Valerie in a tight hug before jumping in the back seat next to her other friends Doug and Bobby.</p><p>She\u2019s met with a round of birthday wishes from the two boys and politely thanks them before making eye contact with the driver through the rear view mirror. \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d He says in a gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Harry.\u201d Tilly hopes he sees her sincere smile through the small mirror as he pulls away from her front kerb and starts the short drive to school.</p><p>Tilly has always had a <i>slight</i> crush Harry. And really, who could blame her? He had grown his hair out so the brown curls just touched the top of his shoulders and for some reason taken more of an interest in her compared to what he used to. But she convinced herself that he would never like her back after over-hearing him tell Bobby that she wasn\u2019t his type one day when she showed up earlier than usual to their hang out spot.</p><p>Their little gang of friends formed during the summer going into 9th grade with the five of them bonding over the fear of high school, especially the older kids (seniors are scary when you\u2019re a freshman okay?) and new found responsibilities. Tilly had been friends with Valerie the longest, since 5th grade, but she definitely considers the boys her best friends too.</p><p>Harry isn\u2019t the most outgoing when compared to Bobby or Doug, who can just about cause a ruckus anywhere they go, but he is arguably the most likeable out of the group. His personality radiates with a level of confidence and charm that people can\u2019t help but fall for. Tilly even remembers her parents saying how much of a nice boy Harry was when the gang had dinner at her house for her birthday last year. The two have never really been able to get to know each other on a personal one-on-one level, having to avoid harmless teasing from the rest of their friends, so they only really hang out in group settings.</p><p>The car ride to school is spent listening softly to Queen playing on the radio and Valerie turning around to chat with the three in the back seat. Once at school, Tilly is whisked away by Valerie to the second floor girls restroom where she almost squeals in excitement.</p><p>\u201cVal, why are you smiling so much? You\u2019re kinda scaring me.\u201d Tilly is skeptical, her best friend only usually in this mood when she has some <i>interesting</i> gossip or has a secret that she can\u2019t hold in.</p><p>Valerie takes a deep breath, \u201cDean told Maria who told Kayla who told me that Dean\u2019s going to ask you to dance and then on a date tonight!\u201d She says so fast she struggles to regain her breath for a second afterwards.</p><p>Tilly can\u2019t help the shocked smile that finds its way to her face. Dean was the star of the football team, which made him the most popular guy in school and not surprisingly, the boy almost every girl wished they could go out with.</p><p>\u201cFar out, Val!\u201d Tilly quickly checks who could overhear their private conversation in the bathroom and after finding the coast is clear, she lets out a laugh in disbelief. The most popular boy in school wants to not only dance with her at the winter formal, but ask out?! Tilly couldn\u2019t really believe it.</p><p>The school bell shrills and the sound of lockers slamming shut follows as the girls file out of the bathroom and to their first class of the day. Valerie says a quick goodbye to Tilly, the sound of her clogs hitting the floor as she runs to a meeting. Being on the school events committee, she had a whole day of preparation and meetings for the impending winter formal. Luckily though, it was only a half day so students (especially the girls) had enough time to get ready with little complaints.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you all smiley?\u201d Harry says as Tilly plops down at the desk beside his.</p><p>Letting the grin fall slightly from her face (she didn\u2019t think she was smiling that much but clearly she thought wrong), she shakes her head dismissively. \u201cJust a wonderful birthday so far.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s met with a nod from Harry and the two turn to face their teacher who\u2019s stuck-in-the-60\u2019s style is in full swing.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t really like school dances. He wouldn\u2019t say he hates them because they really aren\u2019t that bad. He just doesn\u2019t care for the fuss of it all and honestly, he\u2019d rather just hang out with his friends in Doug\u2019s garage like usual.</p><p>The three boys are currently sat in said garage-turned hangout spot, a small tv on a table against the wall and a couch with some bean bags strewn around. Bobby\u2019s sat on the stool behind the drum set and Harry\u2019s sat on the largest of the bean bags (arguably his designated seat) with an acoustic guitar in his grip. Music has always been an important part of Harry\u2019s life, his guitar being his most prized possession. It also helps that Bobby plays a little guitar (he\u2019s not so great on the drums) so the two often have little jam sessions with Doug either obnoxiously singing along or just reading a comic in the presence of his mates.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the girls?\u201d Doug mumbles from his spot, laying on the couch, with a G-I Joe in his hand. He\u2019d never let anyone outside his gang know how much he loves dolls (or action figures as he insists).</p><p>\u201cVal\u2019s probably still decorating the gym,\u201d Bobby answers as he taps the symbols of the drums lightly, \u201cTilly\u2019s probably already getting ready for her big night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard Dean\u2019s gonna get with her tonight.\u201d Doug chimes in which causes Harry to suddenly stop his light strumming on the guitar.</p><p>Trying to conceal his shock, he clears his throat before saying, \u201cSince when was Dean interested in Tilly?\u201d Sitting up higher in the bean bag he adds, \u201cHe\u2019s an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to the girls he\u2019s not.\u201d A shrug of Doug\u2019s shoulders follows as he places the action figure neatly on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI reckon girls like that, man.\u201d Moving from the drums to the couch, Bobby sits himself next to Doug and turns to face Harry. \u201cVal told me that she personally likes a guy who\u2019s not all over her. She likes a challenge.\u201d His eyebrows raise and fall after he sees their skepticism. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ve been different around her?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an unspoken truth that Bobby is in love with Valerie, everybody knows it, maybe even Valerie herself but nothing has come of it yet. Neither have confessed their feelings to the other so the other three have to put up with the back and forth between the two.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think Valerie of all people will fall for your little act.\u201d Harry\u2019s tone is harmless, knowing Bobby doesn\u2019t mind a little teasing.</p><p>Bobby scoffs, \u201cWhatever, man.\u201d Earning a laugh from Doug who proceeds to play wrestle with him over the back of the couch.</p><p>That\u2019s more or less Harry\u2019s cue to leave, not wanting to hurt himself before the dance tonight. (He won\u2019t admit it, but he does care how he looks at these events, pretty girls have that effect on him.)</p><p>*</p><p>9pm. The winter formal is in full swing, Valerie running her tiny self around the gym making sure everyone\u2019s having a good time and no one spikes the punch bowl, Doug devouring the snacks table and Bobby and Harry hanging next to the bleachers mostly keeping to themselves with the odd teacher attempting at small talk every 20 minutes.</p><p>The only person who\u2019s location is unknown, is Tilly\u2019s. Harry had briefly seen her chatting to some girls from the drama club when he arrived over an hour ago but hasn\u2019t seen her since. Plus, the gym is pretty huge and he\u2019s pretty sure the entire school is at this dance so he\u2019s surprised he hasn\u2019t even lost Bobby yet. (Doug never strays more than 20 feet from the refreshments table at school dances so no one really worries about him wandering off.)</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done a really great job with this whole thing, Val.\u201d Bobby says bashfully as Valerie approaches them with a slight look of exhaustion on her face. \u201cAnd you look amazing.\u201d He adds for good measure, earning a slap on the back from Harry.</p><p>Valerie smiles warmly, \u201cThanks, Bobby.\u201d Pulling him in for a hug, Harry\u2019s sure he heard Bobby\u2019s heart stop beating for a few seconds, this being the most affection she has ever shown to her not-so-secret admirer in the few years they\u2019ve been friends.</p><p>It makes Harry happy, seeing his best friend get a little something from his crush even if it was as tiny as something like a hug.</p><p>When a slow and melodious song starts playing through the speakers, Valerie gasps, pulling Bobby\u2019s hand into her own, \u201cDance with me?\u201d</p><p>Once again, Harry swears he hears Bobby\u2019s heart convulse but before the two can get away from him and onto the dance floor he stops Valerie.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Tilly?\u201d He tries not to give off a worried tone, but Tilly is his friend and he can\u2019t help but be a little worried that he hasn\u2019t spoken to her at all this evening. And it\u2019s her birthday after all so he wants to know she\u2019s having a good time.</p><p>\u201cNo, last I saw she was talking to Ms. Davis. But if you see her tell her I\u2019m looking for her!\u201d And with that she whisks Bobby away and into the crowd of teenagers who even during a slow song, try to grind up on each other.</p><p>Harry spots Ms. Davis by the entrance to the gym, \u201cOh, young Harry Styles how are finding this years winter formal? The committee did a wonderful job don\u2019t you think?\u201d The teacher in her mid-60\u2019s speaks in a way that Harry can only describe as old-lady-like.</p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d his answer is somewhat sincere, \u201cHave you seen Tilly around?\u201d</p><p>Ms. Davis ponders for a moment, \u201cOh yes, I did see her leave a few minutes ago and she looked a little upset.\u201d Harry won\u2019t admit it out loud but he does feel a sense of despair hearing those words.</p><p>\u201cThanks Ms. Davis.\u201d A curt nod and tight lipped smile is all Harry gives before making his way out of the gym, down the halls of the school and out through the front doors.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t immediately see Tilly so he decides to basically walk the perimeter of the school building, hoping to find a not-so-sad birthday girl. It takes him a few minutes but eventually he spots her sitting on the third step of the bleachers by the football field. Truthfully, he hears her sniffles before he sees her but the pair of silver heeled shoes confirms who it is. (Harry does listen, okay, even when the girls are talking about things he doesn\u2019t care for like earrings and what lipstick looks best with different dresses.)</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He makes sure to say in the most normal voice he can do, sitting a foot away from her on the cold of the metal seats so to not overwhelm her. \u201cWant to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Tilly clears her throat, swiping her fingers under her eyes to collect the wetness her tears had left. Shaking her head while letting out a breathy laugh she says, \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d She doesn\u2019t mean to sound as harsh as she does, but there\u2019s she\u2019s feeling much too hurt to think properly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, you know I care about you.\u201d Ensuring his tone is smooth, Harry places a caring hand on her shoulder, feeling her cool skin under his palm, the thin strapped light blue dress not doing much to conceal her from the chilly breeze. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it, at least let me drive you home.\u201d \u00a0He reasons.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. My parents will ask me too many questions and I\u2019ll have to tell them why this is the worst birthday I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Standing rather abruptly, Tilly\u2019s heels click against the metal steps of the bleachers as she scrambles down to the path.</p><p>A part of Harry thinks he should let her be, I mean clearly she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, at least not with him, so maybe she\u2019d rather talk to Valerie? But the other part, a bigger part, knows he shouldn\u2019t leave her alone when she\u2019s this upset.</p><p>\u201cTilly, wait.\u201d His command falls on deaf ears as he rushes down the steps, \u201cMatilda.\u201d Resulting to using her full name, she stops in her tracks and turns to face him with fresh tears brimming at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like being called that.\u201d Her voice is fragile and all Harry wants to do is curl her up into a hug, but he lets that stay in his imagination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He\u2019s sincere, \u201cLook, let\u2019s go on a drive, okay?\u201d Tilly ponders the offer, adjusting her clutch purse so it rests under her arm rather than in a tight grasp.</p><p>\u201cCan we go past the drive-thru?\u201d Her puppy dog like eyes take no longer than three seconds to convince Harry and he mutters an \u201cOf course.\u201d Before leading the way from the field to his car.</p><p>It\u2019s only 20 minutes later, after going through the drive-thru and grabbing two sodas and some fries to share, Harry decides to drive up to the lookout knowing it should be quite since every teenager in town was at the winter formal.</p><p>Tilly is very quite as Harry drives up the dirt road leading to the spot that looks over the entire town, keeping her stare out the window. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being mean.\u201d Her apology earns a shake of the head from Harry.</p><p>\u201cNothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>Pulling up to the lookout, Harry turns off the car and gets out with Tilly following suit. They hop up onto the hood of the car, facing out to see the view of their town lit up in warm yellow lights. You could even make out the lights of the town christmas tree if you look hard enough.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to sleep with me.\u201d Tilly looks down, fiddling with her own hands in her lap, \u201cThat was his goal.\u201d She feels pathetic, letting more tears drop onto the fabric of her dress as she finally reveals the truth to Harry.</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t need to ask who she\u2019s talking about to know it\u2019s Dean. His jaw clenches when he hears her say it, a mix of anger and hopelessness filling his body. Anger at Dean, the douchebag prick, who just had to go and hurt an innocent girl on her birthday and hopelessness for Tilly, wishing there was someway she didn\u2019t have to feel this shitty and could actually enjoy a day that is supposed to be all about her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Till.\u201d Harry sighs, looking over at the sweet girl sitting next to him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p><p>Another humourless laugh leaves her mouth, her eyes sparkling with the reflection of the lights of the town in front of them. \u201cAll I wanted was to dance on my birthday. I was so excited when I heard that Dean of all people wanted to dance with me, how stupid is that?\u201d She finally looks at Harry, holding his gaze for a moment, \u201cTurns out he really is just a jock who wants to get more girls than his friends.\u201d Sniffling a little, she turns her head back to the view.</p><p>Harry sits next to her, not having a clue of what to say, so he slides off the hood of his car, putting a cassette into the player in his car and turning the volume up so it\u2019s loud enough to hear from the outside but soft enough to not be annoying.</p><p>A little confused, Tilly watches as Harry fumbles around in his car until he comes to stand directly in front of her and holds his hand out to her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She giggles.</p><p>\u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>Harry swears he sees her eyes light up, a smile working its way to both of their faces as she places her hand into his much larger one. He helps her slide off the hood without wrecking her dress, steadying her once she\u2019s standing in front of him with his hands gently on her waist and hers coming down to rest on his shoulders close enough to his curls that she could twirl them around her fingertips if she wanted to.</p><p>The two of them sway quietly back and forth, the only sound being the low hum of the music and Tilly giggling every few minutes. They stay like that for a little while, Tilly\u2019s arms eventually moving from Harry\u2019s shoulders to wrap around his middle and her head coming to rest on his chest, just under his chin.</p><p>Harry\u2019s not sure what to make of the situation. His heart is beating dangerously loud in his chest that he\u2019s sure Tilly can hear it through his shirt. Does he like Tilly as in like-like? Or is it just the circumstances that has him feeling mushy over his friend who he\u2019s holding so tenderly? As cliche as it sounds, Harry wishes this moment would last forever, the feeling of her a welcomed weight in his arms.</p><p>Tilly feels\u2026 content. She can hear the steady beat of Harry\u2019s heart in his chest that makes her feel at peace. Picking her head up from his chest, she looks up into his deep green eyes, wishing she could put her feeling into words for him to hear. She wants him to know she has feelings for him but the fear of rejection eats at her. At this point, her heartache from Dean is no more, the feeling of safety overcoming all else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to have a birthday like you planned.\u201d Harry says, a pout faint on his lips, eyes still locked into Tilly\u2019s.</p><p>Shaking her head lightly she says honestly, \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s ending like this.\u201d Harry chuckles like he doesn\u2019t believe her so she adds, \u201cSeriously, Harry. Thank you for giving me my birthday dance.\u201d Their gently swaying slows right down until they\u2019re just standing there, holding each other in between Harry\u2019s car and the fence that prevents them from falling off the cliff they\u2019re parked on.</p><p>Tilly doesn\u2019t know how or what makes her finally do it, but as quickly as she raises up on her tip toes to softy peck Harry\u2019s pink lips, she\u2019s back on her heels. Looking up to gauge his reaction she\u2019s met with his eyes staring more intently at her than they ever have before. She\u2019s just about convinced herself that she\u2019s made a mistake when she feels his hands move from where they were resting on her sides to cup her face, fingers curled in the hair behind her ears and thumbs stroking the tops of her cheekbones.</p><p>Leaning down, Harry delicately slots his lips with Tilly\u2019s, bottom lip pressing gently between hers as she puckers to reciprocate the feeling. The corny feeling of butterflies creeping its way to both of their stomachs, heat rising to their cheeks as they move in unison, mouths disconnecting only to connect at a different angle as they figure each other out. Harry\u2019s lips are much softer than Tilly had ever imagined, hers the tiniest bit sticky with the lip gloss that had managed to stay on throughout the night\u2019s dramas.</p><p>Pulling away, the two teenagers can\u2019t help but let bashful grins form on their faces, chuckling at what they had just done. \u201cNow I\u2019d argue this was a pretty perfect birthday after all.\u201d Tilly giggles and Harry decides then and there that it\u2019s his favourite sound.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday.\u201d He presses a warm kiss to her cheek, moving his arms to wind back around her waist and laying his head into the crook of her neck, effectively embracing her in the most tender hug he thinks he\u2019s every given anyone (except his mom of course). Rising back up on her toes slightly, Tilly wraps her arms around Harry\u2019s neck, pressing her body further into his and returning the embrace.</p><p>A sudden realization dawns on her, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Brows furrowed, she pulls away from Harry to only then realize she isn\u2019t wearing a watch.</p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Checking his watch, Harry struggles to read it and angles it better against the faint light of the street lamp near them before saying, \u201cEleven-thirty-three, I think.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, Tilly takes a deep breath in, \u201cMy curfew is 12, if I\u2019m not home by then my parents will <i>flip</i>.\u201d Her hands absentmindedly move to fiddle with the rings on Harry\u2019s watch-free hand. He\u2019s a little amused if he\u2019s honest, seeing her fidgety over possibly missing curfew. But he\u2019d never purposefully get her in trouble, knowing she\u2019s a little bit of a goody-two-shoes and would be super mad if she got grounded. (Which also meant Harry wouldn\u2019t be able to see her outside of school but he\u2019ll keep that to himself.)</p><p>\u201cRelax, it\u2019s only 15 minutes drive from here, let\u2019s go.\u201d He pulls her by hand to the passenger side of the car and like a true gentleman, opens the door and makes sure her legs are tucked in before shutting it.</p><p>True to his word, 15 minutes later Harry pulls up to Tilly\u2019s kerb, shifting the car into park with 5 minutes to spare according to the clock on the dash.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Harry.\u201d She turns sideways in the seat to face him and that\u2019s when Harry can see the day catching up to her, her eyes heavy with sleep yet still glimmering. He chuckles, \u201cYou\u2019ve already said that.\u201d</p><p>Pushing against the centre console, Tilly reaches across to press a final kiss to Harry\u2019s cheek, unintentionally right next to the corner of his mouth making him smile in admiration. \u201cGoodnight, Harry.\u201d Her voice is soft.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Tilly.\u201d</p><p>Harry watches as she walks up the stone path to her front door and after ensuring she\u2019s safely inside, shifts the car into drive and heads home, no doubt to stay up thinking about how crazy she makes him. In a good way, of course.</p>",

So I wrote this with the intention of it being set in 1977, although I don\u2019t think I did a fantastic job of conveying that (I tried ok) so it\u2019s pretty easy to just imagine it however you\u2019d like! ALSO I wrote this both on my laptop and my phone where the spell check/grammar check is different so please excuse any switches between british spelling and american spelling. Please let me know what you think, I\u2019d really appreciate it. Hope you like it!) </p><p>\u2013</p><p>December 1st, 1977. Tilly\u2019s 17th Birthday. It would be like most days if not for the crazy amount of balloons and streamers decorating the living room, where she sits in her pyjamas carefully unwrapping the bow tied around the box in her lap. Tilly\u2019s never been one to worry too much over her birthday, her parents however (more specifically her Mother), have always made a fuss over the day despite her constant re-assurance that she\u2019s just happy with homemade cupcakes and a new pair of bell bottoms.</p><p>Her parents had woken her up especially early so she could see the decorations and be wished a proper happy birthday before shuffling off to school. Tilly has always appreciated her Mother\u2019s efforts when it comes to special occasions and finds it quite comical that her Father agrees with all her decor decisions, despite not caring for the over-the-top-ness of it all.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cMom!\u201d A gasp leaves Tilly as she finally opens the lavender colored box, a pair of strappy, short silver heels resting on top of white tissue paper. \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t mind wearing my white flats.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut I saw how much you loved them when you tried them on in the store.\u201d Her Mother says fondly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t babble on about the price. Your Father was able to talk the manager into a sweet deal.\u201d She pats her husbands knee, the two of them perched on the edge of the coffee table with Tilly sat in the comfortable armchair usually reserved for her Father.</p><p>Moving the box to the ground, Tilly stands, embracing her parents in an appreciative hug and a kiss to their cheek each. \u201cThank you, thank you! I can\u2019t wait to wear these tonight!\u201d She squeals in delight, the thought of her outfit for tonight\u2019s winter formal coming together perfectly.</p><p>December marks not only Tilly\u2019s birthday, but the start of winter which means her high school\u2019s winter formal was only around the corner. Lucky for her, it just so happens to fall on her birthday this year which means she had an excuse to dress up and have fun with her friends. (It also serves as an unofficial birthday party which makes it even better.)</p><p>After a breakfast of waffles and syrup - her favorite breakfast - Tilly takes her time getting ready, choosing to wear her new pair of mid-wash bell bottoms with a soft, cream colored sweater that her Grandma had given her last Christmas.</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday, Tilly!!!!\u201d A scream is more or less heard from the kerb as Tilly leaves for school.</p><p>There, leaning out the passenger window of the car, is her best friend Valerie with her super curly locks blowing around in the morning breeze. Tilly skips down the path leading from her front door to the street and quickly embraces Valerie in a tight hug before jumping in the back seat next to her other friends Doug and Bobby.</p><p>She\u2019s met with a round of birthday wishes from the two boys and politely thanks them before making eye contact with the driver through the rear view mirror. \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d He says in a gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Harry.\u201d Tilly hopes he sees her sincere smile through the small mirror as he pulls away from her front kerb and starts the short drive to school.</p><p>Tilly has always had a <i>slight</i> crush Harry. And really, who could blame her? He had grown his hair out so the brown curls just touched the top of his shoulders and for some reason taken more of an interest in her compared to what he used to. But she convinced herself that he would never like her back after over-hearing him tell Bobby that she wasn\u2019t his type one day when she showed up earlier than usual to their hang out spot.</p><p>Their little gang of friends formed during the summer going into 9th grade with the five of them bonding over the fear of high school, especially the older kids (seniors are scary when you\u2019re a freshman okay?) and new found responsibilities. Tilly had been friends with Valerie the longest, since 5th grade, but she definitely considers the boys her best friends too.</p><p>Harry isn\u2019t the most outgoing when compared to Bobby or Doug, who can just about cause a ruckus anywhere they go, but he is arguably the most likeable out of the group. His personality radiates with a level of confidence and charm that people can\u2019t help but fall for. Tilly even remembers her parents saying how much of a nice boy Harry was when the gang had dinner at her house for her birthday last year. The two have never really been able to get to know each other on a personal one-on-one level, having to avoid harmless teasing from the rest of their friends, so they only really hang out in group settings.</p><p>The car ride to school is spent listening softly to Queen playing on the radio and Valerie turning around to chat with the three in the back seat. Once at school, Tilly is whisked away by Valerie to the second floor girls restroom where she almost squeals in excitement.</p><p>\u201cVal, why are you smiling so much? You\u2019re kinda scaring me.\u201d Tilly is skeptical, her best friend only usually in this mood when she has some <i>interesting</i> gossip or has a secret that she can\u2019t hold in.</p><p>Valerie takes a deep breath, \u201cDean told Maria who told Kayla who told me that Dean\u2019s going to ask you to dance and then on a date tonight!\u201d She says so fast she struggles to regain her breath for a second afterwards.</p><p>Tilly can\u2019t help the shocked smile that finds its way to her face. Dean was the star of the football team, which made him the most popular guy in school and not surprisingly, the boy almost every girl wished they could go out with.</p><p>\u201cFar out, Val!\u201d Tilly quickly checks who could overhear their private conversation in the bathroom and after finding the coast is clear, she lets out a laugh in disbelief. The most popular boy in school wants to not only dance with her at the winter formal, but ask out?! Tilly couldn\u2019t really believe it.</p><p>The school bell shrills and the sound of lockers slamming shut follows as the girls file out of the bathroom and to their first class of the day. Valerie says a quick goodbye to Tilly, the sound of her clogs hitting the floor as she runs to a meeting. Being on the school events committee, she had a whole day of preparation and meetings for the impending winter formal. Luckily though, it was only a half day so students (especially the girls) had enough time to get ready with little complaints.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you all smiley?\u201d Harry says as Tilly plops down at the desk beside his.</p><p>Letting the grin fall slightly from her face (she didn\u2019t think she was smiling that much but clearly she thought wrong), she shakes her head dismissively. \u201cJust a wonderful birthday so far.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s met with a nod from Harry and the two turn to face their teacher who\u2019s stuck-in-the-60\u2019s style is in full swing.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t really like school dances. He wouldn\u2019t say he hates them because they really aren\u2019t that bad. He just doesn\u2019t care for the fuss of it all and honestly, he\u2019d rather just hang out with his friends in Doug\u2019s garage like usual.</p><p>The three boys are currently sat in said garage-turned hangout spot, a small tv on a table against the wall and a couch with some bean bags strewn around. Bobby\u2019s sat on the stool behind the drum set and Harry\u2019s sat on the largest of the bean bags (arguably his designated seat) with an acoustic guitar in his grip. Music has always been an important part of Harry\u2019s life, his guitar being his most prized possession. It also helps that Bobby plays a little guitar (he\u2019s not so great on the drums) so the two often have little jam sessions with Doug either obnoxiously singing along or just reading a comic in the presence of his mates.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the girls?\u201d Doug mumbles from his spot, laying on the couch, with a G-I Joe in his hand. He\u2019d never let anyone outside his gang know how much he loves dolls (or action figures as he insists).</p><p>\u201cVal\u2019s probably still decorating the gym,\u201d Bobby answers as he taps the symbols of the drums lightly, \u201cTilly\u2019s probably already getting ready for her big night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard Dean\u2019s gonna get with her tonight.\u201d Doug chimes in which causes Harry to suddenly stop his light strumming on the guitar.</p><p>Trying to conceal his shock, he clears his throat before saying, \u201cSince when was Dean interested in Tilly?\u201d Sitting up higher in the bean bag he adds, \u201cHe\u2019s an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to the girls he\u2019s not.\u201d A shrug of Doug\u2019s shoulders follows as he places the action figure neatly on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI reckon girls like that, man.\u201d Moving from the drums to the couch, Bobby sits himself next to Doug and turns to face Harry. \u201cVal told me that she personally likes a guy who\u2019s not all over her. She likes a challenge.\u201d His eyebrows raise and fall after he sees their skepticism. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ve been different around her?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an unspoken truth that Bobby is in love with Valerie, everybody knows it, maybe even Valerie herself but nothing has come of it yet. Neither have confessed their feelings to the other so the other three have to put up with the back and forth between the two.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think Valerie of all people will fall for your little act.\u201d Harry\u2019s tone is harmless, knowing Bobby doesn\u2019t mind a little teasing.</p><p>Bobby scoffs, \u201cWhatever, man.\u201d Earning a laugh from Doug who proceeds to play wrestle with him over the back of the couch.</p><p>That\u2019s more or less Harry\u2019s cue to leave, not wanting to hurt himself before the dance tonight. (He won\u2019t admit it, but he does care how he looks at these events, pretty girls have that effect on him.)</p><p>*</p><p>9pm. The winter formal is in full swing, Valerie running her tiny self around the gym making sure everyone\u2019s having a good time and no one spikes the punch bowl, Doug devouring the snacks table and Bobby and Harry hanging next to the bleachers mostly keeping to themselves with the odd teacher attempting at small talk every 20 minutes.</p><p>The only person who\u2019s location is unknown, is Tilly\u2019s. Harry had briefly seen her chatting to some girls from the drama club when he arrived over an hour ago but hasn\u2019t seen her since. Plus, the gym is pretty huge and he\u2019s pretty sure the entire school is at this dance so he\u2019s surprised he hasn\u2019t even lost Bobby yet. (Doug never strays more than 20 feet from the refreshments table at school dances so no one really worries about him wandering off.)</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done a really great job with this whole thing, Val.\u201d Bobby says bashfully as Valerie approaches them with a slight look of exhaustion on her face. \u201cAnd you look amazing.\u201d He adds for good measure, earning a slap on the back from Harry.</p><p>Valerie smiles warmly, \u201cThanks, Bobby.\u201d Pulling him in for a hug, Harry\u2019s sure he heard Bobby\u2019s heart stop beating for a few seconds, this being the most affection she has ever shown to her not-so-secret admirer in the few years they\u2019ve been friends.</p><p>It makes Harry happy, seeing his best friend get a little something from his crush even if it was as tiny as something like a hug.</p><p>When a slow and melodious song starts playing through the speakers, Valerie gasps, pulling Bobby\u2019s hand into her own, \u201cDance with me?\u201d</p><p>Once again, Harry swears he hears Bobby\u2019s heart convulse but before the two can get away from him and onto the dance floor he stops Valerie.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Tilly?\u201d He tries not to give off a worried tone, but Tilly is his friend and he can\u2019t help but be a little worried that he hasn\u2019t spoken to her at all this evening. And it\u2019s her birthday after all so he wants to know she\u2019s having a good time.</p><p>\u201cNo, last I saw she was talking to Ms. Davis. But if you see her tell her I\u2019m looking for her!\u201d And with that she whisks Bobby away and into the crowd of teenagers who even during a slow song, try to grind up on each other.</p><p>Harry spots Ms. Davis by the entrance to the gym, \u201cOh, young Harry Styles how are finding this years winter formal? The committee did a wonderful job don\u2019t you think?\u201d The teacher in her mid-60\u2019s speaks in a way that Harry can only describe as old-lady-like.</p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d his answer is somewhat sincere, \u201cHave you seen Tilly around?\u201d</p><p>Ms. Davis ponders for a moment, \u201cOh yes, I did see her leave a few minutes ago and she looked a little upset.\u201d Harry won\u2019t admit it out loud but he does feel a sense of despair hearing those words.</p><p>\u201cThanks Ms. Davis.\u201d A curt nod and tight lipped smile is all Harry gives before making his way out of the gym, down the halls of the school and out through the front doors.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t immediately see Tilly so he decides to basically walk the perimeter of the school building, hoping to find a not-so-sad birthday girl. It takes him a few minutes but eventually he spots her sitting on the third step of the bleachers by the football field. Truthfully, he hears her sniffles before he sees her but the pair of silver heeled shoes confirms who it is. (Harry does listen, okay, even when the girls are talking about things he doesn\u2019t care for like earrings and what lipstick looks best with different dresses.)</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He makes sure to say in the most normal voice he can do, sitting a foot away from her on the cold of the metal seats so to not overwhelm her. \u201cWant to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Tilly clears her throat, swiping her fingers under her eyes to collect the wetness her tears had left. Shaking her head while letting out a breathy laugh she says, \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d She doesn\u2019t mean to sound as harsh as she does, but there\u2019s she\u2019s feeling much too hurt to think properly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, you know I care about you.\u201d Ensuring his tone is smooth, Harry places a caring hand on her shoulder, feeling her cool skin under his palm, the thin strapped light blue dress not doing much to conceal her from the chilly breeze. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it, at least let me drive you home.\u201d \u00a0He reasons.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. My parents will ask me too many questions and I\u2019ll have to tell them why this is the worst birthday I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Standing rather abruptly, Tilly\u2019s heels click against the metal steps of the bleachers as she scrambles down to the path.</p><p>A part of Harry thinks he should let her be, I mean clearly she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, at least not with him, so maybe she\u2019d rather talk to Valerie? But the other part, a bigger part, knows he shouldn\u2019t leave her alone when she\u2019s this upset.</p><p>\u201cTilly, wait.\u201d His command falls on deaf ears as he rushes down the steps, \u201cMatilda.\u201d Resulting to using her full name, she stops in her tracks and turns to face him with fresh tears brimming at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like being called that.\u201d Her voice is fragile and all Harry wants to do is curl her up into a hug, but he lets that stay in his imagination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He\u2019s sincere, \u201cLook, let\u2019s go on a drive, okay?\u201d Tilly ponders the offer, adjusting her clutch purse so it rests under her arm rather than in a tight grasp.</p><p>\u201cCan we go past the drive-thru?\u201d Her puppy dog like eyes take no longer than three seconds to convince Harry and he mutters an \u201cOf course.\u201d Before leading the way from the field to his car.</p><p>It\u2019s only 20 minutes later, after going through the drive-thru and grabbing two sodas and some fries to share, Harry decides to drive up to the lookout knowing it should be quite since every teenager in town was at the winter formal.</p><p>Tilly is very quite as Harry drives up the dirt road leading to the spot that looks over the entire town, keeping her stare out the window. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being mean.\u201d Her apology earns a shake of the head from Harry.</p><p>\u201cNothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>Pulling up to the lookout, Harry turns off the car and gets out with Tilly following suit. They hop up onto the hood of the car, facing out to see the view of their town lit up in warm yellow lights. You could even make out the lights of the town christmas tree if you look hard enough.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to sleep with me.\u201d Tilly looks down, fiddling with her own hands in her lap, \u201cThat was his goal.\u201d She feels pathetic, letting more tears drop onto the fabric of her dress as she finally reveals the truth to Harry.</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t need to ask who she\u2019s talking about to know it\u2019s Dean. His jaw clenches when he hears her say it, a mix of anger and hopelessness filling his body. Anger at Dean, the douchebag prick, who just had to go and hurt an innocent girl on her birthday and hopelessness for Tilly, wishing there was someway she didn\u2019t have to feel this shitty and could actually enjoy a day that is supposed to be all about her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Till.\u201d Harry sighs, looking over at the sweet girl sitting next to him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p><p>Another humourless laugh leaves her mouth, her eyes sparkling with the reflection of the lights of the town in front of them. \u201cAll I wanted was to dance on my birthday. I was so excited when I heard that Dean of all people wanted to dance with me, how stupid is that?\u201d She finally looks at Harry, holding his gaze for a moment, \u201cTurns out he really is just a jock who wants to get more girls than his friends.\u201d Sniffling a little, she turns her head back to the view.</p><p>Harry sits next to her, not having a clue of what to say, so he slides off the hood of his car, putting a cassette into the player in his car and turning the volume up so it\u2019s loud enough to hear from the outside but soft enough to not be annoying.</p><p>A little confused, Tilly watches as Harry fumbles around in his car until he comes to stand directly in front of her and holds his hand out to her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She giggles.</p><p>\u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>Harry swears he sees her eyes light up, a smile working its way to both of their faces as she places her hand into his much larger one. He helps her slide off the hood without wrecking her dress, steadying her once she\u2019s standing in front of him with his hands gently on her waist and hers coming down to rest on his shoulders close enough to his curls that she could twirl them around her fingertips if she wanted to.</p><p>The two of them sway quietly back and forth, the only sound being the low hum of the music and Tilly giggling every few minutes. They stay like that for a little while, Tilly\u2019s arms eventually moving from Harry\u2019s shoulders to wrap around his middle and her head coming to rest on his chest, just under his chin.</p><p>Harry\u2019s not sure what to make of the situation. His heart is beating dangerously loud in his chest that he\u2019s sure Tilly can hear it through his shirt. Does he like Tilly as in like-like? Or is it just the circumstances that has him feeling mushy over his friend who he\u2019s holding so tenderly? As cliche as it sounds, Harry wishes this moment would last forever, the feeling of her a welcomed weight in his arms.</p><p>Tilly feels\u2026 content. She can hear the steady beat of Harry\u2019s heart in his chest that makes her feel at peace. Picking her head up from his chest, she looks up into his deep green eyes, wishing she could put her feeling into words for him to hear. She wants him to know she has feelings for him but the fear of rejection eats at her. At this point, her heartache from Dean is no more, the feeling of safety overcoming all else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to have a birthday like you planned.\u201d Harry says, a pout faint on his lips, eyes still locked into Tilly\u2019s.</p><p>Shaking her head lightly she says honestly, \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s ending like this.\u201d Harry chuckles like he doesn\u2019t believe her so she adds, \u201cSeriously, Harry. Thank you for giving me my birthday dance.\u201d Their gently swaying slows right down until they\u2019re just standing there, holding each other in between Harry\u2019s car and the fence that prevents them from falling off the cliff they\u2019re parked on.</p><p>Tilly doesn\u2019t know how or what makes her finally do it, but as quickly as she raises up on her tip toes to softy peck Harry\u2019s pink lips, she\u2019s back on her heels. Looking up to gauge his reaction she\u2019s met with his eyes staring more intently at her than they ever have before. She\u2019s just about convinced herself that she\u2019s made a mistake when she feels his hands move from where they were resting on her sides to cup her face, fingers curled in the hair behind her ears and thumbs stroking the tops of her cheekbones.</p><p>Leaning down, Harry delicately slots his lips with Tilly\u2019s, bottom lip pressing gently between hers as she puckers to reciprocate the feeling. The corny feeling of butterflies creeping its way to both of their stomachs, heat rising to their cheeks as they move in unison, mouths disconnecting only to connect at a different angle as they figure each other out. Harry\u2019s lips are much softer than Tilly had ever imagined, hers the tiniest bit sticky with the lip gloss that had managed to stay on throughout the night\u2019s dramas.</p><p>Pulling away, the two teenagers can\u2019t help but let bashful grins form on their faces, chuckling at what they had just done. \u201cNow I\u2019d argue this was a pretty perfect birthday after all.\u201d Tilly giggles and Harry decides then and there that it\u2019s his favourite sound.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday.\u201d He presses a warm kiss to her cheek, moving his arms to wind back around her waist and laying his head into the crook of her neck, effectively embracing her in the most tender hug he thinks he\u2019s every given anyone (except his mom of course). Rising back up on her toes slightly, Tilly wraps her arms around Harry\u2019s neck, pressing her body further into his and returning the embrace.</p><p>A sudden realization dawns on her, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Brows furrowed, she pulls away from Harry to only then realize she isn\u2019t wearing a watch.</p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Checking his watch, Harry struggles to read it and angles it better against the faint light of the street lamp near them before saying, \u201cEleven-thirty-three, I think.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, Tilly takes a deep breath in, \u201cMy curfew is 12, if I\u2019m not home by then my parents will <i>flip</i>.\u201d Her hands absentmindedly move to fiddle with the rings on Harry\u2019s watch-free hand. He\u2019s a little amused if he\u2019s honest, seeing her fidgety over possibly missing curfew. But he\u2019d never purposefully get her in trouble, knowing she\u2019s a little bit of a goody-two-shoes and would be super mad if she got grounded. (Which also meant Harry wouldn\u2019t be able to see her outside of school but he\u2019ll keep that to himself.)</p><p>\u201cRelax, it\u2019s only 15 minutes drive from here, let\u2019s go.\u201d He pulls her by hand to the passenger side of the car and like a true gentleman, opens the door and makes sure her legs are tucked in before shutting it.</p><p>True to his word, 15 minutes later Harry pulls up to Tilly\u2019s kerb, shifting the car into park with 5 minutes to spare according to the clock on the dash.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Harry.\u201d She turns sideways in the seat to face him and that\u2019s when Harry can see the day catching up to her, her eyes heavy with sleep yet still glimmering. He chuckles, \u201cYou\u2019ve already said that.\u201d</p><p>Pushing against the centre console, Tilly reaches across to press a final kiss to Harry\u2019s cheek, unintentionally right next to the corner of his mouth making him smile in admiration. \u201cGoodnight, Harry.\u201d Her voice is soft.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Tilly.\u201d</p><p>Harry watches as she walks up the stone path to her front door and after ensuring she\u2019s safely inside, shifts the car into drive and heads home, no doubt to stay up thinking about how crazy she makes him. In a good way, of course.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>A highschool!au set in the 70&rsquo;s. </i></b><br /></p><p><b><i>Word count: 4.2k+</i></b></p><p>(A/N: Hey! So I wrote this with the intention of it being set in 1977, although I don&rsquo;t think I did a fantastic job of conveying that (I tried ok) so it&rsquo;s pretty easy to just imagine it however you&rsquo;d like! ALSO I wrote this both on my laptop and my phone where the spell check/grammar check is different so please excuse any switches between british spelling and american spelling. Please let me know what you think, I&rsquo;d really appreciate it. Hope you like it!) </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>December 1st, 1977. Tilly&rsquo;s 17th Birthday. It would be like most days if not for the crazy amount of balloons and streamers decorating the living room, where she sits in her pyjamas carefully unwrapping the bow tied around the box in her lap. Tilly&rsquo;s never been one to worry too much over her birthday, her parents however (more specifically her Mother), have always made a fuss over the day despite her constant re-assurance that she&rsquo;s just happy with homemade cupcakes and a new pair of bell bottoms.</p><p>Her parents had woken her up especially early so she could see the decorations and be wished a proper happy birthday before shuffling off to school. Tilly has always appreciated her Mother&rsquo;s efforts when it comes to special occasions and finds it quite comical that her Father agrees with all her decor decisions, despite not caring for the over-the-top-ness of it all.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; A gasp leaves Tilly as she finally opens the lavender colored box, a pair of strappy, short silver heels resting on top of white tissue paper. &ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t mind wearing my white flats.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But I saw how much you loved them when you tried them on in the store.&rdquo; Her Mother says fondly. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t babble on about the price. Your Father was able to talk the manager into a sweet deal.&rdquo; She pats her husbands knee, the two of them perched on the edge of the coffee table with Tilly sat in the comfortable armchair usually reserved for her Father.</p><p>Moving the box to the ground, Tilly stands, embracing her parents in an appreciative hug and a kiss to their cheek each. &ldquo;Thank you, thank you! I can&rsquo;t wait to wear these tonight!&rdquo; She squeals in delight, the thought of her outfit for tonight&rsquo;s winter formal coming together perfectly.</p><p>December marks not only Tilly&rsquo;s birthday, but the start of winter which means her high school&rsquo;s winter formal was only around the corner. Lucky for her, it just so happens to fall on her birthday this year which means she had an excuse to dress up and have fun with her friends. (It also serves as an unofficial birthday party which makes it even better.)</p><p>After a breakfast of waffles and syrup - her favorite breakfast - Tilly takes her time getting ready, choosing to wear her new pair of mid-wash bell bottoms with a soft, cream colored sweater that her Grandma had given her last Christmas.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy Birthday, Tilly!!!!&rdquo; A scream is more or less heard from the kerb as Tilly leaves for school.</p><p>There, leaning out the passenger window of the car, is her best friend Valerie with her super curly locks blowing around in the morning breeze. Tilly skips down the path leading from her front door to the street and quickly embraces Valerie in a tight hug before jumping in the back seat next to her other friends Doug and Bobby.</p><p>She&rsquo;s met with a round of birthday wishes from the two boys and politely thanks them before making eye contact with the driver through the rear view mirror. &ldquo;Happy Birthday.&rdquo; He says in a gruff voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Harry.&rdquo; Tilly hopes he sees her sincere smile through the small mirror as he pulls away from her front kerb and starts the short drive to school.</p><p>Tilly has always had a <i>slight</i> crush Harry. And really, who could blame her? He had grown his hair out so the brown curls just touched the top of his shoulders and for some reason taken more of an interest in her compared to what he used to. But she convinced herself that he would never like her back after over-hearing him tell Bobby that she wasn&rsquo;t his type one day when she showed up earlier than usual to their hang out spot.</p><p>Their little gang of friends formed during the summer going into 9th grade with the five of them bonding over the fear of high school, especially the older kids (seniors are scary when you&rsquo;re a freshman okay?) and new found responsibilities. Tilly had been friends with Valerie the longest, since 5th grade, but she definitely considers the boys her best friends too.</p><p>Harry isn&rsquo;t the most outgoing when compared to Bobby or Doug, who can just about cause a ruckus anywhere they go, but he is arguably the most likeable out of the group. His personality radiates with a level of confidence and charm that people can&rsquo;t help but fall for. Tilly even remembers her parents saying how much of a nice boy Harry was when the gang had dinner at her house for her birthday last year. The two have never really been able to get to know each other on a personal one-on-one level, having to avoid harmless teasing from the rest of their friends, so they only really hang out in group settings.</p><p>The car ride to school is spent listening softly to Queen playing on the radio and Valerie turning around to chat with the three in the back seat. Once at school, Tilly is whisked away by Valerie to the second floor girls restroom where she almost squeals in excitement.</p><p>&ldquo;Val, why are you smiling so much? You&rsquo;re kinda scaring me.&rdquo; Tilly is skeptical, her best friend only usually in this mood when she has some <i>interesting</i> gossip or has a secret that she can&rsquo;t hold in.</p><p>Valerie takes a deep breath, &ldquo;Dean told Maria who told Kayla who told me that Dean&rsquo;s going to ask you to dance and then on a date tonight!&rdquo; She says so fast she struggles to regain her breath for a second afterwards.</p><p>Tilly can&rsquo;t help the shocked smile that finds its way to her face. Dean was the star of the football team, which made him the most popular guy in school and not surprisingly, the boy almost every girl wished they could go out with.</p><p>&ldquo;Far out, Val!&rdquo; Tilly quickly checks who could overhear their private conversation in the bathroom and after finding the coast is clear, she lets out a laugh in disbelief. The most popular boy in school wants to not only dance with her at the winter formal, but ask out?! Tilly couldn&rsquo;t really believe it.</p><p>The school bell shrills and the sound of lockers slamming shut follows as the girls file out of the bathroom and to their first class of the day. Valerie says a quick goodbye to Tilly, the sound of her clogs hitting the floor as she runs to a meeting. Being on the school events committee, she had a whole day of preparation and meetings for the impending winter formal. Luckily though, it was only a half day so students (especially the girls) had enough time to get ready with little complaints.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you all smiley?&rdquo; Harry says as Tilly plops down at the desk beside his.</p><p>Letting the grin fall slightly from her face (she didn&rsquo;t think she was smiling that much but clearly she thought wrong), she shakes her head dismissively. &ldquo;Just a wonderful birthday so far.&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s met with a nod from Harry and the two turn to face their teacher who&rsquo;s stuck-in-the-60&rsquo;s style is in full swing.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry doesn&rsquo;t really like school dances. He wouldn&rsquo;t say he hates them because they really aren&rsquo;t that bad. He just doesn&rsquo;t care for the fuss of it all and honestly, he&rsquo;d rather just hang out with his friends in Doug&rsquo;s garage like usual.</p><p>The three boys are currently sat in said garage-turned hangout spot, a small tv on a table against the wall and a couch with some bean bags strewn around. Bobby&rsquo;s sat on the stool behind the drum set and Harry&rsquo;s sat on the largest of the bean bags (arguably his designated seat) with an acoustic guitar in his grip. Music has always been an important part of Harry&rsquo;s life, his guitar being his most prized possession. It also helps that Bobby plays a little guitar (he&rsquo;s not so great on the drums) so the two often have little jam sessions with Doug either obnoxiously singing along or just reading a comic in the presence of his mates.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are the girls?&rdquo; Doug mumbles from his spot, laying on the couch, with a G-I Joe in his hand. He&rsquo;d never let anyone outside his gang know how much he loves dolls (or action figures as he insists).</p><p>&ldquo;Val&rsquo;s probably still decorating the gym,&rdquo; Bobby answers as he taps the symbols of the drums lightly, &ldquo;Tilly&rsquo;s probably already getting ready for her big night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I heard Dean&rsquo;s gonna get with her tonight.&rdquo; Doug chimes in which causes Harry to suddenly stop his light strumming on the guitar.</p><p>Trying to conceal his shock, he clears his throat before saying, &ldquo;Since when was Dean interested in Tilly?&rdquo; Sitting up higher in the bean bag he adds, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not to the girls he&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; A shrug of Doug&rsquo;s shoulders follows as he places the action figure neatly on the coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;I reckon girls like that, man.&rdquo; Moving from the drums to the couch, Bobby sits himself next to Doug and turns to face Harry. &ldquo;Val told me that she personally likes a guy who&rsquo;s not all over her. She likes a challenge.&rdquo; His eyebrows raise and fall after he sees their skepticism. &ldquo;Why do you think I&rsquo;ve been different around her?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s an unspoken truth that Bobby is in love with Valerie, everybody knows it, maybe even Valerie herself but nothing has come of it yet. Neither have confessed their feelings to the other so the other three have to put up with the back and forth between the two.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy if you think Valerie of all people will fall for your little act.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s tone is harmless, knowing Bobby doesn&rsquo;t mind a little teasing.</p><p>Bobby scoffs, &ldquo;Whatever, man.&rdquo; Earning a laugh from Doug who proceeds to play wrestle with him over the back of the couch.</p><p>That&rsquo;s more or less Harry&rsquo;s cue to leave, not wanting to hurt himself before the dance tonight. (He won&rsquo;t admit it, but he does care how he looks at these events, pretty girls have that effect on him.)</p><p>*</p><p>9pm. The winter formal is in full swing, Valerie running her tiny self around the gym making sure everyone&rsquo;s having a good time and no one spikes the punch bowl, Doug devouring the snacks table and Bobby and Harry hanging next to the bleachers mostly keeping to themselves with the odd teacher attempting at small talk every 20 minutes.</p><p>The only person who&rsquo;s location is unknown, is Tilly&rsquo;s. Harry had briefly seen her chatting to some girls from the drama club when he arrived over an hour ago but hasn&rsquo;t seen her since. Plus, the gym is pretty huge and he&rsquo;s pretty sure the entire school is at this dance so he&rsquo;s surprised he hasn&rsquo;t even lost Bobby yet. (Doug never strays more than 20 feet from the refreshments table at school dances so no one really worries about him wandering off.)</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a really great job with this whole thing, Val.&rdquo; Bobby says bashfully as Valerie approaches them with a slight look of exhaustion on her face. &ldquo;And you look amazing.&rdquo; He adds for good measure, earning a slap on the back from Harry.</p><p>Valerie smiles warmly, &ldquo;Thanks, Bobby.&rdquo; Pulling him in for a hug, Harry&rsquo;s sure he heard Bobby&rsquo;s heart stop beating for a few seconds, this being the most affection she has ever shown to her not-so-secret admirer in the few years they&rsquo;ve been friends.</p><p>It makes Harry happy, seeing his best friend get a little something from his crush even if it was as tiny as something like a hug.</p><p>When a slow and melodious song starts playing through the speakers, Valerie gasps, pulling Bobby&rsquo;s hand into her own, &ldquo;Dance with me?&rdquo;</p><p>Once again, Harry swears he hears Bobby&rsquo;s heart convulse but before the two can get away from him and onto the dance floor he stops Valerie.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen Tilly?&rdquo; He tries not to give off a worried tone, but Tilly is his friend and he can&rsquo;t help but be a little worried that he hasn&rsquo;t spoken to her at all this evening. And it&rsquo;s her birthday after all so he wants to know she&rsquo;s having a good time.</p><p>&ldquo;No, last I saw she was talking to Ms. Davis. But if you see her tell her I&rsquo;m looking for her!&rdquo; And with that she whisks Bobby away and into the crowd of teenagers who even during a slow song, try to grind up on each other.</p><p>Harry spots Ms. Davis by the entrance to the gym, &ldquo;Oh, young Harry Styles how are finding this years winter formal? The committee did a wonderful job don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; The teacher in her mid-60&rsquo;s speaks in a way that Harry can only describe as old-lady-like.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s pretty cool,&rdquo; his answer is somewhat sincere, &ldquo;Have you seen Tilly around?&rdquo;</p><p>Ms. Davis ponders for a moment, &ldquo;Oh yes, I did see her leave a few minutes ago and she looked a little upset.&rdquo; Harry won&rsquo;t admit it out loud but he does feel a sense of despair hearing those words.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Ms. Davis.&rdquo; A curt nod and tight lipped smile is all Harry gives before making his way out of the gym, down the halls of the school and out through the front doors.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t immediately see Tilly so he decides to basically walk the perimeter of the school building, hoping to find a not-so-sad birthday girl. It takes him a few minutes but eventually he spots her sitting on the third step of the bleachers by the football field. Truthfully, he hears her sniffles before he sees her but the pair of silver heeled shoes confirms who it is. (Harry does listen, okay, even when the girls are talking about things he doesn&rsquo;t care for like earrings and what lipstick looks best with different dresses.)</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; He makes sure to say in the most normal voice he can do, sitting a foot away from her on the cold of the metal seats so to not overwhelm her. &ldquo;Want to tell me what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>Tilly clears her throat, swiping her fingers under her eyes to collect the wetness her tears had left. Shaking her head while letting out a breathy laugh she says, &ldquo;Why do you care?&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t mean to sound as harsh as she does, but there&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s feeling much too hurt to think properly.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, you know I care about you.&rdquo; Ensuring his tone is smooth, Harry places a caring hand on her shoulder, feeling her cool skin under his palm, the thin strapped light blue dress not doing much to conceal her from the chilly breeze. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, at least let me drive you home.&rdquo; &nbsp;He reasons.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go home. My parents will ask me too many questions and I&rsquo;ll have to tell them why this is the worst birthday I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo; Standing rather abruptly, Tilly&rsquo;s heels click against the metal steps of the bleachers as she scrambles down to the path.</p><p>A part of Harry thinks he should let her be, I mean clearly she doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about it, at least not with him, so maybe she&rsquo;d rather talk to Valerie? But the other part, a bigger part, knows he shouldn&rsquo;t leave her alone when she&rsquo;s this upset.</p><p>&ldquo;Tilly, wait.&rdquo; His command falls on deaf ears as he rushes down the steps, &ldquo;Matilda.&rdquo; Resulting to using her full name, she stops in her tracks and turns to face him with fresh tears brimming at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t like being called that.&rdquo; Her voice is fragile and all Harry wants to do is curl her up into a hug, but he lets that stay in his imagination.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s sincere, &ldquo;Look, let&rsquo;s go on a drive, okay?&rdquo; Tilly ponders the offer, adjusting her clutch purse so it rests under her arm rather than in a tight grasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we go past the drive-thru?&rdquo; Her puppy dog like eyes take no longer than three seconds to convince Harry and he mutters an &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Before leading the way from the field to his car.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only 20 minutes later, after going through the drive-thru and grabbing two sodas and some fries to share, Harry decides to drive up to the lookout knowing it should be quite since every teenager in town was at the winter formal.</p><p>Tilly is very quite as Harry drives up the dirt road leading to the spot that looks over the entire town, keeping her stare out the window. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for being mean.&rdquo; Her apology earns a shake of the head from Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing to be sorry for.&rdquo;</p><p>Pulling up to the lookout, Harry turns off the car and gets out with Tilly following suit. They hop up onto the hood of the car, facing out to see the view of their town lit up in warm yellow lights. You could even make out the lights of the town christmas tree if you look hard enough.</p><p>&ldquo;He wanted to sleep with me.&rdquo; Tilly looks down, fiddling with her own hands in her lap, &ldquo;That was his goal.&rdquo; She feels pathetic, letting more tears drop onto the fabric of her dress as she finally reveals the truth to Harry.</p><p>Harry doesn&rsquo;t need to ask who she&rsquo;s talking about to know it&rsquo;s Dean. His jaw clenches when he hears her say it, a mix of anger and hopelessness filling his body. Anger at Dean, the douchebag prick, who just had to go and hurt an innocent girl on her birthday and hopelessness for Tilly, wishing there was someway she didn&rsquo;t have to feel this shitty and could actually enjoy a day that is supposed to be all about her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Till.&rdquo; Harry sighs, looking over at the sweet girl sitting next to him. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t deserve that.&rdquo;</p><p>Another humourless laugh leaves her mouth, her eyes sparkling with the reflection of the lights of the town in front of them. &ldquo;All I wanted was to dance on my birthday. I was so excited when I heard that Dean of all people wanted to dance with me, how stupid is that?&rdquo; She finally looks at Harry, holding his gaze for a moment, &ldquo;Turns out he really is just a jock who wants to get more girls than his friends.&rdquo; Sniffling a little, she turns her head back to the view.</p><p>Harry sits next to her, not having a clue of what to say, so he slides off the hood of his car, putting a cassette into the player in his car and turning the volume up so it&rsquo;s loud enough to hear from the outside but soft enough to not be annoying.</p><p>A little confused, Tilly watches as Harry fumbles around in his car until he comes to stand directly in front of her and holds his hand out to her. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; She giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;May I have this dance?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry swears he sees her eyes light up, a smile working its way to both of their faces as she places her hand into his much larger one. He helps her slide off the hood without wrecking her dress, steadying her once she&rsquo;s standing in front of him with his hands gently on her waist and hers coming down to rest on his shoulders close enough to his curls that she could twirl them around her fingertips if she wanted to.</p><p>The two of them sway quietly back and forth, the only sound being the low hum of the music and Tilly giggling every few minutes. They stay like that for a little while, Tilly&rsquo;s arms eventually moving from Harry&rsquo;s shoulders to wrap around his middle and her head coming to rest on his chest, just under his chin.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s not sure what to make of the situation. His heart is beating dangerously loud in his chest that he&rsquo;s sure Tilly can hear it through his shirt. Does he like Tilly as in like-like? Or is it just the circumstances that has him feeling mushy over his friend who he&rsquo;s holding so tenderly? As cliche as it sounds, Harry wishes this moment would last forever, the feeling of her a welcomed weight in his arms.</p><p>Tilly feels&hellip; content. She can hear the steady beat of Harry&rsquo;s heart in his chest that makes her feel at peace. Picking her head up from his chest, she looks up into his deep green eyes, wishing she could put her feeling into words for him to hear. She wants him to know she has feelings for him but the fear of rejection eats at her. At this point, her heartache from Dean is no more, the feeling of safety overcoming all else.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you didn&rsquo;t get to have a birthday like you planned.&rdquo; Harry says, a pout faint on his lips, eyes still locked into Tilly&rsquo;s.</p><p>Shaking her head lightly she says honestly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s ending like this.&rdquo; Harry chuckles like he doesn&rsquo;t believe her so she adds, &ldquo;Seriously, Harry. Thank you for giving me my birthday dance.&rdquo; Their gently swaying slows right down until they&rsquo;re just standing there, holding each other in between Harry&rsquo;s car and the fence that prevents them from falling off the cliff they&rsquo;re parked on.</p><p>Tilly doesn&rsquo;t know how or what makes her finally do it, but as quickly as she raises up on her tip toes to softy peck Harry&rsquo;s pink lips, she&rsquo;s back on her heels. Looking up to gauge his reaction she&rsquo;s met with his eyes staring more intently at her than they ever have before. She&rsquo;s just about convinced herself that she&rsquo;s made a mistake when she feels his hands move from where they were resting on her sides to cup her face, fingers curled in the hair behind her ears and thumbs stroking the tops of her cheekbones.</p><p>Leaning down, Harry delicately slots his lips with Tilly&rsquo;s, bottom lip pressing gently between hers as she puckers to reciprocate the feeling. The corny feeling of butterflies creeping its way to both of their stomachs, heat rising to their cheeks as they move in unison, mouths disconnecting only to connect at a different angle as they figure each other out. Harry&rsquo;s lips are much softer than Tilly had ever imagined, hers the tiniest bit sticky with the lip gloss that had managed to stay on throughout the night&rsquo;s dramas.</p><p>Pulling away, the two teenagers can&rsquo;t help but let bashful grins form on their faces, chuckling at what they had just done. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;d argue this was a pretty perfect birthday after all.&rdquo; Tilly giggles and Harry decides then and there that it&rsquo;s his favourite sound.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday.&rdquo; He presses a warm kiss to her cheek, moving his arms to wind back around her waist and laying his head into the crook of her neck, effectively embracing her in the most tender hug he thinks he&rsquo;s every given anyone (except his mom of course). Rising back up on her toes slightly, Tilly wraps her arms around Harry&rsquo;s neck, pressing her body further into his and returning the embrace.</p><p>A sudden realization dawns on her, &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Brows furrowed, she pulls away from Harry to only then realize she isn&rsquo;t wearing a watch.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh,&rdquo; Checking his watch, Harry struggles to read it and angles it better against the faint light of the street lamp near them before saying, &ldquo;Eleven-thirty-three, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>Eyes wide, Tilly takes a deep breath in, &ldquo;My curfew is 12, if I&rsquo;m not home by then my parents will <i>flip</i>.&rdquo; Her hands absentmindedly move to fiddle with the rings on Harry&rsquo;s watch-free hand. He&rsquo;s a little amused if he&rsquo;s honest, seeing her fidgety over possibly missing curfew. But he&rsquo;d never purposefully get her in trouble, knowing she&rsquo;s a little bit of a goody-two-shoes and would be super mad if she got grounded. (Which also meant Harry wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see her outside of school but he&rsquo;ll keep that to himself.)</p><p>&ldquo;Relax, it&rsquo;s only 15 minutes drive from here, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He pulls her by hand to the passenger side of the car and like a true gentleman, opens the door and makes sure her legs are tucked in before shutting it.</p><p>True to his word, 15 minutes later Harry pulls up to Tilly&rsquo;s kerb, shifting the car into park with 5 minutes to spare according to the clock on the dash.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Harry.&rdquo; She turns sideways in the seat to face him and that&rsquo;s when Harry can see the day catching up to her, her eyes heavy with sleep yet still glimmering. He chuckles, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already said that.&rdquo;</p><p>Pushing against the centre console, Tilly reaches across to press a final kiss to Harry&rsquo;s cheek, unintentionally right next to the corner of his mouth making him smile in admiration. &ldquo;Goodnight, Harry.&rdquo; Her voice is soft.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Tilly.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry watches as she walks up the stone path to her front door and after ensuring she&rsquo;s safely inside, shifts the car into drive and heads home, no doubt to stay up thinking about how crazy she makes him. In a good way, of course.</p>",

So I wrote this with the intention of it being set in 1977, although I don&rsquo;t think I did a fantastic job of conveying that (I tried ok) so it&rsquo;s pretty easy to just imagine it however you&rsquo;d like! ALSO I wrote this both on my laptop and my phone where the spell check/grammar check is different so please excuse any switches between british spelling and american spelling. Please let me know what you think, I&rsquo;d really appreciate it. Hope you like it!) </p>\n<p>&ndash;</p>\n<p>December 1st, 1977. Tilly&rsquo;s 17th Birthday. It would be like most days if not for the crazy amount of balloons and streamers decorating the living room, where she sits in her pyjamas carefully unwrapping the bow tied around the box in her lap. Tilly&rsquo;s never been one to worry too much over her birthday, her parents however (more specifically her Mother), have always made a fuss over the day despite her constant re-assurance that she&rsquo;s just happy with homemade cupcakes and a new pair of bell bottoms.</p>\n<p>Her parents had woken her up especially early so she could see the decorations and be wished a proper happy birthday before shuffling off to school. Tilly has always appreciated her Mother&rsquo;s efforts when it comes to special occasions and finds it quite comical that her Father agrees with all her decor decisions, despite not caring for the over-the-top-ness of it all.</p>\n</p>",
