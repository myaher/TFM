Here is another request I have completed for the wonderful @tomesandrosebud. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about how this one turned out and I feel like it\u2019s a little bit shite, but my writer&rsquo;s block is worse than ever and something is way better than nothing. Please keep the requests coming as I have literally no ideas of my own! Moose :)</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\u201cHey, thank you for coming. Please come in\u201d Dan welcomed you, stepping to the side of the front door, letting you into his apartment.</p><p>\u201cNo worries at all. Nice to meet you, I\u2019m Y/N\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan. So how do you know Mary?\u201d He asked, leading you to his bedroom where the piano was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a student of hers as well. I\u2019ve known her since I was 19 years old after I moved to England and she\u2019s been my piano teacher since. I\u2019m honoured she\u2019s recommended me actually\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought you weren\u2019t from here. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re from America?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You chuckled, \u201cDid the accent give it away? Yeah, I\u2019m American. I had to move here after some family issues. It&rsquo;s not all bad over here\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, you have your work cut out now. I\u2019m not very fancy\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an issue\u201d you laughed, \u201cWe all start somewhere. Oh gosh, this is gorgeous. Where did you get it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAntique shop. It does the job\u201d he shrugged, remembering finding the piano in the local antique shop near his parents.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo how did you get on with Mary?\u201d You asked, taking a seat in the chair Dan had set up next to the piano stool.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, we were working on this piece here\u201d he replied, getting a piece of sheet music from behind the stack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh! <i>Comptine d`un autre \u00e9t\u00e9</i>! This was the first piece I did with Mary\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely piece\u2026I get the melody but I am struggling with the rhythm\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo worries, that\u2019s what everyone struggles with on this piece. Let\u2019s start then. Just play it how you usually would and I\u2019ll help you along the way\u201d\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>The two of you continued to laugh and play - Dan was surprisingly good at the piano, and he was clearly more advanced than you first anticipated. Your hour soon came to an end, and Dan was just showing you out the door when it opened suddenly, making you jump.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my - I am so sorry\u201d you laughed, placing your hand on your heart.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault, I\u2019m really sorry\u201d Phil laughed, shuffling past you into the hallway, \u201cI\u2019m Phil, by the way. Dan\u2019s roommate\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, Dan\u2019s new piano teacher\u201d you smiled, feeling yourself blush slightly at his bright smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLovely to meet you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. You too\u201d you smiled back, the two of you staring at each other contently for a minute, making Dan feel very awkward.\u00a0</p><p>Dan cleared his throat, \u201cWell, I will see you next week then Y/N?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes. See you next week, Dan. See you Phil\u201d you waved, quickly rushing out of the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow. She\u2019s a bit different to Mary, isn\u2019t she Dan?\u201d Phil asked, still staring at the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s insane. She\u2019s younger than me, so talented and she is nothing like evil Bloody Mary\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd she comes every week?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEvery Friday at 10\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so pretty,\u201d Phil said, clearly not have recognising that he said it out loud.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan laughed, looking at Phil quizzically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I just say that out loud?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan just laughed and walked away to continue editing the latest gaming channel video.\u00a0</p><p>You returned each Friday for your weekly piano session with Dan, teaching him new techniques and pieces and really helping him improve and each week, Phil would always manage to find a way to speak to you, even if it was only a quick hello.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell done today, Dan. You are really improving\u2026so much so that you may even be better than me by the end of the year\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u201d you heard a voice behind you, \u201cNo one is better than you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You turned around to find Phil, who quickly broke eye contact with you and awkwardly coughed, \u201cAt piano. You\u2019re amazing at piano. No one is better at piano than you.\u201d</p><p>You laughed awkwardly, \u201cThank you, Phil\u2026that\u2019s very sweet of you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You walked past him and head towards the door, Dan following behind you but stopped to slap Phil behind the head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely pathetic, you know that? Ask her if she wants to stay for coffee or something\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas it really that bad?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, you came across as a weird, creepy, old man, stalker! \u2018<i>No one is better than you\u2019?\u00a0 </i>Really? Go on, ask her out like a normal person\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI recovered\u201d Phil mumbled as he headed towards the front door where you were collecting your coat.</p><p>\u201cRecovered\u201d Dan scoffed, shaking his head as he followed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Phil called to you as you were doing your shoe lace up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Phil?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI - We\u2026we were wondering if you would like to stay for a coffee?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, I would absolutely love to but unfortunately I have another lesson. I get to go and teach this lovely little boy called James. Reminds me a lot of Dan actually\u201d you laughed, pulling your bag up your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s middle name is James\u201d Phil blurted out, not entirely sure why he shared that information.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026great\u201d you nodded, smiling politely as Phil awkwardly stood in front of you, \u201cwell, I should get going now\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh of course, yes. Sorry. I\u2019ll move\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks. Good work today, Dan and I\u2019ll see you two next week\u201d you waved, springing down the steps of their apartment block to the front door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBye Y/N!\u201d Dan shouted, looking at Phil and singling that they should go after you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do I say?\u201d Phil hissed, cautious that he may be too late.</p><p>\u201cJust ask her out for god sake! GO!\u201d Dan pushed him out the front door, and Phil rushed down the stairs to find you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Turning around, you saw Phil burst through the front door of his apartment block, \u201cHey Phil\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I um\u2026I was wondering if\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You urged him on, sensing that he was struggling to get the words out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you would like to\u2026go out with me sometime?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You smiled and nodded, \u201cSure. Hows Friday at 8? We could go to the bar down the street from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing. Yes. Thank you\u201d Phil smiled, nodding furiously.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d you chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday\u201d</p><p>Phil waved as you walked towards your car, \u201cFriday\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWoah, looks at you. Someone\u2019s fancy\u201d Dan whistled as he walked into Phil\u2019s room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAm I overdressed?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou sound panicked\u201d Dan laughed, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe bar down the road\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen yes. A bit overdressed. Lose the tie. And the suit jacket. And the white shirt.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get changed completely, Dan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo and shower, your hair is greasy. I\u2019ll get an outfit together for you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil scoffed, \u201cHow would you know what would impress Y/N?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, she\u2019s my friend. I know I don\u2019t have a lot of those, but Y/N is actually one of them. Go\u201d Dan shoved him out the room, before heading towards the wardrobe.\u00a0</p><p>Dan went through the entirety of Phil\u2019s wardrobe as he was in the shower, cringing at some of the items he pulled out the drawers. Eventually, he settles on a pair of black, ripped jeans with a dark blue, flannel shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you pick out for me, mum?\u201d Phil asked, walking into his bedroom with a towel around his waist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha. I picked out something simple, but not too casual\u201d</p><p>Phil inspected the clothes laid out on his bed, nodding in silent agreement. Dan took this as his approval and took a deep breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to edit a video. Be back by midnight and don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t leave the house\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan paused, gasping as he clutched his chest, \u201cOuch, Phillip Lester. That hurt\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out, I need to get dressed\u201d Phil laughed, chucking a pair of socks at his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going! I\u2019m going!\u201d He surrendered, laughing as he left the room.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Phil bounced his knee in anticipation, his eyes fixed on the door in fear that you would never turn up. To his relief, you eventually turned up. He thought you looked beautiful in your blue jeans and an off the shoulder chiffon blouse, your hair slightly wet from the rain outside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He called over to you over the noise fo the bar, noticing you look around the bar for him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, sorry I\u2019m late.

What can I get you to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeach Bellini Mocktail please,\u201d you asked the bartender, who nodded his head in acknowledgement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo alcohol?\u201d Phil questioned, taking a drink from his G&amp;T.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, no.

They would drink pure alcohol if they could. Anything with alcohol in, they would drink it. Which, in turn, made them quite violent\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why you moved over here when you were younger?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan. He said you moved from America when you were 19\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2026I had to. I was so sick of being treated so badly by the only two people in my life that I had to leave. I had tried to move in with my friends and even move states, but I was too close to my parents. I had to get off the grid completely so\u2026London it was\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane. All by yourself?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll by myself\u201d you nodded, smiling contently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so brave. You\u2019ve done so well for yourself\u201d \u2018</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you laughed, \u201cI certainly like to think so\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do\u201d Phil smiled, looking at you sympathetically for a moment before quickly reverting his attention back to his drink, \u201cLet\u2019s change the subject\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s. I would be nice to know the basics before we delve back into the deep stuff\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cI agree\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two of you talked and laughed into the night, being some of the only few left in the bar at 11:30. You had learnt about Phil\u2019s career and how he met with Dan, and how he came out as bi-sexual, whereas he learnt about your love for the piano and your time in America and your struggles with your parents.\u00a0</p><p>When you finally realised the time, you gasped, \u201cWe\u2019ve been here ages!\u201d</p><p>Phil looked at his phone and laughed, \u201cseems we have\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should really be getting back but I really don\u2019t want to go.

Just so we can decide what to do? I hear there\u2019s a fair in town next week?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSounds good\u201d you said, handing him your phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll see you next week\u201d He smiled, kissing your cheek as you both left the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFriday\u201d you repeated, embracing him before heading off towards your car, waving as you pulled out the car park.\u00a0</p><p>Phil took a deep breath, smiling widely as he turned around and headed back to the apartment, his hands deep in his coat pockets to protect them from the cold, a single word replaying in his head as he thought about the night he had with you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFriday\u201d</p>",

Your hour soon came to an end, and Dan was just showing you out the door when it opened suddenly, making you jump.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my - I am so sorry\u201d you laughed, placing your hand on your heart.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault, I\u2019m really sorry\u201d Phil laughed, shuffling past you into the hallway, \u201cI\u2019m Phil, by the way.

Yes. See you next week, Dan. See you Phil\u201d you waved, quickly rushing out of the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow. She\u2019s a bit different to Mary, isn\u2019t she Dan?\u201d Phil asked, still staring at the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s insane. She\u2019s younger than me, so talented and she is nothing like evil Bloody Mary\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd she comes every week?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEvery Friday at 10\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so pretty,\u201d Phil said, clearly not have recognising that he said it out loud.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan laughed, looking at Phil quizzically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I just say that out loud?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan just laughed and walked away to continue editing the latest gaming channel video.\u00a0</p><p>You returned each Friday for your weekly piano session with Dan, teaching him new techniques and pieces and really helping him improve and each week, Phil would always manage to find a way to speak to you, even if it was only a quick hello.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell done today, Dan. You are really improving\u2026so much so that you may even be better than me by the end of the year\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u201d you heard a voice behind you, \u201cNo one is better than you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You turned around to find Phil, who quickly broke eye contact with you and awkwardly coughed, \u201cAt piano. You\u2019re amazing at piano. No one is better at piano than you.\u201d</p><p>You laughed awkwardly, \u201cThank you, Phil\u2026that\u2019s very sweet of you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You walked past him and head towards the door, Dan following behind you but stopped to slap Phil behind the head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely pathetic, you know that?

GO!\u201d Dan pushed him out the front door, and Phil rushed down the stairs to find you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Turning around, you saw Phil burst through the front door of his apartment block, \u201cHey Phil\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I um\u2026I was wondering if\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You urged him on, sensing that he was struggling to get the words out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you would like to\u2026go out with me sometime?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You smiled and nodded, \u201cSure. Hows Friday at 8? We could go to the bar down the street from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing. Yes. Thank you\u201d Phil smiled, nodding furiously.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d you chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday\u201d</p><p>Phil waved as you walked towards your car, \u201cFriday\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWoah, looks at you.

A bit overdressed. Lose the tie. And the suit jacket. And the white shirt.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get changed completely, Dan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo and shower, your hair is greasy. I\u2019ll get an outfit together for you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil scoffed, \u201cHow would you know what would impress Y/N?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, she\u2019s my friend. I know I don\u2019t have a lot of those, but Y/N is actually one of them. Go\u201d Dan shoved him out the room, before heading towards the wardrobe.\u00a0</p><p>Dan went through the entirety of Phil\u2019s wardrobe as he was in the shower, cringing at some of the items he pulled out the drawers. Eventually, he settles on a pair of black, ripped jeans with a dark blue, flannel shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you pick out for me, mum?\u201d Phil asked, walking into his bedroom with a towel around his waist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha. I picked out something simple, but not too casual\u201d</p><p>Phil inspected the clothes laid out on his bed, nodding in silent agreement. Dan took this as his approval and took a deep breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to edit a video. Be back by midnight and don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t leave the house\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan paused, gasping as he clutched his chest, \u201cOuch, Phillip Lester. That hurt\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out, I need to get dressed\u201d Phil laughed, chucking a pair of socks at his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going! I\u2019m going!\u201d He surrendered, laughing as he left the room.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Phil bounced his knee in anticipation, his eyes fixed on the door in fear that you would never turn up. To his relief, you eventually turned up. He thought you looked beautiful in your blue jeans and an off the shoulder chiffon blouse, your hair slightly wet from the rain outside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He called over to you over the noise fo the bar, noticing you look around the bar for him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, sorry I\u2019m late.

Please come in\u201d Dan welcomed you, stepping to the side of the front door, letting you into his apartment.</p><p>\u201cNo worries at all. Nice to meet you, I\u2019m Y/N\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan. So how do you know Mary?\u201d He asked, leading you to his bedroom where the piano was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a student of hers as well. I\u2019ve known her since I was 19 years old after I moved to England and she\u2019s been my piano teacher since. I\u2019m honoured she\u2019s recommended me actually\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought you weren\u2019t from here. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re from America?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You chuckled, \u201cDid the accent give it away? Yeah, I\u2019m American. I had to move here after some family issues. It\u2019s not all bad over here\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, you have your work cut out now. I\u2019m not very fancy\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an issue\u201d you laughed, \u201cWe all start somewhere. Oh gosh, this is gorgeous. Where did you get it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAntique shop. It does the job\u201d he shrugged, remembering finding the piano in the local antique shop near his parents.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo how did you get on with Mary?\u201d You asked, taking a seat in the chair Dan had set up next to the piano stool.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, we were working on this piece here\u201d he replied, getting a piece of sheet music from behind the stack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh! <i>Comptine d`un autre \u00e9t\u00e9</i>! This was the first piece I did with Mary\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely piece\u2026I get the melody but I am struggling with the rhythm\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo worries, that\u2019s what everyone struggles with on this piece. Let\u2019s start then. Just play it how you usually would and I\u2019ll help you along the way\u201d\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>The two of you continued to laugh and play - Dan was surprisingly good at the piano, and he was clearly more advanced than you first anticipated. Your hour soon came to an end, and Dan was just showing you out the door when it opened suddenly, making you jump.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my - I am so sorry\u201d you laughed, placing your hand on your heart.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault, I\u2019m really sorry\u201d Phil laughed, shuffling past you into the hallway, \u201cI\u2019m Phil, by the way. Dan\u2019s roommate\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, Dan\u2019s new piano teacher\u201d you smiled, feeling yourself blush slightly at his bright smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLovely to meet you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. You too\u201d you smiled back, the two of you staring at each other contently for a minute, making Dan feel very awkward.\u00a0</p><p>Dan cleared his throat, \u201cWell, I will see you next week then Y/N?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes. See you next week, Dan. See you Phil\u201d you waved, quickly rushing out of the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow. She\u2019s a bit different to Mary, isn\u2019t she Dan?\u201d Phil asked, still staring at the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s insane. She\u2019s younger than me, so talented and she is nothing like evil Bloody Mary\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd she comes every week?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEvery Friday at 10\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so pretty,\u201d Phil said, clearly not have recognising that he said it out loud.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan laughed, looking at Phil quizzically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I just say that out loud?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan just laughed and walked away to continue editing the latest gaming channel video.\u00a0</p><p>You returned each Friday for your weekly piano session with Dan, teaching him new techniques and pieces and really helping him improve and each week, Phil would always manage to find a way to speak to you, even if it was only a quick hello.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell done today, Dan. You are really improving\u2026so much so that you may even be better than me by the end of the year\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u201d you heard a voice behind you, \u201cNo one is better than you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You turned around to find Phil, who quickly broke eye contact with you and awkwardly coughed, \u201cAt piano. You\u2019re amazing at piano. No one is better at piano than you.\u201d</p><p>You laughed awkwardly, \u201cThank you, Phil\u2026that\u2019s very sweet of you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You walked past him and head towards the door, Dan following behind you but stopped to slap Phil behind the head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely pathetic, you know that? Ask her if she wants to stay for coffee or something\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas it really that bad?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude, you came across as a weird, creepy, old man, stalker! \u2018<i>No one is better than you\u2019?\u00a0 </i>Really? Go on, ask her out like a normal person\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI recovered\u201d Phil mumbled as he headed towards the front door where you were collecting your coat.</p><p>\u201cRecovered\u201d Dan scoffed, shaking his head as he followed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Phil called to you as you were doing your shoe lace up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Phil?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI - We\u2026we were wondering if you would like to stay for a coffee?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, I would absolutely love to but unfortunately I have another lesson. I get to go and teach this lovely little boy called James. Reminds me a lot of Dan actually\u201d you laughed, pulling your bag up your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s middle name is James\u201d Phil blurted out, not entirely sure why he shared that information.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026great\u201d you nodded, smiling politely as Phil awkwardly stood in front of you, \u201cwell, I should get going now\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh of course, yes. Sorry. I\u2019ll move\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks. Good work today, Dan and I\u2019ll see you two next week\u201d you waved, springing down the steps of their apartment block to the front door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBye Y/N!\u201d Dan shouted, looking at Phil and singling that they should go after you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do I say?\u201d Phil hissed, cautious that he may be too late.</p><p>\u201cJust ask her out for god sake! GO!\u201d Dan pushed him out the front door, and Phil rushed down the stairs to find you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Turning around, you saw Phil burst through the front door of his apartment block, \u201cHey Phil\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I um\u2026I was wondering if\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You urged him on, sensing that he was struggling to get the words out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you would like to\u2026go out with me sometime?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You smiled and nodded, \u201cSure. Hows Friday at 8? We could go to the bar down the street from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing. Yes. Thank you\u201d Phil smiled, nodding furiously.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d you chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday\u201d</p><p>Phil waved as you walked towards your car, \u201cFriday\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWoah, looks at you. Someone\u2019s fancy\u201d Dan whistled as he walked into Phil\u2019s room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAm I overdressed?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou sound panicked\u201d Dan laughed, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe bar down the road\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen yes. A bit overdressed. Lose the tie. And the suit jacket. And the white shirt.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get changed completely, Dan?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo and shower, your hair is greasy. I\u2019ll get an outfit together for you\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil scoffed, \u201cHow would you know what would impress Y/N?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, she\u2019s my friend. I know I don\u2019t have a lot of those, but Y/N is actually one of them. Go\u201d Dan shoved him out the room, before heading towards the wardrobe.\u00a0</p><p>Dan went through the entirety of Phil\u2019s wardrobe as he was in the shower, cringing at some of the items he pulled out the drawers. Eventually, he settles on a pair of black, ripped jeans with a dark blue, flannel shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you pick out for me, mum?\u201d Phil asked, walking into his bedroom with a towel around his waist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha. I picked out something simple, but not too casual\u201d</p><p>Phil inspected the clothes laid out on his bed, nodding in silent agreement. Dan took this as his approval and took a deep breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to edit a video. Be back by midnight and don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t leave the house\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan paused, gasping as he clutched his chest, \u201cOuch, Phillip Lester. That hurt\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out, I need to get dressed\u201d Phil laughed, chucking a pair of socks at his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going! I\u2019m going!\u201d He surrendered, laughing as he left the room.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Phil bounced his knee in anticipation, his eyes fixed on the door in fear that you would never turn up. To his relief, you eventually turned up. He thought you looked beautiful in your blue jeans and an off the shoulder chiffon blouse, your hair slightly wet from the rain outside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He called over to you over the noise fo the bar, noticing you look around the bar for him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, sorry I\u2019m late. My last lesson over-ran slightly\u201d you apologised, placing your bag at your feet as you sat down on the bar stool next to Phil.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok. What can I get you to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeach Bellini Mocktail please,\u201d you asked the bartender, who nodded his head in acknowledgement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo alcohol?\u201d Phil questioned, taking a drink from his G&amp;T.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t drink\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I ask why?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to hear about that this early on\u201d you laughed nervously, smiling at the bartender in thanks as he handed you your drink.</p><p>\u201cI can handle it\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sighed, taking a sip from your drink before setting it down and looking at Phil, \u201cMy parents were very, very fond of alcohol. They would drink pure alcohol if they could. Anything with alcohol in, they would drink it. Which, in turn, made them quite violent\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why you moved over here when you were younger?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan. He said you moved from America when you were 19\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2026I had to. I was so sick of being treated so badly by the only two people in my life that I had to leave. I had tried to move in with my friends and even move states, but I was too close to my parents. I had to get off the grid completely so\u2026London it was\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane. All by yourself?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll by myself\u201d you nodded, smiling contently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so brave. You\u2019ve done so well for yourself\u201d \u2018</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you laughed, \u201cI certainly like to think so\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do\u201d Phil smiled, looking at you sympathetically for a moment before quickly reverting his attention back to his drink, \u201cLet\u2019s change the subject\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s. I would be nice to know the basics before we delve back into the deep stuff\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil laughed, \u201cI agree\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The two of you talked and laughed into the night, being some of the only few left in the bar at 11:30. You had learnt about Phil\u2019s career and how he met with Dan, and how he came out as bi-sexual, whereas he learnt about your love for the piano and your time in America and your struggles with your parents.\u00a0</p><p>When you finally realised the time, you gasped, \u201cWe\u2019ve been here ages!\u201d</p><p>Phil looked at his phone and laughed, \u201cseems we have\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should really be getting back but I really don\u2019t want to go. This is the most fun I\u2019ve had in years!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could do this again next week?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You giggled and nodded your head, \u201cSounds good\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I get your number? Just so we can decide what to do? I hear there\u2019s a fair in town next week?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSounds good\u201d you said, handing him your phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll see you next week\u201d He smiled, kissing your cheek as you both left the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFriday\u201d you repeated, embracing him before heading off towards your car, waving as you pulled out the car park.\u00a0</p><p>Phil took a deep breath, smiling widely as he turned around and headed back to the apartment, his hands deep in his coat pockets to protect them from the cold, a single word replaying in his head as he thought about the night he had with you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFriday\u201d</p></p>",

Your hour soon came to an end, and Dan was just showing you out the door when it opened suddenly, making you jump.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my - I am so sorry&rdquo; you laughed, placing your hand on your heart.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was my fault, I&rsquo;m really sorry&rdquo; Phil laughed, shuffling past you into the hallway, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Phil, by the way. Dan&rsquo;s roommate&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N, Dan&rsquo;s new piano teacher&rdquo; you smiled, feeling yourself blush slightly at his bright smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Lovely to meet you&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. You too&rdquo; you smiled back, the two of you staring at each other contently for a minute, making Dan feel very awkward.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan cleared his throat, &ldquo;Well, I will see you next week then Y/N?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes. See you next week, Dan. See you Phil&rdquo; you waved, quickly rushing out of the door.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow. She&rsquo;s a bit different to Mary, isn&rsquo;t she Dan?&rdquo; Phil asked, still staring at the door.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s insane. She&rsquo;s younger than me, so talented and she is nothing like evil Bloody Mary&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And she comes every week?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Every Friday at 10&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so pretty,&rdquo; Phil said, clearly not have recognising that he said it out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan laughed, looking at Phil quizzically.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I just say that out loud?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan just laughed and walked away to continue editing the latest gaming channel video.&nbsp;</p><p>You returned each Friday for your weekly piano session with Dan, teaching him new techniques and pieces and really helping him improve and each week, Phil would always manage to find a way to speak to you, even if it was only a quick hello.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well done today, Dan. You are really improving&hellip;so much so that you may even be better than me by the end of the year&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible&rdquo; you heard a voice behind you, &ldquo;No one is better than you&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You turned around to find Phil, who quickly broke eye contact with you and awkwardly coughed, &ldquo;At piano. You&rsquo;re amazing at piano. No one is better at piano than you.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed awkwardly, &ldquo;Thank you, Phil&hellip;that&rsquo;s very sweet of you&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You walked past him and head towards the door, Dan following behind you but stopped to slap Phil behind the head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely pathetic, you know that? Ask her if she wants to stay for coffee or something&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Was it really that bad?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, you came across as a weird, creepy, old man, stalker! &lsquo;<i>No one is better than you&rsquo;?&nbsp; </i>Really? Go on, ask her out like a normal person&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I recovered&rdquo; Phil mumbled as he headed towards the front door where you were collecting your coat.</p><p>&ldquo;Recovered&rdquo; Dan scoffed, shaking his head as he followed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; Phil called to you as you were doing your shoe lace up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Phil?&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I - We&hellip;we were wondering if you would like to stay for a coffee?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I would absolutely love to but unfortunately I have another lesson. I get to go and teach this lovely little boy called James. Reminds me a lot of Dan actually&rdquo; you laughed, pulling your bag up your shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s middle name is James&rdquo; Phil blurted out, not entirely sure why he shared that information.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;great&rdquo; you nodded, smiling politely as Phil awkwardly stood in front of you, &ldquo;well, I should get going now&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh of course, yes. Sorry. I&rsquo;ll move&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. Good work today, Dan and I&rsquo;ll see you two next week&rdquo; you waved, springing down the steps of their apartment block to the front door.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Y/N!&rdquo; Dan shouted, looking at Phil and singling that they should go after you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I say?&rdquo; Phil hissed, cautious that he may be too late.</p><p>&ldquo;Just ask her out for god sake! GO!&rdquo; Dan pushed him out the front door, and Phil rushed down the stairs to find you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Turning around, you saw Phil burst through the front door of his apartment block, &ldquo;Hey Phil&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, I um&hellip;I was wondering if&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; You urged him on, sensing that he was struggling to get the words out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If you would like to&hellip;go out with me sometime?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You smiled and nodded, &ldquo;Sure. Hows Friday at 8? We could go to the bar down the street from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amazing. Yes. Thank you&rdquo; Phil smiled, nodding furiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&rdquo; you chuckled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you Friday&rdquo;</p><p>Phil waved as you walked towards your car, &ldquo;Friday&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, looks at you. Someone&rsquo;s fancy&rdquo; Dan whistled as he walked into Phil&rsquo;s room.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I overdressed?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You sound panicked&rdquo; Dan laughed, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The bar down the road&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Then yes. A bit overdressed. Lose the tie. And the suit jacket. And the white shirt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to get changed completely, Dan?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go and shower, your hair is greasy. I&rsquo;ll get an outfit together for you&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil scoffed, &ldquo;How would you know what would impress Y/N?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Surprisingly, she&rsquo;s my friend. I know I don&rsquo;t have a lot of those, but Y/N is actually one of them. Go&rdquo; Dan shoved him out the room, before heading towards the wardrobe.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan went through the entirety of Phil&rsquo;s wardrobe as he was in the shower, cringing at some of the items he pulled out the drawers. Eventually, he settles on a pair of black, ripped jeans with a dark blue, flannel shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you pick out for me, mum?&rdquo; Phil asked, walking into his bedroom with a towel around his waist.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha. Ha. I picked out something simple, but not too casual&rdquo;</p><p>Phil inspected the clothes laid out on his bed, nodding in silent agreement. Dan took this as his approval and took a deep breath.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to edit a video. Be back by midnight and don&rsquo;t do anything I wouldn&rsquo;t do&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So I shouldn&rsquo;t leave the house&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan paused, gasping as he clutched his chest, &ldquo;Ouch, Phillip Lester. That hurt&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out, I need to get dressed&rdquo; Phil laughed, chucking a pair of socks at his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going! I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo; He surrendered, laughing as he left the room.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Phil bounced his knee in anticipation, his eyes fixed on the door in fear that you would never turn up. To his relief, you eventually turned up. He thought you looked beautiful in your blue jeans and an off the shoulder chiffon blouse, your hair slightly wet from the rain outside.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; He called over to you over the noise fo the bar, noticing you look around the bar for him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sorry I&rsquo;m late. My last lesson over-ran slightly&rdquo; you apologised, placing your bag at your feet as you sat down on the bar stool next to Phil.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. What can I get you to drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peach Bellini Mocktail please,&rdquo; you asked the bartender, who nodded his head in acknowledgement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No alcohol?&rdquo; Phil questioned, taking a drink from his G&amp;T.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I don&rsquo;t drink&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask why?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you want to hear about that this early on&rdquo; you laughed nervously, smiling at the bartender in thanks as he handed you your drink.</p><p>&ldquo;I can handle it&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You sighed, taking a sip from your drink before setting it down and looking at Phil, &ldquo;My parents were very, very fond of alcohol. They would drink pure alcohol if they could. Anything with alcohol in, they would drink it. Which, in turn, made them quite violent&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that why you moved over here when you were younger?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you-&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan. He said you moved from America when you were 19&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&hellip;I had to. I was so sick of being treated so badly by the only two people in my life that I had to leave. I had tried to move in with my friends and even move states, but I was too close to my parents. I had to get off the grid completely so&hellip;London it was&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s insane. All by yourself?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;All by myself&rdquo; you nodded, smiling contently.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so brave. You&rsquo;ve done so well for yourself&rdquo; &lsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you laughed, &ldquo;I certainly like to think so&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I do&rdquo; Phil smiled, looking at you sympathetically for a moment before quickly reverting his attention back to his drink, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s change the subject&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s. I would be nice to know the basics before we delve back into the deep stuff&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil laughed, &ldquo;I agree&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The two of you talked and laughed into the night, being some of the only few left in the bar at 11:30. You had learnt about Phil&rsquo;s career and how he met with Dan, and how he came out as bi-sexual, whereas he learnt about your love for the piano and your time in America and your struggles with your parents.&nbsp;</p><p>When you finally realised the time, you gasped, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here ages!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looked at his phone and laughed, &ldquo;seems we have&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should really be getting back but I really don&rsquo;t want to go. This is the most fun I&rsquo;ve had in years!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We could do this again next week?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You giggled and nodded your head, &ldquo;Sounds good&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could I get your number? Just so we can decide what to do? I hear there&rsquo;s a fair in town next week?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good&rdquo; you said, handing him your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Great. I&rsquo;ll see you next week&rdquo; He smiled, kissing your cheek as you both left the bar.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Friday&rdquo; you repeated, embracing him before heading off towards your car, waving as you pulled out the car park.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil took a deep breath, smiling widely as he turned around and headed back to the apartment, his hands deep in his coat pockets to protect them from the cold, a single word replaying in his head as he thought about the night he had with you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Friday&rdquo;</p></p>",

Here is another request I have completed for the wonderful @tomesandrosebud. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about how this one turned out and I feel like it&rsquo;s a little bit shite, but my writer&rsquo;s block is worse than ever and something is way better than nothing. Please keep the requests coming as I have literally no ideas of my own! Moose :)</p>\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, thank you for coming. Please come in&rdquo; Dan welcomed you, stepping to the side of the front door, letting you into his apartment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No worries at all. Nice to meet you, I&rsquo;m Y/N&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dan. So how do you know Mary?&rdquo; He asked, leading you to his bedroom where the piano was.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a student of hers as well. I&rsquo;ve known her since I was 19 years old after I moved to England and she&rsquo;s been my piano teacher since. I&rsquo;m honoured she&rsquo;s recommended me actually&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought you weren&rsquo;t from here. I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re from America?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You chuckled, &ldquo;Did the accent give it away? Yeah, I&rsquo;m American. I had to move here after some family issues. It&rsquo;s not all bad over here&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you have your work cut out now. I&rsquo;m not very fancy&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an issue&rdquo; you laughed, &ldquo;We all start somewhere. Oh gosh, this is gorgeous. Where did you get it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Antique shop. It does the job&rdquo; he shrugged, remembering finding the piano in the local antique shop near his parents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So how did you get on with Mary?&rdquo; You asked, taking a seat in the chair Dan had set up next to the piano stool.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, we were working on this piece here&rdquo; he replied, getting a piece of sheet music from behind the stack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>Comptine d`un autre &eacute;t&eacute;</i>! This was the first piece I did with Mary&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely piece&hellip;I get the melody but I am struggling with the rhythm&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No worries, that&rsquo;s what everyone struggles with on this piece. Let&rsquo;s start then. Just play it how you usually would and I&rsquo;ll help you along the way&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
