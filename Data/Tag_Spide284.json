(I don\u2019t think that was exclusive to the Disney cartoon.)</p><p>(If you can\ndeal with her being a mother and a superhero, sometimes both at the same time, you can deal with her not being a\nmodel/actress in every iteration there is for her). </p><p>It certainly is more <b>convenient</b> for the game\u2019s narrative. (it\u2019s akin to the 2016\u00a0<i>Frequency</i>\u00a0remake\nmaking Frank Sullivan a police officer versus a fireman who clumsily detective\u2019ed his way through a serial killer case). I\nlike the switch, especially since Peter (in this iteration of his story) is\nmore scientist than he is reporter. (But, I also like Peter telling Mary Jane\nthe truth in USM, so you know where I stand in general, I guess.)\u00a0</p><p>Insomniac\u2019s writing for Mary Jane for the most part, is fairly solid, but there are times where it\u2019s pretty\u2026 irresponsible (for lack of a better word). That, or just\nreally inconsistent for the sake of \u201ccharacter does things because plot\u201d.\u00a0 I like reporter Mary Jane, what I\u2019m not crazy about, I guess, is that making her a reporter for the Daily Bugle seems, not at all inspired by other canon material, but a tried and true argument that has become pretty disingenuous over the years.\n\n</p><hr><p>For the most part, a lot of the writing early on in the game\nnever presents Mary Jane or Peter Parker\u2019s relationship as one where Peter is\noverprotective or dismissive of her journalistic efforts. Hell, he doesn\u2019t even\ntalk down to her when she decides to jump into situation wherein she could be\nhurt. He just expresses his worry.</p><p>Her introduction, for instance, wherein she is trying to\nexpose Fisk for stealing (?) historical art pieces and selling them off as legit purchases,\ndemonstrates nothing but complete trust between the two characters, especially\nwith regard to what she can and cannot do. Mary Jane can sneak up on a guy and\nknock him out (when he\u2019s distracted), as long as there aren\u2019t other men\naround that can kill her the next second.</p><p>Mary Jane knows she can\u2019t fight or even handle the Martin\nLi\u2019s \u201cDemon gang\u201d, so she removes herself from the equation by hiding somewhere, and only ends up in\nthe middle of things when one of Li\u2019s henchmen is smart enough to do a thorough search\nof the exhibit she\u2019s in. Then Peter has to come and help her out.\u00a0</p><p>Afterward, a\nlot of Peter and Mary Jane\u2019s interaction highlights and centralizes her primary\nskill in this universe: investigation, digging things up, the thing that\u2019s kinda integral to her\njob at the Daily Bugle. It even demonstrates, for the most part, that her devil-may-care antics come with legal consequences (not that they appear lasting or impactful, but they\u2019re there). And, never once does she complain about having to look\nthings up, either for herself or for Peter \u2013 especially when they start working\non the same story (the \u201cDemon gang\u201d).</p><p>But, following Wilson Fisk\u2019s arrest and the introduction of\nMartin Li (Mr. Negative) as the antagonist, Mary Jane\u2019s attitude toward Peter\nbecomes questionably antagonistic. A lot of it is an artificial conflict so\nthat Peter and Mary Jane have something to fight about. (It\u2019s not enough that\ntheir not together because of issues with him being Spider-Man 80% of the time, as usual.)\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"450\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/797314468f9fcd1f9b1368317ac417a0/tumblr_inline_pf6om963dd1s8x54y_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"450\"/></figure><p>Mary\nJane starts taking what are, really, some seriously unnecessary risks to get\nanswers for questions she might\u2019ve uncovered by just talking to the persons in\nquestion or nosing into people\u2019s paper trails. Like, instead of stealth\nsegments, maybe we could\u2019ve gotten <i>L.A. Noir</i> type levels with Mary Jane trying\nto investigate crimes for articles. Hell, that would\u2019ve been a perfect excuse to use Yuri\nWatanabe more in the narrative outside of phone calls and brief cinematics, but\nI digress.</p><p>Instead, she goes straight into armed gunman territory to\nspeak to one of Osborn\u2019s aide\u2019s (around the same time Peter is), without\ntelling Peter about it. She nearly causes a scene by surprising said aide, and then again when Peter\ndrops in when rescues her from what he assumed was a mercenary working for Silver\nSable. She then proceeds to get mad at Peter for admonishing her actions, showing the slightest concern\nabout her decisions, and behaves as though\nPeter told her to stay out of the situation (when that never occurred).</p><p>She even goes as far as to say that the reason they broke up\n(in this universe) is because he was somehow impeding her career as a\njournalist, when the reason, as usual, seems to be she just got frustrated with\nhow much time he dedicated to being Spider-Man versus his interpersonal\nrelationships (which is why the narrative has him repeatedly emphasize that his\nwork with Doctor Octopus is the better time sink. He has time for a personal life, at the very least).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"655\" data-orig-height=\"368\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/28d02b0a59b809eb9e3568ed2f8c0468/tumblr_inline_pf6opefUqf1s8x54y_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"655\" data-orig-height=\"368\"/></figure><p>But, the narrative never treats her comments as though, out\nof frustration, she blindly assigned blame of their relationship problems on\nthe wrong issue (in this particular instance). It\u2019s a fact, despite Peter\u2019s protests to otherwise (which I\nguess are just wrong?).</p><p>The narrative paints this image that instead of doing what\nthey were doing in the introduction level, Peter has spent most of her career\nat the Bugle (and before that), telling her what she can and cannot investigate\nbased on the level of danger, when the most he\u2019s done is say, \u201cMary Jane this\nis dangerous. Did you really think this all the way through? Why didn\u2019t tell me\nabout this so I could help you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s this insistence from Mary Jane that\nthe two of them are partners or could be partners, but that partnership is based only on when its\nuseful for her, and then when she gets into a situation that actually requires\nhis help, she bristles when he points out she was acting recklessly then\nproceeds to give him the silent treatment.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6453dd0e9cd524d07dda941cde5be5ef/tumblr_inline_pf6p154SPE1s8x54y_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\"/></figure><p>And, obviously, the two finally sit down and talk. She\napologies for acting the way she does (after the Grand Central Station and F.E.A.S.T. shelter fire incident, anyway), and he apologizes for behaving in a way that gave her that impression, but the entire gist of the conversation\nis just set up so Mary Jane can say, \u201cI\u2019m always the one being saved, I just\nwanted to do the saving once\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>And it\u2019s here where you can hear the writer\u2019s\nvoice instead of hearing Mary Jane\u2019s voice.</p><hr><p><i>Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i> (especially the first volume) did a fairly solid job setting up\nand illustrating Mary Jane\u2019s frustration with being \u201cdamseled\u201d, primarily by\nhaving it connected to traumatizing events \u2013 like Ultimate Green Goblin tossing\nher off the Brooklyn Bridge, or being taken hostage by one of the Spider-Man\nclones, and dosed with experimental chemicals that turned her into a monster.</p><p>But, <i>Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i> also did a good job of either making Peter too caught up in his\nown dramas to notice her issues, or just being too late to help her and struggling\nfind a medium of empathetic and supportive, which could sometimes teeter into\noverprotective or insensitive. In both instances, Mary Jane\u2019s anger toward\nPeter and her circumstance can be justified by things within the narrative.<br/></p><p>There\u2019s nothing like that here in <i>Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man</i>. Mary Jane makes several side-eye comments like, \u201cNah, I\u2019m not gonna call Peter, he\u2019ll just tell me go home and sit at my laptop\u201d at different intervals of her stealth segments, and it\u2019s like,\u00a0\u201cUm, when did this occur, exactly?\u201d</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t already looking things up in the game\u2019s narrative (because a majority of your time with Mary Jane is talking to her on the phone and listening to her talk about what she found doing research), the two of them are not talking at all because she\u2019s not integral to that bit of the game\u2019s narrative.\u00a0</p><p>I know a lot of this is just an excuse or contrivance for gameplay. Mary Jane has to be thrown into the middle of a situation that anyone with common sense would avoid, so that the player can literally play as her.\u00a0But, as a result of these gameplay contrivances, you end up with disingenuous drama between Peter and Mary Jane.</p><p>(And the one time he actually tells her,\u00a0\u201cMary Jane stay back, I don\u2019t want to have to save you too!\u201d she\u2019s oddly noncommittal about how blunt that was, and stays back.)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"431\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53394b4c20c5a6bbe24d707463409164/tumblr_inline_pf6pxzd3mc1s8x54y_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"431\"/></figure><p>Insomniac has gone record with their opinion that <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/18/everything-we-know-about-mary-jane-watson-in-spider-man.aspx\">Mary Jane\nWatson is not much else than a damsel and that they wanted to change that</a>. But, their opinion seems entirely based on an era comic books she initially appeared in that haven\u2019t been relevant beyond historical reference.\u00a0</p><p>And for the most part, Mary Jane\u2019s role in the 60s era <i>Spider-Man</i> comics were brief or supporting appearances that established her as the mysterious blind date, or, the party girl everyone wanted to be around. (I\u2019m not 100% sure when the history of her family trauma came into the picture.)</p><p>Basically, it seems to me, however much you\u2019ve either read or watched of <i>Spider-Man</i>, no matter how much Mary Jane might\u2019ve evolved as a character across the decades the comic has been running, the only Mary Jane Watson people remember is 60s Mary Jane when a certain image or attitude about women was reinforced. (It\u2019s not dissimilar to people insisting that\u00a0\u201cPeter Parker must be a teenager\u201d or\u00a0\u201cPeter Parker must be unmarried\u201d whenever faced with the responsibility of writing adult-era Peter Parker.)</p><p>And if it\u2019s not 60s\u2019 Mary Jane, then its Sam Raimi\u2019s Mary Jane, who was accosted and abducted throughout the film series by Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom, because she was unfortunate enough to know Peter Parker.</p><p>It\u2019s an issue when the\nbiggest impression that your female character leaves is being thrown into a\nstate of \u201cconstant\u201d peril with her superhero boyfriend to rescue her (either as a\nromantic sentiment or just to demonstrate just how superhuman he is). You, as a fan, can pull out examples of the contrary all the\nlive-long-day, but if that is the prevailing impression within pop culture then that speaks to a\nlarger problem with the representation of women in general and how they\u2019re\nwritten by men.\u00a0</p><p>I\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stop any time soon, especially in\nsuch an insular good-ole-boys industry as the comic book business (where it\u2019s\nasking too much to draw anatomically correct women in costumes that don\u2019t look\npainted on), but this is not me saying \u201cstop refuting things with facts\u201d.</p><p>As a writer, it\u2019s your responsibility to collect\nevidence to the contrary, use those clarifications in your story \u2013 that while\nthey be an exception and not the rule \u2013 so you\u2019re not perpetuating what is\noften only a half-true statement. Research the thing you\u2019re talking about,\nbasically. I mean, yeah, Mary Jane\u2019s been put in the hot seat quite a few times \u2013 that\u2019s a fact. But\nshe\u2019s also been in situations \u2013 in any iteration of the character you can think\nof \u2013 where she either worked together with Spider-Man, or didn\u2019t even need\nSpider-Man at all to get out of a situation.\u00a0</p><p>(I\u2019m also inclined to believe that the number of times she\u2019s appeared and nothing happens to her far outweighs the number of times she been in trouble with the requirement that Spider-Man needed to save her. But, that\u2019s me.)</p><p>Like, for the longest time, <i>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</i> was (for me) the biggest example of\na damseled Mary Jane as much as it made her capable of getting away from\nobsessive stalker boyfriends like Hydro Man, and then there\u2019s <i>Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\u2019s tightrope walk of\nputting her danger and putting her in situations wherein she got out without\nPeter\u2019s help, or with his help, then addressing that.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/958d6c72ee5f65765919b712b80bcc5a/tumblr_inline_pf6peh5ZyD1s8x54y_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>I don\u2019t think the writing for Mary Jane in this video game\nis necessarily bad, I think they did an otherwise solid job of capturing her\ncharacter and her voice, but, there is a clear distinction between whom\nspeaking the further the game goes on. Sometimes it\u2019s Mary Jane, as evidence in\nthe earlier parts of the game and later when that whole argument subplot is done and over with.</p><p>But, most of the time it\u2019s Insomniac\u2019s writers soap-boxing\nabout an issue that\u2019s not much of an issue when you know how to handle it. In\nthis instance, I don\u2019t think they handled it because they didn\u2019t know to create\nlegitimate conflict between Peter and Mary Jane without going over old ground\nwith nothing particularly new or insightful to say.</p><p>There\u2019s showing how determined or dedicated a character is to their job, regardless of the danger, and then there\u2019s creating scenarios where your character ends up looking incredibly unseasonable, and irresponsible. This is the latter.</p><blockquote><p>(Also, if you\u2019re going to reblog this, for-the-love-of-mike,\ndon\u2019t put long ass comic book scans on this post. Thanks.

But, their opinion seems entirely based on an era comic books she initially appeared in that haven\u2019t been relevant beyond historical reference.\u00a0</p><p>And for the most part, Mary Jane\u2019s role in the 60s era <i>Spider-Man</i> comics were brief or supporting appearances that established her as the mysterious blind date, or, the party girl everyone wanted to be around. (I\u2019m not 100% sure when the history of her family trauma came into the picture.)</p><p>Basically, it seems to me, however much you\u2019ve either read or watched of <i>Spider-Man</i>, no matter how much Mary Jane might\u2019ve evolved as a character across the decades the comic has been running, the only Mary Jane Watson people remember is 60s Mary Jane when a certain image or attitude about women was reinforced. (It\u2019s not dissimilar to people insisting that\u00a0\u201cPeter Parker must be a teenager\u201d or\u00a0\u201cPeter Parker must be unmarried\u201d whenever faced with the responsibility of writing adult-era Peter Parker.)</p><p>And if it\u2019s not 60s\u2019 Mary Jane, then its Sam Raimi\u2019s Mary Jane, who was accosted and abducted throughout the film series by Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom, because she was unfortunate enough to know Peter Parker.</p><p>It\u2019s an issue when the\nbiggest impression that your female character leaves is being thrown into a\nstate of \u201cconstant\u201d peril with her superhero boyfriend to rescue her (either as a\nromantic sentiment or just to demonstrate just how superhuman he is). You, as a fan, can pull out examples of the contrary all the\nlive-long-day, but if that is the prevailing impression within pop culture then that speaks to a\nlarger problem with the representation of women in general and how they\u2019re\nwritten by men.\u00a0</p><p>I\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stop any time soon, especially in\nsuch an insular good-ole-boys industry as the comic book business (where it\u2019s\nasking too much to draw anatomically correct women in costumes that don\u2019t look\npainted on), but this is not me saying \u201cstop refuting things with facts\u201d.</p><p>As a writer, it\u2019s your responsibility to collect\nevidence to the contrary, use those clarifications in your story \u2013 that while\nthey be an exception and not the rule \u2013 so you\u2019re not perpetuating what is\noften only a half-true statement. Research the thing you\u2019re talking about,\nbasically. I mean, yeah, Mary Jane\u2019s been put in the hot seat quite a few times \u2013 that\u2019s a fact. But\nshe\u2019s also been in situations \u2013 in any iteration of the character you can think\nof \u2013 where she either worked together with Spider-Man, or didn\u2019t even need\nSpider-Man at all to get out of a situation.\u00a0</p><p>(I\u2019m also inclined to believe that the number of times she\u2019s appeared and nothing happens to her far outweighs the number of times she been in trouble with the requirement that Spider-Man needed to save her. But, that\u2019s me.)</p><p>Like, for the longest time, <i>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</i> was (for me) the biggest example of\na damseled Mary Jane as much as it made her capable of getting away from\nobsessive stalker boyfriends like Hydro Man, and then there\u2019s <i>Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\u2019s tightrope walk of\nputting her danger and putting her in situations wherein she got out without\nPeter\u2019s help, or with his help, then addressing that.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/958d6c72ee5f65765919b712b80bcc5a/tumblr_inline_pf6peh5ZyD1s8x54y_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>I don\u2019t think the writing for Mary Jane in this video game\nis necessarily bad, I think they did an otherwise solid job of capturing her\ncharacter and her voice, but, there is a clear distinction between whom\nspeaking the further the game goes on. Sometimes it\u2019s Mary Jane, as evidence in\nthe earlier parts of the game and later when that whole argument subplot is done and over with.</p><p>But, most of the time it\u2019s Insomniac\u2019s writers soap-boxing\nabout an issue that\u2019s not much of an issue when you know how to handle it. In\nthis instance, I don\u2019t think they handled it because they didn\u2019t know to create\nlegitimate conflict between Peter and Mary Jane without going over old ground\nwith nothing particularly new or insightful to say.</p><p>There\u2019s showing how determined or dedicated a character is to their job, regardless of the danger, and then there\u2019s creating scenarios where your character ends up looking incredibly unseasonable, and irresponsible. This is the latter.</p><blockquote><p>(Also, if you\u2019re going to reblog this, for-the-love-of-mike,\ndon\u2019t put long ass comic book scans on this post. Thanks.

(I don\u2019t think that was exclusive to the Disney cartoon.)</p><p>(If you can\ndeal with her being a mother and a superhero, sometimes both at the same time, you can deal with her not being a\nmodel/actress in every iteration there is for her). </p><p>It certainly is more <b>convenient</b> for the game\u2019s narrative. (it\u2019s akin to the 2016\u00a0<i>Frequency</i>\u00a0remake\nmaking Frank Sullivan a police officer versus a fireman who clumsily detective\u2019ed his way through a serial killer case). I\nlike the switch, especially since Peter (in this iteration of his story) is\nmore scientist than he is reporter. (But, I also like Peter telling Mary Jane\nthe truth in USM, so you know where I stand in general, I guess.)\u00a0</p><p>Insomniac\u2019s writing for Mary Jane for the most part, is fairly solid, but there are times where it\u2019s pretty\u2026 irresponsible (for lack of a better word). That, or just\nreally inconsistent for the sake of \u201ccharacter does things because plot\u201d.\u00a0 I like reporter Mary Jane, what I\u2019m not crazy about, I guess, is that making her a reporter for the Daily Bugle seems, not at all inspired by other canon material, but a tried and true argument that has become pretty disingenuous over the years.\n\n</p><hr><p>For the most part, a lot of the writing early on in the game\nnever presents Mary Jane or Peter Parker\u2019s relationship as one where Peter is\noverprotective or dismissive of her journalistic efforts. Hell, he doesn\u2019t even\ntalk down to her when she decides to jump into situation wherein she could be\nhurt. He just expresses his worry.</p><p>Her introduction, for instance, wherein she is trying to\nexpose Fisk for stealing (?) historical art pieces and selling them off as legit purchases,\ndemonstrates nothing but complete trust between the two characters, especially\nwith regard to what she can and cannot do. Mary Jane can sneak up on a guy and\nknock him out (when he\u2019s distracted), as long as there aren\u2019t other men\naround that can kill her the next second.</p><p>Mary Jane knows she can\u2019t fight or even handle the Martin\nLi\u2019s \u201cDemon gang\u201d, so she removes herself from the equation by hiding somewhere, and only ends up in\nthe middle of things when one of Li\u2019s henchmen is smart enough to do a thorough search\nof the exhibit she\u2019s in. Then Peter has to come and help her out.\u00a0</p><p>Afterward, a\nlot of Peter and Mary Jane\u2019s interaction highlights and centralizes her primary\nskill in this universe: investigation, digging things up, the thing that\u2019s kinda integral to her\njob at the Daily Bugle. It even demonstrates, for the most part, that her devil-may-care antics come with legal consequences (not that they appear lasting or impactful, but they\u2019re there). And, never once does she complain about having to look\nthings up, either for herself or for Peter \u2013 especially when they start working\non the same story (the \u201cDemon gang\u201d).</p><p>But, following Wilson Fisk\u2019s arrest and the introduction of\nMartin Li (Mr. Negative) as the antagonist, Mary Jane\u2019s attitude toward Peter\nbecomes questionably antagonistic.

(I don&rsquo;t think that was exclusive to the Disney cartoon.)</p><p>(If you can\ndeal with her being a mother and a superhero, sometimes both at the same time, you can deal with her not being a\nmodel/actress in every iteration there is for her). </p><p>It certainly is more <b>convenient</b> for the game&rsquo;s narrative. (it&rsquo;s akin to the 2016&nbsp;<i>Frequency</i>&nbsp;remake\nmaking Frank Sullivan a police officer versus a fireman who clumsily detective&rsquo;ed his way through a serial killer case). I\nlike the switch, especially since Peter (in this iteration of his story) is\nmore scientist than he is reporter. (But, I also like Peter telling Mary Jane\nthe truth in USM, so you know where I stand in general, I guess.)&nbsp;</p><p>Insomniac&rsquo;s writing for Mary Jane for the most part, is fairly solid, but there are times where it&rsquo;s pretty&hellip; irresponsible (for lack of a better word). That, or just\nreally inconsistent for the sake of &ldquo;character does things because plot&rdquo;.&nbsp; I like reporter Mary Jane, what I&rsquo;m not crazy about, I guess, is that making her a reporter for the Daily Bugle seems, not at all inspired by other canon material, but a tried and true argument that has become pretty disingenuous over the years.\n\n</p><hr /><p>For the most part, a lot of the writing early on in the game\nnever presents Mary Jane or Peter Parker&rsquo;s relationship as one where Peter is\noverprotective or dismissive of her journalistic efforts. Hell, he doesn&rsquo;t even\ntalk down to her when she decides to jump into situation wherein she could be\nhurt. He just expresses his worry.</p><p>Her introduction, for instance, wherein she is trying to\nexpose Fisk for stealing (?) historical art pieces and selling them off as legit purchases,\ndemonstrates nothing but complete trust between the two characters, especially\nwith regard to what she can and cannot do. Mary Jane can sneak up on a guy and\nknock him out (when he&rsquo;s distracted), as long as there aren&rsquo;t other men\naround that can kill her the next second.</p><p>Mary Jane knows she can&rsquo;t fight or even handle the Martin\nLi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Demon gang&rdquo;, so she removes herself from the equation by hiding somewhere, and only ends up in\nthe middle of things when one of Li&rsquo;s henchmen is smart enough to do a thorough search\nof the exhibit she&rsquo;s in. Then Peter has to come and help her out.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, a\nlot of Peter and Mary Jane&rsquo;s interaction highlights and centralizes her primary\nskill in this universe: investigation, digging things up, the thing that&rsquo;s kinda integral to her\njob at the Daily Bugle. It even demonstrates, for the most part, that her devil-may-care antics come with legal consequences (not that they appear lasting or impactful, but they&rsquo;re there). And, never once does she complain about having to look\nthings up, either for herself or for Peter &ndash; especially when they start working\non the same story (the &ldquo;Demon gang&rdquo;).</p><p>But, following Wilson Fisk&rsquo;s arrest and the introduction of\nMartin Li (Mr. Negative) as the antagonist, Mary Jane&rsquo;s attitude toward Peter\nbecomes questionably antagonistic. A lot of it is an artificial conflict so\nthat Peter and Mary Jane have something to fight about. (It&rsquo;s not enough that\ntheir not together because of issues with him being Spider-Man 80% of the time, as usual.)&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/797314468f9fcd1f9b1368317ac417a0/tumblr_inline_pf6om963dd1s8x54y_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Mary\nJane starts taking what are, really, some seriously unnecessary risks to get\nanswers for questions she might&rsquo;ve uncovered by just talking to the persons in\nquestion or nosing into people&rsquo;s paper trails. Like, instead of stealth\nsegments, maybe we could&rsquo;ve gotten <i>L.A. Noir</i> type levels with Mary Jane trying\nto investigate crimes for articles. Hell, that would&rsquo;ve been a perfect excuse to use Yuri\nWatanabe more in the narrative outside of phone calls and brief cinematics, but\nI digress.</p><p>Instead, she goes straight into armed gunman territory to\nspeak to one of Osborn&rsquo;s aide&rsquo;s (around the same time Peter is), without\ntelling Peter about it. She nearly causes a scene by surprising said aide, and then again when Peter\ndrops in when rescues her from what he assumed was a mercenary working for Silver\nSable. She then proceeds to get mad at Peter for admonishing her actions, showing the slightest concern\nabout her decisions, and behaves as though\nPeter told her to stay out of the situation (when that never occurred).</p><p>She even goes as far as to say that the reason they broke up\n(in this universe) is because he was somehow impeding her career as a\njournalist, when the reason, as usual, seems to be she just got frustrated with\nhow much time he dedicated to being Spider-Man versus his interpersonal\nrelationships (which is why the narrative has him repeatedly emphasize that his\nwork with Doctor Octopus is the better time sink. He has time for a personal life, at the very least).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/28d02b0a59b809eb9e3568ed2f8c0468/tumblr_inline_pf6opefUqf1s8x54y_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But, the narrative never treats her comments as though, out\nof frustration, she blindly assigned blame of their relationship problems on\nthe wrong issue (in this particular instance). It&rsquo;s a fact, despite Peter&rsquo;s protests to otherwise (which I\nguess are just wrong?).</p><p>The narrative paints this image that instead of doing what\nthey were doing in the introduction level, Peter has spent most of her career\nat the Bugle (and before that), telling her what she can and cannot investigate\nbased on the level of danger, when the most he&rsquo;s done is say, &ldquo;Mary Jane this\nis dangerous. Did you really think this all the way through? Why didn&rsquo;t tell me\nabout this so I could help you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s this insistence from Mary Jane that\nthe two of them are partners or could be partners, but that partnership is based only on when its\nuseful for her, and then when she gets into a situation that actually requires\nhis help, she bristles when he points out she was acting recklessly then\nproceeds to give him the silent treatment.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6453dd0e9cd524d07dda941cde5be5ef/tumblr_inline_pf6p154SPE1s8x54y_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And, obviously, the two finally sit down and talk. She\napologies for acting the way she does (after the Grand Central Station and F.E.A.S.T. shelter fire incident, anyway), and he apologizes for behaving in a way that gave her that impression, but the entire gist of the conversation\nis just set up so Mary Jane can say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always the one being saved, I just\nwanted to do the saving once&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>And it&rsquo;s here where you can hear the writer&rsquo;s\nvoice instead of hearing Mary Jane&rsquo;s voice.</p><hr /><p><i>Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i> (especially the first volume) did a fairly solid job setting up\nand illustrating Mary Jane&rsquo;s frustration with being &ldquo;damseled&rdquo;, primarily by\nhaving it connected to traumatizing events &ndash; like Ultimate Green Goblin tossing\nher off the Brooklyn Bridge, or being taken hostage by one of the Spider-Man\nclones, and dosed with experimental chemicals that turned her into a monster.</p><p>But, <i>Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i> also did a good job of either making Peter too caught up in his\nown dramas to notice her issues, or just being too late to help her and struggling\nfind a medium of empathetic and supportive, which could sometimes teeter into\noverprotective or insensitive. In both instances, Mary Jane&rsquo;s anger toward\nPeter and her circumstance can be justified by things within the narrative.<br /></p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing like that here in <i>Marvel&rsquo;s Spider-Man</i>.
