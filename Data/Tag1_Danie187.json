It was something they had spent a long time discussing and now finally there was a possibility of it becoming a reality. They&rsquo;d spent weeks upon weeks searching for an agency that fit all their needs and criteria. First off the agency had to be reputable and second, they had to be fine with them being gay. Finally, though they&rsquo;d found one they both really liked and hoped would be a good fit for them. The only thing left they had left to do was pass the home inspection and they would be well on their way to adding an addition to their family.</p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil are you sure you picked up the office?&ldquo;</i></b> Dan asked for the fifth time that night.</p><p>Phil gently grabbed Dan&rsquo;s shoulders and spun him around so he was now facing him.<b><i> \u201cDan the answer is the same as it was ten minutes ago yes I cleaned the office and I even triple checked it.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan sighed, <i><b>\u201cI know it&rsquo;s just everything has to be perfect you know? \u201c</b></i> He said softly.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s heart hurt for his partner. <b><i>&quot;Dan everything is going to be perfect. They&rsquo;re going to love us and they will approve us ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan looked uncertain.</p><p>Phil sighed and pulled Dan into his chest, <i><b>\u201cEverything is going to work out ok baby.&rdquo; </b></i>He said placing a kiss on his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Ok, Phil I trust you,&rdquo;</b></i> Dan said melting into Phil&rsquo;s touch.</p><p>Despite Dan&rsquo;s assurance that he trusted him Phil could still tell Dan was worried. When they finally went to bed that night the house looked practically spotless. They&rsquo;d spend the majority of the day cleaning every nook and cranny that they could find.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?&ldquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cMmm.&rdquo; </b></i>Phil hummed in response.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d tell us no because we&rsquo;re gay right?\u201d</i></b> Dan asked voice small.</p><p>There is was the real reason that Dan was so worried about tomorrow.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s heart broke a little. It was sad that they were still worried about that in this day and age.</p><p>Phil sighed lightly <i><b>\u201cIf I&rsquo;m being honest? &ldquo;</b></i></p><p>He looked to Dan who shook his head for him to go on.</p><p><b><i>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think they would deny us because we&rsquo;re gay. They seemed very accepting when we mentioned it during the vetting processes and remember that adoption website we looked at said they&rsquo;d helped gay couples adopt before.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yeah.\u201d </b></i>Dan breathed into Phil&rsquo;s chest.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo; Come on let&rsquo;s get some sleep we have a big day tomorrow,\u201d </b></i>Phil said reaching over and turned off the bedside table lamp.</p><p>Dan snuggled even closer to Phil laying his head on his chest. <i><b>\u201cI love you, Phil.&rdquo; </b></i>He mumbled half asleep.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo; I love you too sweetheart.\u201d</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>When Dan awoke the next morning he was in full blown little space. There wasn&rsquo;t a hint of an adult in him. Dan sat in bed for a few minutes but soon got bored. He&rsquo;d thought about waking his daddy up but he knew his daddy had been stressed lately and he wanted to let him sleep. That&rsquo;s when he got the brilliant idea he was going to make his daddy breakfast!</p><p>Dan quietly made his way to the kitchen as to not wake his daddy. What was he going to make? His daddy liked cereal and he certainly could make that.</p><p>He padded his way over to the cupboard to get a bowl. Once he got the bowl he set it on the counter and started pouring the cereal. Some of the cereal poured over the sides of the bowel and Dan bit his lip. He&rsquo;ll have to try and clean that up for his daddy later. He finished by pouring the milk and setting the bowl on the table.</p><p>Next, he figured he&rsquo;d go into the lounge to play. He pulled his box of toys from the bedroom into the lounge and started scattering the toys throughout the lounge.</p><p>He played for a while but soon got bored of playing by himself. He sighed he really wanted to play with his daddy. Figuring he let him sleep long enough Dan made his way to the bedroom to wake Phil.</p><p>Phil groaned as he felt wet kisses being planted all over his face.<b><i> \u201cMmm, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </i></b>He slurred.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWake up daddy!\u201d </b></i>Dan giggled.</p><p>Stating the obvious, &ldquo;<b><i>are you little today baby?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yes, daddy!\u201d </b></i>He giggled again placing a kiss on Phil&rsquo;s nose.</p><p>They laid and bed a snuggled for a few minutes before Dan was pulling Phil up. <i><b>\u201cDaddy daddy I have a surprise for you!&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>Dan said pulling Phil into the dining room.</p><p>The table was a complete mess of milk and cereal very little of it had actually made it and stayed in the bowl.</p><p>Phil tried not to show his annoyance Dan was little and didn&rsquo;t know any better.</p><p><b><i>\u201cThank you so much baby, but what had daddy told you about trying to make things by yourself while your little?\u201d</i></b> He asked.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s bottom lip began to quiver, <i><b>&quot;you say not to.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>&quot;That&rsquo;s right and why is that baby?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBecause I could hurt myself,\u201d </b></i>Dan said eyes downcast to the floor.</p><p><i><b>\u201cBut I wanted to be nice!</b></i>&ldquo; Dan argued.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIt is nice but you must listen to daddy from now on alright?\u201d</b></i> Phil said sternly.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yes, daddy.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil quickly ate his breakfast and cleaned up Dan&rsquo;s mess before he made his way into the lounge. The adoption agent would be here in less than an hour and he wanted to have some time to relax before they showed up. But his hopes of relaxation where quickly dashed the moment he entered the lounge. Dan had scattered every last one of his toys from one side of the live room to the other.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy look!&ldquo;</b></i> Dan squealed holding up one of his stuffed animals.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s blood was boiling they&rsquo;d spent hours yesterday cleaning the flat making sure it was tip-top shape for today.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaniel! What is this!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil all but shouted at the boy.</p><p>The moment he did though he instantly regretted it. Dan&rsquo;s face fell and tears started streaming from his face. <i><b>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry daddy!&ldquo;</b></i> Dan sobbed throwing his stuffed animal down on the floor and darting towards the bedroom.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan wait!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil yelled running after the sobbing boy.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan I&rsquo;m sorry!&ldquo;</b></i> Phil pounded on their bedroom door. He attempted to open it but was met with resistance so he assumed Dan must be sitting on the other side up against it.</p><p>He could still hear Dan sobbing from the other side of the door.</p><p><i><b>\u201cBaby I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; </b></i>Phil pleaded desperation seeping out of his voice.</p><p>He heard a muffle from inside the room but could make out what it was. Phil sank to the floor, <b><i>\u201cbaby can you please open the door for daddy?\u201d</i></b></p><p>The sobs continued for a while but eventually, they stopped. Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure how long it took but eventually, the door creaked open and Dan&rsquo;s head peeked around the corner.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey, baby.&ldquo; </b></i>Phil said softly.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Hi, Dawdy.\u201d</b></i> He mumbled.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo; Oh, baby I&rsquo;m so sorry for shouting at you.&rdquo;</i></b> Phil didn&rsquo;t realize he now had tears running down his face.</p><p>Dan threw his arms around him. <i><b>\u201cMe sorry to daddy.&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>The pair sobbed into each other. Eventually, though the crying came to an end.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDaddy&rsquo;s gotta go pick up the lounge do you think you can be a good boy while I do that?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan&rsquo;s face fell, <i><b>&quot;I want you Dawdy.</b></i>\u201d He said clinging harder to Phil.</p><p>Phil sighed he really didn&rsquo;t want to upset him again. So with difficulty, he carried Dan to the lounge and attempted to clean up the mess he had made while Dan clings to him.</p><p>Halfway through picking up the mess Dan slowly started coming out of little space which Phil would never admit out loud he was kind of grateful for. He loved his baby boy he really did but sometimes he needs his boyfriend and this was one of those times.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>I&rsquo;m sorry Phil.&rdquo;</i></b> He began but Phil cut him off,<b><i> \u201cthere&rsquo;s no need to be sorry love.\u201d</i></b></p><p>The pair smiled at each knowing that they still loved each other.</p><p>Dan was just getting ready to help Phil clean up when their doorbell went off.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShit!&ldquo;</b></i> Phil said looking at the clock on his phone. He hadn&rsquo;t realized how late it was.</p><p>The lounge was still partially a mess and the representative for the adoption agency was here.</p><p>The two looked at each other unsure as what to do.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWell, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it now,&rdquo; </b></i>Phil said stating the obvious.</p><p>The quickly made their way down and answered the door.</p><p>They were greeted with an older looking lady with graying hair and a very stern looking face. She introduced herself as Mary.</p><p>They started the \u201cinterview&quot; by giving Mary a tour of the flat.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;So here is the kitchen,&rdquo;</i></b> Phil said showing her their decent sized kitchen.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAnd what is it that you two do for work again?&ldquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&rdquo; Well, I work at the BBC as a radio DJ and Dan here writes a blog.\u201d </i></b>He didn&rsquo;t specify that the blog Dan had was an informative blog on littles and hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t ask.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI see.\u201d </b></i>She said making a few notes in her notebook.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;And how long have you two been together?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo; Ten years,\u201d</b></i> Phil stated proudly.</p><p>Phil hoped she didn&rsquo;t question why he was answering all the questions. He could tell Dan was teetering on the edge of little space again and he knew it was harder for him to slip if he didn&rsquo;t have to talk.</p><p>This was part of the tour Phil was dreading he knew the lounge was still a mess. They slowly made their way in and Mary stopped in her tracks and looked at the mess.</p><p><i><b>\u201cLooks like you guys already have a child. \u201c</b></i> She stated plainly.</p><p>Heat rose to both Phil&rsquo;s and Dan&rsquo;s cheeks. They made some excuse about their niece just being over and hope she would leave it.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Alright, I think that&rsquo;s it. You guys will know in a few days if your approved for the adoption process or not.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Thank you so much.\u201d </b></i>They both thanked her as they walked her to the door.</p><p><i><b>\u201cGood luck guys.</b></i>&ldquo; She said and turned around and left.</p><p>They both looked at each other and sighed they&rsquo;d just have to hope for the best.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The call came a few days later that they had been approved for the adoption process and it was noted in their file that they seemed like exceptionally good applicants because they clearly had experience taking care of children. Neither one of them felt it was particularly dishonest because when Dan was in little space he was a child and Phil did have years of experience taking care of him.</p><p>That night they laid in bed tangled together in the sheets talking about the future they were going to have.</p>",

It was something they had spent a long time discussing and now finally there was a possibility of it becoming a reality. They\u2019d spent weeks upon weeks searching for an agency that fit all their needs and criteria. First off the agency had to be reputable and second, they had to be fine with them being gay. Finally, though they\u2019d found one they both really liked and hoped would be a good fit for them. The only thing left they had left to do was pass the home inspection and they would be well on their way to adding an addition to their family.</p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil are you sure you picked up the office?\u201c</i></b> Dan asked for the fifth time that night.</p><p>Phil gently grabbed Dan\u2019s shoulders and spun him around so he was now facing him.<b><i> \u201cDan the answer is the same as it was ten minutes ago yes I cleaned the office and I even triple checked it.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan sighed, <i><b>\u201cI know it\u2019s just everything has to be perfect you know? \u201c</b></i> He said softly.</p><p>Phil\u2019s heart hurt for his partner. <b><i>\"Dan everything is going to be perfect.

When they finally went to bed that night the house looked practically spotless. They\u2019d spend the majority of the day cleaning every nook and cranny that they could find.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201c</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cMmm.\u201d </b></i>Phil hummed in response.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019d tell us no because we\u2019re gay right?\u201d</i></b> Dan asked voice small.</p><p>There is was the real reason that Dan was so worried about tomorrow.</p><p>Phil\u2019s heart broke a little. It was sad that they were still worried about that in this day and age.</p><p>Phil sighed lightly <i><b>\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest? \u201c</b></i></p><p>He looked to Dan who shook his head for him to go on.</p><p><b><i>\"I don\u2019t think they would deny us because we\u2019re gay. They seemed very accepting when we mentioned it during the vetting processes and remember that adoption website we looked at said they\u2019d helped gay couples adopt before.\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201d Yeah.\u201d </b></i>Dan breathed into Phil\u2019s chest.</p><p><i><b>\u201c Come on let\u2019s get some sleep we have a big day tomorrow,\u201d </b></i>Phil said reaching over and turned off the bedside table lamp.</p><p>Dan snuggled even closer to Phil laying his head on his chest. <i><b>\u201cI love you, Phil.\u201d </b></i>He mumbled half asleep.</p><p><i><b>\u201c I love you too sweetheart.\u201d</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>When Dan awoke the next morning he was in full blown little space. There wasn\u2019t a hint of an adult in him. Dan sat in bed for a few minutes but soon got bored. He\u2019d thought about waking his daddy up but he knew his daddy had been stressed lately and he wanted to let him sleep. That\u2019s when he got the brilliant idea he was going to make his daddy breakfast!</p><p>Dan quietly made his way to the kitchen as to not wake his daddy. What was he going to make? His daddy liked cereal and he certainly could make that.</p><p>He padded his way over to the cupboard to get a bowl. Once he got the bowl he set it on the counter and started pouring the cereal. Some of the cereal poured over the sides of the bowel and Dan bit his lip. He\u2019ll have to try and clean that up for his daddy later. He finished by pouring the milk and setting the bowl on the table.</p><p>Next, he figured he\u2019d go into the lounge to play. He pulled his box of toys from the bedroom into the lounge and started scattering the toys throughout the lounge.</p><p>He played for a while but soon got bored of playing by himself. He sighed he really wanted to play with his daddy. Figuring he let him sleep long enough Dan made his way to the bedroom to wake Phil.</p><p>Phil groaned as he felt wet kisses being planted all over his face.<b><i> \u201cMmm, what\u2019s going on?\u201d </i></b>He slurred.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWake up daddy!\u201d </b></i>Dan giggled.</p><p>Stating the obvious, \u201c<b><i>are you little today baby?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>\u201d Yes, daddy!\u201d </b></i>He giggled again placing a kiss on Phil\u2019s nose.</p><p>They laid and bed a snuggled for a few minutes before Dan was pulling Phil up. <i><b>\u201cDaddy daddy I have a surprise for you!\u201c</b></i></p><p>Dan said pulling Phil into the dining room.</p><p>The table was a complete mess of milk and cereal very little of it had actually made it and stayed in the bowl.</p><p>Phil tried not to show his annoyance Dan was little and didn\u2019t know any better.</p><p><b><i>\u201cThank you so much baby, but what had daddy told you about trying to make things by yourself while your little?\u201d</i></b> He asked.</p><p>Dan\u2019s bottom lip began to quiver, <i><b>\"you say not to.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\"That\u2019s right and why is that baby?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cBecause I could hurt myself,\u201d </b></i>Dan said eyes downcast to the floor.</p><p><i><b>\u201cBut I wanted to be nice!</b></i>\u201c Dan argued.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIt is nice but you must listen to daddy from now on alright?\u201d</b></i> Phil said sternly.</p><p><i><b>\u201d Yes, daddy.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil quickly ate his breakfast and cleaned up Dan\u2019s mess before he made his way into the lounge. The adoption agent would be here in less than an hour and he wanted to have some time to relax before they showed up. But his hopes of relaxation where quickly dashed the moment he entered the lounge. Dan had scattered every last one of his toys from one side of the live room to the other.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy look!\u201c</b></i> Dan squealed holding up one of his stuffed animals.</p><p>Phil\u2019s blood was boiling they\u2019d spent hours yesterday cleaning the flat making sure it was tip-top shape for today.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaniel! What is this!\u201d </b></i>Phil all but shouted at the boy.</p><p>The moment he did though he instantly regretted it. Dan\u2019s face fell and tears started streaming from his face. <i><b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry daddy!\u201c</b></i> Dan sobbed throwing his stuffed animal down on the floor and darting towards the bedroom.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan wait!\u201d </b></i>Phil yelled running after the sobbing boy.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan I\u2019m sorry!\u201c</b></i> Phil pounded on their bedroom door. He attempted to open it but was met with resistance so he assumed Dan must be sitting on the other side up against it.</p><p>He could still hear Dan sobbing from the other side of the door.</p><p><i><b>\u201cBaby I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </b></i>Phil pleaded desperation seeping out of his voice.</p><p>He heard a muffle from inside the room but could make out what it was. Phil sank to the floor, <b><i>\u201cbaby can you please open the door for daddy?\u201d</i></b></p><p>The sobs continued for a while but eventually, they stopped. Phil wasn\u2019t sure how long it took but eventually, the door creaked open and Dan\u2019s head peeked around the corner.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHey, baby.\u201c </b></i>Phil said softly.</p><p><i><b>\u201d Hi, Dawdy.\u201d</b></i> He mumbled.</p><p><b><i>\u201c Oh, baby I\u2019m so sorry for shouting at you.\u201d</i></b> Phil didn\u2019t realize he now had tears running down his face.</p><p>Dan threw his arms around him. <i><b>\u201cMe sorry to daddy.\u201c</b></i></p><p>The pair sobbed into each other.

They seemed very accepting when we mentioned it during the vetting processes and remember that adoption website we looked at said they&rsquo;d helped gay couples adopt before.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yeah.&rdquo; </b></i>Dan breathed into Phil&rsquo;s chest.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo; Come on let&rsquo;s get some sleep we have a big day tomorrow,&rdquo; </b></i>Phil said reaching over and turned off the bedside table lamp.</p><p>Dan snuggled even closer to Phil laying his head on his chest. <i><b>&ldquo;I love you, Phil.&rdquo; </b></i>He mumbled half asleep.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo; I love you too sweetheart.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>When Dan awoke the next morning he was in full blown little space. There wasn&rsquo;t a hint of an adult in him. Dan sat in bed for a few minutes but soon got bored. He&rsquo;d thought about waking his daddy up but he knew his daddy had been stressed lately and he wanted to let him sleep. That&rsquo;s when he got the brilliant idea he was going to make his daddy breakfast!</p><p>Dan quietly made his way to the kitchen as to not wake his daddy. What was he going to make? His daddy liked cereal and he certainly could make that.</p><p>He padded his way over to the cupboard to get a bowl. Once he got the bowl he set it on the counter and started pouring the cereal. Some of the cereal poured over the sides of the bowel and Dan bit his lip. He&rsquo;ll have to try and clean that up for his daddy later. He finished by pouring the milk and setting the bowl on the table.</p><p>Next, he figured he&rsquo;d go into the lounge to play. He pulled his box of toys from the bedroom into the lounge and started scattering the toys throughout the lounge.</p><p>He played for a while but soon got bored of playing by himself. He sighed he really wanted to play with his daddy. Figuring he let him sleep long enough Dan made his way to the bedroom to wake Phil.</p><p>Phil groaned as he felt wet kisses being planted all over his face.<b><i> &ldquo;Mmm, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </i></b>He slurred.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Wake up daddy!&rdquo; </b></i>Dan giggled.</p><p>Stating the obvious, &ldquo;<b><i>are you little today baby?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yes, daddy!&rdquo; </b></i>He giggled again placing a kiss on Phil&rsquo;s nose.</p><p>They laid and bed a snuggled for a few minutes before Dan was pulling Phil up. <i><b>&ldquo;Daddy daddy I have a surprise for you!&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>Dan said pulling Phil into the dining room.</p><p>The table was a complete mess of milk and cereal very little of it had actually made it and stayed in the bowl.</p><p>Phil tried not to show his annoyance Dan was little and didn&rsquo;t know any better.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Thank you so much baby, but what had daddy told you about trying to make things by yourself while your little?&rdquo;</i></b> He asked.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s bottom lip began to quiver, <i><b>\"you say not to.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>\"That&rsquo;s right and why is that baby?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Because I could hurt myself,&rdquo; </b></i>Dan said eyes downcast to the floor.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;But I wanted to be nice!</b></i>&ldquo; Dan argued.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;It is nice but you must listen to daddy from now on alright?&rdquo;</b></i> Phil said sternly.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yes, daddy.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil quickly ate his breakfast and cleaned up Dan&rsquo;s mess before he made his way into the lounge. The adoption agent would be here in less than an hour and he wanted to have some time to relax before they showed up. But his hopes of relaxation where quickly dashed the moment he entered the lounge. Dan had scattered every last one of his toys from one side of the live room to the other.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daddy look!&ldquo;</b></i> Dan squealed holding up one of his stuffed animals.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s blood was boiling they&rsquo;d spent hours yesterday cleaning the flat making sure it was tip-top shape for today.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daniel! What is this!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil all but shouted at the boy.</p><p>The moment he did though he instantly regretted it. Dan&rsquo;s face fell and tears started streaming from his face. <i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry daddy!&ldquo;</b></i> Dan sobbed throwing his stuffed animal down on the floor and darting towards the bedroom.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Dan wait!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil yelled running after the sobbing boy.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Dan I&rsquo;m sorry!&ldquo;</b></i> Phil pounded on their bedroom door. He attempted to open it but was met with resistance so he assumed Dan must be sitting on the other side up against it.</p><p>He could still hear Dan sobbing from the other side of the door.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Baby I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; </b></i>Phil pleaded desperation seeping out of his voice.</p><p>He heard a muffle from inside the room but could make out what it was. Phil sank to the floor, <b><i>&ldquo;baby can you please open the door for daddy?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>The sobs continued for a while but eventually, they stopped. Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure how long it took but eventually, the door creaked open and Dan&rsquo;s head peeked around the corner.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey, baby.&ldquo; </b></i>Phil said softly.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Hi, Dawdy.&rdquo;</b></i> He mumbled.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo; Oh, baby I&rsquo;m so sorry for shouting at you.&rdquo;</i></b> Phil didn&rsquo;t realize he now had tears running down his face.</p><p>Dan threw his arms around him. <i><b>&ldquo;Me sorry to daddy.&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>The pair sobbed into each other. Eventually, though the crying came to an end.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s gotta go pick up the lounge do you think you can be a good boy while I do that?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Dan&rsquo;s face fell, <i><b>\"I want you Dawdy.</b></i>&rdquo; He said clinging harder to Phil.</p><p>Phil sighed he really didn&rsquo;t want to upset him again. So with difficulty, he carried Dan to the lounge and attempted to clean up the mess he had made while Dan clings to him.</p><p>Halfway through picking up the mess Dan slowly started coming out of little space which Phil would never admit out loud he was kind of grateful for. He loved his baby boy he really did but sometimes he needs his boyfriend and this was one of those times.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>I&rsquo;m sorry Phil.&rdquo;</i></b> He began but Phil cut him off,<b><i> &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no need to be sorry love.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>The pair smiled at each knowing that they still loved each other.</p><p>Dan was just getting ready to help Phil clean up when their doorbell went off.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Shit!&ldquo;</b></i> Phil said looking at the clock on his phone. He hadn&rsquo;t realized how late it was.</p><p>The lounge was still partially a mess and the representative for the adoption agency was here.</p><p>The two looked at each other unsure as what to do.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it now,&rdquo; </b></i>Phil said stating the obvious.</p><p>The quickly made their way down and answered the door.</p><p>They were greeted with an older looking lady with graying hair and a very stern looking face. She introduced herself as Mary.</p><p>They started the &ldquo;interview\" by giving Mary a tour of the flat.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;So here is the kitchen,&rdquo;</i></b> Phil said showing her their decent sized kitchen.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;And what is it that you two do for work again?&ldquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&rdquo; Well, I work at the BBC as a radio DJ and Dan here writes a blog.&rdquo; </i></b>He didn&rsquo;t specify that the blog Dan had was an informative blog on littles and hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t ask.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; </b></i>She said making a few notes in her notebook.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;And how long have you two been together?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo; Ten years,&rdquo;</b></i> Phil stated proudly.</p><p>Phil hoped she didn&rsquo;t question why he was answering all the questions. He could tell Dan was teetering on the edge of little space again and he knew it was harder for him to slip if he didn&rsquo;t have to talk.</p><p>This was part of the tour Phil was dreading he knew the lounge was still a mess. They slowly made their way in and Mary stopped in her tracks and looked at the mess.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Looks like you guys already have a child. &ldquo;</b></i> She stated plainly.</p><p>Heat rose to both Phil&rsquo;s and Dan&rsquo;s cheeks. They made some excuse about their niece just being over and hope she would leave it.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Alright, I think that&rsquo;s it. You guys will know in a few days if your approved for the adoption process or not.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Thank you so much.&rdquo; </b></i>They both thanked her as they walked her to the door.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Good luck guys.</b></i>&ldquo; She said and turned around and left.</p><p>They both looked at each other and sighed they&rsquo;d just have to hope for the best.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>The call came a few days later that they had been approved for the adoption process and it was noted in their file that they seemed like exceptionally good applicants because they clearly had experience taking care of children. Neither one of them felt it was particularly dishonest because when Dan was in little space he was a child and Phil did have years of experience taking care of him.</p><p>That night they laid in bed tangled together in the sheets talking about the future they were going to have.</p>",
