They&rsquo;re evolving to be immune to a number of those popular alcohol-based hand sanitizers we all assumed would help to keep us from getting sick. Nature&rsquo;s amazing!</p><p>Seriously though, the planet is totally trying to kill us for all the shit we do to it.</p><p>From <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/08/hospital-superbugs-are-evolving-to-survive-hand-sanitizers/\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica</a>:</p><p>Bacteria gathered from two hospitals in Australia between 1997 and 2015 appeared to gradually get better at surviving the alcohol used in hand sanitizers, researchers found. The bacteria&rsquo;s boost in booze tolerance seemed in step with the hospitals&rsquo; gradually increasing use of alcohol-based sanitizers within that same time period&mdash;an increase aimed at improving sanitation and thwarting the spread of those very bacteria. Yet the germ surveillance data as well as a series of experiments the researchers conducted in mice suggest that the effort might be backfiring and that the hooch hygiene may actually be encouraging the spread of drug-resistant pathogens.</p><p>The more the bacteria drink, the higher their resistance to alcohol becomes. They&rsquo;re just like us!</p><p>The bacteria that researchers are most concerned about becoming tolerant to current booze-based sanitation products is called enterococcus faecium: it&rsquo;s responsible for the majority of infections that folks pick up in a hospital environment and has already proven to be resistant to a number of antibiotics. According to <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aar6115\" target=\"_blank\">this report</a>, bacterial tolerance to alcohol-based sanitizers could undermine the way that hospitals prevent the spread of bacteria and other ugly stuff, on a world-wide basis.</p></blockquote></p>",

        "body": "<p>Experts Call For Reducing The Amount Of Salt In The Diet Of Americans.\n<br/>\n The US Food and Drug Administration should operate steps to debase the entirety of salt in the American diet over the next decade, an expert panel advised Tuesday <a href=\"http://supermale.men/price/cheapest.html\" title=\"cheapest\">cheapest</a>. In a check in from the Institute of Medicine, an independent agency created by Congress to analysis and advise the federal government on public health issues, the panel recommended that the FDA slowly but to be sure cut back the levels of salt that manufacturers typically add to foods.\n<br/><br/>\nSo &ldquo;Reducing American&rsquo;s enormous sodium consumption requires establishing new federal standards for the amount of liveliness that food manufacturers, restaurants and food service companies can add to their products,&rdquo; a news unfetter from the National Academy of Sciences stated <a href=\"http://hghser.com/products/serostim-hgh-for-sale-uk.html\" title=\"serostim hgh for sale uk\">serostim hgh for sale uk</a>. The plan is for the FDA to &ldquo;gradually step down the supreme amount of salt that can be added to foods, beverages and meals through a series of incremental reductions,&rdquo; the disclosure said.\n<br/><br/>\nBut &ldquo;The goal is not to ban salt, but rather to bring the amount of sodium in the average American&rsquo;s fare below levels associated with the risk of hypertension high blood pressure, heart infirmity and stroke, and to do so in a gradual way that will assure that food remains flavorful to the consumer&rdquo; <a href=\"http://vitomol.top/natural/parfum.html\" title=\"parfum\">parfum</a>.\n<br/><br/>\nFDA insiders have said that the force will indeed heed the panel&rsquo;s recommendations, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Salt Institute, an work group, reacted to the news with shock. &ldquo;Public pressure and politics have trumped science,&rdquo; said Morton Satin, intricate director of the institute. &ldquo;There is evidence on both sides of the issue, as much against population-wide briny reduction as for it. People who are equally well-known in hypertension are arguing on both sides of the issue&rdquo;.\n<br/><br/>\nBut Dr Jane E Henney, chairwoman of the cabinet that wrote the turn up and a professor of medicine at the University of Cincinnati, said in a statement that &ldquo;for 40 years we have known about the relation between sodium and the development of hypertension and other life-threatening diseases, but we have had virtually no success in cutting back the sarcasm in our diets&rdquo;. According to the new report, 32 percent of American adults now have hypertension, which in 2009 charge over $73 billion to manage and treat.\n<br/><br/>\nAnd the American Medical Association asserts that halving the bulk of salt in foods could save 150,000 lives in the United States each year. &ldquo;There is incontestably a direct link between sodium intake and health outcome, said Mary K Muth, governor of food and agricultural research at RTI International, a no-for-profit research organization, and a colleague of the committee that wrote the report.\n<br/><br/>\nReducing salt in the American diet will take some time. It needs to be done in a stepwise and monitored process. &quot;Consumers will fit to lower levels of sodium that will be found to be just as ambrosial with gradual reductions over time.\n<br/><br/>\nThere was no debate about the health effects of excess sodium intake, added another body member, Dr Robert J Rubin, clinical professor of medicine at Georgetown University.
