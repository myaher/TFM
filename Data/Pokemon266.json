They may have a good share of fans these days but I remember at least a VERY vocal minority talking up how much they disliked the direction Pokemon was going design-wise. Common criticism being that the designs looked too artificial, Pokemon are often overdesigned, and the new art direction was a downturn for people. Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that of course, you do you and all that. The first two points I actually somewhat agree with though it&rsquo;s never been enough to ruin those gens for me.</p><p>Then Gen 5 happened when opinions on Pokemon were at what seemed like an all-time low post-Diamond and Pearl. Oof.</p><p>Sadly, when Gen 5 dropped, those feelings of resentment toward the Pokemon designs only sky-rocketed, as it released some of the Pokemon with the most ire drawn toward them out of all Pokemon in the entire franchise. Combined with that was the overall soft reboot approach Gen 5 had for designing Pokemon. Common criticism was that Pokemon like Woobat, Roggenrola, or Audino were inherently uncreative for being rehashes of already well-established Pokemon.</p><p>And I couldn&rsquo;t disagree more, of course. If anything I love how this generation ties so closely with Gen 1. It does so lovingly but not at all does it ever come off as pandering. It really shows how, as much as things stay the same, things have also changed in Pokemon. They bring some neat spins on familiar concepts, like Swoobat, Foongus, and Garbodor. But they also bring plenty of fresh taste to the table in Zoroark, Vanilluxe, and Escavalier and such.</p><p>A lot of the Gen 5 disdain seems to come from a handful of Pokemon, comparatively. Most common dislikes I see are Garbodor, Vanilluxe, and Stunfisk, toted as signs Gamefreak was \u201crunning out of ideas.\u201d Bah, I&rsquo;ve gone on this rant multiple times, on each of these families&rsquo; reviews, so I&rsquo;ll spare it this time. Tl;dr, I still fail to see how living garbage and ice cream and a flatfish whoopie-cushion-mine are bad bases for creatures. They&rsquo;re no less valid that living sludge and magnets! And again, I&rsquo;d have to see a generation of mostly dogs, cats, mice, and foxes imbued with different elemental powers before I&rsquo;d ever say Gamefreak was running out of ideas.</p><p>With keeping in mind how Gen 4 might&rsquo;ve been the end, if not for the series, then for that particular era of Pokemon, Gen 5 was an absolutely brilliant way to re-introduce everything. It really was a turning point, feeling like now that they&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of leftovers done and out of the way in Gen 4, they could start completely fresh in Gen 5 and make ideas that are entirely new for Pokemon. While Gen 4 may have suffered in the creativity department a little bit, the post-Gen 4 world of Pokemon is still moving strong to this day. There was definitely some internal re-thinking of the Pokemon design philosophy going on when they were making Gen 5 in one way or another. And whatever it is, it&rsquo;s clearly working, as each Gen from 5-onwards has been consistently strong in the Pokemon-design department.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1452\" data-orig-height=\"1016\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e584dd00261b7add0c941662a732bfc7/tumblr_inline_peie3llLnf1qd0gcp_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1452\" data-orig-height=\"1016\"/></figure><p>Even artistically, Gen 5 has a lot of polish and care behind it compared to maybe Gen 3 or 4, which had a tendency to put one detail too many into a design. That&rsquo;s not been so prevalent in Gen 5, barring perhaps Legendaries and maybe a tiny handful of others. Designs are even opting to be a lot more personality driven. Of course not meaning that to say Gens 1-4 don&rsquo;t have personality, but Gen 5 is a lot more expressive about it.</p><p>And if anything, Gen 5 is an ending just as much as it is a new beginning. This is the last we&rsquo;ll see of the 2D style of main series Pokemon game. It appropriately feels like a wrap-up to have one last revisit to older ideas. Gen 1, one more time before moving onto the 3DS. It also works for well expanding Pokemon&rsquo;s biodiversity in the game before Gen 6 and 7, where the creatures are considerably more wacky and out-there.</p><p>Either way, Gen 5 has a closeness to my heart in general. It introduced so many favorites, including TOP favorites, let alone my favorite Pokemon of all time at the forefront of the game&rsquo;s unveiling. This was also the first time I got to sit through the hype season of a Pokemon game. Anticipating the coro-coro leaks every months whilst waking up every morning refreshing Serebii like a maniac, just eagerly awaiting to see what the new Pokemon would look like. That was a fun time, indeed. The only thing that would&rsquo;ve made it better would be if I got to tackle the game blind other than what was officially revealed. But even then, this also marked the first time Pokemon had an engaging story and some actually really well developed characters. They were all ingredients for my favorite Generation to date, at least Pokemon-wise. The games and their story themselves are in tight competition with Sun and Moon, but that&rsquo;s for a later date.</p><hr><h2><b>Top 10 Favorites of Gen 5:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb393454f8d35dced961761c2db9bbbc/tumblr_inline_peie4nUNAl1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>Damn that&rsquo;s some stiff competition. And if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the first time we have a full house of 10 outta 10ers here. You SEE what Gen 5 has done to me?! Of course, there&rsquo;s Zorua. My favorite Pokemon of all time and everything, with Zoroark not far behind. Gen 5 managed to pick on some crazy niches of mine, even down to something as specific as a dessert monster! For real though, all of these Pokemon are lovely and near perfect.</p><hr><h2><b>The Top 10 Just Under the Top 10 of Gen 5:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa21f56ce45f69d4979b95eb4ff8dcaa/tumblr_inline_peie5dtZEl1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>Because DAMMIT there&rsquo;s so many good ones I can&rsquo;t pick <i>just</i> 10.</p><hr><h2><b>Top 10 Favorites Overall:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1201e4bb801873db24357c976ee94e5/tumblr_inline_peie73kIII1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>&hellip;Though I feel like the impact it&rsquo;s made on my top favorites may be a little deceptive, even if Zorua has finally toppled the champion four Generations in a row, Vulpix. If we were to look at more of a top 50 up to Gen 5, these newcomer faves would\u2019ve had an absolute takeover.</p><hr><h2><b>Bottom 10 Least Favorites:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85dc918bdd5ee93141898997c9a70378/tumblr_inline_peie8qYyyS1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>Gotta compress the monkeys and genies into one spot&hellip; cause they&rsquo;d pretty much take up the entire Bottom 10. And even then, I think it says something when only half of these I&rsquo;m not a very big fan of, and the other half are at least passable to <i>kinda</i> liking to me.</p><hr><h2><b>Bottom 10 Least Favorites Overall:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe79cf3c84e9d9a4da50786675c03933/tumblr_inline_peie9zHf8n1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>So they&rsquo;ll make the slightest of dents here instead.

Not that it was difficult in the Generation with no old ones in it, of course, but Black and White inspired that rule.) and I&rsquo;ll choose at least one Pokemon that&rsquo;s unassuming and I wouldn&rsquo;t be sure is good or not. It was Unfezant. Needless to say, bad stats and movepool matchup lead to it <i><b>swiftly</b></i> getting replaced by Zekrom as soon as the game asked me to. Heatmor\u2019s still low-tier enough to consider it the unassuming pick right&hellip;?</p><p>But for real, this right here is probably one of my most memorable teams through a game to date.

I feel like this batch of 6 (7) do it best, in that they are a clear reference to previous Pokemon, but have enough of their own merit to stand on their own as well. Swoobat is almost like an anti-Golbat, Genesect is a cool way to \u201cremake\u201d Mewtwo, Sawk and Throh are Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan but a little more visually tied together. Garbodor is more or less the Muk of the Generation, representing physical waste vs water pollution. And Musharna is just a good example of how you can take something as specific as a dream-eating tapir and put different spins on it. Fun!</p><p>&hellip;Okay I\u2019m bsing categories at this point just to make it last that <i>tiny bit longer</i>, sorry.</p><hr><p>And&hellip; it saddens me a little bit, but that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left to say about Gen 5. A fantastic Generation that&rsquo;s gonna be really hard for a future Gen to top for me. None so far has done it yet, and of course we\u2019ll have to wait and see if the rumblings of Gen 8 will triumph. But I digress, fret not! Not all is bad, because Gen 6 and 7 both give Gen 5 a fair amount of competition here. Next time, after the usual break, we&rsquo;re KINDA gonna move into Gen 6. But we&rsquo;ve got <i>something else</i> to cover briefly before we start Gen 6 for real.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"725\" data-orig-height=\"545\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f92f95832da917f2fe64cb40853fb2f/tumblr_inline_peift8OTJS1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"725\" data-orig-height=\"545\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"727\" data-orig-height=\"545\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e81326cfdd9459616dae35f2daa73473/tumblr_inline_peifttkNYn1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"727\" data-orig-height=\"545\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"459\" data-orig-height=\"344\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FX3yYGioc7cY\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"405\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3yYGioc7cY?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>[<a href=\"https://inikavulpixelreviews.tumblr.com/The%20Pokedex\">Archive</a>] <br/></p>",

They may have a good share of fans these days but I remember at least a VERY vocal minority talking up how much they disliked the direction Pokemon was going design-wise. Common criticism being that the designs looked too artificial, Pokemon are often overdesigned, and the new art direction was a downturn for people. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that of course, you do you and all that. The first two points I actually somewhat agree with though it\u2019s never been enough to ruin those gens for me.</p><p>Then Gen 5 happened when opinions on Pokemon were at what seemed like an all-time low post-Diamond and Pearl. Oof.</p><p>Sadly, when Gen 5 dropped, those feelings of resentment toward the Pokemon designs only sky-rocketed, as it released some of the Pokemon with the most ire drawn toward them out of all Pokemon in the entire franchise. Combined with that was the overall soft reboot approach Gen 5 had for designing Pokemon. Common criticism was that Pokemon like Woobat, Roggenrola, or Audino were inherently uncreative for being rehashes of already well-established Pokemon.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t disagree more, of course. If anything I love how this generation ties so closely with Gen 1. It does so lovingly but not at all does it ever come off as pandering. It really shows how, as much as things stay the same, things have also changed in Pokemon. They bring some neat spins on familiar concepts, like Swoobat, Foongus, and Garbodor. But they also bring plenty of fresh taste to the table in Zoroark, Vanilluxe, and Escavalier and such.</p><p>A lot of the Gen 5 disdain seems to come from a handful of Pokemon, comparatively. Most common dislikes I see are Garbodor, Vanilluxe, and Stunfisk, toted as signs Gamefreak was \u201crunning out of ideas.\u201d Bah, I\u2019ve gone on this rant multiple times, on each of these families\u2019 reviews, so I\u2019ll spare it this time. Tl;dr, I still fail to see how living garbage and ice cream and a flatfish whoopie-cushion-mine are bad bases for creatures. They\u2019re no less valid that living sludge and magnets! And again, I\u2019d have to see a generation of mostly dogs, cats, mice, and foxes imbued with different elemental powers before I\u2019d ever say Gamefreak was running out of ideas.</p><p>With keeping in mind how Gen 4 might\u2019ve been the end, if not for the series, then for that particular era of Pokemon, Gen 5 was an absolutely brilliant way to re-introduce everything. It really was a turning point, feeling like now that they\u2019ve gotten a lot of leftovers done and out of the way in Gen 4, they could start completely fresh in Gen 5 and make ideas that are entirely new for Pokemon. While Gen 4 may have suffered in the creativity department a little bit, the post-Gen 4 world of Pokemon is still moving strong to this day. There was definitely some internal re-thinking of the Pokemon design philosophy going on when they were making Gen 5 in one way or another. And whatever it is, it\u2019s clearly working, as each Gen from 5-onwards has been consistently strong in the Pokemon-design department.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1452\" data-orig-height=\"1016\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e584dd00261b7add0c941662a732bfc7/tumblr_inline_peie3llLnf1qd0gcp_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1452\" data-orig-height=\"1016\"></figure><p>Even artistically, Gen 5 has a lot of polish and care behind it compared to maybe Gen 3 or 4, which had a tendency to put one detail too many into a design. That\u2019s not been so prevalent in Gen 5, barring perhaps Legendaries and maybe a tiny handful of others. Designs are even opting to be a lot more personality driven. Of course not meaning that to say Gens 1-4 don\u2019t have personality, but Gen 5 is a lot more expressive about it.</p><p>And if anything, Gen 5 is an ending just as much as it is a new beginning. This is the last we\u2019ll see of the 2D style of main series Pokemon game. It appropriately feels like a wrap-up to have one last revisit to older ideas. Gen 1, one more time before moving onto the 3DS. It also works for well expanding Pokemon\u2019s biodiversity in the game before Gen 6 and 7, where the creatures are considerably more wacky and out-there.</p><p>Either way, Gen 5 has a closeness to my heart in general. It introduced so many favorites, including TOP favorites, let alone my favorite Pokemon of all time at the forefront of the game\u2019s unveiling. This was also the first time I got to sit through the hype season of a Pokemon game. Anticipating the coro-coro leaks every months whilst waking up every morning refreshing Serebii like a maniac, just eagerly awaiting to see what the new Pokemon would look like. That was a fun time, indeed. The only thing that would\u2019ve made it better would be if I got to tackle the game blind other than what was officially revealed. But even then, this also marked the first time Pokemon had an engaging story and some actually really well developed characters. They were all ingredients for my favorite Generation to date, at least Pokemon-wise. The games and their story themselves are in tight competition with Sun and Moon, but that\u2019s for a later date.</p><hr><h2><b>Top 10 Favorites of Gen 5:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb393454f8d35dced961761c2db9bbbc/tumblr_inline_peie4nUNAl1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"></figure><p>Damn that\u2019s some stiff competition.

Not that it was difficult in the Generation with no old ones in it, of course, but Black and White inspired that rule.) and I\u2019ll choose at least one Pokemon that\u2019s unassuming and I wouldn\u2019t be sure is good or not. It was Unfezant. Needless to say, bad stats and movepool matchup lead to it <i><b>swiftly</b></i> getting replaced by Zekrom as soon as the game asked me to. Heatmor\u2019s still low-tier enough to consider it the unassuming pick right\u2026?</p><p>But for real, this right here is probably one of my most memorable teams through a game to date. Unfezant aside, just about everyone kicked ass and took names. Gigalith especially. My Bertha wrecks house and I love her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78e7d08fdbffe8fe0c673fd9e00a100b/tumblr_inline_peif03bteJ1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\"></figure><p>And then there\u2019s my team for White 2. My unassuming Pokemon was Magnemite, but then it turned out Magnezone actually kicks a lot of ass. Probably partly what led to me falling in love with the thing.</p><hr><h2><b>Most Long Overdue Concepts and Creatures:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3949c4ecb6c3ee6061e3b9e8c63a33f/tumblr_inline_peif2lMRh31qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\"></figure><p>Galvantula\u2019s on here just because it\u2019s A.

I feel like this batch of 6 (7) do it best, in that they are a clear reference to previous Pokemon, but have enough of their own merit to stand on their own as well. Swoobat is almost like an anti-Golbat, Genesect is a cool way to \u201cremake\u201d Mewtwo, Sawk and Throh are Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan but a little more visually tied together. Garbodor is more or less the Muk of the Generation, representing physical waste vs water pollution. And Musharna is just a good example of how you can take something as specific as a dream-eating tapir and put different spins on it. Fun!</p><p>\u2026Okay I\u2019m bsing categories at this point just to make it last that <i>tiny bit longer</i>, sorry.</p><hr><p>And\u2026 it saddens me a little bit, but that\u2019s all that\u2019s left to say about Gen 5. A fantastic Generation that\u2019s gonna be really hard for a future Gen to top for me. None so far has done it yet, and of course we\u2019ll have to wait and see if the rumblings of Gen 8 will triumph. But I digress, fret not! Not all is bad, because Gen 6 and 7 both give Gen 5 a fair amount of competition here. Next time, after the usual break, we\u2019re KINDA gonna move into Gen 6. But we\u2019ve got <i>something else</i> to cover briefly before we start Gen 6 for real.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"725\" data-orig-height=\"545\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f92f95832da917f2fe64cb40853fb2f/tumblr_inline_peift8OTJS1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"725\" data-orig-height=\"545\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"727\" data-orig-height=\"545\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e81326cfdd9459616dae35f2daa73473/tumblr_inline_peifttkNYn1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"727\" data-orig-height=\"545\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"459\" data-orig-height=\"344\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FX3yYGioc7cY\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"405\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3yYGioc7cY?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>[<a href=\"https://inikavulpixelreviews.tumblr.com/The%20Pokedex\">Archive</a>] <br></p></p>",

They may have a good share of fans these days but I remember at least a VERY vocal minority talking up how much they disliked the direction Pokemon was going design-wise. Common criticism being that the designs looked too artificial, Pokemon are often overdesigned, and the new art direction was a downturn for people. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that of course, you do you and all that. The first two points I actually somewhat agree with though it\u2019s never been enough to ruin those gens for me.</p><p>Then Gen 5 happened when opinions on Pokemon were at what seemed like an all-time low post-Diamond and Pearl. Oof.</p><p>Sadly, when Gen 5 dropped, those feelings of resentment toward the Pokemon designs only sky-rocketed, as it released some of the Pokemon with the most ire drawn toward them out of all Pokemon in the entire franchise. Combined with that was the overall soft reboot approach Gen 5 had for designing Pokemon. Common criticism was that Pokemon like Woobat, Roggenrola, or Audino were inherently uncreative for being rehashes of already well-established Pokemon.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t disagree more, of course. If anything I love how this generation ties so closely with Gen 1. It does so lovingly but not at all does it ever come off as pandering. It really shows how, as much as things stay the same, things have also changed in Pokemon. They bring some neat spins on familiar concepts, like Swoobat, Foongus, and Garbodor. But they also bring plenty of fresh taste to the table in Zoroark, Vanilluxe, and Escavalier and such.</p><p>A lot of the Gen 5 disdain seems to come from a handful of Pokemon, comparatively. Most common dislikes I see are Garbodor, Vanilluxe, and Stunfisk, toted as signs Gamefreak was \u201crunning out of ideas.\u201d Bah, I\u2019ve gone on this rant multiple times, on each of these families\u2019 reviews, so I\u2019ll spare it this time. Tl;dr, I still fail to see how living garbage and ice cream and a flatfish whoopie-cushion-mine are bad bases for creatures. They\u2019re no less valid that living sludge and magnets! And again, I\u2019d have to see a generation of mostly dogs, cats, mice, and foxes imbued with different elemental powers before I\u2019d ever say Gamefreak was running out of ideas.</p><p>With keeping in mind how Gen 4 might\u2019ve been the end, if not for the series, then for that particular era of Pokemon, Gen 5 was an absolutely brilliant way to re-introduce everything. It really was a turning point, feeling like now that they\u2019ve gotten a lot of leftovers done and out of the way in Gen 4, they could start completely fresh in Gen 5 and make ideas that are entirely new for Pokemon. While Gen 4 may have suffered in the creativity department a little bit, the post-Gen 4 world of Pokemon is still moving strong to this day. There was definitely some internal re-thinking of the Pokemon design philosophy going on when they were making Gen 5 in one way or another. And whatever it is, it\u2019s clearly working, as each Gen from 5-onwards has been consistently strong in the Pokemon-design department.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1452\" data-orig-height=\"1016\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e584dd00261b7add0c941662a732bfc7/tumblr_inline_peie3llLnf1qd0gcp_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1452\" data-orig-height=\"1016\"></figure><p>Even artistically, Gen 5 has a lot of polish and care behind it compared to maybe Gen 3 or 4, which had a tendency to put one detail too many into a design. That\u2019s not been so prevalent in Gen 5, barring perhaps Legendaries and maybe a tiny handful of others. Designs are even opting to be a lot more personality driven. Of course not meaning that to say Gens 1-4 don\u2019t have personality, but Gen 5 is a lot more expressive about it.</p><p>And if anything, Gen 5 is an ending just as much as it is a new beginning. This is the last we\u2019ll see of the 2D style of main series Pokemon game. It appropriately feels like a wrap-up to have one last revisit to older ideas. Gen 1, one more time before moving onto the 3DS. It also works for well expanding Pokemon\u2019s biodiversity in the game before Gen 6 and 7, where the creatures are considerably more wacky and out-there.</p><p>Either way, Gen 5 has a closeness to my heart in general. It introduced so many favorites, including TOP favorites, let alone my favorite Pokemon of all time at the forefront of the game\u2019s unveiling. This was also the first time I got to sit through the hype season of a Pokemon game. Anticipating the coro-coro leaks every months whilst waking up every morning refreshing Serebii like a maniac, just eagerly awaiting to see what the new Pokemon would look like. That was a fun time, indeed. The only thing that would\u2019ve made it better would be if I got to tackle the game blind other than what was officially revealed. But even then, this also marked the first time Pokemon had an engaging story and some actually really well developed characters. They were all ingredients for my favorite Generation to date, at least Pokemon-wise. The games and their story themselves are in tight competition with Sun and Moon, but that\u2019s for a later date.</p><hr><h2><b>Top 10 Favorites of Gen 5:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb393454f8d35dced961761c2db9bbbc/tumblr_inline_peie4nUNAl1qd0gcp_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"></figure><p>Damn that\u2019s some stiff competition. And if I\u2019m not mistaken, the first time we have a full house of 10 outta 10ers here. You SEE what Gen 5 has done to me?! Of course, there\u2019s Zorua. My favorite Pokemon of all time and everything, with Zoroark not far behind. Gen 5 managed to pick on some crazy niches of mine, even down to something as specific as a dessert monster!

They may have a good share of fans these days but I remember at least a VERY vocal minority talking up how much they disliked the direction Pokemon was going design-wise. Common criticism being that the designs looked too artificial, Pokemon are often overdesigned, and the new art direction was a downturn for people. Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that of course, you do you and all that. The first two points I actually somewhat agree with though it&rsquo;s never been enough to ruin those gens for me.</p><p>Then Gen 5 happened when opinions on Pokemon were at what seemed like an all-time low post-Diamond and Pearl. Oof.</p><p>Sadly, when Gen 5 dropped, those feelings of resentment toward the Pokemon designs only sky-rocketed, as it released some of the Pokemon with the most ire drawn toward them out of all Pokemon in the entire franchise. Combined with that was the overall soft reboot approach Gen 5 had for designing Pokemon. Common criticism was that Pokemon like Woobat, Roggenrola, or Audino were inherently uncreative for being rehashes of already well-established Pokemon.</p><p>And I couldn&rsquo;t disagree more, of course. If anything I love how this generation ties so closely with Gen 1. It does so lovingly but not at all does it ever come off as pandering. It really shows how, as much as things stay the same, things have also changed in Pokemon. They bring some neat spins on familiar concepts, like Swoobat, Foongus, and Garbodor. But they also bring plenty of fresh taste to the table in Zoroark, Vanilluxe, and Escavalier and such.</p><p>A lot of the Gen 5 disdain seems to come from a handful of Pokemon, comparatively. Most common dislikes I see are Garbodor, Vanilluxe, and Stunfisk, toted as signs Gamefreak was &ldquo;running out of ideas.&rdquo; Bah, I&rsquo;ve gone on this rant multiple times, on each of these families&rsquo; reviews, so I&rsquo;ll spare it this time. Tl;dr, I still fail to see how living garbage and ice cream and a flatfish whoopie-cushion-mine are bad bases for creatures. They&rsquo;re no less valid that living sludge and magnets! And again, I&rsquo;d have to see a generation of mostly dogs, cats, mice, and foxes imbued with different elemental powers before I&rsquo;d ever say Gamefreak was running out of ideas.</p><p>With keeping in mind how Gen 4 might&rsquo;ve been the end, if not for the series, then for that particular era of Pokemon, Gen 5 was an absolutely brilliant way to re-introduce everything. It really was a turning point, feeling like now that they&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of leftovers done and out of the way in Gen 4, they could start completely fresh in Gen 5 and make ideas that are entirely new for Pokemon. While Gen 4 may have suffered in the creativity department a little bit, the post-Gen 4 world of Pokemon is still moving strong to this day. There was definitely some internal re-thinking of the Pokemon design philosophy going on when they were making Gen 5 in one way or another. And whatever it is, it&rsquo;s clearly working, as each Gen from 5-onwards has been consistently strong in the Pokemon-design department.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e584dd00261b7add0c941662a732bfc7/tumblr_inline_peie3llLnf1qd0gcp_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Even artistically, Gen 5 has a lot of polish and care behind it compared to maybe Gen 3 or 4, which had a tendency to put one detail too many into a design. That&rsquo;s not been so prevalent in Gen 5, barring perhaps Legendaries and maybe a tiny handful of others. Designs are even opting to be a lot more personality driven. Of course not meaning that to say Gens 1-4 don&rsquo;t have personality, but Gen 5 is a lot more expressive about it.</p><p>And if anything, Gen 5 is an ending just as much as it is a new beginning. This is the last we&rsquo;ll see of the 2D style of main series Pokemon game. It appropriately feels like a wrap-up to have one last revisit to older ideas. Gen 1, one more time before moving onto the 3DS. It also works for well expanding Pokemon&rsquo;s biodiversity in the game before Gen 6 and 7, where the creatures are considerably more wacky and out-there.</p><p>Either way, Gen 5 has a closeness to my heart in general. It introduced so many favorites, including TOP favorites, let alone my favorite Pokemon of all time at the forefront of the game&rsquo;s unveiling. This was also the first time I got to sit through the hype season of a Pokemon game. Anticipating the coro-coro leaks every months whilst waking up every morning refreshing Serebii like a maniac, just eagerly awaiting to see what the new Pokemon would look like. That was a fun time, indeed. The only thing that would&rsquo;ve made it better would be if I got to tackle the game blind other than what was officially revealed. But even then, this also marked the first time Pokemon had an engaging story and some actually really well developed characters. They were all ingredients for my favorite Generation to date, at least Pokemon-wise. The games and their story themselves are in tight competition with Sun and Moon, but that&rsquo;s for a later date.</p><hr /><h2><b>Top 10 Favorites of Gen 5:</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb393454f8d35dced961761c2db9bbbc/tumblr_inline_peie4nUNAl1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Damn that&rsquo;s some stiff competition. And if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the first time we have a full house of 10 outta 10ers here. You SEE what Gen 5 has done to me?! Of course, there&rsquo;s Zorua. My favorite Pokemon of all time and everything, with Zoroark not far behind. Gen 5 managed to pick on some crazy niches of mine, even down to something as specific as a dessert monster! For real though, all of these Pokemon are lovely and near perfect.</p><hr /><h2><b>The Top 10 Just Under the Top 10 of Gen 5:</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa21f56ce45f69d4979b95eb4ff8dcaa/tumblr_inline_peie5dtZEl1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Because DAMMIT there&rsquo;s so many good ones I can&rsquo;t pick <i>just</i> 10.</p><hr /><h2><b>Top 10 Favorites Overall:</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1201e4bb801873db24357c976ee94e5/tumblr_inline_peie73kIII1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&hellip;Though I feel like the impact it&rsquo;s made on my top favorites may be a little deceptive, even if Zorua has finally toppled the champion four Generations in a row, Vulpix.
