Well, what about your idea of living in a shack in South Downs?&rdquo;</p><p>The angel dropped the calm fa&ccedil;ade and faced his companion, &ldquo;It was a &lsquo;cottage&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not relevant. And I still don&rsquo;t get why you&rsquo;d want to be so far away from the city&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need much from it and we could always just drive to the nearest one when we needed something.
