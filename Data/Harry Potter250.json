As he\nreached the edge of the forest, he suddenly remembered. He had spied on Snape\non his broomstick in there once, a million years ago, when he had still thought\nSnape to be wrong, and when he used to hate him. He now realised how much Snape\nhad suffered, and why he himself had hated Harry so much. His, Harry\u2019s, eyes\nwere the last thing Snape had seen when he died. With the love of his life\ngone, he had worked all his life to protect her son. The image of tears leaking\ndown Snape\u2019s eyes, as he had read Lily\u2019s letter and torn away her love flashed\nin Harry\u2019s mind. He fumbled absentmindedly in the pouch hung around his neck\nfor his mother\u2019s letter and his hand brushed the golden snitch.<br/></p><p>He\ntook it out. Knowing fully well what it contained, he touched the snitch to his\nlips and said \u2013 I am about to die\u2026 and finally, with a flutter of its silver\nwings, the snitch opened. Inside it was the black stone that Marvolo had worn\non his finger \u2013 the resurrection stone. He closed his eyes, turned the stone\nthrice in his hands and waited.</p><p>He\nsensed rather than heard the movement around him. He opened his eyes. There\nthey were, Lupin, smiling, and looking far younger than Harry had ever seen\nhim. Sirius was there too, looking at Harry with distinct pride. His father\nstood next to his mother, with arms around her shoulder but Harry\u2019s eyes sought\nthe man who was standing a little apart, with his hooked nose and the curtain\nof greasy hair around his face. The man too was looking at Harry, and crying.\nTears started leaking down Harry\u2019s eyes too and he walked towards him, with his\nhand held out, as if to touch the man. But as he neared the man, Harry\nrealised, with a sense of bitterness, that he could not touch Snape, who had\nheld out his hands too. He addressed him in a voice heaving with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI am\nsorry&hellip; I am so sorry for everything\u2026.\u201d Harry said, and he fell forward on his\nknees and broke down completely. Lily walked towards Snape and hugged him,\n\u2018Thank you so much for looking after my son, you really were my best friend\u201d. James\nturned towards Snape and said, \u201cI am really, really sorry Severus for\neverything that I have done to you. You are the bravest man I have ever known.\u201d\nSirius and Lupin moved forward and shook Snape\u2019s hand. Snape looked at all of\nthem and smiled, \u201cI am sorry Harry I gave you such a hard time. It was only\nbecause I knew, one day,<i> he</i> would have come back and, as much as I could not be\nhard on Lily\u2019s son, I had to do what was needed of me.\u201d</p>",
