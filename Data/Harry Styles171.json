She had only sent you a message a few days ago asking\nif you would like to come and despite everything that had gone down between you\nand Harry in the last few months you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to say no to her. </p><p>Now you\nwere stuck in her house because of the massive snow fall, cold after the power\nwent out with your ex eyeing you from the opposite couch. Just great.</p><p>Anne,\nGemma, Michel, Louise and Chloe were all playing \u2018cards against humanity\u2019, you\nand Harry were supposed to be playing as well but you had lost the mood to\nplay. All you could feel was the burn of Harry\u2019s eyes on your side. Neither of\nyou had bothered to place any of your cards down since the first round and the\nothers hadn\u2019t bothered to get you to play.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cOkay,\nlast round. Think we all need to go to bed and warm up.\u201d Anne said through a\nlaugh at the last card combination.</p><p>The fire\nwas crackling quietly in the mostly dark room and when Anne turned to look at\nyou sat next to her, she frowned slightly. She didn\u2019t know the specifics of\nwhat happened between you and Harry but she didn\u2019t realise how bad it was until\nthe two of you were in a room together. The two of you were colder to each\nother than the snow outside. Despite you and Harry being broken up you still\ngot along with Anne and Gemma so she thought you would have fun if she invited\nyou but she was very wrong and she regretted it. </p><p>\u201cI think\nI\u2019m already pooped mum,\u201d Gemma yawned, looking up at Michel. \u201cWe\u2019ll go up to\nbed now, good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood\nnight sweetheart.\u201d Anne smiled at the two as they hurried up the stairs before\nturning and looking at the rest of us. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to figure out beds. Gem and\nMichel are going to be in her room. Harry\u2019s in his room, Louise and Chloe can\nshare my bed, YN you can have the spare room and I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\nno, this is your house. I\u2019m fine on the couch, you have the bed.\u201d You\ninterrupted her as she started to organise the pillows on the couch.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\nI feel bad, I invited you and this is what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously\nAnne, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Reaching out a hand you rested it over arm to stop her from\nfussing with the pillows and she smiled softly at you before leaning over and\ngiving you a hug. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get\nyou some blankets.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry about it mum, I can grab them.\u201d Harry said flatly and you finally moved\nyour eyes to meet his. </p><p>You\nstared at each other for a few minutes before Louise said something and you\nwere snapped away from the deep swirling green of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cChloe\ncan have the spare room. You and I can have a mini sleep over.\u201d You chuckled a\nlittle as the two of them laughed all the way up the stairs, Chloe following\nbehind them with a confused look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get\nyou some blankets,\u201d Harry said when it was just the two of you alone downstairs.\n</p><p>You\nnodded at him because you weren\u2019t sure what could come out of your mouth if you\nlooked at him. You wanted to cuss him out. An argument was the end point of your\nrelationship and you still felt as if you hadn\u2019t said everything that you\nwanted to.</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d he\nstopped right in front of you, looking down at you so softly you thought he\nmight crumble. \u201cThere is room in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Shaking\nyour head, you looked away from him because you didn\u2019t want him to see the\ntears that were beginning to stain your eyes. \u201cHarry,\u201d you started.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\nthere\u2019s a lot of windows and doors down here, the cold comes in. It will be so\nmuch warmer in my room.\u201d He sat down next to you on the couch and instinctively\nyou moved away from him.</p><p>He was\njust trying to be nice, he was Harry and was as polite as a saint but it felt\nlike he wanted to do a lot more than just make sure you were warm for the\nnight.</p><p>\u201cJust\nsleep.\u201d You whispered, not daring to make eye contact.</p><p>\u201cJust\nsleep.\u201d He repeated.</p><p>Sighing\nyou pushed up from the lounge and started towards the stairs but Harry grabbed\nyou around the wrist to stop you. \u201cJust sleep Harry,\u201d You said sternly and\ninstantly he dropped his hand from around yours. </p><p>Breathing\nin deeply you made your way to his bedroom, you had only been to his mum\u2019s\nhouse a few times but you knew your way to his old bedroom in the dark as\neasily if you were in your own house. You heard the quiet click of the door\nclose behind you but you didn\u2019t turn to look at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nlook,\u201d you said as you started to pull your shirt over your head.</p><p>Harry\nchuckled and you heard the rustle of clothes as he started to pull his own\nclothes off. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, YN.\u201d He said before quietly adding, \u201cSeen you naked\nbefore as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nit I\u2019m going back downstairs.\u201d Grabbing your shirt, you went towards the door\nbut he stepped in front of you, blocking you from leaving.</p><p>Your eyes\nlooked down his chest, skimming over the dark lines of his tattoos. Even in the\nsoft blue light of the moon coming in through the window they were still so\nprominent against the muscled skin of his chest. His eyes did the same,\nglancing down to look at your chest as well, the lacy material of your bra\ndoing little to cover you.</p><p>\u201cLook I\u2019m\nsorry. I\u2019m not used to this.\u201d His eyes bore down into yours and out of the\ncorner of your eye you watched his hand reach out to run over your hip but very\nquickly decided against it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink you understand how much I really don\u2019t want to be here right now.\u201d Your\nvoice cracked a little as you created a little distance between the two of you.\n</p><p>\u201cI fucked\nup,\u201d He started loudly but quietened down to a whisper yell upon realising\neveryone else was trying to sleep. \u201cI fucked up. I never thought it would hurt\nyou, I told you I wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\nfuck is wrong with you? You\u2019re going to blame me after all this shit. You told\nme you loved me, that you wanted to be with me. You were the one that got\nfreaked out and disappeared for a week telling me you didn\u2019t want a\nrelationship, then you came crawling back with no apology and repeated it all\nover again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d he said again, staring at his bare feet. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d\nYou whispered, a fat tear rolling down your cheek. \u201cI love you Harry, but that\nhurt and saying sorry isn\u2019t going to fix it. Do you even mean it? Because it\njust sounds like you keep saying it so I forgive you and we can cuddle tonight.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nnodded and took a step forward hands reaching up again but you hurriedly pushed\nhis hands away. Shaking his head, he started walking to the bed and you stepped\nback as well to avoid meeting him but then your knees hit the back of the bed and\nyou fell backwards onto it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nHarry,\u201d You pointed a finger at him as he started to climb on the bed.</p><p>Shaking\nhis head again, he moved up beside you before lying down, his body a good\ndistance away from yours as he rid himself of his pants climbing under the\nsheets. Standing up you looked down to see him staring up at the ceiling. He\nwas quiet and complacent, chest rising and falling steadily. It was the\nopposite of the Harry you saw only seconds ago. </p><p>Slowly\nyou tugged your jeans down, keeping an eye on him to check he wasn\u2019t going to\nlook over at you. But he kept still, eyes locked to the ceiling. \u201cYou can have\nmy shirt.\u201d He said, voice flat.</p><p>Turning\naway from him you pulled your bra off and put your own shirt back on. This was\none of the reasons you were so annoyed with him. One moment he\u2019s talking to you\nand telling you he fucked up then he\u2019s silent and brooding. It was like talking\nto a brick wall when he was like this. </p><p>It made\nit hard to love him when he shut himself off emotionally. When he was open with\nyou, you had never felt warmer or cosier inside, his hugs felt like a home away\nfrom home and when he kissed you, he kissed you like his life depended on it\nand if he only a had a few breathes left to spare he would use them kissing\nyou. \u00a0</p><p>But when\nhe was closed off it was horrible. You were alone, cold and left wondering if you\nhad done something wrong. He left and every time he did and it felt as if he\nhad taken a bit of your heart with him.</p><p>Climbing\ninto the bed you kept as close to the edge as possible, swaddling yourself up\ninto the thick blankets to warm yourself up. You had almost forgotten about the\nsnow until that moment, even threw the heavy blankets you could still feel the\ncold bite of it. </p><p>\u201cI really\nam sorry, not just because I want to cuddle you.\u201d He kept his eyes on the\nceiling even as you turned over to look at him. \n\u201cYou know the phrase, you never know how much you love something till\nyou lose it? Never felt so real until you walked out.\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t reply to him. This was something that could wait till morning. \u00a0 </p><p>The\nweight of the bed dipped down as Harry moved closer to you and because you were\nalready so close to the edge you couldn\u2019t get away from him. Tears stung your\neyes, the adrenaline that kept you strong before was gone and you felt\nvulnerable with him being so close. </p><p>\u201cI do\nlove you.\u201d He started, hand caressing over the small of your back. </p><p>\u201cJust\nsleep Harry,\u201d You whispered, fighting off tears.</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou so much YN and I\u2019m sorry for hurting you and I do want to be with you so\nbad but I can\u2019t be that serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is\nbeing your girlfriend that serious Harry?\u201d Turning over you pressed a hand to\nhis chest, stopping him from getting closer. \u201cWe were dating, your mum called\nme your girlfriend and you didn\u2019t flinch so why do you have a problem with\nsaying it? I just want you to say we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nexhaled heavily, a hand coming up to circle around your wrist. His touch was\nwarm, contrasting the chill of the room. \u201cI freaked out. Every other\nrelationship turned to shit when it became official and I didn\u2019t want to lose\nyou, so everyone time I felt I was in to deep I had to leave and you were\nalways there when I wanted to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\ndid you think that would make me feel Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t. I was thinking about myself. I can be with you, I want to be and we can\nbe official. I promise no matter what I will come back to you, even if I get\noverwhelmed with it, I will come back to you because I love you and I want to\nbe with you.\u201d His voice was rough, cracking even and you chocked on a breath as\nhe lifted your hand up and pressed a soft kiss to the inside of your wrist. </p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d\n</p><p>Raising\nyour pinkie finger, you kept it in front of his eyes. He didn\u2019t hesitate, as he\nreached out and locked his pinkie finger around yours.</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d\nHe smiled softly, squeezing your finger. \u201cCan we cuddle now.\u201d</p><p>Humming\nyou pulled your finger back from his, hand pressing to his chest to make him\ngive you more room on the mattress. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more making up to do\nbefore you get any cuddles.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nsmiled and moved back but still tugged you so you weren\u2019t one small roll from\nending up on the floor in the middle of the night. You weren\u2019t going to give\nhim cuddles, well not voluntarily, it was Harry and you knew he would find some\nway of getting you in his arms in the middle of the night, for now though you\nsettled for threading your fingers with his. A little love is better than none.</p>",

Shaking his head, he started walking to the bed and you stepped\nback as well to avoid meeting him but then your knees hit the back of the bed and\nyou fell backwards onto it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nHarry,\u201d You pointed a finger at him as he started to climb on the bed.</p><p>Shaking\nhis head again, he moved up beside you before lying down, his body a good\ndistance away from yours as he rid himself of his pants climbing under the\nsheets. Standing up you looked down to see him staring up at the ceiling. He\nwas quiet and complacent, chest rising and falling steadily. It was the\nopposite of the Harry you saw only seconds ago. </p><p>Slowly\nyou tugged your jeans down, keeping an eye on him to check he wasn\u2019t going to\nlook over at you. But he kept still, eyes locked to the ceiling. \u201cYou can have\nmy shirt.\u201d He said, voice flat.</p><p>Turning\naway from him you pulled your bra off and put your own shirt back on. This was\none of the reasons you were so annoyed with him. One moment he\u2019s talking to you\nand telling you he fucked up then he\u2019s silent and brooding. It was like talking\nto a brick wall when he was like this. </p><p>It made\nit hard to love him when he shut himself off emotionally. When he was open with\nyou, you had never felt warmer or cosier inside, his hugs felt like a home away\nfrom home and when he kissed you, he kissed you like his life depended on it\nand if he only a had a few breathes left to spare he would use them kissing\nyou. \u00a0</p><p>But when\nhe was closed off it was horrible. You were alone, cold and left wondering if you\nhad done something wrong. He left and every time he did and it felt as if he\nhad taken a bit of your heart with him.</p><p>Climbing\ninto the bed you kept as close to the edge as possible, swaddling yourself up\ninto the thick blankets to warm yourself up. You had almost forgotten about the\nsnow until that moment, even threw the heavy blankets you could still feel the\ncold bite of it. </p><p>\u201cI really\nam sorry, not just because I want to cuddle you.\u201d He kept his eyes on the\nceiling even as you turned over to look at him. \n\u201cYou know the phrase, you never know how much you love something till\nyou lose it? Never felt so real until you walked out.\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t reply to him. This was something that could wait till morning. \u00a0 </p><p>The\nweight of the bed dipped down as Harry moved closer to you and because you were\nalready so close to the edge you couldn\u2019t get away from him. Tears stung your\neyes, the adrenaline that kept you strong before was gone and you felt\nvulnerable with him being so close. </p><p>\u201cI do\nlove you.\u201d He started, hand caressing over the small of your back. </p><p>\u201cJust\nsleep Harry,\u201d You whispered, fighting off tears.</p><p>\u201cI love\nyou so much YN and I\u2019m sorry for hurting you and I do want to be with you so\nbad but I can\u2019t be that serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is\nbeing your girlfriend that serious Harry?\u201d Turning over you pressed a hand to\nhis chest, stopping him from getting closer. \u201cWe were dating, your mum called\nme your girlfriend and you didn\u2019t flinch so why do you have a problem with\nsaying it? I just want you to say we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nexhaled heavily, a hand coming up to circle around your wrist. His touch was\nwarm, contrasting the chill of the room. \u201cI freaked out. Every other\nrelationship turned to shit when it became official and I didn\u2019t want to lose\nyou, so everyone time I felt I was in to deep I had to leave and you were\nalways there when I wanted to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\ndid you think that would make me feel Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t. I was thinking about myself. I can be with you, I want to be and we can\nbe official. I promise no matter what I will come back to you, even if I get\noverwhelmed with it, I will come back to you because I love you and I want to\nbe with you.\u201d His voice was rough, cracking even and you chocked on a breath as\nhe lifted your hand up and pressed a soft kiss to the inside of your wrist. </p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d\n</p><p>Raising\nyour pinkie finger, you kept it in front of his eyes. He didn\u2019t hesitate, as he\nreached out and locked his pinkie finger around yours.</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d\nHe smiled softly, squeezing your finger. \u201cCan we cuddle now.\u201d</p><p>Humming\nyou pulled your finger back from his, hand pressing to his chest to make him\ngive you more room on the mattress. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more making up to do\nbefore you get any cuddles.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nsmiled and moved back but still tugged you so you weren\u2019t one small roll from\nending up on the floor in the middle of the night. You weren\u2019t going to give\nhim cuddles, well not voluntarily, it was Harry and you knew he would find some\nway of getting you in his arms in the middle of the night, for now though you\nsettled for threading your fingers with his. A little love is better than none.</p></p>",

Just great.</p><p>Anne,\nGemma, Michel, Louise and Chloe were all playing \u2018cards against humanity\u2019, you\nand Harry were supposed to be playing as well but you had lost the mood to\nplay. All you could feel was the burn of Harry\u2019s eyes on your side. Neither of\nyou had bothered to place any of your cards down since the first round and the\nothers hadn\u2019t bothered to get you to play.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOkay,\nlast round. Think we all need to go to bed and warm up.\u201d Anne said through a\nlaugh at the last card combination.</p><p>The fire\nwas crackling quietly in the mostly dark room and when Anne turned to look at\nyou sat next to her, she frowned slightly. She didn\u2019t know the specifics of\nwhat happened between you and Harry but she didn\u2019t realise how bad it was until\nthe two of you were in a room together. The two of you were colder to each\nother than the snow outside. Despite you and Harry being broken up you still\ngot along with Anne and Gemma so she thought you would have fun if she invited\nyou but she was very wrong and she regretted it. </p><p>\u201cI think\nI\u2019m already pooped mum,\u201d Gemma yawned, looking up at Michel. \u201cWe\u2019ll go up to\nbed now, good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood\nnight sweetheart.\u201d Anne smiled at the two as they hurried up the stairs before\nturning and looking at the rest of us. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to figure out beds. Gem and\nMichel are going to be in her room. Harry\u2019s in his room, Louise and Chloe can\nshare my bed, YN you can have the spare room and I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne,\nno, this is your house. I\u2019m fine on the couch, you have the bed.\u201d You\ninterrupted her as she started to organise the pillows on the couch.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\nI feel bad, I invited you and this is what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously\nAnne, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Reaching out a hand you rested it over arm to stop her from\nfussing with the pillows and she smiled softly at you before leaning over and\ngiving you a hug. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get\nyou some blankets.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry about it mum, I can grab them.\u201d Harry said flatly and you finally moved\nyour eyes to meet his. </p><p>You\nstared at each other for a few minutes before Louise said something and you\nwere snapped away from the deep swirling green of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cChloe\ncan have the spare room. You and I can have a mini sleep over.\u201d You chuckled a\nlittle as the two of them laughed all the way up the stairs, Chloe following\nbehind them with a confused look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get\nyou some blankets,\u201d Harry said when it was just the two of you alone downstairs.\n</p><p>You\nnodded at him because you weren\u2019t sure what could come out of your mouth if you\nlooked at him. You wanted to cuss him out. An argument was the end point of your\nrelationship and you still felt as if you hadn\u2019t said everything that you\nwanted to.</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d he\nstopped right in front of you, looking down at you so softly you thought he\nmight crumble. \u201cThere is room in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Shaking\nyour head, you looked away from him because you didn\u2019t want him to see the\ntears that were beginning to stain your eyes. \u201cHarry,\u201d you started.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\nthere\u2019s a lot of windows and doors down here, the cold comes in. It will be so\nmuch warmer in my room.\u201d He sat down next to you on the couch and instinctively\nyou moved away from him.</p><p>He was\njust trying to be nice, he was Harry and was as polite as a saint but it felt\nlike he wanted to do a lot more than just make sure you were warm for the\nnight.</p><p>\u201cJust\nsleep.\u201d You whispered, not daring to make eye contact.</p><p>\u201cJust\nsleep.\u201d He repeated.</p><p>Sighing\nyou pushed up from the lounge and started towards the stairs but Harry grabbed\nyou around the wrist to stop you. \u201cJust sleep Harry,\u201d You said sternly and\ninstantly he dropped his hand from around yours. </p><p>Breathing\nin deeply you made your way to his bedroom, you had only been to his mum\u2019s\nhouse a few times but you knew your way to his old bedroom in the dark as\neasily if you were in your own house. You heard the quiet click of the door\nclose behind you but you didn\u2019t turn to look at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nlook,\u201d you said as you started to pull your shirt over your head.</p><p>Harry\nchuckled and you heard the rustle of clothes as he started to pull his own\nclothes off. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, YN.\u201d He said before quietly adding, \u201cSeen you naked\nbefore as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nit I\u2019m going back downstairs.\u201d Grabbing your shirt, you went towards the door\nbut he stepped in front of you, blocking you from leaving.</p><p>Your eyes\nlooked down his chest, skimming over the dark lines of his tattoos. Even in the\nsoft blue light of the moon coming in through the window they were still so\nprominent against the muscled skin of his chest. His eyes did the same,\nglancing down to look at your chest as well, the lacy material of your bra\ndoing little to cover you.</p><p>\u201cLook I\u2019m\nsorry. I\u2019m not used to this.\u201d His eyes bore down into yours and out of the\ncorner of your eye you watched his hand reach out to run over your hip but very\nquickly decided against it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nthink you understand how much I really don\u2019t want to be here right now.\u201d Your\nvoice cracked a little as you created a little distance between the two of you.\n</p><p>\u201cI fucked\nup,\u201d He started loudly but quietened down to a whisper yell upon realising\neveryone else was trying to sleep. \u201cI fucked up. I never thought it would hurt\nyou, I told you I wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\nfuck is wrong with you? You\u2019re going to blame me after all this shit. You told\nme you loved me, that you wanted to be with me. You were the one that got\nfreaked out and disappeared for a week telling me you didn\u2019t want a\nrelationship, then you came crawling back with no apology and repeated it all\nover again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d he said again, staring at his bare feet. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d\nYou whispered, a fat tear rolling down your cheek. \u201cI love you Harry, but that\nhurt and saying sorry isn\u2019t going to fix it. Do you even mean it? Because it\njust sounds like you keep saying it so I forgive you and we can cuddle tonight.\u201d</p><p>Harry\nnodded and took a step forward hands reaching up again but you hurriedly pushed\nhis hands away. Shaking his head, he started walking to the bed and you stepped\nback as well to avoid meeting him but then your knees hit the back of the bed and\nyou fell backwards onto it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nHarry,\u201d You pointed a finger at him as he started to climb on the bed.</p><p>Shaking\nhis head again, he moved up beside you before lying down, his body a good\ndistance away from yours as he rid himself of his pants climbing under the\nsheets.

It will be so\nmuch warmer in my room.&rdquo; He sat down next to you on the couch and instinctively\nyou moved away from him.</p><p>He was\njust trying to be nice, he was Harry and was as polite as a saint but it felt\nlike he wanted to do a lot more than just make sure you were warm for the\nnight.</p><p>&ldquo;Just\nsleep.&rdquo; You whispered, not daring to make eye contact.</p><p>&ldquo;Just\nsleep.&rdquo; He repeated.</p><p>Sighing\nyou pushed up from the lounge and started towards the stairs but Harry grabbed\nyou around the wrist to stop you. &ldquo;Just sleep Harry,&rdquo; You said sternly and\ninstantly he dropped his hand from around yours. </p><p>Breathing\nin deeply you made your way to his bedroom, you had only been to his mum&rsquo;s\nhouse a few times but you knew your way to his old bedroom in the dark as\neasily if you were in your own house. You heard the quiet click of the door\nclose behind you but you didn&rsquo;t turn to look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nlook,&rdquo; you said as you started to pull your shirt over your head.</p><p>Harry\nchuckled and you heard the rustle of clothes as he started to pull his own\nclothes off. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark, YN.&rdquo; He said before quietly adding, &ldquo;Seen you naked\nbefore as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nit I&rsquo;m going back downstairs.&rdquo; Grabbing your shirt, you went towards the door\nbut he stepped in front of you, blocking you from leaving.</p><p>Your eyes\nlooked down his chest, skimming over the dark lines of his tattoos. Even in the\nsoft blue light of the moon coming in through the window they were still so\nprominent against the muscled skin of his chest. His eyes did the same,\nglancing down to look at your chest as well, the lacy material of your bra\ndoing little to cover you.</p><p>&ldquo;Look I&rsquo;m\nsorry. I&rsquo;m not used to this.&rdquo; His eyes bore down into yours and out of the\ncorner of your eye you watched his hand reach out to run over your hip but very\nquickly decided against it.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nthink you understand how much I really don&rsquo;t want to be here right now.&rdquo; Your\nvoice cracked a little as you created a little distance between the two of you.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I fucked\nup,&rdquo; He started loudly but quietened down to a whisper yell upon realising\neveryone else was trying to sleep. &ldquo;I fucked up. I never thought it would hurt\nyou, I told you I wasn&rsquo;t ready for a relationship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the\nfuck is wrong with you? You&rsquo;re going to blame me after all this shit. You told\nme you loved me, that you wanted to be with me. You were the one that got\nfreaked out and disappeared for a week telling me you didn&rsquo;t want a\nrelationship, then you came crawling back with no apology and repeated it all\nover again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry,&rdquo; he said again, staring at his bare feet. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;\nYou whispered, a fat tear rolling down your cheek. &ldquo;I love you Harry, but that\nhurt and saying sorry isn&rsquo;t going to fix it. Do you even mean it? Because it\njust sounds like you keep saying it so I forgive you and we can cuddle tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry\nnodded and took a step forward hands reaching up again but you hurriedly pushed\nhis hands away. Shaking his head, he started walking to the bed and you stepped\nback as well to avoid meeting him but then your knees hit the back of the bed and\nyou fell backwards onto it.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nHarry,&rdquo; You pointed a finger at him as he started to climb on the bed.</p><p>Shaking\nhis head again, he moved up beside you before lying down, his body a good\ndistance away from yours as he rid himself of his pants climbing under the\nsheets. Standing up you looked down to see him staring up at the ceiling. He\nwas quiet and complacent, chest rising and falling steadily. It was the\nopposite of the Harry you saw only seconds ago. </p><p>Slowly\nyou tugged your jeans down, keeping an eye on him to check he wasn&rsquo;t going to\nlook over at you. But he kept still, eyes locked to the ceiling. &ldquo;You can have\nmy shirt.&rdquo; He said, voice flat.</p><p>Turning\naway from him you pulled your bra off and put your own shirt back on. This was\none of the reasons you were so annoyed with him. One moment he&rsquo;s talking to you\nand telling you he fucked up then he&rsquo;s silent and brooding. It was like talking\nto a brick wall when he was like this. </p><p>It made\nit hard to love him when he shut himself off emotionally. When he was open with\nyou, you had never felt warmer or cosier inside, his hugs felt like a home away\nfrom home and when he kissed you, he kissed you like his life depended on it\nand if he only a had a few breathes left to spare he would use them kissing\nyou. &nbsp;</p><p>But when\nhe was closed off it was horrible. You were alone, cold and left wondering if you\nhad done something wrong. He left and every time he did and it felt as if he\nhad taken a bit of your heart with him.</p><p>Climbing\ninto the bed you kept as close to the edge as possible, swaddling yourself up\ninto the thick blankets to warm yourself up. You had almost forgotten about the\nsnow until that moment, even threw the heavy blankets you could still feel the\ncold bite of it. </p><p>&ldquo;I really\nam sorry, not just because I want to cuddle you.&rdquo; He kept his eyes on the\nceiling even as you turned over to look at him. \n&ldquo;You know the phrase, you never know how much you love something till\nyou lose it? Never felt so real until you walked out.&rdquo;</p><p>You\ndidn&rsquo;t reply to him. This was something that could wait till morning. &nbsp; </p><p>The\nweight of the bed dipped down as Harry moved closer to you and because you were\nalready so close to the edge you couldn&rsquo;t get away from him. Tears stung your\neyes, the adrenaline that kept you strong before was gone and you felt\nvulnerable with him being so close. </p><p>&ldquo;I do\nlove you.&rdquo; He started, hand caressing over the small of your back. </p><p>&ldquo;Just\nsleep Harry,&rdquo; You whispered, fighting off tears.</p><p>&ldquo;I love\nyou so much YN and I&rsquo;m sorry for hurting you and I do want to be with you so\nbad but I can&rsquo;t be that serious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is\nbeing your girlfriend that serious Harry?&rdquo; Turning over you pressed a hand to\nhis chest, stopping him from getting closer. &ldquo;We were dating, your mum called\nme your girlfriend and you didn&rsquo;t flinch so why do you have a problem with\nsaying it? I just want you to say we&rsquo;re together.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry\nexhaled heavily, a hand coming up to circle around your wrist. His touch was\nwarm, contrasting the chill of the room. &ldquo;I freaked out. Every other\nrelationship turned to shit when it became official and I didn&rsquo;t want to lose\nyou, so everyone time I felt I was in to deep I had to leave and you were\nalways there when I wanted to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how\ndid you think that would make me feel Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndidn&rsquo;t. I was thinking about myself. I can be with you, I want to be and we can\nbe official. I promise no matter what I will come back to you, even if I get\noverwhelmed with it, I will come back to you because I love you and I want to\nbe with you.&rdquo; His voice was rough, cracking even and you chocked on a breath as\nhe lifted your hand up and pressed a soft kiss to the inside of your wrist. </p><p>&ldquo;Promise.&rdquo;\n</p><p>Raising\nyour pinkie finger, you kept it in front of his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate, as he\nreached out and locked his pinkie finger around yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Promise.&rdquo;\nHe smiled softly, squeezing your finger. &ldquo;Can we cuddle now.&rdquo;</p><p>Humming\nyou pulled your finger back from his, hand pressing to his chest to make him\ngive you more room on the mattress. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a lot more making up to do\nbefore you get any cuddles.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry\nsmiled and moved back but still tugged you so you weren&rsquo;t one small roll from\nending up on the floor in the middle of the night. You weren&rsquo;t going to give\nhim cuddles, well not voluntarily, it was Harry and you knew he would find some\nway of getting you in his arms in the middle of the night, for now though you\nsettled for threading your fingers with his. A little love is better than none.</p></p>",

How they practically shaped your personality, humour, and coping mechanisms? How seeing them passionate about what they\u2019re doing and seeing them come out with new things (whether it be music, movies, merch, videos, posts, etc.) you can\u2019t help but feel an overwhelming sense of pride because you know this person who means so much to you is actually doing what makes them happiest??? How on their bad days you understand them on a personal level and when they convey real emotions you feel like they\u2019re directing them to you like they\u2019re your friend and they chose you to confide in???? Anyways, I\u2019m just so lucky to have had the opportunity to look up to the wonderful people I do, famous or not. What a time to be alive. </p>",
