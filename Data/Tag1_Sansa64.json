        "body": "<h1>Arya and gendry </h1><p>Covered in dirt, mud and blood Gendry was surrounded by the once again dead bodies of the undead wights and their surge seemed never ending. He swung his hammer into the face of another wight slamming it to the ground as he pounded its face in. Spinning around he swung his new axe taking off the head of another wight as he fell to his knees. Trying to catch his breathe he willed himself back to his feet as another walker come toward him swinging and he stumbled backwards to avoid getting his bloody head chopped off and as he was falling down another axe appeared out of nowhere catching the walker in the chest as it was thrown back. The hound appeared from behind him walking toward his victim retrieving his axe and turned back toward Gendry. The hound held out his hand as Gendry gripped it and was hauled up back to his feet. The hound looked at his axe glanced back at Gendry and growled &ldquo;Guess you do know what you&rsquo;re doing. Axe hasn&rsquo;t broken yet.&rdquo; Turned and continued to chop wights in half. Gendry stunned shook his head and ran off toward the crypts since they were no longer safe for the women and children they needed to get them to the boats!</p><p>Running full speed into the crypts Gendry ran/tackled a wight in front of him as he slammed his hammer into it killing it once again and continued on his way. He skidded to a stop as he heard screams and whipped around heading the direction swinging his axe. The women and children were cornered by several wights as Gendry emerged into the room and threw his axe at one and clobbered another as he rushed to protect them. One got the timing and he was thrown into the chambers wall and he slide to the ground in a heap. Swearing to himself he jumped right back up and could feel blood running down his face as he positioned himself between the wights and the women and children. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Arya&rsquo;s sister lady Sansa as she braced herself against the wall attempting to protect others and gendry moved over to place himself closer to her cause if Arya&rsquo;s sister died she would probably break completely and he would do anything to prevent that from happening. Yes did she tell him in no small words not to die?! Yes she did and he was absolutely going to try to keep his promise but damn him if he let lady Sansa die down here! </p><p>Swinging his axe and hammer he took out most of them till one got a hit in and stabbed him in the leg and sliced him down his chest! He screamed in pain as he went down dropping his hammer. He looked up as the wight was ready to do the deathblow and stab him when all of a sudden the wights head was chopped off and the body fell to the ground. Gripping his side he looked up to see who finished it off and was looking at Lady Sansa gripping his axe with determination, fear, anger and other emotions in her eyes. She dropped the axe as she rushed over to him and helped him up but he didn&rsquo;t wait &ldquo;we have to leave now! This place is no longer safe for all of you we got to get to the boats now!&rdquo; Hauling himself up the rest of the way he retrieved his axe from the ground and ushered everyone out of the crypts as fast as he could willing them to move faster! Sansa gripped his hand as she moved in front of him as they ran out of the crypts together. She stopped as he nearly ran into her and she looked back at her home of winterfell as it burned. &ldquo;My family is buried here my whole family and now it&rsquo;s burning to the ground. A stark should always be at winterfell and now there never will be again.&rdquo; Sansa with tears in her eyes and emotion in her voice. Gendry wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say and not sound like a total bastard to hurry her out of here so all he could do was tighten his grip on her hand to get her attention back. &ldquo;Not to sound like an uncaring insensitive bastard but lady Sansa we have to go now. I&rsquo;m sorry for all of this but we gotta go.&rdquo; Sansa turned to him and with one final look back she nodded to him as she got a look at all the dead bodies littering the ground around them! It shocked her to her core to see so much death and gendry feared he would have to drag her away and his leg and chest wound were not going to let that happen easily but too bad pain and suffering was something he knew. Out of nowhere theon appeared and Sansa let go of gendrys hand and ran to theon as he grab her hand nodded to him as he pointed behind Gendry at the wights coming up behind him. &ldquo;Go I will hold them off get her to the ships!&rdquo; Gendry screamed as he turned to give them time to get away.</p><p>Arya saw Sansa and theon running through the courtyard toward the ships and was relieved to see her sister had survived the wights in the crypts the one area she was running to in order to help get them out. Theon had already done that or so she thought. Looking behind them she saw soldiers fighting off more wights that had broken through and were rushing toward them and amongst those soldiers was a figure she knew very well! Gendry! He was holding off the wights as Sansa and theon ran and Arya without a second thought jumped down into th courtyard and raced toward him. Behind her she heard Sansa yelling at her &ldquo;Arya! No we need to get to the boats now what are you doing?!&rdquo; Arya ignored her as she raced to gendrys side taking out a walker he didn&rsquo;t see behind him. Gendry whipped around to see Arya standing beside him her weapon he had made her in her hands as she skillfully took out a walker behind him. He couldn&rsquo;t help but smile as he saw her beside him but fear spiked his blood as a wight come up behind her and she must of seen the look in his as since she ducked as he swung his axe taking off its head. Spinning around she stood up smiled at him and was ready to battle beside him. Jon was racing down the walls toward the courtyard sounding the retreat to every man he passed the battle was lost it was time to run! He ran toward the courtyard and witnessed Arya, Gendry, the hound, jamie and brienne fighting off the hordes of wights that were never ending. It was the first time he had seen Arya fight and it was damn amazing to watch as she cut down walker and walker as Gendry seemed to read her every move and cut down wights she missed or couldn&rsquo;t get to in time. They were in sync and their fighting seemed like a dance. &ldquo;RETREAT! EVERYONE TO THE SHIPS NOW!&rdquo; Jon screamed at them as he took out his own wight by cutting it in half. He looked toward the crypts and started that way before Gendry and Arya got to him &ldquo;the women and children are out! The crypt is empty except for the dead that now have made it their own!&rdquo; Gendry screamed at him as he and Arya raced by him and he noticed Arya was gripping the blacksmiths hand. Jon joined them as they raced toward the boats as the dragons burned winterfell and the wights to the ground. </p><p>Ships were quickly departing as everyone attempted to get on one in order to leave winterfell as it burned. The battle was lost and no matter what it was a devastating blow to their fight against the night king. Arya, Jon, Sansa, Gendry, bran and theon and dany were on one ship as where jamie, brienne, jorah and the hound were on another one. Arya knew many were dead by at the moment the most important people were alive on the ships. Arya had her arm around Gendry and he had an arm wrapped around her shoulders as they watched her home burn. She didn&rsquo;t know if it was blood or tears running down her face but it was probably both. She was able to take a closer look at Gendry and was just noticing his wounds and how badly they were bleeding. &ldquo;We need to fix your injuries. They are bleeding badly.&rdquo; Arya told Gendry with concern lacing her words. He tilted her head up he examined the cut on her forehead &ldquo;you have an wound that needs tending to as well Arya. Yours first I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; He softy spoke as he gazed at her with a concerned look and love. Just as they were about limp over to get tended to Sansa stopped them as she looked at Gendry. &ldquo;Thank you for getting us out of the crypts Gendry. OT could of ended badly if you hadn&rsquo;t arrived when you did.&rdquo; Gendry tilted his head as Sansa gripped his arm. &ldquo;This man needs attention and so does my sister please look after their wounds.&rdquo; Sansa ordered a nearby medic. Arya and gendry nodded to her as they limped away and sat down on a cot to get tended too. Sansa watched as they sat close together holding hands as they appeared to whispered something to each other and to sansa&rsquo;s surprised Arya leaned up and kissed him on the lips as he tilted his head to kiss her just as hard. Shocked at what she just witnessed Sansa turned away and thought to herself Arya and the blacksmith she wished she could say this was weird but it has been proven she has seen far more impossible things such as an army of the undead. That was shocking Arya possibly in love with a blacksmith doesn&rsquo;t even make her top five. Later on while she stood next to theon she saw Arya and the blacksmith Gendry sleeping on the same cot or more like clinging to each other but still sleeping. Arya&rsquo;s back was pressed into his chest as his arms were wrapped around her and his face was tucked into her hair. Arya&rsquo;s fingers were intertwined with his as she appeared to have a small smile on her face. </p>",

OT could of ended badly if you hadn\u2019t arrived when you did.\u201d Gendry tilted his head as Sansa gripped his arm. \u201cThis man needs attention and so does my sister please look after their wounds.\u201d Sansa ordered a nearby medic. Arya and gendry nodded to her as they limped away and sat down on a cot to get tended too. Sansa watched as they sat close together holding hands as they appeared to whispered something to each other and to sansa\u2019s surprised Arya leaned up and kissed him on the lips as he tilted his head to kiss her just as hard. Shocked at what she just witnessed Sansa turned away and thought to herself Arya and the blacksmith she wished she could say this was weird but it has been proven she has seen far more impossible things such as an army of the undead. That was shocking Arya possibly in love with a blacksmith doesn\u2019t even make her top five. Later on while she stood next to theon she saw Arya and the blacksmith Gendry sleeping on the same cot or more like clinging to each other but still sleeping. Arya\u2019s back was pressed into his chest as his arms were wrapped around her and his face was tucked into her hair. Arya\u2019s fingers were intertwined with his as she appeared to have a small smile on her face. </p></p>",

He swung his hammer into the face of another wight slamming it to the ground as he pounded its face in. Spinning around he swung his new axe taking off the head of another wight as he fell to his knees. Trying to catch his breathe he willed himself back to his feet as another walker come toward him swinging and he stumbled backwards to avoid getting his bloody head chopped off and as he was falling down another axe appeared out of nowhere catching the walker in the chest as it was thrown back. The hound appeared from behind him walking toward his victim retrieving his axe and turned back toward Gendry. The hound held out his hand as Gendry gripped it and was hauled up back to his feet. The hound looked at his axe glanced back at Gendry and growled \u201cGuess you do know what you\u2019re doing. Axe hasn\u2019t broken yet.\u201d Turned and continued to chop wights in half. Gendry stunned shook his head and ran off toward the crypts since they were no longer safe for the women and children they needed to get them to the boats!</p><p>Running full speed into the crypts Gendry ran/tackled a wight in front of him as he slammed his hammer into it killing it once again and continued on his way. He skidded to a stop as he heard screams and whipped around heading the direction swinging his axe. The women and children were cornered by several wights as Gendry emerged into the room and threw his axe at one and clobbered another as he rushed to protect them. One got the timing and he was thrown into the chambers wall and he slide to the ground in a heap. Swearing to himself he jumped right back up and could feel blood running down his face as he positioned himself between the wights and the women and children. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Arya\u2019s sister lady Sansa as she braced herself against the wall attempting to protect others and gendry moved over to place himself closer to her cause if Arya\u2019s sister died she would probably break completely and he would do anything to prevent that from happening. Yes did she tell him in no small words not to die?! Yes she did and he was absolutely going to try to keep his promise but damn him if he let lady Sansa die down here! </p><p>Swinging his axe and hammer he took out most of them till one got a hit in and stabbed him in the leg and sliced him down his chest! He screamed in pain as he went down dropping his hammer. He looked up as the wight was ready to do the deathblow and stab him when all of a sudden the wights head was chopped off and the body fell to the ground. Gripping his side he looked up to see who finished it off and was looking at Lady Sansa gripping his axe with determination, fear, anger and other emotions in her eyes. She dropped the axe as she rushed over to him and helped him up but he didn\u2019t wait \u201cwe have to leave now! This place is no longer safe for all of you we got to get to the boats now!\u201d Hauling himself up the rest of the way he retrieved his axe from the ground and ushered everyone out of the crypts as fast as he could willing them to move faster! Sansa gripped his hand as she moved in front of him as they ran out of the crypts together. She stopped as he nearly ran into her and she looked back at her home of winterfell as it burned. \u201cMy family is buried here my whole family and now it\u2019s burning to the ground. A stark should always be at winterfell and now there never will be again.\u201d Sansa with tears in her eyes and emotion in her voice. Gendry wasn\u2019t sure what to say and not sound like a total bastard to hurry her out of here so all he could do was tighten his grip on her hand to get her attention back. \u201cNot to sound like an uncaring insensitive bastard but lady Sansa we have to go now. I\u2019m sorry for all of this but we gotta go.\u201d Sansa turned to him and with one final look back she nodded to him as she got a look at all the dead bodies littering the ground around them! It shocked her to her core to see so much death and gendry feared he would have to drag her away and his leg and chest wound were not going to let that happen easily but too bad pain and suffering was something he knew. Out of nowhere theon appeared and Sansa let go of gendrys hand and ran to theon as he grab her hand nodded to him as he pointed behind Gendry at the wights coming up behind him. \u201cGo I will hold them off get her to the ships!\u201d Gendry screamed as he turned to give them time to get away.</p><p>Arya saw Sansa and theon running through the courtyard toward the ships and was relieved to see her sister had survived the wights in the crypts the one area she was running to in order to help get them out. Theon had already done that or so she thought. Looking behind them she saw soldiers fighting off more wights that had broken through and were rushing toward them and amongst those soldiers was a figure she knew very well! Gendry! He was holding off the wights as Sansa and theon ran and Arya without a second thought jumped down into th courtyard and raced toward him. Behind her she heard Sansa yelling at her \u201cArya! No we need to get to the boats now what are you doing?!\u201d Arya ignored her as she raced to gendrys side taking out a walker he didn\u2019t see behind him. Gendry whipped around to see Arya standing beside him her weapon he had made her in her hands as she skillfully took out a walker behind him. He couldn\u2019t help but smile as he saw her beside him but fear spiked his blood as a wight come up behind her and she must of seen the look in his as since she ducked as he swung his axe taking off its head. Spinning around she stood up smiled at him and was ready to battle beside him. Jon was racing down the walls toward the courtyard sounding the retreat to every man he passed the battle was lost it was time to run! He ran toward the courtyard and witnessed Arya, Gendry, the hound, jamie and brienne fighting off the hordes of wights that were never ending. It was the first time he had seen Arya fight and it was damn amazing to watch as she cut down walker and walker as Gendry seemed to read her every move and cut down wights she missed or couldn\u2019t get to in time. They were in sync and their fighting seemed like a dance. \u201cRETREAT! EVERYONE TO THE SHIPS NOW!\u201d Jon screamed at them as he took out his own wight by cutting it in half. He looked toward the crypts and started that way before Gendry and Arya got to him \u201cthe women and children are out! The crypt is empty except for the dead that now have made it their own!\u201d Gendry screamed at him as he and Arya raced by him and he noticed Arya was gripping the blacksmiths hand. Jon joined them as they raced toward the boats as the dragons burned winterfell and the wights to the ground. </p><p>Ships were quickly departing as everyone attempted to get on one in order to leave winterfell as it burned. The battle was lost and no matter what it was a devastating blow to their fight against the night king. Arya, Jon, Sansa, Gendry, bran and theon and dany were on one ship as where jamie, brienne, jorah and the hound were on another one. Arya knew many were dead by at the moment the most important people were alive on the ships. Arya had her arm around Gendry and he had an arm wrapped around her shoulders as they watched her home burn. She didn\u2019t know if it was blood or tears running down her face but it was probably both. She was able to take a closer look at Gendry and was just noticing his wounds and how badly they were bleeding. \u201cWe need to fix your injuries. They are bleeding badly.\u201d Arya told Gendry with concern lacing her words. He tilted her head up he examined the cut on her forehead \u201cyou have an wound that needs tending to as well Arya. Yours first I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He softy spoke as he gazed at her with a concerned look and love. Just as they were about limp over to get tended to Sansa stopped them as she looked at Gendry. \u201cThank you for getting us out of the crypts Gendry. OT could of ended badly if you hadn\u2019t arrived when you did.\u201d Gendry tilted his head as Sansa gripped his arm. \u201cThis man needs attention and so does my sister please look after their wounds.\u201d Sansa ordered a nearby medic.

Usually that would mean I would wish Sansa\u2019s success at the expense of Dany\u2019s, but I like Dany. I\u2019ve seen a lot of anti-Dany posts (which I get, we all have our opinions) and I feel I should defend her.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys isn\u2019t evil. She\u2019s not going to suddenly kill Jon because he has a claim to the throne. It has been established that she and Jon love each other, and yes, Jon\u2019s main concern is\u00a0\u201cHoly fuck I fucked my aunt\u201d while Dany\u2019s is\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck, the Iron throne?\u201d and that does divide them. Jon is concerned that that is her main priority, but it\u2019s not altogether surprising. She\u2019s a Targaryen, it would be normal for her to marry her kin. What is surprising is that she doesn\u2019t automatically assume it would be a good marriage for them, but then again, Jon had been ghosting her all day, so I get that she would be confused.\u00a0</p><p>Dany is a super complex character, just like all the other characters. She\u2019s allowed to be upset by the way things are going at Winterfell, she\u2019s allowed to be unhappy that Cersei is a liar and her advisors didn\u2019t plan for what would happen or that their plans are bad. She\u2019s also allowed to be inexperienced in the North. That\u2019s why she has the advisors. And they sucked lately, which is really bad for her. And the one time she ignored them in S7 was to kill the Tarly\u2019s, which was not a great move, but understandable.\u00a0</p><p>I just see a lot of posts saying that Dany is going to kill Jon, or let him die because he is competition, and that just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. She\u2019s not that person. She likened her love for Jon to the one she had for Khal Drogo, which was intense. But she\u2019s allowed to be suspicious or angry by this news. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve been pretty firm that I don\u2019t believe the Political Jon theories, because it\u2019s really not part of Jon\u2019s character. He isn\u2019t that guy. And I don\u2019t want him to be that guy. I would rather he be an idiot who gave away his kingdom than manipulate a woman to fall in love with him. Because what makes him different from everyone who has manipulated Sansa. (I\u2019m a Jonsa shipper, it\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t want to ship them at the expense of their or someone else\u2019s character.)</p><p>Jon\u2019s journey isn\u2019t to the Throne, I firmly believe that. He would be miserable in Kingslanding and he would likely be killed because he\u2019s an idiot. That said, I\u2019m not sure Dany should take the Iron Throne either, because I don\u2019t think it will give her the happiness and home she seeks, and she doesn\u2019t know how to navigate the realm. That said, obviously Sansa would be the best option, but I\u2019m all about the Northern independence route, so&hellip; not going to happen for her either.\u00a0</p><p>So I went off a bit on a tangent, but anyway&hellip;.
