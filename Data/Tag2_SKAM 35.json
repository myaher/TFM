I was homeschooled a large majority of my life so I tend to be considered \u201cstrange\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d At the beginning of high school, I lost my entire circle of friends. They all left and I had no idea why. At that time, I was also struggling with my own problems. I had dealt with major depression and family issues, and the fact that none of my friends seemed to care or even ask what\u2019s wrong every once and a while had really hurt. I know that I wasn\u2019t the kindest person, but when you\u2019re struggling with your own issues, you don\u2019t really notice the pain you inflict on others. I was always angry and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself, but my hatred and disliking towards others wasn\u2019t because I actually had a problem with them, it was because I had a problem with myself. At this rate, the girl squad is the last thing Imane needs right now. What Imane needs is a break from school, from home, from family, and anything else that might distract her or stress her out, and she needs to focus on how she can better herself and fix her problems. She won\u2019t be able to fix anything with the girls as long as her issues continue to grow. I\u2019m extremely angry with the girl squad for how uncouth they\u2019ve been, and how little they seem to care about Imanes feelings, but Imane shouldn\u2019t need to worry about them right now. They all have their own problems that need working out, and once they\u2019ve done that, hopefully they can come back to each other and talk like actual adults rather than teenagers who have a bunch of mental instability issues. I don\u2019t like how things are turning out, but I hope things go better for Imane than how they did for me. I wish someone could go and tell her that she\u2019s not a horrible person, and everyone makes mistakes. There was no harm intended behind any of the actions she took, and I wish the girls would open up their eyes and stop being blinded by Ingrid for just a few moments. They better works things out quick, because we have 2 episodes, and I don\u2019t know how much more I can handle. </p>",

I was thinking that when Eliott was fighting with Lucas, he would  definitely post a drawing on his insta, like that is just what he does. S3 Eliott would have definitely done it. It seems like they only prepped drawings for season 3 and now I guess Eliott doesn't draw anymore? And all their photos are from the same place",
        "answer": "<p>yes exactly, i mean of course the main focus isn\u2019t on lucas anymore and especially not on eliott but those twice a month updates are really weird, sometimes it really feels like characters don\u2019t exist anymore. and it\u2019s so true eliott would have drawn something for sure. and yeah it\u2019s only two episodes left so i don\u2019t think that he will suddenly post a drawing, which is so strange? because it\u2019s quite easy to ask to do more. and yes about pics from the same place lmao, anyway i hope if we get more seasons they would do a better job with social media content in the future\u00a0</p>",
