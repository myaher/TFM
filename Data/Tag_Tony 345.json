Honey.\u201d</p><p>\tStephen turned, his face mashed and wrinkled from its night spent pressed into Tony\u2019s three-million thread count sheets. \u201cMm? Wha\u2019s it? Time?\u201d</p><p>\tTony chuckled softly, rolling his eyes as he pressed his lips to Stephen\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou wanna try that one again, hot stuff?\u201d</p><p>\tStephen blinked a few more times, clearing the sleep from his vision. He finally managed to focus on Tony\u2019s face smiling down at him. He smelled like coffee - he\u2019d been up for a bit, then - and his eyes were warm and melty with affection. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNearly ten,\u201d Tony answered, stroking a hand through Stephen\u2019s messy bedhead. \u201cGod, you\u2019re somethin\u2019 else in the morning, yknow?\u201d He said softly. \u201cSo soft.

They\u2019d had to square off against some intergalactic marauders the day before. The band of robbers had heard about some sort of massive diamond located on Earth, when in reality it was located on a <i>completely different planet</i> called Aerth. A simple typo into their ship\u2019s computer. Not the brightest bunch in the galaxy, but definitely one of the better armed.</p><p>\tStephen had gotten pretty friendly with quite a few museum walls, which led to the very angry bruise along his side and shooting pain in his chest as he sat up. \u201cOoh\u2026 Yep, that\u2019s - those are broken.\u201d</p><p>\tTony tsked quietly, helping Stephen up and out of bed. \u201cThere we go, sugar. Nice and easy. Just down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\tTony guided Stephen into a medbay, laying him back and bringing his scanner over. \u201cJust gotta see where the fracture\u2019s at\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tFRIDAY assisted as Tony scanned over Stephen\u2019s body, ensuring there wasn\u2019t any puncturing or fluid build up. Finding none, he gave Stephen some painkillers and sat him back up. \u201cNothing more to do but let it set and heal,\u201d he said quietly. He had his hands on Stephen\u2019s knees, squeezing gently as he looked his lover over one more time. He paused, his breath catching a bit.</p><p>\tThey had dangerous jobs. That was the name of the game. But it still made his heart skip a beat when he realized just how close he\u2019d come to losing Stephen again every time they ended up in a fight like that. </p><p>\tHe took in every little scar that dotted Stephen\u2019s body - over his torso, on his arms, on his thighs, and the knotted scars on each of his fingers. </p><p>\tThey\u2019d survived.</p><p>\tThey\u2019d lived.</p><p>\t\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>\tTony looked up, shaking his head imperceptibly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust\u2026 thinking,\u201d Tony answered, smiling a bit. \u201cCan I just - ?\u201d</p><p>\tHe stepped between Stephen\u2019s legs, pressing his lips to the scar across his collarbone. He kissed it gently, taking his time to smooth his lips over every part. He moved on to the ones over his shoulders, the ones over his pecs. He knelt to kiss his thighs, making sure every scar got the attention it deserved.</p><p>\t\u201cTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>\tHe stood back up and took Stephen\u2019s face in his hands, tenderly kissing the scars on his temples, his cheeks, through his eyebrows. He kissed his lips, resting their foreheads together.</p><p>\t\u201cI just\u2026 I gotta remember\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tStephen watched as Tony dipped down again, taking his trembling hands in his calloused, steady ones. He swallowed as the other man\u2019s breath ghosted over his shaky, damaged fingers.</p><p>\t\u201cI gotta remember how precious you are to me. How beautiful your body is,\u201d Tony murmured. \u201cHow many times I\u2026 what we\u2019ve been through\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tTony brought Stephen\u2019s hands to his lips, kissing every inch of the scars on his hands. The scars that made him the man he was now, that brought he and Stephen\u2019s lives together. These scars were his Stephen. And they were gorgeous, and they were devastating, and they were memories. Marks of history.</p><p>\t\u201cCome up here,\u201d came Stephen\u2019s voice.</p><p>\tTony looked up, feeling Stephen\u2019s hands tug at the bottom of his shirt and pull it over his head. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ve got them, too. You\u2019ve got them, too.\u201d</p><p>\tStephen slowly slid off of the examination table, bending as much as he could to kiss the massive scar in the center of Tony\u2019s chest. Tony rested his head against Stephen\u2019s as he felt the other man\u2019s lips dance over his skin, feeling every ounce of love and affection that Stephen had pouring into his thick, tough skin.</p><p>\t\u201cSteph.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m right here, Tony. We both are.\u201d </p><p>\tThey spent a bit longer in each other\u2019s arms, making love with their mouths against one another\u2019s flesh. Tony eventually started to laugh, pulling away.</p><p>\t\u201cSorry. Got a bit - carried away, there.\u201d</p><p>\tStephen chuckled quietly, kissing Tony\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize for making me feel good. I certainly won\u2019t apologize for doing the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\tTony smiled, wrapping his arms loosely around Stephen\u2019s waist. \u201cC\u2019mon. I made coffee, and I can make us some breakfast to go with it, hm?\u201d</p><p>\tStephen nodded. \u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>\tTony slid his hand into Stephen\u2019s, feeling the scars against his skin. The history of where they\u2019d been, and who they\u2019d become, kept like a tapestry on the canvas of their bodies.</p><p>\tTheir scars made them beautiful.</p><p>\tTheir scars made them Iron Man and Doctor Strange.</p><p>\tTheir scars made them Stephen and Tony.</p><p>\tTheir scars made them who they were.</p>",

Time?\u201d</p><p>\tTony chuckled softly, rolling his eyes as he pressed his lips to Stephen\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou wanna try that one again, hot stuff?\u201d</p><p>\tStephen blinked a few more times, clearing the sleep from his vision. He finally managed to focus on Tony\u2019s face smiling down at him. He smelled like coffee - he\u2019d been up for a bit, then - and his eyes were warm and melty with affection. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNearly ten,\u201d Tony answered, stroking a hand through Stephen\u2019s messy bedhead. \u201cGod, you\u2019re somethin\u2019 else in the morning, yknow?\u201d He said softly. \u201cSo soft. My widdle Stephie.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, widdle Stephie?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\tTony laughed again, his <i>real</i> laugh, not the one he put on in front of crowds of people, or had in his back pocket for when senators and donors came to call. \u201cOkay, baby, I\u2019m done. <i>Anyway</i>, as much as I love you getting the sleep you need, you had a pretty tough day yesterday, and I need to have a gander at those ribs,\u201d he said quietly, putting a hand on Stephen\u2019s bare shoulder.</p><p>\tStephen blinked again, remembering. They\u2019d had to square off against some intergalactic marauders the day before. The band of robbers had heard about some sort of massive diamond located on Earth, when in reality it was located on a <i>completely different planet</i> called Aerth. A simple typo into their ship\u2019s computer. Not the brightest bunch in the galaxy, but definitely one of the better armed.</p><p>\tStephen had gotten pretty friendly with quite a few museum walls, which led to the very angry bruise along his side and shooting pain in his chest as he sat up. \u201cOoh\u2026 Yep, that\u2019s - those are broken.\u201d</p><p>\tTony tsked quietly, helping Stephen up and out of bed. \u201cThere we go, sugar. Nice and easy. Just down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\tTony guided Stephen into a medbay, laying him back and bringing his scanner over. \u201cJust gotta see where the fracture\u2019s at\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tFRIDAY assisted as Tony scanned over Stephen\u2019s body, ensuring there wasn\u2019t any puncturing or fluid build up. Finding none, he gave Stephen some painkillers and sat him back up. \u201cNothing more to do but let it set and heal,\u201d he said quietly. He had his hands on Stephen\u2019s knees, squeezing gently as he looked his lover over one more time. He paused, his breath catching a bit.</p><p>\tThey had dangerous jobs. That was the name of the game. But it still made his heart skip a beat when he realized just how close he\u2019d come to losing Stephen again every time they ended up in a fight like that. </p><p>\tHe took in every little scar that dotted Stephen\u2019s body - over his torso, on his arms, on his thighs, and the knotted scars on each of his fingers. </p><p>\tThey\u2019d survived.</p><p>\tThey\u2019d lived.</p><p>\t\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>\tTony looked up, shaking his head imperceptibly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, buttercup?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJust\u2026 thinking,\u201d Tony answered, smiling a bit. \u201cCan I just - ?\u201d</p><p>\tHe stepped between Stephen\u2019s legs, pressing his lips to the scar across his collarbone. He kissed it gently, taking his time to smooth his lips over every part. He moved on to the ones over his shoulders, the ones over his pecs. He knelt to kiss his thighs, making sure every scar got the attention it deserved.</p><p>\t\u201cTony\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>\tHe stood back up and took Stephen\u2019s face in his hands, tenderly kissing the scars on his temples, his cheeks, through his eyebrows. He kissed his lips, resting their foreheads together.</p><p>\t\u201cI just\u2026 I gotta remember\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tStephen watched as Tony dipped down again, taking his trembling hands in his calloused, steady ones. He swallowed as the other man\u2019s breath ghosted over his shaky, damaged fingers.</p><p>\t\u201cI gotta remember how precious you are to me. How beautiful your body is,\u201d Tony murmured. \u201cHow many times I\u2026 what we\u2019ve been through\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tTony brought Stephen\u2019s hands to his lips, kissing every inch of the scars on his hands. The scars that made him the man he was now, that brought he and Stephen\u2019s lives together. These scars were his Stephen. And they were gorgeous, and they were devastating, and they were memories. Marks of history.</p><p>\t\u201cCome up here,\u201d came Stephen\u2019s voice.</p><p>\tTony looked up, feeling Stephen\u2019s hands tug at the bottom of his shirt and pull it over his head. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ve got them, too.

The man you loved had even planned on asking you to marry him, but he found someone\u00a0\u2018better\u2019 and dropped you quicker than you could ask why.\u00a0</p><p>The last three years have been lonely; you have to admit that going out on a date every once in awhile wasn\u2019t the best. You couldn\u2019t find the right person for you.\u00a0</p><p>Work was busy this week, and your neck throbbed from all the concentration. You were sure there were multiple stress knots lodged in the sides of your neck.\u00a0</p><p>Slipping off your shoes, you fix yourself a big glass of wine and make your way to the couch, getting comfortable in the soft plush cushions.\u00a0</p><p>Your phone dings, and you let out a small groan, dreading the text from your boss saying she needs you back at the office ASAP.\u00a0</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t your boss. In fact, it was an old friend - a very old friend - one you had been close with since the early stages of childhood. Tony Stark.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Happy birthday, old woman - big 35 - thinking of you. Hope you have/had a great night. Don\u2019t party too hard. ~Tony\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>A gasp escapes your mouth as you read. You had completely forgotten that it was your birthday. Your stunned state only grows when you remember the\u00a0\u2018pact\u2019 you had made with Tony when you were mere young, foolish teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>__________</p><p><i>It was the last day of school, and Tony was walking you to your bus, per usual. His cockiness even during middle school was unbelievable; the way he would strut down the sidewalk winking at almost every girl made it hard to focus.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, let\u2019s make a deal. I say - no I </i>propose <i>- that if we\u2019re both single when we reach 35, then we get married. We\u2019ve been best friends forever, we could pull it off. What do ya say?\u201d Tony inquired, turning his head to look at you.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Grasping the strap of your book bag, you watch the road as you walk, Tony\u2019s proposition running through your thoughts. </i>Being married to Tony wouldn\u2019t be the <i>worst </i>thing in the world, <i>you thought to yourself.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, considering how you are with girls, Tony, I highly doubt you\u2019ll be single by then. So sure, I\u2019ll accept your proposition.\u201d You smile at him, completely sure of the fact that you would never actually have to go through with this &hellip; deal.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Tony stops you right outside your bus, slapping a hand on your shoulder and kissing your cheek.\u00a0\u201cPerfect! I\u2019ll call you tomorrow - see if we can hang out.\u201d He gives you a sly wink and walks off, leaving you to a silent bus ride home, only thinking of him.\u00a0</i></p><p>__________</p><p>You leap off your couch and change into loose yoga pants and a t-shirt, fixing your makeup. It was time to find out if Tony remembered the pact or not.\u00a0</p><p>Shooting him a quick text, you let him know you\u2019re coming for a visit and run down to your car.\u00a0</p><p>A few short moments later, you arrive at the extravagant Avengers compound, the building lit up in all its glory before you. It was unbelievable how successful Tony was; which almost made this deal even more appealing. Fancy dresses, dinner parties, and press interviews seemed like a glamorous life, especially if you spent it right next to your charming, lifelong best friend.\u00a0</p><p>Walking in, your eyes sweep across the entirety of the first floor, nearly jumping out of your skin when a helicarrier takes off right next to the building. You feel your eyes grow wide with curiosity as you make your way to the small group of people chatting in the lobby area. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Mr. Stark, please,\u201d you smile, the only lady there turning to look at you. She was beautiful; creamy complexion with dark red hair and green eyes that pierce your soul. You were taken aback by her beauty. </p><p>\u201cAh, you must be the birthday girl,\u201d the woman says with a soft smile, \u201cI\u2019m N-\u201d </p><p>\u201cNatasha Romanoff \u2026 part of the Avengers. You\u2019re even more beautiful in person. I-I\u2019ve seen what you can do, you\u2019re amazing.\u201d You gush, causing Natasha\u2019s cheeks to grow a paler shade of red. </p><p>\u201cWell thank you, y/n, maybe I could teach you a few things sometime. Tony\u2019s on his floor, go to the elevator and press the 4.\u201d She instructs, giving you a slightly bigger smile than before. You could tell this was the beginning of a new friendship, and you couldn\u2019t wait for what came next. </p><p>The elegant elevator ride up to Tony\u2019s floor is surprisingly silent - no music, which you were glad about. It let you have some time to think about what you were going to say when you reached his room. </p><p>As the doors opened, you were wowed by Tony\u2019s floor. Black glass floor tiles, with dark grey and white accent tones along each wall. Elegant as well, just as you expected \u2026 but in a way, even better. You couldn\u2019t help the huge smile plastered across your face. </p><p>\u201cTony?! Where are you?\u201d you call out, sweeping the room for your best friend. </p><p>Just then, Tony turns the corner, wearing a suit per usual, a smile spread from ear to ear. </p><p>\u201cY/N! There she is! Wow I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d he says, giving you a peck on the cheek, \u201cYou look incredible even in sweatpants - how do you pull it off?\u201d Tony\u2019s chuckle makes you emit a small giggle as he takes your hand gently and kisses the back of your palm. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood tonight, Tony, it\u2019s actually kind of crazy!\u201d </p><p>Tony leads you to the outdoor area of the building, a small table set up with champagne, a few deep red roses, and two plates with extravagant cake placed neatly on top of each one. </p><p>\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d you whisper. No one had ever done something like this for you before, but deep down you didn\u2019t expect any less from Tony. </p><p>You feel Tony\u2019s eyes on you and turn to him, meeting his eyes. The deep brown eyes you\u2019re staring into are clouded with something that could only be adoration, you figure, as he looks at you like you\u2019re the cutest thing he\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tony asks, his voice having a softer edge to it now. His eyes still haven\u2019t left your figure as he pulls your chair out for you to sit. </p><p>\u201cOh my - thank you,\u201d you blush, taking a seat and smiling when he pushes you in gently. </p><p>Tony hums a simple \u2018mhmmm\u2019 and walks to his side of the table, placing himself in the chair across from you. At this time of night, all the stars are out and the sky is clear. You couldn\u2019t help but be impressed with everything here. </p><p>\u201cSo I wanted to try something new - make us feel like we\u2019re still young and wild, y\u2019know? The cake flavor is chocolate but with raspberry icing - figured it\u2019d be a nice twist.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice pulls you from your stargazing, and your ears practically perk up when he says \u2018chocolate\u2019 and \u2018raspberry\u2019. </p><p>\u201cTwo of my favorite flavors!\u201d you exclaim, unsure as to why you\u2019re shocked \u2026 it\u2019s Tony, he remembers almost <i>everything</i> anyone tells him. </p><p>Tony lets out a chuckle as he takes a bite, closing his eyes and practically moaning in response. </p><p>\u201cDamn, Louisa did a good job with this one.\u201d Tony had a maid or cook for almost every occasion, which was a bit much for you but you figured it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to adjust to. </p><p>After almost all the cake was gone, you lean back in your chair, crossing one leg over the other. Your eyes avoid Tony\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cTony do you remember uhh \u2026 wow this sounds so stup-\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, y/n? Hesitation - I don\u2019t like it - makes my anxiety fuckin\u2019 skyrocket.\u201d he laughs half-heartedly, trying to play off his concern. </p><p>With a sigh, you move your eyes to meet Tony\u2019s. \u201cDo you remember the deal we made? When we were 13?\u201d </p><p>After a moment, Tony shakes his head. \u201cDrawing\u2019 a blank here, y/l/n, what \u2018deal\u2019?\u201d </p><p>You felt the hinges crack loose on the structure of your heart, it seeming to dangle dangerously on thin rope now. </p><p>\u201cUhm \u2026\u201d you clear your throat, \u201cthe day you walked me to the bus you said if we were still single at 35, we should get married. To be bluntly honest, I was excited; I thought that\u2019s why you texted me happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyebrows raise and he looks at you with a cheeky smile. He\u2019s not taking this seriously and you\u2019re beginning to panic. </p><p>\u201cY/n, that whole deal was a joke.\u201d Tony laughs under his breath, \u201cdid you really think we\u2019d go through with it? Did either of us truly believe I\u2019d be single by now?\u201d </p><p>With a quick nod of embarrassment you stand and start gathering your things. This had quickly turned into <i>the</i> worst birthday ever. </p><p>\u201cRight \u2026 sorry for barging in and assuming things. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Your voice is seeping with anger and hurt, a feeling Tony knew all too well but never expected from you. </p><p>He stands to keep you from leaving, a stunned expression crossing his face. </p><p>\u201cSo, what, y/n, are you - do you <i>love</i> me or something?!\u201d his question is laced with nervous energy, his voice shaking a bit. </p><p>Tears pool in your eyes, threatening to spill over as Tony says \u2018love\u2019. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you whisper, your voice growing louder as your emotions build, \u201cYes, I love you. I asked myself that question multiple times even as a teenager. You just - it was like I couldn\u2019t get enough of you, Tony.\u201d </p><p>Tony is staring at you in complete disbelief. None of his previous flinds have ever ended in \u2018I love you\u2019, and this wasn\u2019t even a fling \u2026 you were his best friend.</p><p>\u201cY/n \u2026 I-I have no idea what you want me to say. I don\u2019t - my job and my lifestyle is <i>dangerous</i> now. I can\u2019t have you so close to all of this. Besides, you\u2019re my best friend. I mean - yeah sure, I\u2019ve thought about a relationship with you before, but honestly, y/n, you deserve better.\u201d </p><p>A bitter laugh escapes your body and tears stream down your face. The rope holding your heart up safely was just cut, and you\u2019re drowning, clawing like a cat for any bit of hope you can find. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want \u2018<i>better</i>\u2019, Tony, I want <i>you</i>. I\u2019ve known you almost my whole life - hell, I probably know you better than you know <i>yourself</i>. You\u2019re just making excuses and pushing me away because you\u2019re scared of a God damn commitment, even though you <i>know</i> I\u2019ll never leave. I don\u2019t care how \u2018dangerous\u2019 it is.\u201d </p><p>Tony opens his mouth to speak, but you cut him off before he has the change. </p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t wanna hear another lame excuse. Sorry to waste your time. And thanks for the cake,\u201d you spit out, turning and making your way back to the car. </p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Tony mumbles as he watches you lay your head on the steering wheel. Just as he makes the decision to run after you, your car roars to life and his shoulders drop as you speed away. He wondered if you were gone for good. </p><p>__________</p><p>Days pass, and you haven\u2019t heard a single thing from Tony. You weren\u2019t angry anymore \u2026 sadness replaced your fury. </p><p>Work kept you busy, restraining you from thinking dangerously; <i>how could you be so foolish? He\u2019d never love you. You\u2019re just his best friend. </i></p><p>You were greeted by your dog when you got home, and you were too tired and lazy to fix dinner so you ordered pizza for delivery. </p><p>Feeling a little generous, you tipped the delivery man extra when he arrived. Your blankets welcomes you as you clutched the pizza box and started the last season of Friends. </p><p>Two slices in, your phone buzzed three times. A friend from work had asked for your number today, so you pick it up, assuming it was them. What you found instead were 3 new messages from Tony. </p><p><i>I want this.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I want us.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I want you.</i></p><p>3 simple texts that set your soul on fire. 3 simple texts you never expected to receive. </p><p>Wrapping up the rest of the pizza, you make it back to the compound in less than 5 minutes; running 2 red lights isn\u2019t that bad, right? </p><p>The elevator seems to move extremely slow as it floats up to Tony\u2019s floor. It\u2019s silent except for the nervous tapping of your foot. </p><p>The ding of the elevator snaps you back, and you practically pry open the doors. You run into Tony less than a second after you step off the elevator. He was waiting for you. </p><p>Tony waists no time, grabbing your waist and walking you back into the wall. </p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d he growls lowly, nibbling your ear and lightly sucking on your neck. </p><p>You let out a gasp, your skin aching for more of Tony\u2019s touch. Your heart was already beating out of its chest. </p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help the flow of traff-\u201d your words were cut off by Tony\u2019s lips roughly meeting yours, his teeth tugging at your bottom lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shut up.\u201d </i>He commands. A moan rises from you, only fueling tony even more. His hands traveled under your shirt, wandering all over your body.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Each time Tony touched you, it felt like tiny zaps of electricity tingling through your body. The two of you couldn\u2019t get enough of each other, and you eventually wound up in Tony\u2019s silk sheets, completely naked before him. </p><p>\u201cMy <i>God</i> you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Tony said, four little words that rang through your head as the night full of pleasures continued. </p><p>__________</p><p>Hours later, once you\u2019ve managed to calm yourself and relax once again, Tony pulls you on top of him, your body pressed tightly against his. </p><p>Your fingers trace random patterns on his chest as his do the same to your back. </p><p>\u201cYou are \u2026 <i>truly</i> remarkable - there are no words to describe you.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice is soft and soothing, yet full of adoration. </p><p>Unable to help yourself, you giggle and plant a kiss on his chest. </p><p>\u201cThat was undoubtedly the best night of my life.\u201d </p><p>Tony is unable to contain his joy, a smile spreading ear to ear across his face. His hand snakes under your chin, tilting your face up to look at him. </p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he whispers, kissing you softly. </p><p>You pull away, radiating pure joy as you rub your thumb across his cheekbone. </p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p>",

The man you loved had even planned on asking you to marry him, but he found someone\u00a0\u2018better\u2019 and dropped you quicker than you could ask why.\u00a0</p><p>The last three years have been lonely; you have to admit that going out on a date every once in awhile wasn\u2019t the best. You couldn\u2019t find the right person for you.\u00a0</p><p>Work was busy this week, and your neck throbbed from all the concentration. You were sure there were multiple stress knots lodged in the sides of your neck.\u00a0</p><p>Slipping off your shoes, you fix yourself a big glass of wine and make your way to the couch, getting comfortable in the soft plush cushions.\u00a0</p><p>Your phone dings, and you let out a small groan, dreading the text from your boss saying she needs you back at the office ASAP.\u00a0</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t your boss. In fact, it was an old friend - a very old friend - one you had been close with since the early stages of childhood. Tony Stark.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Happy birthday, old woman - big 35 - thinking of you. Hope you have/had a great night.

Your stunned state only grows when you remember the\u00a0\u2018pact\u2019 you had made with Tony when you were mere young, foolish teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>__________</p><p><i>It was the last day of school, and Tony was walking you to your bus, per usual.

What do ya say?\u201d Tony inquired, turning his head to look at you.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Grasping the strap of your book bag, you watch the road as you walk, Tony\u2019s proposition running through your thoughts. </i>Being married to Tony wouldn\u2019t be the <i>worst </i>thing in the world, <i>you thought to yourself.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, considering how you are with girls, Tony, I highly doubt you\u2019ll be single by then. So sure, I\u2019ll accept your proposition.\u201d You smile at him, completely sure of the fact that you would never actually have to go through with this \u2026 deal.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Tony stops you right outside your bus, slapping a hand on your shoulder and kissing your cheek.\u00a0\u201cPerfect! I\u2019ll call you tomorrow - see if we can hang out.\u201d He gives you a sly wink and walks off, leaving you to a silent bus ride home, only thinking of him.\u00a0</i></p><p>__________</p><p>You leap off your couch and change into loose yoga pants and a t-shirt, fixing your makeup. It was time to find out if Tony remembered the pact or not.\u00a0</p><p>Shooting him a quick text, you let him know you\u2019re coming for a visit and run down to your car.\u00a0</p><p>A few short moments later, you arrive at the extravagant Avengers compound, the building lit up in all its glory before you. It was unbelievable how successful Tony was; which almost made this deal even more appealing. Fancy dresses, dinner parties, and press interviews seemed like a glamorous life, especially if you spent it right next to your charming, lifelong best friend.\u00a0</p><p>Walking in, your eyes sweep across the entirety of the first floor, nearly jumping out of your skin when a helicarrier takes off right next to the building. You feel your eyes grow wide with curiosity as you make your way to the small group of people chatting in the lobby area. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Mr. Stark, please,\u201d you smile, the only lady there turning to look at you.

The man you loved had even planned on asking you to marry him, but he found someone\u00a0\u2018better\u2019 and dropped you quicker than you could ask why.\u00a0</p><p>The last three years have been lonely; you have to admit that going out on a date every once in awhile wasn\u2019t the best. You couldn\u2019t find the right person for you.\u00a0</p><p>Work was busy this week, and your neck throbbed from all the concentration. You were sure there were multiple stress knots lodged in the sides of your neck.\u00a0</p><p>Slipping off your shoes, you fix yourself a big glass of wine and make your way to the couch, getting comfortable in the soft plush cushions.\u00a0</p><p>Your phone dings, and you let out a small groan, dreading the text from your boss saying she needs you back at the office ASAP.\u00a0</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t your boss. In fact, it was an old friend - a very old friend - one you had been close with since the early stages of childhood. Tony Stark.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Happy birthday, old woman - big 35 - thinking of you. Hope you have/had a great night. Don\u2019t party too hard. ~Tony\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>A gasp escapes your mouth as you read. You had completely forgotten that it was your birthday. Your stunned state only grows when you remember the\u00a0\u2018pact\u2019 you had made with Tony when you were mere young, foolish teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>__________</p><p><i>It was the last day of school, and Tony was walking you to your bus, per usual. His cockiness even during middle school was unbelievable; the way he would strut down the sidewalk winking at almost every girl made it hard to focus.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, let\u2019s make a deal. I say - no I </i>propose <i>- that if we\u2019re both single when we reach 35, then we get married. We\u2019ve been best friends forever, we could pull it off. What do ya say?\u201d Tony inquired, turning his head to look at you.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Grasping the strap of your book bag, you watch the road as you walk, Tony\u2019s proposition running through your thoughts. </i>Being married to Tony wouldn\u2019t be the <i>worst </i>thing in the world, <i>you thought to yourself.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, considering how you are with girls, Tony, I highly doubt you\u2019ll be single by then. So sure, I\u2019ll accept your proposition.\u201d You smile at him, completely sure of the fact that you would never actually have to go through with this \u2026 deal.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Tony stops you right outside your bus, slapping a hand on your shoulder and kissing your cheek.\u00a0\u201cPerfect! I\u2019ll call you tomorrow - see if we can hang out.\u201d He gives you a sly wink and walks off, leaving you to a silent bus ride home, only thinking of him.\u00a0</i></p><p>__________</p><p>You leap off your couch and change into loose yoga pants and a t-shirt, fixing your makeup. It was time to find out if Tony remembered the pact or not.\u00a0</p><p>Shooting him a quick text, you let him know you\u2019re coming for a visit and run down to your car.\u00a0</p><p>A few short moments later, you arrive at the extravagant Avengers compound, the building lit up in all its glory before you. It was unbelievable how successful Tony was; which almost made this deal even more appealing. Fancy dresses, dinner parties, and press interviews seemed like a glamorous life, especially if you spent it right next to your charming, lifelong best friend.\u00a0</p><p>Walking in, your eyes sweep across the entirety of the first floor, nearly jumping out of your skin when a helicarrier takes off right next to the building. You feel your eyes grow wide with curiosity as you make your way to the small group of people chatting in the lobby area. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Mr. Stark, please,\u201d you smile, the only lady there turning to look at you. She was beautiful; creamy complexion with dark red hair and green eyes that pierce your soul. You were taken aback by her beauty. </p><p>\u201cAh, you must be the birthday girl,\u201d the woman says with a soft smile, \u201cI\u2019m N-\u201d </p><p>\u201cNatasha Romanoff \u2026 part of the Avengers. You\u2019re even more beautiful in person. I-I\u2019ve seen what you can do, you\u2019re amazing.\u201d You gush, causing Natasha\u2019s cheeks to grow a paler shade of red. </p><p>\u201cWell thank you, y/n, maybe I could teach you a few things sometime. Tony\u2019s on his floor, go to the elevator and press the 4.\u201d She instructs, giving you a slightly bigger smile than before. You could tell this was the beginning of a new friendship, and you couldn\u2019t wait for what came next. </p><p>The elegant elevator ride up to Tony\u2019s floor is surprisingly silent - no music, which you were glad about. It let you have some time to think about what you were going to say when you reached his room. </p><p>As the doors opened, you were wowed by Tony\u2019s floor. Black glass floor tiles, with dark grey and white accent tones along each wall. Elegant as well, just as you expected \u2026 but in a way, even better. You couldn\u2019t help the huge smile plastered across your face. </p><p>\u201cTony?! Where are you?\u201d you call out, sweeping the room for your best friend. </p><p>Just then, Tony turns the corner, wearing a suit per usual, a smile spread from ear to ear. </p><p>\u201cY/N! There she is! Wow I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d he says, giving you a peck on the cheek, \u201cYou look incredible even in sweatpants - how do you pull it off?\u201d Tony\u2019s chuckle makes you emit a small giggle as he takes your hand gently and kisses the back of your palm. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood tonight, Tony, it\u2019s actually kind of crazy!\u201d </p><p>Tony leads you to the outdoor area of the building, a small table set up with champagne, a few deep red roses, and two plates with extravagant cake placed neatly on top of each one. </p><p>\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d you whisper. No one had ever done something like this for you before, but deep down you didn\u2019t expect any less from Tony. </p><p>You feel Tony\u2019s eyes on you and turn to him, meeting his eyes. The deep brown eyes you\u2019re staring into are clouded with something that could only be adoration, you figure, as he looks at you like you\u2019re the cutest thing he\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tony asks, his voice having a softer edge to it now. His eyes still haven\u2019t left your figure as he pulls your chair out for you to sit. </p><p>\u201cOh my - thank you,\u201d you blush, taking a seat and smiling when he pushes you in gently. </p><p>Tony hums a simple \u2018mhmmm\u2019 and walks to his side of the table, placing himself in the chair across from you. At this time of night, all the stars are out and the sky is clear. You couldn\u2019t help but be impressed with everything here. </p><p>\u201cSo I wanted to try something new - make us feel like we\u2019re still young and wild, y\u2019know? The cake flavor is chocolate but with raspberry icing - figured it\u2019d be a nice twist.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice pulls you from your stargazing, and your ears practically perk up when he says \u2018chocolate\u2019 and \u2018raspberry\u2019. </p><p>\u201cTwo of my favorite flavors!\u201d you exclaim, unsure as to why you\u2019re shocked \u2026 it\u2019s Tony, he remembers almost <i>everything</i> anyone tells him. </p><p>Tony lets out a chuckle as he takes a bite, closing his eyes and practically moaning in response. </p><p>\u201cDamn, Louisa did a good job with this one.\u201d Tony had a maid or cook for almost every occasion, which was a bit much for you but you figured it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to adjust to. </p><p>After almost all the cake was gone, you lean back in your chair, crossing one leg over the other. Your eyes avoid Tony\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cTony do you remember uhh \u2026 wow this sounds so stup-\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is it, y/n? Hesitation - I don\u2019t like it - makes my anxiety fuckin\u2019 skyrocket.\u201d he laughs half-heartedly, trying to play off his concern. </p><p>With a sigh, you move your eyes to meet Tony\u2019s. \u201cDo you remember the deal we made? When we were 13?\u201d </p><p>After a moment, Tony shakes his head. \u201cDrawing\u2019 a blank here, y/l/n, what \u2018deal\u2019?\u201d </p><p>You felt the hinges crack loose on the structure of your heart, it seeming to dangle dangerously on thin rope now. </p><p>\u201cUhm \u2026\u201d you clear your throat, \u201cthe day you walked me to the bus you said if we were still single at 35, we should get married. To be bluntly honest, I was excited; I thought that\u2019s why you texted me happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyebrows raise and he looks at you with a cheeky smile. He\u2019s not taking this seriously and you\u2019re beginning to panic. </p><p>\u201cY/n, that whole deal was a joke.\u201d Tony laughs under his breath, \u201cdid you really think we\u2019d go through with it? Did either of us truly believe I\u2019d be single by now?\u201d </p><p>With a quick nod of embarrassment you stand and start gathering your things. This had quickly turned into <i>the</i> worst birthday ever. </p><p>\u201cRight \u2026 sorry for barging in and assuming things. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Your voice is seeping with anger and hurt, a feeling Tony knew all too well but never expected from you. </p><p>He stands to keep you from leaving, a stunned expression crossing his face. </p><p>\u201cSo, what, y/n, are you - do you <i>love</i> me or something?!\u201d his question is laced with nervous energy, his voice shaking a bit. </p><p>Tears pool in your eyes, threatening to spill over as Tony says \u2018love\u2019. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you whisper, your voice growing louder as your emotions build, \u201cYes, I love you. I asked myself that question multiple times even as a teenager. You just - it was like I couldn\u2019t get enough of you, Tony.\u201d </p><p>Tony is staring at you in complete disbelief. None of his previous flinds have ever ended in \u2018I love you\u2019, and this wasn\u2019t even a fling \u2026 you were his best friend.</p><p>\u201cY/n \u2026 I-I have no idea what you want me to say. I don\u2019t - my job and my lifestyle is <i>dangerous</i> now. I can\u2019t have you so close to all of this. Besides, you\u2019re my best friend. I mean - yeah sure, I\u2019ve thought about a relationship with you before, but honestly, y/n, you deserve better.\u201d </p><p>A bitter laugh escapes your body and tears stream down your face. The rope holding your heart up safely was just cut, and you\u2019re drowning, clawing like a cat for any bit of hope you can find. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want \u2018<i>better</i>\u2019, Tony, I want <i>you</i>. I\u2019ve known you almost my whole life - hell, I probably know you better than you know <i>yourself</i>. You\u2019re just making excuses and pushing me away because you\u2019re scared of a God damn commitment, even though you <i>know</i> I\u2019ll never leave. I don\u2019t care how \u2018dangerous\u2019 it is.\u201d </p><p>Tony opens his mouth to speak, but you cut him off before he has the change. </p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t wanna hear another lame excuse. Sorry to waste your time. And thanks for the cake,\u201d you spit out, turning and making your way back to the car. </p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Tony mumbles as he watches you lay your head on the steering wheel. Just as he makes the decision to run after you, your car roars to life and his shoulders drop as you speed away. He wondered if you were gone for good. </p><p>__________</p><p>Days pass, and you haven\u2019t heard a single thing from Tony. You weren\u2019t angry anymore \u2026 sadness replaced your fury. </p><p>Work kept you busy, restraining you from thinking dangerously; <i>how could you be so foolish? He\u2019d never love you. You\u2019re just his best friend. </i></p><p>You were greeted by your dog when you got home, and you were too tired and lazy to fix dinner so you ordered pizza for delivery. </p><p>Feeling a little generous, you tipped the delivery man extra when he arrived. Your blankets welcomes you as you clutched the pizza box and started the last season of Friends. </p><p>Two slices in, your phone buzzed three times. A friend from work had asked for your number today, so you pick it up, assuming it was them. What you found instead were 3 new messages from Tony. </p><p><i>I want this.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I want us.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I want you.</i></p><p>3 simple texts that set your soul on fire. 3 simple texts you never expected to receive. </p><p>Wrapping up the rest of the pizza, you make it back to the compound in less than 5 minutes; running 2 red lights isn\u2019t that bad, right? </p><p>The elevator seems to move extremely slow as it floats up to Tony\u2019s floor. It\u2019s silent except for the nervous tapping of your foot. </p><p>The ding of the elevator snaps you back, and you practically pry open the doors. You run into Tony less than a second after you step off the elevator. He was waiting for you. </p><p>Tony waists no time, grabbing your waist and walking you back into the wall. </p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d he growls lowly, nibbling your ear and lightly sucking on your neck. </p><p>You let out a gasp, your skin aching for more of Tony\u2019s touch. Your heart was already beating out of its chest. </p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help the flow of traff-\u201d your words were cut off by Tony\u2019s lips roughly meeting yours, his teeth tugging at your bottom lip.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shut up.\u201d </i>He commands.

What do ya say?&rdquo; Tony inquired, turning his head to look at you.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Grasping the strap of your book bag, you watch the road as you walk, Tony&rsquo;s proposition running through your thoughts. </i>Being married to Tony wouldn&rsquo;t be the <i>worst </i>thing in the world, <i>you thought to yourself.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, considering how you are with girls, Tony, I highly doubt you&rsquo;ll be single by then. So sure, I&rsquo;ll accept your proposition.&rdquo; You smile at him, completely sure of the fact that you would never actually have to go through with this &hellip; deal.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Tony stops you right outside your bus, slapping a hand on your shoulder and kissing your cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;Perfect! I&rsquo;ll call you tomorrow - see if we can hang out.&rdquo; He gives you a sly wink and walks off, leaving you to a silent bus ride home, only thinking of him.&nbsp;</i></p><p>__________</p><p>You leap off your couch and change into loose yoga pants and a t-shirt, fixing your makeup. It was time to find out if Tony remembered the pact or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Shooting him a quick text, you let him know you&rsquo;re coming for a visit and run down to your car.&nbsp;</p><p>A few short moments later, you arrive at the extravagant Avengers compound, the building lit up in all its glory before you. It was unbelievable how successful Tony was; which almost made this deal even more appealing. Fancy dresses, dinner parties, and press interviews seemed like a glamorous life, especially if you spent it right next to your charming, lifelong best friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking in, your eyes sweep across the entirety of the first floor, nearly jumping out of your skin when a helicarrier takes off right next to the building. You feel your eyes grow wide with curiosity as you make your way to the small group of people chatting in the lobby area. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to see Mr. Stark, please,&rdquo; you smile, the only lady there turning to look at you. She was beautiful; creamy complexion with dark red hair and green eyes that pierce your soul. You were taken aback by her beauty. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, you must be the birthday girl,&rdquo; the woman says with a soft smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m N-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Natasha Romanoff &hellip; part of the Avengers. You&rsquo;re even more beautiful in person. I-I&rsquo;ve seen what you can do, you&rsquo;re amazing.&rdquo; You gush, causing Natasha&rsquo;s cheeks to grow a paler shade of red. </p><p>&ldquo;Well thank you, y/n, maybe I could teach you a few things sometime. Tony&rsquo;s on his floor, go to the elevator and press the 4.&rdquo; She instructs, giving you a slightly bigger smile than before. You could tell this was the beginning of a new friendship, and you couldn&rsquo;t wait for what came next. </p><p>The elegant elevator ride up to Tony&rsquo;s floor is surprisingly silent - no music, which you were glad about. It let you have some time to think about what you were going to say when you reached his room. </p><p>As the doors opened, you were wowed by Tony&rsquo;s floor. Black glass floor tiles, with dark grey and white accent tones along each wall. Elegant as well, just as you expected &hellip; but in a way, even better. You couldn&rsquo;t help the huge smile plastered across your face. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony?! Where are you?&rdquo; you call out, sweeping the room for your best friend. </p><p>Just then, Tony turns the corner, wearing a suit per usual, a smile spread from ear to ear. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! There she is! Wow I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo; he says, giving you a peck on the cheek, &ldquo;You look incredible even in sweatpants - how do you pull it off?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s chuckle makes you emit a small giggle as he takes your hand gently and kisses the back of your palm. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a good mood tonight, Tony, it&rsquo;s actually kind of crazy!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony leads you to the outdoor area of the building, a small table set up with champagne, a few deep red roses, and two plates with extravagant cake placed neatly on top of each one. </p><p>&ldquo;Woah&hellip;&rdquo; you whisper. No one had ever done something like this for you before, but deep down you didn&rsquo;t expect any less from Tony. </p><p>You feel Tony&rsquo;s eyes on you and turn to him, meeting his eyes. The deep brown eyes you&rsquo;re staring into are clouded with something that could only be adoration, you figure, as he looks at you like you&rsquo;re the cutest thing he&rsquo;s ever seen. </p><p>&ldquo;Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Tony asks, his voice having a softer edge to it now. His eyes still haven&rsquo;t left your figure as he pulls your chair out for you to sit. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my - thank you,&rdquo; you blush, taking a seat and smiling when he pushes you in gently. </p><p>Tony hums a simple &lsquo;mhmmm&rsquo; and walks to his side of the table, placing himself in the chair across from you. At this time of night, all the stars are out and the sky is clear. You couldn&rsquo;t help but be impressed with everything here. </p><p>&ldquo;So I wanted to try something new - make us feel like we&rsquo;re still young and wild, y&rsquo;know? The cake flavor is chocolate but with raspberry icing - figured it&rsquo;d be a nice twist.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice pulls you from your stargazing, and your ears practically perk up when he says &lsquo;chocolate&rsquo; and &lsquo;raspberry&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;Two of my favorite flavors!&rdquo; you exclaim, unsure as to why you&rsquo;re shocked &hellip; it&rsquo;s Tony, he remembers almost <i>everything</i> anyone tells him. </p><p>Tony lets out a chuckle as he takes a bite, closing his eyes and practically moaning in response. </p><p>&ldquo;Damn, Louisa did a good job with this one.&rdquo; Tony had a maid or cook for almost every occasion, which was a bit much for you but you figured it wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to adjust to. </p><p>After almost all the cake was gone, you lean back in your chair, crossing one leg over the other. Your eyes avoid Tony&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony do you remember uhh &hellip; wow this sounds so stup-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What is it, y/n? Hesitation - I don&rsquo;t like it - makes my anxiety fuckin&rsquo; skyrocket.&rdquo; he laughs half-heartedly, trying to play off his concern. </p><p>With a sigh, you move your eyes to meet Tony&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Do you remember the deal we made? When we were 13?&rdquo; </p><p>After a moment, Tony shakes his head. &ldquo;Drawing&rsquo; a blank here, y/l/n, what &lsquo;deal&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p><p>You felt the hinges crack loose on the structure of your heart, it seeming to dangle dangerously on thin rope now. </p><p>&ldquo;Uhm &hellip;&rdquo; you clear your throat, &ldquo;the day you walked me to the bus you said if we were still single at 35, we should get married. To be bluntly honest, I was excited; I thought that&rsquo;s why you texted me happy birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyebrows raise and he looks at you with a cheeky smile. He&rsquo;s not taking this seriously and you&rsquo;re beginning to panic. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, that whole deal was a joke.&rdquo; Tony laughs under his breath, &ldquo;did you really think we&rsquo;d go through with it? Did either of us truly believe I&rsquo;d be single by now?&rdquo; </p><p>With a quick nod of embarrassment you stand and start gathering your things. This had quickly turned into <i>the</i> worst birthday ever. </p><p>&ldquo;Right &hellip; sorry for barging in and assuming things. It won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Your voice is seeping with anger and hurt, a feeling Tony knew all too well but never expected from you. </p><p>He stands to keep you from leaving, a stunned expression crossing his face. </p><p>&ldquo;So, what, y/n, are you - do you <i>love</i> me or something?!&rdquo; his question is laced with nervous energy, his voice shaking a bit. </p><p>Tears pool in your eyes, threatening to spill over as Tony says &lsquo;love&rsquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you whisper, your voice growing louder as your emotions build, &ldquo;Yes, I love you. I asked myself that question multiple times even as a teenager. You just - it was like I couldn&rsquo;t get enough of you, Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony is staring at you in complete disbelief. None of his previous flinds have ever ended in &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;, and this wasn&rsquo;t even a fling &hellip; you were his best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n &hellip; I-I have no idea what you want me to say. I don&rsquo;t - my job and my lifestyle is <i>dangerous</i> now. I can&rsquo;t have you so close to all of this. Besides, you&rsquo;re my best friend. I mean - yeah sure, I&rsquo;ve thought about a relationship with you before, but honestly, y/n, you deserve better.&rdquo; </p><p>A bitter laugh escapes your body and tears stream down your face. The rope holding your heart up safely was just cut, and you&rsquo;re drowning, clawing like a cat for any bit of hope you can find. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;<i>better</i>&rsquo;, Tony, I want <i>you</i>. I&rsquo;ve known you almost my whole life - hell, I probably know you better than you know <i>yourself</i>. You&rsquo;re just making excuses and pushing me away because you&rsquo;re scared of a God damn commitment, even though you <i>know</i> I&rsquo;ll never leave. I don&rsquo;t care how &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; it is.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony opens his mouth to speak, but you cut him off before he has the change. </p><p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t wanna hear another lame excuse. Sorry to waste your time. And thanks for the cake,&rdquo; you spit out, turning and making your way back to the car. </p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday,&rdquo; Tony mumbles as he watches you lay your head on the steering wheel. Just as he makes the decision to run after you, your car roars to life and his shoulders drop as you speed away. He wondered if you were gone for good. </p><p>__________</p><p>Days pass, and you haven&rsquo;t heard a single thing from Tony. You weren&rsquo;t angry anymore &hellip; sadness replaced your fury. </p><p>Work kept you busy, restraining you from thinking dangerously; <i>how could you be so foolish? He&rsquo;d never love you. You&rsquo;re just his best friend. </i></p><p>You were greeted by your dog when you got home, and you were too tired and lazy to fix dinner so you ordered pizza for delivery. </p><p>Feeling a little generous, you tipped the delivery man extra when he arrived. Your blankets welcomes you as you clutched the pizza box and started the last season of Friends. </p><p>Two slices in, your phone buzzed three times. A friend from work had asked for your number today, so you pick it up, assuming it was them. What you found instead were 3 new messages from Tony. </p><p><i>I want this.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I want us.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I want you.</i></p><p>3 simple texts that set your soul on fire. 3 simple texts you never expected to receive. </p><p>Wrapping up the rest of the pizza, you make it back to the compound in less than 5 minutes; running 2 red lights isn&rsquo;t that bad, right? </p><p>The elevator seems to move extremely slow as it floats up to Tony&rsquo;s floor. It&rsquo;s silent except for the nervous tapping of your foot. </p><p>The ding of the elevator snaps you back, and you practically pry open the doors. You run into Tony less than a second after you step off the elevator. He was waiting for you. </p><p>Tony waists no time, grabbing your waist and walking you back into the wall. </p><p>&ldquo;Took you long enough,&rdquo; he growls lowly, nibbling your ear and lightly sucking on your neck. </p><p>You let out a gasp, your skin aching for more of Tony&rsquo;s touch. Your heart was already beating out of its chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t help the flow of traff-&rdquo; your words were cut off by Tony&rsquo;s lips roughly meeting yours, his teeth tugging at your bottom lip.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shut up.&rdquo; </i>He commands. A moan rises from you, only fueling tony even more. His hands traveled under your shirt, wandering all over your body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Each time Tony touched you, it felt like tiny zaps of electricity tingling through your body. The two of you couldn&rsquo;t get enough of each other, and you eventually wound up in Tony&rsquo;s silk sheets, completely naked before him. </p><p>&ldquo;My <i>God</i> you&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; Tony said, four little words that rang through your head as the night full of pleasures continued. </p><p>__________</p><p>Hours later, once you&rsquo;ve managed to calm yourself and relax once again, Tony pulls you on top of him, your body pressed tightly against his. </p><p>Your fingers trace random patterns on his chest as his do the same to your back. </p><p>&ldquo;You are &hellip; <i>truly</i> remarkable - there are no words to describe you.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice is soft and soothing, yet full of adoration. </p><p>Unable to help yourself, you giggle and plant a kiss on his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;That was undoubtedly the best night of my life.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony is unable to contain his joy, a smile spreading ear to ear across his face. His hand snakes under your chin, tilting your face up to look at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Marry me,&rdquo; he whispers, kissing you softly. </p><p>You pull away, radiating pure joy as you rub your thumb across his cheekbone. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never ask.&rdquo;</p>",

It passes, as all things do, like clouds over the sun.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>And yet we hurt, and hunger, and grieve. For what is humanity, but pain? Fate is not known to be kind.So, naturally, she had to go and make you feel the pain of your Soulmate as well.</p><p>Stephen is only four when the first strike falls.</p><p>How odd, he thinks, to have his pudgy fingertips fizzle and pop and sting, how utterly strange that he should burn, rather than be held close in loving arms and sung to sleep.</p><p>Stephen is only four when the first strike falls, and it&rsquo;s&hellip;worse. So much worse. Worse than the phantom pinch of sparks, worse than the poke of an unaccounted for screwdriver in the dark. He is only four, when his head snaps to the side with a crack, and he begins to wail, breakfast forgotten.</p><p>Thinking back on it, when he still thought about it, when he still cared; he wondered in horror how anyone could ever do such a thing to one so young. Stephen had only been four when the first strike fell, his soulmate just as young, if not younger. He brings his hand to his cheek, lips parting in a pantomime of a scream.</p><p>He&rsquo;d stared hard at the initials inked in neat black capitals on his wrist from the moment he understood what they meant. Tall and proud, if not a bit rushed, they stared right back, stark against his pale skin.</p><p><b>A.E.S.</b></p>",
