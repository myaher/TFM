Al principio tan solo fueron un par de individuos, ocultos tras una m\u00e1scara y un alias con el que protegerse de las amenazas a las que se enfrentaban. Luego vinieron m\u00e1s, todo tipo de h\u00e9roes dispuestos incluso a sacrificarse por el bien mayor. Algunos nacieron en nuestro planeta, otros llegaron de muy lejos, pero a todos ellos los un\u00eda un mismo objetivo: proteger a la humanidad ante cualquier clase de peligro. Desde su aparici\u00f3n en la sociedad, sus haza\u00f1as ocuparon el foco central de los telediarios y sus trajes se convirtieron en los disfraces favoritos de los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os (y no tan peque\u00f1os). Sus rostros eran una cara amiga en el momento m\u00e1s desesperado. Sus nombres, la promesa de una nueva esperanza.\n\nPero algo ha cambiado.",
