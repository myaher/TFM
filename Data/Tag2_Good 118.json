        "body": "<p>A couple years ago in my senior year of high school, my English teacher had told us for our last essay of the year, to pick any novel by any notable author, and write about it. I picked Good Omens cause i happened to be reading it at the time, but this essay was legit the most fun I\u2019ve ever had writing an essay. I figured with the show coming out at <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMs17wWDkgpADeKyfJ6dKpg\">@neil-gaiman</a> being on tumblr, I might as well post it here were people might enjoy it. </p><p>Its about why Good Omens is successful as a comedy. It\u2019s kinda long so it\u2019s gonna go beneath a cut. But yeah here it is. (Also apologies for the formatting I cant figure out how to make this thing readable. rn it looks a lot better on desktop than mobile. Any suggestions on that are welcome)</p><!-- more --><hr><p><b>&mdash;</b></p><p>In the world of entertainment&ndash; be that film, TV, literature, etc. &ndash; comedy is hard. It\u2019s hard to act, it\u2019s hard to write, and it takes real talent to do comedy well. Often, comedy goes underappreciated in the professional world; however, <i>Good Omens</i> seems to be an exception. In writing the forward to their book, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman describe the many well-read and deteriorating copies of <i>Good Omens</i> that they have had the pleasure of signing. From books dropped in bathtubs and puddles, to pages being held together by packing tape, clearly, the book is well loved by many. The unique quality of this novel is that rather than a \u201claugh-out-loud\u201d humor, Pratchett and Gaiman aimed for a more subtle, ironic humor adding up to a satire that teaches a lesson on the importance of humanity and compassion. All in all, <i>Good Omens</i> is a delightfully witty and entertaining book that is sure to please any avid reader.</p><p><b>&mdash;</b></p><p><b>Biography</b></p><p>It was the year 1989 when Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett decided to combine efforts in writing <i>Good Omens</i>. At the time, Gaiman was 29. He was born in Hampshire UK in 1960 and grew up frequently visiting his local library, developing a life-long love for reading. After briefly pursuing a career in journalism, he soon became interested in writing comic books. <i>The Sandman</i> is one of Gaiman\u2019s most notable graphic novel works. It won several awards including three Harvey Awards, nine Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, and the 1991 World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story, becoming the first comic to every receive a literary award. \u00a0After gaining this success, Gaiman has gone on to expand his resume by working in film and television. He\u2019s written and directed two films: <i>A Short Film About John Bolton</i> (2002) and <i>Statueque</i> (2009). Most recently, Gaiman is writing for the television series adaption of his book, <i>American Gods, </i>set to premier on April 30, 2017 on Starz.</p><p>Gaiman\u2019s writing companion, Terry Pratchett, was born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire in 1948. He had a passion for writing from a young age, publishing his first story, \u201cThe Hades Business\u201d in his school magazine at age thirteen. Four years later at age seventeen, Pratchett dropped out of school to pursue journalism. It was in this line of work that he came into contact with his first publisher, Colin Smythe, and through him published his first book in 1971, <i>The Carpet People</i>. Smythe remained a close friend of Pratchett and in 1983 published the first book of Pratchett\u2019s phenomenally successful series: <i>Discworld</i>. At this time, Pratchett worked for the Central Electricity Generating Board as a press officer. Four books into his Discworld series, Pratchett decided to become a full time writer. After a long and successful career, unfortunately in 2007 Pratchett was diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer\u2019s called Posterior Cortical Atrophy. He lived the last years of his life very well; in 2009, he was knighted by the Queen for his services to literature and in 2013 he presented a documentary discussing the controversial topic of assisted dying. <i>Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die </i>won both an Emmy and a BAFTA. Despite campaigning for assisted dying, Terry did not choose to take his own life and died peacefully surrounded by family in March 2015.<br/></p><p><b>&mdash;-</b></p><p><b>Extended Analysis</b></p><p>The comedy collaboration <i>Good Omens</i> has been deemed by many to be a great novel. Critics praise the unique blend of writing styles for making this novel a success, but to understand what makes the comedic genius of <i>Good Omens</i>, one must ask what precisely makes it funny. This novel is a satire; it comments on existentialist ideas surrounding humanity and the responsibility humans have over their own actions for better or for worse. In order to emphasize their novel as an unexpectedly witty and socially relevant satire, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett use several literary devices such as repetition, mood, and irony. In a remarkable world belonging to angels and demons who wish to bring about the apocalypse, the air of abnormality must be maintained throughout the novel; comedy only follows naturally.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>In order to emphasize the absurdity of the events in <i>Good Omens</i>, the authors often used repetition in describing people or events. Given that this book revolves around the events of Armageddon, absurdity is not hard to come by; it is precisely what enforces the satire nature of the novel. For instance, the Antichrist is first described to the reader as \u201ca golden haired male baby we will call the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of this World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness\u201d (Gaiman 27). Not only does the baby have this long list of titles, but he is referred to as such several more times in the next few pages. This description is a means to bring attention to the oddness of the situation and the repetition serves to emphasize it. Another interesting use of repetition is a scene in which the events of the evening are being narrated by an irritable man named R. P. Tyler; a man who not only believes himself to be the sole decider of right and wrong in the world, but that it is his responsibility to pronounce his wisdom unto others via the letter column of the Tadfield <i>Adviser</i>. This man is the epitome of arrogant old men and on the afternoon of Armageddon, finds himself directing several parties of odd people to the same location. In the eyes of the reader, all of the characters introduced thus far are arriving to the small English town of Tadfield for the start of the apocalypse. The events are rumored to take place at the Lower Tadfield Air Base and in succession, R. P. Tyler encounters four groups of people going to the Airfield within a span of 30 minutes (Gaiman 325-336). The result is a comedic effect that brings all separate storylines back to the same page. The repetition of events is what brought to R. P. Tyler\u2019s attention to the odd occurrences in Tadfield. As the man met group after group, he quickly becomes more flustered and his figurative bubble of normality is cracking until Crowley\u2019s arrival: \u201cThere was a large once-black car on fire in the lane and a man in sunglasses was leaning out the window, saying through the smoke \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve managed to get a little lost. Can you direct me to the Lower Tadfield Air Base? I know it\u2019s around here somewhere\u201d\u201d (Gaiman 334). One can safely say that after this event, R. P. Tyler no longer has a figurative bubble of normality.</p><p><b>&mdash;</b></p><p>One of the highlights of <i>Good Omens</i> is the comical language in which it is written, setting an air for the absurd to be normalized and the mundane to receive an exaggerated retelling. An ambiance of abnormality is maintained throughout the entire novel through methods of over-explaining minute details. For instance, as the first proceedings of Armageddon are set into motion, the scene is set with the following depiction:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dark and stormy night. It should have been, but that\u2019s the weather for you. For every mad scientist who\u2019s had a convenient thunderstorm just on the night his Great Work is finished and lying on the slab, there have been dozens who\u2019s sat around aimlessly under the peaceful stars while Igor clocks up the overtime\u201d (Gaiman 14).</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>This description of the setting contributes to a lighthearted mood despite the impending apocalypse. It feels as though the authors are making polite conversation as the story progresses, and this style of writing is used throughout the novel. Later on, a scene occurs in which a demon kills a room full of telemarketers and the aftermath is described as follows: \u201c&hellip; a wave of low-grade goodness started to spread exponentially through the population and millions of people who ultimately would not have suffered minor bruises of the soul did not in fact do so\u201d (Gaiman 308). The elegance in which that sentence is written gives the reader a sense of understanding in that the authors are not technically wrong in their description. The line is satirical and for many readers, felt on a personal level. The witty line does not fail in upholding the absurd and exceedingly nonchalant atmosphere. This style brings to light underlying truths of humanity that one may not acknowledge in a day to day basis, but are true nonetheless. Through this recognition of distinctly human emotions and struggles, Gaiman and Pratchett succeed in creating an engaging environment in which the reader is both reflective and entertained by their story.</p><p><b>&mdash;</b></p><p>The irony in <i>Good Omens</i> lies within the ongoing discussion of humanity and the importance of free will. As Heaven and Hell prepare for Armageddon, the key to its commencement lies in the hands of the Antichrist. However, the Antichrist ends up being much more human than either side predicted. As usual, the demon Crowley and angel Aziraphale come to this conclusion long before their superiors:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201c\u201cBecause if I know anything,\u201d said Crowley urgently, \u201cit\u2019s that the birth is just the start. It\u2019s the upbringing that\u2019s important. It\u2019s the influences. Otherwise it will never learn to use its powers.\u201d &hellip;</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the child isn\u2019t evil of itself?\u201d [Aziraphale] said slowly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Potentially</i> evil. \u00a0Potentially good, too, I suppose. Just this huge powerful <i>potentiality</i>, waiting to be shaped.\u201d said Crowley\u201d (Gaiman 58).\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Given that Adam the Antichrist grew up in the absence of any supernatural influence, he naturally became a very pure and innocent child who only wanted save the environment and read conspiracy theory magazines. In fact, unaware of his power and heritage, he was involuntarily at fault for the rise of Atlantis and the visitations of aliens. His deep love for the planet also allowed for his subconscious to grow rain forests in the thick of cities and to turn 500 tons of Uranium into a lemon drop. In a book that satirizes the meanings of good and evil, it is very ironic that the Antichrist has the greatest amount of love to give. As observed by local witch, Anathema: \u201cSomething or someone loves this place. Loves every inch of it so powerfully that it shields and protects it. A deep-down, huge, fierce love. How can anything bad start here?\u201d (Gaiman 229). It is reiterated several times throughout the book that humans are their own worst enemy. They are the ones who have free will, therefore they choose whether to act good or evil. Demons and angels have no choice in this respect. Gaiman and Pratchett make clear to their audience that humans must value their free will, spread love and live life to its fullest. If the Antichrist can do it, so can you.</p><p><b>&mdash;</b></p><p>When reflecting on the comedic success of <i>Good Omens</i>, one can conclude that Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are masters at their craft. This wonderfully composed work of fiction succeeds in satirizing the inner workings of human nature in that the supernatural can do no worse to humans than humans already do to themselves. Stylistically, Gaiman and Pratchett create a casual environment that highlights the absurd events by using techniques such as irony, mood, and repetition. The result is a clever and profound lesson on the importance of love in the human experience taught not by those who are human, but those who act with the most humanity.</p>",

It\u2019s hard to act, it\u2019s hard to write, and it takes real talent to do comedy well. Often, comedy goes underappreciated in the professional world; however, <i>Good Omens</i> seems to be an exception. In writing the forward to their book, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman describe the many well-read and deteriorating copies of <i>Good Omens</i> that they have had the pleasure of signing. From books dropped in bathtubs and puddles, to pages being held together by packing tape, clearly, the book is well loved by many. The unique quality of this novel is that rather than a \u201claugh-out-loud\u201d humor, Pratchett and Gaiman aimed for a more subtle, ironic humor adding up to a satire that teaches a lesson on the importance of humanity and compassion. All in all, <i>Good Omens</i> is a delightfully witty and entertaining book that is sure to please any avid reader.</p><p><b>\u2014</b></p><p><b>Biography</b></p><p>It was the year 1989 when Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett decided to combine efforts in writing <i>Good Omens</i>. At the time, Gaiman was 29. He was born in Hampshire UK in 1960 and grew up frequently visiting his local library, developing a life-long love for reading. After briefly pursuing a career in journalism, he soon became interested in writing comic books. <i>The Sandman</i> is one of Gaiman\u2019s most notable graphic novel works. It won several awards including three Harvey Awards, nine Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, and the 1991 World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story, becoming the first comic to every receive a literary award. \u00a0After gaining this success, Gaiman has gone on to expand his resume by working in film and television. He\u2019s written and directed two films: <i>A Short Film About John Bolton</i> (2002) and <i>Statueque</i> (2009). Most recently, Gaiman is writing for the television series adaption of his book, <i>American Gods, </i>set to premier on April 30, 2017 on Starz.</p><p>Gaiman\u2019s writing companion, Terry Pratchett, was born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire in 1948. He had a passion for writing from a young age, publishing his first story, \u201cThe Hades Business\u201d in his school magazine at age thirteen. Four years later at age seventeen, Pratchett dropped out of school to pursue journalism. It was in this line of work that he came into contact with his first publisher, Colin Smythe, and through him published his first book in 1971, <i>The Carpet People</i>. Smythe remained a close friend of Pratchett and in 1983 published the first book of Pratchett\u2019s phenomenally successful series: <i>Discworld</i>. At this time, Pratchett worked for the Central Electricity Generating Board as a press officer. Four books into his Discworld series, Pratchett decided to become a full time writer. After a long and successful career, unfortunately in 2007 Pratchett was diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer\u2019s called Posterior Cortical Atrophy. He lived the last years of his life very well; in 2009, he was knighted by the Queen for his services to literature and in 2013 he presented a documentary discussing the controversial topic of assisted dying. <i>Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die </i>won both an Emmy and a BAFTA. Despite campaigning for assisted dying, Terry did not choose to take his own life and died peacefully surrounded by family in March 2015.<br></p><p><b>\u2014-</b></p><p><b>Extended Analysis</b></p><p>The comedy collaboration <i>Good Omens</i> has been deemed by many to be a great novel. Critics praise the unique blend of writing styles for making this novel a success, but to understand what makes the comedic genius of <i>Good Omens</i>, one must ask what precisely makes it funny. This novel is a satire; it comments on existentialist ideas surrounding humanity and the responsibility humans have over their own actions for better or for worse. In order to emphasize their novel as an unexpectedly witty and socially relevant satire, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett use several literary devices such as repetition, mood, and irony. In a remarkable world belonging to angels and demons who wish to bring about the apocalypse, the air of abnormality must be maintained throughout the novel; comedy only follows naturally.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>In order to emphasize the absurdity of the events in <i>Good Omens</i>, the authors often used repetition in describing people or events. Given that this book revolves around the events of Armageddon, absurdity is not hard to come by; it is precisely what enforces the satire nature of the novel. For instance, the Antichrist is first described to the reader as \u201ca golden haired male baby we will call the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of this World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness\u201d (Gaiman 27). Not only does the baby have this long list of titles, but he is referred to as such several more times in the next few pages. This description is a means to bring attention to the oddness of the situation and the repetition serves to emphasize it. Another interesting use of repetition is a scene in which the events of the evening are being narrated by an irritable man named R. P. Tyler; a man who not only believes himself to be the sole decider of right and wrong in the world, but that it is his responsibility to pronounce his wisdom unto others via the letter column of the Tadfield <i>Adviser</i>. This man is the epitome of arrogant old men and on the afternoon of Armageddon, finds himself directing several parties of odd people to the same location. In the eyes of the reader, all of the characters introduced thus far are arriving to the small English town of Tadfield for the start of the apocalypse. The events are rumored to take place at the Lower Tadfield Air Base and in succession, R. P. Tyler encounters four groups of people going to the Airfield within a span of 30 minutes (Gaiman 325-336). The result is a comedic effect that brings all separate storylines back to the same page. The repetition of events is what brought to R. P. Tyler\u2019s attention to the odd occurrences in Tadfield. As the man met group after group, he quickly becomes more flustered and his figurative bubble of normality is cracking until Crowley\u2019s arrival: \u201cThere was a large once-black car on fire in the lane and a man in sunglasses was leaning out the window, saying through the smoke \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve managed to get a little lost. Can you direct me to the Lower Tadfield Air Base? I know it\u2019s around here somewhere\u201d\u201d (Gaiman 334). One can safely say that after this event, R. P. Tyler no longer has a figurative bubble of normality.</p><p><b>\u2014</b></p><p>One of the highlights of <i>Good Omens</i> is the comical language in which it is written, setting an air for the absurd to be normalized and the mundane to receive an exaggerated retelling. An ambiance of abnormality is maintained throughout the entire novel through methods of over-explaining minute details. For instance, as the first proceedings of Armageddon are set into motion, the scene is set with the following depiction:</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dark and stormy night. It should have been, but that\u2019s the weather for you. For every mad scientist who\u2019s had a convenient thunderstorm just on the night his Great Work is finished and lying on the slab, there have been dozens who\u2019s sat around aimlessly under the peaceful stars while Igor clocks up the overtime\u201d (Gaiman 14).</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>This description of the setting contributes to a lighthearted mood despite the impending apocalypse. It feels as though the authors are making polite conversation as the story progresses, and this style of writing is used throughout the novel. Later on, a scene occurs in which a demon kills a room full of telemarketers and the aftermath is described as follows: \u201c\u2026 a wave of low-grade goodness started to spread exponentially through the population and millions of people who ultimately would not have suffered minor bruises of the soul did not in fact do so\u201d (Gaiman 308). The elegance in which that sentence is written gives the reader a sense of understanding in that the authors are not technically wrong in their description. The line is satirical and for many readers, felt on a personal level. The witty line does not fail in upholding the absurd and exceedingly nonchalant atmosphere. This style brings to light underlying truths of humanity that one may not acknowledge in a day to day basis, but are true nonetheless. Through this recognition of distinctly human emotions and struggles, Gaiman and Pratchett succeed in creating an engaging environment in which the reader is both reflective and entertained by their story.</p><p><b>\u2014</b></p><p>The irony in <i>Good Omens</i> lies within the ongoing discussion of humanity and the importance of free will. As Heaven and Hell prepare for Armageddon, the key to its commencement lies in the hands of the Antichrist. However, the Antichrist ends up being much more human than either side predicted. As usual, the demon Crowley and angel Aziraphale come to this conclusion long before their superiors:</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\u201c\u201cBecause if I know anything,\u201d said Crowley urgently, \u201cit\u2019s that the birth is just the start. It\u2019s the upbringing that\u2019s important. It\u2019s the influences. Otherwise it will never learn to use its powers.\u201d \u2026</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the child isn\u2019t evil of itself?\u201d [Aziraphale] said slowly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Potentially</i> evil. \u00a0Potentially good, too, I suppose. Just this huge powerful <i>potentiality</i>, waiting to be shaped.\u201d said Crowley\u201d (Gaiman 58).\u00a0\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Given that Adam the Antichrist grew up in the absence of any supernatural influence, he naturally became a very pure and innocent child who only wanted save the environment and read conspiracy theory magazines. In fact, unaware of his power and heritage, he was involuntarily at fault for the rise of Atlantis and the visitations of aliens. His deep love for the planet also allowed for his subconscious to grow rain forests in the thick of cities and to turn 500 tons of Uranium into a lemon drop. In a book that satirizes the meanings of good and evil, it is very ironic that the Antichrist has the greatest amount of love to give. As observed by local witch, Anathema: \u201cSomething or someone loves this place. Loves every inch of it so powerfully that it shields and protects it. A deep-down, huge, fierce love. How can anything bad start here?\u201d (Gaiman 229). It is reiterated several times throughout the book that humans are their own worst enemy. They are the ones who have free will, therefore they choose whether to act good or evil. Demons and angels have no choice in this respect. Gaiman and Pratchett make clear to their audience that humans must value their free will, spread love and live life to its fullest. If the Antichrist can do it, so can you.</p><p><b>\u2014</b></p><p>When reflecting on the comedic success of <i>Good Omens</i>, one can conclude that Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are masters at their craft.

(Also apologies for the formatting I cant figure out how to make this thing readable. rn it looks a lot better on desktop than mobile. Any suggestions on that are welcome)</p>\n</p>",
