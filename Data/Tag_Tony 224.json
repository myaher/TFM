He sighed and took his sister.</p><p>\u201cPepper\u2019s not dying,\u201d Peter\nsaid, before marching off to the bathroom.</p><p>-</p><p>Pepper might as well have\nbeen dying, because as far as Mrs Stark was concerned, being ill <i>at all</i> was the sign of the plague. In\nthe whole time Tony had known her, she\u2019d been sick once; back when he was first\nparading around in a flashy red and gold suit, thinking himself the hottest of\nshit. She\u2019d had a cold, and her nose all red was cute, whether Tony wanted to\nadmit it or not.</p><p>Pepper hadn\u2019t been ill since,\nbecause Pepper Stark does not <i>get </i>sick.\nPepper Stark is stronger than the common cold or the flu. She is stronger than\nthe food poisoning that Tony and Peter had come down with after some bad chicken,\nthat she had eaten too but had <i>decided</i>\nshe wasn\u2019t going to get ill from.</p><p>So if Pepper Stark was\nbedridden, she was on her way to death\u2019s doors, and even then she was still\nworking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be\nresting,\u201d Tony said, wandering into their bedroom as Peter tried to teach a\nthree-month old the alphabet. Both boys were pretty sure that Morgan was going\nto outshine them all, but Pepper was pretty sure she was a <i>three-month old</i> and wouldn\u2019t get a grasp of the alphabet for a\nlittle while longer yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rest when I\u2019m dead,\u201d\nPepper replied, absent, scrolling through a StarkPad that Tony had foolishly\nleft in her vicinity. Her skin was paler than usual, and she\u2019d spent the entire\nnight vomiting out her insides \u2013 which she hadn\u2019t even done when pregnant with\nMorgan, no. She\u2019d felt the pain in her stomach, announced, <i>this foetus isn\u2019t going to make me throw up</i>, and so it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAs hardcore as that sounds,\nyou need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shareholders\u2019\nmeeting, a board members\u2019 meeting <i>and</i>\nI had a phone call scheduled with Pym Tech this afternoon. I <i>need</i> to be at work.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes,\nsettling on the edge of the bed. He placed his fingers on top of the StarkPad\nand pushed it down so she\u2019d finally look at him. \u201cAnd you call me a\nworkaholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d Pepper\nreplied. There were bags on the bags under her eyes, and Tony sent her a\nsympathetic smile, before brushing her fringe from her forehead. Her skin was\nhot to the touch, and Pepper\u2019s eyes drifted shut at the feel of his hand\npressed there.</p><p>\u201cYou always say I work so\nhard I forget about my health,\u201d Tony said, quiet, though there was a hint of <i>I\u2019m right and you know it</i> in his tone.\n\u201cThat I\u2019m \u2013 what was it? Obsessed and losing sleep over it?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sighed through her\nnose. \u201cI\u2019m not losing sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep at all last\nnight. You were too busy vomiting your guts up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence\nwhere Tony moved his hand from her forehead, tucking a lose lock of hair behind\nher ear.</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThat\u2019s\nall this is. One day where you can rest and care about your health and let\nsomeone else run the business into the ground.\u201d She pulled a face and he\nlaughed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t look after yourself right now, you\u2019ll never have a high\nhorse to sit on again when it comes to me and how long I spend in the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair and you know\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Tony pressed a kiss against\nher forehead before slipping the StarkPad from her grasp. He refilled her glass\nof water from the tap in the en suite as Pepper slipped back down into bed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Morgan?\u201d Pepper asked,\nher body betraying her with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just fine. I\u2019m a good\ndad you know. I can look after her for a day without your supervision.\u201d</p><p>Pepper laughed, pressing her\ncheek into the pillow. \u201cI know. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just like calling you\nperiodically throughout the day anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips curled into a\nsmile. \u201cMrs Stark, do you use our daughter as an excuse to talk to me when you\nshould be working?\u201d</p><p>Pepper yawned with a tired\nsmile. \u201cMr Stark, why would I ever do such a thing as that?\u201d</p><p>Tony brushed a hand through\nher hair as Pepper\u2019s eyes flickered shut.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Pep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.

He smiled, holding\nher close, before immediately frowning. \u201cYou\u2019re a Stark,\u201d he said with a sigh.\n\u201cStark\u2019s should be potty trained by six weeks.\u201d</p><p>Next to him, Peter scoffed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t place unrealistic expectations on a new born, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Tony held out his daughter\ntowards Peter. \u201cGo change her.\u201d</p><p>Peter raised an unimpressed\neyebrow. \u201cShe\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s <i>your </i>responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Tony said, popping\nthe \u2018p\u2019. \u201cPepper said she\u2019s under both of our care while she\u2019s dying.

Her skin was paler than usual, and she\u2019d spent the entire\nnight vomiting out her insides \u2013 which she hadn\u2019t even done when pregnant with\nMorgan, no. She\u2019d felt the pain in her stomach, announced, <i>this foetus isn\u2019t going to make me throw up</i>, and so it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAs hardcore as that sounds,\nyou need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shareholders\u2019\nmeeting, a board members\u2019 meeting <i>and</i>\nI had a phone call scheduled with Pym Tech this afternoon.

He placed his fingers on top of the StarkPad\nand pushed it down so she\u2019d finally look at him. \u201cAnd you call me a\nworkaholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d Pepper\nreplied. There were bags on the bags under her eyes, and Tony sent her a\nsympathetic smile, before brushing her fringe from her forehead. Her skin was\nhot to the touch, and Pepper\u2019s eyes drifted shut at the feel of his hand\npressed there.</p><p>\u201cYou always say I work so\nhard I forget about my health,\u201d Tony said, quiet, though there was a hint of <i>I\u2019m right and you know it</i> in his tone.\n\u201cThat I\u2019m \u2013 what was it? Obsessed and losing sleep over it?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sighed through her\nnose. \u201cI\u2019m not losing sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep at all last\nnight. You were too busy vomiting your guts up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence\nwhere Tony moved his hand from her forehead, tucking a lose lock of hair behind\nher ear.</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThat\u2019s\nall this is. One day where you can rest and care about your health and let\nsomeone else run the business into the ground.\u201d She pulled a face and he\nlaughed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t look after yourself right now, you\u2019ll never have a high\nhorse to sit on again when it comes to me and how long I spend in the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair and you know\nit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Tony pressed a kiss against\nher forehead before slipping the StarkPad from her grasp. He refilled her glass\nof water from the tap in the en suite as Pepper slipped back down into bed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Morgan?\u201d Pepper asked,\nher body betraying her with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just fine. I\u2019m a good\ndad you know. I can look after her for a day without your supervision.\u201d</p><p>Pepper laughed, pressing her\ncheek into the pillow. \u201cI know. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just like calling you\nperiodically throughout the day anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips curled into a\nsmile. \u201cMrs Stark, do you use our daughter as an excuse to talk to me when you\nshould be working?\u201d</p><p>Pepper yawned with a tired\nsmile. \u201cMr Stark, why would I ever do such a thing as that?\u201d</p><p>Tony brushed a hand through\nher hair as Pepper\u2019s eyes flickered shut.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Pep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.

        "body": "<p>I\u2019ve been inspired by everyone on Tumblr so I wrote my first Irondad fic! Shoutout to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myTmHi6hNWABfFiGG84Caww\">@peterparkerisntdead</a> for giving me ideas for this and being the most valid mutual on this website. You a real one bruh.</p><p>Words: 3,100</p><p>Characters: Peter Parker, Tony Stark, Flash Thompson, May Parker (mentioned)</p><p>Warnings: Major fluffiness, a smidge of angst, a bit of bullying, lots of Irondad</p><p><i>Hope you enjoy it!</i></p><p>Peter is so totally screwed and that\u2019s just a fact at this point.</p><p>Not that he blames May, of course. There\u2019s no way she could have known she\u2019d get called into work so suddenly. It\u2019s just, well\u2026 he needs another chaperone. And where on earth is he going to find someone now, just days before the field trip?</p><p>Peter puts his phone down on his desk and runs a hand over his face. He needs something to take away his anxiety and help him clear his head a little.</p><p>Hot chocolate. He needs hot chocolate.</p><!-- more --><p>He makes his way to the kitchen, through the maze of hallways in the compound. As he waits for the milk to heat up in the microwave, Peter begins a list in his head: May is obviously out of the question; Mr. Stark would never in a million years agree to watch a bunch of snot-nosed teens for a day; Ms. Potts has a company to run and Peter wouldn\u2019t want to bother her with something like this; there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ask Vision to do it, either; and since Colonel Rhodes is still on the mend, Peter doesn\u2019t want to put any more unneeded stress on the man.</p><p>Peter is in quite the pickle.</p><p>The microwave dings. Peter pulls out the warm milk and adds the cocoa powder, stirring gently. On his way back to the other side of the island, he grabs a couple cookies from Mr. Stark\u2019s secret stash. As he sinks into his chair and takes that first chocolatey sip, he hears footsteps coming from the direction of the lab. Peter turns to see Mr. Stark enter the kitchen, coffee mug in hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d he greets, patting Peter\u2019s shoulder before taking his mug to the sink.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter returns. He takes another sip of hot chocolate and tries to think of more possibilities.</p><p>Mr. Stark pauses, looking back at the teen sitting in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you, kid? Something happen on patrol last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter admits, \u201cI\u2019m just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I smelled something burning.\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a face at his mentor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Mr. Stark asks. He leans on the counter across from him.</p><p>Sighing, Peter explains, \u201cMy Environmental Science class is going on a field trip to the zoo on Friday and May was supposed to chaperone, except now she has to cover for her coworker all week so she can\u2019t go. And that means I need to find someone to fill in for her or my teacher is gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark thinks for a moment, stroking his goatee.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that does sound like quite the predicament,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe only people I could think of were you, Ms. Potts, Vision, and Colonel Rhodes, but Ms. Potts has a company to run and Vision would just raise a bunch of questions and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait, what about me?\u201d</p><p>Peter rubs the back of his neck. \u201cWell, I figured you\u2019d have better things to do than spend the day at a zoo with a bunch of teenagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cThe zoo sounds way better than going to boring meetings and pretending to pay attention all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally. When did you say it was?\u201d he asks, already pulling out his phone.</p><p>Peter can\u2019t help the excitement blooming in his chest as he tells him, \u201cIt\u2019s this Friday. We have to be at school at the normal time\u2014which is 8 if you didn\u2019t know\u2014and then we\u2019re gonna head over to the Central Park Zoo and we get to do whatever we want\u2014within reason, obviously\u2014and we can go anywhere in the zoo as long as we\u2019re with an adult, but we do have to head to certain habitats because we\u2019re gonna have a worksheet to fill out that we have to hand in so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark raises a hand, effectively cutting Peter off from his rambles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fill in for your aunt as long as you don\u2019t talk my ear off while we\u2019re there,\u201d he proposes. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d Peter says, grinning broadly. A thought quickly comes to his mind and his smile falters just slightly. \u201cUh, Mr. Stark, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have your clearances already, would you?\u201d</p><p>\ud83d\udd78\u238a\ud83d\udd78</p><p>Friday comes quickly for Peter. Environmental Science isn\u2019t necessarily his favorite class this year, but he can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s super excited to go to the zoo, especially since Mr. Stark will be there.</p><p>That morning, he catches an earlier train to make sure he definitely won\u2019t be late. He also maybe kinda sorta wants to be there before Mr. Stark gets there.</p><p>When he gets to Midtown, there are already a few kids from his class milling in front of the entrance; the ones who notice him approach offer small smiles. By the time everyone in the class shows up, there are five minutes until they have to leave and Mr. Stark is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Peter tries not to panic too much. He might be stuck in traffic or want to be fashionably late\u2026 or he forgot entirely. Peter quickly shoves the thought from his mind. No, Mr. Stark is a lot of things but forgetful isn\u2019t usually one of them. Plus, he seemed like he was actually looking forward to this when they talked on the phone the other night.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter glances over his shoulder to see his teacher looking at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon, Mrs. Hernandez,\u201d he assures her. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>But then there are two minutes until they have to leave and still no Mr. Stark. The other kids are beginning to get annoyed with him, he can tell, because they just want to get the trip started. Peter checks his phone, in case he missed any calls from the man, when a car engine catches his attention.</p><p>He raises his head just as one of Mr. Stark\u2019s fancy cars pulls into the parking lot and parks a few spaces away from the class. Mr. Stark gets out of the car and straightens his crisp black suit before walking over to the group of students gawking at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, teach,\u201d he calls, adjusting his sunglasses. \u201cTraffic was a mess.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hernandez just nods dumbly.</p><p>When Mr. Stark reaches Peter, he clasps a hand on his shoulder. \u201cHow&rsquo;s it going, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You ready for the zoo, Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born ready,\u201d he says. \u201cI should probably go meet with the boss lady before we go, so we\u2019ll talk later, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr. Stark!\u201d says Peter.</p><p>As soon as Mr. Stark is somewhat out of earshot, the rest of the class descends on Peter, their voices blurring together.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Tony Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Parker, I didn\u2019t think you were serious about that internship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you ask him if I can get a picture?\u201d</p><p>Peter tries to answer their questions despite his quickening breaths and the growing headache behind his eyes. He\u2019s never been good at being the center of attention, but with his heightened senses, the sudden increase of noise makes him feel even worse.</p><p>Eventually, Mrs. Hernandez calls for everyone to get on the bus and Peter breathes a sigh of relief. He climbs on behind Cindy and takes a seat toward the back of the bus, some distance away from everyone else. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s trying to be antisocial or anything, he just needs some time alone to chill out and let himself calm down a little. He doesn\u2019t get very far into his \u201cme time\u201d before Mrs. Hernandez is addressing the class.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be splitting up into groups before we get to the zoo and I\u2019ll hand out the worksheets then,\u201d she tells them. \u201cEveryone must be part of a group and you must stay with a chaperone at all times.\u201d</p><p>All heads swivel toward Peter expectantly, and he slumps in his seat, trying to disappear on the spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already chosen your groups, guys,\u201d Mrs. Hernandez says quickly, earning more than a few groans up and down the bus. She starts reading names off of a list, pairing kids with one of the nine chaperones. If Peter\u2019s math is correct, and it usually is, that means there should be three kids per group, with one group of two. Mr. Stark\u2019s name is the last one read, followed by, \u201cMr. Parker and Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart sinks to the pavement racing beneath the bus. Twenty-six other kids in the class and it just has to be <i>him</i>. A few rows ahead, Flash turns around, giving Peter a wicked grin, and all of Peter\u2019s excitement for the trip disappears at once.</p><p>An hour later, the bus pulls up outside of the Central Park Zoo and everyone clambers off to stand with their groups; Flash makes sure to step on Peter\u2019s foot when Mr. Stark isn\u2019t looking. Despite the flare of pain, Peter doesn\u2019t say a word. He\u2019s been waiting for this all week, and he\u2019s not about to let Flash ruin it for him.</p><p>Once Mrs. Hernandez has passed out the worksheets and everyone has gone through security and the ticket stalls, they\u2019re free to do whatever they want.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do you want to go first, boys?\u201d Mr. Stark asks, his eyes scanning the map he\u2019d picked up at the entrance.</p><p>Peter opens his mouth to respond, but Flash doesn\u2019t give him the chance.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see the poison dart frogs!\u201d he says. It doesn\u2019t sound much like a suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYou good with that, Pete?\u201d</p><p>Even though he really wants to see the penguins, Peter shrugs and replies, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As they set off for the frogs, Flash in the lead, Peter notices Mr. Stark watching him. He glances over and gives his mentor a smile that doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. No need to make him worry on his day off.</p><p>\ud83d\udd78\u238a\ud83d\udd78</p><p>By the time lunch rolls around, they\u2019ve seen everything Flash wanted to see and one thing Peter wanted. Not that Peter\u2019s complaining\u2014everything has been awesome so far and he\u2019s still enjoyed all the animals. He could have done without Flash\u2019s snide comments and jabs every time they were out of earshot of their chaperone\u2014\u201cI didn\u2019t know they had a Make-A-Wish for orphans, Parker\u201d\u2014but at least Mr. Stark seems to be having a good time, which, if he\u2019s being honest, is infinitely more important to Peter.</p><p>They stop at one of the restaurants near the entrance. When Mr. Stark offers to pay for the meal, Flash decides to order the most expensive thing on the menu, complete with a large soda and a large cup of ice cream. Peter, who\u2019s gotten used to Mr. Stark paying for things for him at this point, sticks with chicken fingers and fries and a small pink lemonade, because why not?</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker,\u201d Flash says as they sit down at a table with their trays of food, \u201ccan I look at your worksheet? I wanna check my answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Peter responds, knowing full well Flash hasn\u2019t written a single word on his.</p><p>While Flash is very obviously copying Peter\u2019s work, Peter and Mr. Stark talk about school, the company, and the engagement. They don\u2019t mention Peter\u2019s \u201cextra-curricular activities\u201d with someone else sitting so near, though Peter is dying to discuss his new web formula that he hasn\u2019t gotten to show his mentor yet. But he restrains himself, knowing he\u2019ll be heading to the compound that afternoon and can show him then.</p><p>Once they\u2019ve all finished their lunches, they head out to see the rest of the habitats.</p><p>\u201cI wanna go see the grizzly bear,\u201d Flash tells them.</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait, hold on,\u201d Mr. Stark says, putting a hand in the air. \u201cYou got to pick last time, let\u2019s let Peter have a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter assures him. \u201cWe can go see the grizzly bear first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d he replies. \u201cI wanna know what you want to see, kid.\u201d</p><p>Trying to hide his rising blush, Peter mumbles, \u201cWell, I kinda wanted to visit the penguins\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark smiles at him\u2014not his press smile, but a real one. \u201cWonderful! Let\u2019s go see the penguins.\u201d</p><p>As he puts a hand on the boys\u2019 shoulders and begins steering them toward the Polar Circle exhibit, Peter resolutely ignores Flash\u2019s almost murderous glare directed at him and focuses instead on the signs pointing them in the right direction.</p><p>The penguins are adorable and without a doubt his favorite animal of the day. They arrive just in time to feed them, much to Peter\u2019s delight. With a fascinated gleam in his eyes, he watches the penguins snap at the fish people throw to them. Mr. Stark pats him on the back when he manages to toss a fish right into a penguin\u2019s mouth; when Flash does the same thing, he gets a tight-lipped smile. Peter\u2019s positively beaming by the time they leave to head to the grizzly bears, and when Mr. Stark wraps an arm around his shoulders, he thinks he might actually die of happiness.</p><p>Of course, Flash just has to ruin it.</p><p>They\u2019re waiting for Mr. Stark on a bench outside the bathrooms at the end of the day when Flash casually leans over to him. \u201cSo, Parker, how much did it cost you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did what cost me?\u201d Peter asks, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cThe actor,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much did you pay him to pretend to be Tony Stark?\u201d</p><p>Huffing in annoyance, Peter crosses his arms over his chest and tells him, \u201cI didn\u2019t pay anyone, Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you didn\u2019t,\u201d Flash says with a smug grin.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Peter insists. \u201cThat\u2019s actually Mr. Stark, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, and I\u2019m actually Captain America.\u201d</p><p>Peter stiffens a little, but Flash doesn\u2019t notice. It\u2019s a very good thing Mr. Stark isn\u2019t around to hear this conversation.</p><p>\u201cBe real, Parker,\u201d Flash says. \u201cEven if you were really Tony Stark\u2019s intern\u2014which you\u2019re obviously not\u2014why the hell would he agree to go on a school field trip with <i>you</i> of all people?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how to respond to that, because really, why <i>would</i> Mr. Stark want to go on a field trip with him? He knows pretty much everything about Peter. Maybe he feels sorry for him because it\u2019s just him and May now. Peter\u2019s well used to people\u2019s pity because of Ben and his parents. Is Mr. Stark just like everyone else? Just tolerating him because he\u2019s a charity case?</p><p>He\u2019s saved from trying to come up with a reply.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d says a voice to their left, \u201cit\u2019s because I enjoy Peter\u2019s company, which is more than I can say for you.\u201d</p><p>The boys turn to see Mr. Stark standing at the other end of the bench, looking down at them through his sunglasses.</p><p>Flash sputters, trying to lessen the blow. \u201cM-Mr. Stark, I didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Mr. Stark says with an eye roll, \u201cor you would have kept your mouth shut and not harassed my intern. Although, honestly, I\u2019m kinda glad you did. Because that just confirms how much of a jerk I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>The expression painting Flash\u2019s face is priceless. Abject terror mixed with shame and just a dash of irritation at being caught. It makes up for every bad thing that happened that day.</p><p>Mr. Stark pushes his sunglasses back up his nose and sniffs. \u201cSo, Mr. Thompson, I would suggest you apologize to Peter\u2014and you better mean it\u2014and walk your little butt back to the bus. And you should probably wait for me so the two of us can have a word with your teacher.\u201d</p><p>After a very forced apology, Flash picks himself up off the bench and trudges over to the exit. Before he gets very far though, Mr. Starks calls after him, \u201cAnd Flash?\u201d</p><p>The teen glances back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou can rest assured that I am very much the real Tony Stark,\u201d he finishes, flashing his press smile. Then, turning to Peter, he asks, \u201cYou good, kid?\u201d</p><p>Peter, who\u2019s been a silent observer this whole time, has to physically stop himself from tackling the man.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen! You totally tore Flash apart! I\u2019ve never seen him so scared in my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m just glad he decided to keep his mouth shut and not try to lie his way out.\u201d Mr. Stark meets Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cDoes that happen a lot?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing the back of his neck, Peter responds, \u201cWell, yeah, I guess. But I can handle Flash on my own, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. He\u2019s a bully to everyone, and I\u2019m kinda used to it, so I\u2019ve got a thick skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, kid,\u201d Mr. Stark says. There\u2019s a small pause before he speaks again. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to worry, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allowed to worry about you,\u201d he explains. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re Spider-Man and you stop crime every night and you\u2019ve got freaky spider powers, but all that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re a kid. And more than that\u2026 you\u2019re my kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter stares at him wide-eyed, not daring to speak.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not the most responsible person in the world,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible influence on you, and really, I\u2019m surprised your aunt even lets me near you, but\u2014\u201d he takes a deep breath\u2014\u201cI\u2019m trying. I\u2019m new to the whole \u2018co-parenting/mentor\u2019 thing and there\u2019s no doubt I\u2019m gonna have many f\u2014mess ups in the future, but I wanna do right by you and May. And if that means worrying about you every once in a while when you\u2019re not parading around in spandex, then you gotta let me worry a bit.\u201d</p><p>For a long second, there\u2019s silence between them. Then, before he can help himself, Peter jumps up and wraps his arms around Mr. Stark. There\u2019s only a slight moment of hesitation before Mr. Stark hugs him back.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter says, pulling away. \u201cFor everything. Today was awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven with Mr. Rain Cloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>With an arm slung over Peter\u2019s shoulder, Mr. Stark leads the two of them to the bus, where the rest of the class is waiting.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter answers, gazing up at the man next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna have a movie night tonight?\u201d he proposes. \u201cYou get to pick the movie, so long as it\u2019s not Star Wars or anything Disney\u2014God knows we\u2019ve watched them enough times. I\u2019ll even see if Pepper\u2019s free. We can make popcorn and eat whatever flavor of ice cream you want. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s practically bouncing alongside him as his head bobs up and down. \u201cThat would be totally awesome, Mr. Stark! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pick a good movie, I promise.\u201d</p><p>And together they rejoin Peter\u2019s classmates, playfully debating whether <i>The Godfather</i> is really an appropriate movie for a sixteen-year-old.<br/></p>",

He needs something to take away his anxiety and help him clear his head a little.</p><p>Hot chocolate. He needs hot chocolate.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He makes his way to the kitchen, through the maze of hallways in the compound. As he waits for the milk to heat up in the microwave, Peter begins a list in his head: May is obviously out of the question; Mr. Stark would never in a million years agree to watch a bunch of snot-nosed teens for a day; Ms. Potts has a company to run and Peter wouldn\u2019t want to bother her with something like this; there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ask Vision to do it, either; and since Colonel Rhodes is still on the mend, Peter doesn\u2019t want to put any more unneeded stress on the man.</p><p>Peter is in quite the pickle.</p><p>The microwave dings. Peter pulls out the warm milk and adds the cocoa powder, stirring gently. On his way back to the other side of the island, he grabs a couple cookies from Mr. Stark\u2019s secret stash. As he sinks into his chair and takes that first chocolatey sip, he hears footsteps coming from the direction of the lab. Peter turns to see Mr. Stark enter the kitchen, coffee mug in hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d he greets, patting Peter\u2019s shoulder before taking his mug to the sink.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter returns. He takes another sip of hot chocolate and tries to think of more possibilities.</p><p>Mr. Stark pauses, looking back at the teen sitting in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you, kid? Something happen on patrol last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter admits, \u201cI\u2019m just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I smelled something burning.\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a face at his mentor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Mr. Stark asks. He leans on the counter across from him.</p><p>Sighing, Peter explains, \u201cMy Environmental Science class is going on a field trip to the zoo on Friday and May was supposed to chaperone, except now she has to cover for her coworker all week so she can\u2019t go. And that means I need to find someone to fill in for her or my teacher is gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark thinks for a moment, stroking his goatee.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that does sound like quite the predicament,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe only people I could think of were you, Ms. Potts, Vision, and Colonel Rhodes, but Ms. Potts has a company to run and Vision would just raise a bunch of questions and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait, what about me?\u201d</p><p>Peter rubs the back of his neck. \u201cWell, I figured you\u2019d have better things to do than spend the day at a zoo with a bunch of teenagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cThe zoo sounds way better than going to boring meetings and pretending to pay attention all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally. When did you say it was?\u201d he asks, already pulling out his phone.</p><p>Peter can\u2019t help the excitement blooming in his chest as he tells him, \u201cIt\u2019s this Friday. We have to be at school at the normal time\u2014which is 8 if you didn\u2019t know\u2014and then we\u2019re gonna head over to the Central Park Zoo and we get to do whatever we want\u2014within reason, obviously\u2014and we can go anywhere in the zoo as long as we\u2019re with an adult, but we do have to head to certain habitats because we\u2019re gonna have a worksheet to fill out that we have to hand in so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark raises a hand, effectively cutting Peter off from his rambles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fill in for your aunt as long as you don\u2019t talk my ear off while we\u2019re there,\u201d he proposes. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d Peter says, grinning broadly. A thought quickly comes to his mind and his smile falters just slightly. \u201cUh, Mr. Stark, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have your clearances already, would you?\u201d</p><p>\ud83d\udd78\u238a\ud83d\udd78</p><p>Friday comes quickly for Peter. Environmental Science isn\u2019t necessarily his favorite class this year, but he can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s super excited to go to the zoo, especially since Mr. Stark will be there.</p><p>That morning, he catches an earlier train to make sure he definitely won\u2019t be late. He also maybe kinda sorta wants to be there before Mr. Stark gets there.</p><p>When he gets to Midtown, there are already a few kids from his class milling in front of the entrance; the ones who notice him approach offer small smiles. By the time everyone in the class shows up, there are five minutes until they have to leave and Mr. Stark is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Peter tries not to panic too much. He might be stuck in traffic or want to be fashionably late\u2026 or he forgot entirely. Peter quickly shoves the thought from his mind. No, Mr. Stark is a lot of things but forgetful isn\u2019t usually one of them. Plus, he seemed like he was actually looking forward to this when they talked on the phone the other night.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter glances over his shoulder to see his teacher looking at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon, Mrs. Hernandez,\u201d he assures her. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>But then there are two minutes until they have to leave and still no Mr. Stark. The other kids are beginning to get annoyed with him, he can tell, because they just want to get the trip started. Peter checks his phone, in case he missed any calls from the man, when a car engine catches his attention.</p><p>He raises his head just as one of Mr. Stark\u2019s fancy cars pulls into the parking lot and parks a few spaces away from the class. Mr. Stark gets out of the car and straightens his crisp black suit before walking over to the group of students gawking at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, teach,\u201d he calls, adjusting his sunglasses. \u201cTraffic was a mess.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hernandez just nods dumbly.</p><p>When Mr. Stark reaches Peter, he clasps a hand on his shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You ready for the zoo, Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born ready,\u201d he says. \u201cI should probably go meet with the boss lady before we go, so we\u2019ll talk later, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr. Stark!\u201d says Peter.</p><p>As soon as Mr. Stark is somewhat out of earshot, the rest of the class descends on Peter, their voices blurring together.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Tony Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Parker, I didn\u2019t think you were serious about that internship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you ask him if I can get a picture?\u201d</p><p>Peter tries to answer their questions despite his quickening breaths and the growing headache behind his eyes. He\u2019s never been good at being the center of attention, but with his heightened senses, the sudden increase of noise makes him feel even worse.</p><p>Eventually, Mrs. Hernandez calls for everyone to get on the bus and Peter breathes a sigh of relief. He climbs on behind Cindy and takes a seat toward the back of the bus, some distance away from everyone else. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s trying to be antisocial or anything, he just needs some time alone to chill out and let himself calm down a little. He doesn\u2019t get very far into his \u201cme time\u201d before Mrs. Hernandez is addressing the class.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be splitting up into groups before we get to the zoo and I\u2019ll hand out the worksheets then,\u201d she tells them. \u201cEveryone must be part of a group and you must stay with a chaperone at all times.\u201d</p><p>All heads swivel toward Peter expectantly, and he slumps in his seat, trying to disappear on the spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already chosen your groups, guys,\u201d Mrs. Hernandez says quickly, earning more than a few groans up and down the bus. She starts reading names off of a list, pairing kids with one of the nine chaperones. If Peter\u2019s math is correct, and it usually is, that means there should be three kids per group, with one group of two. Mr. Stark\u2019s name is the last one read, followed by, \u201cMr. Parker and Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart sinks to the pavement racing beneath the bus. Twenty-six other kids in the class and it just has to be <i>him</i>. A few rows ahead, Flash turns around, giving Peter a wicked grin, and all of Peter\u2019s excitement for the trip disappears at once.</p><p>An hour later, the bus pulls up outside of the Central Park Zoo and everyone clambers off to stand with their groups; Flash makes sure to step on Peter\u2019s foot when Mr. Stark isn\u2019t looking. Despite the flare of pain, Peter doesn\u2019t say a word. He\u2019s been waiting for this all week, and he\u2019s not about to let Flash ruin it for him.</p><p>Once Mrs. Hernandez has passed out the worksheets and everyone has gone through security and the ticket stalls, they\u2019re free to do whatever they want.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do you want to go first, boys?\u201d Mr. Stark asks, his eyes scanning the map he\u2019d picked up at the entrance.</p><p>Peter opens his mouth to respond, but Flash doesn\u2019t give him the chance.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see the poison dart frogs!\u201d he says. It doesn\u2019t sound much like a suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYou good with that, Pete?\u201d</p><p>Even though he really wants to see the penguins, Peter shrugs and replies, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As they set off for the frogs, Flash in the lead, Peter notices Mr. Stark watching him. He glances over and gives his mentor a smile that doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. No need to make him worry on his day off.</p><p>\ud83d\udd78\u238a\ud83d\udd78</p><p>By the time lunch rolls around, they\u2019ve seen everything Flash wanted to see and one thing Peter wanted. Not that Peter\u2019s complaining\u2014everything has been awesome so far and he\u2019s still enjoyed all the animals. He could have done without Flash\u2019s snide comments and jabs every time they were out of earshot of their chaperone\u2014\u201cI didn\u2019t know they had a Make-A-Wish for orphans, Parker\u201d\u2014but at least Mr. Stark seems to be having a good time, which, if he\u2019s being honest, is infinitely more important to Peter.</p><p>They stop at one of the restaurants near the entrance. When Mr. Stark offers to pay for the meal, Flash decides to order the most expensive thing on the menu, complete with a large soda and a large cup of ice cream. Peter, who\u2019s gotten used to Mr. Stark paying for things for him at this point, sticks with chicken fingers and fries and a small pink lemonade, because why not?</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker,\u201d Flash says as they sit down at a table with their trays of food, \u201ccan I look at your worksheet? I wanna check my answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Peter responds, knowing full well Flash hasn\u2019t written a single word on his.</p><p>While Flash is very obviously copying Peter\u2019s work, Peter and Mr. Stark talk about school, the company, and the engagement. They don\u2019t mention Peter\u2019s \u201cextra-curricular activities\u201d with someone else sitting so near, though Peter is dying to discuss his new web formula that he hasn\u2019t gotten to show his mentor yet. But he restrains himself, knowing he\u2019ll be heading to the compound that afternoon and can show him then.</p><p>Once they\u2019ve all finished their lunches, they head out to see the rest of the habitats.</p><p>\u201cI wanna go see the grizzly bear,\u201d Flash tells them.</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait, hold on,\u201d Mr. Stark says, putting a hand in the air. \u201cYou got to pick last time, let\u2019s let Peter have a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter assures him. \u201cWe can go see the grizzly bear first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d he replies. \u201cI wanna know what you want to see, kid.\u201d</p><p>Trying to hide his rising blush, Peter mumbles, \u201cWell, I kinda wanted to visit the penguins\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark smiles at him\u2014not his press smile, but a real one. \u201cWonderful! Let\u2019s go see the penguins.\u201d</p><p>As he puts a hand on the boys\u2019 shoulders and begins steering them toward the Polar Circle exhibit, Peter resolutely ignores Flash\u2019s almost murderous glare directed at him and focuses instead on the signs pointing them in the right direction.</p><p>The penguins are adorable and without a doubt his favorite animal of the day. They arrive just in time to feed them, much to Peter\u2019s delight. With a fascinated gleam in his eyes, he watches the penguins snap at the fish people throw to them. Mr. Stark pats him on the back when he manages to toss a fish right into a penguin\u2019s mouth; when Flash does the same thing, he gets a tight-lipped smile. Peter\u2019s positively beaming by the time they leave to head to the grizzly bears, and when Mr. Stark wraps an arm around his shoulders, he thinks he might actually die of happiness.</p><p>Of course, Flash just has to ruin it.</p><p>They\u2019re waiting for Mr. Stark on a bench outside the bathrooms at the end of the day when Flash casually leans over to him. \u201cSo, Parker, how much did it cost you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did what cost me?\u201d Peter asks, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cThe actor,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much did you pay him to pretend to be Tony Stark?\u201d</p><p>Huffing in annoyance, Peter crosses his arms over his chest and tells him, \u201cI didn\u2019t pay anyone, Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you didn\u2019t,\u201d Flash says with a smug grin.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Peter insists. \u201cThat\u2019s actually Mr. Stark, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, and I\u2019m actually Captain America.\u201d</p><p>Peter stiffens a little, but Flash doesn\u2019t notice. It\u2019s a very good thing Mr. Stark isn\u2019t around to hear this conversation.</p><p>\u201cBe real, Parker,\u201d Flash says. \u201cEven if you were really Tony Stark\u2019s intern\u2014which you\u2019re obviously not\u2014why the hell would he agree to go on a school field trip with <i>you</i> of all people?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how to respond to that, because really, why <i>would</i> Mr. Stark want to go on a field trip with him? He knows pretty much everything about Peter. Maybe he feels sorry for him because it\u2019s just him and May now. Peter\u2019s well used to people\u2019s pity because of Ben and his parents. Is Mr. Stark just like everyone else? Just tolerating him because he\u2019s a charity case?</p><p>He\u2019s saved from trying to come up with a reply.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d says a voice to their left, \u201cit\u2019s because I enjoy Peter\u2019s company, which is more than I can say for you.\u201d</p><p>The boys turn to see Mr. Stark standing at the other end of the bench, looking down at them through his sunglasses.</p><p>Flash sputters, trying to lessen the blow. \u201cM-Mr. Stark, I didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Mr. Stark says with an eye roll, \u201cor you would have kept your mouth shut and not harassed my intern. Although, honestly, I\u2019m kinda glad you did. Because that just confirms how much of a jerk I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>The expression painting Flash\u2019s face is priceless. Abject terror mixed with shame and just a dash of irritation at being caught. It makes up for every bad thing that happened that day.</p><p>Mr. Stark pushes his sunglasses back up his nose and sniffs. \u201cSo, Mr. Thompson, I would suggest you apologize to Peter\u2014and you better mean it\u2014and walk your little butt back to the bus. And you should probably wait for me so the two of us can have a word with your teacher.\u201d</p><p>After a very forced apology, Flash picks himself up off the bench and trudges over to the exit. Before he gets very far though, Mr. Starks calls after him, \u201cAnd Flash?\u201d</p><p>The teen glances back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou can rest assured that I am very much the real Tony Stark,\u201d he finishes, flashing his press smile. Then, turning to Peter, he asks, \u201cYou good, kid?\u201d</p><p>Peter, who\u2019s been a silent observer this whole time, has to physically stop himself from tackling the man.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen! You totally tore Flash apart! I\u2019ve never seen him so scared in my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m just glad he decided to keep his mouth shut and not try to lie his way out.\u201d Mr. Stark meets Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cDoes that happen a lot?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing the back of his neck, Peter responds, \u201cWell, yeah, I guess. But I can handle Flash on my own, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. He\u2019s a bully to everyone, and I\u2019m kinda used to it, so I\u2019ve got a thick skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, kid,\u201d Mr. Stark says. There\u2019s a small pause before he speaks again. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to worry, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allowed to worry about you,\u201d he explains. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re Spider-Man and you stop crime every night and you\u2019ve got freaky spider powers, but all that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re a kid. And more than that\u2026 you\u2019re my kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter stares at him wide-eyed, not daring to speak.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not the most responsible person in the world,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible influence on you, and really, I\u2019m surprised your aunt even lets me near you, but\u2014\u201d he takes a deep breath\u2014\u201cI\u2019m trying. I\u2019m new to the whole \u2018co-parenting/mentor\u2019 thing and there\u2019s no doubt I\u2019m gonna have many f\u2014mess ups in the future, but I wanna do right by you and May. And if that means worrying about you every once in a while when you\u2019re not parading around in spandex, then you gotta let me worry a bit.\u201d</p><p>For a long second, there\u2019s silence between them. Then, before he can help himself, Peter jumps up and wraps his arms around Mr. Stark. There\u2019s only a slight moment of hesitation before Mr. Stark hugs him back.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter says, pulling away. \u201cFor everything. Today was awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven with Mr. Rain Cloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>With an arm slung over Peter\u2019s shoulder, Mr. Stark leads the two of them to the bus, where the rest of the class is waiting.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter answers, gazing up at the man next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna have a movie night tonight?\u201d he proposes. \u201cYou get to pick the movie, so long as it\u2019s not Star Wars or anything Disney\u2014God knows we\u2019ve watched them enough times. I\u2019ll even see if Pepper\u2019s free. We can make popcorn and eat whatever flavor of ice cream you want. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s practically bouncing alongside him as his head bobs up and down. \u201cThat would be totally awesome, Mr. Stark! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pick a good movie, I promise.\u201d</p><p>And together they rejoin Peter\u2019s classmates, playfully debating whether <i>The Godfather</i> is really an appropriate movie for a sixteen-year-old.<br></p>",

Shoutout to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myTmHi6hNWABfFiGG84Caww\">@peterparkerisntdead</a> for giving me ideas for this and being the most valid mutual on this website. You a real one bruh.</p><p>Words: 3,100</p><p>Characters: Peter Parker, Tony Stark, Flash Thompson, May Parker (mentioned)</p><p>Warnings: Major fluffiness, a smidge of angst, a bit of bullying, lots of Irondad</p><p><i>Hope you enjoy it!</i></p><p>Peter is so totally screwed and that\u2019s just a fact at this point.</p><p>Not that he blames May, of course. There\u2019s no way she could have known she\u2019d get called into work so suddenly. It\u2019s just, well\u2026 he needs another chaperone. And where on earth is he going to find someone now, just days before the field trip?</p><p>Peter puts his phone down on his desk and runs a hand over his face. He needs something to take away his anxiety and help him clear his head a little.</p><p>Hot chocolate. He needs hot chocolate.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He makes his way to the kitchen, through the maze of hallways in the compound. As he waits for the milk to heat up in the microwave, Peter begins a list in his head: May is obviously out of the question; Mr. Stark would never in a million years agree to watch a bunch of snot-nosed teens for a day; Ms. Potts has a company to run and Peter wouldn\u2019t want to bother her with something like this; there\u2019s no way he\u2019d ask Vision to do it, either; and since Colonel Rhodes is still on the mend, Peter doesn\u2019t want to put any more unneeded stress on the man.</p><p>Peter is in quite the pickle.</p><p>The microwave dings. Peter pulls out the warm milk and adds the cocoa powder, stirring gently. On his way back to the other side of the island, he grabs a couple cookies from Mr. Stark\u2019s secret stash. As he sinks into his chair and takes that first chocolatey sip, he hears footsteps coming from the direction of the lab. Peter turns to see Mr. Stark enter the kitchen, coffee mug in hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d he greets, patting Peter\u2019s shoulder before taking his mug to the sink.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter returns. He takes another sip of hot chocolate and tries to think of more possibilities.</p><p>Mr. Stark pauses, looking back at the teen sitting in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you, kid? Something happen on patrol last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter admits, \u201cI\u2019m just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I smelled something burning.\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a face at his mentor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Mr. Stark asks. He leans on the counter across from him.</p><p>Sighing, Peter explains, \u201cMy Environmental Science class is going on a field trip to the zoo on Friday and May was supposed to chaperone, except now she has to cover for her coworker all week so she can\u2019t go. And that means I need to find someone to fill in for her or my teacher is gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark thinks for a moment, stroking his goatee.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that does sound like quite the predicament,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe only people I could think of were you, Ms. Potts, Vision, and Colonel Rhodes, but Ms. Potts has a company to run and Vision would just raise a bunch of questions and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait, what about me?\u201d</p><p>Peter rubs the back of his neck. \u201cWell, I figured you\u2019d have better things to do than spend the day at a zoo with a bunch of teenagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cThe zoo sounds way better than going to boring meetings and pretending to pay attention all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally. When did you say it was?\u201d he asks, already pulling out his phone.</p><p>Peter can\u2019t help the excitement blooming in his chest as he tells him, \u201cIt\u2019s this Friday. We have to be at school at the normal time\u2014which is 8 if you didn\u2019t know\u2014and then we\u2019re gonna head over to the Central Park Zoo and we get to do whatever we want\u2014within reason, obviously\u2014and we can go anywhere in the zoo as long as we\u2019re with an adult, but we do have to head to certain habitats because we\u2019re gonna have a worksheet to fill out that we have to hand in so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark raises a hand, effectively cutting Peter off from his rambles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fill in for your aunt as long as you don\u2019t talk my ear off while we\u2019re there,\u201d he proposes. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d Peter says, grinning broadly. A thought quickly comes to his mind and his smile falters just slightly. \u201cUh, Mr. Stark, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have your clearances already, would you?\u201d</p><p>\ud83d\udd78\u238a\ud83d\udd78</p><p>Friday comes quickly for Peter. Environmental Science isn\u2019t necessarily his favorite class this year, but he can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s super excited to go to the zoo, especially since Mr. Stark will be there.</p><p>That morning, he catches an earlier train to make sure he definitely won\u2019t be late. He also maybe kinda sorta wants to be there before Mr. Stark gets there.</p><p>When he gets to Midtown, there are already a few kids from his class milling in front of the entrance; the ones who notice him approach offer small smiles. By the time everyone in the class shows up, there are five minutes until they have to leave and Mr. Stark is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Peter tries not to panic too much. He might be stuck in traffic or want to be fashionably late\u2026 or he forgot entirely. Peter quickly shoves the thought from his mind. No, Mr. Stark is a lot of things but forgetful isn\u2019t usually one of them. Plus, he seemed like he was actually looking forward to this when they talked on the phone the other night.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter glances over his shoulder to see his teacher looking at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon, Mrs. Hernandez,\u201d he assures her. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>But then there are two minutes until they have to leave and still no Mr. Stark. The other kids are beginning to get annoyed with him, he can tell, because they just want to get the trip started. Peter checks his phone, in case he missed any calls from the man, when a car engine catches his attention.</p><p>He raises his head just as one of Mr. Stark\u2019s fancy cars pulls into the parking lot and parks a few spaces away from the class. Mr. Stark gets out of the car and straightens his crisp black suit before walking over to the group of students gawking at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, teach,\u201d he calls, adjusting his sunglasses. \u201cTraffic was a mess.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hernandez just nods dumbly.</p><p>When Mr. Stark reaches Peter, he clasps a hand on his shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You ready for the zoo, Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born ready,\u201d he says. \u201cI should probably go meet with the boss lady before we go, so we\u2019ll talk later, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Mr. Stark!\u201d says Peter.</p><p>As soon as Mr. Stark is somewhat out of earshot, the rest of the class descends on Peter, their voices blurring together.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Tony Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Parker, I didn\u2019t think you were serious about that internship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you ask him if I can get a picture?\u201d</p><p>Peter tries to answer their questions despite his quickening breaths and the growing headache behind his eyes. He\u2019s never been good at being the center of attention, but with his heightened senses, the sudden increase of noise makes him feel even worse.</p><p>Eventually, Mrs. Hernandez calls for everyone to get on the bus and Peter breathes a sigh of relief. He climbs on behind Cindy and takes a seat toward the back of the bus, some distance away from everyone else. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s trying to be antisocial or anything, he just needs some time alone to chill out and let himself calm down a little. He doesn\u2019t get very far into his \u201cme time\u201d before Mrs. Hernandez is addressing the class.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be splitting up into groups before we get to the zoo and I\u2019ll hand out the worksheets then,\u201d she tells them. \u201cEveryone must be part of a group and you must stay with a chaperone at all times.\u201d</p><p>All heads swivel toward Peter expectantly, and he slumps in his seat, trying to disappear on the spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already chosen your groups, guys,\u201d Mrs. Hernandez says quickly, earning more than a few groans up and down the bus. She starts reading names off of a list, pairing kids with one of the nine chaperones. If Peter\u2019s math is correct, and it usually is, that means there should be three kids per group, with one group of two. Mr. Stark\u2019s name is the last one read, followed by, \u201cMr. Parker and Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart sinks to the pavement racing beneath the bus. Twenty-six other kids in the class and it just has to be <i>him</i>. A few rows ahead, Flash turns around, giving Peter a wicked grin, and all of Peter\u2019s excitement for the trip disappears at once.</p><p>An hour later, the bus pulls up outside of the Central Park Zoo and everyone clambers off to stand with their groups; Flash makes sure to step on Peter\u2019s foot when Mr. Stark isn\u2019t looking. Despite the flare of pain, Peter doesn\u2019t say a word. He\u2019s been waiting for this all week, and he\u2019s not about to let Flash ruin it for him.</p><p>Once Mrs. Hernandez has passed out the worksheets and everyone has gone through security and the ticket stalls, they\u2019re free to do whatever they want.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do you want to go first, boys?\u201d Mr. Stark asks, his eyes scanning the map he\u2019d picked up at the entrance.</p><p>Peter opens his mouth to respond, but Flash doesn\u2019t give him the chance.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see the poison dart frogs!\u201d he says. It doesn\u2019t sound much like a suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYou good with that, Pete?\u201d</p><p>Even though he really wants to see the penguins, Peter shrugs and replies, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As they set off for the frogs, Flash in the lead, Peter notices Mr. Stark watching him. He glances over and gives his mentor a smile that doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. No need to make him worry on his day off.</p><p>\ud83d\udd78\u238a\ud83d\udd78</p><p>By the time lunch rolls around, they\u2019ve seen everything Flash wanted to see and one thing Peter wanted. Not that Peter\u2019s complaining\u2014everything has been awesome so far and he\u2019s still enjoyed all the animals. He could have done without Flash\u2019s snide comments and jabs every time they were out of earshot of their chaperone\u2014\u201cI didn\u2019t know they had a Make-A-Wish for orphans, Parker\u201d\u2014but at least Mr. Stark seems to be having a good time, which, if he\u2019s being honest, is infinitely more important to Peter.</p><p>They stop at one of the restaurants near the entrance. When Mr. Stark offers to pay for the meal, Flash decides to order the most expensive thing on the menu, complete with a large soda and a large cup of ice cream. Peter, who\u2019s gotten used to Mr. Stark paying for things for him at this point, sticks with chicken fingers and fries and a small pink lemonade, because why not?</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker,\u201d Flash says as they sit down at a table with their trays of food, \u201ccan I look at your worksheet? I wanna check my answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Peter responds, knowing full well Flash hasn\u2019t written a single word on his.</p><p>While Flash is very obviously copying Peter\u2019s work, Peter and Mr. Stark talk about school, the company, and the engagement. They don\u2019t mention Peter\u2019s \u201cextra-curricular activities\u201d with someone else sitting so near, though Peter is dying to discuss his new web formula that he hasn\u2019t gotten to show his mentor yet. But he restrains himself, knowing he\u2019ll be heading to the compound that afternoon and can show him then.</p><p>Once they\u2019ve all finished their lunches, they head out to see the rest of the habitats.</p><p>\u201cI wanna go see the grizzly bear,\u201d Flash tells them.</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait, hold on,\u201d Mr. Stark says, putting a hand in the air. \u201cYou got to pick last time, let\u2019s let Peter have a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter assures him. \u201cWe can go see the grizzly bear first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d he replies. \u201cI wanna know what you want to see, kid.\u201d</p><p>Trying to hide his rising blush, Peter mumbles, \u201cWell, I kinda wanted to visit the penguins\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr. Stark smiles at him\u2014not his press smile, but a real one. \u201cWonderful! Let\u2019s go see the penguins.\u201d</p><p>As he puts a hand on the boys\u2019 shoulders and begins steering them toward the Polar Circle exhibit, Peter resolutely ignores Flash\u2019s almost murderous glare directed at him and focuses instead on the signs pointing them in the right direction.</p><p>The penguins are adorable and without a doubt his favorite animal of the day. They arrive just in time to feed them, much to Peter\u2019s delight. With a fascinated gleam in his eyes, he watches the penguins snap at the fish people throw to them. Mr. Stark pats him on the back when he manages to toss a fish right into a penguin\u2019s mouth; when Flash does the same thing, he gets a tight-lipped smile. Peter\u2019s positively beaming by the time they leave to head to the grizzly bears, and when Mr. Stark wraps an arm around his shoulders, he thinks he might actually die of happiness.</p><p>Of course, Flash just has to ruin it.</p><p>They\u2019re waiting for Mr. Stark on a bench outside the bathrooms at the end of the day when Flash casually leans over to him. \u201cSo, Parker, how much did it cost you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did what cost me?\u201d Peter asks, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cThe actor,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much did you pay him to pretend to be Tony Stark?\u201d</p><p>Huffing in annoyance, Peter crosses his arms over his chest and tells him, \u201cI didn\u2019t pay anyone, Flash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you didn\u2019t,\u201d Flash says with a smug grin.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Peter insists. \u201cThat\u2019s actually Mr. Stark, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, and I\u2019m actually Captain America.\u201d</p><p>Peter stiffens a little, but Flash doesn\u2019t notice. It\u2019s a very good thing Mr. Stark isn\u2019t around to hear this conversation.</p><p>\u201cBe real, Parker,\u201d Flash says. \u201cEven if you were really Tony Stark\u2019s intern\u2014which you\u2019re obviously not\u2014why the hell would he agree to go on a school field trip with <i>you</i> of all people?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how to respond to that, because really, why <i>would</i> Mr. Stark want to go on a field trip with him? He knows pretty much everything about Peter. Maybe he feels sorry for him because it\u2019s just him and May now. Peter\u2019s well used to people\u2019s pity because of Ben and his parents. Is Mr. Stark just like everyone else? Just tolerating him because he\u2019s a charity case?</p><p>He\u2019s saved from trying to come up with a reply.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d says a voice to their left, \u201cit\u2019s because I enjoy Peter\u2019s company, which is more than I can say for you.\u201d</p><p>The boys turn to see Mr. Stark standing at the other end of the bench, looking down at them through his sunglasses.</p><p>Flash sputters, trying to lessen the blow. \u201cM-Mr. Stark, I didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Mr. Stark says with an eye roll, \u201cor you would have kept your mouth shut and not harassed my intern. Although, honestly, I\u2019m kinda glad you did. Because that just confirms how much of a jerk I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>The expression painting Flash\u2019s face is priceless. Abject terror mixed with shame and just a dash of irritation at being caught. It makes up for every bad thing that happened that day.</p><p>Mr. Stark pushes his sunglasses back up his nose and sniffs. \u201cSo, Mr. Thompson, I would suggest you apologize to Peter\u2014and you better mean it\u2014and walk your little butt back to the bus. And you should probably wait for me so the two of us can have a word with your teacher.\u201d</p><p>After a very forced apology, Flash picks himself up off the bench and trudges over to the exit. Before he gets very far though, Mr. Starks calls after him, \u201cAnd Flash?\u201d</p><p>The teen glances back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou can rest assured that I am very much the real Tony Stark,\u201d he finishes, flashing his press smile. Then, turning to Peter, he asks, \u201cYou good, kid?\u201d</p><p>Peter, who\u2019s been a silent observer this whole time, has to physically stop himself from tackling the man.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen! You totally tore Flash apart! I\u2019ve never seen him so scared in my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m just glad he decided to keep his mouth shut and not try to lie his way out.\u201d Mr. Stark meets Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cDoes that happen a lot?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing the back of his neck, Peter responds, \u201cWell, yeah, I guess. But I can handle Flash on my own, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. He\u2019s a bully to everyone, and I\u2019m kinda used to it, so I\u2019ve got a thick skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, kid,\u201d Mr. Stark says. There\u2019s a small pause before he speaks again. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to worry, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allowed to worry about you,\u201d he explains. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re Spider-Man and you stop crime every night and you\u2019ve got freaky spider powers, but all that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re a kid. And more than that\u2026 you\u2019re my kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter stares at him wide-eyed, not daring to speak.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not the most responsible person in the world,\u201d Mr. Stark says. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible influence on you, and really, I\u2019m surprised your aunt even lets me near you, but\u2014\u201d he takes a deep breath\u2014\u201cI\u2019m trying. I\u2019m new to the whole \u2018co-parenting/mentor\u2019 thing and there\u2019s no doubt I\u2019m gonna have many f\u2014mess ups in the future, but I wanna do right by you and May. And if that means worrying about you every once in a while when you\u2019re not parading around in spandex, then you gotta let me worry a bit.\u201d</p><p>For a long second, there\u2019s silence between them. Then, before he can help himself, Peter jumps up and wraps his arms around Mr. Stark. There\u2019s only a slight moment of hesitation before Mr. Stark hugs him back.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter says, pulling away. \u201cFor everything. Today was awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven with Mr. Rain Cloud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>With an arm slung over Peter\u2019s shoulder, Mr. Stark leads the two of them to the bus, where the rest of the class is waiting.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mr. Stark?\u201d Peter answers, gazing up at the man next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna have a movie night tonight?\u201d he proposes. \u201cYou get to pick the movie, so long as it\u2019s not Star Wars or anything Disney\u2014God knows we\u2019ve watched them enough times. I\u2019ll even see if Pepper\u2019s free. We can make popcorn and eat whatever flavor of ice cream you want. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s practically bouncing alongside him as his head bobs up and down. \u201cThat would be totally awesome, Mr. Stark! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pick a good movie, I promise.\u201d</p><p>And together they rejoin Peter\u2019s classmates, playfully debating whether <i>The Godfather</i> is really an appropriate movie for a sixteen-year-old.<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been inspired by everyone on Tumblr so I wrote my first Irondad fic! Shoutout to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myTmHi6hNWABfFiGG84Caww\">@peterparkerisntdead</a> for giving me ideas for this and being the most valid mutual on this website. You a real one bruh.</p><p>Words: 3,100</p><p>Characters: Peter Parker, Tony Stark, Flash Thompson, May Parker (mentioned)</p><p>Warnings: Major fluffiness, a smidge of angst, a bit of bullying, lots of Irondad</p><p><i>Hope you enjoy it!</i></p><p>Peter is so totally screwed and that&rsquo;s just a fact at this point.</p><p>Not that he blames May, of course. There&rsquo;s no way she could have known she&rsquo;d get called into work so suddenly. It&rsquo;s just, well&hellip; he needs another chaperone. And where on earth is he going to find someone now, just days before the field trip?</p><p>Peter puts his phone down on his desk and runs a hand over his face. He needs something to take away his anxiety and help him clear his head a little.</p><p>Hot chocolate. He needs hot chocolate.</p><p>He makes his way to the kitchen, through the maze of hallways in the compound. As he waits for the milk to heat up in the microwave, Peter begins a list in his head: May is obviously out of the question; Mr. Stark would never in a million years agree to watch a bunch of snot-nosed teens for a day; Ms. Potts has a company to run and Peter wouldn&rsquo;t want to bother her with something like this; there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;d ask Vision to do it, either; and since Colonel Rhodes is still on the mend, Peter doesn&rsquo;t want to put any more unneeded stress on the man.</p><p>Peter is in quite the pickle.</p><p>The microwave dings. Peter pulls out the warm milk and adds the cocoa powder, stirring gently. On his way back to the other side of the island, he grabs a couple cookies from Mr. Stark&rsquo;s secret stash. As he sinks into his chair and takes that first chocolatey sip, he hears footsteps coming from the direction of the lab. Peter turns to see Mr. Stark enter the kitchen, coffee mug in hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Pete,&rdquo; he greets, patting Peter&rsquo;s shoulder before taking his mug to the sink.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; Peter returns. He takes another sip of hot chocolate and tries to think of more possibilities.</p><p>Mr. Stark pauses, looking back at the teen sitting in front of him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with you, kid? Something happen on patrol last night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peter admits, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thinking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I smelled something burning.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter makes a face at his mentor.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; Mr. Stark asks. He leans on the counter across from him.</p><p>Sighing, Peter explains, &ldquo;My Environmental Science class is going on a field trip to the zoo on Friday and May was supposed to chaperone, except now she has to cover for her coworker all week so she can&rsquo;t go. And that means I need to find someone to fill in for her or my teacher is gonna kill me.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Stark thinks for a moment, stroking his goatee.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that does sound like quite the predicament,&rdquo; he says quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;The only people I could think of were you, Ms. Potts, Vision, and Colonel Rhodes, but Ms. Potts has a company to run and Vision would just raise a bunch of questions and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, wait, what about me?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rubs the back of his neck. &ldquo;Well, I figured you&rsquo;d have better things to do than spend the day at a zoo with a bunch of teenagers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me?&rdquo; Mr. Stark says. &ldquo;The zoo sounds way better than going to boring meetings and pretending to pay attention all day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Totally. When did you say it was?&rdquo; he asks, already pulling out his phone.</p><p>Peter can&rsquo;t help the excitement blooming in his chest as he tells him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this Friday. We have to be at school at the normal time&mdash;which is 8 if you didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;and then we&rsquo;re gonna head over to the Central Park Zoo and we get to do whatever we want&mdash;within reason, obviously&mdash;and we can go anywhere in the zoo as long as we&rsquo;re with an adult, but we do have to head to certain habitats because we&rsquo;re gonna have a worksheet to fill out that we have to hand in so&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Stark raises a hand, effectively cutting Peter off from his rambles.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fill in for your aunt as long as you don&rsquo;t talk my ear off while we&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; he proposes. &ldquo;Deal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal!&rdquo; Peter says, grinning broadly. A thought quickly comes to his mind and his smile falters just slightly. &ldquo;Uh, Mr. Stark, you wouldn&rsquo;t happen to have your clearances already, would you?&rdquo;</p><p>&#128376;&#9098;&#128376;</p><p>Friday comes quickly for Peter. Environmental Science isn&rsquo;t necessarily his favorite class this year, but he can&rsquo;t deny that he&rsquo;s super excited to go to the zoo, especially since Mr. Stark will be there.</p><p>That morning, he catches an earlier train to make sure he definitely won&rsquo;t be late. He also maybe kinda sorta wants to be there before Mr. Stark gets there.</p><p>When he gets to Midtown, there are already a few kids from his class milling in front of the entrance; the ones who notice him approach offer small smiles. By the time everyone in the class shows up, there are five minutes until they have to leave and Mr. Stark is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Peter tries not to panic too much. He might be stuck in traffic or want to be fashionably late&hellip; or he forgot entirely. Peter quickly shoves the thought from his mind. No, Mr. Stark is a lot of things but forgetful isn&rsquo;t usually one of them. Plus, he seemed like he was actually looking forward to this when they talked on the phone the other night.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glances over his shoulder to see his teacher looking at him expectantly.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here soon, Mrs. Hernandez,&rdquo; he assures her. &ldquo;Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>But then there are two minutes until they have to leave and still no Mr. Stark. The other kids are beginning to get annoyed with him, he can tell, because they just want to get the trip started. Peter checks his phone, in case he missed any calls from the man, when a car engine catches his attention.</p><p>He raises his head just as one of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s fancy cars pulls into the parking lot and parks a few spaces away from the class. Mr. Stark gets out of the car and straightens his crisp black suit before walking over to the group of students gawking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late, teach,&rdquo; he calls, adjusting his sunglasses. &ldquo;Traffic was a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>Mrs. Hernandez just nods dumbly.</p><p>When Mr. Stark reaches Peter, he clasps a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going, kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good! You ready for the zoo, Mr. Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was born ready,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I should probably go meet with the boss lady before we go, so we&rsquo;ll talk later, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Mr. Stark!&rdquo; says Peter.</p><p>As soon as Mr. Stark is somewhat out of earshot, the rest of the class descends on Peter, their voices blurring together.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know Tony Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Holy crap, Parker, I didn&rsquo;t think you were serious about that internship!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you ask him if I can get a picture?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter tries to answer their questions despite his quickening breaths and the growing headache behind his eyes. He&rsquo;s never been good at being the center of attention, but with his heightened senses, the sudden increase of noise makes him feel even worse.</p><p>Eventually, Mrs. Hernandez calls for everyone to get on the bus and Peter breathes a sigh of relief. He climbs on behind Cindy and takes a seat toward the back of the bus, some distance away from everyone else. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s trying to be antisocial or anything, he just needs some time alone to chill out and let himself calm down a little. He doesn&rsquo;t get very far into his &ldquo;me time&rdquo; before Mrs. Hernandez is addressing the class.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be splitting up into groups before we get to the zoo and I&rsquo;ll hand out the worksheets then,&rdquo; she tells them. &ldquo;Everyone must be part of a group and you must stay with a chaperone at all times.&rdquo;</p><p>All heads swivel toward Peter expectantly, and he slumps in his seat, trying to disappear on the spot.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already chosen your groups, guys,&rdquo; Mrs. Hernandez says quickly, earning more than a few groans up and down the bus. She starts reading names off of a list, pairing kids with one of the nine chaperones. If Peter&rsquo;s math is correct, and it usually is, that means there should be three kids per group, with one group of two. Mr. Stark&rsquo;s name is the last one read, followed by, &ldquo;Mr. Parker and Mr. Thompson.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart sinks to the pavement racing beneath the bus. Twenty-six other kids in the class and it just has to be <i>him</i>. A few rows ahead, Flash turns around, giving Peter a wicked grin, and all of Peter&rsquo;s excitement for the trip disappears at once.</p><p>An hour later, the bus pulls up outside of the Central Park Zoo and everyone clambers off to stand with their groups; Flash makes sure to step on Peter&rsquo;s foot when Mr. Stark isn&rsquo;t looking. Despite the flare of pain, Peter doesn&rsquo;t say a word. He&rsquo;s been waiting for this all week, and he&rsquo;s not about to let Flash ruin it for him.</p><p>Once Mrs. Hernandez has passed out the worksheets and everyone has gone through security and the ticket stalls, they&rsquo;re free to do whatever they want.</p><p>&ldquo;So, where do you want to go first, boys?&rdquo; Mr. Stark asks, his eyes scanning the map he&rsquo;d picked up at the entrance.</p><p>Peter opens his mouth to respond, but Flash doesn&rsquo;t give him the chance.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see the poison dart frogs!&rdquo; he says. It doesn&rsquo;t sound much like a suggestion.</p><p>&ldquo;You good with that, Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>Even though he really wants to see the penguins, Peter shrugs and replies, &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>As they set off for the frogs, Flash in the lead, Peter notices Mr. Stark watching him. He glances over and gives his mentor a smile that doesn&rsquo;t quite reach his eyes. No need to make him worry on his day off.</p><p>&#128376;&#9098;&#128376;</p><p>By the time lunch rolls around, they&rsquo;ve seen everything Flash wanted to see and one thing Peter wanted. Not that Peter&rsquo;s complaining&mdash;everything has been awesome so far and he&rsquo;s still enjoyed all the animals. He could have done without Flash&rsquo;s snide comments and jabs every time they were out of earshot of their chaperone&mdash;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they had a Make-A-Wish for orphans, Parker&rdquo;&mdash;but at least Mr. Stark seems to be having a good time, which, if he&rsquo;s being honest, is infinitely more important to Peter.</p><p>They stop at one of the restaurants near the entrance. When Mr. Stark offers to pay for the meal, Flash decides to order the most expensive thing on the menu, complete with a large soda and a large cup of ice cream. Peter, who&rsquo;s gotten used to Mr. Stark paying for things for him at this point, sticks with chicken fingers and fries and a small pink lemonade, because why not?</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Parker,&rdquo; Flash says as they sit down at a table with their trays of food, &ldquo;can I look at your worksheet? I wanna check my answers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; Peter responds, knowing full well Flash hasn&rsquo;t written a single word on his.</p><p>While Flash is very obviously copying Peter&rsquo;s work, Peter and Mr. Stark talk about school, the company, and the engagement. They don&rsquo;t mention Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;extra-curricular activities&rdquo; with someone else sitting so near, though Peter is dying to discuss his new web formula that he hasn&rsquo;t gotten to show his mentor yet. But he restrains himself, knowing he&rsquo;ll be heading to the compound that afternoon and can show him then.</p><p>Once they&rsquo;ve all finished their lunches, they head out to see the rest of the habitats.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanna go see the grizzly bear,&rdquo; Flash tells them.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, wait, hold on,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says, putting a hand in the air. &ldquo;You got to pick last time, let&rsquo;s let Peter have a turn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; Peter assures him. &ldquo;We can go see the grizzly bear first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;I wanna know what you want to see, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Trying to hide his rising blush, Peter mumbles, &ldquo;Well, I kinda wanted to visit the penguins&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Stark smiles at him&mdash;not his press smile, but a real one. &ldquo;Wonderful! Let&rsquo;s go see the penguins.&rdquo;</p><p>As he puts a hand on the boys&rsquo; shoulders and begins steering them toward the Polar Circle exhibit, Peter resolutely ignores Flash&rsquo;s almost murderous glare directed at him and focuses instead on the signs pointing them in the right direction.</p><p>The penguins are adorable and without a doubt his favorite animal of the day. They arrive just in time to feed them, much to Peter&rsquo;s delight. With a fascinated gleam in his eyes, he watches the penguins snap at the fish people throw to them. Mr. Stark pats him on the back when he manages to toss a fish right into a penguin&rsquo;s mouth; when Flash does the same thing, he gets a tight-lipped smile. Peter&rsquo;s positively beaming by the time they leave to head to the grizzly bears, and when Mr. Stark wraps an arm around his shoulders, he thinks he might actually die of happiness.</p><p>Of course, Flash just has to ruin it.</p><p>They&rsquo;re waiting for Mr. Stark on a bench outside the bathrooms at the end of the day when Flash casually leans over to him. &ldquo;So, Parker, how much did it cost you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How much did what cost me?&rdquo; Peter asks, bewildered.</p><p>&ldquo;The actor,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;How much did you pay him to pretend to be Tony Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>Huffing in annoyance, Peter crosses his arms over his chest and tells him, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pay anyone, Flash.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Flash says with a smug grin.</p><p>&ldquo;No, seriously, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Peter insists. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually Mr. Stark, I swear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, and I&rsquo;m actually Captain America.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stiffens a little, but Flash doesn&rsquo;t notice.

He&rsquo;s a bully to everyone, and I&rsquo;m kinda used to it, so I&rsquo;ve got a thick skin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you say so, kid,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says. There&rsquo;s a small pause before he speaks again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m allowed to worry, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m allowed to worry about you,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re Spider-Man and you stop crime every night and you&rsquo;ve got freaky spider powers, but all that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that you&rsquo;re a kid. And more than that&hellip; you&rsquo;re my kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stares at him wide-eyed, not daring to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not the most responsible person in the world,&rdquo; Mr. Stark says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a terrible influence on you, and really, I&rsquo;m surprised your aunt even lets me near you, but&mdash;&rdquo; he takes a deep breath&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying. I&rsquo;m new to the whole &lsquo;co-parenting/mentor&rsquo; thing and there&rsquo;s no doubt I&rsquo;m gonna have many f&mdash;mess ups in the future, but I wanna do right by you and May. And if that means worrying about you every once in a while when you&rsquo;re not parading around in spandex, then you gotta let me worry a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>For a long second, there&rsquo;s silence between them. Then, before he can help himself, Peter jumps up and wraps his arms around Mr. Stark. There&rsquo;s only a slight moment of hesitation before Mr. Stark hugs him back.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; Peter says, pulling away. &ldquo;For everything. Today was awesome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even with Mr. Rain Cloud?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Totally.&rdquo;</p><p>With an arm slung over Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, Mr. Stark leads the two of them to the bus, where the rest of the class is waiting.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Peter answers, gazing up at the man next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You wanna have a movie night tonight?&rdquo; he proposes. &ldquo;You get to pick the movie, so long as it&rsquo;s not Star Wars or anything Disney&mdash;God knows we&rsquo;ve watched them enough times. I&rsquo;ll even see if Pepper&rsquo;s free. We can make popcorn and eat whatever flavor of ice cream you want. What do you say?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s practically bouncing alongside him as his head bobs up and down. &ldquo;That would be totally awesome, Mr. Stark! Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll pick a good movie, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>And together they rejoin Peter&rsquo;s classmates, playfully debating whether <i>The Godfather</i> is really an appropriate movie for a sixteen-year-old.<br /></p>",
