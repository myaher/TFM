The whole way back home is quiet. If you listen close enough it\u2019s like you could hear each other\u2019s breathing. Occasional sniffles is also heard but nobody says anything about it. We all feel a void in ourselves. We feel like failures. We didn\u2019t stop the enemy from space. We should\u2019ve stopped him, we should\u2019ve tried harder. Now half of the people are gone and we don\u2019t who those people were. </p><p>I try to text Tony one more time but he doesn\u2019t answer. I call him multiple times but theirs no answer. </p><p><i>C\u2019mon dad where are you.</i></p><p>I text and call all of my friends but none of them answer. I text Harry and he answers with a simple \u2018here\u2019.  I call him and he answers on the first ring. </p><p><b>\u2018Hey. Hey you\u2019re here. Oh god.\u2019 I tell him through the phone a sigh of relief escaping my lips. </b></p><p><b>\u2018Alexandria are you okay? What\u2019s going on?\u2019 He sounded frantic.</b></p><p><b>\u2018It\u2019s-its I- can I explain later? Are you home?\u2019</b></p><p><b>\u2018Im here.. can you come over? when you can please.\u2019</b></p><p><b>\u2018I will I\u2019ll see you.\u2019</b></p><p><b>\u2018See ya.\u2019</b></p><p>And like that the phone went silent. I tried calling my dad one more time but nothing no answer. I tried calling Peter but also no answer. I throw my phone on the ground and I could see that I scared a couple of people that were lost in their own thoughts. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I mumble. I rest my head in my hands and sigh. I feel frustrated with the lack of answers I\u2019m getting from my dad Tony and Peter. </p><p><i>hopefully they\u2019re both still alive.</i></p><p>- </p><p>I knocked on the door a couple of times. I was nervous that Harry was not going to answer even if he did tell me he was here. </p><p>When I made my way here even if I did fly to get here I still saw the destruction of what had happened. Cars wrecked or inside of buildings. Things all over the place. The normal sound of car horns or police was not heard. It was all quiet in the city. Something not common at all. Made me feel even worse then I already felt. </p><p>The door was thrown open. I immediatly felt a feeling of joy and relief. My eyes got watery as I wide grin spread across my face when I saw him on the other side. He returned the smile and I nearly jumped on him on to hug him. He tightened the embrace and he ran his hands through my hair. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d I mumbled to him. We broke apart from the hug and he gave me a gentle kiss. He broke apart and I could see the sadness in his eyes. His eyes were puffy and red from crying. He pulled me into another tight embrace. It felt like he was holding on to me just to make sure I was actually here. </p><p>\u201cMy dad he-he\u2019s gone I saw him and then he just-he just turned to dust. Bernard he also he just he also turned to dust.\u201d He said his voice breaking into a sob. It broke my heart to hear him like this. I hugged him tighter. I felt tears myself go down my cheeks. He lost everything. He lost his family he doesn\u2019t have anyone else. And it broke my heart that I couldn\u2019t try harder to stop Thanos. I should\u2019ve tried harder. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I kept telling him. </p><p><i>I should\u2019ve tried harder</i>.</p><p>- </p><p>It\u2019s been a couple days after we returned back from Wakanda. I felt desperation , anxious, I felt tired and sadness. My dad was still gone in space along with Peter. Their hasn\u2019t been any sign of them. I tried and tried. I couldn\u2019t find a way to commiuncate with them. I would get barely any hours of sleep as I tried hard to get them back or at least talk to them. I had hope they were still out there that they were still alive. I needed to hang onto that hope or else I don\u2019t know what I would do. </p><p>\u201cHey kiddo.\u201d Even if I wasn\u2019t looking I knew who was talking. It was Steve. Lately he has been checking on me. He was trying to help me. I knew what he thought about my dad. But I couldn\u2019t let myself think that. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I said as I turned my head to see him leaning by the door. </p><p>\u201cBrought food Harry says you haven\u2019t ate yet.\u201d He then walks to where I\u2019m sitting and sets the plate down next to me. Lately I\u2019ve lacked on eating food. Finding barely any appetite for it. But the Steve, Natahsa, Pepper, Rhodey and Harry would always insist. Harry was staying at the compound with me. He didn\u2019t want to stay home alone so I brought him with me. I would often sleep at the compound. I felt like time would pass by quickly before I would know I would wake up in my old room. I hated leaving Pepper alone but I couldn\u2019t make it home. </p><p>I took a bite of the food just so Steve wouldn\u2019t say anything. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He asked as he took a seat next me. I looked back at the screen. </p><p>\u201cLooks like my dad had a suit built for me he just had it under his \u2018emergency\u2019 file. Just making a few adjustments for it to be good to go into space.\u201d  I told him while I took another bite of the food not tearing my eyes away from my work. He stayed quiet but I knew he was holding back on something he wanted to say. \u201cSpit out already I know you want to say something.\u201d I said to him. </p><p>\u201cAlexandria I know you love your dad and you want him back but what if he\u2019s gone like the others\u2014-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said \u201cwhat if\u201d I\u2019m holding on to that what if.\u201d I inturrpeted him. He sighed. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all trying hard to understand what Thanos did and how to get those that disappeared back&hellip;. if your dad was still out there don\u2019t you think he would\u2019ve communicated to us or came back?\u201d He asked. I knew he was trying to help me out and looking out for me but I still can\u2019t help but feel the anger rise inside me. </p><p>\u201cAnd what if he didn\u2019t disappear?\u201d I snapped at him. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s lost or stuck somewhere? Huh? I can\u2019t leave him out there.\u201d I felt my eyes sting from the angry tears that threatened to fall. I felt a breeze in the room, one that was once not here. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t lose yourself along the way&hellip;. if he\u2019s gone then you\u2019ll just get lost yourself trying to find him.\u201d I felt the breeze pick up and the anger I felt just increase. The ground was shaking and I could feel the fire in my fingerstips. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gone! Why are you convinced that he is!\u201d I yelled. The wind I was causing was getting worse it was sending lose papers all over the place and my hair rise. Dirt and rocks would hit the windows. The rain that was dropping lightly before now was harder and the droplets would hit the window too. I could feel the ground shake harder and the fire that was in my fingertips now increased and wrapped around my clenched fist. I was losing control I could feel it. I was losing control of my powers. </p><p>\u201cyou have to calm down Alexandria please.\u201d I could hear the panic in his voice and I could see his eyes shift from the window to me. Natasha and Carol a girl that came from space after we found a beeper that belonged to Nick fury beeped her to come to earth. She was helping us and staying here while she helped us out. They both rushed inside the room a worried expression on their faces. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gone.\u201d I sobbed while I fell on my knees. The window that I was causing outside broke the windows. The ground wasn\u2019t shaking anymore and the fire that was surrounding my fists was gone and the rain outside turned back to light rain. Steve didn\u2019t hesitate to fall next to me and hug me trying to comfort me. I hadn\u2019t let myself cry or feel anything after we got back I couldn\u2019t. </p><p><i>I know Tony is out there.

Made me feel even worse then I already felt. </p><p>The door was thrown open. I immediatly felt a feeling of joy and relief.

He tightened the embrace and he ran his hands through my hair. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d I mumbled to him. We broke apart from the hug and he gave me a gentle kiss.

He lost everything. He lost his family he doesn\u2019t have anyone else. And it broke my heart that I couldn\u2019t try harder to stop Thanos.

I felt desperation , anxious, I felt tired and sadness. My dad was still gone in space along with Peter. Their hasn\u2019t been any sign of them. I tried and tried. I couldn\u2019t find a way to commiuncate with them. I would get barely any hours of sleep as I tried hard to get them back or at least talk to them. I had hope they were still out there that they were still alive. I needed to hang onto that hope or else I don\u2019t know what I would do. </p><p>\u201cHey kiddo.\u201d Even if I wasn\u2019t looking I knew who was talking. It was Steve. Lately he has been checking on me. He was trying to help me. I knew what he thought about my dad. But I couldn\u2019t let myself think that. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I said as I turned my head to see him leaning by the door. </p><p>\u201cBrought food Harry says you haven\u2019t ate yet.\u201d He then walks to where I\u2019m sitting and sets the plate down next to me. Lately I\u2019ve lacked on eating food. Finding barely any appetite for it. But the Steve, Natahsa, Pepper, Rhodey and Harry would always insist. Harry was staying at the compound with me. He didn\u2019t want to stay home alone so I brought him with me. I would often sleep at the compound. I felt like time would pass by quickly before I would know I would wake up in my old room. I hated leaving Pepper alone but I couldn\u2019t make it home. </p><p>I took a bite of the food just so Steve wouldn\u2019t say anything. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He asked as he took a seat next me. I looked back at the screen. </p><p>\u201cLooks like my dad had a suit built for me he just had it under his \u2018emergency\u2019 file. Just making a few adjustments for it to be good to go into space.\u201d  I told him while I took another bite of the food not tearing my eyes away from my work. He stayed quiet but I knew he was holding back on something he wanted to say. \u201cSpit out already I know you want to say something.\u201d I said to him. </p><p>\u201cAlexandria I know you love your dad and you want him back but what if he\u2019s gone like the others\u2014-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said \u201cwhat if\u201d I\u2019m holding on to that what if.\u201d I inturrpeted him. He sighed. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all trying hard to understand what Thanos did and how to get those that disappeared back\u2026. if your dad was still out there don\u2019t you think he would\u2019ve communicated to us or came back?\u201d He asked. I knew he was trying to help me out and looking out for me but I still can\u2019t help but feel the anger rise inside me. </p><p>\u201cAnd what if he didn\u2019t disappear?\u201d I snapped at him. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s lost or stuck somewhere? Huh? I can\u2019t leave him out there.\u201d I felt my eyes sting from the angry tears that threatened to fall. I felt a breeze in the room, one that was once not here. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t lose yourself along the way\u2026. if he\u2019s gone then you\u2019ll just get lost yourself trying to find him.\u201d I felt the breeze pick up and the anger I felt just increase. The ground was shaking and I could feel the fire in my fingerstips. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gone! Why are you convinced that he is!\u201d I yelled. The wind I was causing was getting worse it was sending lose papers all over the place and my hair rise. Dirt and rocks would hit the windows. The rain that was dropping lightly before now was harder and the droplets would hit the window too. I could feel the ground shake harder and the fire that was in my fingertips now increased and wrapped around my clenched fist. I was losing control I could feel it. I was losing control of my powers. </p><p>\u201cyou have to calm down Alexandria please.\u201d I could hear the panic in his voice and I could see his eyes shift from the window to me. Natasha and Carol a girl that came from space after we found a beeper that belonged to Nick fury beeped her to come to earth. She was helping us and staying here while she helped us out. They both rushed inside the room a worried expression on their faces. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gone.\u201d I sobbed while I fell on my knees. The window that I was causing outside broke the windows. The ground wasn\u2019t shaking anymore and the fire that was surrounding my fists was gone and the rain outside turned back to light rain. Steve didn\u2019t hesitate to fall next to me and hug me trying to comfort me. I hadn\u2019t let myself cry or feel anything after we got back I couldn\u2019t. </p><p><i>I know Tony is out there.

I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to commiuncate with them. I would get barely any hours of sleep as I tried hard to get them back or at least talk to them. I had hope they were still out there that they were still alive. I needed to hang onto that hope or else I don&rsquo;t know what I would do. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kiddo.&rdquo; Even if I wasn&rsquo;t looking I knew who was talking. It was Steve. Lately he has been checking on me. He was trying to help me. I knew what he thought about my dad. But I couldn&rsquo;t let myself think that. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; I said as I turned my head to see him leaning by the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Brought food Harry says you haven&rsquo;t ate yet.&rdquo; He then walks to where I&rsquo;m sitting and sets the plate down next to me. Lately I&rsquo;ve lacked on eating food. Finding barely any appetite for it. But the Steve, Natahsa, Pepper, Rhodey and Harry would always insist. Harry was staying at the compound with me. He didn&rsquo;t want to stay home alone so I brought him with me. I would often sleep at the compound. I felt like time would pass by quickly before I would know I would wake up in my old room. I hated leaving Pepper alone but I couldn&rsquo;t make it home. </p><p>I took a bite of the food just so Steve wouldn&rsquo;t say anything. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; He asked as he took a seat next me. I looked back at the screen. </p><p>&ldquo;Looks like my dad had a suit built for me he just had it under his &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; file. Just making a few adjustments for it to be good to go into space.&rdquo;  I told him while I took another bite of the food not tearing my eyes away from my work. He stayed quiet but I knew he was holding back on something he wanted to say. &ldquo;Spit out already I know you want to say something.&rdquo; I said to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Alexandria I know you love your dad and you want him back but what if he&rsquo;s gone like the others&mdash;-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You said &ldquo;what if&rdquo; I&rsquo;m holding on to that what if.&rdquo; I inturrpeted him. He sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all trying hard to understand what Thanos did and how to get those that disappeared back&hellip;. if your dad was still out there don&rsquo;t you think he would&rsquo;ve communicated to us or came back?&rdquo; He asked. I knew he was trying to help me out and looking out for me but I still can&rsquo;t help but feel the anger rise inside me. </p><p>&ldquo;And what if he didn&rsquo;t disappear?&rdquo; I snapped at him. &ldquo;What if he&rsquo;s lost or stuck somewhere? Huh? I can&rsquo;t leave him out there.&rdquo; I felt my eyes sting from the angry tears that threatened to fall. I felt a breeze in the room, one that was once not here. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t lose yourself along the way&hellip;. if he&rsquo;s gone then you&rsquo;ll just get lost yourself trying to find him.&rdquo; I felt the breeze pick up and the anger I felt just increase. The ground was shaking and I could feel the fire in my fingerstips. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not gone! Why are you convinced that he is!&rdquo; I yelled. The wind I was causing was getting worse it was sending lose papers all over the place and my hair rise. Dirt and rocks would hit the windows. The rain that was dropping lightly before now was harder and the droplets would hit the window too. I could feel the ground shake harder and the fire that was in my fingertips now increased and wrapped around my clenched fist. I was losing control I could feel it. I was losing control of my powers. </p><p>&ldquo;you have to calm down Alexandria please.&rdquo; I could hear the panic in his voice and I could see his eyes shift from the window to me. Natasha and Carol a girl that came from space after we found a beeper that belonged to Nick fury beeped her to come to earth. She was helping us and staying here while she helped us out. They both rushed inside the room a worried expression on their faces. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not gone.&rdquo; I sobbed while I fell on my knees. The window that I was causing outside broke the windows. The ground wasn&rsquo;t shaking anymore and the fire that was surrounding my fists was gone and the rain outside turned back to light rain. Steve didn&rsquo;t hesitate to fall next to me and hug me trying to comfort me. I hadn&rsquo;t let myself cry or feel anything after we got back I couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p><i>I know Tony is out there. I know my dad is out there. And I&rsquo;m going to do whatever it takes to get him back.</i></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></p>",

I&hellip;was Tony\u2019s wife. I\u2019m here to talk to Peter and to formally invite the two of you to Tony\u2019s&hellip;um, Tony\u2019s funeral.\u201d Pepper stumbles on the last word, not wanting to bring light to the tragedy that plagued them not too long ago.</p><p>\t\u201cRight. Come on in, do you want some coffee?\u201d May gestures for Peter to open the door to let Pepper in.</p><p>\t\u201cThat would be great, thanks.\u201d Pepper sits down on the couch. Peter quietly sits across from her, playing with his fingers in his lap.</p><p>\t\u201cSo&hellip;is the funeral the only reason you came?\u201d He strains, trying to keep from crying again. He had shed so many tears on the man already, and he wanted to stay strong in front of his widowed wife.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, actually. I came here because you and Tony were very close. After the snap, he told me that you were the son he never had. He was truly devastated, and you were the main reason he tried to reverse the events of the snap. He wanted you back, Peter Parker. So, that being said&hellip;I needed to let you know that you have a sister.\u201d The corners of Pepper\u2019s mouth slightly turn up. Peter\u2019s head shoots up, shock covering his face.</p><p>\t\u201cI-I have a sister? Where is she&ndash; can I see her?\u201d He breathes out quickly, standing up and grabbing his coat. May walks in with three cups of coffee and sits down.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d May looks lost.</p><p>\t\u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, Ms. Parker, I\u2019d like to take Peter to the Avengers Compound to meet Tony and I\u2019s daughter.\u201d Pepper takes a cup of coffee and quickly downs the entire thing. She\u2019s quite tired, after all.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s absolutely fine. Tell me when you\u2019re on your way home, okay, Pete?\u201d May smiles and ruffles Peter\u2019s hair, setting the cup of coffee in his hand. He smiles widely and hugs May, thankful for everything she\u2019s done since he got back.</p><p>\t\u201cThank you.\u201d He whispers and lets go of her, running out of the door as Pepper follows behind.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d Pepper smiles and closes the door behind her.</p><p><br/></p><p>\tPulling up to the Avengers Compound, Peter is beyond jittery.</p><p>\t\u201cWill she like me?\u201d He asks suddenly, worry etching into his features.</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019ll love you, Peter. I know it.\u201d Pepper sets a calming hand onto his shoulder. He slowly calms down.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Happy turns around and gives the two of them a small smile.</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, Happy.\u201d Pepper and Peter say in unison. As soon as the car stops, Peter jumps out and runs to the door.</p><p>\t\u201cPeter!\u201d Shuri rushes to Peter and hugs him tightly.</p><p>\t\u201cShuri!\u201d Peter grins, hugging her back. The two teens pull away and give each other sad but reassuring smiles.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Shuri, do you know where Morgan is? Peter is here to see her.\u201d Pepper walks up to the two of them.</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s in the living room area, watching some TV.\u201d Shuri smiles and wishes the two well before walking back to her brother, punching him lightly in the arm.</p><p>\tPepper leads Peter to the living room area. He stops as soon as he sees the small figure on the couch looking up at a large TV screen. Pepper stops next to him, giving him a small glance.</p><p>\t\u201cMommy?\u201d Morgan turns around upon hearing the footsteps, seeing her mom and a random boy. She ducks behind the couch cushion when she sees Peter, only shyly peeking her eyes above the cushion after a few seconds.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Morgan. This is your big brother.\u201d Pepper introduces Peter to the young girl.</p><p>\t\u201cHi, I\u2019m Peter.\u201d He can\u2019t help but let a few tears roll down his cheeks as he smiles at her. She\u2019s a striking image of Tony.</p><p>\t\u201cHow come I didn\u2019t see you before?\u201d Morgan looks at Peter with skepticism and curiosity.</p><p>\t\u201cHe was one of the people that got erased before daddy defeated the bad guy. Remember, I told you about them?\u201d Pepper explains.</p><p>\t\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d Morgan nods her head slowly, coming up from behind the couch cushion fully.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to talk for a little bit.\u201d Pepper smiles and leaves the room. Peter slowly walks to the couch and sits down next to Morgan.</p><p>\t\u201cSo you\u2019re my big brother?\u201d She tilts her head to the side, eyes shining with intelligence.</p><p>\tShe\u2019s definitely Tony\u2019s daughter, Peter thinks.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, yeah I am.\u201d He smiles. In the blink of an eye, Morgan is hugging Peter tightly.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve never had a big brother before!\u201d She laughs, finally showing a smile. Peter smiles back, one of the first smiles he\u2019s shown that hasn\u2019t been out of sadness.</p><p>\t\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now.\u201d He ruffles her hair slightly as she pulls away from the hug.</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want to watch TV with me?\u201d She gasps, handing him the remote. He nods.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d He browses the channels with Morgan as the two continue to talk. And for once since Tony\u2019s death, he\u2019s found peace.</p><p><br/></p><p>\t\u201cPepper?\u201d Peter asks on the way back to his apartment.</p><p>\t\u201cYes?\u201d She hums, looking up from her screen to look Peter in the eyes. He glances down slightly to see that she was looking at an old photo of her, Tony, and Morgan together.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy did you introduce me to Morgan as her big brother when I\u2019m not?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause she just lost her father and she needs a big brother to look up to now. Plus, as she grows up she\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re not related by blood but by relation and it won\u2019t make a difference after she\u2019s grown up with you. plus&hellip;I was hoping that, if it\u2019s okay with May, the two of you could stay here, in the compound, with the rest of us? We could use Spider-Man around here.\u201d Pepper proposes, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\t\u201cIf May says yes, then I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Five years later</i></p><p><br/></p><p>\t\u201cPeter!\u201d Morgan launches herself onto her big brother. By this point, she knew he wasn\u2019t actually her big brother, but she didn\u2019t care. He pretty much was.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Morgan. Have you seen May?\u201d Peter laughs and twirls her around.</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s in her room. I set up heroes for us to play whenever you\u2019re ready, though.\u201d Morgan grins as Peter sets her down on the ground.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, of course, I\u2019ll be there in a second.\u201d Peter ruffles her hair and she runs to her room to wait to play with Peter.</p><p>\t\u201cPeter?\u201d May rounds the corner, a smile playing on her lips.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Aunt May.\u201d Peter hugs her.</p><p>\t\u201cHow was the mission?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGood. Tiring, but good. Shuri completely disoriented the guy by the time I could get him with my webs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back safe. Pepper is making dinner as a good job for the team, so I\u2019ll call you and Morgan down when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, May.\u201d Peter starts to walk toward Morgan\u2019s room.</p><p>\t\u201cOh, and Peter?\u201d May calls out. Peter turns around.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTony would be proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThank you.\u201d A soft smile appears on Peter\u2019s face.\u00a0Things are okay now, and they\u2019re going to stay okay as long as Peter has any say in it.</p>",

Peter slowly walks to the couch and sits down next to Morgan.</p><p>\t\u201cSo you\u2019re my big brother?\u201d She tilts her head to the side, eyes shining with intelligence.</p><p>\tShe\u2019s definitely Tony\u2019s daughter, Peter thinks.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, yeah I am.\u201d He smiles. In the blink of an eye, Morgan is hugging Peter tightly.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve never had a big brother before!\u201d She laughs, finally showing a smile. Peter smiles back, one of the first smiles he\u2019s shown that hasn\u2019t been out of sadness.</p><p>\t\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now.\u201d He ruffles her hair slightly as she pulls away from the hug.</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want to watch TV with me?\u201d She gasps, handing him the remote.

He glances down slightly to see that she was looking at an old photo of her, Tony, and Morgan together.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy did you introduce me to Morgan as her big brother when I\u2019m not?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause she just lost her father and she needs a big brother to look up to now. Plus, as she grows up she\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re not related by blood but by relation and it won\u2019t make a difference after she\u2019s grown up with you. plus\u2026I was hoping that, if it\u2019s okay with May, the two of you could stay here, in the compound, with the rest of us? We could use Spider-Man around here.\u201d Pepper proposes, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\t\u201cIf May says yes, then I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i>Five years later</i></p><p><br></p><p>\t\u201cPeter!\u201d Morgan launches herself onto her big brother. By this point, she knew he wasn\u2019t actually her big brother, but she didn\u2019t care. He pretty much was.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, Morgan. Have you seen May?\u201d Peter laughs and twirls her around.</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s in her room.

He had shed so many tears on the man already, and he wanted to stay strong in front of his widowed wife.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, actually. I came here because you and Tony were very close. After the snap, he told me that you were the son he never had. He was truly devastated, and you were the main reason he tried to reverse the events of the snap. He wanted you back, Peter Parker.

Tell me when you\u2019re on your way home, okay, Pete?\u201d May smiles and ruffles Peter\u2019s hair, setting the cup of coffee in his hand.

Tiring, but good. Shuri completely disoriented the guy by the time I could get him with my webs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re back safe. Pepper is making dinner as a good job for the team, so I&rsquo;ll call you and Morgan down when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Thanks, May.&rdquo; Peter starts to walk toward Morgan&rsquo;s room.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, and Peter?&rdquo; May calls out. Peter turns around.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tony would be proud of you.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; A soft smile appears on Peter&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;Things are okay now, and they&rsquo;re going to stay okay as long as Peter has any say in it.</p>",
