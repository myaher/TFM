So I won\u2019t add my voice to the mix in regards to what was included in the trailer, but I did want to discuss what wasn\u2019t included. </p><p>As expected, the trailer was tightly edited. We were given very little that wasn\u2019t set up the previous season and as many have already discussed, the trailer seems to focus on the first three episodes and the battle with the White Walkers. I know some people dismiss the importance of GOT trailers, but on the whole, they do tend to tell a cohesive story in relation to each season\u2019s narrative arc. Therefore, you can tell just as much by what is omitted from the trailer as to what is included, especially when the expected is missing.</p><p>So what was missing from the trailer that the audience expected to see, especially in light of S7?</p><h2><i>1. <b>Daenerys and her dragons missing from the White Walker battle.</b></i></h2><p>At the end of S7, Daenerys, her dragons and her army were heading North to \u201csave\u201d it from the approaching Army of the Dead. Jon (and the majority of the GA) is convinced that the dragons are key to defeating the Night King (while the dragons have the potential to be effective in thinning out the wights, the White Walkers are immune to fire). So like <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> asked, where is Daenerys? I expected a token shot of her riding Drogon, a dragon breathing fire and destroying wights - something that demonstrated her self-appointed role as saviour of the North. Instead, we have have Daenerys arriving at Winterfell, approaching Jon in the crypts, visiting her dragons and being very pretty and apprehensive in Winterfell. Which is an odd decision, because Daenerys role in defeating the Army of the Dead is taken as canon by some viewers, so a shot of her atop Drogon is not only expected, but it gives absolutely nothing away. So why isn\u2019t she there?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"274\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"snowsource:MBz67q_Tibeskzgw58JbiA:ZRfqQY2ggH1aw\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbb7d4dba230f1d51d41d848268a48e5/tumblr_pnwp9y2Dwi1xixo8uo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"274\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><i>2. <b>Where is Bran and Tyrion?</b></i></h2><p>Both Bran and Tyrion appear only once in the trailer. Bran in the first 30 seconds and Tyrion in the last 30 seconds. Considering their narrative importance, their omission from the battle with the White Walkers is pretty conspicuous. Bran has spent seven seasons preparing for this moment, and while many are placing their bets of Daenerys being the key to defeating the Night King, my money is on Bran. Therefore it makes sense to play down Bran\u2019s importance, only to blindside the audience with how Bran is integral in defeating the Night King.</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s absence from the battle is expected. He is Hand of the Queen and not expected to take up arms. But Tyrion is also absent (at least from the brief shots from the trailer) from where he is expected to be - either with Davos pacing the battlements or in the crypts with Varys. So why wasn\u2019t he shown? Is he no longer in Winterfell?</p><h2><i>3. <b>Where is Sansa?</b></i></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s absence from the battle is also expected, and while it could indicate absolutely nothing, I was surprised that Sansa wasn\u2019t shown waiting out the battle in the crypts with Varys (similar to her waiting out the siege of Kings Landing with Cersei in S2). Instead, they chose two shots of Sansa looking concerned - both of which followed (coincidentally I\u2019m sure) a Jon and Daenerys scene.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"bethnoel:2qw3MqQxH5UTN_l7CXqQQQ:ZSYFWd2ggKida\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f8fb87e69af5cb9e9f98d1ed960886a/tumblr_pnwrggtatP1wteim4o1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><i>4. <b>Oh Theon, where art thou?</b></i></h2><p>S7 ended with Theon on his way to rescue Yara from Euron\u2019s clutches. Therefore I think it\u2019s unlikely that he will play a part in the fight against the Army of the Dead and his absence isn\u2019t that odd. I tend to think that he\u2019ll play a bigger part in the second half of the season, so the question isn\u2019t why wasn\u2019t he featured, but what will role be after he succeeds/fails in rescuing Yara?</p>",

So I won\u2019t add my voice to the mix in regards to what was included in the trailer, but I did want to discuss what wasn\u2019t included. </p><p>As expected, the trailer was tightly edited. We were given very little that wasn\u2019t set up the previous season and as many have already discussed, the trailer seems to focus on the first three episodes and the battle with the White Walkers. I know some people dismiss the importance of GOT trailers, but on the whole, they do tend to tell a cohesive story in relation to each season\u2019s narrative arc. Therefore, you can tell just as much by what is omitted from the trailer as to what is included, especially when the expected is missing.</p><p>So what was missing from the trailer that the audience expected to see, especially in light of S7?</p><h2><i>1. <b>Daenerys and her dragons missing from the White Walker battle.</b></i></h2><p>At the end of S7, Daenerys, her dragons and her army were heading North to \u201csave\u201d it from the approaching Army of the Dead. Jon (and the majority of the GA) is convinced that the dragons are key to defeating the Night King (while the dragons have the potential to be effective in thinning out the wights, the White Walkers are immune to fire). So like <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> asked, where is Daenerys? I expected a token shot of her riding Drogon, a dragon breathing fire and destroying wights - something that demonstrated her self-appointed role as saviour of the North. Instead, we have have Daenerys arriving at Winterfell, approaching Jon in the crypts, visiting her dragons and being very pretty and apprehensive in Winterfell. Which is an odd decision, because Daenerys role in defeating the Army of the Dead is taken as canon by some viewers, so a shot of her atop Drogon is not only expected, but it gives absolutely nothing away. So why isn\u2019t she there?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"274\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"snowsource:MBz67q_Tibeskzgw58JbiA:ZRfqQY2ggH1aw\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbb7d4dba230f1d51d41d848268a48e5/tumblr_pnwp9y2Dwi1xixo8uo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"274\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><h2><i>2. <b>Where is Bran and Tyrion?</b></i></h2><p>Both Bran and Tyrion appear only once in the trailer.

Analyzing the sequencing, we can conclude that after the first part of the battle outside the walls of Winterfell, the characters will retreat on the ramparts/battlements and the courtyard - meaning Jaime, Pod and Brienne survive the first wave. Jorah and Greyworm on the other hand, the show clearly leaves their fates in the balance. </p><p>And for other characters - Sansa, Bran, Dany - however, the secret is still not out as to where they can be and what they will be doing during the battle. Begs the question whether that&rsquo;s deliberately not shown because they are involved in important stuff of their own&hellip; Sansa may not be involved in the fighting itself but she will definitely have been participating in the strategy of defense. Tyrion maybe as well. And Bran and Dany have their role to play against the Night King&hellip; </p></p>",
