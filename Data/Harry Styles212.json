        "body": "<p>So I\u2019m meeting Harry Styles for that first time. I\u2019m so excited, and I\u2019ll be more excited if I didn\u2019t feel like shit, waking up. When I woke up, my head\u2019s pounding,nose is a little bit droopy, and my throat hurts. And I really wanted to meet Harry and this is my chance. I\u2019m not letting that slipped. So I just go with it and took some medicine.</p><!-- more --><p>I go to the shower and of course, showered, what else am I going to do there. After like 30 minutes later, I go to my bedroom and wear a white T-shirt, that is a little big for me, a flannel that\u2019s tied to my waist, but I\u2019m gonna wear it, don\u2019t worry. And skinny jeans, and black vans. I know my fashion sense is weird but I don\u2019t really care.</p><p>My best friend, Y/BF/N, texted me saying that she\u2019s in front of my house waiting for me. She has a car, so we decided that we go together since she\u2019s going to his concert too.</p><p>\u201c<b>Are you excited??!!</b>\u201d She asked when she saw me, getting out of my house. When I got in front of her, I was giving my \u2018Really??? You\u2019re going to ask when you literally know the answer\u2019s\u2019 look. And she knows that look. I get really moody when I\u2019m sick but that\u2019s not an excuse for me to do that. But I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201c<b>Of course, I\u2019m excited. I got to see my husband</b>\u201d I exclaimed. I\u2019m a hazza since One Direction made. She\u2019s a nialler but she really like the type of music Harry\u2019s making. A indie,rock,19\u2019s,David Bowie type of music. But don\u2019t get me wrong, we love Niall\u2019s type of music too, that makes you dirty dancing.We got to the car and drive to our destination.</p><h2>*<b> An hour and few minutes leyter\u2026</b></h2><p>We are now in the concert\u2019s place and we are shocked when get there. There\u2019s no people waiting in long line,maybe we got here a little early.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Hey, I\u2019m just gonna buy some things in the store. Save some spot for me, please??</b>\u201d She smiled at me and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Of course, but are you okay?? You look paler than you actually used too</b>\u201d worrily. I just nodded and gave her a reassuring smile, not trusting my voice because my throat really hurts like hell. She smiled back at me, believing that I was okay. I actually can go with that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>But please make it faster. I don\u2019t like talking to other people by myself</b>\u201d I smiled at her and nodded and walk towards the pharmacy.</p><p>So there\u2019s no really much people here. So I bought the same pills that I had back at home and look at the description.</p><h2>*<i>But wait for another four hours before you took another pill again. If the symptoms persist, please consult your doctor\u2026..</i></h2><p>Shit. My head really hurts like shit. And I\u2019m gonna wait for four hours. Fuck no. But I just go with it since there\u2019s nothing really I can do about it and grab a large water bottle. I go to the counter and the workers there did their job.</p><p>So when I get outside, there\u2019s a really long line. And I see the person who\u2019s gonna check out ticket and I ran there as fast as I can.</p><p>Luckily, I caught up and we\u2019re the first ones who got inside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/BF/N, you go there to our assigned seats, I\u2019m gonna follow later</b>\u201d I\u2019m getting really dizzy and I also need to pee because I really drink so many water before we go here.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Hey, you alright?? I don\u2019t want to be annoying, but you really look like shit</b>\u201d she asked me worrily. \u201cI\u2019m fine, now go. Meet you later\u201d I didn\u2019t wait for her respond and find the restroom</p><p>So I quickly found the restroom, not looking at the signs, I go inside, and didn\u2019t even noticed the toilet bolted on the walls and other differences of a male\u2019s bathroom and female\u2019s bathroom. I got to the stalls and pee, after I got out, I got really dizzy, and before I knew it, I was puking my guts out.</p><p>I flushed the toilet (don\u2019t worry, I flushed the toilet after I peed), and get out and checked myself in the mirror. I grab my water and and drank it, not really swallowing it. I spit it so I can\u2019t taste the vomit in my mouth. When I put my head up, I\u2019m starting to realize that this is actually not the female\u2019s restroom. I quickly put my stuff on the bag, wanting to get out of this place before I get seen by someone. But I\u2019m very unlucky on this day.</p><p>I bumped into someone, not wanting to look at the face. But I need to, and start to apologizing. But when my head jerked up, It wasn\u2019t any man, but the one and only, HARRY STYLES IS IN FRONT OF ME!!!. I cannot get more dizzy when I hit my head into this man\u2019s chest, but just any man\u2019s, it was Harry\u2019s. My eyes got widened, really wanting to apologize but I can\u2019t because my throat hurts and the only thing I really wanted to do, is run. So I ran out of the bathroom, before he memorized my face and reported it to the guards.</p><p>I breathe heavily as I get into front rows, realizing that this is gonna be awkward since Harry is going to be literally in front of me, performing. This couldn\u2019t get any worse.</p><p>So longer than a few minutes later, the concert started and Harry jump into the scene and start performing. Luckily, he didn\u2019t see me there in front of him, he was on the other side. I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s looking for someone, here in the concert\u2026</p><h2>* <b>Couple hours leyter</b></h2><p>It\u2019s only just two hours after I took the pills, realizing that the pill didn\u2019t work, but I also didn\u2019t really want to drink the pills, not wanting to know what the side effects are ( ;) ). I just drank a plenty of water. After I did that, I\u2019m shocked when I saw that Harry\u2019s looking at me, smiling. Like I said, I\u2019m really moody when I\u2019m sick so I can\u2019t smile, I don\u2019t want to force it. So I just stand there, quietly, not doing anything, but enjoying the music that was getting performed.</p><p>A few minutes later, they\u2019re still performing, don\u2019t worry, they get a break before they started to perform. And while in the middle of performing, I saw Harry mocking me, standing like me while singing, of course. And looking at me, probably, when I don\u2019t feel like shit, I just a laugh and get embarrassed. But my head\u2019s really pounding, adding the vibration of the speakers. My eye rolled at the back of my head and before I knew it. I blacked out.</p><h2><b><i>Harry\u2019s POV</i></b></h2><p>So I saw the girl from the bathroom and decided to mock her a little. I was getting a little annoyed ( just to be clear though, Harry\u2019s not like this. I just did this for a little bit of\u2026.I don\u2019t know. Just deal with it) because she just stands there, just being quiet. So when she saw me, I copied the same way she was standing and look at her, but I keep singing, don\u2019t worry. But when I saw her eyes rolled back, I kinda felt regret and sad because I thought she was mad at me. But when she fell and luckily, her best friend was fast, yes, I can tell they were best friend, caught her.</p><p>I suddenly go to the guard and told them to get the girl who just faint brought it to room where I get ready call the emergency nurse. We came prepared always at this kind of case, but the only difference is I want to meet her and apologize so she\u2019s going to be on my room. I get back from performing, the audience was kind of confused at first, but when I get back from performing, they just continue to sing with me.</p><p>So after the performance, I call that a break. So I quickly go to the room and see her, lying on the couch, with the nurse beside her, putting a wet, cold yiwer on her forehead. The nurse were completely aware I was there and turn around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>So, she\u2019s okay now, she just got a high fever, so she need to take this pills every four hours. And drink plenty of water</b>.\u201d. I thanked the nurse and get out of here.</p><p>I go beside the girl, and I\u2019m gonna be honest, she\u2019s kinda.. pretty. Evey girl is pretty in their own ways, but I just can\u2019t help but get captured by her looks. Not completely aware, she\u2019s now waking up.</p><p>Y/N POV</p><p>Where am I?? Why am I on the couch?. I just feel that I\u2019m lying on the couch but I can still feel the vibrations of the sound and the music was playing. I opened my eyes and the first thing I saw, is a silhouette of a man looking at me. At first I didn\u2019t see it, but when my eyes adjusted from the light, I saw Harry\u2019s face staring at me. My face heat up, still embarrassed from the incident. I look from him and just stare in front of me. Still, my eyes widening, I remembered that I\u2019m with Y/BF/N so I quickly get up and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m fine now, I can go. My best friend\u2019s waiting for me, thanks for the help. By-</b>\u201d I quickly feel a hand grab my wrist and drag me back to the couch with him. He sat and put my between his arm. My face was close to his so I stared infront of me, again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Don\u2019t worry, your best friend will go here, she\u2019s allowed to. You rest before she got here, &lsquo;kay?</b>\u201d I just nodded, enjoying that I\u2019m between in his arms but not showing it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m sorry when I mocked you, I don\u2019t know how are you feeling then</b>\u201d he apologized.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>No, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t apologize, I should be the one who should be apologizing now. I\u2019m sorry for the &ldquo;bathroom</b>\u201d incident a while a ago. I didn\u2019t really realized that I was on male\u2019s bathroom&rdquo; I apologized back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>It\u2019s okay,babe. Maybe we should just start over again, what\u2019s your name?</b>\u201d He turn to me, making me turn to him too and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/N</b>\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What a unique name</b>\u201d he complemented. My face heat up, I can\u2019t register what\u2019s going on. I heard a running footsteps towards the room and the door quickly opened. Y/BF/N go towards me, I stand up and hug her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I was worried, why didn\u2019t you said that you have a high fever?</b>\u201d She pulled her self out from the hug and look at me with worried eyes.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cI just want to hang out with you today, we haven\u2019t much done together.</b>\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Oh shut up, we could\u2019ve just stay at your home and watch the live version</b>\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Do you want to go home? I mean, you need to go home so you could rest.</b>\u201d She added up, and she added again.</p><p>\u201c<b>We could just watch the live while driving you home, and when it\u2019s done, we could watch more of your husband\u2019s video, right, Harry?</b>\u201d She said sarcastically, looking serious at Harry.</p><p>Harry was shocked when he heard that. He didn\u2019t know he was the one who\u2019s talking about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>You have a husband?</b>\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Of course not,Y/BF/N was just messing aro-</b>\u201d I got cut off when Y/BF/N said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Her husband\u2019s name is Harry Edward Styles, she said it to herself when we driving here</b>\u201d. Maybe I looking like a tomato now, I hid my face on Y/BF/N\u2019s shoulders and couldn\u2019t help but smile. Still getting dizzy, Y/BF/N said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>But before that, Harry, can we a take a picture??</b>\u201d. Harry smiled\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Sure</b>\u201d. I take out my phone and take a picture of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Okay, Y/N go to your husband, now</b>\u201d Y/BF/N requested. Later, Y/BF/N. I go to the side of Harry and when Y/BF/N was about to pressed the button, Harry suddenly kissed my cheeks. OMAYGASHHHH!,WIIIEEEE!.</p><p>I thought this day was going to be a downhill since we didn\u2019t get VIP tickets, we couldn\u2019t afford it. Because we are contented to see Harry in front.</p><p>My eyes got widened, and the picture was taken. Y/BF/N look shocked too, but she only just smirked at me. I look at him with my widening eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What? I couldn\u2019t kiss my wife\u2019s cheek. It should\u2019ve been on the lips, ya know?</b>\u201d. I\u2019m getting dizzy, not only from my sick right now, but also from what was happening.</p><p>It was time to go and I really need to rest. So I kissed Harry\u2019s cheek too and ran to Y/BF/N, dragged her to the door and I said</p><p><b>\u201cBye, Harry</b>\u201d.</p><p>We are now getting out but I saw Niall.<br/><br/></p><p>\u201c<b>Y/BF/N want to lick your abs</b>\u201d at first, I thought that Niall\u2019s not gonna think that it was for him but Y/BF/N got embarrassed when we got a response saying\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Only if I have</b>\u201d. I just laughed and dragged Y/BF/N out if this place<br/></p><p>**********</p><p>Still cannot move one from what just happened, My best friend can\u2019t stop screaming and refreshing the memory over and over again. She just tweeted the picture too and she mentioned Harry, of course. She was waiting for a response but nothing, of course.</p><p>So while I was just gonna bring snack, I jump out when Y/BF/N screaming my name. I quickly grab the snacks and head to my bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What?</b>\u201d I ask. She look at with gleaming eyes\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>He responded, ask for your Twitter name, I just gave it right now</b>\u201d I heard a ding from my phone, we look at each other, as if we know the cue. I suddenly grab my phone form my desk and go to my bed with Y/BF/N.\u00a0</p><p>&rsquo;<i>Hey! So I saw your friend tweet and I ask for your Twitter name. I couldn\u2019t get your twitter name since you get out quickly and I was wondering if you could meet up with me</i>\u2019\u00a0</p><p>I look at Y/BF/N and her eyes is widening as I am and I look again at a another message\u00a0</p><p>&rsquo;<i>Were on a break before we are back to business. So I thought maybe I could spend my time with you. If you\u2019re okay with it</i>\u2019. So I reply\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &rsquo;<i>Of course, where to meet?</i>\u2019</p><p>He message me the place and asked for my number. Of course, I gave him my number. And after that, we say goodnight to him, same thing he did to me. And I was doing my happy dance on my bed\u2026</p><p><br/>\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d<br/>So that\u2019s it, that\u2019s my first imagine, first post here in tumblr.

I don\u2019t like talking to other people by myself</b>\u201d I smiled at her and nodded and walk towards the pharmacy.</p><p>So there\u2019s no really much people here. So I bought the same pills that I had back at home and look at the description.</p><h2>*<i>But wait for another four hours before you took another pill again. If the symptoms persist, please consult your doctor\u2026..</i></h2><p>Shit. My head really hurts like shit. And I\u2019m gonna wait for four hours. Fuck no. But I just go with it since there\u2019s nothing really I can do about it and grab a large water bottle. I go to the counter and the workers there did their job.</p><p>So when I get outside, there\u2019s a really long line. And I see the person who\u2019s gonna check out ticket and I ran there as fast as I can.</p><p>Luckily, I caught up and we\u2019re the first ones who got inside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/BF/N, you go there to our assigned seats, I\u2019m gonna follow later</b>\u201d I\u2019m getting really dizzy and I also need to pee because I really drink so many water before we go here.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Hey, you alright?? I don\u2019t want to be annoying, but you really look like shit</b>\u201d she asked me worrily. \u201cI\u2019m fine, now go. Meet you later\u201d I didn\u2019t wait for her respond and find the restroom</p><p>So I quickly found the restroom, not looking at the signs, I go inside, and didn\u2019t even noticed the toilet bolted on the walls and other differences of a male\u2019s bathroom and female\u2019s bathroom. I got to the stalls and pee, after I got out, I got really dizzy, and before I knew it, I was puking my guts out.</p><p>I flushed the toilet (don\u2019t worry, I flushed the toilet after I peed), and get out and checked myself in the mirror. I grab my water and and drank it, not really swallowing it. I spit it so I can\u2019t taste the vomit in my mouth. When I put my head up, I\u2019m starting to realize that this is actually not the female\u2019s restroom. I quickly put my stuff on the bag, wanting to get out of this place before I get seen by someone. But I\u2019m very unlucky on this day.</p><p>I bumped into someone, not wanting to look at the face. But I need to, and start to apologizing. But when my head jerked up, It wasn\u2019t any man, but the one and only, HARRY STYLES IS IN FRONT OF ME!!!. I cannot get more dizzy when I hit my head into this man\u2019s chest, but just any man\u2019s, it was Harry\u2019s. My eyes got widened, really wanting to apologize but I can\u2019t because my throat hurts and the only thing I really wanted to do, is run. So I ran out of the bathroom, before he memorized my face and reported it to the guards.</p><p>I breathe heavily as I get into front rows, realizing that this is gonna be awkward since Harry is going to be literally in front of me, performing. This couldn\u2019t get any worse.</p><p>So longer than a few minutes later, the concert started and Harry jump into the scene and start performing. Luckily, he didn\u2019t see me there in front of him, he was on the other side. I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s looking for someone, here in the concert\u2026</p><h2>* <b>Couple hours leyter</b></h2><p>It\u2019s only just two hours after I took the pills, realizing that the pill didn\u2019t work, but I also didn\u2019t really want to drink the pills, not wanting to know what the side effects are ( ;) ). I just drank a plenty of water. After I did that, I\u2019m shocked when I saw that Harry\u2019s looking at me, smiling. Like I said, I\u2019m really moody when I\u2019m sick so I can\u2019t smile, I don\u2019t want to force it. So I just stand there, quietly, not doing anything, but enjoying the music that was getting performed.</p><p>A few minutes later, they\u2019re still performing, don\u2019t worry, they get a break before they started to perform. And while in the middle of performing, I saw Harry mocking me, standing like me while singing, of course. And looking at me, probably, when I don\u2019t feel like shit, I just a laugh and get embarrassed. But my head\u2019s really pounding, adding the vibration of the speakers. My eye rolled at the back of my head and before I knew it. I blacked out.</p><h2><b><i>Harry\u2019s POV</i></b></h2><p>So I saw the girl from the bathroom and decided to mock her a little. I was getting a little annoyed ( just to be clear though, Harry\u2019s not like this. I just did this for a little bit of\u2026.I don\u2019t know. Just deal with it) because she just stands there, just being quiet. So when she saw me, I copied the same way she was standing and look at her, but I keep singing, don\u2019t worry. But when I saw her eyes rolled back, I kinda felt regret and sad because I thought she was mad at me. But when she fell and luckily, her best friend was fast, yes, I can tell they were best friend, caught her.</p><p>I suddenly go to the guard and told them to get the girl who just faint brought it to room where I get ready call the emergency nurse. We came prepared always at this kind of case, but the only difference is I want to meet her and apologize so she\u2019s going to be on my room. I get back from performing, the audience was kind of confused at first, but when I get back from performing, they just continue to sing with me.</p><p>So after the performance, I call that a break. So I quickly go to the room and see her, lying on the couch, with the nurse beside her, putting a wet, cold yiwer on her forehead. The nurse were completely aware I was there and turn around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>So, she\u2019s okay now, she just got a high fever, so she need to take this pills every four hours. And drink plenty of water</b>.\u201d. I thanked the nurse and get out of here.</p><p>I go beside the girl, and I\u2019m gonna be honest, she\u2019s kinda.. pretty. Evey girl is pretty in their own ways, but I just can\u2019t help but get captured by her looks. Not completely aware, she\u2019s now waking up.</p><p>Y/N POV</p><p>Where am I?? Why am I on the couch?. I just feel that I\u2019m lying on the couch but I can still feel the vibrations of the sound and the music was playing. I opened my eyes and the first thing I saw, is a silhouette of a man looking at me. At first I didn\u2019t see it, but when my eyes adjusted from the light, I saw Harry\u2019s face staring at me. My face heat up, still embarrassed from the incident. I look from him and just stare in front of me. Still, my eyes widening, I remembered that I\u2019m with Y/BF/N so I quickly get up and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m fine now, I can go. My best friend\u2019s waiting for me, thanks for the help. By-</b>\u201d I quickly feel a hand grab my wrist and drag me back to the couch with him. He sat and put my between his arm. My face was close to his so I stared infront of me, again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Don\u2019t worry, your best friend will go here, she\u2019s allowed to. You rest before she got here, \u2018kay?</b>\u201d I just nodded, enjoying that I\u2019m between in his arms but not showing it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m sorry when I mocked you, I don\u2019t know how are you feeling then</b>\u201d he apologized.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>No, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t apologize, I should be the one who should be apologizing now. I\u2019m sorry for the \u201cbathroom</b>\u201d incident a while a ago. I didn\u2019t really realized that I was on male\u2019s bathroom\u201d I apologized back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>It\u2019s okay,babe. Maybe we should just start over again, what\u2019s your name?</b>\u201d He turn to me, making me turn to him too and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/N</b>\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What a unique name</b>\u201d he complemented. My face heat up, I can\u2019t register what\u2019s going on. I heard a running footsteps towards the room and the door quickly opened. Y/BF/N go towards me, I stand up and hug her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I was worried, why didn\u2019t you said that you have a high fever?</b>\u201d She pulled her self out from the hug and look at me with worried eyes.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cI just want to hang out with you today, we haven\u2019t much done together.</b>\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Oh shut up, we could\u2019ve just stay at your home and watch the live version</b>\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Do you want to go home? I mean, you need to go home so you could rest.</b>\u201d She added up, and she added again.</p><p>\u201c<b>We could just watch the live while driving you home, and when it\u2019s done, we could watch more of your husband\u2019s video, right, Harry?</b>\u201d She said sarcastically, looking serious at Harry.</p><p>Harry was shocked when he heard that. He didn\u2019t know he was the one who\u2019s talking about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>You have a husband?</b>\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Of course not,Y/BF/N was just messing aro-</b>\u201d I got cut off when Y/BF/N said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Her husband\u2019s name is Harry Edward Styles, she said it to herself when we driving here</b>\u201d. Maybe I looking like a tomato now, I hid my face on Y/BF/N\u2019s shoulders and couldn\u2019t help but smile. Still getting dizzy, Y/BF/N said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>But before that, Harry, can we a take a picture??</b>\u201d. Harry smiled\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Sure</b>\u201d. I take out my phone and take a picture of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Okay, Y/N go to your husband, now</b>\u201d Y/BF/N requested. Later, Y/BF/N. I go to the side of Harry and when Y/BF/N was about to pressed the button, Harry suddenly kissed my cheeks. OMAYGASHHHH!,WIIIEEEE!.</p><p>I thought this day was going to be a downhill since we didn\u2019t get VIP tickets, we couldn\u2019t afford it. Because we are contented to see Harry in front.</p><p>My eyes got widened, and the picture was taken. Y/BF/N look shocked too, but she only just smirked at me. I look at him with my widening eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What? I couldn\u2019t kiss my wife\u2019s cheek. It should\u2019ve been on the lips, ya know?</b>\u201d. I\u2019m getting dizzy, not only from my sick right now, but also from what was happening.</p><p>It was time to go and I really need to rest. So I kissed Harry\u2019s cheek too and ran to Y/BF/N, dragged her to the door and I said</p><p><b>\u201cBye, Harry</b>\u201d.</p><p>We are now getting out but I saw Niall.<br><br></p><p>\u201c<b>Y/BF/N want to lick your abs</b>\u201d at first, I thought that Niall\u2019s not gonna think that it was for him but Y/BF/N got embarrassed when we got a response saying\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Only if I have</b>\u201d. I just laughed and dragged Y/BF/N out if this place<br></p><p>**********</p><p>Still cannot move one from what just happened, My best friend can\u2019t stop screaming and refreshing the memory over and over again. She just tweeted the picture too and she mentioned Harry, of course. She was waiting for a response but nothing, of course.</p><p>So while I was just gonna bring snack, I jump out when Y/BF/N screaming my name. I quickly grab the snacks and head to my bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What?</b>\u201d I ask. She look at with gleaming eyes\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>He responded, ask for your Twitter name, I just gave it right now</b>\u201d I heard a ding from my phone, we look at each other, as if we know the cue. I suddenly grab my phone form my desk and go to my bed with Y/BF/N.\u00a0</p><p>\u2019<i>Hey! So I saw your friend tweet and I ask for your Twitter name. I couldn\u2019t get your twitter name since you get out quickly and I was wondering if you could meet up with me</i>\u2019\u00a0</p><p>I look at Y/BF/N and her eyes is widening as I am and I look again at a another message\u00a0</p><p>\u2019<i>Were on a break before we are back to business. So I thought maybe I could spend my time with you. If you\u2019re okay with it</i>\u2019. So I reply\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2019<i>Of course, where to meet?</i>\u2019</p><p>He message me the place and asked for my number. Of course, I gave him my number. And after that, we say goodnight to him, same thing he did to me. And I was doing my happy dance on my bed\u2026</p><p><br>\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201c\u201d<br>So that\u2019s it, that\u2019s my first imagine, first post here in tumblr.

When I woke up, my head\u2019s pounding,nose is a little bit droopy, and my throat hurts. And I really wanted to meet Harry and this is my chance. I\u2019m not letting that slipped. So I just go with it and took some medicine.</p>[[MORE]]<p>I go to the shower and of course, showered, what else am I going to do there. After like 30 minutes later, I go to my bedroom and wear a white T-shirt, that is a little big for me, a flannel that\u2019s tied to my waist, but I\u2019m gonna wear it, don\u2019t worry. And skinny jeans, and black vans. I know my fashion sense is weird but I don\u2019t really care.</p><p>My best friend, Y/BF/N, texted me saying that she\u2019s in front of my house waiting for me. She has a car, so we decided that we go together since she\u2019s going to his concert too.</p><p>\u201c<b>Are you excited??!!</b>\u201d She asked when she saw me, getting out of my house. When I got in front of her, I was giving my \u2018Really??? You\u2019re going to ask when you literally know the answer\u2019s\u2019 look. And she knows that look. I get really moody when I\u2019m sick but that\u2019s not an excuse for me to do that. But I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201c<b>Of course, I\u2019m excited. I got to see my husband</b>\u201d I exclaimed. I\u2019m a hazza since One Direction made. She\u2019s a nialler but she really like the type of music Harry\u2019s making. A indie,rock,19\u2019s,David Bowie type of music. But don\u2019t get me wrong, we love Niall\u2019s type of music too, that makes you dirty dancing.We got to the car and drive to our destination.</p><h2>*<b> An hour and few minutes leyter\u2026</b></h2><p>We are now in the concert\u2019s place and we are shocked when get there. There\u2019s no people waiting in long line,maybe we got here a little early.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Hey, I\u2019m just gonna buy some things in the store. Save some spot for me, please??</b>\u201d She smiled at me and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Of course, but are you okay?? You look paler than you actually used too</b>\u201d worrily. I just nodded and gave her a reassuring smile, not trusting my voice because my throat really hurts like hell. She smiled back at me, believing that I was okay. I actually can go with that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>But please make it faster. I don\u2019t like talking to other people by myself</b>\u201d I smiled at her and nodded and walk towards the pharmacy.</p><p>So there\u2019s no really much people here. So I bought the same pills that I had back at home and look at the description.</p><h2>*<i>But wait for another four hours before you took another pill again. If the symptoms persist, please consult your doctor\u2026..</i></h2><p>Shit. My head really hurts like shit. And I\u2019m gonna wait for four hours. Fuck no. But I just go with it since there\u2019s nothing really I can do about it and grab a large water bottle. I go to the counter and the workers there did their job.</p><p>So when I get outside, there\u2019s a really long line. And I see the person who\u2019s gonna check out ticket and I ran there as fast as I can.</p><p>Luckily, I caught up and we\u2019re the first ones who got inside.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/BF/N, you go there to our assigned seats, I\u2019m gonna follow later</b>\u201d I\u2019m getting really dizzy and I also need to pee because I really drink so many water before we go here.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Hey, you alright?? I don\u2019t want to be annoying, but you really look like shit</b>\u201d she asked me worrily. \u201cI\u2019m fine, now go. Meet you later\u201d I didn\u2019t wait for her respond and find the restroom</p><p>So I quickly found the restroom, not looking at the signs, I go inside, and didn\u2019t even noticed the toilet bolted on the walls and other differences of a male\u2019s bathroom and female\u2019s bathroom. I got to the stalls and pee, after I got out, I got really dizzy, and before I knew it, I was puking my guts out.</p><p>I flushed the toilet (don\u2019t worry, I flushed the toilet after I peed), and get out and checked myself in the mirror. I grab my water and and drank it, not really swallowing it. I spit it so I can\u2019t taste the vomit in my mouth. When I put my head up, I\u2019m starting to realize that this is actually not the female\u2019s restroom. I quickly put my stuff on the bag, wanting to get out of this place before I get seen by someone. But I\u2019m very unlucky on this day.</p><p>I bumped into someone, not wanting to look at the face. But I need to, and start to apologizing. But when my head jerked up, It wasn\u2019t any man, but the one and only, HARRY STYLES IS IN FRONT OF ME!!!. I cannot get more dizzy when I hit my head into this man\u2019s chest, but just any man\u2019s, it was Harry\u2019s. My eyes got widened, really wanting to apologize but I can\u2019t because my throat hurts and the only thing I really wanted to do, is run. So I ran out of the bathroom, before he memorized my face and reported it to the guards.</p><p>I breathe heavily as I get into front rows, realizing that this is gonna be awkward since Harry is going to be literally in front of me, performing. This couldn\u2019t get any worse.</p><p>So longer than a few minutes later, the concert started and Harry jump into the scene and start performing. Luckily, he didn\u2019t see me there in front of him, he was on the other side. I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s looking for someone, here in the concert\u2026</p><h2>* <b>Couple hours leyter</b></h2><p>It\u2019s only just two hours after I took the pills, realizing that the pill didn\u2019t work, but I also didn\u2019t really want to drink the pills, not wanting to know what the side effects are ( ;) ). I just drank a plenty of water. After I did that, I\u2019m shocked when I saw that Harry\u2019s looking at me, smiling. Like I said, I\u2019m really moody when I\u2019m sick so I can\u2019t smile, I don\u2019t want to force it. So I just stand there, quietly, not doing anything, but enjoying the music that was getting performed.</p><p>A few minutes later, they\u2019re still performing, don\u2019t worry, they get a break before they started to perform. And while in the middle of performing, I saw Harry mocking me, standing like me while singing, of course. And looking at me, probably, when I don\u2019t feel like shit, I just a laugh and get embarrassed. But my head\u2019s really pounding, adding the vibration of the speakers. My eye rolled at the back of my head and before I knew it. I blacked out.</p><h2><b><i>Harry\u2019s POV</i></b></h2><p>So I saw the girl from the bathroom and decided to mock her a little. I was getting a little annoyed ( just to be clear though, Harry\u2019s not like this. I just did this for a little bit of\u2026.I don\u2019t know. Just deal with it) because she just stands there, just being quiet. So when she saw me, I copied the same way she was standing and look at her, but I keep singing, don\u2019t worry. But when I saw her eyes rolled back, I kinda felt regret and sad because I thought she was mad at me. But when she fell and luckily, her best friend was fast, yes, I can tell they were best friend, caught her.</p><p>I suddenly go to the guard and told them to get the girl who just faint brought it to room where I get ready call the emergency nurse. We came prepared always at this kind of case, but the only difference is I want to meet her and apologize so she\u2019s going to be on my room. I get back from performing, the audience was kind of confused at first, but when I get back from performing, they just continue to sing with me.</p><p>So after the performance, I call that a break. So I quickly go to the room and see her, lying on the couch, with the nurse beside her, putting a wet, cold yiwer on her forehead. The nurse were completely aware I was there and turn around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>So, she\u2019s okay now, she just got a high fever, so she need to take this pills every four hours. And drink plenty of water</b>.\u201d. I thanked the nurse and get out of here.</p><p>I go beside the girl, and I\u2019m gonna be honest, she\u2019s kinda.. pretty. Evey girl is pretty in their own ways, but I just can\u2019t help but get captured by her looks. Not completely aware, she\u2019s now waking up.</p><p>Y/N POV</p><p>Where am I?? Why am I on the couch?. I just feel that I\u2019m lying on the couch but I can still feel the vibrations of the sound and the music was playing. I opened my eyes and the first thing I saw, is a silhouette of a man looking at me. At first I didn\u2019t see it, but when my eyes adjusted from the light, I saw Harry\u2019s face staring at me. My face heat up, still embarrassed from the incident. I look from him and just stare in front of me. Still, my eyes widening, I remembered that I\u2019m with Y/BF/N so I quickly get up and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m fine now, I can go. My best friend\u2019s waiting for me, thanks for the help. By-</b>\u201d I quickly feel a hand grab my wrist and drag me back to the couch with him. He sat and put my between his arm. My face was close to his so I stared infront of me, again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Don\u2019t worry, your best friend will go here, she\u2019s allowed to. You rest before she got here, \u2018kay?</b>\u201d I just nodded, enjoying that I\u2019m between in his arms but not showing it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I\u2019m sorry when I mocked you, I don\u2019t know how are you feeling then</b>\u201d he apologized.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>No, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t apologize, I should be the one who should be apologizing now. I\u2019m sorry for the \u201cbathroom</b>\u201d incident a while a ago. I didn\u2019t really realized that I was on male\u2019s bathroom\u201d I apologized back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>It\u2019s okay,babe. Maybe we should just start over again, what\u2019s your name?</b>\u201d He turn to me, making me turn to him too and said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Y/N</b>\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What a unique name</b>\u201d he complemented. My face heat up, I can\u2019t register what\u2019s going on. I heard a running footsteps towards the room and the door quickly opened. Y/BF/N go towards me, I stand up and hug her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>I was worried, why didn\u2019t you said that you have a high fever?</b>\u201d She pulled her self out from the hug and look at me with worried eyes.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cI just want to hang out with you today, we haven\u2019t much done together.</b>\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Oh shut up, we could\u2019ve just stay at your home and watch the live version</b>\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Do you want to go home? I mean, you need to go home so you could rest.</b>\u201d She added up, and she added again.</p><p>\u201c<b>We could just watch the live while driving you home, and when it\u2019s done, we could watch more of your husband\u2019s video, right, Harry?</b>\u201d She said sarcastically, looking serious at Harry.</p><p>Harry was shocked when he heard that. He didn\u2019t know he was the one who\u2019s talking about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>You have a husband?</b>\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Of course not,Y/BF/N was just messing aro-</b>\u201d I got cut off when Y/BF/N said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Her husband\u2019s name is Harry Edward Styles, she said it to herself when we driving here</b>\u201d. Maybe I looking like a tomato now, I hid my face on Y/BF/N\u2019s shoulders and couldn\u2019t help but smile. Still getting dizzy, Y/BF/N said\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>But before that, Harry, can we a take a picture??</b>\u201d. Harry smiled\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Sure</b>\u201d. I take out my phone and take a picture of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Okay, Y/N go to your husband, now</b>\u201d Y/BF/N requested. Later, Y/BF/N. I go to the side of Harry and when Y/BF/N was about to pressed the button, Harry suddenly kissed my cheeks. OMAYGASHHHH!,WIIIEEEE!.</p><p>I thought this day was going to be a downhill since we didn\u2019t get VIP tickets, we couldn\u2019t afford it. Because we are contented to see Harry in front.</p><p>My eyes got widened, and the picture was taken. Y/BF/N look shocked too, but she only just smirked at me. I look at him with my widening eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What? I couldn\u2019t kiss my wife\u2019s cheek. It should\u2019ve been on the lips, ya know?</b>\u201d. I\u2019m getting dizzy, not only from my sick right now, but also from what was happening.</p><p>It was time to go and I really need to rest. So I kissed Harry\u2019s cheek too and ran to Y/BF/N, dragged her to the door and I said</p><p><b>\u201cBye, Harry</b>\u201d.</p><p>We are now getting out but I saw Niall.<br><br></p><p>\u201c<b>Y/BF/N want to lick your abs</b>\u201d at first, I thought that Niall\u2019s not gonna think that it was for him but Y/BF/N got embarrassed when we got a response saying\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Only if I have</b>\u201d. I just laughed and dragged Y/BF/N out if this place<br></p><p>**********</p><p>Still cannot move one from what just happened, My best friend can\u2019t stop screaming and refreshing the memory over and over again. She just tweeted the picture too and she mentioned Harry, of course. She was waiting for a response but nothing, of course.</p><p>So while I was just gonna bring snack, I jump out when Y/BF/N screaming my name. I quickly grab the snacks and head to my bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>What?</b>\u201d I ask. She look at with gleaming eyes\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>He responded, ask for your Twitter name, I just gave it right now</b>\u201d I heard a ding from my phone, we look at each other, as if we know the cue. I suddenly grab my phone form my desk and go to my bed with Y/BF/N.\u00a0</p><p>\u2019<i>Hey! So I saw your friend tweet and I ask for your Twitter name.

                "content": "<p>So I&rsquo;m meeting Harry Styles for that first time. I&rsquo;m so excited, and I&rsquo;ll be more excited if I didn&rsquo;t feel like shit, waking up. When I woke up, my head&rsquo;s pounding,nose is a little bit droopy, and my throat hurts. And I really wanted to meet Harry and this is my chance. I&rsquo;m not letting that slipped. So I just go with it and took some medicine.</p><p>I go to the shower and of course, showered, what else am I going to do there. After like 30 minutes later, I go to my bedroom and wear a white T-shirt, that is a little big for me, a flannel that&rsquo;s tied to my waist, but I&rsquo;m gonna wear it, don&rsquo;t worry. And skinny jeans, and black vans. I know my fashion sense is weird but I don&rsquo;t really care.</p><p>My best friend, Y/BF/N, texted me saying that she&rsquo;s in front of my house waiting for me. She has a car, so we decided that we go together since she&rsquo;s going to his concert too.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Are you excited??!!</b>&rdquo; She asked when she saw me, getting out of my house. When I got in front of her, I was giving my &lsquo;Really??? You&rsquo;re going to ask when you literally know the answer&rsquo;s&rsquo; look. And she knows that look. I get really moody when I&rsquo;m sick but that&rsquo;s not an excuse for me to do that. But I can&rsquo;t help it.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Of course, I&rsquo;m excited. I got to see my husband</b>&rdquo; I exclaimed. I&rsquo;m a hazza since One Direction made. She&rsquo;s a nialler but she really like the type of music Harry&rsquo;s making. A indie,rock,19&rsquo;s,David Bowie type of music. But don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we love Niall&rsquo;s type of music too, that makes you dirty dancing.We got to the car and drive to our destination.</p><h2>*<b> An hour and few minutes leyter&hellip;</b></h2><p>We are now in the concert&rsquo;s place and we are shocked when get there. There&rsquo;s no people waiting in long line,maybe we got here a little early.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Hey, I&rsquo;m just gonna buy some things in the store. Save some spot for me, please??</b>&rdquo; She smiled at me and said&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Of course, but are you okay?? You look paler than you actually used too</b>&rdquo; worrily. I just nodded and gave her a reassuring smile, not trusting my voice because my throat really hurts like hell. She smiled back at me, believing that I was okay. I actually can go with that.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>But please make it faster. I don&rsquo;t like talking to other people by myself</b>&rdquo; I smiled at her and nodded and walk towards the pharmacy.</p><p>So there&rsquo;s no really much people here. So I bought the same pills that I had back at home and look at the description.</p><h2>*<i>But wait for another four hours before you took another pill again. If the symptoms persist, please consult your doctor&hellip;..</i></h2><p>Shit. My head really hurts like shit. And I&rsquo;m gonna wait for four hours. Fuck no. But I just go with it since there&rsquo;s nothing really I can do about it and grab a large water bottle. I go to the counter and the workers there did their job.</p><p>So when I get outside, there&rsquo;s a really long line. And I see the person who&rsquo;s gonna check out ticket and I ran there as fast as I can.</p><p>Luckily, I caught up and we&rsquo;re the first ones who got inside.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Y/BF/N, you go there to our assigned seats, I&rsquo;m gonna follow later</b>&rdquo; I&rsquo;m getting really dizzy and I also need to pee because I really drink so many water before we go here.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Hey, you alright?? I don&rsquo;t want to be annoying, but you really look like shit</b>&rdquo; she asked me worrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, now go. Meet you later&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t wait for her respond and find the restroom</p><p>So I quickly found the restroom, not looking at the signs, I go inside, and didn&rsquo;t even noticed the toilet bolted on the walls and other differences of a male&rsquo;s bathroom and female&rsquo;s bathroom. I got to the stalls and pee, after I got out, I got really dizzy, and before I knew it, I was puking my guts out.</p><p>I flushed the toilet (don&rsquo;t worry, I flushed the toilet after I peed), and get out and checked myself in the mirror. I grab my water and and drank it, not really swallowing it. I spit it so I can&rsquo;t taste the vomit in my mouth. When I put my head up, I&rsquo;m starting to realize that this is actually not the female&rsquo;s restroom. I quickly put my stuff on the bag, wanting to get out of this place before I get seen by someone. But I&rsquo;m very unlucky on this day.</p><p>I bumped into someone, not wanting to look at the face. But I need to, and start to apologizing. But when my head jerked up, It wasn&rsquo;t any man, but the one and only, HARRY STYLES IS IN FRONT OF ME!!!. I cannot get more dizzy when I hit my head into this man&rsquo;s chest, but just any man&rsquo;s, it was Harry&rsquo;s. My eyes got widened, really wanting to apologize but I can&rsquo;t because my throat hurts and the only thing I really wanted to do, is run. So I ran out of the bathroom, before he memorized my face and reported it to the guards.</p><p>I breathe heavily as I get into front rows, realizing that this is gonna be awkward since Harry is going to be literally in front of me, performing. This couldn&rsquo;t get any worse.</p><p>So longer than a few minutes later, the concert started and Harry jump into the scene and start performing. Luckily, he didn&rsquo;t see me there in front of him, he was on the other side. I&rsquo;m thinking he&rsquo;s looking for someone, here in the concert&hellip;</p><h2>* <b>Couple hours leyter</b></h2><p>It&rsquo;s only just two hours after I took the pills, realizing that the pill didn&rsquo;t work, but I also didn&rsquo;t really want to drink the pills, not wanting to know what the side effects are ( ;) ).
