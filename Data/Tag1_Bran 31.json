Howard wasn&rsquo;t the creator of this fantasy sub-genre. Like Lovecraft, he recognized that he was standing on the shoulders of geniuses and acknolwedged their contribution to his preferred medium and their influences which largely consisted of religious folklore and ancient history. He used an archaic style that echoed his Victorian predecessors. But here is where the similarities stop. Unlike Lovecraft who followed their Victorian predecessors&rsquo; line of reasoning more closely, Robert E. Howard chose to be a rebel even within their own circles by challenging the usual fantasy tropes. Like Lovecraft, he had a tough life and just as with every fiction writer, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to disassociate his writing from his personal experiences.*</p><p>Towards the end of his life, Robert E. Howard took a grim view of the world that echoed H.P. Lovecraft but unlike his fellow writer whose stories also became bleaker, Howard&rsquo;s remained just as violent with a pinch of hope added to them. Conan the Cimmerian or Conan the Barbarian (as modern audiences know him by) never falls into despair. When he comes face to face with the cosmic horrors that stalk the universe, he uses their logic against them. The same goes with Howard&rsquo;s first war lord creation, Kull. In an introduction to &ldquo;Kull: Exile of Atlantis&rdquo;, a modern author calls Kull the &ldquo;barbarian&rsquo;s scholar&rdquo; and the &ldquo;scholars&rsquo; barbarian.&rdquo; He is a little bit of both, much like his later creation set during the Stuart Era, Solomon Kane. His view of the world is shaped by his experiences. Unaware that he is meant for something greater, he goes on various quests until he fully embraces the responsibilities that have been thrust upon him by fate. Rather than becoming fate&rsquo;s puppet like George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s characters from A Song of Ice and Fire and the spin off novellas set in the same world, he still lives by his own rules. </p><p>It basically bottles down to &ldquo;my way or the highway.

A Supreme Being/Savior?</b></p><p>Some have compared Bran to the supreme being/chosen one from the Dune novels. But is it a valid comparison?</p><p>No.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s why: Whereas Leto and his father (the first KH) can see multiple futures and have lived multiple lives due to them unlocking the memories of ALL of their ancestors; they don&rsquo;t just sit around waiting for their desired outcome to become a reality. There&rsquo;s a lot of manipulation and deception on their part but this is done with them at the forefront instead of working behind the shadows to avoid danger.</p><p>Also, the future, as it is often shown, isn&rsquo;t fixed; meaning that each choice we make leads to different outcomes which forces our protagonists to work harder to get their desired outcome. By contrast in Game of Thrones -and I suspect in the novels as well given Robert A. Heinlein&rsquo;s influence on GRRM on this subject- time is a fixed point. You can&rsquo;t undo the past nor change the future. Free will is an illusion. The ending of #GameofThrones also leaves you with the idea that maybe, just maybe, Bran is the greatest villain in all the history of Westeros. He tells Meera he&rsquo;s not Bran anymore but then he goes back to embracing that identity after he&rsquo;s named King. He tells Tyrion that&rsquo;s the sole reason why he accompanied his sisters to Westeros, to be King. </p><p>The consciousness of the old gods of nature revered by the (COTF) children of the Forest, live within him. He&rsquo;s the COTF revenge. But unlike the myriad of possibilities undone by the unpredictable nature of mankind in Dune, the future is set in this saga. Thus, dooming mankind to an eternity of subservience under this all-knowing nature vessel. </p><p>Furthermore, even with all the transference of consciousness that also occurs in Dune with the 2 KH, they don&rsquo;t lose all of their humanity. Leto II becomes the God Emperor and goes on to rule the Known Universe for thousands of years but in spite of his new condition and super powers, he still feels. Unlike what was implied by the GOT ending, Paul and Leto&rsquo;s objective when launching their Jihad wasn&rsquo;t to take over all living things to aid the greedy Bene Gesserit (who were the initial movers and shakes behind their creation, much like the COTF with Bran and previous three-eyed-ravens); rather, it was to help humankind reach their true potential.</p><p>*It&rsquo;s no secret that GRRM is a big science fiction buff. Most of his books are science fiction and one of his biggest influences from this genre is Robert A. Heinlein. For those of you who are new to his works; I&rsquo;ll keep it short. Heinlein has written many works where he deals with the issue of time and free will. Characters who find out about their destiny or are offered the chance to escape whatever time loop they&rsquo;re stuck on, find out they can&rsquo;t because once they know their destiny, it can only mean that their future is set and will happen regardless of how much they fight against it.</p>",

For the Fisher King (or King Arthur, who GRRM has compared Bran to), who draws his powers from the Holy Grail, the Starks\u2019 are centred around the heart tree, around Winterfell. \n\n</p><p><i>\u201cThe Stark in Winterfell\u201d is ASOIAF\u2019s incarnation of the Fisher King, a legendary figure from English and Welsh mythology who is spiritually and physically tied to the land, and whose fortunes, good and ill, are mirrored in the realm.

The role of \u201cThe Stark in Winterfell\u201d is meant to be as its creator Brandon the Builder was, a fusion of apparent opposites: man and god, king and greenseer, and the monolith that is his seat is both castle and tree, a \u201cmonstrous stone tree.\u201d</i></p>\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just any Stark - <i>the</i> Stark in Winterfell is a title interchangeable with the one that rules it:\n\n\u201c<b>The Stark in Winterfell</b> wanted Bael\u2019s head\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c<b>The Stark in Winterfell</b> had to take a hand [in-stopping the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019s rebellion]\n-Jon, ASOS\n\nAnd then you\u2019ve got Bran, who\u2019s repeatedly referred as such. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m the Prince.

But as Bran the Builder built Winterfell from its stone and drew power from its heart tree, so will Bran as the heir to the winter throne. \n\nWhich is something to remember, btw. The show chose not to emphasize the fact Bran is very aware of his responsibility as Robb\u2019s heir and it\u2019s something the Reeds are always careful to remind him of:\n\n\nI\u2019m <b> the Prince of the North</b>, and a warg too.-(Bran, ASOS)\n\n\u201cYou are <b>our prince as well, our lord\u2019s son, and our king\u2019s true heir</b>.\u201d -(Meera Reed to Bran, ASOS)\n\nJojen gazed up at him with his dark green eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here to hurt us, <b>Your Grace</b>.\u201d-(Bran, ASOS)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s <b>our prince</b>.\u201d-(Meera to Samwell Tarly, ASOS)\n\n\u201cBy night all cloaks are black, <b>Your Grace</b>.\u201d-(Jojen to Bran, ASOS)\n\nEvery Stark except Bran has other people manipulating their names to claim the Northern throne. Baelish wants to see Sansa as Queen, the Northern Lords are rallying behind Rickon, and Arya\u2019s name was used by the Boltons to consolidate their rule over Winterfell. What\u2019s fascinating is that the true heir to the North, the only one out of the four surviving trueborn Starks to ever rule Winterfell, is the one who\u2019s excluded from this game of thrones and far in the lands the Starks originated from, deep in Winter and learning the magic rooted in Stark ancestry - warging, the Old Gods, and the powers of the weirwood trees. Bran embodies the North and House Stark, it\u2019s only fitting that he should be the one to rule it in the end. \n\nAlso regardless of the show, the North is patriarchal af and would never support a woman ruling them, regardless of how \u201cbroken\u201d Bran may appear. He\u2019s the male heir to the throne and that\u2019s enough for every House to support his claim. \n\nThe Fisher King theory has resurfaced again after the show\u2019s ending, but it\u2019s important to emphasise if you\u2019ve read it that it contradicts Bran becoming King of Westeros and even more so for something as petty as politics, because it makes an explicit magical connection between Bran and Winterfell. With the return of magic to the world, this connection becomes important for the Stark survival as the game of thrones becomes part of the old world order that\u2019s crumbling, taking all the players with it. Unless Winterfell becomes the centre of power for the entire continent (unlikely) Bran\u2019s set up to be KITN and to carry on the Stark legacy. </p><p>\n\nI disagree with the implication the theory makes that Bran ends up like a tree, though the Fisher King was physically tied to the land as one would be by merging with a weirwood tree. That\u2019s literally Bran\u2019s nightmare, and while the show\u2019s turned him into a weird robot, Bran has a remarkable capacity for love and compassion which we\u2019ve seen when he ruled Winterfell so he\u2019s more than capable of being a very sweet and kind king. \n\nFun fact: the Fisher King has also been compared to Bran the Blessed, the legendary King who also wins the Holy Grail and saves his sister who was married to an evil foreign king who abuses her. This sister was called the White Raven, and sent messages to her brother using \u2018little birds.\u2019 Sounds a lot like Sansa\u2019s story from the original outline, where she was married to Joffrey and similarly mistreated. \n\n<b>Bran Stark, the Fisher King, and Bran the Builder</b>\n\nThe Fisher King theory also brings up the potential connection between the Starks and the Others, but more importantly, establishes a connection with the man who founded House Stark and was the first King of Winter - Bran the Builder:\n\n<i>Understanding that the Builder as the Fisher King resolves many contradictions in his story, namely the idea that a man went to a race of beings who made their homes from wood and leaf to learn how to a build a stone castle. There was a purpose much beyond learning; he went to propose a union: human civilization and primordial forest, to create a monolith that is both castle and tree, ruled by a man that is both king and shaman, as it was meant to be. <b>And as it will be, by the only king in Westeros that GRRM and his story values and honors: Brandon Stark, the heir to Winterfell, son of Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn.</b></i>\n\nOur Bran has potential parallels with the first King of his name too: \n\n</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cYet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king\u2019s council. He might <b>raise castles like Brandon the Builder</b>, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mother\u2019s faith and become a High Septon.\u201d </p>\n- Eddard V, AGOT \n\nNed tells Arya that while Bran would never be a knight, he could raise a castle like their ancestor. In the show\u2019s video of the history of Westeros, narrated by Isaac Hempstead Wright himself, Bran the Builder is portrayed as being carried onto a platform, and several people have theorised that he was wheelchair-bound like our Bran is too. \n\nAnother passage of note is in Clash of Kings when Durran is said to raise a seventh castle, the largest of them all, and that he was directed to do so by a small boy, one who would Bran the Builder someday. At such a young age, he showed initiative and leadership, much like Bran Stark did when he was Lord of Winterfell in his brother\u2019s absence.\n\nMoreover, Bran the Builder built the Wall after the first great battle with the Others with the help of giants, and is said to have known the Children of the Forest. Bran has an established relationship with Leaf, the last of the Children, and has a very important part to play regarding the invasion by the Others (yeah fuck the show, it wasted his potential) because it\u2019s always been part of House Stark\u2019s destiny to protect the realm from them:\n\n<i> The Others are the wolves to hunt humans, the ice to bring balance to the fire. <b>The Starks in Winterfell act as one of the keepers of that balance, the lock on a gate that keeps at bay a dark power in the earth.</b></i>\n\nBran is the Stark carrying on the first King of Winter\u2019s legacy by allying with the Children of the Forest and having a front seat to the looming War for the Dawn, and as the show demonstrated, is the key to humanity\u2019s survival. That\u2019s not a show invention, his training is leading up to something far bigger than anything we\u2019ve seen before. \n\nAnd as Brandon Stark\u2019s heir to protecting the realm, it\u2019s only fitting that he gains the crown his ancestor wore as well.",

That&rsquo;s not a show invention, his training is leading up to something far bigger than anything we&rsquo;ve seen before. \n\nAnd as Brandon Stark&rsquo;s heir to protecting the realm, it&rsquo;s only fitting that he gains the crown his ancestor wore as well.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p>Bran becoming King is something I&rsquo;ve always considered, but now I&rsquo;m confident he becomes King in the North in the books.  </p>\n<p>If we take the show-verse, then yeah, it&rsquo;s completely out of nowhere. </p>\n<p>But the books carry just enough hints and foreshadowing that we can see how this becomes his endgame. But again, his throne is in the North. </p>\n\n</p>",
