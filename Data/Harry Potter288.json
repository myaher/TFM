Hopefully Credence creeping out the Dursleys for fun will make up for it!</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d asked Credence.</p><p>Harry took a deep, shaky breath and nodded. \u201cYeah. Yeah, this is\u2026 God, this is huge. Definitely about time.\u201d</p><p>Credence nodded and squeezed his shoulder. \u201cI got your back.\u201d</p><p>Harry clenched and unclenched his fists, then stood, jerkily, and crossed the road to 4 Privet Drive. Credence followed him, his head bull-lowered and his jaw jutting.</p><p>Harry knocked on the door, then bounced slightly on the balls of his feet, unable to stay still. Credence wanted to put his hand on his shoulder again, but there wasn\u2019t enough space on the step. And he didn\u2019t want to undermine him by drawing some sort of attention to his nerves.</p><p>The door opened to a thin woman with a fake social smile that disappeared the moment she saw Harry. Credence swallowed. God, but she looked like Ma. He made a particular effort to straighten his back. These were Harry\u2019s demons, not his, and he was going to be as silently hateful and obnoxious as he could. If Harry was anything like him, which, sure, he might not be, he was probably going to fall back into old habits. Credence glared up at the woman, making sure he was projecting as much disgust as he could. He was delighted when her eyes slightly widened at the sight of him behind Harry.</p><p>\u201cVernon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Petunia, I\u2019m watching the telly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVernon, come here, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want my stuff,\u201d said Harry, and Credence was <i>so proud</i> of how steady his voice was.</p><p>A man appeared behind Petunia, and he seemed to puff up when he saw Harry, his walrus moustache bristling. \u201cWell! You\u2019ve got a bloody nerve.\u201d he hissed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t show up at the train station, not a word of warning. We were stood about for a good half an hour in that\u2026 that freak show, waiting for you, and\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIf you just let me get my stuff, you\u2019ll be rid of me forever.\u201d</p><p>Petunia narrowed her eyes. \u201cWhat about that awful headmaster of yours?\u201d</p><p>Harry hesitated. \u201cThe situation\u2019s changed. I don\u2019t need to come here every year, so my godfather\u2019s offered to take me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour godfather? The criminal, eh?\u201d growled Vernon. \u201cWhere is he? You haven\u2019t brought him here, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, through gritted teeth.</p><p>Credence turned his eyes on Vernon, and tried not to blink too often. Vernon frowned at him, but drew back slightly, which Credence counted as a win. \u201cWho\u2019s this little freak, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Credence,\u201d snapped Harry. \u201cAnd he just fought in a battle against the greatest dark wizard of the century and won. Now can I please get my stuff and leave?\u201d</p><p>Vernon narrowed his eyes, but stepped back towards the doorway to the living room. Petunia took her cue from him and backed away as well, wringing her hands together. A boy about their age came to stand beside Vernon, looking between them all uncertainly. Harry walked to a cupboard below the stairs and glanced at Credence out of the corner of his eye before pulling it open.</p><p>Credence almost missed it, so busy making evil eyes at the family that had hurt his best friend. Harry\u2019s eyes closed briefly before he crouched down, and Credence noticed his breath speeding up ever so slightly as he leaned forwards. The door slipped and bumped him on the side, and he flinched violently.</p><p>He remembered a throwaway comment, a joke, <i>I lived in a literal cupboard for eleven years.</i> Harry had a habit of making things that hurt into things that could make others laugh, but it wasn\u2019t enough to take the hurt away from himself. Credence held the door, bent it backwards until the hinges creaked. Petunia winced, and Credence allowed the slightest smile as he creaked it even further backwards, away from Harry as he collected little knick-knacks and pictures, broken toys and torn books from under a floorboard.</p><p>Read the <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/13597110/chapters/36190389\">rest of this chapter</a> here, or <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/13597110/chapters/31213452\">start from the beginning</a> here!</p>",
