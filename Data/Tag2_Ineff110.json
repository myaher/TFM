The wheel clamps disappeared. <br/>\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have lunch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I owe you one from, when was it &hellip; &rdquo; &ldquo;Paris, 1793,&rdquo; said Aziraphale. <br/>\n&ldquo;Oh, yes. The Reign of Terror. Was that one of yours, or one of ours?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it yours?&rdquo; <br/>\n&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t recall. It was quite a good restaurant, though.&rdquo; <br/>\nAs they drove past an astonished traffic warden his notebook spontaneously combusted, to Crowley&rsquo;s amazement. <br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty certain I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that,&rdquo; he said.<br/>\n Aziraphale blushed. &ldquo;That was me,&rdquo; he said. <br/>\n&ldquo;I had always thought that your people invented them.&rdquo; <br/>\n&ldquo;Did you? We thought they were yours.&rdquo; Crowley stared at the smoke in the rearview mirror. <br/>\n&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do the Ritz.&rdquo; Crowley had not bothered to book. In his world, table reservations were things that happened to other people.",

After he had changed Adam into his striped pyjamas and put him to sleep in his portable crib at eight in the evening last night, he himself had spent two more hours sketching at his drawing board before finally calling it a night as well. And so, he managed to wake up of natural causes, five minutes before his alarm was meant to go off.<br/></p><p>A pair of gangly legs swung over the side of his bed, and Crowley sauntered into the living room to check on Adam, pulling on a pair of trousers along the way. The boy still slept peacefully, tightly clutching his a vaguely dog-shaped plush animal, which was simply named Dog according to his mums. He gently poked one of the rosy cheeks and pondered briefly what could have become of him, had he found someone nice to settle down with and adopted a child for themselves. The thought only stung more with the realization that he had, in fact, found someone nice to settle down with, but was too much of a coward to say it.</p><p>His eye fell on the freshly dusted-off drawing board that stood not too far away from the crib. A few sketches hung, taped to the surface, while others were crumpled up and strewn across the floor. Perhaps it had been too long, perhaps he had lost his touch.

He rather liked minimalism, Swiss graphic design and Bauhaus for their simplicity, but none of that would suit an epic about a witch that blew up an entire town in the seventeenth century.

I was trying to do some thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking or overthinking?\u201d Anathema asked carefully. The girl knew him too well for her own good.</p><p>\u201cThinking.\u201d Crowley lied. \u201cEzra asked me to make a proposal,\u201d</p><p>Anathema visibly perked up.</p><p>\u201cfor his next book cover.\u201d</p><p>And she immediately deflated again.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Anathema.

Like I\u2019ve heard it before.\u201d</p><p>His niece looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have.\u201d She said as she planted Adam back in her uncle\u2019s arms and started for the flat\u2019s door. \u201cCall Ezra, tell him I\u2019ve got something that\u2019ll make him go weak at the knees when he gets his hands on it. I\u2019ll meet you guys at the bookshop later today.\u201d She said with absolute certainty.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cHome. I have to beg to mum to let me take something out of the house.\u201d</p><hr><p>&ldquo;So, do you have any idea what Anathema wanted to show me?&rdquo; Ezra asked from above, standing on a ladder to dust off the tops of his shelves. It was just the three of them. The bookshop was closed for the day, and the two of them had just split a b\u00e1nh m\u00ec between themselves as their lunch.</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the slightest.&rdquo; Crowley said. He was sat in the windowsill beside bookshop&rsquo;s door with Adam in his lap, who held and drank his bottle of formula on his own. Adam was a very capable boy for his age, Crowley noted.</p><p>There was a loud ringing as a certain teenager stormed through the shop&rsquo;s front door with a gigantic grocery bag, despite the &lsquo;closed&rsquo; sign being up.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re closed.&rdquo; The shopkeeper droned on auto-pilot.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Anathema.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Ezra, hi uncle Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra turned to look at the new visitor and smiled before he confidently let himself slide down the ladder.</p><p>&ldquo;My, how you&rsquo;ve grown up, miss Device.&rdquo; Ezra beamed. &ldquo;How long has it been since you first came here? Nine years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ten, actually.&rdquo; Anathema said. &ldquo;Uncle Tony still owes me that book he never bought me because you two were too busy talking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does she always hold grudges like this?&rdquo; Ezra turned to Crowley, who simply said</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Anathema hoisted the grocery bag onto the counter and produced a thick binder. This one, Crowley recognized. It was a genealogy project she had put together for school several years ago.</p><p>They both watched in suspense as she scanned the meticulous index before she leafed through, looking for a very specific page.</p><p>&ldquo;It probably won&rsquo;t come as a surprise when I say that uncle Tony and I come from a long line of witches and heretics.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra shot Crowley an amused look. Crowley blushed. No, he didn\u2019t seem surprised at all.</p><p>&ldquo;At some point, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Illuminati got involved as well, but without hard evidence I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to include it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The point, Anathema.&rdquo; Crowley urged as he willed the redness from his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, the point is,&rdquo; Anathema said as she opened the binder, pulled a page from it and held it out to Ezra. &ldquo;Agnes Nutter was an ancestor of ours.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra turned as white as a sheet, the author took the page from her and read it over. And again. And again. Everything checked out. From the name to the family relations to the date and the cause of death.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe my eyes&hellip;&rdquo; He said breathlessly.</p><p>Anathema took the office chair from behind the till and put it behind Ezra.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to want to sit down for this one,&rdquo; She said.</p><p>And he did.</p><p>\u201cBecause here\u2019s the kicker. Agnes wasn&rsquo;t just a witch. She was a prophetess. She had visions of the future and knew she would one day be burned at the stake.&ldquo; Anathema said as she shoved the binder aside and went back to rummaging in the bag. &quot;So, the day before she knew she was to be burned, she sent her most prized possession to her son-in-law&rsquo;s farm a few towns away.&rdquo; The girl pulled something from the bag. It was dark and large, and judging from Anathema&rsquo;s face, it was heavy, too.</p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo; Ezra gasped.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but it is.&rdquo; Anathema grinned. &ldquo;A book containing Agnes Nutter\u2019s spells, visions and memoirs. All handwritten in old-timey English. It was a heirloom granny Ashtoreth left to me when she found out about my fascination with magic and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cDear, did you know any of this?\u201d Ezra asked as he spun his chair around to face the other man. The look of curiosity and genuine excitement on his face did something to Crowley\u2019s heart that he would never admit to another living person.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I had no idea.\u201d He said, holding up his free hand in self-defense. \u201cExcept for Anathema&rsquo;s childhood obsession with magic. She made sure everyone knew about that.&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cGranny said the book was meant for my eyes only, but I&rsquo;m giving you special permission to use it in your research.\u201d Anathema smiled proudly.</p><p>Ezra stood from his chair and walked over. He snatched a pair of cotton gloves from behind the counter and carefully started to leaf through it.</p><p>\u201cAnathema, this is exactly what I needed. This is going to fill in so many blanks, I\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to thank you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d She said casually as she stepped around the counter. \u201cJust promise to be careful with it and give it back when you\u2019re done with your book.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Ezra pulled the girl into what looked like a bone-crushing hug while Anathema giggled and patted his back.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you anyway. Have a look around, you can take home any one book you like. You deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I will!\u201d Anathema said, clasping her hands together in excitement before shooting her uncle another glare. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook, by the way.\u201d</p><p>With a pout, Crowley wiggled his wallet out of his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cFine, pick out a second book while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><hr><p>A few hours later, while Adam napped on the sofa in Ezra&rsquo;s apartment, Crowley sat at the desk in the back room, next to the shopkeeper himself, who did his taxes. He rubbed at his forehead in an attempt to remedy an oncoming headache as he scribbled in his sketchbook in the dim, orange light of a single light bulb that hung overhead.</p><p>&quot;That was exciting, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Ezra asked. He still had that blissful smile on his face, and Crowley knew it wasn&rsquo;t going away any time soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Crowley muttered sarcastically, &ldquo;nothing more exciting than finding out that you descended from a medieval witch annex prophetess that blew up an entire village and all the people in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, dear, it&rsquo;s quite alright.&rdquo; Ezra said as he placed a hand on Crowley\u2019s shoulder and squeezed in reassurance. &ldquo;I mean, it happened three hundred years ago. It\u2019s not like anyone could come after you.&rdquo;</p><p>A chill ran down his spine from the touch alone. He wanted to tell the other that <i>no, that was exactly the point</i>, but he wasn\u2019t about to have that conversation. </p><p>He thought he lucked out with his last name, though. After all, \u2018My name is Anthony, but you may call me Crowley\u2019 sounded infinitely cooler than \u2018My name is Anthony Nutter\u2019. Or \u2018Device\u2019, for that matter. Enough people called him a \u2018tool\u2019 as it was.</p><p>&ldquo;How is your drawing coming along?&rdquo; Ezra asked without looking up from his laptop.</p><p>Finally. Something Crowley could technically say something intelligent about. If it were anybody ask him.</p><p>&ldquo;Not as well as I hoped it would. I just don&rsquo;t know where to start. Nothing I come up with seems to suit the theme.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well\u2026 Maybe just give it time. You&rsquo;re good. I&rsquo;m absolutely positive you can do it.\u201d</p><p>Crowley smiled.</p><p>&quot;Glad one of us has that kind of faith in me.&rdquo;</p>",

After he had changed Adam into his striped pyjamas and put him to sleep in his portable crib at eight in the evening last night, he himself had spent two more hours sketching at his drawing board before finally calling it a night as well. And so, he managed to wake up of natural causes, five minutes before his alarm was meant to go off.<br></p><p>A pair of gangly legs swung over the side of his bed, and Crowley sauntered into the living room to check on Adam, pulling on a pair of trousers along the way. The boy still slept peacefully, tightly clutching his a vaguely dog-shaped plush animal, which was simply named Dog according to his mums. He gently poked one of the rosy cheeks and pondered briefly what could have become of him, had he found someone nice to settle down with and adopted a child for themselves.

What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>A single bushy, yet stylishly plucked eyebrow raised on the girl\u2019s face before her face pulled apart into a wicked grin. </p><p>\u201cJust checking if the kid made it through the night.\u201d </p><p>Crowley sighed and stepped aside to let her in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, he\u2019s sleeping like a\u2026 baby.\u201d He supplied when no sufficient metaphor came to mind.</p><p>Anathema crossed the room to peer over the edge of the crib. \u201cOh, he\u2019s the cutest!\u201d She whispered. \u201cHe reminds me of the babe, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe babe with the power.\u201d Anathema smirked.</p><p>\u201cNo. And by the way, I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t wake him up. I was trying to do some thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking or overthinking?\u201d Anathema asked carefully. The girl knew him too well for her own good.</p><p>\u201cThinking.\u201d Crowley lied. \u201cEzra asked me to make a proposal,\u201d</p><p>Anathema visibly perked up.</p><p>\u201cfor his next book cover.\u201d</p><p>And she immediately deflated again.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Anathema. I have no idea how to make a cover for a medieval themed book about the most metal witch that ever roamed this Earth.\u201d</p><p>Anathema scooped Adam out of his crib and walked over to the drawing board, holding him ever so gently.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Nice And Accurate Vengeance Of Agnes Nutter, Witch\u2019?\u201d She read aloud.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the title.\u201d Crowley nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but that name rings a bell. Like I\u2019ve heard it before.\u201d</p><p>His niece looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have.\u201d She said as she planted Adam back in her uncle\u2019s arms and started for the flat\u2019s door. \u201cCall Ezra, tell him I\u2019ve got something that\u2019ll make him go weak at the knees when he gets his hands on it. I\u2019ll meet you guys at the bookshop later today.\u201d She said with absolute certainty.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cHome. I have to beg to mum to let me take something out of the house.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cSo, do you have any idea what Anathema wanted to show me?\u201d Ezra asked from above, standing on a ladder to dust off the tops of his shelves. It was just the three of them. The bookshop was closed for the day, and the two of them had just split a b\u00e1nh m\u00ec between themselves as their lunch.</p><p>\u201cNot in the slightest.\u201d Crowley said. He was sat in the windowsill beside bookshop\u2019s door with Adam in his lap, who held and drank his bottle of formula on his own. Adam was a very capable boy for his age, Crowley noted.</p><p>There was a loud ringing as a certain teenager stormed through the shop\u2019s front door with a gigantic grocery bag, despite the \u2018closed\u2019 sign being up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed.\u201d The shopkeeper droned on auto-pilot.</p><p>\u201cHi Anathema.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Ezra, hi uncle Tony.\u201d</p><p>Ezra turned to look at the new visitor and smiled before he confidently let himself slide down the ladder.</p><p>\u201cMy, how you\u2019ve grown up, miss Device.\u201d Ezra beamed. \u201cHow long has it been since you first came here? Nine years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen, actually.\u201d Anathema said. \u201cUncle Tony still owes me that book he never bought me because you two were too busy talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she always hold grudges like this?\u201d Ezra turned to Crowley, who simply said</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Anathema hoisted the grocery bag onto the counter and produced a thick binder. This one, Crowley recognized. It was a genealogy project she had put together for school several years ago.</p><p>They both watched in suspense as she scanned the meticulous index before she leafed through, looking for a very specific page.</p><p>\u201cIt probably won\u2019t come as a surprise when I say that uncle Tony and I come from a long line of witches and heretics.\u201d</p><p>Ezra shot Crowley an amused look. Crowley blushed. No, he didn\u2019t seem surprised at all.</p><p>\u201cAt some point, I\u2019m pretty sure the Illuminati got involved as well, but without hard evidence I wasn\u2019t allowed to include it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point, Anathema.\u201d Crowley urged as he willed the redness from his face.</p><p>\u201cRight, the point is,\u201d Anathema said as she opened the binder, pulled a page from it and held it out to Ezra. \u201cAgnes Nutter was an ancestor of ours.\u201d</p><p>Ezra turned as white as a sheet, the author took the page from her and read it over. And again. And again. Everything checked out. From the name to the family relations to the date and the cause of death.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe my eyes\u2026\u201d He said breathlessly.</p><p>Anathema took the office chair from behind the till and put it behind Ezra.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to sit down for this one,\u201d She said.</p><p>And he did.</p><p>\u201cBecause here\u2019s the kicker. Agnes wasn\u2019t just a witch. She was a prophetess. She had visions of the future and knew she would one day be burned at the stake.\u201c Anathema said as she shoved the binder aside and went back to rummaging in the bag. \"So, the day before she knew she was to be burned, she sent her most prized possession to her son-in-law\u2019s farm a few towns away.\u201d The girl pulled something from the bag. It was dark and large, and judging from Anathema\u2019s face, it was heavy, too.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d Ezra gasped.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it is.\u201d Anathema grinned. \u201cA book containing Agnes Nutter\u2019s spells, visions and memoirs. All handwritten in old-timey English. It was a heirloom granny Ashtoreth left to me when she found out about my fascination with magic and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, did you know any of this?\u201d Ezra asked as he spun his chair around to face the other man. The look of curiosity and genuine excitement on his face did something to Crowley\u2019s heart that he would never admit to another living person.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I had no idea.\u201d He said, holding up his free hand in self-defense. \u201cExcept for Anathema\u2019s childhood obsession with magic.

I&rsquo;ll meet you guys at the bookshop later today.&rdquo; She said with absolute certainty.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Home. I have to beg to mum to let me take something out of the house.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;So, do you have any idea what Anathema wanted to show me?&rdquo; Ezra asked from above, standing on a ladder to dust off the tops of his shelves. It was just the three of them. The bookshop was closed for the day, and the two of them had just split a b&aacute;nh m&igrave; between themselves as their lunch.</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the slightest.&rdquo; Crowley said. He was sat in the windowsill beside bookshop&rsquo;s door with Adam in his lap, who held and drank his bottle of formula on his own. Adam was a very capable boy for his age, Crowley noted.</p><p>There was a loud ringing as a certain teenager stormed through the shop&rsquo;s front door with a gigantic grocery bag, despite the &lsquo;closed&rsquo; sign being up.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re closed.&rdquo; The shopkeeper droned on auto-pilot.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Anathema.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Ezra, hi uncle Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra turned to look at the new visitor and smiled before he confidently let himself slide down the ladder.</p><p>&ldquo;My, how you&rsquo;ve grown up, miss Device.&rdquo; Ezra beamed. &ldquo;How long has it been since you first came here? Nine years?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ten, actually.&rdquo; Anathema said. &ldquo;Uncle Tony still owes me that book he never bought me because you two were too busy talking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does she always hold grudges like this?&rdquo; Ezra turned to Crowley, who simply said</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Anathema hoisted the grocery bag onto the counter and produced a thick binder. This one, Crowley recognized. It was a genealogy project she had put together for school several years ago.</p><p>They both watched in suspense as she scanned the meticulous index before she leafed through, looking for a very specific page.</p><p>&ldquo;It probably won&rsquo;t come as a surprise when I say that uncle Tony and I come from a long line of witches and heretics.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra shot Crowley an amused look. Crowley blushed. No, he didn&rsquo;t seem surprised at all.</p><p>&ldquo;At some point, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Illuminati got involved as well, but without hard evidence I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to include it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The point, Anathema.&rdquo; Crowley urged as he willed the redness from his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, the point is,&rdquo; Anathema said as she opened the binder, pulled a page from it and held it out to Ezra. &ldquo;Agnes Nutter was an ancestor of ours.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra turned as white as a sheet, the author took the page from her and read it over. And again. And again. Everything checked out. From the name to the family relations to the date and the cause of death.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe my eyes&hellip;&rdquo; He said breathlessly.</p><p>Anathema took the office chair from behind the till and put it behind Ezra.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to want to sit down for this one,&rdquo; She said.</p><p>And he did.</p><p>&ldquo;Because here&rsquo;s the kicker. Agnes wasn&rsquo;t just a witch. She was a prophetess. She had visions of the future and knew she would one day be burned at the stake.&ldquo; Anathema said as she shoved the binder aside and went back to rummaging in the bag. \"So, the day before she knew she was to be burned, she sent her most prized possession to her son-in-law&rsquo;s farm a few towns away.&rdquo; The girl pulled something from the bag. It was dark and large, and judging from Anathema&rsquo;s face, it was heavy, too.</p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo; Ezra gasped.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but it is.&rdquo; Anathema grinned. &ldquo;A book containing Agnes Nutter&rsquo;s spells, visions and memoirs. All handwritten in old-timey English. It was a heirloom granny Ashtoreth left to me when she found out about my fascination with magic and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear, did you know any of this?&rdquo; Ezra asked as he spun his chair around to face the other man. The look of curiosity and genuine excitement on his face did something to Crowley&rsquo;s heart that he would never admit to another living person.</p><p>&ldquo;Again, I had no idea.&rdquo; He said, holding up his free hand in self-defense. &ldquo;Except for Anathema&rsquo;s childhood obsession with magic. She made sure everyone knew about that.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Granny said the book was meant for my eyes only, but I&rsquo;m giving you special permission to use it in your research.&rdquo; Anathema smiled proudly.</p><p>Ezra stood from his chair and walked over. He snatched a pair of cotton gloves from behind the counter and carefully started to leaf through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Anathema, this is exactly what I needed. This is going to fill in so many blanks, I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you for this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No need to thank me.&rdquo; She said casually as she stepped around the counter. &ldquo;Just promise to be careful with it and give it back when you&rsquo;re done with your book.&rdquo;</p><p>Without another word, Ezra pulled the girl into what looked like a bone-crushing hug while Anathema giggled and patted his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, thank you anyway. Have a look around, you can take home any one book you like. You deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I will!&rdquo; Anathema said, clasping her hands together in excitement before shooting her uncle another glare. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re off the hook, by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>With a pout, Crowley wiggled his wallet out of his back pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, pick out a second book while you&rsquo;re at it.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>A few hours later, while Adam napped on the sofa in Ezra&rsquo;s apartment, Crowley sat at the desk in the back room, next to the shopkeeper himself, who did his taxes. He rubbed at his forehead in an attempt to remedy an oncoming headache as he scribbled in his sketchbook in the dim, orange light of a single light bulb that hung overhead.</p><p>\"That was exciting, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Ezra asked. He still had that blissful smile on his face, and Crowley knew it wasn&rsquo;t going away any time soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Crowley muttered sarcastically, &ldquo;nothing more exciting than finding out that you descended from a medieval witch annex prophetess that blew up an entire village and all the people in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, dear, it&rsquo;s quite alright.&rdquo; Ezra said as he placed a hand on Crowley&rsquo;s shoulder and squeezed in reassurance. &ldquo;I mean, it happened three hundred years ago. It&rsquo;s not like anyone could come after you.&rdquo;</p><p>A chill ran down his spine from the touch alone. He wanted to tell the other that <i>no, that was exactly the point</i>, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to have that conversation. </p><p>He thought he lucked out with his last name, though. After all, &lsquo;My name is Anthony, but you may call me Crowley&rsquo; sounded infinitely cooler than &lsquo;My name is Anthony Nutter&rsquo;. Or &lsquo;Device&rsquo;, for that matter. Enough people called him a &lsquo;tool&rsquo; as it was.</p><p>&ldquo;How is your drawing coming along?&rdquo; Ezra asked without looking up from his laptop.</p><p>Finally. Something Crowley could technically say something intelligent about. If it were anybody ask him.</p><p>&ldquo;Not as well as I hoped it would. I just don&rsquo;t know where to start. Nothing I come up with seems to suit the theme.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Maybe just give it time. You&rsquo;re good. I&rsquo;m absolutely positive you can do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley smiled.</p><p>\"Glad one of us has that kind of faith in me.&rdquo;</p>",

        "answer": "<blockquote>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d\n\n</blockquote><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGet down there, dear,\u201d Aziraphale said mindlessly. In the corner of his eye, he had just spotted Crowley, sitting on some of his books, trying to balance himself out. It\u2019s a pretty high pile, Aziraphale had to admit, but they have to go into a certain shelf and this bookshelf is currently completely filled. He could move some of the books of that shelf to another place, he could maybe even take the globe away and put it somewhere else, but such things need time and a certain motivation, and Aziraphale had neither of it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley sais without even trying to leave the book pile. Instead, he tried to climb completely onto it.</p><p>Aziraphale glared over to him. \u201cAt least take your shoes off.\u201d <br/></p><!-- more --><p>Obediently, Crowley took his shoes off. Standing on one foot, he came close to falling down and to make the pile fall with him. But he managed, and Aziraphale didn\u2019t have to save the demon from under a bunch of books. The poor books\u2026</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up there anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Crowley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping you here, you\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to be up here if someone wouldn\u2019t prioritize doing his taxes over spending time with a friend.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s eyes flickered over from the greenish lines on the screen to Crowley. \u201cYou\u2019re not my friend, you\u2019re my enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the closest thing you have to an actual friend who isn\u2019t a human.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough, Aziraphale admitted quietly and focused back on the screen. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain what exactly you\u2019re doing on the books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game I\u2019ve heard about. It\u2019s called \u2018The floor is lava\u2019. You play it by-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the floor isn\u2019t lava, it\u2019s wood,\u201d Aziraphale started to lecture Crowley.</p><p>\u201cAziraphale-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some carpets and other things. But even if it was, there\u2019s no point of you being on my books. They\u2019d just burn down faster than you\u2019re able to react. Which I don\u2019t even want to think about! And then you\u2019d be in the lava, which has no consequences for you since you\u2019re a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just imagine that the floor is lava,\u201d Crowley corrected as he climbed over to another pile. He was close enough to a shelf now, so he put his shoes into it. \u201cYou have to get from one end of the room to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a silly game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a children\u2019s game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are no child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201cCrowley climbed onto the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously. What\u2019s the goal of the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to die in the lava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could just stay on the table forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s boring, you have to keep moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should play sometimes else. How about that game where you eat things. I\u2019d like to see you try eating a whole orange again.\u201d</p><p>Crowley laughed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Crowley had tried taking ridiculously big objects into his mouth when he was drunk more than once.

Crowley had insisted upon seeing Queen on Thursday, having been adamant that Aziraphale would\u00a0\u201clove them\u201d, and Aziraphale had agreed - contingent upon Crowley agreeing to go and see Elton John with him on Saturday.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>Unbeknownst to Crowley,\u00a0\u2018Zira and Elton were quite good friends; good enough that Aziraphale called him\u00a0\u201cElton\u201d and Elton called him\u00a0\u201cZira\u201d. They were such good friends, in fact, that they got to watch the show from backstage, where there was an impressive array of nibbles. Crowley enjoyed the nibbles, but he did not enjoy Elton - the show nor just how chummy he seemed to be with Aziraphale.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>While the two of them spoke animatedly and Aziraphale complimented him on his latest stage costume (<i>which made sense</i>, Crowley supposed, <i>since\u00a0they were both walking fashion faux pas</i>), Crowley found himself feeling something&hellip; gnawingly <i>familiar</i>. It took him a few minutes and several mini quiche to figure it out, but he eventually got there.</small></p><p><small><b>This was Oscar Wilde all over again. </b>Honestly, you take <i>one</i> century-long nap and suddenly your best fri- <i>your adversary </i>has a new best fri- &hellip;<i>acquaintance.</i>\u00a0Although, Aziraphale and Wilde had certainly been more than just\u00a0\u201cacquaintances\u201d. Were he and Elton more-than-acquaintances, too? It wouldn\u2019t have surprised Crowley. Musicians rarely gave back-stage passes to just<i> anyone</i>.</small></p><p><small>Gritting his teeth, his serpentine tongue threatening to flick out with irritation, Crowley began to realize that he was<i> jealous</i>. He was jealous of how easily this flash-bastard-in-sunglasses was able to coax a smile from Aziraphale and make him laugh. <i>He</i> was supposed to be the only flash-bastard-in-sunglasses who got to do that. Really, that\u2019s probably the best explanation for why Crowley did what he did next.</small></p><p><small>He fainted. He full on passed-the-fuck-out, and he made a grand show of it, too. He\u2019d been clutching a flute of fizzing pink champagne which just-so-happened to splatter all over Elton\u2019s elaborate, sparkling white costume when he pitched forward, the glass shattering on the floor as it fell from his grip. He also landed square in Aziraphale\u2019s arms.\u00a0</small></p><!-- more --><p><small>Elton had thrown a fit over his ruined costume, as he was known to do over the slightest inconvenience back then, but Aziraphale had been too stunned to even splutter out an apology before the diva stormed off. He and Crowley weren\u2019t human; they didn\u2019t <i>faint</i>. Not unless something was seriously wrong with their corporation.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>(<i>Did crippling jealousy which induced a splitting headache and a pounding heart count as\u00a0\u201cseriously wrong\u201d? If so, then yes, something was seriously wrong with Crowley\u2019s corporation.</i>)</small></p><p><small>When Crowley finally came to, he realized three things: <b>1)</b> that he was most definitely in the backseat of the Bentley, if the roof he was staring at was any indication; <b>2) </b>his sunglasses had been pushed up into his hair, which explained why the pale moonlight was making his slit-like pupils dilate; and <b>3)</b> he was sprawled out over said backseat with his head in Aziraphale\u2019s lap, the angel\u2019s fingers gently combing through his hair. Okay, Crowley realized<i><b> four</b></i> things when he finally came to, the fourth being that Aziraphale doing<i> that</i> to his hair felt bloody <i>marvelous</i>.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>\u201cWhat in H- Heav- ugh. What in <i>Somewhere\u2019s</i> name happened?\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cAh, you\u2019re finally awake,\u201d Aziraphale mused when he realized that Crowley had rejoined the land of the living, but he didn\u2019t stop toying with his hair. After dragging Crowley\u2019s unconscious corporation out to the Bentley, he\u2019d sat like this with him for a good hour-and-a-half while he waited for him to wake up. In that time, he\u2019d come to the realization that the demon had exceptionally soft hair.\u00a0<br/></small></p><p><small>Realizing that the aforementioned demon was waiting on an answer, Aziraphale cleared his throat before explaining,\u00a0\u201cYou fainted&hellip; straight into my arms.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cI <i>what?</i>\u201d Crowley squeaked, his yellow eyes widening, and Aziraphale exhaled a rather breathless chuckle. Truth be told, even now that Crowley was awake, he was still worried. This was hardly normal behaviour.\u00a0<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cYou fainted, my dear. I was in the middle of telling Elton how frequently I\u2019ve listened to\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t Let The Sun Go Down On Me\u2019 since his latest record came out, and the next thing I knew your nose was smashing into my chest and I was the only thing keeping you from hitting the ground.\u201d\u00a0<br/></small></p><p><small>Cracking the smallest of smiles, Aziraphale teased,\u00a0\u201cYou know, if you wanted my attention, dear boy, you didn\u2019t have to go to such extremes. We\u2019ll certainly never get back-stage passes again after your little performance.\u201d</small></p><p><small>Aziraphale had no idea how closely he came to hitting the nail on the head regarding Crowley fainting\u00a0\u201cto get [his] attention\u201d, and the demon clamped his jaw shut to keep from doing something stupid, like saying so aloud. Aziraphale\u2019s smile slipped as quickly as it appeared, though, and he quietly added,\u00a0\u201cYou gave me quite a fright.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cSorry,\u201d Crowley mumbled, not putting much inflection into the sentiment, and he felt his eyes flutter shut of their own volition as Aziraphale\u2019s fingers began combing through his hair again. Despite his best efforts, a tiny noise of enjoyment escaped him.\u00a0<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cAre you feeling quite alright? I\u2019ve never seen you faint before. If there\u2019s something wrong with your corporation&hellip; Well, perhaps you should contact your superiors-\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>Scoffing at the notion, Crowley shook his head, finally forcing himself to sit up, righting his sunglasses as he did so. Once they were safely back on his nose, obscuring his eyes from view, Crowley stated,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u00a0\u2018M fine, angel, really. Just haven\u2019t slept in a few days; y\u2019know, what with the concerts. This body\u2019s used to sleeping. I guess I sort of&hellip; crashed.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cWell, come here, then.\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>Blinking behind the thick lenses of his sunglasses, Crowley furrowed his brow as he looked over at the angel sitting beside him. They were parked a few metres away from a street lamp, and Crowley found himself noticing for the first time since regaining consciousness that Aziraphale was basked in a sort of&hellip; <i>glow</i>, both from the street lamp and the moonlight shining down from high above. If you looked at him just right, his halo was almost visible; it was always more palpable at night, when the sunlight wasn\u2019t there to obstruct it.</small></p><p><small>\u201cWhat?\u201d Crowley finally asked, the response rather delayed, and he gave his head a shake when Aziraphale opened his arms and beckoned him forward.\u00a0\u201cNuh. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019ll drive you back and then go home - unless you want to stay?\u201d\u00a0<br/></small></p><p><small>He refrained from making a snide remark about <i>Elton</i>, but oh, how he wanted to.</small></p><p><small>\u201cYou are the one who\u2019s being ridiculous, my dear. If you\u00a0\u2018crash\u2019 while you\u2019re driving, then <i>we </i>crash, quite literally. I don\u2019t know about you, but I rather like this body. I think I\u2019d like to keep it a while longer.\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cIt\u2019sssssss a nice body,\u201d Crowley agreed, awkwardly clearing his throat to clarify,\u00a0\u201cY\u2019know&hellip; by human standards. Blond isssssss&hellip; pretty.\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>To Crowley\u2019s surprise, the angel didn\u2019t snort at the compliment(s); rather, he looked to be&hellip; quite <i>chuffed </i>by them.</small></p><p><small>\u201cOh, come here, you silly goose,\u201d Aziraphale sighed, smiling as he took Crowley\u2019s hand and gave it a tug - with an unrelenting amount of Angelic Force. Instantly, he found himself with his face pressed once again to his Adversary\u2019s chest, which was remarkably comfortable despite the hideous tartan sweater currently covering it. As soon as the angel\u2019s arms wound around him, he forgot himself, melting into the embrace like a snake unraveling from being tightly coiled.<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cThere, now,\u201d Aziraphale hummed, giving Crowley a small squeeze.\u00a0\u201cGet some proper rest. I\u2019ll wake you when the sun comes up and I want to go home.\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>Crowley didn\u2019t need to be told twice. Being wrapped up in Aziraphale\u2019s arms, and subsequently in his Angelic Grace, wasn\u2019t unpleasant (like it should have been) but rather felt like being swaddled in a warm blanket (which it <i>definitely shouldn\u2019t</i> have been). He was asleep within seconds, breathing softly against the angel\u2019s chest.</small></p><p><small>To tell you the truth, Aziraphale didn\u2019t really mind all that much that his conversation with Elton was cut short. An evening spent with Crowley, no matter what they did, was always an evening well spent.\u00a0</small></p><blockquote><p><small>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://apictureofspace.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">Submit a prompt?</a></b>\n\n<br/></small></p></blockquote>",

I guess I sort of\u2026 crashed.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cWell, come here, then.\u201d<br></small></p><p><small>Blinking behind the thick lenses of his sunglasses, Crowley furrowed his brow as he looked over at the angel sitting beside him. They were parked a few metres away from a street lamp, and Crowley found himself noticing for the first time since regaining consciousness that Aziraphale was basked in a sort of\u2026 <i>glow</i>, both from the street lamp and the moonlight shining down from high above. If you looked at him just right, his halo was almost visible; it was always more palpable at night, when the sunlight wasn\u2019t there to obstruct it.</small></p><p><small>\u201cWhat?\u201d Crowley finally asked, the response rather delayed, and he gave his head a shake when Aziraphale opened his arms and beckoned him forward.\u00a0\u201cNuh. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019ll drive you back and then go home - unless you want to stay?\u201d\u00a0<br></small></p><p><small>He refrained from making a snide remark about <i>Elton</i>, but oh, how he wanted to.</small></p><p><small>\u201cYou are the one who\u2019s being ridiculous, my dear. If you\u00a0\u2018crash\u2019 while you\u2019re driving, then <i>we </i>crash, quite literally. I don\u2019t know about you, but I rather like this body. I think I\u2019d like to keep it a while longer.\u201d<br></small></p><p><small>\u201cIt\u2019sssssss a nice body,\u201d Crowley agreed, awkwardly clearing his throat to clarify,\u00a0\u201cY\u2019know\u2026 by human standards. Blond isssssss\u2026 pretty.\u201d<br></small></p><p><small>To Crowley\u2019s surprise, the angel didn\u2019t snort at the compliment(s); rather, he looked to be\u2026 quite <i>chuffed </i>by them.</small></p><p><small>\u201cOh, come here, you silly goose,\u201d Aziraphale sighed, smiling as he took Crowley\u2019s hand and gave it a tug - with an unrelenting amount of Angelic Force. Instantly, he found himself with his face pressed once again to his Adversary\u2019s chest, which was remarkably comfortable despite the hideous tartan sweater currently covering it. As soon as the angel\u2019s arms wound around him, he forgot himself, melting into the embrace like a snake unraveling from being tightly coiled.<br></small></p><p><small>\u201cThere, now,\u201d Aziraphale hummed, giving Crowley a small squeeze.\u00a0\u201cGet some proper rest. I\u2019ll wake you when the sun comes up and I want to go home.\u201d<br></small></p><p><small>Crowley didn\u2019t need to be told twice. Being wrapped up in Aziraphale\u2019s arms, and subsequently in his Angelic Grace, wasn\u2019t unpleasant (like it should have been) but rather felt like being swaddled in a warm blanket (which it <i>definitely shouldn\u2019t</i> have been). He was asleep within seconds, breathing softly against the angel\u2019s chest.</small></p><p><small>To tell you the truth, Aziraphale didn\u2019t really mind all that much that his conversation with Elton was cut short. An evening spent with Crowley, no matter what they did, was always an evening well spent.\u00a0</small></p><blockquote><p><small>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://apictureofspace.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">Submit a prompt?</a></b>\n\n<br></small></p></blockquote></p>",

Crowley had insisted upon seeing Queen on Thursday, having been adamant that Aziraphale would\u00a0\u201clove them\u201d, and Aziraphale had agreed - contingent upon Crowley agreeing to go and see Elton John with him on Saturday.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>Unbeknownst to Crowley,\u00a0\u2018Zira and Elton were quite good friends; good enough that Aziraphale called him\u00a0\u201cElton\u201d and Elton called him\u00a0\u201cZira\u201d. They were such good friends, in fact, that they got to watch the show from backstage, where there was an impressive array of nibbles. Crowley enjoyed the nibbles, but he did not enjoy Elton - the show nor just how chummy he seemed to be with Aziraphale.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>While the two of them spoke animatedly and Aziraphale complimented him on his latest stage costume (<i>which made sense</i>, Crowley supposed, <i>since\u00a0they were both walking fashion faux pas</i>), Crowley found himself feeling something\u2026 gnawingly <i>familiar</i>. It took him a few minutes and several mini quiche to figure it out, but he eventually got there.</small></p><p><small><b>This was Oscar Wilde all over again. </b>Honestly, you take <i>one</i> century-long nap and suddenly your best fri- <i>your adversary </i>has a new best fri- \u2026<i>acquaintance.</i>\u00a0Although, Aziraphale and Wilde had certainly been more than just\u00a0\u201cacquaintances\u201d. Were he and Elton more-than-acquaintances, too? It wouldn\u2019t have surprised Crowley. Musicians rarely gave back-stage passes to just<i> anyone</i>.</small></p><p><small>Gritting his teeth, his serpentine tongue threatening to flick out with irritation, Crowley began to realize that he was<i> jealous</i>. He was jealous of how easily this flash-bastard-in-sunglasses was able to coax a smile from Aziraphale and make him laugh. <i>He</i> was supposed to be the only flash-bastard-in-sunglasses who got to do that. Really, that\u2019s probably the best explanation for why Crowley did what he did next.</small></p><p><small>He fainted. He full on passed-the-fuck-out, and he made a grand show of it, too. He\u2019d been clutching a flute of fizzing pink champagne which just-so-happened to splatter all over Elton\u2019s elaborate, sparkling white costume when he pitched forward, the glass shattering on the floor as it fell from his grip. He also landed square in Aziraphale\u2019s arms.\u00a0</small></p>[[MORE]]<p><small>Elton had thrown a fit over his ruined costume, as he was known to do over the slightest inconvenience back then, but Aziraphale had been too stunned to even splutter out an apology before the diva stormed off. He and Crowley weren\u2019t human; they didn\u2019t <i>faint</i>. Not unless something was seriously wrong with their corporation.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>(<i>Did crippling jealousy which induced a splitting headache and a pounding heart count as\u00a0\u201cseriously wrong\u201d? If so, then yes, something was seriously wrong with Crowley\u2019s corporation.</i>)</small></p><p><small>When Crowley finally came to, he realized three things: <b>1)</b> that he was most definitely in the backseat of the Bentley, if the roof he was staring at was any indication; <b>2) </b>his sunglasses had been pushed up into his hair, which explained why the pale moonlight was making his slit-like pupils dilate; and <b>3)</b> he was sprawled out over said backseat with his head in Aziraphale\u2019s lap, the angel\u2019s fingers gently combing through his hair. Okay, Crowley realized<i><b> four</b></i> things when he finally came to, the fourth being that Aziraphale doing<i> that</i> to his hair felt bloody <i>marvelous</i>.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>\u201cWhat in H- Heav- ugh. What in <i>Somewhere\u2019s</i> name happened?\u201d<br></small></p><p><small>\u201cAh, you\u2019re finally awake,\u201d Aziraphale mused when he realized that Crowley had rejoined the land of the living, but he didn\u2019t stop toying with his hair. After dragging Crowley\u2019s unconscious corporation out to the Bentley, he\u2019d sat like this with him for a good hour-and-a-half while he waited for him to wake up. In that time, he\u2019d come to the realization that the demon had exceptionally soft hair.\u00a0<br></small></p><p><small>Realizing that the aforementioned demon was waiting on an answer, Aziraphale cleared his throat before explaining,\u00a0\u201cYou fainted\u2026 straight into my arms.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cI <i>what?</i>\u201d Crowley squeaked, his yellow eyes widening, and Aziraphale exhaled a rather breathless chuckle. Truth be told, even now that Crowley was awake, he was still worried. This was hardly normal behaviour.\u00a0<br></small></p><p><small>\u201cYou fainted, my dear. I was in the middle of telling Elton how frequently I\u2019ve listened to\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t Let The Sun Go Down On Me\u2019 since his latest record came out, and the next thing I knew your nose was smashing into my chest and I was the only thing keeping you from hitting the ground.\u201d\u00a0<br></small></p><p><small>Cracking the smallest of smiles, Aziraphale teased,\u00a0\u201cYou know, if you wanted my attention, dear boy, you didn\u2019t have to go to such extremes. We\u2019ll certainly never get back-stage passes again after your little performance.\u201d</small></p><p><small>Aziraphale had no idea how closely he came to hitting the nail on the head regarding Crowley fainting\u00a0\u201cto get [his] attention\u201d, and the demon clamped his jaw shut to keep from doing something stupid, like saying so aloud. Aziraphale\u2019s smile slipped as quickly as it appeared, though, and he quietly added,\u00a0\u201cYou gave me quite a fright.\u201d</small></p><p><small>\u201cSorry,\u201d Crowley mumbled, not putting much inflection into the sentiment, and he felt his eyes flutter shut of their own volition as Aziraphale\u2019s fingers began combing through his hair again. Despite his best efforts, a tiny noise of enjoyment escaped him.\u00a0<br></small></p><p><small>\u201cAre you feeling quite alright? I\u2019ve never seen you faint before. If there\u2019s something wrong with your corporation\u2026 Well, perhaps you should contact your superiors-\u201d<br></small></p><p><small>Scoffing at the notion, Crowley shook his head, finally forcing himself to sit up, righting his sunglasses as he did so. Once they were safely back on his nose, obscuring his eyes from view, Crowley stated,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u00a0\u2018M fine, angel, really.

I&rsquo;ll drive you back and then go home - unless you want to stay?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></small></p><p><small>He refrained from making a snide remark about <i>Elton</i>, but oh, how he wanted to.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;You are the one who&rsquo;s being ridiculous, my dear. If you&nbsp;&lsquo;crash&rsquo; while you&rsquo;re driving, then <i>we </i>crash, quite literally. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I rather like this body. I think I&rsquo;d like to keep it a while longer.&rdquo;<br /></small></p><p><small>&ldquo;It&rsquo;sssssss a nice body,&rdquo; Crowley agreed, awkwardly clearing his throat to clarify,&nbsp;&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know&hellip; by human standards. Blond isssssss&hellip; pretty.&rdquo;<br /></small></p><p><small>To Crowley&rsquo;s surprise, the angel didn&rsquo;t snort at the compliment(s); rather, he looked to be&hellip; quite <i>chuffed </i>by them.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Oh, come here, you silly goose,&rdquo; Aziraphale sighed, smiling as he took Crowley&rsquo;s hand and gave it a tug - with an unrelenting amount of Angelic Force. Instantly, he found himself with his face pressed once again to his Adversary&rsquo;s chest, which was remarkably comfortable despite the hideous tartan sweater currently covering it. As soon as the angel&rsquo;s arms wound around him, he forgot himself, melting into the embrace like a snake unraveling from being tightly coiled.<br /></small></p><p><small>&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; Aziraphale hummed, giving Crowley a small squeeze.&nbsp;&ldquo;Get some proper rest. I&rsquo;ll wake you when the sun comes up and I want to go home.&rdquo;<br /></small></p><p><small>Crowley didn&rsquo;t need to be told twice. Being wrapped up in Aziraphale&rsquo;s arms, and subsequently in his Angelic Grace, wasn&rsquo;t unpleasant (like it should have been) but rather felt like being swaddled in a warm blanket (which it <i>definitely shouldn&rsquo;t</i> have been). He was asleep within seconds, breathing softly against the angel&rsquo;s chest.</small></p><p><small>To tell you the truth, Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t really mind all that much that his conversation with Elton was cut short. An evening spent with Crowley, no matter what they did, was always an evening well spent.&nbsp;</small></p><blockquote><p><small>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://apictureofspace.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">Submit a prompt?</a></b>\n\n<br /></small></p></blockquote></p>",

Crowley had insisted upon seeing Queen on Thursday, having been adamant that Aziraphale would&nbsp;&ldquo;love them&rdquo;, and Aziraphale had agreed - contingent upon Crowley agreeing to go and see Elton John with him on Saturday.&nbsp;</small></p>\n<p><small>Unbeknownst to Crowley,&nbsp;&lsquo;Zira and Elton were quite good friends; good enough that Aziraphale called him&nbsp;&ldquo;Elton&rdquo; and Elton called him&nbsp;&ldquo;Zira&rdquo;. They were such good friends, in fact, that they got to watch the show from backstage, where there was an impressive array of nibbles. Crowley enjoyed the nibbles, but he did not enjoy Elton - the show nor just how chummy he seemed to be with Aziraphale.&nbsp;</small></p>\n<p><small>While the two of them spoke animatedly and Aziraphale complimented him on his latest stage costume (<i>which made sense</i>, Crowley supposed, <i>since&nbsp;they were both walking fashion faux pas</i>), Crowley found himself feeling something&hellip; gnawingly <i>familiar</i>. It took him a few minutes and several mini quiche to figure it out, but he eventually got there.</small></p>\n<p><small><b>This was Oscar Wilde all over again. </b>Honestly, you take <i>one</i> century-long nap and suddenly your best fri- <i>your adversary </i>has a new best fri- &hellip;<i>acquaintance.</i>&nbsp;Although, Aziraphale and Wilde had certainly been more than just&nbsp;&ldquo;acquaintances&rdquo;. Were he and Elton more-than-acquaintances, too? It wouldn&rsquo;t have surprised Crowley. Musicians rarely gave back-stage passes to just<i> anyone</i>.</small></p>\n<p><small>Gritting his teeth, his serpentine tongue threatening to flick out with irritation, Crowley began to realize that he was<i> jealous</i>. He was jealous of how easily this flash-bastard-in-sunglasses was able to coax a smile from Aziraphale and make him laugh. <i>He</i> was supposed to be the only flash-bastard-in-sunglasses who got to do that. Really, that&rsquo;s probably the best explanation for why Crowley did what he did next.</small></p>\n<p><small>He fainted. He full on passed-the-fuck-out, and he made a grand show of it, too. He&rsquo;d been clutching a flute of fizzing pink champagne which just-so-happened to splatter all over Elton&rsquo;s elaborate, sparkling white costume when he pitched forward, the glass shattering on the floor as it fell from his grip. He also landed square in Aziraphale&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;</small></p>\n</p>",

The extra layers of warmth would do him good on his walk - and he was <i>hardly</i> going to change in front of Crowley. The demon was undressed enough for the both of them combined.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Aziraphale finally replied, as nonchalantly as he could manage.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I use it; someone might as well.\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cWe could use it together,\u201d Crowley replied, in a shockingly casual sort of way - one that left Aziraphale spluttering, his blue eyes wide, and his voice nothing but a series of squeaks.<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cWell, I&hellip; I&hellip; <i>I never! </i>That is, I <i>would</i> never! I can\u2019t believe you would even <i>suggest</i> such a thing-\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cI was talking about<i> taking a nap</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley cut in, frowning, rather offended by the angel\u2019s abruptness.\u00a0\u201cWould that really be so terrible?\u201d<br/></small></p><p><small>Clamping his mouth shut, his hands still anxiously fidgeting, Aziraphale blew a flustered breath out of his nose. Truthfully, he had seriously considered taking a long nap after the ordeal of preventing the apocalypse and the tremendous amount of anxiety that followed and still lingered even now, three years later. But he couldn\u2019t. Divine Grace never sleeps.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>And it certainly doesn\u2019t do what he\u2019d thought Crowley was proposing -\u00a0</small></p><p><small>- even if he has thought about it, from time to time&hellip; and perhaps more frequently in recent years. Swallowing the lump that had risen in his throat, choosing not to dwell on<i> that</i> train of thought, Aziraphale opted to change the subject entirely, stating,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m off to the bakery down the street for poppy seed muffins. You\u2019re more than welcome to stay and nap if you wish - but do come down for tea later. Now that I know you\u2019re here, it would be rude of me not to ask <i>and</i> for you not to come.\u201d</small></p><p><small>Not to mention, now that he knew Crowley was here, in his present state of undress, it was likely all that he would be able to think about until he once again saw the demon fully-clothed.\u00a0</small></p><blockquote><p><small><b><a href=\"http://apictureofspace.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">Submit a prompt?</a></b></small></p></blockquote>",
