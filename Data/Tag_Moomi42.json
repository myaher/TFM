        "body": "<p>I\u2019ve been into Moominvalley lately, and I particularly love Moomintroll &amp; Snufkin\u2019s relationship, but I was\u00a0stumped on this little object that clearly meant to have some symbolism relating to the two; until I went back and re-watched parts of the episode and I have an interpretation now.</p><!-- more --><p>We\u2019re first introduced to Moomintroll\u2019s bark boat at the beginning of the episode\u00a0\u201cMoominsummer Madness\u201d when Moominmama gives it to him, to his excitement. Little My comments on him being\u00a0\u201ctoo big\u201d for it, to which he replies that it\u2019s not a toy, and she then implies that she wishes Moominmama had given it to her instead (I doubt she\u2019s actually interested much in the toy and that she\u2019s just jealous that he was given something and she wasn\u2019t - she says\u00a0\u201cthings can change\u201d when he says he\u2019s the one mama likes most).</p><p>Then, we see Moomintroll putting it in action on a little pond- er, puddle? Small pool? He wants it to turn clockwise a few times, so that\u00a0\u201ceverything will stay exactly the way it is\u201d (he started the episode stating that everything is perfect, after waving to Snufkin) And after he gets it to turn (by forcing it to with a stick), he sighs \u201ca long, hot summer with snufkiiin&hellip;\u201d until he sees that it\u2019s started turning anti-clockwise. In his futile attempts to make it turn clockwise, he ends up sinking the boat, and says\u00a0\u201cPah. Who believes in silly old signs, anyway?\u201d right before it starts pouring down with rain.</p><p>He runs to Snufkin, who tells him he\u2019s going\u00a0\u201cyonder\u201d, which he later says isn\u2019t so much a place, but a feeling.</p><p>Anyway, everything gets flooded, and the majority of the episode is spent with the Moomin family getting to know an eccentric theatre owner. At one point, Moomintroll says\u00a0\u201cwith a new wind in your sails, the wind of hope, you\u2019ll be able to sail through the whirlpools of life.\u201d</p><p>When they return to Moominvalley, and the rain has stopped, Snufkin is there waiting for them. He shows Moomintroll the bark boat, which is still turning anti-clockwise. Snufkin asks him if he thinks it\u2019s some sort of sign, to which he replies\u00a0\u201cNah, probably just the wind changing direction\u201d. Snufkin picks up the boat with a smile and takes it with him, and we see him holding it again during Moomintroll\u2019s rehearsal in the next episode.</p><h2>So&hellip; what does it mean? Specifically in regards to Moomintroll and Snufkin\u2019s relationship?</h2><p>Clearly, the series\u2019 theme of childhood &amp; growing up is present here, with the bark boat and the belief that the direction it turns could be a sign being an almost childish thing, so Moomintroll waving it off as just the wind at the end could be implying that he\u2019s grown up a little in this episode and learning to accept the natural changes and obstacles life throws at us (at one point Moominmama implies that life would be boring if things stayed perfectly the same all the time).</p><p>But what does this mean for his relationship with Snufkin? It could imply that they won\u2019t always be together; just like how he tried to change the direction of the boat, Moomintroll can\u2019t force Snufkin to be by his side forever, and it\u2019s inevitable that they\u2019ll be separated.</p><p>&hellip;However, I don\u2019t think this is the full picture because of Snufkin\u2019s appearance at the end; perhaps it is showing that they won\u2019t always be together, but eventually they will find their way back to each other - back <i>home again</i> - after they\u2019ve weathered storms of separation.</p><p>But I\u2019m personally not completely happy with that explanation since isn\u2019t that what their relationship already is? Being separated at winter then reuniting every spring? And why does Snufkin decide to keep the boat? On a cute surface level \n\nI guess him wanting to keep something that he knows belonged to Moomintroll shows he cherishes their relationship.</p><p>Boats usually symbolise a journey; and the whole\u00a0\u201cdirection/wind changing\u201d motif in this episode also reflects that; the journey of life has its ups and downs and its various changes, as does the relationship between the two characters.</p><p>So, ultimately, the bark boat symbolises Moomintroll\u2019s acceptance of this fact by letting it and his superstitions about it go, and Snufkin\u2019s acceptance of their relationship and the challenges it\u2019ll face by keeping the boat, therefore allowing himself to let Moomintroll in a bit more than he used to.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it took me typing out such a bloody long post to realise that conclusion but I\u2019m so happy if it is what the writers intended - Moomintroll being less possessive of and needy with Snufkin and Snufkin alternatively being with Moomintroll more &amp; thinking of his feelings (he hurt them by leaving the party early without telling him, for example) is EXACTLY what their relationship needs to be more healthy and better for everyone involved.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>I would LOVE to answer this question!! Sadly, I am not an expert. The tumblr user <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhgLxwA7G0bFodAqouVMa4g\">@moomintrivia</a> has a LOT of great and in-depth information about the topic that you should check out</p><p>So I\u2019m just going to give you a brief overview</p><p>The moomins are a fictional fairy-tale inspired race created by Tove Jansson. The first published instance of these characters occurred in the beloved Finnish children\u2019s novel \nThe Moomins and\nthe Great Flood, which was published in 1945. Since then, it grew into a nine book series, then a comic series, and then multiple TV adaptations.</p><p>It\u2019s always been wildly popular in Finland and Japan, but recently, a 3D TV adaptation called Moominvalley released earlier this year, inspiring a surge of fanart that began spreading moomin mania all across the internet.</p><p>Like you, I discovered it from seeing the fanart on my dashboard. I was first drawn to it because of the amazing character designs. Although I had never seen the characters before, I felt a huge wash of nostalgia looking at them. Plus, the soft \u201cliving in nature with a small but close community\u201d aesthetic really hooked me in.</p><p>I think a large part of its popularity is its setting and main family, the Moomins. They live in a sort of idealized world, where everyone in the community knows one another, and even though all the characters have their own flaws and annoying quirks, for the most part they accept one another. <br/></p><p>For example, Moominpappa loves telling dramatic stories, and he quickly gets bored with domestic life and routine. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Moominmamma is a family woman who really enjoys domestic life. Despite this seemingly incompatibility, they get along just fine. They go on the occasional unprompted trip to sate Moominpappa\u2019s wanderlust, and then once Moominpappa starts to miss the comforts of home, they return. <br/></p><p>Snufkin, too, is a character who is fueled by his need for freedom. He doesn\u2019t like being tied down, and especially hates privatized property, because he thinks that no one person should be allowed to hoard a piece of nature to themselves. His best friend is Moomintroll, who doesn\u2019t like to be left alone. Snufkin\u2019s need for solitude sometimes clashes with Moomintroll\u2019s desire to spend time with him, but neither character is villainized for their needs. They find ways to compromise, with Snufkin promising to spend three out of the four seasons of the year in Moominvalley. <br/></p><p>Little My, especially, is often affectionately called a \u201cgremlin\u201d by fans. She\u2019s a mischievous character, pulling pranks on people, and constantly trying to figure out everyone\u2019s secrets. Despite this, Little My is very much beloved by the Moomin family, who have more or less adopted her into the family.<br/></p><p>But the thing I love the most from the Moomins is the values they preach. Here are just a few to come to mind:</p><ul><li><p>\u201cEveryone has a right to having at least one secret.\u201d (Moominmamma, 1990 anime version)</p></li><li><p>\n\u201cThe world is full of great and wonderful things for those who are ready for them.\u201d\n\n(Moominpappa, from the books)</p></li><li><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ever be really free if you admire somebody too much, I know.\u201d\n(Snufkin, in several adaptations) <br/></p></li><li><p>\n\u201cBut one needs a change sometimes. We take everything too much for granted, including each other.\u201d\n\n(Moominmamma, from the books)</p></li><li><p>\u201cPerhaps I better not do that. I won\u2019t be able to appologize, because I\u2019m right.\u201d (Moominmamma, Moominvalley 2019)</p></li></ul><p>It\u2019s very much an optimistic, beautiful world, where tolerance is a huge reoccurring theme. Additionally, since Jansson herself was an anti-fascist woman who had relationships with both men and women, her work really resonates with modern-day queer people, who live in countries (like the USA) whose governments are becoming startlingly more and more fascist.</p><p>Or, put more simply, moomins are a free source of serotonin for those of us with extreme anxieties about the current state of the world. <br/></p>",

The tumblr user <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhgLxwA7G0bFodAqouVMa4g\">@moomintrivia</a> has a LOT of great and in-depth information about the topic that you should check out</p><p>So I\u2019m just going to give you a brief overview</p><p>The moomins are a fictional fairy-tale inspired race created by Tove Jansson. The first published instance of these characters occurred in the beloved Finnish children\u2019s novel \nThe Moomins and\nthe Great Flood, which was published in 1945. Since then, it grew into a nine book series, then a comic series, and then multiple TV adaptations.</p><p>It\u2019s always been wildly popular in Finland and Japan, but recently, a 3D TV adaptation called Moominvalley released earlier this year, inspiring a surge of fanart that began spreading moomin mania all across the internet.</p><p>Like you, I discovered it from seeing the fanart on my dashboard. I was first drawn to it because of the amazing character designs. Although I had never seen the characters before, I felt a huge wash of nostalgia looking at them. Plus, the soft \u201cliving in nature with a small but close community\u201d aesthetic really hooked me in.</p><p>I think a large part of its popularity is its setting and main family, the Moomins. They live in a sort of idealized world, where everyone in the community knows one another, and even though all the characters have their own flaws and annoying quirks, for the most part they accept one another. <br></p><p>For example, Moominpappa loves telling dramatic stories, and he quickly gets bored with domestic life and routine. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Moominmamma is a family woman who really enjoys domestic life. Despite this seemingly incompatibility, they get along just fine. They go on the occasional unprompted trip to sate Moominpappa\u2019s wanderlust, and then once Moominpappa starts to miss the comforts of home, they return. <br></p><p>Snufkin, too, is a character who is fueled by his need for freedom. He doesn\u2019t like being tied down, and especially hates privatized property, because he thinks that no one person should be allowed to hoard a piece of nature to themselves. His best friend is Moomintroll, who doesn\u2019t like to be left alone. Snufkin\u2019s need for solitude sometimes clashes with Moomintroll\u2019s desire to spend time with him, but neither character is villainized for their needs. They find ways to compromise, with Snufkin promising to spend three out of the four seasons of the year in Moominvalley. <br></p><p>Little My, especially, is often affectionately called a \u201cgremlin\u201d by fans. She\u2019s a mischievous character, pulling pranks on people, and constantly trying to figure out everyone\u2019s secrets. Despite this, Little My is very much beloved by the Moomin family, who have more or less adopted her into the family.<br></p><p>But the thing I love the most from the Moomins is the values they preach. Here are just a few to come to mind:</p><ul><li><p>\u201cEveryone has a right to having at least one secret.\u201d (Moominmamma, 1990 anime version)</p></li><li><p>\n\u201cThe world is full of great and wonderful things for those who are ready for them.\u201d\n\n(Moominpappa, from the books)</p></li><li><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ever be really free if you admire somebody too much, I know.\u201d\n(Snufkin, in several adaptations) <br></p></li><li><p>\n\u201cBut one needs a change sometimes. We take everything too much for granted, including each other.\u201d\n\n(Moominmamma, from the books)</p></li><li><p>\u201cPerhaps I better not do that.
