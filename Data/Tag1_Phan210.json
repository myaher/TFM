It\u2019s going fast. Faster than his brain can register. He only catches brief words. Capitalized sentences that he\u2019s learned from experience to not say out loud. It can be difficult not to, especially as he scans his brain for something interesting to say. He has been live for forty five minutes by now. He could easily announce tonight\u2019s top fans and take a couple last questions and call it a night. His eyes flit over his own face, where it\u2019s pixelated on the computer. He reminds himself to smile.</p><p>\u201cAlright, guys, well\u2026,\u201d Dan says to round up, but then he stalls at a question that catches his eye.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan where\u2019s Phil? Is he asleep?</i>\u201d he reads out loud as he clicks \u2018accept\u2019.</p><p>He chuckles, resting his chin on top of his fist.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re under the impression that Phil has any more semblance of a sleep schedule than me you would be very wrong,\u201d he says, then catches himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He could be sleeping, actually. I\u2019m not the only one that stays up until four am, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>Phil only stays up until four am if Dan\u2019s having a bad night and needs a distraction, he thinks but doesn\u2019t say. In recent years, Phil\u2019s personal limit had been two in the morning. Dan laughs to himself.</p><p>\u201cActually, the other night I\u2026 did something in my sleep,\u201d he continues, only realising he\u2019s saying it once he\u2019s started and stops himself in time to not go into details.</p><p>Wow. Is he doing this? The memory flashes back. Waking up from the feeling of Phil\u2019s long fingers scratching through his hair absentmindedly. Feeling completely satisfied and boneless, but not understanding why. Phil holding back his laughter as Dan slowly realised that he had started humping in his sleep like when he was teenager. This had been different from those lonely times. He hadn\u2019t woken up sweaty and ashamed on top of sticky sheets. This time he had another person there who had eagerly helped out with the problem.</p><p>\u201cOh come on,\u201d Dan berates as he sees a number of sexual comments. \u201cI sleepwalked. I don\u2019t remember it, honestly. Phil was in the lounge and I had walked to the kitchen or something.\u201d</p><p>More sexual comments. Dan laughs. It\u2019s the only way he\u2019s found to cover up his blushing. The web camera doesn\u2019t catch up on it really, but it feels like they can tell either way. The small laughs keep him from saying too much, makes it easier to lie.</p><p>\u201cAnyway I walked in there, and then I was just stood there like an idiot,\u201d Dan says. \u201cLike something out of a horror film. Phil had this momentary freak out because he thought if he woke me up I\u2019d go crazy.\u201d</p><p>Dan already regrets bringing it up. Phil will have to address it in his next live show. It could easily become a <i>thing</i> that people hold on to like so many other things had become during the years. So many unexpected topics and moments, constantly tweeted at them and talked about and for that sake become a permanent part of the Dan And Phil narrative.</p><p>Phil is better at biting his tongue. He doesn\u2019t talk on autopilot the same way Dan does. Dan just can\u2019t stop his train of thoughts. He makes decisions quickly, impulsively. He\u2019s better than he used to be, especially after him and Phil established some rules, but Dan\u2019s already overthinking and it\u2019s making him feel stupid.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I ended up going back to my room before he accidentally woke me up.\u201d Dan chuckles. \u201cPhil, the buffoon, would probably have managed to drop something and woke me up if I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The chat becomes impossibly faster. Slow chat mode is no match against 12,000 viewers that are always excited to hear about Phil. There goes the early exit. Dan enjoys it, though. He may not be able to say exactly what had happened, but it feels good to tell the audience about Phil\u2019s weird thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHe literally said the next day,\u201d Dan says, \u201cthat he\u2019d been scared to wake me because sleepwalkers go crazy when they\u2019re woken up in horror films. Is that a thing? Like, what actually happens when someone who sleepwalks wakes up? Is it bad?\u201d</p><p>He sees messages roll in.</p><p>\u201c<i>I used to sleepwalk and it was honestly terrifying</i>\u201d,</p><p>\u201c<i>My mum thought i was possessed by the amount of times she woke up seeing me stand at her bedside.</i>\u201d</p><p>Dan reads out the second message.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s some supernatural shit. That\u2019s what Phil used to do as a child too. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve put myself at risk living with him.\u201d</p><p>Dan reads more messages, different theories and personal anecdotes coming in droves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna google it,\u201d Dan says eventually.</p><p>He types it in the google search and hits enter.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here we go.\u201d</p><p>He furrows his brow as he reads. The first result makes no sense.</p><p>\u201c<i>It is a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because it may cause them a heart attack, shock, brain damage, or something else. It is not a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because of the possible injury the sleepwalker may inflict upon themselves or the person waking them up</i>,\u201d he reads quickly.</p><p>He makes a face as he processes the information.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he splutters. \u201cIs it a myth or not? Make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the source.</p><p>\u201c<i>The Register</i>. Yeah. Get your facts straight. I read the first google result and I expect to be fully informed by the first hit, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>He grins at his own joke. He accepts one of the premium messages.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan, they mean that while it may not cause any physical or emotional reaction it could be unsafe as the sleepwalker might be in a compromising position. Fall down or be holding something they could accidentally injure themselves with. I know because I once woke my sister up from sleepwalking and she almost fell down a flight of stairs.</i>\u201d</p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully as he reads it out.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cI totally interpreted that wrong, then. That does sound quite harrowing. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t wake me up.\u201d</p><p>Dan has to let out a small laugh. Lying in bed is not technically sleepwalking, and if Phil had woken him up there would have been no risk of Dan accidentally injuring himself. It was a stupid topic to bring up, but it actually is starting to interest him.</p><p>He spends another few minutes looking up results and reading some of the viewers\u2019 experiences. He ignores the messages that are worried about his health, advising him to go to bed on time and other solutions he\u2019s heard a million times before that would effectively improve his quality of sleep. He\u2019s not exactly bothered by it, he just doesn\u2019t think it applies to his situation. It had only been a wet dream after all.</p><p>He caves by reading someone\u2019s message that says they hope he\u2019s okay and trying his best to sleep better.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Dan says. \u201cThat was a week ago and it hasn\u2019t happened since. No more possessed-Dan scenarios for Phil.\u201d</p><p>He drops the topic and goes on to read out the top fans. He doesn\u2019t take any last messages or question, he just thanks the viewers for watching. He tells them to drink some water, get out in the sun, and to remember to take a few moments to breathe. He smiles, says goodbye, and clicks the \u201con air\u201d button. Afterwards he quietly checks to see if he\u2019s really off air. He puts the piece of tape back over his webcam and turns off the mic function on his computer. Might be a bit much, but the idea of accidentally staying live scares him enough to repeat that process after every liveshow.</p><p>He types a tweet thanking people for tuning in and posts it. He reads some of the replies that roll in. Someone\u2019s already quoted the whole sleepwalking scenario. He closes the laptop and sits in silence. Not long after he feels two hands come to squeeze his shoulders.</p><p>He leans his head back until it bumps Phil\u2019s stomach. Keeps it there while Phil massages him gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing you in the kitchen,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan sighs.</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hands work his shoulders steadily. Then his fingers come to softly slide up and down Dan\u2019s neck. He shudders visibly. His head immediately shifts. Something about the touch is always too much, always right between arousal and oversensitivity. But the fingers go further, pet into Dan\u2019s hair. Phil pulls his head back so that Dan looks at him.</p><p>Phil is in his pyjamas, hair pushed back, glasses on. He leans down and kisses Dan\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cBeen thinking about that night, have you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Dan smiles. He remembers that boneless feeling. How urgent Phil\u2019s erection had been in his hand. How it felt, stiff in his mouth. Something about tired sex was such a relief. The body hasn\u2019t tensed with the stress of a work day yet. The mind hasn\u2019t fully registered the environment. It hasn\u2019t recollected the thoughts that worried it the night before. It\u2019s easier to listen to your body, to go with it. To let yourself be handled by the man in your bed.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Phil goes to sit on the bed. He pats his hand next to him and Dan immediately gets up for the silent invitation. He sits next to Phil and lets himself be touched. Over the shirt, squeezing one of Dan\u2019s pecks. They kiss.</p><p>\u201cI take it you have,\u201d Dan teases.</p><p>\u201cThe way you just fucked into me,\u201d Phil recollects. \u201cSenselessly, all taken with it. It amused me at first, but then it was this weird combination of cute and hot at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute?\u201d Dan questions. \u201cYou want me to be cute in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>His hand is still rubbing over Dan\u2019s chest. Completely just feeling him up, taking. Dan\u2019s used to it. Phil can\u2019t keep his hands to himself and he hasn\u2019t since they first met. It\u2019s still effective. Dan is half hard and leaning into the touches.</p><p>\u201cIt was innocent,\u201d Phil elaborates. \u201cInnocent but at the same time, not at all. You were so needy for it even though you didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dan says, smirk creeping onto his face. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you I\u2019ll do that in bed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil shrugs. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Anything you do is cute. And hot.\u201d</p><p>Dan has learned to accept that \u2018cute\u2019 is a good thing in reference to himself. He despised that word for a long time. How his mum would patronizingly call him that well into his upper teens, while he was struggling with his identity and his masculinity. It wasn\u2019t until Phil started to say it that it felt good. Made him feel\u2026 precious, in a way.</p><p>\u201cAm I cute when I suck your dick?\u201d Dan teases.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Phil sounds as he kisses Dan deeper. \u201cSuper cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Dan\u2019s breath goes hot. \u201cMe with your tip in my mouth, have to ask for help? Until you get frustrated and fuck my mouth deep and come down my cute little throat?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, breathing hard. He chuckles a little bit.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that so hot coming out of your mouth?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan grins. He puts his hand on Phil\u2019s crotch over his pyjama bottoms. \u201cOh, you\u2019re hard there. Why are you? What happens if I..?\u201d</p><p>Dan squeezes softly. Phil\u2019s hips automatically thrust into the touch.</p><p>\u201cUngh,\u201d he moans, as if in pain, against Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dan asks, playing hard into a sweet, gullible voice. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Dan,\u201d Phil says, putting his hand on top of Dan\u2019s between his legs. He pushes Dan\u2019s hand down harder. \u201cYou little tease. It feels amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan says. \u201cThen what happens if I..?\u201d</p><p>He slips his hand under Phil\u2019s bottoms and softly touches his cock. He\u2019s not wearing any pants underneath. A drop of precum rolls down his shaft. Dan smooths his thumb over it, then pretends to be shocked.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Dan says. \u201cAre you peeing?\u201d</p><p>He still keeps his hand steady there. Phil groans, pushes on top of Dan until he\u2019s lying down on top of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo, babe,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means you\u2019re doing well. Feels so good.\u201d</p><p>Phil stutters as he says it. He seems so deliciously apprehensive, exploring this type of dirty talk. Like he\u2019s ashamed of liking it. Dan loves those kind of kinks the most. How he has to almost convince Phil that it\u2019s okay, that it\u2019s play.</p><p>\u201cOh it does?\u201d Dan says, filling his voice with wonder. He squeezes a bit more. \u201cThat feels good?\u201d</p><p>Phil makes another almost pained noise. He pulls Dan\u2019s hand off of his cock, out his bottoms. He throws his T-shirt off and pins Dan\u2019s wrists down on top of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dan asks, eyes big.</p><p>\u201cThought you needed a lesson on teasing,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>The pressure of Phil on top of him is somethin Dan will never get used to. How the heavy body keeps him still. How those big hands tighten around his wrists. Dan keens at the sensation, can\u2019t keep up the pretense of not understanding when his cock is so hard. Phil fumbles out his bottoms and pulls Dan\u2019s T-shirt off over his head, then immediately returns to their original position.</p><p>\u201cMakes me wanna fuck you so bad,\u201d Phil breathes onto Dan\u2019s neck before he nips at the skin, pushing their cocks together.</p><p>Only the thin layer off cotton provided by Dan\u2019s joggers keep them from fully touching. Dan moans, voice pitching higher than normal.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says as his eyes shut. So many sensations. \u201cI feel weird down there. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel weird, do you?\u201d Phil asks, gruff voice against Dan\u2019s neck. \u201cHow could that be? Describe it to me\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Apparently Dan\u2019s not the only one that can tease. Phil pulls his hips back, refusing to grind them down. Dan looks up at him desperately. He needs that push.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Phil grins, studying Dan\u2019s frustrated expression. \u201cIf you feel weird we might have take you to hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Phil,\u201d Dan breaks. It slips like a whisper out of his mouth.</p><p>Phil laughs again, low and inhibited. That fucking laugh. Dan loves it. He loves it during sex especially.</p><p>\u201cIt feels\u2026,\u201d Dan moans. \u201cFeels like a pressure. Really hard down there. I think my cock is getting stiff like yours. Can you take a look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, and pulls Dan\u2019s soft bottoms down and off swiftly.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cock stands up, pink and hard. Phil lies next to Dan and just <i>looks</i> at it. Doesn\u2019t touch. Dan blinks up at Phil\u2019s face, then down at his own throbbing erection.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Phil says. \u201cTell me how it feels.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand around it. Doesn\u2019t squeeze, just holds it.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hips push into Phil\u2019s hold. Fuck. This is so weird and good at the same time.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says. \u201cIt feels.. Oh, Phil. It feels good. It feels like you should do it more. <i>Harder</i>.\u201d</p><p>The last word is more of a command, more of Dan\u2019s normal voice. He needs Phil to just\u2026 stop fucking around and get to it. Phil is having way too much fun.</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>His hand slides easily up to the tip. He thumbs the slit of Dan\u2019s foreskin.</p><p>Dan moans low at that, hips going wild for a second to chase the feeling.</p><p>\u201cEasy does it,\u201d Phil says, and stills Dan\u2019s hips with a strong hand.</p><p>He comes back to Dan\u2019s cock once he\u2019s stopped moving. He slides it up and down, too light, too soft. Dan shivers against the touch. He can\u2019t help but bury his face in Phil\u2019s neck. So warm there, so close. He needs to get closer. Phil keeps up the light, slow pace. Dan rolls into Phil\u2019s side, fucks into Phil\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cFeels really good,\u201d Dan sighs.</p><p>His hips go steady with the pace. Slow, slow. He lets his hand wander down to grasp Phil\u2019s stiff cock in his hand. He matches Phil\u2019s pace.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Phil sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s my good boy.\u201d</p><p>Dan breathes hard against Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he asks as he gently thumbs at the head. \u201cA-am I doing it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo right,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan pretends to search, unsure. Presses at the head. Drags his hand slowly down Phil\u2019s length. Phil\u2019s hips begin to move in a similar pace to Dan\u2019s. They eventually just end up pushing into each other\u2019s fists. Lazy, slow. Dan looks up from the comfort of Phil\u2019s neck and kisses his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d Phil says once they part. \u201cSo pretty for me.\u201d</p><p>It resonates in Dan, makes him go faster into Phil\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, sweetie?\u201d he asks, stealing another chaste kiss. \u201cLike it when I call you that?\u201d</p><p>Dan moans.</p><p>\u201cNhyes,\u201d he whines. \u201cPlease. Say it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d look real pretty with my cock in your mouth,\u201d Phil says, voice low.</p><p>Dan pretends to be taken aback.</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d he asks, looking down at Phil\u2019s cock, still moving into Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>He removes the hand and presses a finger to his bottom lip. He sucks at it, tastes some of Phil.</p><p>\u201cOhh yes,\u201d Phil says. \u201cThat mouth is so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou taste good.\u201d</p><p>Phil groans, taken out of it a bit again. Stepping closer to that edge of shame. Dan just wants to savour that look on his face that doubts what they\u2019re doing. Whether it\u2019s hot and kinky or just weird. Phil removes his hand from around Dan\u2019s cock and pets Dan\u2019s cheek before he fingers through Dan\u2019s hair and starts to push him down forcefully.</p><p>Dan goes with it, stops when his face is level with Phil\u2019s dick. He takes a measuring look. Up and down, hesitant. He looks up at Phil for guidance.</p><p>\u201cJust,\u201d Phil takes his cock in hand and guides it to Dan\u2019s mouth. \u201cSuck. Right there on the tip.\u201d</p><p>Dan keeps his eyes big, expression confused and wondrous as he looks at Phil\u2019s cock. It\u2019s leaking and hard. Then he closes his mouth softly around the head. Wet suction noises fill the room before he pulls off with a loud pop.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>Phil is positively vibrating with want. He slides his cock over Dan\u2019s now closed lips.</p><p>\u201cJuuust like that,\u201d Phil encourages. \u201cTake it in your mouth, babe.\u201d</p><p>Dan resumes, sucking hesitantly. Never moving his head, just sucking right at that same spot. He pulls off, licks a little with a teasing smile. He sinks back down. Sucking hard, alternating by lolling his tongue over the tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Phil groans. \u201cTake it deeper.\u201d</p><p>Dan pretends not to understand. He keeps at what he\u2019s been doing, just to see Phil\u2019s increasing frustration make him weak with arousal. He puts his hand on Dan\u2019s head while he sucks and pushes him down slowly. Dan whines against it. The feeling of Phil\u2019s hand, strong and domineering in his hair, just taking everything. He sucks obediently. Phil pulls Dan up and down his cock by the hair.</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d Phil says. \u201cCan you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>He lets go of Dan\u2019s hair and watches. Dan really wants to take Phil deep, let him hit the back of his throat. He wants to make Phil come so bad. But he pulls off again, resumes his suckling on the tip, alternating by licks. He knows it\u2019s not nearly enough. He knows it\u2019s agony, to be teetering on the edge of something and for it not to follow through. To not get that pressure. He waits until Phil is a whimpering, thrusting mess.</p><p>Dan pulls off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks. \u201cAm I doing it wrong?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, not as an answer, but simply as a sign of disbelief and exasperation. He grabs Dan by the hair again.</p><p>\u201cJust fucking take it,\u201d he grunts and feeds his cock deep into Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p>In one swift movement, Phil\u2019s cock hits the back of Dan\u2019s throat. Dan gags loudly, eyes tearing up, but lets himself adjust to the sudden intrusion. It\u2019s different when Phil is the one commanding a deep throat. When Dan does it himself he has no problems. It\u2019s like he\u2019s made for it, not a hint of a gag reflex as he swallows Phil down deep and stays there, steadily breathing through his nose while Phil falls apart beneath him. No, this is different, and the sudden sound of a gag makes Phil\u2019s body shake with pleasure as he stares down at Dan.</p><p>Dan breaks the eye contact, cock still lodged down his throat, and whines pathetically around it. Phil pulls Dan\u2019s hair so that his mouth slides up and off his cock completely. Dan breathes shallowly through his mouth. A string of spit still connects Dan\u2019s bottom lip to the tip of Phil\u2019s cock.</p><p>Without saying anything, Phil pulls Dan\u2019s mouth onto his cock again and thrusts just as deeply into it. Dan doesn\u2019t gag this time, but there\u2019s still that unholy wet sound like a <i>click</i> as the head of Phil\u2019s cock settles deep there. Dan is practically shaking with satisfaction. Phil is so fucking hard and unforgiving by the way he just takes. He\u2019s using Dan like a toy. That doesn\u2019t happen frequently but in certain moments, like this one, it\u2019s perfect for both of them.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Phil instructs.</p><p>His voice is strained. Dan looks up at Phil curiously, eyes still a bit wet from before. He blinks. Phil gasps as soon as their eyes lock. Another squelching sound from the back of Dan\u2019s throat as Phil\u2019s hips pull back a bit and push back in. Just an involuntary movement caused by the horny twitch of his hips. Phil moans, breath quickening a bit, as if he doesn\u2019t trust himself to be able to hold back anymore.</p><p>But he does. He pulls his cock out fully one more time and allows Dan to cough and clear his throat. Dan\u2019s overdoing it for the sake of teasing Phil. He\u2019s mastered the art of sucking dick since the time that that was the only thing they allowed themselves to do back in the day. The pretend coughs still work, though. Dan feels Phil\u2019s wet cock slide against the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Phil murmurs affectionately. \u201cThat\u2019s how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so big,\u201d he says and fakes an impossibly innocent expression on his face.</p><p>He moves his head softly to mouth at the shaft. Phil shudders yet again.</p><p>\u201cYou like that down your throat, huh?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>Dan nods wordlessly, eyes closing as he loses himself into the soft kisses he places on Phil\u2019s length. It\u2019s a stark contrast. Phil\u2019s cock is hard to the point that he could come immediately from the simple fast stroke of Dan\u2019s hand. Yet Dan keeps mouthing the side softly, like he has all the time in the world to leisurely explore every inch of it.</p><p>\u201cMmh feels nice,\u201d Phil says, voice hoarse. \u201cLook so nice too.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks back up at that, eyes crinkling with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo cute when you take my cock,\u201d Phil continues.</p><p>His hands tighten in Dan\u2019s hair again. Pulls him away from his cock, but not far. He guides him to the tip, still not touching, and holds still.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cock is trapped between his stomach and the mattress underneath. He\u2019s about to bust at just that one adjective, the one that\u2019s so strangely erotic within the context of sex.</p><p><i>Cute.</i></p><p>Dan breathes hard down onto Phil\u2019s cock and swallows, expecting his mouth to be filled at any second. Phil stalls long enough for Dan to look up eventually.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says throatily as their eyes meet. \u201cCan I just fuck your throat and go buckwild?\u201d</p><p>Dan breathes in a ragged breath, eyes closing in an attempt to dull the pure need rippling through his body at the question. He has to laugh though. A short giggle, and his lips accidentally pillow on top of Phil\u2019s leaking slit.</p><p>\u201c<i>Buckwild</i>,\u201d he imitates through a grin and pulls back a bit. \u201cWhat is this, a rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeehaw,\u201d Phil says weakly.</p><p>They lose it at that. Phil\u2019s hand disappears from Dan\u2019s hair and Dan\u2019s face slumps down to muffle his giggles against the soft skin in the crease between Phil\u2019s ball sack and leg. He looks up at Phil whose hands are fully covering his mouth, eyes glistening with laughter.</p><p>Phil shakes his head, hands coming undone from his mouth. One returns downward to pet the side of Dan\u2019s head and the other lies flat against the bed. Phil slumps his head down on the mattress and stares up at the ceiling as he breathes laboured breaths to stop from laughing. Dan\u2019s body is still shaking with it, but it slows as he pushes into Phil\u2019s gentle hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d Phil ponders aloud, another giggle escaping his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d Dan murmurs, regaining some sense of reality.</p><p>The reality is that Phil\u2019s erection is still as urgent and it\u2019s poking at Dan\u2019s cheek and that is so hot he forgets to laugh anymore.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil replies, pushing himself up onto his elbow in order to look at Dan. \u201cI hate how hot it is.\u201d</p><p>Dan mouths at Phil\u2019s shaft again. Slowly, leisurely.</p><p>\u201cDo I look cute?\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Phil moans.</p><p>The gentle hand comes powerful into Dan\u2019s hair again, guiding his lips to slide up and down the side of his cock. Dan breathes hard.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan sighs. \u201cYes, fuck my mouth.\u201d</p><p>He breathes another sigh as his mouth slides with more urgency just by the demanding force of Phil\u2019s hand in his hair.</p><p>\u201cGo <i>buckwild</i>,\u201d Dan says, shooting a pointed look up at Phil.</p><p>Phil stretches his lips and bites the inside of his mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck your throat so hard that I come any second and that is not a laughing matter,\u201d he says, mouth stretching wider as he struggles harder to keep his word.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan moans exaggeratedly. \u201cNeed to taste that cum.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s expression turns serious at that. He pulls Dan into the same position as before. Mouth just above his cock, begging to be stuffed full. Dan clears his throat and swallows, readying himself for what\u2019s to come. They lock eyes for a moment before Phil finally pulls Dan\u2019s head down and thrusts his hips up, creating a perfect, fast slide deep into Dan\u2019s tight throat.</p><p>He keeps Dan\u2019s head down for a few seconds as he fucks into that sweet spot right at the back of Dan\u2019s throat. Dan moans, voice almost lost, but the sound mixed with the wet squelch created by Phil repeatedly fucking into him creates an even rawer noise that makes Dan\u2019s cock twitch and leak where it\u2019s trapped and neglected against the mattress. Phil pulls Dan\u2019s head back, not completely off this time, and repeats the process. Each time it goes faster. Dan\u2019s nose right in the trail of hair at the small pudge of Phil\u2019s stomach. Phil sounds a string of desperate breaths, completely taken by sensation.</p><p>\u201cGonna fucking come,\u201d he strains to say, \u201cso fucking hard down your pretty little throat, gonna fill it up \u2018til it spills right over with all that nasty cum.\u201d</p><p>Dan is really about to come untouched at those words. He inhales hard. Lets Phil keep going, going, going until he reaches that wonderful edge and floods Dan\u2019s mouth with the promised cum. Phil pulls back at that, and fucks shallowly into Dan\u2019s mouth as he spills and spills, a hard breath exhaled through his mouth. When his tense muscles eventually relax he moves Dan\u2019s mouth off his now oversensitive cock.</p><p>Dan breathes hard through his nose. Phil\u2019s hand pets him sweetly again, tilts Dan\u2019s chin up a bit to get a proper look.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan opens his mouth, shows off the pearly white cum that pools on his wet little tongue. Some of it spills down his chin. Dan closes his mouth and swallows, eyes soft up at Phil\u2019s. Phil traces the tiny wad of cum that slipped out, pushes it against Dan\u2019s skin as he guides it back into his mouth. Dan sucks gently at it and swallows.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good mouthful, babe,\u201d Phil sighs.</p><p>Dan is practically vibrating with the need to come. He pulls himself up on top of Phil fast and crashes his used mouth onto Phil\u2019s lips. Phil wraps his arm around Dan and moans.</p><p>\u201cNeedy little boy,\u201d Phil says. \u201cDo you maybe need to come?\u201d</p><p>Dan collects himself a bit. The feeling of finally being able to slide his cock over Phil\u2019s stomach and getting some relief is going to make him crazy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he responds. \u201cA little bit.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggles a laugh, but before long his hand pushes down between their bodies and wraps around Dan\u2019s dick. He squeezes tightly, just like Dan loves, and moves it slowly up and down. Dan whines, head falling onto Phil\u2019s neck as he desperately chases relief.</p><p>\u201cSo good for me,\u201d Phil murmurs against Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cGonna make you come all cute and warm on me.\u201d</p><p>Dan trembles. He fucks harder into Phil\u2019s fist in time with his movements. The slide becomes looser, faster up and down Dan now that he\u2019s close. Fast rhythmic thrusts pause into a stutter, a moment of stillness, as Dan\u2019s body tightens up completely and he finds himself biting down on Phil\u2019s neck. Then bliss overcomes him. Such wonderful relief, as all that tension and almost-shame that caused his arousal in the first place leaves him. Cum squirts all over Phil\u2019s stomach messily as he rides out the orgasm through high pitched moans and pathetic pumps of his hips.</p><p>Dan slumps on Phil\u2019s side, head coming to rest on his arm. He breathes hard for a bit. His dick is softening but still sensitive. Phil\u2019s hand is still there though, like a reassurance, almost an apology for not having touched it more during this. Dan smiles to himself at the thought.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re awful,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>He turns to lie on his side and face Dan. They look into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely filthy,\u201d Dan agrees. \u201cWhat would Kathryn say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Phil warns, staring.</p><p>It isn\u2019t unlike Dan to bring up either the most gruesome, innocent, or completely off-limit things during what\u2019s supposed to be the lovely afterglow of an orgasm. He can\u2019t help himself. Not when he\u2019s this loose and giddy and the words cause such a blunt reaction from Phil. He giggles, gives Phil a quick peck on the lips.</p><p>His hand comes down to touch Phil\u2019s cock again. It\u2019s softened completely. Dan looks into Phil\u2019s eyes with a devilish smirk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of your mum,\u201d he says quickly before he crashes his mouth on Phil\u2019s and licks into it, wet tongues clashing together in a completely impure kiss.</p><p>Phil pulls away laughing. He shakes his head and ruffles Dan\u2019s hair playfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you a hundred times to not start with that again,\u201d he complains.</p><p>Dan laughs heartily.

It\u2019s going fast. Faster than his brain can register. He only catches brief words. Capitalized sentences that he\u2019s learned from experience to not say out loud. It can be difficult not to, especially as he scans his brain for something interesting to say. He has been live for forty five minutes by now. He could easily announce tonight\u2019s top fans and take a couple last questions and call it a night. His eyes flit over his own face, where it\u2019s pixelated on the computer. He reminds himself to smile.</p><p>\u201cAlright, guys, well\u2026,\u201d Dan says to round up, but then he stalls at a question that catches his eye.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan where\u2019s Phil? Is he asleep?</i>\u201d he reads out loud as he clicks \u2018accept\u2019.</p><p>He chuckles, resting his chin on top of his fist.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re under the impression that Phil has any more semblance of a sleep schedule than me you would be very wrong,\u201d he says, then catches himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He could be sleeping, actually. I\u2019m not the only one that stays up until four am, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>Phil only stays up until four am if Dan\u2019s having a bad night and needs a distraction, he thinks but doesn\u2019t say. In recent years, Phil\u2019s personal limit had been two in the morning. Dan laughs to himself.</p><p>\u201cActually, the other night I\u2026 did something in my sleep,\u201d he continues, only realising he\u2019s saying it once he\u2019s started and stops himself in time to not go into details.</p><p>Wow. Is he doing this? The memory flashes back. Waking up from the feeling of Phil\u2019s long fingers scratching through his hair absentmindedly. Feeling completely satisfied and boneless, but not understanding why. Phil holding back his laughter as Dan slowly realised that he had started humping in his sleep like when he was teenager. This had been different from those lonely times. He hadn\u2019t woken up sweaty and ashamed on top of sticky sheets. This time he had another person there who had eagerly helped out with the problem.</p><p>\u201cOh come on,\u201d Dan berates as he sees a number of sexual comments. \u201cI sleepwalked. I don\u2019t remember it, honestly. Phil was in the lounge and I had walked to the kitchen or something.\u201d</p><p>More sexual comments. Dan laughs. It\u2019s the only way he\u2019s found to cover up his blushing. The web camera doesn\u2019t catch up on it really, but it feels like they can tell either way. The small laughs keep him from saying too much, makes it easier to lie.</p><p>\u201cAnyway I walked in there, and then I was just stood there like an idiot,\u201d Dan says. \u201cLike something out of a horror film. Phil had this momentary freak out because he thought if he woke me up I\u2019d go crazy.\u201d</p><p>Dan already regrets bringing it up. Phil will have to address it in his next live show. It could easily become a <i>thing</i> that people hold on to like so many other things had become during the years. So many unexpected topics and moments, constantly tweeted at them and talked about and for that sake become a permanent part of the Dan And Phil narrative.</p><p>Phil is better at biting his tongue. He doesn\u2019t talk on autopilot the same way Dan does. Dan just can\u2019t stop his train of thoughts. He makes decisions quickly, impulsively. He\u2019s better than he used to be, especially after him and Phil established some rules, but Dan\u2019s already overthinking and it\u2019s making him feel stupid.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I ended up going back to my room before he accidentally woke me up.\u201d Dan chuckles. \u201cPhil, the buffoon, would probably have managed to drop something and woke me up if I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The chat becomes impossibly faster. Slow chat mode is no match against 12,000 viewers that are always excited to hear about Phil. There goes the early exit. Dan enjoys it, though. He may not be able to say exactly what had happened, but it feels good to tell the audience about Phil\u2019s weird thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHe literally said the next day,\u201d Dan says, \u201cthat he\u2019d been scared to wake me because sleepwalkers go crazy when they\u2019re woken up in horror films. Is that a thing? Like, what actually happens when someone who sleepwalks wakes up? Is it bad?\u201d</p><p>He sees messages roll in.</p><p>\u201c<i>I used to sleepwalk and it was honestly terrifying</i>\u201d,</p><p>\u201c<i>My mum thought i was possessed by the amount of times she woke up seeing me stand at her bedside.</i>\u201d</p><p>Dan reads out the second message.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s some supernatural shit. That\u2019s what Phil used to do as a child too. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve put myself at risk living with him.\u201d</p><p>Dan reads more messages, different theories and personal anecdotes coming in droves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna google it,\u201d Dan says eventually.</p><p>He types it in the google search and hits enter.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here we go.\u201d</p><p>He furrows his brow as he reads. The first result makes no sense.</p><p>\u201c<i>It is a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because it may cause them a heart attack, shock, brain damage, or something else. It is not a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because of the possible injury the sleepwalker may inflict upon themselves or the person waking them up</i>,\u201d he reads quickly.</p><p>He makes a face as he processes the information.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he splutters. \u201cIs it a myth or not? Make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the source.</p><p>\u201c<i>The Register</i>. Yeah. Get your facts straight. I read the first google result and I expect to be fully informed by the first hit, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>He grins at his own joke. He accepts one of the premium messages.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan, they mean that while it may not cause any physical or emotional reaction it could be unsafe as the sleepwalker might be in a compromising position. Fall down or be holding something they could accidentally injure themselves with. I know because I once woke my sister up from sleepwalking and she almost fell down a flight of stairs.</i>\u201d</p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully as he reads it out.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cI totally interpreted that wrong, then. That does sound quite harrowing. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t wake me up.\u201d</p><p>Dan has to let out a small laugh. Lying in bed is not technically sleepwalking, and if Phil had woken him up there would have been no risk of Dan accidentally injuring himself. It was a stupid topic to bring up, but it actually is starting to interest him.</p><p>He spends another few minutes looking up results and reading some of the viewers\u2019 experiences. He ignores the messages that are worried about his health, advising him to go to bed on time and other solutions he\u2019s heard a million times before that would effectively improve his quality of sleep. He\u2019s not exactly bothered by it, he just doesn\u2019t think it applies to his situation. It had only been a wet dream after all.</p><p>He caves by reading someone\u2019s message that says they hope he\u2019s okay and trying his best to sleep better.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Dan says. \u201cThat was a week ago and it hasn\u2019t happened since. No more possessed-Dan scenarios for Phil.\u201d</p><p>He drops the topic and goes on to read out the top fans. He doesn\u2019t take any last messages or question, he just thanks the viewers for watching. He tells them to drink some water, get out in the sun, and to remember to take a few moments to breathe. He smiles, says goodbye, and clicks the \u201con air\u201d button. Afterwards he quietly checks to see if he\u2019s really off air. He puts the piece of tape back over his webcam and turns off the mic function on his computer. Might be a bit much, but the idea of accidentally staying live scares him enough to repeat that process after every liveshow.</p><p>He types a tweet thanking people for tuning in and posts it. He reads some of the replies that roll in. Someone\u2019s already quoted the whole sleepwalking scenario. He closes the laptop and sits in silence. Not long after he feels two hands come to squeeze his shoulders.</p><p>He leans his head back until it bumps Phil\u2019s stomach. Keeps it there while Phil massages him gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing you in the kitchen,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan sighs.</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hands work his shoulders steadily. Then his fingers come to softly slide up and down Dan\u2019s neck. He shudders visibly. His head immediately shifts. Something about the touch is always too much, always right between arousal and oversensitivity. But the fingers go further, pet into Dan\u2019s hair. Phil pulls his head back so that Dan looks at him.</p><p>Phil is in his pyjamas, hair pushed back, glasses on. He leans down and kisses Dan\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cBeen thinking about that night, have you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Dan smiles. He remembers that boneless feeling. How urgent Phil\u2019s erection had been in his hand. How it felt, stiff in his mouth. Something about tired sex was such a relief. The body hasn\u2019t tensed with the stress of a work day yet. The mind hasn\u2019t fully registered the environment. It hasn\u2019t recollected the thoughts that worried it the night before. It\u2019s easier to listen to your body, to go with it. To let yourself be handled by the man in your bed.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Phil goes to sit on the bed. He pats his hand next to him and Dan immediately gets up for the silent invitation. He sits next to Phil and lets himself be touched. Over the shirt, squeezing one of Dan\u2019s pecks. They kiss.</p><p>\u201cI take it you have,\u201d Dan teases.</p><p>\u201cThe way you just fucked into me,\u201d Phil recollects. \u201cSenselessly, all taken with it. It amused me at first, but then it was this weird combination of cute and hot at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute?\u201d Dan questions. \u201cYou want me to be cute in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>His hand is still rubbing over Dan\u2019s chest. Completely just feeling him up, taking. Dan\u2019s used to it. Phil can\u2019t keep his hands to himself and he hasn\u2019t since they first met. It\u2019s still effective. Dan is half hard and leaning into the touches.</p><p>\u201cIt was innocent,\u201d Phil elaborates. \u201cInnocent but at the same time, not at all. You were so needy for it even though you didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dan says, smirk creeping onto his face. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you I\u2019ll do that in bed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil shrugs. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Anything you do is cute. And hot.\u201d</p><p>Dan has learned to accept that \u2018cute\u2019 is a good thing in reference to himself. He despised that word for a long time. How his mum would patronizingly call him that well into his upper teens, while he was struggling with his identity and his masculinity. It wasn\u2019t until Phil started to say it that it felt good. Made him feel\u2026 precious, in a way.</p><p>\u201cAm I cute when I suck your dick?\u201d Dan teases.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Phil sounds as he kisses Dan deeper. \u201cSuper cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Dan\u2019s breath goes hot. \u201cMe with your tip in my mouth, have to ask for help? Until you get frustrated and fuck my mouth deep and come down my cute little throat?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, breathing hard. He chuckles a little bit.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that so hot coming out of your mouth?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan grins. He puts his hand on Phil\u2019s crotch over his pyjama bottoms. \u201cOh, you\u2019re hard there. Why are you? What happens if I..?\u201d</p><p>Dan squeezes softly. Phil\u2019s hips automatically thrust into the touch.</p><p>\u201cUngh,\u201d he moans, as if in pain, against Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dan asks, playing hard into a sweet, gullible voice. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Dan,\u201d Phil says, putting his hand on top of Dan\u2019s between his legs. He pushes Dan\u2019s hand down harder. \u201cYou little tease. It feels amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan says. \u201cThen what happens if I..?\u201d</p><p>He slips his hand under Phil\u2019s bottoms and softly touches his cock. He\u2019s not wearing any pants underneath. A drop of precum rolls down his shaft. Dan smooths his thumb over it, then pretends to be shocked.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Dan says. \u201cAre you peeing?\u201d</p><p>He still keeps his hand steady there. Phil groans, pushes on top of Dan until he\u2019s lying down on top of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo, babe,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means you\u2019re doing well. Feels so good.\u201d</p><p>Phil stutters as he says it. He seems so deliciously apprehensive, exploring this type of dirty talk. Like he\u2019s ashamed of liking it. Dan loves those kind of kinks the most. How he has to almost convince Phil that it\u2019s okay, that it\u2019s play.</p><p>\u201cOh it does?\u201d Dan says, filling his voice with wonder. He squeezes a bit more. \u201cThat feels good?\u201d</p><p>Phil makes another almost pained noise. He pulls Dan\u2019s hand off of his cock, out his bottoms. He throws his T-shirt off and pins Dan\u2019s wrists down on top of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dan asks, eyes big.</p><p>\u201cThought you needed a lesson on teasing,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>The pressure of Phil on top of him is somethin Dan will never get used to. How the heavy body keeps him still. How those big hands tighten around his wrists. Dan keens at the sensation, can\u2019t keep up the pretense of not understanding when his cock is so hard. Phil fumbles out his bottoms and pulls Dan\u2019s T-shirt off over his head, then immediately returns to their original position.</p><p>\u201cMakes me wanna fuck you so bad,\u201d Phil breathes onto Dan\u2019s neck before he nips at the skin, pushing their cocks together.</p><p>Only the thin layer off cotton provided by Dan\u2019s joggers keep them from fully touching. Dan moans, voice pitching higher than normal.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says as his eyes shut. So many sensations. \u201cI feel weird down there. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel weird, do you?\u201d Phil asks, gruff voice against Dan\u2019s neck. \u201cHow could that be? Describe it to me\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Apparently Dan\u2019s not the only one that can tease. Phil pulls his hips back, refusing to grind them down. Dan looks up at him desperately. He needs that push.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Phil grins, studying Dan\u2019s frustrated expression. \u201cIf you feel weird we might have take you to hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Phil,\u201d Dan breaks. It slips like a whisper out of his mouth.</p><p>Phil laughs again, low and inhibited. That fucking laugh. Dan loves it. He loves it during sex especially.</p><p>\u201cIt feels\u2026,\u201d Dan moans. \u201cFeels like a pressure. Really hard down there. I think my cock is getting stiff like yours. Can you take a look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, and pulls Dan\u2019s soft bottoms down and off swiftly.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cock stands up, pink and hard. Phil lies next to Dan and just <i>looks</i> at it. Doesn\u2019t touch. Dan blinks up at Phil\u2019s face, then down at his own throbbing erection.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Phil says. \u201cTell me how it feels.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand around it. Doesn\u2019t squeeze, just holds it.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hips push into Phil\u2019s hold. Fuck. This is so weird and good at the same time.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says. \u201cIt feels.. Oh, Phil. It feels good. It feels like you should do it more. <i>Harder</i>.\u201d</p><p>The last word is more of a command, more of Dan\u2019s normal voice. He needs Phil to just\u2026 stop fucking around and get to it. Phil is having way too much fun.</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>His hand slides easily up to the tip. He thumbs the slit of Dan\u2019s foreskin.</p><p>Dan moans low at that, hips going wild for a second to chase the feeling.</p><p>\u201cEasy does it,\u201d Phil says, and stills Dan\u2019s hips with a strong hand.</p><p>He comes back to Dan\u2019s cock once he\u2019s stopped moving. He slides it up and down, too light, too soft. Dan shivers against the touch. He can\u2019t help but bury his face in Phil\u2019s neck. So warm there, so close. He needs to get closer. Phil keeps up the light, slow pace. Dan rolls into Phil\u2019s side, fucks into Phil\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cFeels really good,\u201d Dan sighs.</p><p>His hips go steady with the pace. Slow, slow. He lets his hand wander down to grasp Phil\u2019s stiff cock in his hand. He matches Phil\u2019s pace.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Phil sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s my good boy.\u201d</p><p>Dan breathes hard against Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he asks as he gently thumbs at the head. \u201cA-am I doing it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo right,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan pretends to search, unsure. Presses at the head. Drags his hand slowly down Phil\u2019s length. Phil\u2019s hips begin to move in a similar pace to Dan\u2019s. They eventually just end up pushing into each other\u2019s fists. Lazy, slow. Dan looks up from the comfort of Phil\u2019s neck and kisses his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d Phil says once they part. \u201cSo pretty for me.\u201d</p><p>It resonates in Dan, makes him go faster into Phil\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, sweetie?\u201d he asks, stealing another chaste kiss. \u201cLike it when I call you that?\u201d</p><p>Dan moans.</p><p>\u201cNhyes,\u201d he whines. \u201cPlease. Say it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d look real pretty with my cock in your mouth,\u201d Phil says, voice low.</p><p>Dan pretends to be taken aback.</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d he asks, looking down at Phil\u2019s cock, still moving into Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>He removes the hand and presses a finger to his bottom lip. He sucks at it, tastes some of Phil.</p><p>\u201cOhh yes,\u201d Phil says. \u201cThat mouth is so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou taste good.\u201d</p><p>Phil groans, taken out of it a bit again. Stepping closer to that edge of shame. Dan just wants to savour that look on his face that doubts what they\u2019re doing. Whether it\u2019s hot and kinky or just weird. Phil removes his hand from around Dan\u2019s cock and pets Dan\u2019s cheek before he fingers through Dan\u2019s hair and starts to push him down forcefully.</p><p>Dan goes with it, stops when his face is level with Phil\u2019s dick. He takes a measuring look. Up and down, hesitant. He looks up at Phil for guidance.</p><p>\u201cJust,\u201d Phil takes his cock in hand and guides it to Dan\u2019s mouth. \u201cSuck. Right there on the tip.\u201d</p><p>Dan keeps his eyes big, expression confused and wondrous as he looks at Phil\u2019s cock. It\u2019s leaking and hard. Then he closes his mouth softly around the head. Wet suction noises fill the room before he pulls off with a loud pop.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>Phil is positively vibrating with want. He slides his cock over Dan\u2019s now closed lips.</p><p>\u201cJuuust like that,\u201d Phil encourages. \u201cTake it in your mouth, babe.\u201d</p><p>Dan resumes, sucking hesitantly. Never moving his head, just sucking right at that same spot. He pulls off, licks a little with a teasing smile. He sinks back down. Sucking hard, alternating by lolling his tongue over the tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Phil groans. \u201cTake it deeper.\u201d</p><p>Dan pretends not to understand. He keeps at what he\u2019s been doing, just to see Phil\u2019s increasing frustration make him weak with arousal. He puts his hand on Dan\u2019s head while he sucks and pushes him down slowly. Dan whines against it. The feeling of Phil\u2019s hand, strong and domineering in his hair, just taking everything. He sucks obediently. Phil pulls Dan up and down his cock by the hair.</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d Phil says. \u201cCan you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>He lets go of Dan\u2019s hair and watches. Dan really wants to take Phil deep, let him hit the back of his throat. He wants to make Phil come so bad. But he pulls off again, resumes his suckling on the tip, alternating by licks. He knows it\u2019s not nearly enough. He knows it\u2019s agony, to be teetering on the edge of something and for it not to follow through. To not get that pressure. He waits until Phil is a whimpering, thrusting mess.</p><p>Dan pulls off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks. \u201cAm I doing it wrong?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, not as an answer, but simply as a sign of disbelief and exasperation. He grabs Dan by the hair again.</p><p>\u201cJust fucking take it,\u201d he grunts and feeds his cock deep into Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p>In one swift movement, Phil\u2019s cock hits the back of Dan\u2019s throat. Dan gags loudly, eyes tearing up, but lets himself adjust to the sudden intrusion. It\u2019s different when Phil is the one commanding a deep throat. When Dan does it himself he has no problems. It\u2019s like he\u2019s made for it, not a hint of a gag reflex as he swallows Phil down deep and stays there, steadily breathing through his nose while Phil falls apart beneath him. No, this is different, and the sudden sound of a gag makes Phil\u2019s body shake with pleasure as he stares down at Dan.</p><p>Dan breaks the eye contact, cock still lodged down his throat, and whines pathetically around it. Phil pulls Dan\u2019s hair so that his mouth slides up and off his cock completely. Dan breathes shallowly through his mouth. A string of spit still connects Dan\u2019s bottom lip to the tip of Phil\u2019s cock.</p><p>Without saying anything, Phil pulls Dan\u2019s mouth onto his cock again and thrusts just as deeply into it. Dan doesn\u2019t gag this time, but there\u2019s still that unholy wet sound like a <i>click</i> as the head of Phil\u2019s cock settles deep there. Dan is practically shaking with satisfaction. Phil is so fucking hard and unforgiving by the way he just takes. He\u2019s using Dan like a toy. That doesn\u2019t happen frequently but in certain moments, like this one, it\u2019s perfect for both of them.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Phil instructs.</p><p>His voice is strained. Dan looks up at Phil curiously, eyes still a bit wet from before. He blinks. Phil gasps as soon as their eyes lock. Another squelching sound from the back of Dan\u2019s throat as Phil\u2019s hips pull back a bit and push back in. Just an involuntary movement caused by the horny twitch of his hips. Phil moans, breath quickening a bit, as if he doesn\u2019t trust himself to be able to hold back anymore.</p><p>But he does. He pulls his cock out fully one more time and allows Dan to cough and clear his throat. Dan\u2019s overdoing it for the sake of teasing Phil. He\u2019s mastered the art of sucking dick since the time that that was the only thing they allowed themselves to do back in the day. The pretend coughs still work, though. Dan feels Phil\u2019s wet cock slide against the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Phil murmurs affectionately. \u201cThat\u2019s how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so big,\u201d he says and fakes an impossibly innocent expression on his face.</p><p>He moves his head softly to mouth at the shaft. Phil shudders yet again.</p><p>\u201cYou like that down your throat, huh?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>Dan nods wordlessly, eyes closing as he loses himself into the soft kisses he places on Phil\u2019s length. It\u2019s a stark contrast. Phil\u2019s cock is hard to the point that he could come immediately from the simple fast stroke of Dan\u2019s hand. Yet Dan keeps mouthing the side softly, like he has all the time in the world to leisurely explore every inch of it.</p><p>\u201cMmh feels nice,\u201d Phil says, voice hoarse. \u201cLook so nice too.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks back up at that, eyes crinkling with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo cute when you take my cock,\u201d Phil continues.</p><p>His hands tighten in Dan\u2019s hair again. Pulls him away from his cock, but not far. He guides him to the tip, still not touching, and holds still.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cock is trapped between his stomach and the mattress underneath. He\u2019s about to bust at just that one adjective, the one that\u2019s so strangely erotic within the context of sex.</p><p><i>Cute.</i></p><p>Dan breathes hard down onto Phil\u2019s cock and swallows, expecting his mouth to be filled at any second. Phil stalls long enough for Dan to look up eventually.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says throatily as their eyes meet. \u201cCan I just fuck your throat and go buckwild?\u201d</p><p>Dan breathes in a ragged breath, eyes closing in an attempt to dull the pure need rippling through his body at the question. He has to laugh though. A short giggle, and his lips accidentally pillow on top of Phil\u2019s leaking slit.</p><p>\u201c<i>Buckwild</i>,\u201d he imitates through a grin and pulls back a bit. \u201cWhat is this, a rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeehaw,\u201d Phil says weakly.</p><p>They lose it at that. Phil\u2019s hand disappears from Dan\u2019s hair and Dan\u2019s face slumps down to muffle his giggles against the soft skin in the crease between Phil\u2019s ball sack and leg. He looks up at Phil whose hands are fully covering his mouth, eyes glistening with laughter.</p><p>Phil shakes his head, hands coming undone from his mouth. One returns downward to pet the side of Dan\u2019s head and the other lies flat against the bed. Phil slumps his head down on the mattress and stares up at the ceiling as he breathes laboured breaths to stop from laughing. Dan\u2019s body is still shaking with it, but it slows as he pushes into Phil\u2019s gentle hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d Phil ponders aloud, another giggle escaping his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d Dan murmurs, regaining some sense of reality.</p><p>The reality is that Phil\u2019s erection is still as urgent and it\u2019s poking at Dan\u2019s cheek and that is so hot he forgets to laugh anymore.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil replies, pushing himself up onto his elbow in order to look at Dan. \u201cI hate how hot it is.\u201d</p><p>Dan mouths at Phil\u2019s shaft again. Slowly, leisurely.</p><p>\u201cDo I look cute?\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Phil moans.</p><p>The gentle hand comes powerful into Dan\u2019s hair again, guiding his lips to slide up and down the side of his cock. Dan breathes hard.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan sighs. \u201cYes, fuck my mouth.\u201d</p><p>He breathes another sigh as his mouth slides with more urgency just by the demanding force of Phil\u2019s hand in his hair.</p><p>\u201cGo <i>buckwild</i>,\u201d Dan says, shooting a pointed look up at Phil.</p><p>Phil stretches his lips and bites the inside of his mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck your throat so hard that I come any second and that is not a laughing matter,\u201d he says, mouth stretching wider as he struggles harder to keep his word.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan moans exaggeratedly. \u201cNeed to taste that cum.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s expression turns serious at that. He pulls Dan into the same position as before. Mouth just above his cock, begging to be stuffed full. Dan clears his throat and swallows, readying himself for what\u2019s to come. They lock eyes for a moment before Phil finally pulls Dan\u2019s head down and thrusts his hips up, creating a perfect, fast slide deep into Dan\u2019s tight throat.</p><p>He keeps Dan\u2019s head down for a few seconds as he fucks into that sweet spot right at the back of Dan\u2019s throat. Dan moans, voice almost lost, but the sound mixed with the wet squelch created by Phil repeatedly fucking into him creates an even rawer noise that makes Dan\u2019s cock twitch and leak where it\u2019s trapped and neglected against the mattress. Phil pulls Dan\u2019s head back, not completely off this time, and repeats the process. Each time it goes faster. Dan\u2019s nose right in the trail of hair at the small pudge of Phil\u2019s stomach. Phil sounds a string of desperate breaths, completely taken by sensation.</p><p>\u201cGonna fucking come,\u201d he strains to say, \u201cso fucking hard down your pretty little throat, gonna fill it up \u2018til it spills right over with all that nasty cum.\u201d</p><p>Dan is really about to come untouched at those words. He inhales hard. Lets Phil keep going, going, going until he reaches that wonderful edge and floods Dan\u2019s mouth with the promised cum. Phil pulls back at that, and fucks shallowly into Dan\u2019s mouth as he spills and spills, a hard breath exhaled through his mouth. When his tense muscles eventually relax he moves Dan\u2019s mouth off his now oversensitive cock.</p><p>Dan breathes hard through his nose. Phil\u2019s hand pets him sweetly again, tilts Dan\u2019s chin up a bit to get a proper look.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan opens his mouth, shows off the pearly white cum that pools on his wet little tongue. Some of it spills down his chin. Dan closes his mouth and swallows, eyes soft up at Phil\u2019s. Phil traces the tiny wad of cum that slipped out, pushes it against Dan\u2019s skin as he guides it back into his mouth. Dan sucks gently at it and swallows.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good mouthful, babe,\u201d Phil sighs.</p><p>Dan is practically vibrating with the need to come. He pulls himself up on top of Phil fast and crashes his used mouth onto Phil\u2019s lips. Phil wraps his arm around Dan and moans.</p><p>\u201cNeedy little boy,\u201d Phil says. \u201cDo you maybe need to come?\u201d</p><p>Dan collects himself a bit. The feeling of finally being able to slide his cock over Phil\u2019s stomach and getting some relief is going to make him crazy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he responds. \u201cA little bit.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggles a laugh, but before long his hand pushes down between their bodies and wraps around Dan\u2019s dick. He squeezes tightly, just like Dan loves, and moves it slowly up and down. Dan whines, head falling onto Phil\u2019s neck as he desperately chases relief.</p><p>\u201cSo good for me,\u201d Phil murmurs against Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cGonna make you come all cute and warm on me.\u201d</p><p>Dan trembles. He fucks harder into Phil\u2019s fist in time with his movements. The slide becomes looser, faster up and down Dan now that he\u2019s close. Fast rhythmic thrusts pause into a stutter, a moment of stillness, as Dan\u2019s body tightens up completely and he finds himself biting down on Phil\u2019s neck. Then bliss overcomes him. Such wonderful relief, as all that tension and almost-shame that caused his arousal in the first place leaves him. Cum squirts all over Phil\u2019s stomach messily as he rides out the orgasm through high pitched moans and pathetic pumps of his hips.</p><p>Dan slumps on Phil\u2019s side, head coming to rest on his arm. He breathes hard for a bit. His dick is softening but still sensitive. Phil\u2019s hand is still there though, like a reassurance, almost an apology for not having touched it more during this. Dan smiles to himself at the thought.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re awful,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>He turns to lie on his side and face Dan. They look into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely filthy,\u201d Dan agrees. \u201cWhat would Kathryn say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Phil warns, staring.</p><p>It isn\u2019t unlike Dan to bring up either the most gruesome, innocent, or completely off-limit things during what\u2019s supposed to be the lovely afterglow of an orgasm. He can\u2019t help himself. Not when he\u2019s this loose and giddy and the words cause such a blunt reaction from Phil. He giggles, gives Phil a quick peck on the lips.</p><p>His hand comes down to touch Phil\u2019s cock again. It\u2019s softened completely. Dan looks into Phil\u2019s eyes with a devilish smirk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of your mum,\u201d he says quickly before he crashes his mouth on Phil\u2019s and licks into it, wet tongues clashing together in a completely impure kiss.</p><p>Phil pulls away laughing. He shakes his head and ruffles Dan\u2019s hair playfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you a hundred times to not start with that again,\u201d he complains.</p><p>Dan laughs heartily. He can\u2019t stop. Phil\u2019s reaction is too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he wheezes through laughter. \u201cYour face is just priceless.\u201d</p><p>Phil sighs, relaxing as he simply watches Dan laugh through fond eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fucking believe you said,\u201d the laughter rolls out of Dan, \u201cyeehaw during sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck that off the bucket list,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>They lie close like that for a while, making stupid jokes and laughing together. At themselves, at their weirdness, and at how sexy all of it somehow is.</p></p>",

It\u2019s going fast. Faster than his brain can register. He only catches brief words. Capitalized sentences that he\u2019s learned from experience to not say out loud. It can be difficult not to, especially as he scans his brain for something interesting to say. He has been live for forty five minutes by now. He could easily announce tonight\u2019s top fans and take a couple last questions and call it a night. His eyes flit over his own face, where it\u2019s pixelated on the computer. He reminds himself to smile.</p><p>\u201cAlright, guys, well\u2026,\u201d Dan says to round up, but then he stalls at a question that catches his eye.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan where\u2019s Phil? Is he asleep?</i>\u201d he reads out loud as he clicks \u2018accept\u2019.</p><p>He chuckles, resting his chin on top of his fist.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re under the impression that Phil has any more semblance of a sleep schedule than me you would be very wrong,\u201d he says, then catches himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He could be sleeping, actually. I\u2019m not the only one that stays up until four am, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>Phil only stays up until four am if Dan\u2019s having a bad night and needs a distraction, he thinks but doesn\u2019t say. In recent years, Phil\u2019s personal limit had been two in the morning. Dan laughs to himself.</p><p>\u201cActually, the other night I\u2026 did something in my sleep,\u201d he continues, only realising he\u2019s saying it once he\u2019s started and stops himself in time to not go into details.</p><p>Wow. Is he doing this? The memory flashes back. Waking up from the feeling of Phil\u2019s long fingers scratching through his hair absentmindedly. Feeling completely satisfied and boneless, but not understanding why. Phil holding back his laughter as Dan slowly realised that he had started humping in his sleep like when he was teenager. This had been different from those lonely times. He hadn\u2019t woken up sweaty and ashamed on top of sticky sheets. This time he had another person there who had eagerly helped out with the problem.</p><p>\u201cOh come on,\u201d Dan berates as he sees a number of sexual comments. \u201cI sleepwalked. I don\u2019t remember it, honestly. Phil was in the lounge and I had walked to the kitchen or something.\u201d</p><p>More sexual comments. Dan laughs. It\u2019s the only way he\u2019s found to cover up his blushing. The web camera doesn\u2019t catch up on it really, but it feels like they can tell either way. The small laughs keep him from saying too much, makes it easier to lie.</p><p>\u201cAnyway I walked in there, and then I was just stood there like an idiot,\u201d Dan says. \u201cLike something out of a horror film. Phil had this momentary freak out because he thought if he woke me up I\u2019d go crazy.\u201d</p><p>Dan already regrets bringing it up. Phil will have to address it in his next live show. It could easily become a <i>thing</i> that people hold on to like so many other things had become during the years. So many unexpected topics and moments, constantly tweeted at them and talked about and for that sake become a permanent part of the Dan And Phil narrative.</p><p>Phil is better at biting his tongue. He doesn\u2019t talk on autopilot the same way Dan does. Dan just can\u2019t stop his train of thoughts. He makes decisions quickly, impulsively. He\u2019s better than he used to be, especially after him and Phil established some rules, but Dan\u2019s already overthinking and it\u2019s making him feel stupid.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I ended up going back to my room before he accidentally woke me up.\u201d Dan chuckles. \u201cPhil, the buffoon, would probably have managed to drop something and woke me up if I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The chat becomes impossibly faster. Slow chat mode is no match against 12,000 viewers that are always excited to hear about Phil. There goes the early exit. Dan enjoys it, though. He may not be able to say exactly what had happened, but it feels good to tell the audience about Phil\u2019s weird thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHe literally said the next day,\u201d Dan says, \u201cthat he\u2019d been scared to wake me because sleepwalkers go crazy when they\u2019re woken up in horror films. Is that a thing? Like, what actually happens when someone who sleepwalks wakes up? Is it bad?\u201d</p><p>He sees messages roll in.</p><p>\u201c<i>I used to sleepwalk and it was honestly terrifying</i>\u201d,</p><p>\u201c<i>My mum thought i was possessed by the amount of times she woke up seeing me stand at her bedside.</i>\u201d</p><p>Dan reads out the second message.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s some supernatural shit. That\u2019s what Phil used to do as a child too. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve put myself at risk living with him.\u201d</p><p>Dan reads more messages, different theories and personal anecdotes coming in droves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna google it,\u201d Dan says eventually.</p><p>He types it in the google search and hits enter.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here we go.\u201d</p><p>He furrows his brow as he reads. The first result makes no sense.</p><p>\u201c<i>It is a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because it may cause them a heart attack, shock, brain damage, or something else. It is not a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because of the possible injury the sleepwalker may inflict upon themselves or the person waking them up</i>,\u201d he reads quickly.</p><p>He makes a face as he processes the information.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he splutters. \u201cIs it a myth or not? Make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the source.</p><p>\u201c<i>The Register</i>. Yeah. Get your facts straight. I read the first google result and I expect to be fully informed by the first hit, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>He grins at his own joke. He accepts one of the premium messages.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan, they mean that while it may not cause any physical or emotional reaction it could be unsafe as the sleepwalker might be in a compromising position. Fall down or be holding something they could accidentally injure themselves with. I know because I once woke my sister up from sleepwalking and she almost fell down a flight of stairs.</i>\u201d</p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully as he reads it out.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cI totally interpreted that wrong, then. That does sound quite harrowing. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t wake me up.\u201d</p><p>Dan has to let out a small laugh. Lying in bed is not technically sleepwalking, and if Phil had woken him up there would have been no risk of Dan accidentally injuring himself. It was a stupid topic to bring up, but it actually is starting to interest him.</p><p>He spends another few minutes looking up results and reading some of the viewers\u2019 experiences. He ignores the messages that are worried about his health, advising him to go to bed on time and other solutions he\u2019s heard a million times before that would effectively improve his quality of sleep. He\u2019s not exactly bothered by it, he just doesn\u2019t think it applies to his situation. It had only been a wet dream after all.</p><p>He caves by reading someone\u2019s message that says they hope he\u2019s okay and trying his best to sleep better.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Dan says. \u201cThat was a week ago and it hasn\u2019t happened since. No more possessed-Dan scenarios for Phil.\u201d</p><p>He drops the topic and goes on to read out the top fans. He doesn\u2019t take any last messages or question, he just thanks the viewers for watching. He tells them to drink some water, get out in the sun, and to remember to take a few moments to breathe. He smiles, says goodbye, and clicks the \u201con air\u201d button. Afterwards he quietly checks to see if he\u2019s really off air. He puts the piece of tape back over his webcam and turns off the mic function on his computer. Might be a bit much, but the idea of accidentally staying live scares him enough to repeat that process after every liveshow.</p><p>He types a tweet thanking people for tuning in and posts it. He reads some of the replies that roll in. Someone\u2019s already quoted the whole sleepwalking scenario. He closes the laptop and sits in silence. Not long after he feels two hands come to squeeze his shoulders.</p><p>He leans his head back until it bumps Phil\u2019s stomach. Keeps it there while Phil massages him gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing you in the kitchen,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan sighs.</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hands work his shoulders steadily. Then his fingers come to softly slide up and down Dan\u2019s neck. He shudders visibly. His head immediately shifts. Something about the touch is always too much, always right between arousal and oversensitivity. But the fingers go further, pet into Dan\u2019s hair. Phil pulls his head back so that Dan looks at him.</p><p>Phil is in his pyjamas, hair pushed back, glasses on. He leans down and kisses Dan\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cBeen thinking about that night, have you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Dan smiles. He remembers that boneless feeling. How urgent Phil\u2019s erection had been in his hand. How it felt, stiff in his mouth. Something about tired sex was such a relief. The body hasn\u2019t tensed with the stress of a work day yet. The mind hasn\u2019t fully registered the environment. It hasn\u2019t recollected the thoughts that worried it the night before. It\u2019s easier to listen to your body, to go with it. To let yourself be handled by the man in your bed.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Dan says. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Phil goes to sit on the bed. He pats his hand next to him and Dan immediately gets up for the silent invitation. He sits next to Phil and lets himself be touched. Over the shirt, squeezing one of Dan\u2019s pecks. They kiss.</p><p>\u201cI take it you have,\u201d Dan teases.</p><p>\u201cThe way you just fucked into me,\u201d Phil recollects. \u201cSenselessly, all taken with it. It amused me at first, but then it was this weird combination of cute and hot at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute?\u201d Dan questions. \u201cYou want me to be cute in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>His hand is still rubbing over Dan\u2019s chest. Completely just feeling him up, taking. Dan\u2019s used to it. Phil can\u2019t keep his hands to himself and he hasn\u2019t since they first met. It\u2019s still effective. Dan is half hard and leaning into the touches.</p><p>\u201cIt was innocent,\u201d Phil elaborates. \u201cInnocent but at the same time, not at all. You were so needy for it even though you didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dan says, smirk creeping onto his face. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you I\u2019ll do that in bed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil shrugs. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Anything you do is cute. And hot.\u201d</p><p>Dan has learned to accept that \u2018cute\u2019 is a good thing in reference to himself. He despised that word for a long time. How his mum would patronizingly call him that well into his upper teens, while he was struggling with his identity and his masculinity. It wasn\u2019t until Phil started to say it that it felt good. Made him feel\u2026 precious, in a way.</p><p>\u201cAm I cute when I suck your dick?\u201d Dan teases.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Phil sounds as he kisses Dan deeper. \u201cSuper cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Dan\u2019s breath goes hot. \u201cMe with your tip in my mouth, have to ask for help? Until you get frustrated and fuck my mouth deep and come down my cute little throat?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, breathing hard. He chuckles a little bit.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that so hot coming out of your mouth?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan grins. He puts his hand on Phil\u2019s crotch over his pyjama bottoms. \u201cOh, you\u2019re hard there. Why are you? What happens if I..?\u201d</p><p>Dan squeezes softly. Phil\u2019s hips automatically thrust into the touch.</p><p>\u201cUngh,\u201d he moans, as if in pain, against Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dan asks, playing hard into a sweet, gullible voice. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Dan,\u201d Phil says, putting his hand on top of Dan\u2019s between his legs. He pushes Dan\u2019s hand down harder. \u201cYou little tease. It feels amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dan says. \u201cThen what happens if I..?\u201d</p><p>He slips his hand under Phil\u2019s bottoms and softly touches his cock. He\u2019s not wearing any pants underneath. A drop of precum rolls down his shaft. Dan smooths his thumb over it, then pretends to be shocked.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d Dan says. \u201cAre you peeing?\u201d</p><p>He still keeps his hand steady there. Phil groans, pushes on top of Dan until he\u2019s lying down on top of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNo, babe,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means you\u2019re doing well. Feels so good.\u201d</p><p>Phil stutters as he says it. He seems so deliciously apprehensive, exploring this type of dirty talk. Like he\u2019s ashamed of liking it. Dan loves those kind of kinks the most. How he has to almost convince Phil that it\u2019s okay, that it\u2019s play.</p><p>\u201cOh it does?\u201d Dan says, filling his voice with wonder. He squeezes a bit more. \u201cThat feels good?\u201d</p><p>Phil makes another almost pained noise. He pulls Dan\u2019s hand off of his cock, out his bottoms. He throws his T-shirt off and pins Dan\u2019s wrists down on top of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Dan asks, eyes big.</p><p>\u201cThought you needed a lesson on teasing,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>The pressure of Phil on top of him is somethin Dan will never get used to. How the heavy body keeps him still. How those big hands tighten around his wrists. Dan keens at the sensation, can\u2019t keep up the pretense of not understanding when his cock is so hard. Phil fumbles out his bottoms and pulls Dan\u2019s T-shirt off over his head, then immediately returns to their original position.</p><p>\u201cMakes me wanna fuck you so bad,\u201d Phil breathes onto Dan\u2019s neck before he nips at the skin, pushing their cocks together.</p><p>Only the thin layer off cotton provided by Dan\u2019s joggers keep them from fully touching. Dan moans, voice pitching higher than normal.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says as his eyes shut. So many sensations. \u201cI feel weird down there. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel weird, do you?\u201d Phil asks, gruff voice against Dan\u2019s neck. \u201cHow could that be? Describe it to me\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Apparently Dan\u2019s not the only one that can tease. Phil pulls his hips back, refusing to grind them down. Dan looks up at him desperately. He needs that push.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Phil grins, studying Dan\u2019s frustrated expression. \u201cIf you feel weird we might have take you to hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Phil,\u201d Dan breaks. It slips like a whisper out of his mouth.</p><p>Phil laughs again, low and inhibited. That fucking laugh. Dan loves it. He loves it during sex especially.</p><p>\u201cIt feels\u2026,\u201d Dan moans. \u201cFeels like a pressure. Really hard down there. I think my cock is getting stiff like yours. Can you take a look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, and pulls Dan\u2019s soft bottoms down and off swiftly.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cock stands up, pink and hard. Phil lies next to Dan and just <i>looks</i> at it. Doesn\u2019t touch. Dan blinks up at Phil\u2019s face, then down at his own throbbing erection.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Phil says. \u201cTell me how it feels.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand around it. Doesn\u2019t squeeze, just holds it.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hips push into Phil\u2019s hold. Fuck. This is so weird and good at the same time.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says. \u201cIt feels.. Oh, Phil. It feels good. It feels like you should do it more. <i>Harder</i>.\u201d</p><p>The last word is more of a command, more of Dan\u2019s normal voice. He needs Phil to just\u2026 stop fucking around and get to it. Phil is having way too much fun.</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>His hand slides easily up to the tip. He thumbs the slit of Dan\u2019s foreskin.</p><p>Dan moans low at that, hips going wild for a second to chase the feeling.</p><p>\u201cEasy does it,\u201d Phil says, and stills Dan\u2019s hips with a strong hand.</p><p>He comes back to Dan\u2019s cock once he\u2019s stopped moving. He slides it up and down, too light, too soft. Dan shivers against the touch. He can\u2019t help but bury his face in Phil\u2019s neck. So warm there, so close. He needs to get closer. Phil keeps up the light, slow pace. Dan rolls into Phil\u2019s side, fucks into Phil\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cFeels really good,\u201d Dan sighs.</p><p>His hips go steady with the pace. Slow, slow. He lets his hand wander down to grasp Phil\u2019s stiff cock in his hand. He matches Phil\u2019s pace.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Phil sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s my good boy.\u201d</p><p>Dan breathes hard against Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he asks as he gently thumbs at the head. \u201cA-am I doing it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo right,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan pretends to search, unsure. Presses at the head. Drags his hand slowly down Phil\u2019s length. Phil\u2019s hips begin to move in a similar pace to Dan\u2019s. They eventually just end up pushing into each other\u2019s fists. Lazy, slow. Dan looks up from the comfort of Phil\u2019s neck and kisses his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d Phil says once they part. \u201cSo pretty for me.\u201d</p><p>It resonates in Dan, makes him go faster into Phil\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, sweetie?\u201d he asks, stealing another chaste kiss. \u201cLike it when I call you that?\u201d</p><p>Dan moans.</p><p>\u201cNhyes,\u201d he whines. \u201cPlease. Say it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d look real pretty with my cock in your mouth,\u201d Phil says, voice low.</p><p>Dan pretends to be taken aback.</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d he asks, looking down at Phil\u2019s cock, still moving into Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>He removes the hand and presses a finger to his bottom lip. He sucks at it, tastes some of Phil.</p><p>\u201cOhh yes,\u201d Phil says. \u201cThat mouth is so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou taste good.\u201d</p><p>Phil groans, taken out of it a bit again. Stepping closer to that edge of shame. Dan just wants to savour that look on his face that doubts what they\u2019re doing. Whether it\u2019s hot and kinky or just weird. Phil removes his hand from around Dan\u2019s cock and pets Dan\u2019s cheek before he fingers through Dan\u2019s hair and starts to push him down forcefully.</p><p>Dan goes with it, stops when his face is level with Phil\u2019s dick. He takes a measuring look. Up and down, hesitant. He looks up at Phil for guidance.</p><p>\u201cJust,\u201d Phil takes his cock in hand and guides it to Dan\u2019s mouth. \u201cSuck. Right there on the tip.\u201d</p><p>Dan keeps his eyes big, expression confused and wondrous as he looks at Phil\u2019s cock. It\u2019s leaking and hard. Then he closes his mouth softly around the head. Wet suction noises fill the room before he pulls off with a loud pop.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>Phil is positively vibrating with want. He slides his cock over Dan\u2019s now closed lips.</p><p>\u201cJuuust like that,\u201d Phil encourages. \u201cTake it in your mouth, babe.\u201d</p><p>Dan resumes, sucking hesitantly. Never moving his head, just sucking right at that same spot. He pulls off, licks a little with a teasing smile. He sinks back down. Sucking hard, alternating by lolling his tongue over the tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Phil groans. \u201cTake it deeper.\u201d</p><p>Dan pretends not to understand. He keeps at what he\u2019s been doing, just to see Phil\u2019s increasing frustration make him weak with arousal. He puts his hand on Dan\u2019s head while he sucks and pushes him down slowly. Dan whines against it. The feeling of Phil\u2019s hand, strong and domineering in his hair, just taking everything. He sucks obediently. Phil pulls Dan up and down his cock by the hair.</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d Phil says. \u201cCan you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>He lets go of Dan\u2019s hair and watches. Dan really wants to take Phil deep, let him hit the back of his throat. He wants to make Phil come so bad. But he pulls off again, resumes his suckling on the tip, alternating by licks. He knows it\u2019s not nearly enough. He knows it\u2019s agony, to be teetering on the edge of something and for it not to follow through. To not get that pressure. He waits until Phil is a whimpering, thrusting mess.</p><p>Dan pulls off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks. \u201cAm I doing it wrong?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head, not as an answer, but simply as a sign of disbelief and exasperation. He grabs Dan by the hair again.</p><p>\u201cJust fucking take it,\u201d he grunts and feeds his cock deep into Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p>In one swift movement, Phil\u2019s cock hits the back of Dan\u2019s throat. Dan gags loudly, eyes tearing up, but lets himself adjust to the sudden intrusion. It\u2019s different when Phil is the one commanding a deep throat. When Dan does it himself he has no problems. It\u2019s like he\u2019s made for it, not a hint of a gag reflex as he swallows Phil down deep and stays there, steadily breathing through his nose while Phil falls apart beneath him. No, this is different, and the sudden sound of a gag makes Phil\u2019s body shake with pleasure as he stares down at Dan.</p><p>Dan breaks the eye contact, cock still lodged down his throat, and whines pathetically around it. Phil pulls Dan\u2019s hair so that his mouth slides up and off his cock completely. Dan breathes shallowly through his mouth. A string of spit still connects Dan\u2019s bottom lip to the tip of Phil\u2019s cock.</p><p>Without saying anything, Phil pulls Dan\u2019s mouth onto his cock again and thrusts just as deeply into it. Dan doesn\u2019t gag this time, but there\u2019s still that unholy wet sound like a <i>click</i> as the head of Phil\u2019s cock settles deep there. Dan is practically shaking with satisfaction. Phil is so fucking hard and unforgiving by the way he just takes. He\u2019s using Dan like a toy. That doesn\u2019t happen frequently but in certain moments, like this one, it\u2019s perfect for both of them.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Phil instructs.</p><p>His voice is strained. Dan looks up at Phil curiously, eyes still a bit wet from before. He blinks. Phil gasps as soon as their eyes lock. Another squelching sound from the back of Dan\u2019s throat as Phil\u2019s hips pull back a bit and push back in. Just an involuntary movement caused by the horny twitch of his hips. Phil moans, breath quickening a bit, as if he doesn\u2019t trust himself to be able to hold back anymore.</p><p>But he does. He pulls his cock out fully one more time and allows Dan to cough and clear his throat. Dan\u2019s overdoing it for the sake of teasing Phil. He\u2019s mastered the art of sucking dick since the time that that was the only thing they allowed themselves to do back in the day. The pretend coughs still work, though. Dan feels Phil\u2019s wet cock slide against the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Phil murmurs affectionately. \u201cThat\u2019s how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so big,\u201d he says and fakes an impossibly innocent expression on his face.</p><p>He moves his head softly to mouth at the shaft. Phil shudders yet again.</p><p>\u201cYou like that down your throat, huh?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>Dan nods wordlessly, eyes closing as he loses himself into the soft kisses he places on Phil\u2019s length. It\u2019s a stark contrast. Phil\u2019s cock is hard to the point that he could come immediately from the simple fast stroke of Dan\u2019s hand. Yet Dan keeps mouthing the side softly, like he has all the time in the world to leisurely explore every inch of it.</p><p>\u201cMmh feels nice,\u201d Phil says, voice hoarse. \u201cLook so nice too.\u201d</p><p>Dan looks back up at that, eyes crinkling with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo cute when you take my cock,\u201d Phil continues.</p><p>His hands tighten in Dan\u2019s hair again. Pulls him away from his cock, but not far. He guides him to the tip, still not touching, and holds still.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cock is trapped between his stomach and the mattress underneath. He\u2019s about to bust at just that one adjective, the one that\u2019s so strangely erotic within the context of sex.</p><p><i>Cute.</i></p><p>Dan breathes hard down onto Phil\u2019s cock and swallows, expecting his mouth to be filled at any second. Phil stalls long enough for Dan to look up eventually.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says throatily as their eyes meet. \u201cCan I just fuck your throat and go buckwild?\u201d</p><p>Dan breathes in a ragged breath, eyes closing in an attempt to dull the pure need rippling through his body at the question. He has to laugh though. A short giggle, and his lips accidentally pillow on top of Phil\u2019s leaking slit.</p><p>\u201c<i>Buckwild</i>,\u201d he imitates through a grin and pulls back a bit. \u201cWhat is this, a rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeehaw,\u201d Phil says weakly.</p><p>They lose it at that. Phil\u2019s hand disappears from Dan\u2019s hair and Dan\u2019s face slumps down to muffle his giggles against the soft skin in the crease between Phil\u2019s ball sack and leg. He looks up at Phil whose hands are fully covering his mouth, eyes glistening with laughter.</p><p>Phil shakes his head, hands coming undone from his mouth. One returns downward to pet the side of Dan\u2019s head and the other lies flat against the bed. Phil slumps his head down on the mattress and stares up at the ceiling as he breathes laboured breaths to stop from laughing. Dan\u2019s body is still shaking with it, but it slows as he pushes into Phil\u2019s gentle hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d Phil ponders aloud, another giggle escaping his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d Dan murmurs, regaining some sense of reality.</p><p>The reality is that Phil\u2019s erection is still as urgent and it\u2019s poking at Dan\u2019s cheek and that is so hot he forgets to laugh anymore.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil replies, pushing himself up onto his elbow in order to look at Dan. \u201cI hate how hot it is.\u201d</p><p>Dan mouths at Phil\u2019s shaft again. Slowly, leisurely.</p><p>\u201cDo I look cute?\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Phil moans.</p><p>The gentle hand comes powerful into Dan\u2019s hair again, guiding his lips to slide up and down the side of his cock. Dan breathes hard.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan sighs. \u201cYes, fuck my mouth.\u201d</p><p>He breathes another sigh as his mouth slides with more urgency just by the demanding force of Phil\u2019s hand in his hair.</p><p>\u201cGo <i>buckwild</i>,\u201d Dan says, shooting a pointed look up at Phil.</p><p>Phil stretches his lips and bites the inside of his mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck your throat so hard that I come any second and that is not a laughing matter,\u201d he says, mouth stretching wider as he struggles harder to keep his word.</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Dan moans exaggeratedly. \u201cNeed to taste that cum.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s expression turns serious at that. He pulls Dan into the same position as before. Mouth just above his cock, begging to be stuffed full. Dan clears his throat and swallows, readying himself for what\u2019s to come. They lock eyes for a moment before Phil finally pulls Dan\u2019s head down and thrusts his hips up, creating a perfect, fast slide deep into Dan\u2019s tight throat.</p><p>He keeps Dan\u2019s head down for a few seconds as he fucks into that sweet spot right at the back of Dan\u2019s throat. Dan moans, voice almost lost, but the sound mixed with the wet squelch created by Phil repeatedly fucking into him creates an even rawer noise that makes Dan\u2019s cock twitch and leak where it\u2019s trapped and neglected against the mattress. Phil pulls Dan\u2019s head back, not completely off this time, and repeats the process. Each time it goes faster. Dan\u2019s nose right in the trail of hair at the small pudge of Phil\u2019s stomach. Phil sounds a string of desperate breaths, completely taken by sensation.</p><p>\u201cGonna fucking come,\u201d he strains to say, \u201cso fucking hard down your pretty little throat, gonna fill it up \u2018til it spills right over with all that nasty cum.\u201d</p><p>Dan is really about to come untouched at those words. He inhales hard. Lets Phil keep going, going, going until he reaches that wonderful edge and floods Dan\u2019s mouth with the promised cum. Phil pulls back at that, and fucks shallowly into Dan\u2019s mouth as he spills and spills, a hard breath exhaled through his mouth. When his tense muscles eventually relax he moves Dan\u2019s mouth off his now oversensitive cock.</p><p>Dan breathes hard through his nose. Phil\u2019s hand pets him sweetly again, tilts Dan\u2019s chin up a bit to get a proper look.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan opens his mouth, shows off the pearly white cum that pools on his wet little tongue. Some of it spills down his chin. Dan closes his mouth and swallows, eyes soft up at Phil\u2019s. Phil traces the tiny wad of cum that slipped out, pushes it against Dan\u2019s skin as he guides it back into his mouth. Dan sucks gently at it and swallows.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good mouthful, babe,\u201d Phil sighs.</p><p>Dan is practically vibrating with the need to come. He pulls himself up on top of Phil fast and crashes his used mouth onto Phil\u2019s lips. Phil wraps his arm around Dan and moans.</p><p>\u201cNeedy little boy,\u201d Phil says. \u201cDo you maybe need to come?\u201d</p><p>Dan collects himself a bit. The feeling of finally being able to slide his cock over Phil\u2019s stomach and getting some relief is going to make him crazy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he responds. \u201cA little bit.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggles a laugh, but before long his hand pushes down between their bodies and wraps around Dan\u2019s dick. He squeezes tightly, just like Dan loves, and moves it slowly up and down. Dan whines, head falling onto Phil\u2019s neck as he desperately chases relief.</p><p>\u201cSo good for me,\u201d Phil murmurs against Dan\u2019s hair. \u201cGonna make you come all cute and warm on me.\u201d</p><p>Dan trembles. He fucks harder into Phil\u2019s fist in time with his movements. The slide becomes looser, faster up and down Dan now that he\u2019s close. Fast rhythmic thrusts pause into a stutter, a moment of stillness, as Dan\u2019s body tightens up completely and he finds himself biting down on Phil\u2019s neck. Then bliss overcomes him. Such wonderful relief, as all that tension and almost-shame that caused his arousal in the first place leaves him. Cum squirts all over Phil\u2019s stomach messily as he rides out the orgasm through high pitched moans and pathetic pumps of his hips.</p><p>Dan slumps on Phil\u2019s side, head coming to rest on his arm. He breathes hard for a bit. His dick is softening but still sensitive. Phil\u2019s hand is still there though, like a reassurance, almost an apology for not having touched it more during this. Dan smiles to himself at the thought.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re awful,\u201d Phil grins.</p><p>He turns to lie on his side and face Dan. They look into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely filthy,\u201d Dan agrees. \u201cWhat would Kathryn say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Phil warns, staring.</p><p>It isn\u2019t unlike Dan to bring up either the most gruesome, innocent, or completely off-limit things during what\u2019s supposed to be the lovely afterglow of an orgasm. He can\u2019t help himself. Not when he\u2019s this loose and giddy and the words cause such a blunt reaction from Phil. He giggles, gives Phil a quick peck on the lips.</p><p>His hand comes down to touch Phil\u2019s cock again. It\u2019s softened completely. Dan looks into Phil\u2019s eyes with a devilish smirk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of your mum,\u201d he says quickly before he crashes his mouth on Phil\u2019s and licks into it, wet tongues clashing together in a completely impure kiss.</p><p>Phil pulls away laughing. He shakes his head and ruffles Dan\u2019s hair playfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you a hundred times to not start with that again,\u201d he complains.</p><p>Dan laughs heartily. He can\u2019t stop. Phil\u2019s reaction is too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he wheezes through laughter. \u201cYour face is just priceless.\u201d</p><p>Phil sighs, relaxing as he simply watches Dan laugh through fond eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fucking believe you said,\u201d the laughter rolls out of Dan, \u201cyeehaw during sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck that off the bucket list,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>They lie close like that for a while, making stupid jokes and laughing together. At themselves, at their weirdness, and at how sexy all of it somehow is.</p></p>",

It&rsquo;s going fast. Faster than his brain can register. He only catches brief words. Capitalized sentences that he&rsquo;s learned from experience to not say out loud. It can be difficult not to, especially as he scans his brain for something interesting to say. He has been live for forty five minutes by now. He could easily announce tonight&rsquo;s top fans and take a couple last questions and call it a night. His eyes flit over his own face, where it&rsquo;s pixelated on the computer. He reminds himself to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, guys, well&hellip;,&rdquo; Dan says to round up, but then he stalls at a question that catches his eye.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Dan where&rsquo;s Phil? Is he asleep?</i>&rdquo; he reads out loud as he clicks &lsquo;accept&rsquo;.</p><p>He chuckles, resting his chin on top of his fist.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re under the impression that Phil has any more semblance of a sleep schedule than me you would be very wrong,&rdquo; he says, then catches himself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing. He could be sleeping, actually. I&rsquo;m not the only one that stays up until four am, is all I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil only stays up until four am if Dan&rsquo;s having a bad night and needs a distraction, he thinks but doesn&rsquo;t say. In recent years, Phil&rsquo;s personal limit had been two in the morning. Dan laughs to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, the other night I&hellip; did something in my sleep,&rdquo; he continues, only realising he&rsquo;s saying it once he&rsquo;s started and stops himself in time to not go into details.</p><p>Wow. Is he doing this? The memory flashes back. Waking up from the feeling of Phil&rsquo;s long fingers scratching through his hair absentmindedly. Feeling completely satisfied and boneless, but not understanding why. Phil holding back his laughter as Dan slowly realised that he had started humping in his sleep like when he was teenager. This had been different from those lonely times. He hadn&rsquo;t woken up sweaty and ashamed on top of sticky sheets. This time he had another person there who had eagerly helped out with the problem.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on,&rdquo; Dan berates as he sees a number of sexual comments. &ldquo;I sleepwalked. I don&rsquo;t remember it, honestly. Phil was in the lounge and I had walked to the kitchen or something.&rdquo;</p><p>More sexual comments. Dan laughs. It&rsquo;s the only way he&rsquo;s found to cover up his blushing. The web camera doesn&rsquo;t catch up on it really, but it feels like they can tell either way. The small laughs keep him from saying too much, makes it easier to lie.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway I walked in there, and then I was just stood there like an idiot,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Like something out of a horror film. Phil had this momentary freak out because he thought if he woke me up I&rsquo;d go crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan already regrets bringing it up. Phil will have to address it in his next live show. It could easily become a <i>thing</i> that people hold on to like so many other things had become during the years. So many unexpected topics and moments, constantly tweeted at them and talked about and for that sake become a permanent part of the Dan And Phil narrative.</p><p>Phil is better at biting his tongue. He doesn&rsquo;t talk on autopilot the same way Dan does. Dan just can&rsquo;t stop his train of thoughts. He makes decisions quickly, impulsively. He&rsquo;s better than he used to be, especially after him and Phil established some rules, but Dan&rsquo;s already overthinking and it&rsquo;s making him feel stupid.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, I ended up going back to my room before he accidentally woke me up.&rdquo; Dan chuckles. &ldquo;Phil, the buffoon, would probably have managed to drop something and woke me up if I hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>The chat becomes impossibly faster. Slow chat mode is no match against 12,000 viewers that are always excited to hear about Phil. There goes the early exit. Dan enjoys it, though. He may not be able to say exactly what had happened, but it feels good to tell the audience about Phil&rsquo;s weird thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;He literally said the next day,&rdquo; Dan says, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;d been scared to wake me because sleepwalkers go crazy when they&rsquo;re woken up in horror films. Is that a thing? Like, what actually happens when someone who sleepwalks wakes up? Is it bad?&rdquo;</p><p>He sees messages roll in.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I used to sleepwalk and it was honestly terrifying</i>&rdquo;,</p><p>&ldquo;<i>My mum thought i was possessed by the amount of times she woke up seeing me stand at her bedside.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Dan reads out the second message.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s some supernatural shit. That&rsquo;s what Phil used to do as a child too. Can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve put myself at risk living with him.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan reads more messages, different theories and personal anecdotes coming in droves.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gonna google it,&rdquo; Dan says eventually.</p><p>He types it in the google search and hits enter.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, here we go.&rdquo;</p><p>He furrows his brow as he reads. The first result makes no sense.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>It is a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because it may cause them a heart attack, shock, brain damage, or something else. It is not a myth that it is dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker because of the possible injury the sleepwalker may inflict upon themselves or the person waking them up</i>,&rdquo; he reads quickly.</p><p>He makes a face as he processes the information.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he splutters. &ldquo;Is it a myth or not? Make up your mind.&rdquo;</p><p>He looks at the source.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>The Register</i>. Yeah. Get your facts straight. I read the first google result and I expect to be fully informed by the first hit, thank you very much.&rdquo;</p><p>He grins at his own joke. He accepts one of the premium messages.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Dan, they mean that while it may not cause any physical or emotional reaction it could be unsafe as the sleepwalker might be in a compromising position. Fall down or be holding something they could accidentally injure themselves with. I know because I once woke my sister up from sleepwalking and she almost fell down a flight of stairs.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods thoughtfully as he reads it out.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m stupid,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I totally interpreted that wrong, then. That does sound quite harrowing. I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t wake me up.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan has to let out a small laugh. Lying in bed is not technically sleepwalking, and if Phil had woken him up there would have been no risk of Dan accidentally injuring himself. It was a stupid topic to bring up, but it actually is starting to interest him.</p><p>He spends another few minutes looking up results and reading some of the viewers&rsquo; experiences. He ignores the messages that are worried about his health, advising him to go to bed on time and other solutions he&rsquo;s heard a million times before that would effectively improve his quality of sleep. He&rsquo;s not exactly bothered by it, he just doesn&rsquo;t think it applies to his situation. It had only been a wet dream after all.</p><p>He caves by reading someone&rsquo;s message that says they hope he&rsquo;s okay and trying his best to sleep better.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;That was a week ago and it hasn&rsquo;t happened since. No more possessed-Dan scenarios for Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>He drops the topic and goes on to read out the top fans. He doesn&rsquo;t take any last messages or question, he just thanks the viewers for watching. He tells them to drink some water, get out in the sun, and to remember to take a few moments to breathe. He smiles, says goodbye, and clicks the &ldquo;on air&rdquo; button. Afterwards he quietly checks to see if he&rsquo;s really off air. He puts the piece of tape back over his webcam and turns off the mic function on his computer. Might be a bit much, but the idea of accidentally staying live scares him enough to repeat that process after every liveshow.</p><p>He types a tweet thanking people for tuning in and posts it. He reads some of the replies that roll in. Someone&rsquo;s already quoted the whole sleepwalking scenario. He closes the laptop and sits in silence. Not long after he feels two hands come to squeeze his shoulders.</p><p>He leans his head back until it bumps Phil&rsquo;s stomach. Keeps it there while Phil massages him gently.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember seeing you in the kitchen,&rdquo; Phil says.</p><p>Dan sighs.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, now you&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hands work his shoulders steadily. Then his fingers come to softly slide up and down Dan&rsquo;s neck. He shudders visibly. His head immediately shifts. Something about the touch is always too much, always right between arousal and oversensitivity. But the fingers go further, pet into Dan&rsquo;s hair. Phil pulls his head back so that Dan looks at him.</p><p>Phil is in his pyjamas, hair pushed back, glasses on. He leans down and kisses Dan&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Been thinking about that night, have you?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>Dan smiles. He remembers that boneless feeling. How urgent Phil&rsquo;s erection had been in his hand. How it felt, stiff in his mouth. Something about tired sex was such a relief. The body hasn&rsquo;t tensed with the stress of a work day yet. The mind hasn&rsquo;t fully registered the environment. It hasn&rsquo;t recollected the thoughts that worried it the night before. It&rsquo;s easier to listen to your body, to go with it. To let yourself be handled by the man in your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil goes to sit on the bed. He pats his hand next to him and Dan immediately gets up for the silent invitation. He sits next to Phil and lets himself be touched. Over the shirt, squeezing one of Dan&rsquo;s pecks. They kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;I take it you have,&rdquo; Dan teases.</p><p>&ldquo;The way you just fucked into me,&rdquo; Phil recollects. &ldquo;Senselessly, all taken with it. It amused me at first, but then it was this weird combination of cute and hot at the same time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cute?&rdquo; Dan questions. &ldquo;You want me to be cute in bed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; Phil says.</p><p>His hand is still rubbing over Dan&rsquo;s chest. Completely just feeling him up, taking. Dan&rsquo;s used to it. Phil can&rsquo;t keep his hands to himself and he hasn&rsquo;t since they first met. It&rsquo;s still effective. Dan is half hard and leaning into the touches.</p><p>&ldquo;It was innocent,&rdquo; Phil elaborates. &ldquo;Innocent but at the same time, not at all. You were so needy for it even though you didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Dan says, smirk creeping onto his face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise you I&rsquo;ll do that in bed again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Phil shrugs. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. Anything you do is cute. And hot.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan has learned to accept that &lsquo;cute&rsquo; is a good thing in reference to himself. He despised that word for a long time. How his mum would patronizingly call him that well into his upper teens, while he was struggling with his identity and his masculinity. It wasn&rsquo;t until Phil started to say it that it felt good. Made him feel&hellip; precious, in a way.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I cute when I suck your dick?&rdquo; Dan teases.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmh,&rdquo; Phil sounds as he kisses Dan deeper. &ldquo;Super cute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like that?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s breath goes hot. &ldquo;Me with your tip in my mouth, have to ask for help? Until you get frustrated and fuck my mouth deep and come down my cute little throat?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shakes his head, breathing hard. He chuckles a little bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is that so hot coming out of your mouth?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmh,&rdquo; Dan grins. He puts his hand on Phil&rsquo;s crotch over his pyjama bottoms. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re hard there. Why are you? What happens if I..?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan squeezes softly. Phil&rsquo;s hips automatically thrust into the touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Ungh,&rdquo; he moans, as if in pain, against Dan&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Dan asks, playing hard into a sweet, gullible voice. &ldquo;Did I do something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Dan,&rdquo; Phil says, putting his hand on top of Dan&rsquo;s between his legs. He pushes Dan&rsquo;s hand down harder. &ldquo;You little tease. It feels amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Then what happens if I..?&rdquo;</p><p>He slips his hand under Phil&rsquo;s bottoms and softly touches his cock. He&rsquo;s not wearing any pants underneath. A drop of precum rolls down his shaft. Dan smooths his thumb over it, then pretends to be shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;Ew,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Are you peeing?&rdquo;</p><p>He still keeps his hand steady there. Phil groans, pushes on top of Dan until he&rsquo;s lying down on top of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;No, babe,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That means you&rsquo;re doing well. Feels so good.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil stutters as he says it. He seems so deliciously apprehensive, exploring this type of dirty talk. Like he&rsquo;s ashamed of liking it. Dan loves those kind of kinks the most. How he has to almost convince Phil that it&rsquo;s okay, that it&rsquo;s play.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh it does?&rdquo; Dan says, filling his voice with wonder. He squeezes a bit more. &ldquo;That feels good?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil makes another almost pained noise. He pulls Dan&rsquo;s hand off of his cock, out his bottoms. He throws his T-shirt off and pins Dan&rsquo;s wrists down on top of the mattress.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Dan asks, eyes big.</p><p>&ldquo;Thought you needed a lesson on teasing,&rdquo; Phil says.</p><p>The pressure of Phil on top of him is somethin Dan will never get used to. How the heavy body keeps him still. How those big hands tighten around his wrists. Dan keens at the sensation, can&rsquo;t keep up the pretense of not understanding when his cock is so hard. Phil fumbles out his bottoms and pulls Dan&rsquo;s T-shirt off over his head, then immediately returns to their original position.</p><p>&ldquo;Makes me wanna fuck you so bad,&rdquo; Phil breathes onto Dan&rsquo;s neck before he nips at the skin, pushing their cocks together.</p><p>Only the thin layer off cotton provided by Dan&rsquo;s joggers keep them from fully touching. Dan moans, voice pitching higher than normal.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says as his eyes shut. So many sensations. &ldquo;I feel weird down there. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Feel weird, do you?&rdquo; Phil asks, gruff voice against Dan&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;How could that be? Describe it to me&rdquo;</p><p>Fuck. Apparently Dan&rsquo;s not the only one that can tease. Phil pulls his hips back, refusing to grind them down. Dan looks up at him desperately. He needs that push.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to hurt you,&rdquo; Phil grins, studying Dan&rsquo;s frustrated expression. &ldquo;If you feel weird we might have take you to hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Phil,&rdquo; Dan breaks. It slips like a whisper out of his mouth.</p><p>Phil laughs again, low and inhibited. That fucking laugh. Dan loves it. He loves it during sex especially.</p><p>&ldquo;It feels&hellip;,&rdquo; Dan moans. &ldquo;Feels like a pressure. Really hard down there. I think my cock is getting stiff like yours. Can you take a look at it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Phil says, and pulls Dan&rsquo;s soft bottoms down and off swiftly.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s cock stands up, pink and hard. Phil lies next to Dan and just <i>looks</i> at it. Doesn&rsquo;t touch. Dan blinks up at Phil&rsquo;s face, then down at his own throbbing erection.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Tell me how it feels.&rdquo;</p><p>He puts his hand around it. Doesn&rsquo;t squeeze, just holds it.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hips push into Phil&rsquo;s hold. Fuck. This is so weird and good at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;It feels.. Oh, Phil. It feels good. It feels like you should do it more. <i>Harder</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>The last word is more of a command, more of Dan&rsquo;s normal voice. He needs Phil to just&hellip; stop fucking around and get to it. Phil is having way too much fun.</p><p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; Phil grins.</p><p>His hand slides easily up to the tip. He thumbs the slit of Dan&rsquo;s foreskin.</p><p>Dan moans low at that, hips going wild for a second to chase the feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;Easy does it,&rdquo; Phil says, and stills Dan&rsquo;s hips with a strong hand.</p><p>He comes back to Dan&rsquo;s cock once he&rsquo;s stopped moving. He slides it up and down, too light, too soft. Dan shivers against the touch. He can&rsquo;t help but bury his face in Phil&rsquo;s neck. So warm there, so close. He needs to get closer. Phil keeps up the light, slow pace. Dan rolls into Phil&rsquo;s side, fucks into Phil&rsquo;s grasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Feels really good,&rdquo; Dan sighs.</p><p>His hips go steady with the pace. Slow, slow. He lets his hand wander down to grasp Phil&rsquo;s stiff cock in his hand. He matches Phil&rsquo;s pace.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Phil sighs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my good boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan breathes hard against Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like that?&rdquo; he asks as he gently thumbs at the head. &ldquo;A-am I doing it right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So right,&rdquo; Phil says.</p><p>Dan pretends to search, unsure. Presses at the head. Drags his hand slowly down Phil&rsquo;s length. Phil&rsquo;s hips begin to move in a similar pace to Dan&rsquo;s. They eventually just end up pushing into each other&rsquo;s fists. Lazy, slow. Dan looks up from the comfort of Phil&rsquo;s neck and kisses his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;So pretty,&rdquo; Phil says once they part. &ldquo;So pretty for me.&rdquo;</p><p>It resonates in Dan, makes him go faster into Phil&rsquo;s fist.</p><p>&ldquo;You like that, sweetie?&rdquo; he asks, stealing another chaste kiss. &ldquo;Like it when I call you that?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan moans.</p><p>&ldquo;Nhyes,&rdquo; he whines. &ldquo;Please. Say it more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;d look real pretty with my cock in your mouth,&rdquo; Phil says, voice low.</p><p>Dan pretends to be taken aback.</p><p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; he asks, looking down at Phil&rsquo;s cock, still moving into Dan&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;In here?&rdquo;</p><p>He removes the hand and presses a finger to his bottom lip. He sucks at it, tastes some of Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Ohh yes,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;That mouth is so nice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;You taste good.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil groans, taken out of it a bit again. Stepping closer to that edge of shame. Dan just wants to savour that look on his face that doubts what they&rsquo;re doing. Whether it&rsquo;s hot and kinky or just weird. Phil removes his hand from around Dan&rsquo;s cock and pets Dan&rsquo;s cheek before he fingers through Dan&rsquo;s hair and starts to push him down forcefully.</p><p>Dan goes with it, stops when his face is level with Phil&rsquo;s dick. He takes a measuring look. Up and down, hesitant. He looks up at Phil for guidance.</p><p>&ldquo;Just,&rdquo; Phil takes his cock in hand and guides it to Dan&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Suck. Right there on the tip.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan keeps his eyes big, expression confused and wondrous as he looks at Phil&rsquo;s cock. It&rsquo;s leaking and hard. Then he closes his mouth softly around the head. Wet suction noises fill the room before he pulls off with a loud pop.</p><p>&ldquo;Something like that?&rdquo; Dan asks.</p><p>Phil is positively vibrating with want. He slides his cock over Dan&rsquo;s now closed lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Juuust like that,&rdquo; Phil encourages. &ldquo;Take it in your mouth, babe.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan resumes, sucking hesitantly. Never moving his head, just sucking right at that same spot. He pulls off, licks a little with a teasing smile. He sinks back down. Sucking hard, alternating by lolling his tongue over the tip.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Phil groans. &ldquo;Take it deeper.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan pretends not to understand. He keeps at what he&rsquo;s been doing, just to see Phil&rsquo;s increasing frustration make him weak with arousal. He puts his hand on Dan&rsquo;s head while he sucks and pushes him down slowly. Dan whines against it. The feeling of Phil&rsquo;s hand, strong and domineering in his hair, just taking everything. He sucks obediently. Phil pulls Dan up and down his cock by the hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like that,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Can you do that for me?&rdquo;</p><p>He lets go of Dan&rsquo;s hair and watches. Dan really wants to take Phil deep, let him hit the back of his throat. He wants to make Phil come so bad. But he pulls off again, resumes his suckling on the tip, alternating by licks. He knows it&rsquo;s not nearly enough. He knows it&rsquo;s agony, to be teetering on the edge of something and for it not to follow through. To not get that pressure. He waits until Phil is a whimpering, thrusting mess.</p><p>Dan pulls off.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Am I doing it wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shakes his head, not as an answer, but simply as a sign of disbelief and exasperation. He grabs Dan by the hair again.</p><p>&ldquo;Just fucking take it,&rdquo; he grunts and feeds his cock deep into Dan&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>In one swift movement, Phil&rsquo;s cock hits the back of Dan&rsquo;s throat. Dan gags loudly, eyes tearing up, but lets himself adjust to the sudden intrusion. It&rsquo;s different when Phil is the one commanding a deep throat. When Dan does it himself he has no problems. It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s made for it, not a hint of a gag reflex as he swallows Phil down deep and stays there, steadily breathing through his nose while Phil falls apart beneath him. No, this is different, and the sudden sound of a gag makes Phil&rsquo;s body shake with pleasure as he stares down at Dan.</p><p>Dan breaks the eye contact, cock still lodged down his throat, and whines pathetically around it. Phil pulls Dan&rsquo;s hair so that his mouth slides up and off his cock completely. Dan breathes shallowly through his mouth. A string of spit still connects Dan&rsquo;s bottom lip to the tip of Phil&rsquo;s cock.</p><p>Without saying anything, Phil pulls Dan&rsquo;s mouth onto his cock again and thrusts just as deeply into it. Dan doesn&rsquo;t gag this time, but there&rsquo;s still that unholy wet sound like a <i>click</i> as the head of Phil&rsquo;s cock settles deep there. Dan is practically shaking with satisfaction. Phil is so fucking hard and unforgiving by the way he just takes. He&rsquo;s using Dan like a toy. That doesn&rsquo;t happen frequently but in certain moments, like this one, it&rsquo;s perfect for both of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; Phil instructs.</p><p>His voice is strained. Dan looks up at Phil curiously, eyes still a bit wet from before. He blinks. Phil gasps as soon as their eyes lock. Another squelching sound from the back of Dan&rsquo;s throat as Phil&rsquo;s hips pull back a bit and push back in. Just an involuntary movement caused by the horny twitch of his hips. Phil moans, breath quickening a bit, as if he doesn&rsquo;t trust himself to be able to hold back anymore.</p><p>But he does. He pulls his cock out fully one more time and allows Dan to cough and clear his throat. Dan&rsquo;s overdoing it for the sake of teasing Phil. He&rsquo;s mastered the art of sucking dick since the time that that was the only thing they allowed themselves to do back in the day. The pretend coughs still work, though. Dan feels Phil&rsquo;s wet cock slide against the side of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Phil murmurs affectionately. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looks up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so big,&rdquo; he says and fakes an impossibly innocent expression on his face.</p><p>He moves his head softly to mouth at the shaft. Phil shudders yet again.</p><p>&ldquo;You like that down your throat, huh?&rdquo; Phil asks.</p><p>Dan nods wordlessly, eyes closing as he loses himself into the soft kisses he places on Phil&rsquo;s length. It&rsquo;s a stark contrast. Phil&rsquo;s cock is hard to the point that he could come immediately from the simple fast stroke of Dan&rsquo;s hand. Yet Dan keeps mouthing the side softly, like he has all the time in the world to leisurely explore every inch of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmh feels nice,&rdquo; Phil says, voice hoarse. &ldquo;Look so nice too.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looks back up at that, eyes crinkling with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;So cute when you take my cock,&rdquo; Phil continues.</p><p>His hands tighten in Dan&rsquo;s hair again. Pulls him away from his cock, but not far. He guides him to the tip, still not touching, and holds still.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s cock is trapped between his stomach and the mattress underneath. He&rsquo;s about to bust at just that one adjective, the one that&rsquo;s so strangely erotic within the context of sex.</p><p><i>Cute.</i></p><p>Dan breathes hard down onto Phil&rsquo;s cock and swallows, expecting his mouth to be filled at any second. Phil stalls long enough for Dan to look up eventually.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil says throatily as their eyes meet. &ldquo;Can I just fuck your throat and go buckwild?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan breathes in a ragged breath, eyes closing in an attempt to dull the pure need rippling through his body at the question. He has to laugh though. A short giggle, and his lips accidentally pillow on top of Phil&rsquo;s leaking slit.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Buckwild</i>,&rdquo; he imitates through a grin and pulls back a bit. &ldquo;What is this, a rodeo?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeehaw,&rdquo; Phil says weakly.</p><p>They lose it at that. Phil&rsquo;s hand disappears from Dan&rsquo;s hair and Dan&rsquo;s face slumps down to muffle his giggles against the soft skin in the crease between Phil&rsquo;s ball sack and leg. He looks up at Phil whose hands are fully covering his mouth, eyes glistening with laughter.</p><p>Phil shakes his head, hands coming undone from his mouth. One returns downward to pet the side of Dan&rsquo;s head and the other lies flat against the bed. Phil slumps his head down on the mattress and stares up at the ceiling as he breathes laboured breaths to stop from laughing. Dan&rsquo;s body is still shaking with it, but it slows as he pushes into Phil&rsquo;s gentle hand.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck is this?&rdquo; Phil ponders aloud, another giggle escaping his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; Dan murmurs, regaining some sense of reality.</p><p>The reality is that Phil&rsquo;s erection is still as urgent and it&rsquo;s poking at Dan&rsquo;s cheek and that is so hot he forgets to laugh anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Phil replies, pushing himself up onto his elbow in order to look at Dan. &ldquo;I hate how hot it is.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan mouths at Phil&rsquo;s shaft again. Slowly, leisurely.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I look cute?&rdquo; he teases.</p><p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; Phil moans.</p><p>The gentle hand comes powerful into Dan&rsquo;s hair again, guiding his lips to slide up and down the side of his cock. Dan breathes hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dan sighs. &ldquo;Yes, fuck my mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>He breathes another sigh as his mouth slides with more urgency just by the demanding force of Phil&rsquo;s hand in his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Go <i>buckwild</i>,&rdquo; Dan says, shooting a pointed look up at Phil.</p><p>Phil stretches his lips and bites the inside of his mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna fuck your throat so hard that I come any second and that is not a laughing matter,&rdquo; he says, mouth stretching wider as he struggles harder to keep his word.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmh,&rdquo; Dan moans exaggeratedly. &ldquo;Need to taste that cum.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s expression turns serious at that. He pulls Dan into the same position as before. Mouth just above his cock, begging to be stuffed full. Dan clears his throat and swallows, readying himself for what&rsquo;s to come. They lock eyes for a moment before Phil finally pulls Dan&rsquo;s head down and thrusts his hips up, creating a perfect, fast slide deep into Dan&rsquo;s tight throat.</p><p>He keeps Dan&rsquo;s head down for a few seconds as he fucks into that sweet spot right at the back of Dan&rsquo;s throat. Dan moans, voice almost lost, but the sound mixed with the wet squelch created by Phil repeatedly fucking into him creates an even rawer noise that makes Dan&rsquo;s cock twitch and leak where it&rsquo;s trapped and neglected against the mattress. Phil pulls Dan&rsquo;s head back, not completely off this time, and repeats the process. Each time it goes faster. Dan&rsquo;s nose right in the trail of hair at the small pudge of Phil&rsquo;s stomach. Phil sounds a string of desperate breaths, completely taken by sensation.</p><p>&ldquo;Gonna fucking come,&rdquo; he strains to say, &ldquo;so fucking hard down your pretty little throat, gonna fill it up &lsquo;til it spills right over with all that nasty cum.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan is really about to come untouched at those words. He inhales hard. Lets Phil keep going, going, going until he reaches that wonderful edge and floods Dan&rsquo;s mouth with the promised cum. Phil pulls back at that, and fucks shallowly into Dan&rsquo;s mouth as he spills and spills, a hard breath exhaled through his mouth. When his tense muscles eventually relax he moves Dan&rsquo;s mouth off his now oversensitive cock.</p><p>Dan breathes hard through his nose. Phil&rsquo;s hand pets him sweetly again, tilts Dan&rsquo;s chin up a bit to get a proper look.</p><p>&ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; Phil says.</p><p>Dan opens his mouth, shows off the pearly white cum that pools on his wet little tongue. Some of it spills down his chin. Dan closes his mouth and swallows, eyes soft up at Phil&rsquo;s. Phil traces the tiny wad of cum that slipped out, pushes it against Dan&rsquo;s skin as he guides it back into his mouth. Dan sucks gently at it and swallows.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good mouthful, babe,&rdquo; Phil sighs.</p><p>Dan is practically vibrating with the need to come. He pulls himself up on top of Phil fast and crashes his used mouth onto Phil&rsquo;s lips. Phil wraps his arm around Dan and moans.</p><p>&ldquo;Needy little boy,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Do you maybe need to come?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan collects himself a bit. The feeling of finally being able to slide his cock over Phil&rsquo;s stomach and getting some relief is going to make him crazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he responds. &ldquo;A little bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil giggles a laugh, but before long his hand pushes down between their bodies and wraps around Dan&rsquo;s dick. He squeezes tightly, just like Dan loves, and moves it slowly up and down. Dan whines, head falling onto Phil&rsquo;s neck as he desperately chases relief.</p><p>&ldquo;So good for me,&rdquo; Phil murmurs against Dan&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Gonna make you come all cute and warm on me.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan trembles. He fucks harder into Phil&rsquo;s fist in time with his movements. The slide becomes looser, faster up and down Dan now that he&rsquo;s close. Fast rhythmic thrusts pause into a stutter, a moment of stillness, as Dan&rsquo;s body tightens up completely and he finds himself biting down on Phil&rsquo;s neck. Then bliss overcomes him. Such wonderful relief, as all that tension and almost-shame that caused his arousal in the first place leaves him. Cum squirts all over Phil&rsquo;s stomach messily as he rides out the orgasm through high pitched moans and pathetic pumps of his hips.</p><p>Dan slumps on Phil&rsquo;s side, head coming to rest on his arm. He breathes hard for a bit. His dick is softening but still sensitive. Phil&rsquo;s hand is still there though, like a reassurance, almost an apology for not having touched it more during this. Dan smiles to himself at the thought.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re awful,&rdquo; Phil grins.</p><p>He turns to lie on his side and face Dan. They look into each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely filthy,&rdquo; Dan agrees. &ldquo;What would Kathryn say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Phil warns, staring.</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t unlike Dan to bring up either the most gruesome, innocent, or completely off-limit things during what&rsquo;s supposed to be the lovely afterglow of an orgasm. He can&rsquo;t help himself. Not when he&rsquo;s this loose and giddy and the words cause such a blunt reaction from Phil. He giggles, gives Phil a quick peck on the lips.</p><p>His hand comes down to touch Phil&rsquo;s cock again. It&rsquo;s softened completely. Dan looks into Phil&rsquo;s eyes with a devilish smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of your mum,&rdquo; he says quickly before he crashes his mouth on Phil&rsquo;s and licks into it, wet tongues clashing together in a completely impure kiss.</p><p>Phil pulls away laughing. He shakes his head and ruffles Dan&rsquo;s hair playfully.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you a hundred times to not start with that again,&rdquo; he complains.</p><p>Dan laughs heartily. He can&rsquo;t stop. Phil&rsquo;s reaction is too much.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he wheezes through laughter. &ldquo;Your face is just priceless.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil sighs, relaxing as he simply watches Dan laugh through fond eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fucking believe you said,&rdquo; the laughter rolls out of Dan, &ldquo;yeehaw during sex.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Check that off the bucket list,&rdquo; Phil says.</p><p>They lie close like that for a while, making stupid jokes and laughing together. At themselves, at their weirdness, and at how sexy all of it somehow is.</p></p>",
