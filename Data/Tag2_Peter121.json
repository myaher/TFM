                "content": "<p>So this was inspired by that adorable headcanon that Peter is super light because of the spider bite. Also bonus Rhodey just cause.</p><p><br /></p><p>Rhodey wasn&rsquo;t used to Peter in a bad mood. He was usually optimism personified, Tony&rsquo;s personal ray of sunshine.&nbsp;</p><p>But today, he was sullen and distracted, barely answering even direct questions and staring into space. Rhodey would have assumed he was just not as peppy as Rhodey had thought&ndash;it&rsquo;s not like he and Peter spent a ton of time together&ndash;but Tony was frowning over at him, too, a concerned crease between his eyebrows.</p><p>At one point, Peter walked to the kitchen and back out without stopping to grab anything, and then stood three feet from the couch, looking at his phone, as if he was so lost in thought he forgot to sit down.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Tony said quietly,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m intervening.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Rhodey motioned for him to go ahead, eager to get their excited, happy Peter back. He figured Tony would sit the kid down and coax him into spilling like the responsible parent he was slowly morphing into. Instead, Tony watched Peter for a moment as if analyzing him, then he ran forward in a crouch like a rugby player, scooped the kid into his arms, and <i>chucked </i>him onto the couch cushions.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter landed with a muffled&nbsp;&ldquo;oomph,&rdquo; his limbs flying everywhere. There was a beat of stillness where Rhodey&rsquo;s jaw dropped and Peter blinked in shock.</p><p>Then the kid threw back his head and laughed.</p><p>That was apparently what Tony was waiting for, because he darted forward and pinned Peter to the couch, half-sitting, half-laying on him to hold him still.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What the&ndash;&rdquo; Peter giggled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Tony said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, get off.&rdquo; He struggled against Tony&rsquo;s hold, but Rhodey knew it was only for show. The kid could throw Tony across the room without even trying if he really wanted to.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo; Tony was grinning, and even though it made the crows feet at the corners of his eyes more pronounced, he looked younger than he had in years.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crushing me,&rdquo; Peter wheezed dramatically.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I resent the implication&ndash;&rdquo; Tony caught both of Peter&rsquo;s wrists in one hand so he&rsquo;d stop halfheartedly pushing at Tony&rsquo;s chest&nbsp;&ldquo;&ndash;that I am heavier than a <i>building</i>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s groan was lost amid his laughter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Tony said, poking Peter in the side and making him squirm.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me, tell me, tell me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gah.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Rhodey wasn&rsquo;t even trying to hide how big he was smiling at this point, they were both totally oblivious to him anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tickle you til you tell me,&rdquo; Tony threatened.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I could just throw you off,&rdquo; Peter reminded him. His smile broadened. &ldquo;But you might break a hip.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, for that you get a wet willie.&rdquo; Tony raised a finger to his mouth and licked it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, that&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo; Peter protested, writhing more vigorously.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oscorp offered me a job!&rdquo; Peter finally admitted, desperate to avoid such a juvenile punishment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony froze, seemingly so shocked he forgot to release the kid&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked up at Tony, his face torn.&nbsp;&ldquo;An&hellip; an internship. In their biochemistry lab.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony finally sat back, letting Peter sit up. He was biting his lip.&nbsp;&ldquo;But&hellip; you already have an internship. Here.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I mean&hellip; not really. That&rsquo;s just what we tell people.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scoffed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Kid, what do you think all that time in the lab is? It&rsquo;s better experience than cleaning Osborn&rsquo;s petri dishes, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter fiddled with his phone.&nbsp;&ldquo;College applications are coming up. It&rsquo;d look really good.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony finally looked at Rhodey, as if remembering he was in the room for the first time. He looked a little heartbroken.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you&hellip; I mean, if you&rsquo;d rather work there, Pete, I won&rsquo;t&hellip; I won&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed, looking up Tony.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just&hellip; they said they could write me a really nice letter of recommendation so I can get a good scholarship.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony held up his hands in a time out sign.&nbsp;&ldquo;Woah, woah, woah.

But then this issue just dived right into that stuff.</p><p>Hoo-boy&hellip;this was not good.</p><p>Okay lets talk positives.</p><p>Juan Cabal remains a wonderful artist for this title. His\nart evokes Dodson and Cho&rsquo;s style from Marvel Knights and that&rsquo;s definitely a\ngood thing.</p><p>There are some cool visual effects to be found here in the\nform of the spider sense panel and the vibration effects of another panel.</p><p>There are some nice one liners and jokes, e.g. the Rumour\nhaving the force.</p><p>Spider-Man&rsquo;s three mile climb was a short but sweet example\nof his will power.</p><p>The Torch/Boomerang scene was funny.</p><p>The Rumour is a somewhat interesting character for being a\nsecret senior citizen superhero from the Golden Age. </p><p>There are 2 nice splash pages in this.</p><p>And that&hellip;is just about where the positives end.</p><p>Lets tackle the elephant in the comic.</p><p>Under York sucks shit.</p><p>Okay in fairness Under York isn&rsquo;t a bad concept, its a\nreally interesting sci-fi/fantasy concept unto itself but it has absolutely\nzero place in a goddam Spider-Man story.</p><p>Remember how the series was advertised as, the first issue\nimplied this series would be and the literal NAME of the comic would lead you\nto expect that this series would be about a very grounded, down to Earth\nSpider-Man dealing with slice of life stuff?</p><p>Yeah well apparently it&rsquo;s not so much down to Earth as\nsubterranean because we&rsquo;re entering a realm of sci-fi/fantasy Spider-Man doesn&rsquo;t\nbelong it 99% of the time and we are absolutely not in the middle of that 1%\ntime slot!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It comes off as an idea Tom Taylor had the hots for and\nwould&rsquo;ve done eventually in anything he wrote, Spider-Man or otherwise. Right\nnow it doesn&rsquo;t even seem like Spider-Man himself needs to be the focus of this\nstory, the mother, her kids and the Rumour are. This is basically a Marvel Team\nUp story now, and a bad one at that because Spider-Man isn&rsquo;t even teaming up\nwith anyone you&rsquo;d know since the Rumour is a new character!</p><p>I mean my God we have a Ministry of Magic esque elevator and\nthe last line of this comic is telling us a small war is about to happen.</p><p>Spider-Man writers quick tip: unless it&rsquo;s a gang war, no\nSpider-Man story should be about any kind of friggin war resulting from a\ndiplomatic incident!</p><p>I&rsquo;m not even sure if we have a villain yet. Was it the kids&rsquo;\ngrandpa? The currently unnamed orange skinned old guy. Was that him? If so what\na lame ass villain with a lame ass introduction.</p><p>Then there are smaller but still crappy things.</p><p>Johnny Storm simply not giving a shit about Peter&rsquo;s identity\nby walking in his apartment and saying he is Peter&rsquo;s friend.</p><p>Peter choosing to leap across the room and take a bullet for\nthe Rumour instead of using his webbing to either subdue the shooter or yank\nRumour out of the way.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s spider sense going off at all when that happens\nconsidering the gun was never aimed at HIM!</p><p>But earlier the Rumour reveals she learned his identity by\nsetting up a camera outside his window. Er&hellip;the spider sense 100% alerts him\nto stuff like that, hence he&rsquo;s maintained an secret identity for as long as he\nhas.</p><p>Its just not good and my hopes for this series have now been\ndashed. After such a strong debut issue we&rsquo;re entering the realm of bullshit.</p><p>Hooray!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>P.S. Its honestly lame as shit when you take something there\nis a real world history for and try to spin it as ACTUALLY being the result of\nthis fictional BS you&rsquo;ve come up with. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s Michael Bay\nclaiming the microchip happened because of Megatron, Magneto ACTUALLY killing\nJFK by accident because JFK was a mutant, or Hellboy 2004 claiming Hitler didn&rsquo;t\nreally die the way we all know he definitely did. Even when Stan and Jack did\nthe latter Marvel retconned it to later. So saying crap like the Empire State\nBuilding was actually an idea borrowed from this secret subterranean city who\nbuilt the Empire State Building FIRST is just obnoxious.</p></p>",

Granted it is alleviated by not having Peter and MJ there for\ndinner. It&rsquo;s still dumb seeing a scene out every YA TV drama or whatever play\nout with Lizard people. Were they not Lizard people though it&rsquo;d be perfectly\ndecent character drama.</p><p>Bachalo&rsquo;s art. Same complaints as last time except there\nwere points in this issue where I truly couldn&rsquo;t tell what the hell was\nhappening. At points Black Ant was barely in shot and I couldn&rsquo;t quite get the\nangle. The scene where Spider-Man, er&hellip;hits (?) Taskmaster is so poorly done I\nwasn&rsquo;t sure if he was headbutting him or not and regardless I couldn&rsquo;t tell\nwhat part of Taskmaster&rsquo;s face I was looking at. Also the linework is often\njust like soft and I poorly done.</p><p>Its just so obvious this was a fill-in job to plug the gap\nand get the books out on time. </p><p>That&rsquo;s really where my outright negatives end because this\nis a point that&rsquo;s sort of bad but also sort of good.</p><p>I talked in my last issue post about how the books have\nrecently been recycling art and how it doesn&rsquo;t jive well when the art styles\nare so different.</p><p>This issue suffers from that a bit on the last page becuse\nBachalo&rsquo;s crappy art is juxtaposed with what is either a very realistic drawing\nof or an outright photo of New York city and it just looks stupid.</p><p>However it&rsquo;s also used for a page that recycycles old art\nfrom the 1960s-1980s. And there it actually works.</p><p>I think that is because Bachalo&rsquo;s art is relatively minimal\non that page , the artwork in question is in greyscale and because (unlike with\nOttley&rsquo;s recycled art last issue) the art is so classical that it works it\nevokes the idea of a truly bygone age.

Peter\u2019s education is\nbeing given a second chance. Peter is giving Felicia and Jameson and Boomerang\na second chance.</p><p>Peter knows Connors is not a bad person, knows his acts of\nevil occurred under influence of the Lizard over whom he has had little control\nand Peter has shown sympathy towards him and similar people (e.g. Vermin) who\u2019ve\ndone truly horrific things because of those animalistic personalities their\npossess.</p><p>So Peter giving Curt a second chance when he seems to be in\ncontrol, seems to have some version of his old life back and is trying to make\namends (and has actively sought to help him personally) I think is believable.</p><p>And if Peter feels that way I think MJ has enough faith in\nhim to give it a second try too.</p><p>Problems crop up when it comes to the Martha and Billy\nclones though.</p><p>Remember these people were Peter and MJ\u2019s friends! They went\nout together they went to Billy\u2019s birthday. They mourned their deaths.</p><p>Seeing them alive and mutated should be a BIG deal and it\u2019s\ntreated with unrealistic blas\u00e9 casualness.</p><p>It\u2019d be one thing if the Connors and Parkers were not close\nand they merely intellectually knew these guys were clones. From that POV you\ncould argue Peter and Mj are just trying to be polite and recognize that if\nCurt is healthier and happier with these clones whom he treats as the real deal\nthen what harm is there in just leaving the topic alone and accepting them.</p><p>But&hellip;that\u2019s not the case. MJ and Martha were friends, Peter\nknew Billy and found his mutilated dead body. Seeing them both alive and\nmutated and knowing their not the real versions of the characters should\nemotionally affect them both, it should make them feel uncomfortable on some\nlevel.</p><p>If nothing else that\u2019s a fascinating moment to explore. But\ninstead we smash cut to them all hanging out in the sewers having dinner\ntogether as though it was nothing.</p><p>Now sure this is more of Spencer\u2019s comedy sensibilities\ncoming in because that visual and that scenario is innately absurd.</p><p>But it\u2019s an instance where the humour and absurdity really\ntakes you out of the story. Both for the reasons I spoke about above and also\nbecause frankly&hellip;this moment just doesn\u2019t belong in a Spider-Man story.</p><p>Spencer has been so much better than Slott at keeping\nSpider-Man grounded and although wacky things have happened they\u2019re been much\nmore forgivable or served a deeper point. Normally I\u2019d lambast splitting Peter\nand Spider-Man into 2 separate people as too wacky for Spider-Man, but because\nit served the purposes of character reconstruction it wound up being great.</p><p>Here though its just absurd and aggressively unrealistic for\na Spider-Man story for no deeper purpose. Not just the visual of a family of\nLizard people chowing down with the Parkers but also the fact that they\u2019re\nliterally in a sewer doing it and everyone is so casual about it.</p><p>It\u2019s just&hellip;stupid and ruins your immersion in the story. Its\ntoo absurd a thing for readers to just take on face value in a Spider-Man\nstory, like a Ninja Turtles story, maybe an F4 story maybe, but this no. </p><p>Especially with MJ of all people casually climbing into a\nsewer for dinner. I\u2019m not saying MJ is a delicate flower nor someone who can\u2019t\ngo low rent when she needs to but like there is accepting the low rent option\nand then there is this lady who is glamorous to a certain extent and likes\nbeing so willingly climbing into a friggin sewer to eat with a reforming cannibal\nlizard person and lizard clones of 2 dead people. Sorry, suspension of\ndisbelief doesn\u2019t stretch that far.</p><p>Another reductive aspect of the story is the continual\nlooming shadow of Parker Industries. As mentioned in older posts we need to\neither properly address and fix this so nobody mentions it again or else just\nhardcore ignore it, not bring it up as a legitimate story element but also kind\nof ignore it too.</p><p>You also have the bullshit \u2018mid-twenties\u2019 line which is\nabsolutely untrue and you should just No. Prize a reason for MJ to say that.</p><p>But other than that I\u2019ve got nothing bad to really say about\nthis issue. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing. It\u2019s all absolu-&hellip;well you know\nthere is one teeny tiny thing.</p><p><b><i>THE ART IS UTTERLY TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p>You know, I re-read some 1990s Generation X comics recently\nalong with their Age of Apocalypse counterparts, Generation Next. And the art\nin the latter was weaker than the former for sure.</p><p>But holy crap both of them looked\nsooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better than Shed which itself looked soooooo\nmuch better than this hot garbage.</p><p>Bachalo\u2019s art is at least readable in this story in ways it\noften was not in Shed but nevertheless it looks so scruffy and sketchy and just\nplain ugly.</p><p>I never thought I\u2019d MISS Humberto Ramos but my God. There\nare points where people faces in the distance look like they\u2019ve got just dots\nfor eyes and dashes. Everyone is so off model and unattractive and the art over\nall is grey, dark, washed out. A gross contrast to the art by Ramos and Ottley.</p><p>Its not even like the change is in service of a major tonal\nshift or anything. The tone of the story thus far isn\u2019t grimer or darker than\nwhat we had before. We didn\u2019t go into the sewers because we\u2019re dealing with\nsome grim and gross story, we went there for absurdity. </p><p>I mean there is a REASON Ottley did the cover for this issue\nand why the Spider-Office pulled out some stock art by Paolo Rivera for next\nissue\u2019s cover. Its because they were acutely aware that anyone looking at\nBachalo on the stands would never pick up these books on impulse.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t help when we reuse some stock art by Ottley for\none of the recap panels. That one panel is better than the rest of the art in\nthe book. </p><p>Although it raises another potential criticsm. Even during\nSpencer\u2019s debut arc we saw art recycled a little (Black Cat from issue #1 was\nreused later as Peter\u2019s phone picture for her). And the prior 2 issues reused\nart as well as I recall.

And the art\nin the latter was weaker than the former for sure.</p><p>But holy crap both of them looked\nsooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better than Shed which itself looked soooooo\nmuch better than this hot garbage.</p><p>Bachalo&rsquo;s art is at least readable in this story in ways it\noften was not in Shed but nevertheless it looks so scruffy and sketchy and just\nplain ugly.</p><p>I never thought I&rsquo;d MISS Humberto Ramos but my God. There\nare points where people faces in the distance look like they&rsquo;ve got just dots\nfor eyes and dashes. Everyone is so off model and unattractive and the art over\nall is grey, dark, washed out. A gross contrast to the art by Ramos and Ottley.</p><p>Its not even like the change is in service of a major tonal\nshift or anything. The tone of the story thus far isn&rsquo;t grimer or darker than\nwhat we had before. We didn&rsquo;t go into the sewers because we&rsquo;re dealing with\nsome grim and gross story, we went there for absurdity. </p><p>I mean there is a REASON Ottley did the cover for this issue\nand why the Spider-Office pulled out some stock art by Paolo Rivera for next\nissue&rsquo;s cover. Its because they were acutely aware that anyone looking at\nBachalo on the stands would never pick up these books on impulse.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t help when we reuse some stock art by Ottley for\none of the recap panels. That one panel is better than the rest of the art in\nthe book. </p><p>Although it raises another potential criticsm. Even during\nSpencer&rsquo;s debut arc we saw art recycled a little (Black Cat from issue #1 was\nreused later as Peter&rsquo;s phone picture for her). And the prior 2 issues reused\nart as well as I recall. Now those aren&rsquo;t that big of a deal but here it again\ntakes you out of the book because Ottley is at least reusing his own art who&rsquo;s\nstyle therefore matches up. Here Bachalo doesn&rsquo;t match us at all and it comes\noff as lazy.</p><p>Now there were GOOD things in the issue too. </p><p>Peter and Mj together, talking.</p><p>Resolving the Rhino&rsquo;s seeming return to villainy from older\nissues.</p><p>Aunt May being feisty and perhaps for the first time calling\nout a male suitor.</p><p>The clever safety device Peter gave her, even if it is\nperhaps too sci-fi.</p><p>Furthering along the Taskmaster/Black Ant/Kraven and ESU\nsubplots in a very organic way.</p><p>Spencer at least addressing why Aunt May isn&rsquo;t rolling in\nthe money after her rich husband died.</p><p>Aunt May&rsquo;s kindness</p><p>Spider-Man and Rhino&rsquo;s newfound friendship/working\nrelationship.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t wanna say\nthis is a bad issue but also&hellip;it has got genuinely bad things IN it&hellip;.</p></p>",

The wording was bitterly ironic, quite so nearly made it seem as if he was going on a round of drinks with coworkers and caught a woman&rsquo;s number, perhaps anything other than his current predicament, which was quite the opposite of what one would expect when Anthony Stark would even go about mentioning seeing someone: a therapist.</p><p>A story in which Stephen Strange threatens his license with a desire to grow closer towards his client, and in which Tony Stark really isn&rsquo;t mad about it.</p><p>Words: 2957, Chapters: 1/1, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe/works\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></li><li>Rating: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Explicit/works\">Explicit</a></li><li>Warnings: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Choose%20Not%20To%20Use%20Archive%20Warnings/works\">Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings</a></li><li>Categories: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/M*s*M/works\">M/M</a></li><li>Characters: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Steve%20Rogers/works\">Steve Rogers</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark/works\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Stephen%20Strange/works\">Stephen Strange</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker/works\">Peter Parker</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20%22Bucky%22%20Barnes/works\">James &ldquo;Bucky&rdquo; Barnes</a></li><li>Relationships: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20Stark*s*Stephen%20Strange/works\">Tony Stark/Stephen Strange</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20%22Bucky%22%20Barnes*s*Steve%20Rogers/works\">James &ldquo;Bucky&rdquo; Barnes/Steve Rogers</a></li><li>Additional Tags: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/IronStrange/works\">IronStrange</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Stephen%20Strange%20-%20Freeform/works\">Stephen Strange - Freeform</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/tony%20stark%20-%20Freeform/works\">tony stark - Freeform</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Stony%20-%20Freeform/works\">Stony - Freeform</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Stucky%20-%20Freeform/works\">Stucky - Freeform</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/therapist/works\">therapist</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tony%20has%20PTSD/works\">Tony has PTSD</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Slow%20Burn/works\">Slow Burn</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/tony%20is%20a%20single%20parent/works\">tony is a single parent</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Baby%20Peter/works\">Baby Peter</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Peter%20Parker%20-%20Freeform/works\">Peter Parker - Freeform</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/therapist%20stephen/works\">therapist stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/ill%20add%20tags%20eventually%20as%20it%20progresses/works\">ill add tags eventually as it progresses</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/NDKFNS%20also%20stephen%20is%20a%20vegan/works\">NDKFNS also stephen is a vegan</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/he%20is%20literally%20a%20hipster/works\">he is literally a hipster</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/tony%20eats%20pizza%20rolls%20and%20destroys%20his%20life%201%20step%20at%20a%20time/works\">tony eats pizza rolls and destroys his life 1 step at a time</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Eventual%20Smut/works\">Eventual Smut</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/u%20gotta%20wait%20bros%20%F0%9F%98%94%F0%9F%98%94/works\">u gotta wait bros &#128532;&#128532;</a></li></ul><br /><br />\nread it on the AO3 at <strong><a href=\"https://ift.tt/2IE8RqI\">https://ift.tt/2IE8RqI</a></strong></p>",
