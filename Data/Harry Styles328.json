You two met in London months ago. You live in Camden and you go to the same grocery store every morning before work. Recently you noticed a young man, always in a hoodie with big sunglasses. You saw him from far a few times, and you knew he&rsquo;s familiar, but he always broke contact when he saw that you&rsquo;re staring at him. One day, you were picking apples and a man stood next to you, picking apples too. It was a hand you recognised. The little tattoo and the rings. You froze. With slow movements, you raised your eyes to see him. You stared at each other for long seconds. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m not gonna tell anyone\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat you&rsquo;re here. That you&rsquo;re in London. In a Camden supermarket. Every day\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d he said and smiled. \u201cI truly appreciate it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wanna buy me a coffee?\u201d You asked. He laughed. </p><p>\u201cSure, let&rsquo;s pay for these first\u201d he said. </p><p>After you left the store, you sat in a cafe near. You chatted for an hour and it turned out he comes every day to see you. You were flattered. You met every day since that day. Sometimes in the grocery store or in a cafe, eventually in a restaurant. But you two always stayed low key. After three months he asked if you would be his girlfriend. You happily said yes. Harry wanted to take you home to his mother,and Anne persuaded him to stay a whole week. It&rsquo;s been three days since you arrived and enjoyed your stay very much. Anne was lovely. </p><p>You and Harry have been together for months now, but you still haven&rsquo;t had your first kiss. </p><p>After lunch, Harry took you out in the park to just walk around. You held hands and walked between trees that were playing in beautiful colours from yellow to maroon. It was picturesque. He stopped by a huge tree. </p><p>\u201cY/N, would you let me have your first kiss here, under this tree?\u201d he asked. You smiled stupidly. </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d you said softly. You two leaned closer to each other. Then you suddenly moved back. </p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have to wait\u201d you said and started crazily searching for something in your pockets. Harry just stood there, being confused. You finally found it. You took a peppermint candy out of your pocket. </p><p>\u201cI won&rsquo;t let you kiss me like this. There was onion in the salad. My breath\u2026\u201d you said and started eating the candy.</p><p>\u201cReally? I don&rsquo;t care &hellip;really\u201d he whined. </p><p>\u201cYou have to wait until I finish\u201d you said and noticeably ate. </p><p>Harry groaned but then he laughed. </p><p>\u201cI can&rsquo;t believe you. You silly, it makes me love you even more\u201d he said and hugged you. </p><p>\u201cHarry\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished\u201d </p><p>\u201cFinally\u201d </p><p>He cupped your face and leaned closer.

You two met in London months ago. You live in Camden and you go to the same grocery store every morning before work. Recently you noticed a young man, always in a hoodie with big sunglasses. You saw him from far a few times, and you knew he\u2019s familiar, but he always broke contact when he saw that you\u2019re staring at him. One day, you were picking apples and a man stood next to you, picking apples too. It was a hand you recognised. The little tattoo and the rings. You froze.

Harry wanted to take you home to his mother,and Anne persuaded him to stay a whole week. It\u2019s been three days since you arrived and enjoyed your stay very much. Anne was lovely. </p><p>You and Harry have been together for months now, but you still haven\u2019t had your first kiss. </p><p>After lunch, Harry took you out in the park to just walk around.

Angsty as hell, teen!harry, X factor!harry, best friend!harry.</p><p>\u00a0***\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Y/N and Harry shared everything: a street, toys, friends and even a birthday (Feb, 1, 1994) just as their mothers had. Given that they were also childhood best friends. Y/N and Harry had been friends for years \u2014 but then, the X Factor happened\u2026 Y/N hated those 3 words. They were the words that had changed the entire dynamic of their relationship; as both friends and as a couple. Well\u2026 as much of a \u201ccouple\u201d as love sick 16 year olds could be. They\u2019d dated for just over a year before he auditioned for the X Factor. They had been each other\u2019s first everything: first kiss, first real person, first time and of course, first heartbreak. First he broke hers. It happened when news broke that he had made it past the first round of auditions. </p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cI made it, Y/N.\u201d he\u2019d said. It was totally casual and caught her by surprise. They were lying in his family\u2019s living room in Holmes Chapel watching The Notebook with Gemma, Anne and Robin. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>She shot up straight from her position on his lap. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cW-what?\u201d She gasped. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cI made the X Factor.\u201d He said, sitting up to pause the film. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cO-oh. That\u2019s great! I knew you could do it, H!\u201d She stammered hugging him close. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re moving to London.\u201d He mumbled. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cWait\u2026 what?\u201d She questioned. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re moving to London, Y/N. as long as I\u2019m in the competition I need to be on set, and because I\u2019m not 18 mum and Robin need to be with me on set.\u201d He murmured. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cOh\u2026 well London\u2019s only 3 hours away. I could come visit on weekends.\u201d She quipped. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, love. That\u2019s a pretty big commitment. We can\u2019t even drive yet, and that\u2019s a lot to expect from your parents.\u201d </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cYou could just tell me you don\u2019t want this anymore Harry. I don\u2019t need your pathetic excuses.\u201d She cried rushing out of the living room. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cY/N, honey! Come back please!\u201d Anne called out. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cBABY PLEASE!\u201d Harry cried running barefoot down his cobblestone drive. But it was no use, she was gone. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>Over the next few weeks before he left for London, H made every attempt to contact Y/N. He waited for her at her locker at school, outside of her classes, showed up at her doorstep every morning before school with his famous iced tea that she loved so much and everyday she would walk right past him as if he were some stranger passing her on the street. She\u2019d even resorted to blocking his number on her mobile and not allowing her mother to answer their home phone when his number showed up on the caller ID. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>Eventually he learned his lesson and stopped attempting to contact her. But not before he could leave a note in her locker before he left for London. </i></p>\n\n<p><b>\u201cY/N, </b></p>\n\n<p><b>I\u2019m so sorry baby. I didn\u2019t mean what I said the way it sounded. Please let me explain.</b></p>\n\n<p><b>I love you, </b></p>\n\n<p><b>H.\u201d </b></p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n\n<p>It had been nearly 3 months since Harry had made any more attempts to contact Y/N, and she had made no attempts at all to reciprocate those attempts. But nonetheless, it still broke her heart to even think about Harry in the arms of another girl \u2014 let alone an older woman\u2026 not to mention a woman 14 years his senior! It was sickening. She tried her hardest not to pay attention to the rumours and wanted nothing more than believe they were false, but when every media outlet in the UK was reporting about the supposed relationship between \u201c16 year old X Factor contestant Harry Styles and the host Caroline Flack, aged 30\u201d the rumours became rather hard to ignore. But she had to see for herself, so one weekend, close to the show finale, she decided to take Anne up on one of her multiple offers to make the trip to London because \u201cHarry was dying to see her.\u201d She, Anne and Gemma decided to surprise Harry and meet him at Nando\u2019s one evening to surprise him with her visit, only to see him show up hand in hand at the restaurant with her. </p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s when Y/N truly decided to let Harry go. She no longer tuned into the competition, deleted him on all social media and no longer hung-out with the friend group they shared at school. Instead she became a secluded introvert, only going from school to work. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014 8 years later (January, 28, 2018) \u2014\u2014</p><!-- more -->\n\n<p>It\u2019s been 8 years since Harry and Y/N had physically laid eyes on one another. Not even at Robin\u2019s wake or service. She went of course she did. He was almost as much of, if not more of a father to her than her own dad, she just sat in the back and only made her presence known to Anne and Gemma when Harry was no longer in the room. She decided to unblock his number for a short while and send him her condolences on Robin\u2019s passing, but then she was back to ignoring him. That doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s a stranger to her ex boyfriend\u2019s crazy success and scandalous relationships. She\u2019s run into  Anne now and again when she was out and about in Holmes Chapel visiting her mother. She also still had the occasional girl\u2019s day in London with Gemma whenever their schedules meshed properly. </p>\n\n<p>She\u2019d moved there 6 years ago when she was 18 after being accepted to Oxford for (your choice in major). She decided to stay in town after she graduated, she received a job offer with a salary that was impossible to pass up just weeks after graduation. </p>\n\n<p>Soon after she started her new job was when she met Kyle. The way they met was kind of serendipitous, if you will. She\u2019d literally spilt her iced tea on him after they collided turning a corner on the street. They\u2019d been inseparable ever since. He\u2019s been her everything for the past 6 years. Which is amazing, considering she never thought she\u2019d feel this way about another man ever again. Not after he broke her heart all those years ago. Anne and Gemma were happy for her, but would be happier if it were Harry she were still with. They liked Kyle enough though, he treated her well and that\u2019s all they ever wanted for her. </p>\n\n<p>Now, four days before their shared 24th birthday she\u2019s sitting on the sofa in the flat she shared with Kyle trying to get Gemma off the phone. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cGem, how many times do I need to tell you I. Don\u2019t. Want. A. Party. 24 is no special occasion. I\u2019m not 16, or 18 or 21. \u2018M just another year older. Can\u2019t we just go to Greece for a weekend? Just the 2 of us and the mums?\u201d (Anne and Y/M/N). Y/N begs. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUgh. Fine. I guess, if that\u2019s what you want. But are you sure you don\u2019t want anything on your actual birthday? Y\u2019know like dinner or summat?\u201d Gemma questions. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUm, no. I think Kyle\u2019s taking me to Gordon Ramsey\u2019s new restaurant in Chelsea that night. Think he wants it to be a surprise though. I over heard him making the reservation a few weeks back.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, I know the place. Fancy little bloke inn\u2019he?\u201d She giggles finding her own sense of humour rather amusing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHa ha, Gem. Laugh it up. S\u2019more than you can say H\u2014-\u201c Y/N stops herself just before her friend\u2019s brother\u2019s name leaves her lips. \u201cNever mind. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d She retracts. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, Y/N, S\u2019okay. I get it. Know he\u2019s m\u2019brother and what he did was a while back but it still makes him a wanker.\u201d Gem agrees. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call you in a few days to sort out the details of the trip, Gem. Talk soon.\u201d Y/N smiles. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cLaters, baby.\u201d Gemma laughs. </p>\n\n<p>\u20144 days later, Birthday evening (Feb, 1, 2018) Gordon Ramsey\u2019s restaurant.\u2014</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWow, Ky. This place is amazing, you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Y/N gasps as the hostess brings them to their table and informs them their server will be by shortly to take their orders. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCourse I should, love. S\u2019not every day the girl you love turns 24.\u201d Kyle smirks. </p>\n\n<p>Just as the sommelier (wine expert) approaches their table. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, are you Miss. Y/L/N?\u201d He questions. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUm yes? What is this about?\u201d She asks sheepishly, confused. Kyle himself seeming just as clueless. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is for you. Compliments of the gentleman over there at table 4. Enjoy your meal. This pairs lovely with the prime rib, if I do say so myself.\u201d The wine master smiles as he departs from the table. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N looks over Kyle\u2019s shoulder to see the one and only Harry Styles smirking at her from across the dining room. \u201cHappy Birthday, love\u201d he mouths, lifting his own glass of wine in a \u201ccheers\u201d salute. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Kyle I need to take care of something really quickly.\u201d Y/N says, giving her date a tight lipped smile before marching over to Harry and hauling him up from the table by the cuff of his Gucci suit jacket. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOi, love. That\u2019s no way to greet an old friend on his birthday is it?\u201d Harry jabs as she continues to maneuver them out the main doors of the restaurant. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFirst of all a $300 bottle of wine? Are you freaking kidding me, Harry? Second of all\u2026 s\u2019tha\u2019 all I am to you, an\u2019 \u201cold friend?\u201d And third, how the bloody freaking \u2018ell did you find me?

The same one he hasn\u2019t seen in nearly 8 years. But seeing her here, tonight looking gorgeous as ever in that tight black dress and killer Louboutins, with him?? Well that was a hell of a kick in the nads. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy did you really come here, Harry? Because I know it wasn\u2019t just to give me expensive wine and say happy birthday. But if it was, happy birthday, Harry. Goodbye.\u201d Y/N mutters, shaking her head and walking away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cN-no, baby please! Don\u2019t walk away. Not again.\u201d He begs grabbing at Y/N\u2019s wrist and pulling her into him. \u201cPlease, baby. I love you. Don\u2019t walk away again. If you do, I don\u2019t think I can take it.\u201d He says, full on sobbing now and literally begging on his knees outside the busiest restaurant in the Chelsea district, not caring who sees him. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cGet up, Harry. You\u2019re making a scene. Im not your baby anymore. I haven\u2019t been for the last 8 years. And that was your choice. I loved you, but I love Kyle, now. I\u2019d still like to be friends though, yeah?\u201d Y/N says in an attempt to plaster a fake sad smile on her face and look away from Harry to wipe her own tears. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot Harry to you baby. \u2018M anything but. What happened to H or babe or love or handsome?? Anything but Harry. That makes it too real. You know we can never be friends. We\u2019ve been through too much.\u201d  He sobs, standing up to hug her again. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cM\u2019sorry, H. I love Kyle and he\u2019s inside waiting. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around yeah?\u201d She says, releasing herself from his embrace and kissing his cheek before reentering the restaurant and leaving Harry out in the cold. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n\n<p>Fin??

Not even at Robin\u2019s wake or service. She went of course she did. He was almost as much of, if not more of a father to her than her own dad, she just sat in the back and only made her presence known to Anne and Gemma when Harry was no longer in the room. She decided to unblock his number for a short while and send him her condolences on Robin\u2019s passing, but then she was back to ignoring him. That doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s a stranger to her ex boyfriend\u2019s crazy success and scandalous relationships. She\u2019s run into  Anne now and again when she was out and about in Holmes Chapel visiting her mother. She also still had the occasional girl\u2019s day in London with Gemma whenever their schedules meshed properly. </p>\n\n<p>She\u2019d moved there 6 years ago when she was 18 after being accepted to Oxford for (your choice in major). She decided to stay in town after she graduated, she received a job offer with a salary that was impossible to pass up just weeks after graduation. </p>\n\n<p>Soon after she started her new job was when she met Kyle. The way they met was kind of serendipitous, if you will. She\u2019d literally spilt her iced tea on him after they collided turning a corner on the street. They\u2019d been inseparable ever since. He\u2019s been her everything for the past 6 years. Which is amazing, considering she never thought she\u2019d feel this way about another man ever again. Not after he broke her heart all those years ago. Anne and Gemma were happy for her, but would be happier if it were Harry she were still with. They liked Kyle enough though, he treated her well and that\u2019s all they ever wanted for her. </p>\n\n<p>Now, four days before their shared 24th birthday she\u2019s sitting on the sofa in the flat she shared with Kyle trying to get Gemma off the phone. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cGem, how many times do I need to tell you I. Don\u2019t. Want. A. Party. 24 is no special occasion. I\u2019m not 16, or 18 or 21. \u2018M just another year older. Can\u2019t we just go to Greece for a weekend? Just the 2 of us and the mums?\u201d (Anne and Y/M/N). Y/N begs. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUgh. Fine. I guess, if that\u2019s what you want. But are you sure you don\u2019t want anything on your actual birthday? Y\u2019know like dinner or summat?\u201d Gemma questions. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUm, no. I think Kyle\u2019s taking me to Gordon Ramsey\u2019s new restaurant in Chelsea that night. Think he wants it to be a surprise though. I over heard him making the reservation a few weeks back.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, I know the place. Fancy little bloke inn\u2019he?\u201d She giggles finding her own sense of humour rather amusing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHa ha, Gem. Laugh it up. S\u2019more than you can say H\u2014-\u201c Y/N stops herself just before her friend\u2019s brother\u2019s name leaves her lips. \u201cNever mind. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d She retracts. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, Y/N, S\u2019okay. I get it. Know he\u2019s m\u2019brother and what he did was a while back but it still makes him a wanker.\u201d Gem agrees. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call you in a few days to sort out the details of the trip, Gem. Talk soon.\u201d Y/N smiles. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cLaters, baby.\u201d Gemma laughs. </p>\n\n<p>\u20144 days later, Birthday evening (Feb, 1, 2018) Gordon Ramsey\u2019s restaurant.\u2014</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWow, Ky. This place is amazing, you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Y/N gasps as the hostess brings them to their table and informs them their server will be by shortly to take their orders. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCourse I should, love. S\u2019not every day the girl you love turns 24.\u201d Kyle smirks. </p>\n\n<p>Just as the sommelier (wine expert) approaches their table. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, are you Miss. Y/L/N?\u201d He questions. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUm yes? What is this about?\u201d She asks sheepishly, confused. Kyle himself seeming just as clueless. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is for you. Compliments of the gentleman over there at table 4. Enjoy your meal. This pairs lovely with the prime rib, if I do say so myself.\u201d The wine master smiles as he departs from the table. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N looks over Kyle\u2019s shoulder to see the one and only Harry Styles smirking at her from across the dining room. \u201cHappy Birthday, love\u201d he mouths, lifting his own glass of wine in a \u201ccheers\u201d salute. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Kyle I need to take care of something really quickly.\u201d Y/N says, giving her date a tight lipped smile before marching over to Harry and hauling him up from the table by the cuff of his Gucci suit jacket. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOi, love. That\u2019s no way to greet an old friend on his birthday is it?\u201d Harry jabs as she continues to maneuver them out the main doors of the restaurant. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFirst of all a $300 bottle of wine? Are you freaking kidding me, Harry? Second of all\u2026 s\u2019tha\u2019 all I am to you, an\u2019 \u201cold friend?\u201d And third, how the bloody freaking \u2018ell did you find me? Especially tonight of all nights?\u201d She whisper yells as they gat far enough into the parking lot. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne, happy birthday. I know you love that wine. He probably would\u2019ve ordered you some cheap $50 merlot. Two, no love, yer much more to me than just and old friend. S\u2019what I came ere to tell yeh.

They were the words that had changed the entire dynamic of their relationship; as both friends and as a couple. Well\u2026 as much of a \u201ccouple\u201d as love sick 16 year olds could be. They\u2019d dated for just over a year before he auditioned for the X Factor. They had been each other\u2019s first everything: first kiss, first real person, first time and of course, first heartbreak. First he broke hers. It happened when news broke that he had made it past the first round of auditions. </p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cI made it, Y/N.\u201d he\u2019d said. It was totally casual and caught her by surprise. They were lying in his family\u2019s living room in Holmes Chapel watching The Notebook with Gemma, Anne and Robin. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>She shot up straight from her position on his lap. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cW-what?\u201d She gasped. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cI made the X Factor.\u201d He said, sitting up to pause the film. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cO-oh. That\u2019s great! I knew you could do it, H!\u201d She stammered hugging him close. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re moving to London.\u201d He mumbled. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cWait\u2026 what?\u201d She questioned. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cWe\u2019re moving to London, Y/N. as long as I\u2019m in the competition I need to be on set, and because I\u2019m not 18 mum and Robin need to be with me on set.\u201d He murmured. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cOh\u2026 well London\u2019s only 3 hours away. I could come visit on weekends.\u201d She quipped. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know, love. That\u2019s a pretty big commitment. We can\u2019t even drive yet, and that\u2019s a lot to expect from your parents.\u201d </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cYou could just tell me you don\u2019t want this anymore Harry. I don\u2019t need your pathetic excuses.\u201d She cried rushing out of the living room. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cY/N, honey! Come back please!\u201d Anne called out. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>\u201cBABY PLEASE!\u201d Harry cried running barefoot down his cobblestone drive. But it was no use, she was gone. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>Over the next few weeks before he left for London, H made every attempt to contact Y/N. He waited for her at her locker at school, outside of her classes, showed up at her doorstep every morning before school with his famous iced tea that she loved so much and everyday she would walk right past him as if he were some stranger passing her on the street. She\u2019d even resorted to blocking his number on her mobile and not allowing her mother to answer their home phone when his number showed up on the caller ID. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>Eventually he learned his lesson and stopped attempting to contact her. But not before he could leave a note in her locker before he left for London. </i></p>\n\n<p><b>\u201cY/N, </b></p>\n\n<p><b>I\u2019m so sorry baby. I didn\u2019t mean what I said the way it sounded. Please let me explain.</b></p>\n\n<p><b>I love you, </b></p>\n\n<p><b>H.\u201d </b></p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n\n<p>It had been nearly 3 months since Harry had made any more attempts to contact Y/N, and she had made no attempts at all to reciprocate those attempts. But nonetheless, it still broke her heart to even think about Harry in the arms of another girl \u2014 let alone an older woman\u2026 not to mention a woman 14 years his senior! It was sickening. She tried her hardest not to pay attention to the rumours and wanted nothing more than believe they were false, but when every media outlet in the UK was reporting about the supposed relationship between \u201c16 year old X Factor contestant Harry Styles and the host Caroline Flack, aged 30\u201d the rumours became rather hard to ignore. But she had to see for herself, so one weekend, close to the show finale, she decided to take Anne up on one of her multiple offers to make the trip to London because \u201cHarry was dying to see her.\u201d She, Anne and Gemma decided to surprise Harry and meet him at Nando\u2019s one evening to surprise him with her visit, only to see him show up hand in hand at the restaurant with her. </p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s when Y/N truly decided to let Harry go. She no longer tuned into the competition, deleted him on all social media and no longer hung-out with the friend group they shared at school. Instead she became a secluded introvert, only going from school to work. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014 8 years later (January, 28, 2018) \u2014\u2014</p>[[MORE]]\n\n<p>It\u2019s been 8 years since Harry and Y/N had physically laid eyes on one another. Not even at Robin\u2019s wake or service. She went of course she did. He was almost as much of, if not more of a father to her than her own dad, she just sat in the back and only made her presence known to Anne and Gemma when Harry was no longer in the room. She decided to unblock his number for a short while and send him her condolences on Robin\u2019s passing, but then she was back to ignoring him. That doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s a stranger to her ex boyfriend\u2019s crazy success and scandalous relationships. She\u2019s run into  Anne now and again when she was out and about in Holmes Chapel visiting her mother. She also still had the occasional girl\u2019s day in London with Gemma whenever their schedules meshed properly. </p>\n\n<p>She\u2019d moved there 6 years ago when she was 18 after being accepted to Oxford for (your choice in major). She decided to stay in town after she graduated, she received a job offer with a salary that was impossible to pass up just weeks after graduation. </p>\n\n<p>Soon after she started her new job was when she met Kyle. The way they met was kind of serendipitous, if you will. She\u2019d literally spilt her iced tea on him after they collided turning a corner on the street. They\u2019d been inseparable ever since. He\u2019s been her everything for the past 6 years. Which is amazing, considering she never thought she\u2019d feel this way about another man ever again. Not after he broke her heart all those years ago. Anne and Gemma were happy for her, but would be happier if it were Harry she were still with. They liked Kyle enough though, he treated her well and that\u2019s all they ever wanted for her. </p>\n\n<p>Now, four days before their shared 24th birthday she\u2019s sitting on the sofa in the flat she shared with Kyle trying to get Gemma off the phone. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cGem, how many times do I need to tell you I. Don\u2019t. Want. A. Party. 24 is no special occasion. I\u2019m not 16, or 18 or 21. \u2018M just another year older. Can\u2019t we just go to Greece for a weekend? Just the 2 of us and the mums?\u201d (Anne and Y/M/N). Y/N begs. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUgh. Fine. I guess, if that\u2019s what you want. But are you sure you don\u2019t want anything on your actual birthday? Y\u2019know like dinner or summat?\u201d Gemma questions. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUm, no. I think Kyle\u2019s taking me to Gordon Ramsey\u2019s new restaurant in Chelsea that night. Think he wants it to be a surprise though. I over heard him making the reservation a few weeks back.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, I know the place. Fancy little bloke inn\u2019he?\u201d She giggles finding her own sense of humour rather amusing. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cHa ha, Gem. Laugh it up. S\u2019more than you can say H\u2014-\u201c Y/N stops herself just before her friend\u2019s brother\u2019s name leaves her lips. \u201cNever mind. Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d She retracts. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, Y/N, S\u2019okay. I get it. Know he\u2019s m\u2019brother and what he did was a while back but it still makes him a wanker.\u201d Gem agrees. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call you in a few days to sort out the details of the trip, Gem. Talk soon.\u201d Y/N smiles. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cLaters, baby.\u201d Gemma laughs. </p>\n\n<p>\u20144 days later, Birthday evening (Feb, 1, 2018) Gordon Ramsey\u2019s restaurant.\u2014</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWow, Ky. This place is amazing, you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Y/N gasps as the hostess brings them to their table and informs them their server will be by shortly to take their orders. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCourse I should, love. S\u2019not every day the girl you love turns 24.\u201d Kyle smirks. </p>\n\n<p>Just as the sommelier (wine expert) approaches their table. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, are you Miss. Y/L/N?\u201d He questions. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cUm yes? What is this about?\u201d She asks sheepishly, confused. Kyle himself seeming just as clueless. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is for you. Compliments of the gentleman over there at table 4. Enjoy your meal. This pairs lovely with the prime rib, if I do say so myself.\u201d The wine master smiles as he departs from the table. </p>\n\n<p>Y/N looks over Kyle\u2019s shoulder to see the one and only Harry Styles smirking at her from across the dining room. \u201cHappy Birthday, love\u201d he mouths, lifting his own glass of wine in a \u201ccheers\u201d salute. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Kyle I need to take care of something really quickly.\u201d Y/N says, giving her date a tight lipped smile before marching over to Harry and hauling him up from the table by the cuff of his Gucci suit jacket. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOi, love. That\u2019s no way to greet an old friend on his birthday is it?\u201d Harry jabs as she continues to maneuver them out the main doors of the restaurant. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFirst of all a $300 bottle of wine? Are you freaking kidding me, Harry? Second of all\u2026 s\u2019tha\u2019 all I am to you, an\u2019 \u201cold friend?\u201d And third, how the bloody freaking \u2018ell did you find me? Especially tonight of all nights?\u201d She whisper yells as they gat far enough into the parking lot. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOne, happy birthday. I know you love that wine. He probably would\u2019ve ordered you some cheap $50 merlot. Two, no love, yer much more to me than just and old friend. S\u2019what I came ere to tell yeh. And three, I\u2019m Harry freaken Styles, love. There\u2019s nothin I can\u2019t do. Not to mention Gordon owed me a favour after I performed at his daughter\u2019s graduation last year. When Gem told me yer new bloke was bringing yeh ere tonight I decided to call in that favour.\u201d Harry smiles, taking in the appearance of the girl he\u2019s loved for the last 20 some-odd years of his life. The same one he hasn\u2019t seen in nearly 8 years. But seeing her here, tonight looking gorgeous as ever in that tight black dress and killer Louboutins, with him?? Well that was a hell of a kick in the nads. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy did you really come here, Harry? Because I know it wasn\u2019t just to give me expensive wine and say happy birthday. But if it was, happy birthday, Harry. Goodbye.\u201d Y/N mutters, shaking her head and walking away. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cN-no, baby please! Don\u2019t walk away. Not again.\u201d He begs grabbing at Y/N\u2019s wrist and pulling her into him. \u201cPlease, baby. I love you. Don\u2019t walk away again. If you do, I don\u2019t think I can take it.\u201d He says, full on sobbing now and literally begging on his knees outside the busiest restaurant in the Chelsea district, not caring who sees him. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cGet up, Harry. You\u2019re making a scene. Im not your baby anymore. I haven\u2019t been for the last 8 years. And that was your choice. I loved you, but I love Kyle, now. I\u2019d still like to be friends though, yeah?\u201d Y/N says in an attempt to plaster a fake sad smile on her face and look away from Harry to wipe her own tears. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot Harry to you baby. \u2018M anything but. What happened to H or babe or love or handsome?? Anything but Harry. That makes it too real. You know we can never be friends. We\u2019ve been through too much.\u201d  He sobs, standing up to hug her again. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cM\u2019sorry, H. I love Kyle and he\u2019s inside waiting. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around yeah?\u201d She says, releasing herself from his embrace and kissing his cheek before reentering the restaurant and leaving Harry out in the cold. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n\n<p>Fin?? But could definitely see this being a small series if you all like it! There are plenty of places I could go with this! xx M.</p>",

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>\n\nWarnings</b>: not proofed. Angsty as hell, teen!harry, X factor!harry, best friend!harry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;***&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Y/N and Harry shared everything: a street, toys, friends and even a birthday (Feb, 1, 1994) just as their mothers had. Given that they were also childhood best friends. Y/N and Harry had been friends for years &mdash; but then, the X Factor happened&hellip; Y/N hated those 3 words. They were the words that had changed the entire dynamic of their relationship; as both friends and as a couple. Well&hellip; as much of a &ldquo;couple&rdquo; as love sick 16 year olds could be. They&rsquo;d dated for just over a year before he auditioned for the X Factor. They had been each other&rsquo;s first everything: first kiss, first real person, first time and of course, first heartbreak. First he broke hers. It happened when news broke that he had made it past the first round of auditions. </p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;I made it, Y/N.&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said. It was totally casual and caught her by surprise. They were lying in his family&rsquo;s living room in Holmes Chapel watching The Notebook with Gemma, Anne and Robin. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>She shot up straight from her position on his lap. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; She gasped. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;I made the X Factor.&rdquo; He said, sitting up to pause the film. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;O-oh. That&rsquo;s great! I knew you could do it, H!&rdquo; She stammered hugging him close. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving to London.&rdquo; He mumbled. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;Wait&hellip; what?&rdquo; She questioned. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving to London, Y/N. as long as I&rsquo;m in the competition I need to be on set, and because I&rsquo;m not 18 mum and Robin need to be with me on set.&rdquo; He murmured. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; well London&rsquo;s only 3 hours away. I could come visit on weekends.&rdquo; She quipped. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, love. That&rsquo;s a pretty big commitment. We can&rsquo;t even drive yet, and that&rsquo;s a lot to expect from your parents.&rdquo; </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;You could just tell me you don&rsquo;t want this anymore Harry. I don&rsquo;t need your pathetic excuses.&rdquo; She cried rushing out of the living room. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, honey! Come back please!&rdquo; Anne called out. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>&ldquo;BABY PLEASE!&rdquo; Harry cried running barefoot down his cobblestone drive. But it was no use, she was gone. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>Over the next few weeks before he left for London, H made every attempt to contact Y/N. He waited for her at her locker at school, outside of her classes, showed up at her doorstep every morning before school with his famous iced tea that she loved so much and everyday she would walk right past him as if he were some stranger passing her on the street. She&rsquo;d even resorted to blocking his number on her mobile and not allowing her mother to answer their home phone when his number showed up on the caller ID. </i></p>\n\n<p><i>Eventually he learned his lesson and stopped attempting to contact her. But not before he could leave a note in her locker before he left for London. </i></p>\n\n<p><b>&ldquo;Y/N, </b></p>\n\n<p><b>I&rsquo;m so sorry baby. I didn&rsquo;t mean what I said the way it sounded. Please let me explain.</b></p>\n\n<p><b>I love you, </b></p>\n\n<p><b>H.&rdquo; </b></p>\n\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>\n\n<p>It had been nearly 3 months since Harry had made any more attempts to contact Y/N, and she had made no attempts at all to reciprocate those attempts. But nonetheless, it still broke her heart to even think about Harry in the arms of another girl &mdash; let alone an older woman&hellip; not to mention a woman 14 years his senior! It was sickening. She tried her hardest not to pay attention to the rumours and wanted nothing more than believe they were false, but when every media outlet in the UK was reporting about the supposed relationship between &ldquo;16 year old X Factor contestant Harry Styles and the host Caroline Flack, aged 30&rdquo; the rumours became rather hard to ignore. But she had to see for herself, so one weekend, close to the show finale, she decided to take Anne up on one of her multiple offers to make the trip to London because &ldquo;Harry was dying to see her.&rdquo; She, Anne and Gemma decided to surprise Harry and meet him at Nando&rsquo;s one evening to surprise him with her visit, only to see him show up hand in hand at the restaurant with her. </p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s when Y/N truly decided to let Harry go. She no longer tuned into the competition, deleted him on all social media and no longer hung-out with the friend group they shared at school. Instead she became a secluded introvert, only going from school to work. </p>\n\n<p>&mdash;&mdash; 8 years later (January, 28, 2018) &mdash;&mdash;</p>\n</p>",

How had time flown this quickly already? All he knew was that he sat with Y/N and they talked about anything and everything while her best friend mingled with his band. \u201cOh wow, time flies, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d She blushed, resting her hands in her lap, \u201cIt does.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow are you going back home? I can give you a ride if you don\u2019t have one.\u201d Harry asked with care, straightening his posture on the stool and just something so small almost made her blush yet again. </p><p>She shook her head, \u201cI have a ride waiting outside. Besides, wouldn\u2019t be exactly safe for you to drive. I think we drank like a hundred of whatever this is.\u201d She laughed as she looked at her empty cup that was filled with blue and green liquor just 5 minutes ago. </p><p>And despite them not taking rides together, he still walked her outside \u2014 alongside Farrah who was too busy giving someone a drunk phone call that her best friend would make sure to tease her about the following day.</p><p>The back exit was quiet and empty, only one blue car with a driver who looked 40 and a man beside him there. It wasn\u2019t until the Princess informed Harry that \u201cBen and Sid are right there\u201d that he seemed to snap out of his trance; he was walking the Princess of Wales to her car which had a driver and her own guard. </p><p>\u201cTake care of your head now.\u201d She said quietly to her best friend who got inside the car and plopped in the backseat, releasing an exaggerated groan that made both, Y/N and Harry to chuckle. Turning to look at him, Harry looked at her so warmly. She gave him a bashful smile and put her hands in her back pockets, swaying side to side so slightly in her place, \u201cThank you for tonight. I really enjoyed it. The show and our talk at the bar and all.\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s lips only seemed to stretch more in a smile, clasping his hands behind his back and tipping his head, \u201cIt was an honor, your highness.\u201d The posh manner in his act made her giggle and good heavens did Harry\u2019s stomach erupt in butterflies. </p><p>Deciding to blurt out what ran through his head, his eyebrows were raised \u201cI hope I can get to see you more?\u201d </p><p>The butterflies went both ways in that moment. \u201cI hope I can get to see you more, too. When you aren\u2019t, you know, touring the world and selling out arenas and all,\u201d She replied, \u201cNot that I would mind!\u201d She quickly added.</p><p>Harry laughed, shaking his head at her, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you more when you aren\u2019t going around, helping the human race and all that,\u201d He waved his hand jokingly and rolled his eyes, laughing along when she did, \u201cBut really, uh, seeing you would be nice. You know, seeing you again. For coffee or tea, not sure which do you prefer but I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you asking for my number?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHave been for the past hour but thanks for noticing.\u201d He scratched his neck, glancing at his boots before looking at her to see her trying to stifle her smile. </p><p>Cursing herself under her breath for being oblivious, she gave him a nod, \u201cHere, give me your phone.\u201d </p><p>With a fluttering heart and blushing cheeks, Harry gave her his phone. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, won\u2019t give it to anyone.\u201d He joked.</p><p>\u201cOh God, thank you. I was totally thinking about that,\u201d She waved him off jokingly before handing him his phone back, \u201cThere. Goodnight, Harry. Thank you again for tonight.\u201d She bashfully tucked her hair behind her ear with a shy smile.</p><p>Harry smiled back, debating whether he should wrap his arms around her in a hug or not, \u201cNo worries. Thank you for coming, added more to the experience.\u201d </p><p>She giggled and before they both know it, she reached forward, wrapping her own arms around him in a quick hug, \u201cBye\u201d being the only whisper her lips muttered before she got in the car and went down the road. </p><p>//</p><p>They had been texting nonstop. </p><p>From \u201cGood morning\u201ds to \u201cGoodnight\u201ds and some \u201cDo you think I should match these two for tonight?\u201d in between. </p><p>It went on for exactly 24 days. 24 days of Harry sending her selfies of him sticking his tongue or grinning with his eyes shut or the crowd from backstage before his shows. 24 days of her responding with a picture of her paper piled desk or her best friends\u2019 figures in front of the big telly screen and they\u2019re watching a chickflick or a selfie of her with her mouth in an \u201cO\u201d. </p><p>It took Harry 24 days to text her one night, prior to him coming back to England for 3 days; </p><p><i>\u201cWould you like to have dinner with me tomorrow? x\u201d </i></p><p>and her to reply with: </p><p><i>\u201cI would absolutely like that (: x\u201d </i></p><p>So with her 3 girl friends on her bed, nodding and shaking their heads to her clothing options, The Princess was nervously running around as she was getting ready for her dinner with the lanky man who was able to get her to blush beetroot red via text messages. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N. You\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d Was what Emma said the moment their eyes fell on the ready-to-go young woman who was looking down at her dress. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1037\" data-orig-width=\"397\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9a68a38abb75db3a38129fc98fb8f56/tumblr_inline_pb0e0wnlam1scqand_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1037\" data-orig-width=\"397\"/></figure><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She chuckled nervously, touching her hair, \u201cDoes this wing look like the other?\u201d She closed her eyes, showing her friends. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d Farrah exclaimed, holding up her best friend\u2019s phone for her to see. The lockscreen showing a new text from \u2018Harry\ud83c\udf37\u2019 that said \u201c<i>I\u2019m right outside. xx</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe sent her two x\u2019s.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBitch, it\u2019s love.\u201d </p><p>With their teasing right behind her and following her to the door, they still bid her good luck and goodbye. </p><p>Walking out of the back gates, she spotted him leaning on his car. His suit looking pleasing for the eye, small smirk that was anything but cocky on his face.

I can give you a ride if you don\u2019t have one.\u201d Harry asked with care, straightening his posture on the stool and just something so small almost made her blush yet again. </p><p>She shook her head, \u201cI have a ride waiting outside. Besides, wouldn\u2019t be exactly safe for you to drive. I think we drank like a hundred of whatever this is.\u201d She laughed as she looked at her empty cup that was filled with blue and green liquor just 5 minutes ago. </p><p>And despite them not taking rides together, he still walked her outside \u2014 alongside Farrah who was too busy giving someone a drunk phone call that her best friend would make sure to tease her about the following day.</p><p>The back exit was quiet and empty, only one blue car with a driver who looked 40 and a man beside him there. It wasn\u2019t until the Princess informed Harry that \u201cBen and Sid are right there\u201d that he seemed to snap out of his trance; he was walking the Princess of Wales to her car which had a driver and her own guard. </p><p>\u201cTake care of your head now.\u201d She said quietly to her best friend who got inside the car and plopped in the backseat, releasing an exaggerated groan that made both, Y/N and Harry to chuckle. Turning to look at him, Harry looked at her so warmly. She gave him a bashful smile and put her hands in her back pockets, swaying side to side so slightly in her place, \u201cThank you for tonight. I really enjoyed it. The show and our talk at the bar and all.\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s lips only seemed to stretch more in a smile, clasping his hands behind his back and tipping his head, \u201cIt was an honor, your highness.\u201d The posh manner in his act made her giggle and good heavens did Harry\u2019s stomach erupt in butterflies. </p><p>Deciding to blurt out what ran through his head, his eyebrows were raised \u201cI hope I can get to see you more?\u201d </p><p>The butterflies went both ways in that moment. \u201cI hope I can get to see you more, too. When you aren\u2019t, you know, touring the world and selling out arenas and all,\u201d She replied, \u201cNot that I would mind!\u201d She quickly added.</p><p>Harry laughed, shaking his head at her, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you more when you aren\u2019t going around, helping the human race and all that,\u201d He waved his hand jokingly and rolled his eyes, laughing along when she did, \u201cBut really, uh, seeing you would be nice. You know, seeing you again.

I was totally thinking about that,\u201d She waved him off jokingly before handing him his phone back, \u201cThere. Goodnight, Harry. Thank you again for tonight.\u201d She bashfully tucked her hair behind her ear with a shy smile.</p><p>Harry smiled back, debating whether he should wrap his arms around her in a hug or not, \u201cNo worries. Thank you for coming, added more to the experience.\u201d </p><p>She giggled and before they both know it, she reached forward, wrapping her own arms around him in a quick hug, \u201cBye\u201d being the only whisper her lips muttered before she got in the car and went down the road. </p><p>//</p><p>They had been texting nonstop. </p><p>From \u201cGood morning\u201ds to \u201cGoodnight\u201ds and some \u201cDo you think I should match these two for tonight?\u201d in between. </p><p>It went on for exactly 24 days. 24 days of Harry sending her selfies of him sticking his tongue or grinning with his eyes shut or the crowd from backstage before his shows. 24 days of her responding with a picture of her paper piled desk or her best friends\u2019 figures in front of the big telly screen and they\u2019re watching a chickflick or a selfie of her with her mouth in an \u201cO\u201d. </p><p>It took Harry 24 days to text her one night, prior to him coming back to England for 3 days; </p><p><i>\u201cWould you like to have dinner with me tomorrow? x\u201d </i></p><p>and her to reply with: </p><p><i>\u201cI would absolutely like that (: x\u201d </i></p><p>So with her 3 girl friends on her bed, nodding and shaking their heads to her clothing options, The Princess was nervously running around as she was getting ready for her dinner with the lanky man who was able to get her to blush beetroot red via text messages. </p><p>\u201cFuck, Y/N.

                "content": "<p><h1>First Date. [The Royal Series]</h1><p><b>Summary: Princess Y/N and Harry&rsquo;s first date. </b></p><p><i>Warning: I suck at writing dates but this had to get out of the way. </i></p><p><i>Also this wouldn&rsquo;t make sense if you hadn&rsquo;t read The Royal Series I guess so&hellip;</i></p><p>//</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, uh, I sadly have to go.&rdquo; The princess frowned after looking up from her phone and locking eyes with the man she had seen performing on stage 4 hours ago. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s smile faltered and he slumped on the bar stool, &ldquo;Oh, uh, already?&rdquo; </p><p>She chuckled, leaning her chin on her palm as her elbow rested on the bar counter, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 2 am.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was surprised. How had time flown this quickly already? All he knew was that he sat with Y/N and they talked about anything and everything while her best friend mingled with his band. &ldquo;Oh wow, time flies, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; She blushed, resting her hands in her lap, &ldquo;It does.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How are you going back home? I can give you a ride if you don&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo; Harry asked with care, straightening his posture on the stool and just something so small almost made her blush yet again. </p><p>She shook her head, &ldquo;I have a ride waiting outside. Besides, wouldn&rsquo;t be exactly safe for you to drive. I think we drank like a hundred of whatever this is.&rdquo; She laughed as she looked at her empty cup that was filled with blue and green liquor just 5 minutes ago. </p><p>And despite them not taking rides together, he still walked her outside &mdash; alongside Farrah who was too busy giving someone a drunk phone call that her best friend would make sure to tease her about the following day.</p><p>The back exit was quiet and empty, only one blue car with a driver who looked 40 and a man beside him there. It wasn&rsquo;t until the Princess informed Harry that &ldquo;Ben and Sid are right there&rdquo; that he seemed to snap out of his trance; he was walking the Princess of Wales to her car which had a driver and her own guard. </p><p>&ldquo;Take care of your head now.&rdquo; She said quietly to her best friend who got inside the car and plopped in the backseat, releasing an exaggerated groan that made both, Y/N and Harry to chuckle. Turning to look at him, Harry looked at her so warmly. She gave him a bashful smile and put her hands in her back pockets, swaying side to side so slightly in her place, &ldquo;Thank you for tonight. I really enjoyed it. The show and our talk at the bar and all.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s lips only seemed to stretch more in a smile, clasping his hands behind his back and tipping his head, &ldquo;It was an honor, your highness.&rdquo; The posh manner in his act made her giggle and good heavens did Harry&rsquo;s stomach erupt in butterflies. </p><p>Deciding to blurt out what ran through his head, his eyebrows were raised &ldquo;I hope I can get to see you more?&rdquo; </p><p>The butterflies went both ways in that moment. &ldquo;I hope I can get to see you more, too. When you aren&rsquo;t, you know, touring the world and selling out arenas and all,&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Not that I would mind!&rdquo; She quickly added.</p><p>Harry laughed, shaking his head at her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you more when you aren&rsquo;t going around, helping the human race and all that,&rdquo; He waved his hand jokingly and rolled his eyes, laughing along when she did, &ldquo;But really, uh, seeing you would be nice. You know, seeing you again. For coffee or tea, not sure which do you prefer but I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you asking for my number?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Have been for the past hour but thanks for noticing.&rdquo; He scratched his neck, glancing at his boots before looking at her to see her trying to stifle her smile. </p><p>Cursing herself under her breath for being oblivious, she gave him a nod, &ldquo;Here, give me your phone.&rdquo; </p><p>With a fluttering heart and blushing cheeks, Harry gave her his phone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, won&rsquo;t give it to anyone.&rdquo; He joked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh God, thank you. I was totally thinking about that,&rdquo; She waved him off jokingly before handing him his phone back, &ldquo;There. Goodnight, Harry. Thank you again for tonight.&rdquo; She bashfully tucked her hair behind her ear with a shy smile.</p><p>Harry smiled back, debating whether he should wrap his arms around her in a hug or not, &ldquo;No worries. Thank you for coming, added more to the experience.&rdquo; </p><p>She giggled and before they both know it, she reached forward, wrapping her own arms around him in a quick hug, &ldquo;Bye&rdquo; being the only whisper her lips muttered before she got in the car and went down the road. </p><p>//</p><p>They had been texting nonstop. </p><p>From &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;s to &ldquo;Goodnight&rdquo;s and some &ldquo;Do you think I should match these two for tonight?&rdquo; in between. </p><p>It went on for exactly 24 days. 24 days of Harry sending her selfies of him sticking his tongue or grinning with his eyes shut or the crowd from backstage before his shows. 24 days of her responding with a picture of her paper piled desk or her best friends&rsquo; figures in front of the big telly screen and they&rsquo;re watching a chickflick or a selfie of her with her mouth in an &ldquo;O&rdquo;. </p><p>It took Harry 24 days to text her one night, prior to him coming back to England for 3 days; </p><p><i>&ldquo;Would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow? x&rdquo; </i></p><p>and her to reply with: </p><p><i>&ldquo;I would absolutely like that (: x&rdquo; </i></p><p>So with her 3 girl friends on her bed, nodding and shaking their heads to her clothing options, The Princess was nervously running around as she was getting ready for her dinner with the lanky man who was able to get her to blush beetroot red via text messages. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Y/N. You&rsquo;re gorgeous.&rdquo; Was what Emma said the moment their eyes fell on the ready-to-go young woman who was looking down at her dress. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9a68a38abb75db3a38129fc98fb8f56/tumblr_inline_pb0e0wnlam1scqand_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; She chuckled nervously, touching her hair, &ldquo;Does this wing look like the other?&rdquo; She closed her eyes, showing her friends. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; Farrah exclaimed, holding up her best friend&rsquo;s phone for her to see. The lockscreen showing a new text from &lsquo;Harry&#127799;&rsquo; that said &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m right outside. xx</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He sent her two x&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bitch, it&rsquo;s love.&rdquo; </p><p>With their teasing right behind her and following her to the door, they still bid her good luck and goodbye. </p><p>Walking out of the back gates, she spotted him leaning on his car. His suit looking pleasing for the eye, small smirk that was anything but cocky on his face. His green, emerald eyes almost looked like they&rsquo;d illuminate in the dark, something that the Princess found herself thinking about frequently. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22f4d48d3575118b9760364842d0c65b/tumblr_inline_pb0e5jTIHK1scqand_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s punctual.&rdquo; She informed in a teasing manner once she approached him, his smile widening when he took in her appearance.
