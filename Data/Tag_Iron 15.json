        "answer": "<p>Here you go! Thank you for this! xx. - MJ</p><!-- more --><p><b><br/></b>Peter was staring down the barrel of a gun.<b><br/></b></p><p>That\u2019s when it dawned on him, <i>oh, oh yeah, I am neck deep in shit. </i></p><p>See, no matter which way he swung this, he\u2019d still get his ass handed to him on a silver platter. If not by this gunman then by Aunt May or Tony; whichever one got to him first. It was hours passed his curfew but he was awakened by the police scanner beside his bed, reporting a jewelry store heist happening only a few blocks over. Queens was sizable city and a robbery was happening only a few blocks from where he lived. How could he not go? Aunt May couldn\u2019t possibly get mad at him for doing his job. It was only 2 AM and he\u2019d only be around the corner. Come on, that was pure Spider-Man luck. </p><p>It turned out the sensation he thought was luck was apparently indigestion from Aunt May\u2019s meatloaf because so far nothing was going his way. Two armed thieves had been webbed up but the third had ran leaving him alone with one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bulletproof,\u201d Peter began, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cBut please, don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d The suit was bulletproof, sure, but that didn\u2019t mean getting shot wouldn\u2019t still hurt like hell. There was still flesh under all that nanotechnology. How would he explain bullet indentations to Mr. Stark? </p><p>The gunman smiled behind the ski mask, trailing the gun from his head and to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI will kill you.\u201d He cocked the gun. \u201cAnd history can decide whether I am the hero or the villain.\u201d </p><p>Peter shuddered. That sounded like something out of a James Bond movie. It would be kind of cool, if, <i>y\u2019know</i>, he didn\u2019t have a gun aimed at his chest. </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeahyeahyeah</i>, cool, cool, cool. I hear you, I do. But listen, I just had this suit dry cleaned and it would be a shame if you scuffed it with your bullets. So can we skip all the <i>shooty-shooty</i> stuff and jump to where I arrest you and then disappear into the sunrise?\u201d Peter slowly began tip backwards out of the door frame where the glass had been shattered. Faintly, in the distance, he could hear sirens nearing and behind him repulsors cut out and metal crunched the concrete behind him. Oh no. Papa Bear Stark was on the scene. </p><p>Suddenly, the gun was no longer trained on him but on the figure behind him. Immediately, bullets began to rain around him; the cacophonous <i>ping!</i> of metal bouncing off of metal filling the sleeping city. </p><p>\u201cGet behind me, Peter!\u201d Wait\u2026that was\u2026Peter spared a glance over his shoulder. \u201cUncle Colonel Rhodes?\u201d Peter immediately dove behind the commander. \u201cWhat are you doing here, sir?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSaving your ass, kid, Outta my way.\u201d War Machine stepped around Peter. Within seconds, the gunman was unarmed, cuffed and being guided to the police car out front. Hey, he could\u2019ve done that! </p><p>The fly back to Tower was mostly silence, aside from Peter\u2019s occasional protests that he wasn\u2019t injured and he preferred to sneak back into his apartment and go to bed before school tomorrow. </p><p>\u201cNope, Tony requested that he see you <i>personally</i>.\u201d Any other day, Peter would\u2019ve burst open like a pinata of joy under any other circumstance but he just felt throat constrict with panic. They landed outside on the launching pad, starting for the sliding doors. </p><p>\u201cBut I had it under control, Mr. Rhodes, sir! I mean, you saw! The dude with the gun was all like \u2018I\u2019ll make you pay, <i>blargh</i>!\u2019 and I was like \u2018Stop! I\u2019m Spider-Man!\u2019 And then, then you came in! You were like \u2018I\u2019ve come to steal your thunder, Parker.\u2019 Then the gun dude started shooting, all like <i>bratatata</i>! <i>Pshhew! Vvvvrr-</i>-\u201d Rhodey clapped a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cYeah Peter, I was there.\u201d Rhodey disengaged the suit and tugged off Peter\u2019s mask. \u201cI know what happened.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt sounds like it was a blast!\u201d Peter whirled to his left where Tony was leaning against the door frame, clapping slowly. \u201cReal bang-up job, kid.\u201d Tony sauntered forwards, clapping a hand on James\u2019 shoulders. \u201cThanks, Rhodey. I got it from here.\u201d </p><p>Colonel nodded and cast a bleak glance at Peter before walking inside. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark! I was fine and I had everything under control\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPipe down, Minnie Mouse.

I was fine and I had everything under control&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pipe down, Minnie Mouse. I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But Mr. St&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can it, Squirt!&rdquo; Peter blinked. It was rare that Tony ever raised his voice but it got the job done. Shocked and wide eyed, Peter stood at attention. &ldquo;Riddle me this, Superman. How does a superhero protect his country, his state&ndash;<i> his neighborhood</i>, if he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter swallowed audibly. It was a rhetorical but Tony seemed to be waiting for an answer. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He <i>can&rsquo;t</i>. You can&rsquo;t be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if you let someone use you as target practice.&rdquo; Tony ran a hand over his face. &ldquo;Peter, the 5-0 handle things like this. Theft, vandalism, murder. That&rsquo;s stuff for the civilians. You need to learn to gauge the urgency of a situation. Walk little old ladies across the street, and save kittens from trees. But don&rsquo;t walk into gunfire! You have to stop putting your life on the line unnecessarily! You need to stop putting your life on the line, <i>period</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, where were you, Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice rose out of him without much thought. &ldquo;<i>Huh</i>? Where were you then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;At home! Just like you should&rsquo;ve been. I was home with one of my children, praying that my other one made it back safely! Oh, and trying to calm your aunt, who you scared the shit out of, mind you.&rdquo; Tony jabbed a thumb over his shoulder and Peter looked inside. In the doorway, stood Aunt May in her pajamas, holding his police radio. <i>Oh shit. </i>&ldquo;So next time you think it&rsquo;ll be fun to go dance the tango with an armed criminal, please, give someone a warning first.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence hung thickly between the two of them. Peter broke first, hanging his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know you are, but go tell that to your aunt.&rdquo; Tony tugged Peter into a hug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter let out a breath he didn&rsquo;t know he was holding. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go talk to May.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna be grounded until you&rsquo;re 30, I can tell you that.&rdquo; Tony snickered. </p><p>Peter winced. Yeah, he had seen that coming. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh goodie.&rdquo; </p>",

        "body": "<p>Where did he go wrong?</p><p>A cloud of glimmering silver bubbles raced past him to the surface. His world, once clear and vibrant with a plethora of colors and sounds, was now darkening with the color blue, a monotonous pounding ruthlessly crashing into his head.<br/></p><p>Steve&rsquo;s orders were clear. He was to infiltrate a GAIA ship and disable its communications. Incapacitate all enemies. Gather intel for SHIELD review. Leave. Debrief.<br/></p><p>\tGreen-gold scales filled his vision, a tail twirling and flicking with minimal effort. The vice grip on his legs grew tighter. Pain flared just above his ankles; the merman&rsquo;s claws dug deep into his skin, constantly slicing his flesh with each movement of his tail.<br/></p><p>\tSteve expected to be intercepted at any time. It&rsquo;s happened before, it&rsquo;ll happen again. He did not expect a man to slam him over the railing of the ship and plunge in after him. Steve had lashed out with his shield, the metal slicing through the water, but it hit nothing. He kicked, again and again, but the sharp hands always returned.<br/></p><p>\tThe merman yanked him downwards with such force that bubbles shot out of Steve&rsquo;s mouth; in an instant a clawed hand wrapped itself around his throat. Pain exploded behind his eyes when the man slammed Steve&rsquo;s head against the sandy floor.<br/></p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become unbelievably annoying, Captain.&rdquo; The merman&rsquo;s voice rang clear in the blue. His name was Ross Sweinden, Steve remembered, one of GAIA&rsquo;s packs of muscle. They had met before, only a week ago, when Ross had nearly bested him in combat. Steve was impressed, he respected Ross&rsquo;s strength; the man would&rsquo;ve made a worthy Avenger if only he wasn&rsquo;t so eager to use brute force. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s about we end this?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\tSteve didn&rsquo;t bother to reply as his fingers twitched, aching to remove the oppressive hand. His vision was darkening, a black fuzz consuming his world. Water forced itself into his mouth, down into his lungs. A tight burn in his throat chest contrasted the chill of the blue void around him.<br/></p><p>\tRoss shook him. &quot;Don&rsquo;t die on me, Steve!&rdquo; His grip on Steve&rsquo;s neck tightened&mdash;and then loosened.<br/></p><p>\tSteve didn&rsquo;t have the energy to wonder why. The black fuzz was now invading his mind, peaceful and comforting and urging him to just <i>let go, you&rsquo;ve lived long enough, Peggy is waiting, you&rsquo;ve got a date</i>. Yes, he&rsquo;s given his all to this era, hasn&rsquo;t he? He built up the Avengers, stopped an alien invasion, and found and liberated his friend. What more could the world, could SHIELD, want from him?<br/></p><p><i>\tThe Avengers will survive. They will take care of everyone.</i><i><br/></i></p><p><i>\tLet go, Steve.</i><br/></p><p>\tBlue filled his vision again, unusually bright. Although Steve&rsquo;s vision was blurred with pain&mdash;head injury, he had to remain awake&mdash;he saw that a face was before him. It wasn&rsquo;t Ross; no, a dark-haired man stared at him, a sharp-toothed but relieved smile on his face.<br/></p><p>\tSteve couldn&rsquo;t tear his gaze from the merman&rsquo;s eyes. His irises and pupils were glowing the same blue that shined out from his strange metal suit. The werewolf was transfixed.<br/></p><p>\tToo soon a smooth, featureless mask slid down over the merman&rsquo;s face. He turned to the left and, his voice hosting a mechanical undertone, clicked and whistled at a companion.<br/></p><p>\tIn a similar mechanical suit&mdash;this one black and silver and glowing orange&mdash;was his friend. Whether it was a machine or a merperson in a metal shell, they easily and repeatedly overpowered Ross. The GAIA agent snarled and swiped but he knew he was outmatched. When the orange merman glanced at Blue, he swung in place and bolted away.<br/></p><p>\tSteve really wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Ross was the type to swear revenge.<br/></p><p>\tBlue and orange, gray and black, filled his vision. Unnaturally smooth fingers and arms wrapped themselves around the joint connecting his arms to his shoulders and hoisted him up with a gentleness he only recieved from Natasha.<br/></p><p>\tAbove him was the moon, its form wavering erratically. Werewolves and the Moon, people thought the two had a connection. Dr. Erskine never mentioned the effects the moon had on werewolves or even human-turned-werewolves, and Steve never felt any more powerful under a full moon than he did under a crescent moon. But he prayed anyway, begging whatever&mdash;if anything&mdash;possessed the moon to heal the concussion he knew he&rsquo;d have, that it wouldn&rsquo;t last too long, that he&rsquo;d get to go back to the surface, that Natasha and the others search for him.<br/></p><p>_____________________________________________</p><p><br/>Tony knew his father hated humans. Something about a human male chasing him when he was a pup. So when&mdash;and it <i>is</i> a when, because Father had his ways of worming secrets from their holders&mdash;Tony&rsquo;s big Star was found&hellip;well, the young Princes will ensure he gets sent to the wealthiest quadrant in the human community.<br/></p><p>\tFor the sixth time in their hold, Star went limp. A concussion. Tony knew what those were like, to fall unconscious again and again, to sometimes forget what happened, to have the life sucked out of you at the mere flick of a tail&mdash;or leg, in Star&rsquo;s case. All he and Arno could do was swim as fast as they can to Strange&rsquo;s Sanctum and keep him as still as possible in their arms.<br/></p><p>\t&ldquo;He&rsquo;s different, this Star of yours,&rdquo; Arno warbled.<br/></p><p>\tTony nodded. Even in the water, humans had a particular scent to them. But Star&rsquo;s taste was warped, human but not-human. &ldquo;So how deep do we need to bury this secret?&rdquo; Because if Father found Star he&rsquo;ll know immediately that Star is in some way special, and he&rsquo;ll have him tested. And if there was anything Father loved more than his own sons, it was prestige and the admiration (cough<i>jealousy</i>cough) that came with it.<br/></p><p>\t&ldquo;Pretend-he-doesn&rsquo;t-exist deep.&rdquo; Arno led them in a dive though a cavern filled with shrimp and spiders.<br/></p><p>\t&ldquo;Ah, my weakness.&rdquo; But Tony heard the implication in his brother&rsquo;s words: <i>We should&rsquo;ve stayed home.</i> But that only hardened Tony&rsquo;s resolve to help and protect the not-human. There was something about him that lured Tony to him, something that Tony knew would be worth the hell Father will eventually put him through. As they emerged into the depths again, Tony spared Star a glance. His head was up, turning left and right as they passed swarms of bioluminescent jellyfish, but his movements were sluggish.<br/></p><p>In the distance were the upper shelves of the Subduon, the trench Eingara was built in: the shelves of the poor, of the merchants and traders and artisans, and of the Upper Military. Piercing through the encompassing darkness were the lights, glittering and flashing red, blue, green, and yellow. The Sanctum was more attuned to the wealthy while still remaining quite a swim away; it was located right at the bottom of the trench.<br/></p><p>\t&ldquo;There&rsquo;re going to be a lot of curious fish,&rdquo; warned the elder of the brothers, angling them toward the bright lights. His gray face plate lifted, revealing a thoughtful frown. &ldquo;Star still needs time to acclimate. If we take him down there, we&rsquo;ll have another flounder.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>\tTony nodded, lifting his own face plate. When they were young there was news of a Merrow who&rsquo;d saved a human and brought them down to the depths. But even with the newfound abilities to breathe underwater and survive its bone-reaching chill, the human still had yet to adapt to the crushing depths. By the time the Merrow reached bottom of the trench, the human &ldquo;looked more like a flounder.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>\tAnd Tony did <i>not</i> want to be the traumatized owner of a flounder.<br/></p><p>\tThere was a human community up on the shelf, high enough that Star would not succumb to the pressure. For now, they were Star&rsquo;s best chance at survival.<br/>\tAs if they were sharks on the prowl the civilians cleared the way for their princes as they swept through the city, their eyes lingering on the limp not-human in their grasp. They hummed and clicked theories to one another but none were arrogant enough to intercept them. Tony prayed that they couldn&rsquo;t catch Star&rsquo;s scent in the water, prayed that a noble adorned with peridot, gold, and/or a rainbow of pearls wouldn&rsquo;t be in the crowd.<br/></p><p>\tThe human living area was a time capsule, a timeline of trends that dominated the stonemasonry field mixed with the myriad of surface cultures. The first humans, chosen survivors from shipwrecks throughout the centuries, were dumped in towns of jagged and shoddy stonework. Generations passed, and new divisions were added, the stonework displaying floral and animal reliefs as well as strange geometric depictions.<br/></p><p>\tDisplaying a mixture of whale and dolphin reliefs and curving lines was the hospital, one of the largest buildings in western division. Like the Merrow civilians, the humans threw themselves out the way of the royals, signing to one another and pointing to Star.<br/></p><p>\tClusters of pillar coral lights bathed the inside of the reception area with kelp yellows and sky blues. The receptionist, an elderly woman, lifted her head as the princes swam up to her. Seeing that their load was limp, her eyes widened and she thrust herself from the desk. The woman pointed to a white-lit hallway on her right and swam off.<br/></p><p>\tTony and Arno followed.<br/></p><p>\tThe room the receptionist led them to was lit with a golden coral light that was growing downwards from the ceiling. The stony floor was carpeted with sea grass and the walls swayed with vibrant anemones and soft corals. To the left of the doorway was\u00a0a wall-long counter, all its contents sorted into neat groups. In the middle of the room was a mechanical bed fashioned into a mussel shell, fitted with sealskin sheets. The princes lay Star down on the sheets, settling him on his belly.<br/></p><p>\tStar blinked open his eyes. Those little windows to the sky searched the room before fixating on Tony. Confusion was written all over his youthful face.<br/></p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safe here, I promise,&rdquo; Tony assured.<br/></p>",

His name was Ross Sweinden, Steve remembered, one of GAIA\u2019s packs of muscle. They had met before, only a week ago, when Ross had nearly bested him in combat. Steve was impressed, he respected Ross\u2019s strength; the man would\u2019ve made a worthy Avenger if only he wasn\u2019t so eager to use brute force. \u201cHow\u2019s about we end this?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\tSteve didn\u2019t bother to reply as his fingers twitched, aching to remove the oppressive hand. His vision was darkening, a black fuzz consuming his world. Water forced itself into his mouth, down into his lungs. A tight burn in his throat chest contrasted the chill of the blue void around him.<br></p><p>\tRoss shook him. \"Don\u2019t die on me, Steve!\u201d His grip on Steve\u2019s neck tightened\u2014and then loosened.<br></p><p>\tSteve didn\u2019t have the energy to wonder why. The black fuzz was now invading his mind, peaceful and comforting and urging him to just <i>let go, you\u2019ve lived long enough, Peggy is waiting, you\u2019ve got a date</i>. Yes, he\u2019s given his all to this era, hasn\u2019t he? He built up the Avengers, stopped an alien invasion, and found and liberated his friend. What more could the world, could SHIELD, want from him?<br></p><p><i>\tThe Avengers will survive. They will take care of everyone.</i><i><br></i></p><p><i>\tLet go, Steve.</i><br></p><p>\tBlue filled his vision again, unusually bright. Although Steve\u2019s vision was blurred with pain\u2014head injury, he had to remain awake\u2014he saw that a face was before him. It wasn\u2019t Ross; no, a dark-haired man stared at him, a sharp-toothed but relieved smile on his face.<br></p><p>\tSteve couldn\u2019t tear his gaze from the merman\u2019s eyes. His irises and pupils were glowing the same blue that shined out from his strange metal suit. The werewolf was transfixed.<br></p><p>\tToo soon a smooth, featureless mask slid down over the merman\u2019s face. He turned to the left and, his voice hosting a mechanical undertone, clicked and whistled at a companion.<br></p><p>\tIn a similar mechanical suit\u2014this one black and silver and glowing orange\u2014was his friend. Whether it was a machine or a merperson in a metal shell, they easily and repeatedly overpowered Ross. The GAIA agent snarled and swiped but he knew he was outmatched. When the orange merman glanced at Blue, he swung in place and bolted away.<br></p><p>\tSteve really wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Ross was the type to swear revenge.<br></p><p>\tBlue and orange, gray and black, filled his vision. Unnaturally smooth fingers and arms wrapped themselves around the joint connecting his arms to his shoulders and hoisted him up with a gentleness he only recieved from Natasha.<br></p><p>\tAbove him was the moon, its form wavering erratically. Werewolves and the Moon, people thought the two had a connection. Dr. Erskine never mentioned the effects the moon had on werewolves or even human-turned-werewolves, and Steve never felt any more powerful under a full moon than he did under a crescent moon. But he prayed anyway, begging whatever\u2014if anything\u2014possessed the moon to heal the concussion he knew he\u2019d have, that it wouldn\u2019t last too long, that he\u2019d get to go back to the surface, that Natasha and the others search for him.<br></p><p>_____________________________________________</p><p><br>Tony knew his father hated humans. Something about a human male chasing him when he was a pup. So when\u2014and it <i>is</i> a when, because Father had his ways of worming secrets from their holders\u2014Tony\u2019s big Star was found\u2026well, the young Princes will ensure he gets sent to the wealthiest quadrant in the human community.<br></p><p>\tFor the sixth time in their hold, Star went limp. A concussion. Tony knew what those were like, to fall unconscious again and again, to sometimes forget what happened, to have the life sucked out of you at the mere flick of a tail\u2014or leg, in Star\u2019s case. All he and Arno could do was swim as fast as they can to Strange\u2019s Sanctum and keep him as still as possible in their arms.<br></p><p>\t\u201cHe\u2019s different, this Star of yours,\u201d Arno warbled.<br></p><p>\tTony nodded. Even in the water, humans had a particular scent to them. But Star\u2019s taste was warped, human but not-human. \u201cSo how deep do we need to bury this secret?\u201d Because if Father found Star he\u2019ll know immediately that Star is in some way special, and he\u2019ll have him tested. And if there was anything Father loved more than his own sons, it was prestige and the admiration (cough<i>jealousy</i>cough) that came with it.<br></p><p>\t\u201cPretend-he-doesn\u2019t-exist deep.\u201d Arno led them in a dive though a cavern filled with shrimp and spiders.<br></p><p>\t\u201cAh, my weakness.\u201d But Tony heard the implication in his brother\u2019s words: <i>We should\u2019ve stayed home.</i> But that only hardened Tony\u2019s resolve to help and protect the not-human. There was something about him that lured Tony to him, something that Tony knew would be worth the hell Father will eventually put him through. As they emerged into the depths again, Tony spared Star a glance. His head was up, turning left and right as they passed swarms of bioluminescent jellyfish, but his movements were sluggish.<br></p><p>In the distance were the upper shelves of the Subduon, the trench Eingara was built in: the shelves of the poor, of the merchants and traders and artisans, and of the Upper Military. Piercing through the encompassing darkness were the lights, glittering and flashing red, blue, green, and yellow. The Sanctum was more attuned to the wealthy while still remaining quite a swim away; it was located right at the bottom of the trench.<br></p><p>\t\u201cThere\u2019re going to be a lot of curious fish,\u201d warned the elder of the brothers, angling them toward the bright lights. His gray face plate lifted, revealing a thoughtful frown. \u201cStar still needs time to acclimate. If we take him down there, we\u2019ll have another flounder.\u201d<br></p><p>\tTony nodded, lifting his own face plate. When they were young there was news of a Merrow who\u2019d saved a human and brought them down to the depths. But even with the newfound abilities to breathe underwater and survive its bone-reaching chill, the human still had yet to adapt to the crushing depths. By the time the Merrow reached bottom of the trench, the human \u201clooked more like a flounder.\u201d<br></p><p>\tAnd Tony did <i>not</i> want to be the traumatized owner of a flounder.<br></p><p>\tThere was a human community up on the shelf, high enough that Star would not succumb to the pressure. For now, they were Star\u2019s best chance at survival.<br>\tAs if they were sharks on the prowl the civilians cleared the way for their princes as they swept through the city, their eyes lingering on the limp not-human in their grasp. They hummed and clicked theories to one another but none were arrogant enough to intercept them. Tony prayed that they couldn\u2019t catch Star\u2019s scent in the water, prayed that a noble adorned with peridot, gold, and/or a rainbow of pearls wouldn\u2019t be in the crowd.<br></p><p>\tThe human living area was a time capsule, a timeline of trends that dominated the stonemasonry field mixed with the myriad of surface cultures. The first humans, chosen survivors from shipwrecks throughout the centuries, were dumped in towns of jagged and shoddy stonework. Generations passed, and new divisions were added, the stonework displaying floral and animal reliefs as well as strange geometric depictions.<br></p><p>\tDisplaying a mixture of whale and dolphin reliefs and curving lines was the hospital, one of the largest buildings in western division. Like the Merrow civilians, the humans threw themselves out the way of the royals, signing to one another and pointing to Star.<br></p><p>\tClusters of pillar coral lights bathed the inside of the reception area with kelp yellows and sky blues. The receptionist, an elderly woman, lifted her head as the princes swam up to her. Seeing that their load was limp, her eyes widened and she thrust herself from the desk. The woman pointed to a white-lit hallway on her right and swam off.<br></p><p>\tTony and Arno followed.<br></p><p>\tThe room the receptionist led them to was lit with a golden coral light that was growing downwards from the ceiling. The stony floor was carpeted with sea grass and the walls swayed with vibrant anemones and soft corals. To the left of the doorway was\u00a0a wall-long counter, all its contents sorted into neat groups. In the middle of the room was a mechanical bed fashioned into a mussel shell, fitted with sealskin sheets. The princes lay Star down on the sheets, settling him on his belly.<br></p><p>\tStar blinked open his eyes. Those little windows to the sky searched the room before fixating on Tony. Confusion was written all over his youthful face.<br></p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here, I promise,\u201d Tony assured.<br></p>",
