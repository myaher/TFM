        "body": "<p><i>So, let me say this, this is from an RP my bestie and I was doing. I wrote this on Google Docs and figured, why not post it! It\u2019s not my best work and honestly, it\u2019s my first time writing something for the My Hero Academia fandom. I\u2019m fairly new to the fandom and this just popped into my head last night. I want to apologize for Shigaraki being OOC at all. The RP is not reader insert, she\u2019s my own OC. Long story short, her name is Kohana Mori. She\u2019s a villain in this one. She has white hair and blue eyes, pale skin, and is fairly thin. The RP for this one hasn\u2019t gone very far so not sure about much with her. Either way, please enjoy some deliciously pointless Tomura Shigaraki smut. Because he is one of my babies and needs more love. Side note: Her name translates to Little Flower Forest.</i></p><p><i>This is rated M. Features smut, cussing, and possible triggers. 18+ readers would be best but honestly, I can\u2019t exactly stop you. You have been warned. Also, possible dub-con because let\u2019s be honest, the teasing and threats get bad.</i></p><p><b>-</b></p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Shigaraki sounded furious as Hana came walking in the door of the bar fresh from a workout.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cWalking through the bar. Why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d He motioned to her body. At this moment the entire League was looking at the two of them. Mind you there were only Toga, Dabi, Kurogiri, herself, and Tomura in there currently so not many but still.</p><p>\u201cWearing what, Shigaraki?\u201d she asked unsure of what his problem was. The last few weeks he had been a particularly extra mean asshole to her. Also to Dabi, but mainly her.</p><p>\u201cThat!\u201d he motioned towards the All Might themed sports bra she was currently wearing complete with matching capris.</p><p>\u201cI received it as a gift from my best friend. And I happen to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the League of Villains. We are literally trying to kill the Hero you happen to be wearing.\u201d His hands itched at his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware but the set is cute!\u201d she protested. \u201cAnd it was a present. I\u2019m not gonna ignore a nice gift from a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a single shit. Take it off and dispose of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d Why the hell did he feel the need to be this big of an asshole?</p><p>\u201cTake it off!\u201d His impatience was just increasing. How dare she walk into his bar wearing that trash? It didn\u2019t help she was sweating and her hair was pulled up.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Once more?\u201d An idea formed in her mind.</p><p>\u201cTAKE IT OFF BEFORE I WRAP MY HANDS AROUND YOUR FUCKING NECK!\u201d She knew he meant it too. He was shaking in anger, Kurogiri keeping him held back. </p><p>\u201cTake it off?\u201d she gave him an incredulous look before sighing. \u201cOkay then. You asked for it. You win. I\u2019ll take it off.\u201d She got a big ass shit eating grin on her face. She looked around to every single one of the villains sitting in the bar and grabbed the edges of the capris. She yanked them down and stepped out revealing her black lace thong. There were a couple gasps and Shigaraki looked completely stunned. No one moved. She reached under the edges of the sports bra and yanked that over her head. She smirked at everyone in the bar. Her eyes went from Shigaraki to Toga and finally landed on Dabi who was ready to spit his drink. She bent over and picked up her fallen clothes. \u201cThere. They\u2019re off.\u201d She stood there completely bare except for the panties. And her socks.</p><p>Shigaraki wanted to yell but he was way too distracted. She threw the clothes over her shoulder and walked her petite little ass to the back where she could change and shower. </p><p>Thank goodness her dad hadn\u2019t been there to see this.</p><p>Shigaraki was silent and didn\u2019t move for a solid fifteen seconds before he shoved Kurogiri aside and stomped after Hana. Everyone else stayed in the bar trying to process what just happened. She was almost to the full bathroom with her bag of clothes, still naked, when Shigaraki stepped in-between her and the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something Shigaraki?\u201d She thrust her chest forward a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d he was just barely keeping his eyes from scanning over her body. No one had ever shocked him like that, except maybe Izuku Midoriya, and certainly never stripped naked in his bar.</p><p>\u201cYou yelled at me to take off my workout clothes. So I did. I only did what you wanted.\u201d she said with an innocent tone to her voice that he knew was fake as she stood on her tiptoes to bat her eyes at him. He looked furious. The itching at his neck increased as she noticed him looking down.</p><p>\u201cYou stripped naked in front of the whole bar you little slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, you\u2019re the only one who seemed to have a problem with it. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I just worked out, I\u2019m sweaty, and I need a shower.\u201d She reached up and let her long white hair fall from its messy bun and down her back. \u201cSo, unless you\u2019re gonna join me, get out of my way, please.\u201d He continued to block her. In retaliation, she stripped off her last remaining clothing items. Her socks went first tossing them over her shoulder. Then, she locked eyes with him as she shucked her panties down and kicked them off her ankles never once breaking eye contact.</p><p>He finally moved aside and let her pass him. He broke eye contact first as she walked past him and he stared at her ass. She knew exactly what she was doing as she bent over to turn on the water, leaving her clothes on the sink. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna close the door?\u201d she said looking back to him. He shut the door alright. When she turned around again he had shut the door and she heard the lock click. However, he was now not wearing a shirt. The hand he called \u2018Father\u2019 was sitting on top of his shirt on the counter. She never realized how skinny he actually was. His arms looked nice though even with the previous scars and bullet holes. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said to join you,\u201d he said and tugged at the drawstring of his pants. She turned around, her face heating up, and adjusted the water to boiling hot like she liked. She figured he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the heat. She pushed the curtain back completely and stepped in. \u201cSo, I\u2019m gonna join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I hope you like showers so hot they could melt skin.\u201d she was testing him now. There was no way he would actually do this. She looked back at him with a sarcastic toss of her long hair. This was a game of chicken and she was gonna win.</p><p>\u201cLast I checked I\u2019m the only thing in the League that can destroy skin so thoroughly.\u201d She felt his presence close to her back but she didn\u2019t turn around. She switched the water to shower and let it come down around them. If his clothes got wet then so what? If there was one thing she could say for this shitty bar in this shitty area, it had an amazing shower, thankfully kept clean by Kurogiri she assumed, and the water pressure was fantastic. She turned around looking him in the eye. She wasn\u2019t gonna look down. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to. She often forgot he was several inches taller than her. She was short as it was. He made her feel so small but her actions today had made her feel taller than him even if she did have to expose herself to half the League to do it. </p><p>\u201cHave you met Dabi? Such big talk,\u201d she said stepping completely into the stream. The steam from the showered filled the bathroom and she stared him in the eye daring him to try something. She decided to tease him a little. She turned around facing the shower and felt the steamy, hot water run through her sweaty scalp. She let out a moan as the water ran down her back and through her scalp. What could she say, it felt good. She raised her arms and let the water cover all of her skin washing the sweat and grime she felt. She let out a couple more soft moans. She turned and his crimson eyes were burning a hole in the back of her head. The steam had raised a flush to his skin. Yeah, it was the steam. She stepped aside to let him pass. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna get wet?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He stepped past her to step in the water stream. She smirked as she went for the lavender scented shampoo she had brought with her. She poured some into her hand and grinned her shit eating grin. Okay then. She reached up and put her shampoo in his hair. He flinched and turned around with a fast twist. </p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you doing?\u201d He looked annoyed but she simply stood on her tiptoes and continued.</p><p>\u201cJust thought you could use a little help. Hope you like lavender. Now, come here.\u201d she said cheerfully. He looked even more annoyed but reluctantly leaned down to let her finish. She got a thorough lather worked into his hair and she felt the tips of his fingers run over her arm. She let him. He kept his pinky off her so she wouldn\u2019t decay in the shower. She didn\u2019t let him know how nice it felt to be touched. It had been a while since she\u2019d had someone touch her. \u201cRinse.\u201d she turned away to pick the bottle back up and pour more into her hand. She lathered it into her own hair until she was covered in soap. She turned around with her eyes closed. She felt a hand on her wrist and he gently pulled her into the stream of water. She reached up to scrub her scalp until she was sure the soap was gone. When she opened them she was staring straight into Shigaraki\u2019s red eyes inches from her. </p><p>Her breathing hitched and his fingers ran over her arm again. She looked down and watched them. His touch actually felt nice. Even with it being so lethal. She looked back up to him with a smile. She reached one hand up and ran her thumb over the scar on his lips. He closed his eyes as she ran her fingers across his cheek, his eyelids, and into his hair. He seemed to relax into her touch. She smiled as she pressed against him. She felt something against her leg and knew what it was. She left a kiss on his cheek. </p><p>\u201cTo-mu-ra~\u201d she pressed tighter against him crushing him against the wall and her body. She left little kisses on his cheeks not once touching his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Haven\u2019t you ever been touched before?\u201d Her hands slipped around his neck gently sliding over the scarred skin of his own doing. She actually looked sad for a moment. She knew what it was like to be anxious and only have toxic outlets. She also knew just how touch starved this man was. His quirk wouldn\u2019t really allow for safe touch. Good thing she didn\u2019t fear death. She stood as tall as she could and left kisses on the skin of his neck. She tilted his chin upwards so she could reach easier. She felt him press closer to the wall as though he was afraid of her touch. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I promise I\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being nice,\u201d he stated. \u201cAfter what you pulled in the bar. After I yelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be mean if you want. Maybe I should punish you for yelling at me.\u201d She pressed tighter and bit gently into his neck. He gasped and felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe but she heard him groan over the sounds of the water running. She held his neck pulling him closer to her level. She bit down a little harder making sure to leave a mark. \u201cMaybe I should make you apologize for yelling at me and making me do that in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a better chance of killing All Might by yourself.\u201d He was pushing her. She was gonna push back. </p><p>\u201cFine then.\u201d she pulled away from him and stepped back into the stream of water. She bent over and reached for her body wash, also lavender scented, and poured some on an exfoliating cloth she brought with her. She ran it over her skin not once meeting his angry eyes. She went as far as to crank the water up a little hotter. He stepped out of the stream and she felt him watching her. She scrubbed her skin, making sure to do extra bending and twirling her hair. She smiled an evil little smile and turned around. \u201cWill you get my back? I\u2019ll do yours after if you like.\u201d she held out the cloth to him fully expecting him to ignore her or even get out. He surprised her by pulling her close to him and taking the cloth from her hands. She turned around and stepped back towards him. She reached up and moved her wet hair so her bare back was fully exposed to him. </p><p>She felt the cloth run over her shoulders. She didn\u2019t think he would really do it. Yet, here she was taking a shower with Tomura Shigaraki and he was currently running an exfoliating cloth down her shoulders, her spine, and down as close to her ass as he could get without actually touching it. She was about to step back under the water until she felt his lips against her neck avoiding the soap on her back. One of his arms circled her waist, his hand balled in a fist so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally touch her. He pulled her flush against him not letting her move. Two could play this game. </p><p>Hana pressed further until he was back to being sandwiched against her and the wall. She felt his erection pressing against her ass and she slowly, torturously, moved her hips against him. She heard him gasp, felt his breathing hitch, and his other arm wrapped across her chest. She leaned her head back against his shoulder and he left new kisses and bites on her neck. She continued to move against him slowly not giving him near enough friction to finish but just enough to torture him.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep teasing me you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d he threatened. She could hear the tone of his voice. She pushed. One of her hands slipped between them and she palmed his erection. Holy crap, this dude was not small. She wasn\u2019t expecting that. She had heard Dabi making jokes about him having a small dick. She could say with certainty he was definitely wrong. For the first time since pissing him off, she was genuinely afraid he would hurt her, just not with his lethal quirk. \u201cKohana\u2026 Don\u2019t make me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you what? Apologize to me?\u201d she let out a gasp as he bit harder into her neck. She palmed him a little harder and ran her hand down his length. Her fingers brushing over the head. She ran her thumb over his slit playing with the pre-cum that leaked from him. \u201cWhat would you really do to me, huh, Tomura?\u201d She didn\u2019t let on to how good this all felt. She had been feeling the wetness building between her legs and the heat pooling in her lower stomach. It all felt so good. He bit her harder damn near drawing blood.</p><p>\u201cKeep pushing me and I\u2019ll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what? Since you won\u2019t apologize to me, what will you do?\u201d She looked back at him with her big blue eyes staring into his crimson red eyes. The steam in the room was nearly unbearable and thick. One hand stayed on his length giving languid strokes and the other hand was digging nails into one of his arms. He dropped his arms letting her free. She stepped into the water to rinse her back and turned to see him mere inches from her face. She grinned up at him and batted her eyes. \u201cTo-mu-ra~\u201d she moved closer to him. \u201cWhat will you do to me?\u201d </p><p>He closed the gap between them and kissed her hard. If she had to guess due to the sloppy way he kissed her that this was his first kiss. It had to be. He wasn\u2019t the type to have a high school sweetheart that gave him his first go. She wrapped her arms around his neck. He kept one finger on each hand off her as he gripped her waist hard enough to bruise and slammed her against the heated tile. One hand kept her pinned while the other slid down her bare chest running smoothly over her nipple and over her breast. She shivered against him and moaned into his mouth. Her lips parted for air and he slipped his tongue past her lips. His knee slid in between her legs and pressed so close to her she was able to grind down on his knee as she was desperate for friction at this point. She moaned loudly as he attached himself to her neck again. Her fingers slid over his shoulders and down his back.</p><p>\u201cTomura&hellip;please\u2026\u201d she moaned again feeling him push harder against her. She hated the fact she was reduced to begging. It all felt too good. They both smelled like lavender, the steam kept their faces flushed, his blue hair and her white hair were soaked and stuck to them. \u201cTell me what you want to do to me. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to break you. I want to bend you over this shower and fuck you until you\u2019re crying and begging for me to let you come. You were bad today. Taking your clothes off in front of the League. What am I gonna do with you? Should I even fuck you or should I get out now and leave you by yourself?\u201d the words came out as she reached down to stroke him again. She grinned. \u201cWipe that look off your face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d she asked looking into his eyes and running a hand in his pretty blue hair. She damn near shrieked as one of his fingers suddenly entered her. \u201cFuck!\u201d she cussed and he took the advantage to shove his mouth on hers again and fought with her own for dominance. She let him win. He kept his index finger inside her, his thumb on her clit teasing her, and the other three fingers to his palm so he didn\u2019t hurt her. He pumped into her slowly. He watched her eyes rolling in her head and she moaned loudly against him. He added a second finger and felt her natural juices flowing down his hand. </p><p>\u201cAre you really so wet for me? Does the idea of me nearly killing you really turn you on?\u201d he asked feeling her stroke him harder with little twists and jerks of her wrist. She kissed him on the lips and pressed a kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWould you really hurt me? I think you like me too much.\u201d she grinned and her face fell as he hit a specific spot inside her that had her clenching around his fingers. He swiftly removed his hand and forced her legs open more. He leaned down and slipped an arm under one of her knees. He lifted her leg exposing her most intimate areas to him completely. He lined himself up with her entrance.</p><p>\u201cBeg for me.\u201d he rubbed the tip of his cock against her slit but never going in. She actually looked down and paled a little. This was gonna hurt. The combination of his size and her not having been with anyone in the past year made her want to rethink this but at this point, she was sure neither of them actually could.</p><p>\u201cPlease Tomura, fuck me. I want you.\u201d she gripped his face in her hands and pulled him into another kiss. She exclaimed into the kiss as he sheathed himself inside her in one swift motion. \u201cFucking hell\u2026 Ow\u2026 Fuck\u2026 It hurts\u2026\u201d he didn&rsquo;t move, allowing her to adjust to the size of him. \u201cShit!\u201d she cussed. He slipped out slightly and slipped back in until he bottomed out. Her eyes scrunched up from the pain. She looked into his eyes. He seemed genuinely worried. His hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding her leg reached up and his thumb wiped away the tear that had fallen down her cheek. </p><p>\u201cI told you I would break you for being such a bad girl today.\u201d He pulled out and slammed himself back in making her cry out. The mix of pain and pleasure sent his name tumbling from her mouth. After a few more thrusts there was no more pain. He paused for a second to lift her other leg. Her legs were wrapped around his hips and she was stuck to the wall. He pistoned himself into her as his mouth wandered down her neck, chest, and breasts. He left kisses, bites, and dark hickeys on every bit of skin he could reach. He fisted her hair in his hand when she tried to move her neck away. It was a miracle her hair didn\u2019t decay. She was a dripping, needy, fucked up mess against him and he kept going until he could feel himself coming close. He felt her clenching around him with each thrust and knew she wouldn\u2019t last long either. \u201cYou take my cock so well. Aren\u2019t you a good girl for me? Can you cum for me? You will come for me. Cum on my cock like a good girl.\u201d he thrust into her harder and one of his hands drifted down to play with her clit. Her screams only got louder as he continued to fuck her into the wall and stroke her clit roughly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tomura! You feel so good. Please don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m so close! I promise I\u2019ll come for you. I\u2019m so\u2026\u201d she trailed off and screamed as she tumbled over the edge. She may have screamed a little too loudly because a sudden crashed nearly ruined the mood. He ignored it and kept going as his own end approached. A few thrusts later and he bottomed out cumming deep inside her with a growl and a shout of her name. They stayed in place, him still inside her as he finished releasing within her, her legs locked around him, and looked each other in the eyes. Red met blue. She gently stroked his cheek and he kissed her gently. Both of them stared with heaving chests trying to take deep breaths. The steam made it hard. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out,\u201d he spoke finally. She undid her legs from his hips and he turned the water off. She nearly fell and he kept her held up. Her legs felt like Jell-O and it hurt to walk. He felt somewhat bad for being so rough with her but it also made him a little smug. He stepped out and looked down to see what had happened. Her quirk had destroyed the bathroom mirror when she screamed. Most of it landed in the sink. There were a few shards on the floor. He didn\u2019t care. He reached for the towels that were hanging avoiding the glass. He passed one to her and she got out of the tub on sore, shaky legs. He wrapped a towel around his waist. Once she was covered he grabbed her and scooped her into his arms. His room was down the hall. He left their clothes sitting on the sink vowing to come back for them. She looked up at him with tired eyes. She hadn\u2019t expected this from him. This was very new. He was also much stronger than he looked since he seemed to have no trouble lifting and carrying her.</p><p>He opened the door to his room and set her gently on his bed. She dried off as he threw her an old T-shirt of his and he dressed in sweats and no shirt. He didn\u2019t give her any pants to wear so she figured she wasn\u2019t getting any underwear either. She wasn\u2019t bothered. After what had just transpired she was glad to have some coverage. The shirt hung off one shoulder and barely covered her ass.</p><p>He left the room for a few minutes to retrieve their clothes from the bathroom and inform Kurogiri that the mirror had been broken. Toga and Dabi were long gone. Kurogiri wished Shigaraki a good night as it was now late. Kurogiri did not ask what had happened to the mirror or where Hana was. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure it out based on what they\u2019d heard in the bathroom. Toga and Dabi had left the second they heard them talking in the hallway. He had a feeling they would give him shit for it later.</p><p>He went back into his room to see her lying on his bed, his shirt barely covered her ass, and the lack of underwear was a nice sight to see. She had already claimed a pillow. She was laying there waiting for him. She watched him move around the room with tired eyes. He wasn\u2019t going to admit this but it felt so weirdly pleasant knowing there was an extremely attractive girl, with no underwear on, wearing one of his shirts, waiting for him to join her in his bed. That was definitely an ego boost. He smiled at the thought of the possessive way he had her in his bed and how she was sitting there waiting for him. Why did this feel so good? He pulled on a pair of thick gloves so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally kill her during the night. </p><p>He slipped into bed next to her and she immediately cuddled up into his side. He froze as she snuggled into his side and made herself comfortable, even throwing a leg over his leg. She threw an arm across his chest and settled her fingers on his neck. She smelled so damn good. She rubbed the skin of his neck in a soothing way and he wasn\u2019t going to lie and say it didn\u2019t feel good.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Tomura.\u201d she left a kiss on his cheek. He didn\u2019t stop her and just looked at her for a moment. She had a smile on her face. He felt his heart beat harder in his chest. </p><p>\u201cGood night, flower girl.\u201d he forcefully kissed her lips and nuzzled his face in her lavender scented hair. She let him. He wrapped his arms around her as she drifted off first. He looked down at her knowing full well he was definitely gonna have a repeat of this tomorrow. Then, with a heavy sigh, sure that she was asleep, he muttered. \u201cSorry.\u201d He couldn\u2019t see her smirk in the dark.</p>",

            "comment": "<p><i>So, let me say this, this is from an RP my bestie and I was doing. I wrote this on Google Docs and figured, why not post it! It\u2019s not my best work and honestly, it\u2019s my first time writing something for the My Hero Academia fandom. I\u2019m fairly new to the fandom and this just popped into my head last night. I want to apologize for Shigaraki being OOC at all. The RP is not reader insert, she\u2019s my own OC. Long story short, her name is Kohana Mori. She\u2019s a villain in this one. She has white hair and blue eyes, pale skin, and is fairly thin. The RP for this one hasn\u2019t gone very far so not sure about much with her. Either way, please enjoy some deliciously pointless Tomura Shigaraki smut. Because he is one of my babies and needs more love. Side note: Her name translates to Little Flower Forest.</i></p><p><i>This is rated M. Features smut, cussing, and possible triggers. 18+ readers would be best but honestly, I can\u2019t exactly stop you. You have been warned. Also, possible dub-con because let\u2019s be honest, the teasing and threats get bad.</i></p><p><b>-</b></p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Shigaraki sounded furious as Hana came walking in the door of the bar fresh from a workout.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cWalking through the bar. Why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d He motioned to her body. At this moment the entire League was looking at the two of them. Mind you there were only Toga, Dabi, Kurogiri, herself, and Tomura in there currently so not many but still.</p><p>\u201cWearing what, Shigaraki?\u201d she asked unsure of what his problem was. The last few weeks he had been a particularly extra mean asshole to her. Also to Dabi, but mainly her.</p><p>\u201cThat!\u201d he motioned towards the All Might themed sports bra she was currently wearing complete with matching capris.</p><p>\u201cI received it as a gift from my best friend. And I happen to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the League of Villains. We are literally trying to kill the Hero you happen to be wearing.\u201d His hands itched at his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware but the set is cute!\u201d she protested. \u201cAnd it was a present. I\u2019m not gonna ignore a nice gift from a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a single shit. Take it off and dispose of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d Why the hell did he feel the need to be this big of an asshole?</p><p>\u201cTake it off!\u201d His impatience was just increasing. How dare she walk into his bar wearing that trash? It didn\u2019t help she was sweating and her hair was pulled up.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Once more?\u201d An idea formed in her mind.</p><p>\u201cTAKE IT OFF BEFORE I WRAP MY HANDS AROUND YOUR FUCKING NECK!\u201d She knew he meant it too. He was shaking in anger, Kurogiri keeping him held back. </p><p>\u201cTake it off?\u201d she gave him an incredulous look before sighing. \u201cOkay then. You asked for it. You win. I\u2019ll take it off.\u201d She got a big ass shit eating grin on her face. She looked around to every single one of the villains sitting in the bar and grabbed the edges of the capris. She yanked them down and stepped out revealing her black lace thong. There were a couple gasps and Shigaraki looked completely stunned. No one moved. She reached under the edges of the sports bra and yanked that over her head. She smirked at everyone in the bar. Her eyes went from Shigaraki to Toga and finally landed on Dabi who was ready to spit his drink. She bent over and picked up her fallen clothes. \u201cThere. They\u2019re off.\u201d She stood there completely bare except for the panties. And her socks.</p><p>Shigaraki wanted to yell but he was way too distracted. She threw the clothes over her shoulder and walked her petite little ass to the back where she could change and shower. </p><p>Thank goodness her dad hadn\u2019t been there to see this.</p><p>Shigaraki was silent and didn\u2019t move for a solid fifteen seconds before he shoved Kurogiri aside and stomped after Hana. Everyone else stayed in the bar trying to process what just happened. She was almost to the full bathroom with her bag of clothes, still naked, when Shigaraki stepped in-between her and the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something Shigaraki?\u201d She thrust her chest forward a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d he was just barely keeping his eyes from scanning over her body. No one had ever shocked him like that, except maybe Izuku Midoriya, and certainly never stripped naked in his bar.</p><p>\u201cYou yelled at me to take off my workout clothes. So I did. I only did what you wanted.\u201d she said with an innocent tone to her voice that he knew was fake as she stood on her tiptoes to bat her eyes at him. He looked furious. The itching at his neck increased as she noticed him looking down.</p><p>\u201cYou stripped naked in front of the whole bar you little slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, you\u2019re the only one who seemed to have a problem with it. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I just worked out, I\u2019m sweaty, and I need a shower.\u201d She reached up and let her long white hair fall from its messy bun and down her back. \u201cSo, unless you\u2019re gonna join me, get out of my way, please.\u201d He continued to block her. In retaliation, she stripped off her last remaining clothing items. Her socks went first tossing them over her shoulder. Then, she locked eyes with him as she shucked her panties down and kicked them off her ankles never once breaking eye contact.</p><p>He finally moved aside and let her pass him. He broke eye contact first as she walked past him and he stared at her ass. She knew exactly what she was doing as she bent over to turn on the water, leaving her clothes on the sink. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna close the door?\u201d she said looking back to him. He shut the door alright. When she turned around again he had shut the door and she heard the lock click. However, he was now not wearing a shirt. The hand he called \u2018Father\u2019 was sitting on top of his shirt on the counter. She never realized how skinny he actually was. His arms looked nice though even with the previous scars and bullet holes. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said to join you,\u201d he said and tugged at the drawstring of his pants. She turned around, her face heating up, and adjusted the water to boiling hot like she liked. She figured he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the heat. She pushed the curtain back completely and stepped in. \u201cSo, I\u2019m gonna join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I hope you like showers so hot they could melt skin.\u201d she was testing him now. There was no way he would actually do this. She looked back at him with a sarcastic toss of her long hair. This was a game of chicken and she was gonna win.</p><p>\u201cLast I checked I\u2019m the only thing in the League that can destroy skin so thoroughly.\u201d She felt his presence close to her back but she didn\u2019t turn around. She switched the water to shower and let it come down around them. If his clothes got wet then so what? If there was one thing she could say for this shitty bar in this shitty area, it had an amazing shower, thankfully kept clean by Kurogiri she assumed, and the water pressure was fantastic. She turned around looking him in the eye. She wasn\u2019t gonna look down. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to. She often forgot he was several inches taller than her. She was short as it was. He made her feel so small but her actions today had made her feel taller than him even if she did have to expose herself to half the League to do it. </p><p>\u201cHave you met Dabi? Such big talk,\u201d she said stepping completely into the stream. The steam from the showered filled the bathroom and she stared him in the eye daring him to try something. She decided to tease him a little. She turned around facing the shower and felt the steamy, hot water run through her sweaty scalp. She let out a moan as the water ran down her back and through her scalp. What could she say, it felt good. She raised her arms and let the water cover all of her skin washing the sweat and grime she felt. She let out a couple more soft moans. She turned and his crimson eyes were burning a hole in the back of her head. The steam had raised a flush to his skin. Yeah, it was the steam. She stepped aside to let him pass. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna get wet?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He stepped past her to step in the water stream. She smirked as she went for the lavender scented shampoo she had brought with her. She poured some into her hand and grinned her shit eating grin. Okay then. She reached up and put her shampoo in his hair. He flinched and turned around with a fast twist. </p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you doing?\u201d He looked annoyed but she simply stood on her tiptoes and continued.</p><p>\u201cJust thought you could use a little help. Hope you like lavender. Now, come here.\u201d she said cheerfully. He looked even more annoyed but reluctantly leaned down to let her finish. She got a thorough lather worked into his hair and she felt the tips of his fingers run over her arm. She let him. He kept his pinky off her so she wouldn\u2019t decay in the shower. She didn\u2019t let him know how nice it felt to be touched. It had been a while since she\u2019d had someone touch her. \u201cRinse.\u201d she turned away to pick the bottle back up and pour more into her hand. She lathered it into her own hair until she was covered in soap. She turned around with her eyes closed. She felt a hand on her wrist and he gently pulled her into the stream of water. She reached up to scrub her scalp until she was sure the soap was gone. When she opened them she was staring straight into Shigaraki\u2019s red eyes inches from her. </p><p>Her breathing hitched and his fingers ran over her arm again. She looked down and watched them. His touch actually felt nice. Even with it being so lethal. She looked back up to him with a smile. She reached one hand up and ran her thumb over the scar on his lips. He closed his eyes as she ran her fingers across his cheek, his eyelids, and into his hair. He seemed to relax into her touch. She smiled as she pressed against him. She felt something against her leg and knew what it was. She left a kiss on his cheek. </p><p>\u201cTo-mu-ra~\u201d she pressed tighter against him crushing him against the wall and her body. She left little kisses on his cheeks not once touching his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Haven\u2019t you ever been touched before?\u201d Her hands slipped around his neck gently sliding over the scarred skin of his own doing. She actually looked sad for a moment. She knew what it was like to be anxious and only have toxic outlets. She also knew just how touch starved this man was. His quirk wouldn\u2019t really allow for safe touch. Good thing she didn\u2019t fear death. She stood as tall as she could and left kisses on the skin of his neck. She tilted his chin upwards so she could reach easier. She felt him press closer to the wall as though he was afraid of her touch. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I promise I\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being nice,\u201d he stated. \u201cAfter what you pulled in the bar. After I yelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be mean if you want. Maybe I should punish you for yelling at me.\u201d She pressed tighter and bit gently into his neck. He gasped and felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe but she heard him groan over the sounds of the water running. She held his neck pulling him closer to her level. She bit down a little harder making sure to leave a mark. \u201cMaybe I should make you apologize for yelling at me and making me do that in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a better chance of killing All Might by yourself.\u201d He was pushing her. She was gonna push back. </p><p>\u201cFine then.\u201d she pulled away from him and stepped back into the stream of water. She bent over and reached for her body wash, also lavender scented, and poured some on an exfoliating cloth she brought with her. She ran it over her skin not once meeting his angry eyes. She went as far as to crank the water up a little hotter. He stepped out of the stream and she felt him watching her. She scrubbed her skin, making sure to do extra bending and twirling her hair. She smiled an evil little smile and turned around. \u201cWill you get my back? I\u2019ll do yours after if you like.\u201d she held out the cloth to him fully expecting him to ignore her or even get out. He surprised her by pulling her close to him and taking the cloth from her hands. She turned around and stepped back towards him. She reached up and moved her wet hair so her bare back was fully exposed to him. </p><p>She felt the cloth run over her shoulders. She didn\u2019t think he would really do it. Yet, here she was taking a shower with Tomura Shigaraki and he was currently running an exfoliating cloth down her shoulders, her spine, and down as close to her ass as he could get without actually touching it. She was about to step back under the water until she felt his lips against her neck avoiding the soap on her back. One of his arms circled her waist, his hand balled in a fist so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally touch her. He pulled her flush against him not letting her move. Two could play this game. </p><p>Hana pressed further until he was back to being sandwiched against her and the wall. She felt his erection pressing against her ass and she slowly, torturously, moved her hips against him. She heard him gasp, felt his breathing hitch, and his other arm wrapped across her chest. She leaned her head back against his shoulder and he left new kisses and bites on her neck. She continued to move against him slowly not giving him near enough friction to finish but just enough to torture him.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep teasing me you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d he threatened. She could hear the tone of his voice. She pushed. One of her hands slipped between them and she palmed his erection. Holy crap, this dude was not small. She wasn\u2019t expecting that. She had heard Dabi making jokes about him having a small dick. She could say with certainty he was definitely wrong. For the first time since pissing him off, she was genuinely afraid he would hurt her, just not with his lethal quirk. \u201cKohana\u2026 Don\u2019t make me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you what? Apologize to me?\u201d she let out a gasp as he bit harder into her neck. She palmed him a little harder and ran her hand down his length. Her fingers brushing over the head. She ran her thumb over his slit playing with the pre-cum that leaked from him. \u201cWhat would you really do to me, huh, Tomura?\u201d She didn\u2019t let on to how good this all felt. She had been feeling the wetness building between her legs and the heat pooling in her lower stomach. It all felt so good. He bit her harder damn near drawing blood.</p><p>\u201cKeep pushing me and I\u2019ll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what? Since you won\u2019t apologize to me, what will you do?\u201d She looked back at him with her big blue eyes staring into his crimson red eyes. The steam in the room was nearly unbearable and thick. One hand stayed on his length giving languid strokes and the other hand was digging nails into one of his arms. He dropped his arms letting her free. She stepped into the water to rinse her back and turned to see him mere inches from her face. She grinned up at him and batted her eyes. \u201cTo-mu-ra~\u201d she moved closer to him. \u201cWhat will you do to me?\u201d </p><p>He closed the gap between them and kissed her hard. If she had to guess due to the sloppy way he kissed her that this was his first kiss. It had to be. He wasn\u2019t the type to have a high school sweetheart that gave him his first go. She wrapped her arms around his neck. He kept one finger on each hand off her as he gripped her waist hard enough to bruise and slammed her against the heated tile. One hand kept her pinned while the other slid down her bare chest running smoothly over her nipple and over her breast. She shivered against him and moaned into his mouth. Her lips parted for air and he slipped his tongue past her lips. His knee slid in between her legs and pressed so close to her she was able to grind down on his knee as she was desperate for friction at this point. She moaned loudly as he attached himself to her neck again. Her fingers slid over his shoulders and down his back.</p><p>\u201cTomura\u2026please\u2026\u201d she moaned again feeling him push harder against her. She hated the fact she was reduced to begging. It all felt too good. They both smelled like lavender, the steam kept their faces flushed, his blue hair and her white hair were soaked and stuck to them. \u201cTell me what you want to do to me. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to break you. I want to bend you over this shower and fuck you until you\u2019re crying and begging for me to let you come. You were bad today. Taking your clothes off in front of the League. What am I gonna do with you? Should I even fuck you or should I get out now and leave you by yourself?\u201d the words came out as she reached down to stroke him again. She grinned. \u201cWipe that look off your face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d she asked looking into his eyes and running a hand in his pretty blue hair. She damn near shrieked as one of his fingers suddenly entered her. \u201cFuck!\u201d she cussed and he took the advantage to shove his mouth on hers again and fought with her own for dominance. She let him win. He kept his index finger inside her, his thumb on her clit teasing her, and the other three fingers to his palm so he didn\u2019t hurt her. He pumped into her slowly. He watched her eyes rolling in her head and she moaned loudly against him. He added a second finger and felt her natural juices flowing down his hand. </p><p>\u201cAre you really so wet for me? Does the idea of me nearly killing you really turn you on?\u201d he asked feeling her stroke him harder with little twists and jerks of her wrist. She kissed him on the lips and pressed a kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWould you really hurt me? I think you like me too much.\u201d she grinned and her face fell as he hit a specific spot inside her that had her clenching around his fingers. He swiftly removed his hand and forced her legs open more. He leaned down and slipped an arm under one of her knees. He lifted her leg exposing her most intimate areas to him completely. He lined himself up with her entrance.</p><p>\u201cBeg for me.\u201d he rubbed the tip of his cock against her slit but never going in. She actually looked down and paled a little. This was gonna hurt. The combination of his size and her not having been with anyone in the past year made her want to rethink this but at this point, she was sure neither of them actually could.</p><p>\u201cPlease Tomura, fuck me. I want you.\u201d she gripped his face in her hands and pulled him into another kiss. She exclaimed into the kiss as he sheathed himself inside her in one swift motion. \u201cFucking hell\u2026 Ow\u2026 Fuck\u2026 It hurts\u2026\u201d he didn\u2019t move, allowing her to adjust to the size of him. \u201cShit!\u201d she cussed. He slipped out slightly and slipped back in until he bottomed out. Her eyes scrunched up from the pain. She looked into his eyes. He seemed genuinely worried. His hand that wasn\u2019t holding her leg reached up and his thumb wiped away the tear that had fallen down her cheek. </p><p>\u201cI told you I would break you for being such a bad girl today.\u201d He pulled out and slammed himself back in making her cry out. The mix of pain and pleasure sent his name tumbling from her mouth. After a few more thrusts there was no more pain. He paused for a second to lift her other leg. Her legs were wrapped around his hips and she was stuck to the wall. He pistoned himself into her as his mouth wandered down her neck, chest, and breasts. He left kisses, bites, and dark hickeys on every bit of skin he could reach. He fisted her hair in his hand when she tried to move her neck away. It was a miracle her hair didn\u2019t decay. She was a dripping, needy, fucked up mess against him and he kept going until he could feel himself coming close. He felt her clenching around him with each thrust and knew she wouldn\u2019t last long either. \u201cYou take my cock so well. Aren\u2019t you a good girl for me? Can you cum for me? You will come for me. Cum on my cock like a good girl.\u201d he thrust into her harder and one of his hands drifted down to play with her clit. Her screams only got louder as he continued to fuck her into the wall and stroke her clit roughly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tomura! You feel so good. Please don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m so close! I promise I\u2019ll come for you. I\u2019m so\u2026\u201d she trailed off and screamed as she tumbled over the edge. She may have screamed a little too loudly because a sudden crashed nearly ruined the mood. He ignored it and kept going as his own end approached. A few thrusts later and he bottomed out cumming deep inside her with a growl and a shout of her name. They stayed in place, him still inside her as he finished releasing within her, her legs locked around him, and looked each other in the eyes. Red met blue. She gently stroked his cheek and he kissed her gently. Both of them stared with heaving chests trying to take deep breaths. The steam made it hard. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out,\u201d he spoke finally. She undid her legs from his hips and he turned the water off. She nearly fell and he kept her held up. Her legs felt like Jell-O and it hurt to walk. He felt somewhat bad for being so rough with her but it also made him a little smug. He stepped out and looked down to see what had happened. Her quirk had destroyed the bathroom mirror when she screamed. Most of it landed in the sink. There were a few shards on the floor. He didn\u2019t care. He reached for the towels that were hanging avoiding the glass. He passed one to her and she got out of the tub on sore, shaky legs. He wrapped a towel around his waist. Once she was covered he grabbed her and scooped her into his arms. His room was down the hall. He left their clothes sitting on the sink vowing to come back for them. She looked up at him with tired eyes. She hadn\u2019t expected this from him. This was very new. He was also much stronger than he looked since he seemed to have no trouble lifting and carrying her.</p><p>He opened the door to his room and set her gently on his bed. She dried off as he threw her an old T-shirt of his and he dressed in sweats and no shirt. He didn\u2019t give her any pants to wear so she figured she wasn\u2019t getting any underwear either. She wasn\u2019t bothered. After what had just transpired she was glad to have some coverage. The shirt hung off one shoulder and barely covered her ass.</p><p>He left the room for a few minutes to retrieve their clothes from the bathroom and inform Kurogiri that the mirror had been broken. Toga and Dabi were long gone. Kurogiri wished Shigaraki a good night as it was now late. Kurogiri did not ask what had happened to the mirror or where Hana was. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure it out based on what they\u2019d heard in the bathroom. Toga and Dabi had left the second they heard them talking in the hallway. He had a feeling they would give him shit for it later.</p><p>He went back into his room to see her lying on his bed, his shirt barely covered her ass, and the lack of underwear was a nice sight to see. She had already claimed a pillow. She was laying there waiting for him. She watched him move around the room with tired eyes. He wasn\u2019t going to admit this but it felt so weirdly pleasant knowing there was an extremely attractive girl, with no underwear on, wearing one of his shirts, waiting for him to join her in his bed. That was definitely an ego boost. He smiled at the thought of the possessive way he had her in his bed and how she was sitting there waiting for him. Why did this feel so good? He pulled on a pair of thick gloves so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally kill her during the night. </p><p>He slipped into bed next to her and she immediately cuddled up into his side. He froze as she snuggled into his side and made herself comfortable, even throwing a leg over his leg. She threw an arm across his chest and settled her fingers on his neck. She smelled so damn good. She rubbed the skin of his neck in a soothing way and he wasn\u2019t going to lie and say it didn\u2019t feel good.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Tomura.\u201d she left a kiss on his cheek. He didn\u2019t stop her and just looked at her for a moment. She had a smile on her face. He felt his heart beat harder in his chest. </p><p>\u201cGood night, flower girl.\u201d he forcefully kissed her lips and nuzzled his face in her lavender scented hair. She let him. He wrapped his arms around her as she drifted off first. He looked down at her knowing full well he was definitely gonna have a repeat of this tomorrow. Then, with a heavy sigh, sure that she was asleep, he muttered. \u201cSorry.\u201d He couldn\u2019t see her smirk in the dark.</p>",

It\u2019s not my best work and honestly, it\u2019s my first time writing something for the My Hero Academia fandom. I\u2019m fairly new to the fandom and this just popped into my head last night. I want to apologize for Shigaraki being OOC at all. The RP is not reader insert, she\u2019s my own OC. Long story short, her name is Kohana Mori. She\u2019s a villain in this one. She has white hair and blue eyes, pale skin, and is fairly thin. The RP for this one hasn\u2019t gone very far so not sure about much with her. Either way, please enjoy some deliciously pointless Tomura Shigaraki smut. Because he is one of my babies and needs more love. Side note: Her name translates to Little Flower Forest.</i></p><p><i>This is rated M. Features smut, cussing, and possible triggers. 18+ readers would be best but honestly, I can\u2019t exactly stop you. You have been warned. Also, possible dub-con because let\u2019s be honest, the teasing and threats get bad.</i></p><p><b>-</b></p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Shigaraki sounded furious as Hana came walking in the door of the bar fresh from a workout.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cWalking through the bar. Why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d He motioned to her body. At this moment the entire League was looking at the two of them. Mind you there were only Toga, Dabi, Kurogiri, herself, and Tomura in there currently so not many but still.</p><p>\u201cWearing what, Shigaraki?\u201d she asked unsure of what his problem was. The last few weeks he had been a particularly extra mean asshole to her. Also to Dabi, but mainly her.</p><p>\u201cThat!\u201d he motioned towards the All Might themed sports bra she was currently wearing complete with matching capris.</p><p>\u201cI received it as a gift from my best friend. And I happen to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the League of Villains. We are literally trying to kill the Hero you happen to be wearing.\u201d His hands itched at his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware but the set is cute!\u201d she protested. \u201cAnd it was a present. I\u2019m not gonna ignore a nice gift from a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a single shit. Take it off and dispose of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d Why the hell did he feel the need to be this big of an asshole?</p><p>\u201cTake it off!\u201d His impatience was just increasing. How dare she walk into his bar wearing that trash? It didn\u2019t help she was sweating and her hair was pulled up.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Once more?\u201d An idea formed in her mind.</p><p>\u201cTAKE IT OFF BEFORE I WRAP MY HANDS AROUND YOUR FUCKING NECK!\u201d She knew he meant it too. He was shaking in anger, Kurogiri keeping him held back. </p><p>\u201cTake it off?\u201d she gave him an incredulous look before sighing. \u201cOkay then. You asked for it. You win. I\u2019ll take it off.\u201d She got a big ass shit eating grin on her face. She looked around to every single one of the villains sitting in the bar and grabbed the edges of the capris. She yanked them down and stepped out revealing her black lace thong. There were a couple gasps and Shigaraki looked completely stunned. No one moved. She reached under the edges of the sports bra and yanked that over her head. She smirked at everyone in the bar. Her eyes went from Shigaraki to Toga and finally landed on Dabi who was ready to spit his drink. She bent over and picked up her fallen clothes. \u201cThere. They\u2019re off.\u201d She stood there completely bare except for the panties. And her socks.</p><p>Shigaraki wanted to yell but he was way too distracted. She threw the clothes over her shoulder and walked her petite little ass to the back where she could change and shower. </p><p>Thank goodness her dad hadn\u2019t been there to see this.</p><p>Shigaraki was silent and didn\u2019t move for a solid fifteen seconds before he shoved Kurogiri aside and stomped after Hana. Everyone else stayed in the bar trying to process what just happened. She was almost to the full bathroom with her bag of clothes, still naked, when Shigaraki stepped in-between her and the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something Shigaraki?\u201d She thrust her chest forward a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d he was just barely keeping his eyes from scanning over her body. No one had ever shocked him like that, except maybe Izuku Midoriya, and certainly never stripped naked in his bar.</p><p>\u201cYou yelled at me to take off my workout clothes. So I did. I only did what you wanted.\u201d she said with an innocent tone to her voice that he knew was fake as she stood on her tiptoes to bat her eyes at him. He looked furious. The itching at his neck increased as she noticed him looking down.</p><p>\u201cYou stripped naked in front of the whole bar you little slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, you\u2019re the only one who seemed to have a problem with it. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I just worked out, I\u2019m sweaty, and I need a shower.\u201d She reached up and let her long white hair fall from its messy bun and down her back. \u201cSo, unless you\u2019re gonna join me, get out of my way, please.\u201d He continued to block her. In retaliation, she stripped off her last remaining clothing items. Her socks went first tossing them over her shoulder. Then, she locked eyes with him as she shucked her panties down and kicked them off her ankles never once breaking eye contact.</p><p>He finally moved aside and let her pass him. He broke eye contact first as she walked past him and he stared at her ass. She knew exactly what she was doing as she bent over to turn on the water, leaving her clothes on the sink. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna close the door?\u201d she said looking back to him. He shut the door alright. When she turned around again he had shut the door and she heard the lock click. However, he was now not wearing a shirt. The hand he called \u2018Father\u2019 was sitting on top of his shirt on the counter. She never realized how skinny he actually was. His arms looked nice though even with the previous scars and bullet holes. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said to join you,\u201d he said and tugged at the drawstring of his pants. She turned around, her face heating up, and adjusted the water to boiling hot like she liked. She figured he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the heat. She pushed the curtain back completely and stepped in. \u201cSo, I\u2019m gonna join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I hope you like showers so hot they could melt skin.\u201d she was testing him now. There was no way he would actually do this. She looked back at him with a sarcastic toss of her long hair. This was a game of chicken and she was gonna win.</p><p>\u201cLast I checked I\u2019m the only thing in the League that can destroy skin so thoroughly.\u201d She felt his presence close to her back but she didn\u2019t turn around. She switched the water to shower and let it come down around them. If his clothes got wet then so what? If there was one thing she could say for this shitty bar in this shitty area, it had an amazing shower, thankfully kept clean by Kurogiri she assumed, and the water pressure was fantastic. She turned around looking him in the eye. She wasn\u2019t gonna look down. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to. She often forgot he was several inches taller than her. She was short as it was. He made her feel so small but her actions today had made her feel taller than him even if she did have to expose herself to half the League to do it. </p><p>\u201cHave you met Dabi? Such big talk,\u201d she said stepping completely into the stream. The steam from the showered filled the bathroom and she stared him in the eye daring him to try something. She decided to tease him a little. She turned around facing the shower and felt the steamy, hot water run through her sweaty scalp. She let out a moan as the water ran down her back and through her scalp. What could she say, it felt good. She raised her arms and let the water cover all of her skin washing the sweat and grime she felt. She let out a couple more soft moans. She turned and his crimson eyes were burning a hole in the back of her head. The steam had raised a flush to his skin. Yeah, it was the steam. She stepped aside to let him pass. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna get wet?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He stepped past her to step in the water stream. She smirked as she went for the lavender scented shampoo she had brought with her. She poured some into her hand and grinned her shit eating grin. Okay then. She reached up and put her shampoo in his hair. He flinched and turned around with a fast twist. </p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you doing?\u201d He looked annoyed but she simply stood on her tiptoes and continued.</p><p>\u201cJust thought you could use a little help. Hope you like lavender. Now, come here.\u201d she said cheerfully. He looked even more annoyed but reluctantly leaned down to let her finish. She got a thorough lather worked into his hair and she felt the tips of his fingers run over her arm. She let him. He kept his pinky off her so she wouldn\u2019t decay in the shower. She didn\u2019t let him know how nice it felt to be touched. It had been a while since she\u2019d had someone touch her. \u201cRinse.\u201d she turned away to pick the bottle back up and pour more into her hand. She lathered it into her own hair until she was covered in soap. She turned around with her eyes closed. She felt a hand on her wrist and he gently pulled her into the stream of water. She reached up to scrub her scalp until she was sure the soap was gone. When she opened them she was staring straight into Shigaraki\u2019s red eyes inches from her. </p><p>Her breathing hitched and his fingers ran over her arm again. She looked down and watched them. His touch actually felt nice. Even with it being so lethal. She looked back up to him with a smile. She reached one hand up and ran her thumb over the scar on his lips. He closed his eyes as she ran her fingers across his cheek, his eyelids, and into his hair. He seemed to relax into her touch. She smiled as she pressed against him. She felt something against her leg and knew what it was. She left a kiss on his cheek. </p><p>\u201cTo-mu-ra~\u201d she pressed tighter against him crushing him against the wall and her body. She left little kisses on his cheeks not once touching his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Haven\u2019t you ever been touched before?\u201d Her hands slipped around his neck gently sliding over the scarred skin of his own doing. She actually looked sad for a moment. She knew what it was like to be anxious and only have toxic outlets. She also knew just how touch starved this man was. His quirk wouldn\u2019t really allow for safe touch. Good thing she didn\u2019t fear death. She stood as tall as she could and left kisses on the skin of his neck. She tilted his chin upwards so she could reach easier. She felt him press closer to the wall as though he was afraid of her touch. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I promise I\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being nice,\u201d he stated. \u201cAfter what you pulled in the bar. After I yelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be mean if you want. Maybe I should punish you for yelling at me.\u201d She pressed tighter and bit gently into his neck. He gasped and felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe but she heard him groan over the sounds of the water running. She held his neck pulling him closer to her level. She bit down a little harder making sure to leave a mark. \u201cMaybe I should make you apologize for yelling at me and making me do that in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a better chance of killing All Might by yourself.\u201d He was pushing her. She was gonna push back. </p><p>\u201cFine then.\u201d she pulled away from him and stepped back into the stream of water. She bent over and reached for her body wash, also lavender scented, and poured some on an exfoliating cloth she brought with her. She ran it over her skin not once meeting his angry eyes. She went as far as to crank the water up a little hotter. He stepped out of the stream and she felt him watching her. She scrubbed her skin, making sure to do extra bending and twirling her hair. She smiled an evil little smile and turned around. \u201cWill you get my back? I\u2019ll do yours after if you like.\u201d she held out the cloth to him fully expecting him to ignore her or even get out. He surprised her by pulling her close to him and taking the cloth from her hands. She turned around and stepped back towards him. She reached up and moved her wet hair so her bare back was fully exposed to him. </p><p>She felt the cloth run over her shoulders. She didn\u2019t think he would really do it. Yet, here she was taking a shower with Tomura Shigaraki and he was currently running an exfoliating cloth down her shoulders, her spine, and down as close to her ass as he could get without actually touching it. She was about to step back under the water until she felt his lips against her neck avoiding the soap on her back. One of his arms circled her waist, his hand balled in a fist so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally touch her. He pulled her flush against him not letting her move. Two could play this game. </p><p>Hana pressed further until he was back to being sandwiched against her and the wall. She felt his erection pressing against her ass and she slowly, torturously, moved her hips against him. She heard him gasp, felt his breathing hitch, and his other arm wrapped across her chest. She leaned her head back against his shoulder and he left new kisses and bites on her neck. She continued to move against him slowly not giving him near enough friction to finish but just enough to torture him.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep teasing me you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d he threatened. She could hear the tone of his voice. She pushed. One of her hands slipped between them and she palmed his erection. Holy crap, this dude was not small. She wasn\u2019t expecting that. She had heard Dabi making jokes about him having a small dick. She could say with certainty he was definitely wrong. For the first time since pissing him off, she was genuinely afraid he would hurt her, just not with his lethal quirk. \u201cKohana\u2026 Don\u2019t make me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you what? Apologize to me?\u201d she let out a gasp as he bit harder into her neck. She palmed him a little harder and ran her hand down his length. Her fingers brushing over the head. She ran her thumb over his slit playing with the pre-cum that leaked from him. \u201cWhat would you really do to me, huh, Tomura?\u201d She didn\u2019t let on to how good this all felt. She had been feeling the wetness building between her legs and the heat pooling in her lower stomach. It all felt so good. He bit her harder damn near drawing blood.</p><p>\u201cKeep pushing me and I\u2019ll-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what? Since you won\u2019t apologize to me, what will you do?\u201d She looked back at him with her big blue eyes staring into his crimson red eyes. The steam in the room was nearly unbearable and thick. One hand stayed on his length giving languid strokes and the other hand was digging nails into one of his arms. He dropped his arms letting her free. She stepped into the water to rinse her back and turned to see him mere inches from her face. She grinned up at him and batted her eyes. \u201cTo-mu-ra~\u201d she moved closer to him. \u201cWhat will you do to me?\u201d </p><p>He closed the gap between them and kissed her hard. If she had to guess due to the sloppy way he kissed her that this was his first kiss. It had to be. He wasn\u2019t the type to have a high school sweetheart that gave him his first go. She wrapped her arms around his neck. He kept one finger on each hand off her as he gripped her waist hard enough to bruise and slammed her against the heated tile. One hand kept her pinned while the other slid down her bare chest running smoothly over her nipple and over her breast. She shivered against him and moaned into his mouth. Her lips parted for air and he slipped his tongue past her lips. His knee slid in between her legs and pressed so close to her she was able to grind down on his knee as she was desperate for friction at this point. She moaned loudly as he attached himself to her neck again. Her fingers slid over his shoulders and down his back.</p><p>\u201cTomura\u2026please\u2026\u201d she moaned again feeling him push harder against her. She hated the fact she was reduced to begging. It all felt too good. They both smelled like lavender, the steam kept their faces flushed, his blue hair and her white hair were soaked and stuck to them. \u201cTell me what you want to do to me. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to break you. I want to bend you over this shower and fuck you until you\u2019re crying and begging for me to let you come. You were bad today. Taking your clothes off in front of the League. What am I gonna do with you? Should I even fuck you or should I get out now and leave you by yourself?\u201d the words came out as she reached down to stroke him again. She grinned. \u201cWipe that look off your face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d she asked looking into his eyes and running a hand in his pretty blue hair. She damn near shrieked as one of his fingers suddenly entered her. \u201cFuck!\u201d she cussed and he took the advantage to shove his mouth on hers again and fought with her own for dominance. She let him win. He kept his index finger inside her, his thumb on her clit teasing her, and the other three fingers to his palm so he didn\u2019t hurt her. He pumped into her slowly. He watched her eyes rolling in her head and she moaned loudly against him. He added a second finger and felt her natural juices flowing down his hand. </p><p>\u201cAre you really so wet for me? Does the idea of me nearly killing you really turn you on?\u201d he asked feeling her stroke him harder with little twists and jerks of her wrist. She kissed him on the lips and pressed a kiss to his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWould you really hurt me? I think you like me too much.\u201d she grinned and her face fell as he hit a specific spot inside her that had her clenching around his fingers. He swiftly removed his hand and forced her legs open more. He leaned down and slipped an arm under one of her knees. He lifted her leg exposing her most intimate areas to him completely. He lined himself up with her entrance.</p><p>\u201cBeg for me.\u201d he rubbed the tip of his cock against her slit but never going in. She actually looked down and paled a little. This was gonna hurt. The combination of his size and her not having been with anyone in the past year made her want to rethink this but at this point, she was sure neither of them actually could.</p><p>\u201cPlease Tomura, fuck me. I want you.\u201d she gripped his face in her hands and pulled him into another kiss. She exclaimed into the kiss as he sheathed himself inside her in one swift motion. \u201cFucking hell\u2026 Ow\u2026 Fuck\u2026 It hurts\u2026\u201d he didn\u2019t move, allowing her to adjust to the size of him. \u201cShit!\u201d she cussed. He slipped out slightly and slipped back in until he bottomed out. Her eyes scrunched up from the pain. She looked into his eyes. He seemed genuinely worried. His hand that wasn\u2019t holding her leg reached up and his thumb wiped away the tear that had fallen down her cheek. </p><p>\u201cI told you I would break you for being such a bad girl today.\u201d He pulled out and slammed himself back in making her cry out. The mix of pain and pleasure sent his name tumbling from her mouth. After a few more thrusts there was no more pain. He paused for a second to lift her other leg. Her legs were wrapped around his hips and she was stuck to the wall. He pistoned himself into her as his mouth wandered down her neck, chest, and breasts. He left kisses, bites, and dark hickeys on every bit of skin he could reach. He fisted her hair in his hand when she tried to move her neck away. It was a miracle her hair didn\u2019t decay. She was a dripping, needy, fucked up mess against him and he kept going until he could feel himself coming close. He felt her clenching around him with each thrust and knew she wouldn\u2019t last long either. \u201cYou take my cock so well. Aren\u2019t you a good girl for me? Can you cum for me? You will come for me. Cum on my cock like a good girl.\u201d he thrust into her harder and one of his hands drifted down to play with her clit. Her screams only got louder as he continued to fuck her into the wall and stroke her clit roughly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tomura! You feel so good. Please don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m so close! I promise I\u2019ll come for you. I\u2019m so\u2026\u201d she trailed off and screamed as she tumbled over the edge. She may have screamed a little too loudly because a sudden crashed nearly ruined the mood. He ignored it and kept going as his own end approached. A few thrusts later and he bottomed out cumming deep inside her with a growl and a shout of her name. They stayed in place, him still inside her as he finished releasing within her, her legs locked around him, and looked each other in the eyes. Red met blue. She gently stroked his cheek and he kissed her gently. Both of them stared with heaving chests trying to take deep breaths. The steam made it hard. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out,\u201d he spoke finally. She undid her legs from his hips and he turned the water off. She nearly fell and he kept her held up. Her legs felt like Jell-O and it hurt to walk. He felt somewhat bad for being so rough with her but it also made him a little smug. He stepped out and looked down to see what had happened. Her quirk had destroyed the bathroom mirror when she screamed. Most of it landed in the sink. There were a few shards on the floor. He didn\u2019t care. He reached for the towels that were hanging avoiding the glass. He passed one to her and she got out of the tub on sore, shaky legs. He wrapped a towel around his waist. Once she was covered he grabbed her and scooped her into his arms. His room was down the hall. He left their clothes sitting on the sink vowing to come back for them. She looked up at him with tired eyes. She hadn\u2019t expected this from him. This was very new. He was also much stronger than he looked since he seemed to have no trouble lifting and carrying her.</p><p>He opened the door to his room and set her gently on his bed. She dried off as he threw her an old T-shirt of his and he dressed in sweats and no shirt. He didn\u2019t give her any pants to wear so she figured she wasn\u2019t getting any underwear either. She wasn\u2019t bothered. After what had just transpired she was glad to have some coverage. The shirt hung off one shoulder and barely covered her ass.</p><p>He left the room for a few minutes to retrieve their clothes from the bathroom and inform Kurogiri that the mirror had been broken. Toga and Dabi were long gone. Kurogiri wished Shigaraki a good night as it was now late. Kurogiri did not ask what had happened to the mirror or where Hana was. It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure it out based on what they\u2019d heard in the bathroom. Toga and Dabi had left the second they heard them talking in the hallway. He had a feeling they would give him shit for it later.</p><p>He went back into his room to see her lying on his bed, his shirt barely covered her ass, and the lack of underwear was a nice sight to see. She had already claimed a pillow. She was laying there waiting for him. She watched him move around the room with tired eyes. He wasn\u2019t going to admit this but it felt so weirdly pleasant knowing there was an extremely attractive girl, with no underwear on, wearing one of his shirts, waiting for him to join her in his bed. That was definitely an ego boost. He smiled at the thought of the possessive way he had her in his bed and how she was sitting there waiting for him. Why did this feel so good? He pulled on a pair of thick gloves so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally kill her during the night. </p><p>He slipped into bed next to her and she immediately cuddled up into his side. He froze as she snuggled into his side and made herself comfortable, even throwing a leg over his leg. She threw an arm across his chest and settled her fingers on his neck. She smelled so damn good. She rubbed the skin of his neck in a soothing way and he wasn\u2019t going to lie and say it didn\u2019t feel good.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Tomura.\u201d she left a kiss on his cheek. He didn\u2019t stop her and just looked at her for a moment. She had a smile on her face. He felt his heart beat harder in his chest. </p><p>\u201cGood night, flower girl.\u201d he forcefully kissed her lips and nuzzled his face in her lavender scented hair. She let him. He wrapped his arms around her as she drifted off first. He looked down at her knowing full well he was definitely gonna have a repeat of this tomorrow. Then, with a heavy sigh, sure that she was asleep, he muttered. \u201cSorry.\u201d He couldn\u2019t see her smirk in the dark.</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>So, let me say this, this is from an RP my bestie and I was doing. I wrote this on Google Docs and figured, why not post it! It&rsquo;s not my best work and honestly, it&rsquo;s my first time writing something for the My Hero Academia fandom. I&rsquo;m fairly new to the fandom and this just popped into my head last night. I want to apologize for Shigaraki being OOC at all. The RP is not reader insert, she&rsquo;s my own OC. Long story short, her name is Kohana Mori. She&rsquo;s a villain in this one. She has white hair and blue eyes, pale skin, and is fairly thin. The RP for this one hasn&rsquo;t gone very far so not sure about much with her. Either way, please enjoy some deliciously pointless Tomura Shigaraki smut. Because he is one of my babies and needs more love. Side note: Her name translates to Little Flower Forest.</i></p><p><i>This is rated M. Features smut, cussing, and possible triggers. 18+ readers would be best but honestly, I can&rsquo;t exactly stop you. You have been warned. Also, possible dub-con because let&rsquo;s be honest, the teasing and threats get bad.</i></p><p><b>-</b></p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; Shigaraki sounded furious as Hana came walking in the door of the bar fresh from a workout.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Walking through the bar. Why?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you wearing that?&rdquo; He motioned to her body. At this moment the entire League was looking at the two of them. Mind you there were only Toga, Dabi, Kurogiri, herself, and Tomura in there currently so not many but still.</p><p>&ldquo;Wearing what, Shigaraki?&rdquo; she asked unsure of what his problem was. The last few weeks he had been a particularly extra mean asshole to her. Also to Dabi, but mainly her.</p><p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; he motioned towards the All Might themed sports bra she was currently wearing complete with matching capris.</p><p>&ldquo;I received it as a gift from my best friend. And I happen to like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is the League of Villains. We are literally trying to kill the Hero you happen to be wearing.&rdquo; His hands itched at his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware but the set is cute!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;And it was a present. I&rsquo;m not gonna ignore a nice gift from a friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a single shit. Take it off and dispose of it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to what?&rdquo; Why the hell did he feel the need to be this big of an asshole?</p><p>&ldquo;Take it off!&rdquo; His impatience was just increasing. How dare she walk into his bar wearing that trash? It didn&rsquo;t help she was sweating and her hair was pulled up.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me? Once more?&rdquo; An idea formed in her mind.</p><p>&ldquo;TAKE IT OFF BEFORE I WRAP MY HANDS AROUND YOUR FUCKING NECK!&rdquo; She knew he meant it too. He was shaking in anger, Kurogiri keeping him held back. </p><p>&ldquo;Take it off?&rdquo; she gave him an incredulous look before sighing. &ldquo;Okay then. You asked for it. You win. I&rsquo;ll take it off.&rdquo; She got a big ass shit eating grin on her face. She looked around to every single one of the villains sitting in the bar and grabbed the edges of the capris. She yanked them down and stepped out revealing her black lace thong. There were a couple gasps and Shigaraki looked completely stunned. No one moved. She reached under the edges of the sports bra and yanked that over her head. She smirked at everyone in the bar. Her eyes went from Shigaraki to Toga and finally landed on Dabi who was ready to spit his drink. She bent over and picked up her fallen clothes. &ldquo;There. They&rsquo;re off.&rdquo; She stood there completely bare except for the panties. And her socks.</p><p>Shigaraki wanted to yell but he was way too distracted. She threw the clothes over her shoulder and walked her petite little ass to the back where she could change and shower. </p><p>Thank goodness her dad hadn&rsquo;t been there to see this.</p><p>Shigaraki was silent and didn&rsquo;t move for a solid fifteen seconds before he shoved Kurogiri aside and stomped after Hana. Everyone else stayed in the bar trying to process what just happened. She was almost to the full bathroom with her bag of clothes, still naked, when Shigaraki stepped in-between her and the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you need something Shigaraki?&rdquo; She thrust her chest forward a little.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck was that?&rdquo; he was just barely keeping his eyes from scanning over her body. No one had ever shocked him like that, except maybe Izuku Midoriya, and certainly never stripped naked in his bar.</p><p>&ldquo;You yelled at me to take off my workout clothes. So I did. I only did what you wanted.&rdquo; she said with an innocent tone to her voice that he knew was fake as she stood on her tiptoes to bat her eyes at him. He looked furious. The itching at his neck increased as she noticed him looking down.</p><p>&ldquo;You stripped naked in front of the whole bar you little slut.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yet, you&rsquo;re the only one who seemed to have a problem with it. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I just worked out, I&rsquo;m sweaty, and I need a shower.&rdquo; She reached up and let her long white hair fall from its messy bun and down her back. &ldquo;So, unless you&rsquo;re gonna join me, get out of my way, please.&rdquo; He continued to block her. In retaliation, she stripped off her last remaining clothing items. Her socks went first tossing them over her shoulder. Then, she locked eyes with him as she shucked her panties down and kicked them off her ankles never once breaking eye contact.</p><p>He finally moved aside and let her pass him. He broke eye contact first as she walked past him and he stared at her ass. She knew exactly what she was doing as she bent over to turn on the water, leaving her clothes on the sink. </p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you gonna close the door?&rdquo; she said looking back to him. He shut the door alright. When she turned around again he had shut the door and she heard the lock click. However, he was now not wearing a shirt. The hand he called &lsquo;Father&rsquo; was sitting on top of his shirt on the counter. She never realized how skinny he actually was. His arms looked nice though even with the previous scars and bullet holes. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You said to join you,&rdquo; he said and tugged at the drawstring of his pants. She turned around, her face heating up, and adjusted the water to boiling hot like she liked. She figured he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle the heat. She pushed the curtain back completely and stepped in. &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m gonna join you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. I hope you like showers so hot they could melt skin.&rdquo; she was testing him now. There was no way he would actually do this. She looked back at him with a sarcastic toss of her long hair. This was a game of chicken and she was gonna win.</p><p>&ldquo;Last I checked I&rsquo;m the only thing in the League that can destroy skin so thoroughly.&rdquo; She felt his presence close to her back but she didn&rsquo;t turn around. She switched the water to shower and let it come down around them. If his clothes got wet then so what? If there was one thing she could say for this shitty bar in this shitty area, it had an amazing shower, thankfully kept clean by Kurogiri she assumed, and the water pressure was fantastic. She turned around looking him in the eye. She wasn&rsquo;t gonna look down. She couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to. She often forgot he was several inches taller than her. She was short as it was. He made her feel so small but her actions today had made her feel taller than him even if she did have to expose herself to half the League to do it. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you met Dabi? Such big talk,&rdquo; she said stepping completely into the stream. The steam from the showered filled the bathroom and she stared him in the eye daring him to try something. She decided to tease him a little. She turned around facing the shower and felt the steamy, hot water run through her sweaty scalp. She let out a moan as the water ran down her back and through her scalp. What could she say, it felt good. She raised her arms and let the water cover all of her skin washing the sweat and grime she felt. She let out a couple more soft moans. She turned and his crimson eyes were burning a hole in the back of her head. The steam had raised a flush to his skin. Yeah, it was the steam. She stepped aside to let him pass. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you gonna get wet?&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t answer. He stepped past her to step in the water stream. She smirked as she went for the lavender scented shampoo she had brought with her. She poured some into her hand and grinned her shit eating grin. Okay then. She reached up and put her shampoo in his hair. He flinched and turned around with a fast twist. </p><p>&ldquo;What exactly are you doing?&rdquo; He looked annoyed but she simply stood on her tiptoes and continued.</p><p>&ldquo;Just thought you could use a little help. Hope you like lavender. Now, come here.&rdquo; she said cheerfully. He looked even more annoyed but reluctantly leaned down to let her finish. She got a thorough lather worked into his hair and she felt the tips of his fingers run over her arm. She let him. He kept his pinky off her so she wouldn&rsquo;t decay in the shower. She didn&rsquo;t let him know how nice it felt to be touched. It had been a while since she&rsquo;d had someone touch her. &ldquo;Rinse.&rdquo; she turned away to pick the bottle back up and pour more into her hand. She lathered it into her own hair until she was covered in soap. She turned around with her eyes closed. She felt a hand on her wrist and he gently pulled her into the stream of water. She reached up to scrub her scalp until she was sure the soap was gone. When she opened them she was staring straight into Shigaraki&rsquo;s red eyes inches from her. </p><p>Her breathing hitched and his fingers ran over her arm again. She looked down and watched them. His touch actually felt nice. Even with it being so lethal. She looked back up to him with a smile. She reached one hand up and ran her thumb over the scar on his lips. He closed his eyes as she ran her fingers across his cheek, his eyelids, and into his hair. He seemed to relax into her touch. She smiled as she pressed against him. She felt something against her leg and knew what it was. She left a kiss on his cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;To-mu-ra~&rdquo; she pressed tighter against him crushing him against the wall and her body. She left little kisses on his cheeks not once touching his lips. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Haven&rsquo;t you ever been touched before?&rdquo; Her hands slipped around his neck gently sliding over the scarred skin of his own doing. She actually looked sad for a moment. She knew what it was like to be anxious and only have toxic outlets. She also knew just how touch starved this man was. His quirk wouldn&rsquo;t really allow for safe touch. Good thing she didn&rsquo;t fear death. She stood as tall as she could and left kisses on the skin of his neck. She tilted his chin upwards so she could reach easier. She felt him press closer to the wall as though he was afraid of her touch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I promise I&rsquo;m not gonna hurt you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being nice,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;After what you pulled in the bar. After I yelled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can be mean if you want. Maybe I should punish you for yelling at me.&rdquo; She pressed tighter and bit gently into his neck. He gasped and felt like he couldn&rsquo;t breathe but she heard him groan over the sounds of the water running. She held his neck pulling him closer to her level. She bit down a little harder making sure to leave a mark. &ldquo;Maybe I should make you apologize for yelling at me and making me do that in front of everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have a better chance of killing All Might by yourself.&rdquo; He was pushing her. She was gonna push back. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine then.&rdquo; she pulled away from him and stepped back into the stream of water. She bent over and reached for her body wash, also lavender scented, and poured some on an exfoliating cloth she brought with her. She ran it over her skin not once meeting his angry eyes. She went as far as to crank the water up a little hotter. He stepped out of the stream and she felt him watching her. She scrubbed her skin, making sure to do extra bending and twirling her hair. She smiled an evil little smile and turned around. &ldquo;Will you get my back? I&rsquo;ll do yours after if you like.&rdquo; she held out the cloth to him fully expecting him to ignore her or even get out. He surprised her by pulling her close to him and taking the cloth from her hands. She turned around and stepped back towards him. She reached up and moved her wet hair so her bare back was fully exposed to him. </p><p>She felt the cloth run over her shoulders. She didn&rsquo;t think he would really do it. Yet, here she was taking a shower with Tomura Shigaraki and he was currently running an exfoliating cloth down her shoulders, her spine, and down as close to her ass as he could get without actually touching it. She was about to step back under the water until she felt his lips against her neck avoiding the soap on her back. One of his arms circled her waist, his hand balled in a fist so he wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally touch her. He pulled her flush against him not letting her move. Two could play this game. </p><p>Hana pressed further until he was back to being sandwiched against her and the wall. She felt his erection pressing against her ass and she slowly, torturously, moved her hips against him. She heard him gasp, felt his breathing hitch, and his other arm wrapped across her chest. She leaned her head back against his shoulder and he left new kisses and bites on her neck. She continued to move against him slowly not giving him near enough friction to finish but just enough to torture him.</p><p>&ldquo;If you keep teasing me you&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo; he threatened. She could hear the tone of his voice. She pushed. One of her hands slipped between them and she palmed his erection. Holy crap, this dude was not small. She wasn&rsquo;t expecting that. She had heard Dabi making jokes about him having a small dick. She could say with certainty he was definitely wrong. For the first time since pissing him off, she was genuinely afraid he would hurt her, just not with his lethal quirk. &ldquo;Kohana&hellip; Don&rsquo;t make me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Make you what? Apologize to me?&rdquo; she let out a gasp as he bit harder into her neck. She palmed him a little harder and ran her hand down his length. Her fingers brushing over the head. She ran her thumb over his slit playing with the pre-cum that leaked from him. &ldquo;What would you really do to me, huh, Tomura?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t let on to how good this all felt. She had been feeling the wetness building between her legs and the heat pooling in her lower stomach. It all felt so good. He bit her harder damn near drawing blood.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep pushing me and I&rsquo;ll-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll what? Since you won&rsquo;t apologize to me, what will you do?&rdquo; She looked back at him with her big blue eyes staring into his crimson red eyes. The steam in the room was nearly unbearable and thick. One hand stayed on his length giving languid strokes and the other hand was digging nails into one of his arms. He dropped his arms letting her free. She stepped into the water to rinse her back and turned to see him mere inches from her face. She grinned up at him and batted her eyes. &ldquo;To-mu-ra~&rdquo; she moved closer to him. &ldquo;What will you do to me?&rdquo; </p><p>He closed the gap between them and kissed her hard. If she had to guess due to the sloppy way he kissed her that this was his first kiss. It had to be. He wasn&rsquo;t the type to have a high school sweetheart that gave him his first go. She wrapped her arms around his neck. He kept one finger on each hand off her as he gripped her waist hard enough to bruise and slammed her against the heated tile. One hand kept her pinned while the other slid down her bare chest running smoothly over her nipple and over her breast. She shivered against him and moaned into his mouth. Her lips parted for air and he slipped his tongue past her lips. His knee slid in between her legs and pressed so close to her she was able to grind down on his knee as she was desperate for friction at this point. She moaned loudly as he attached himself to her neck again. Her fingers slid over his shoulders and down his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Tomura&hellip;please&hellip;&rdquo; she moaned again feeling him push harder against her. She hated the fact she was reduced to begging. It all felt too good. They both smelled like lavender, the steam kept their faces flushed, his blue hair and her white hair were soaked and stuck to them. &ldquo;Tell me what you want to do to me. Please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to break you. I want to bend you over this shower and fuck you until you&rsquo;re crying and begging for me to let you come. You were bad today. Taking your clothes off in front of the League. What am I gonna do with you? Should I even fuck you or should I get out now and leave you by yourself?&rdquo; the words came out as she reached down to stroke him again. She grinned. &ldquo;Wipe that look off your face!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; she asked looking into his eyes and running a hand in his pretty blue hair. She damn near shrieked as one of his fingers suddenly entered her. &ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; she cussed and he took the advantage to shove his mouth on hers again and fought with her own for dominance. She let him win. He kept his index finger inside her, his thumb on her clit teasing her, and the other three fingers to his palm so he didn&rsquo;t hurt her. He pumped into her slowly. He watched her eyes rolling in her head and she moaned loudly against him. He added a second finger and felt her natural juices flowing down his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you really so wet for me? Does the idea of me nearly killing you really turn you on?&rdquo; he asked feeling her stroke him harder with little twists and jerks of her wrist. She kissed him on the lips and pressed a kiss to his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you really hurt me? I think you like me too much.&rdquo; she grinned and her face fell as he hit a specific spot inside her that had her clenching around his fingers. He swiftly removed his hand and forced her legs open more. He leaned down and slipped an arm under one of her knees. He lifted her leg exposing her most intimate areas to him completely. He lined himself up with her entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Beg for me.&rdquo; he rubbed the tip of his cock against her slit but never going in. She actually looked down and paled a little. This was gonna hurt. The combination of his size and her not having been with anyone in the past year made her want to rethink this but at this point, she was sure neither of them actually could.</p><p>&ldquo;Please Tomura, fuck me. I want you.&rdquo; she gripped his face in her hands and pulled him into another kiss. She exclaimed into the kiss as he sheathed himself inside her in one swift motion. &ldquo;Fucking hell&hellip; Ow&hellip; Fuck&hellip; It hurts&hellip;&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t move, allowing her to adjust to the size of him. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; she cussed. He slipped out slightly and slipped back in until he bottomed out. Her eyes scrunched up from the pain. She looked into his eyes. He seemed genuinely worried. His hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding her leg reached up and his thumb wiped away the tear that had fallen down her cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;I told you I would break you for being such a bad girl today.&rdquo; He pulled out and slammed himself back in making her cry out. The mix of pain and pleasure sent his name tumbling from her mouth. After a few more thrusts there was no more pain. He paused for a second to lift her other leg. Her legs were wrapped around his hips and she was stuck to the wall. He pistoned himself into her as his mouth wandered down her neck, chest, and breasts. He left kisses, bites, and dark hickeys on every bit of skin he could reach. He fisted her hair in his hand when she tried to move her neck away. It was a miracle her hair didn&rsquo;t decay. She was a dripping, needy, fucked up mess against him and he kept going until he could feel himself coming close. He felt her clenching around him with each thrust and knew she wouldn&rsquo;t last long either. &ldquo;You take my cock so well. Aren&rsquo;t you a good girl for me? Can you cum for me? You will come for me. Cum on my cock like a good girl.&rdquo; he thrust into her harder and one of his hands drifted down to play with her clit. Her screams only got louder as he continued to fuck her into the wall and stroke her clit roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Tomura! You feel so good. Please don&rsquo;t stop, I&rsquo;m so close! I promise I&rsquo;ll come for you. I&rsquo;m so&hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off and screamed as she tumbled over the edge. She may have screamed a little too loudly because a sudden crashed nearly ruined the mood. He ignored it and kept going as his own end approached. A few thrusts later and he bottomed out cumming deep inside her with a growl and a shout of her name. They stayed in place, him still inside her as he finished releasing within her, her legs locked around him, and looked each other in the eyes. Red met blue. She gently stroked his cheek and he kissed her gently. Both of them stared with heaving chests trying to take deep breaths. The steam made it hard. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out,&rdquo; he spoke finally. She undid her legs from his hips and he turned the water off. She nearly fell and he kept her held up. Her legs felt like Jell-O and it hurt to walk. He felt somewhat bad for being so rough with her but it also made him a little smug. He stepped out and looked down to see what had happened. Her quirk had destroyed the bathroom mirror when she screamed. Most of it landed in the sink. There were a few shards on the floor. He didn&rsquo;t care. He reached for the towels that were hanging avoiding the glass. He passed one to her and she got out of the tub on sore, shaky legs. He wrapped a towel around his waist. Once she was covered he grabbed her and scooped her into his arms. His room was down the hall. He left their clothes sitting on the sink vowing to come back for them. She looked up at him with tired eyes. She hadn&rsquo;t expected this from him. This was very new. He was also much stronger than he looked since he seemed to have no trouble lifting and carrying her.</p><p>He opened the door to his room and set her gently on his bed. She dried off as he threw her an old T-shirt of his and he dressed in sweats and no shirt. He didn&rsquo;t give her any pants to wear so she figured she wasn&rsquo;t getting any underwear either. She wasn&rsquo;t bothered. After what had just transpired she was glad to have some coverage. The shirt hung off one shoulder and barely covered her ass.</p><p>He left the room for a few minutes to retrieve their clothes from the bathroom and inform Kurogiri that the mirror had been broken. Toga and Dabi were long gone. Kurogiri wished Shigaraki a good night as it was now late. Kurogiri did not ask what had happened to the mirror or where Hana was. It didn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure it out based on what they&rsquo;d heard in the bathroom. Toga and Dabi had left the second they heard them talking in the hallway. He had a feeling they would give him shit for it later.</p><p>He went back into his room to see her lying on his bed, his shirt barely covered her ass, and the lack of underwear was a nice sight to see. She had already claimed a pillow. She was laying there waiting for him. She watched him move around the room with tired eyes. He wasn&rsquo;t going to admit this but it felt so weirdly pleasant knowing there was an extremely attractive girl, with no underwear on, wearing one of his shirts, waiting for him to join her in his bed. That was definitely an ego boost. He smiled at the thought of the possessive way he had her in his bed and how she was sitting there waiting for him. Why did this feel so good? He pulled on a pair of thick gloves so he wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally kill her during the night. </p><p>He slipped into bed next to her and she immediately cuddled up into his side. He froze as she snuggled into his side and made herself comfortable, even throwing a leg over his leg. She threw an arm across his chest and settled her fingers on his neck. She smelled so damn good. She rubbed the skin of his neck in a soothing way and he wasn&rsquo;t going to lie and say it didn&rsquo;t feel good.</p><p>&ldquo;Good night, Tomura.&rdquo; she left a kiss on his cheek. He didn&rsquo;t stop her and just looked at her for a moment. She had a smile on her face. He felt his heart beat harder in his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Good night, flower girl.&rdquo; he forcefully kissed her lips and nuzzled his face in her lavender scented hair. She let him. He wrapped his arms around her as she drifted off first. He looked down at her knowing full well he was definitely gonna have a repeat of this tomorrow. Then, with a heavy sigh, sure that she was asleep, he muttered. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t see her smirk in the dark.</p>",
