He tugs his hood over his head, pressing his face against the wall of the train. His knee bounces. His fingertips burn. He curls his hands into fists and sucks in a steady breath to keep from singing the sleeves of his tunic with his bare hands.\n</p><p>\n  He shouldn\u2019t be thinking such things. Before him lies a city that he knows fought valiantly, built itself back up after the war into something beautiful. It\u2019s full of sloped green and yellow roofs and plants blooming in the summer heat, and Dan just wishes he was back home, where walls were made of dark metal and the air seemed to shimmer with sparks.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019d never been to the Earth Kingdom. Though the war had ended and the four Nations now lived in peace as a single, United Republic, travel was still arduous, and Dan had never been particularly adventurous.\n</p><p>\n  In front of him, a child is running up and down the aisle. Across from him, a man is reading a book, glasses perched now on his nose. Next to him, the seat is empty.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swipes his fringe across his forehead and tries not to think too much about why.\n</p><p>\n  The train shudders to a stop eventually. The people of the Earth Kingdom seem to stand in unison, and Dan feels clumsy on his feet when he shoots up a second later. He stumbles down the steps.\n</p><p>\n  The ground here is sandy. He tries not to miss the stone from back home.\n</p><p>\n  He glances down at the map he was given, following its path through the city, past a shop that smells of Jasmine and another with pottery on display. It\u2019s not far from the train stop, the building with the Earth Kingdom symbol above it\u2019s door. \n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Master Phil\u2019s Earthbending Academy, \n  </i>\n  is written on the sign.\n</p><p>\n  Dan pushes the door open. A bell chimes above his head. A man with black hair and a beige shirt is standing there.\n</p><p>\n  He smiles. \u201cDan, right?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan can do nothing but nod.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re firebending Master speaks highly of you,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  They\u2019re sitting in a back room then, on cushions of plush green fabric. Dan\u2019s fingers dig into his knees so he doesn\u2019t fidget, so he doesn\u2019t risk fire sizzling from his palms.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m quite powerful,\u201d he says. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cAs have I,\u201d says Phil. Dan\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s talking about Dan or about himself. He doesn\u2019t bother to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s control you lack, correct?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He nods. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile quirks at just one corner of his mouth. \u201cI can help you with that,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Phil stands slowly, steadily, and picks up the cushion he\u2019d been kneeling on to toss it aside. Dan would laugh at it hitting the wall and falling atop a pot Dan\u2019s fairly certain Phil hadn\u2019t meant to touch, but he\u2019d been told by his Master that Phil was someone to respect.\n</p><p>\n  Master Lester, they\u2019d called him back home, but Phil\u2019s never mentioned his last name or his title.\n</p><p>\n  He looks back at Dan, a hint of laughter in his eyes. \u201cYou can stand, too,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, it would probably be better if you stood.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He grabs his cushion, too, and sets it aside more gently than Phil had, so the floor is empty. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019d like you to show me your firebending,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stomach sinks. He glances at the curtains open over windows and banners hanging from the ceiling, and tries not to think about the things he\u2019s accidentally lit aflame back home, in a kingdom built for his element. Here, he thinks, he could burn far too much.\n</p><p>\n  Phil must notice his frown. \u201cYou can stop it, can\u2019t you?\u201d he asks. And then, as though to prove his point, he opens his palm over the ground and raises a column of earth next to him, stopping at the perfect height to perch his arm on.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course I can stop it,\u201d hisses Dan. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil jerks his head to the side, still smiling. \u201cWell then, go ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He punches forward so a burst of flames flies towards a bare part of the wall. And again just for the sake of it. His open palm makes a stream of fire shoot forward, and a practiced flick of his wrist sends it whipping towards the ceiling. A spinning kick has a ring of fire forming at his feet, expanding until\u2013\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay, stop!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s pressed against the wall then. His column of earth has disappeared, his smile faded. Dan collapses forward, unsteady on his feet. A last burst of fire explodes from his fingertips, but he manages to stop it before it hits a drape hanging on the far wall.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, breath coming too quick.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Phil pushes himself off the wall, and side eyes a faint dark spot on one of his banners, where the fabric\u2019s been singed black. \n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his cheeks burn. He curls his hands into fists to keep the embarrassment from forming fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSorry,\u201d he repeats.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cReally, it\u2019s alright,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI agreed to help train you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to feel small when he mumbles: \u201cAnd?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Another lopsided smile quirks at the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth. \u201cAnd I think I can,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s set Dan up a room in his house.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s small, with a narrow bed wedged into the corner and little plants resting on the sill of a window looking over an alleyway. Phil\u2019s leaning against the door as Dan drops his bag, haphazardly stuffed full of Fire Nation clothing, by the foot of the bed. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI know it\u2019s not much,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles. \u201cI appreciate the hospitality.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He goes to bow, but Phil waves a hand before he can. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t burn Poe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cPoe?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  A hint of laughter gleams in Phil\u2019s eyes. He motions over Dan\u2019s shoulder, towards the window. \u201cThe little plant,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s special to me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. He makes a mental note to always tuck his hand nearest the wall under his duvet before falling asleep, lest his dreams make him firebend. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d says Phil. He pushes himself off the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s tea in the kitchen if you\u2019d like any before bed. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t need any help heating it up?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels himself grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine, sir.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, just once. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says, before turning around, walking away with slow, steady steps.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with breathing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s standing in the middle of the room when he says it, holding pebbles he picked up off the floor in his hand. He sucks in a deep breath, and sends one flying across the room into the furthest pot he has. Then the second, into a flowerpot he has by the door. And the third, which lands at Dan\u2019s feet. \n</p><p>\n  Dan wonders, for a moment, if it\u2019s supposed to be intimidating, but Phil just looks amused.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m bad at breathing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil flicks his hand, and the stone at Dan\u2019s feet flies back into his palm. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important for firebending, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. \u201cIt is, yes.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThen you\u2019ll need to learn it,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He walks across the room, picks up one the cushions they sat on yesterday, and tosses it towards Dan. His aim\u2019s off, so it lands a few feet away with a quiet thud. Dan walks over to get it, returning it to his spot in the middle of the room, Phil watching him the whole time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits, legs crossed like they do back home.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you expect me to breathe evenly while you stare?\u201d he asks, perhaps a little more rude than his Master back home would permit.\n</p><p>\n  Phil just grins, and picks up a second cushion. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to breathe with you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They do nothing but breathe for the first day. \n</p><p>\n  Afterwards, Phil takes Dan out into the city, to a restaurant he likes to eat at when, in his own words, he\u2019s too lazy to cook. They eat more vegetables in the Earth Kingdom, Dan notices, as he watches Phil stuff a dumpling into his mouth, grinning as he watches Dan sip his tea.\n</p><p>\n  The second day, they breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  For lunch, Phil makes soup on a fire he trusts Dan to maintain, reminding him to breathe every time the flames burn too bright. Dan\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s a little overcooked by the end, and some of the broth boiled over the edge of the pot, but Phil doesn\u2019t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  The third day, they breathe \n  <i>\n    again. \n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Dan rests his hands on his knees and tries to count his breaths, slow counts of four and eight as he listens to the quiet puffs of Phil\u2019s from across the room. He fidgets. He knows he does, his feet going tingly numb and his shoulders aching from sitting up straight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cStay still,\u201d Phil says from across the room. \n</p><p>\n  When Dan opens his eyes, Phil\u2019s are still closed. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI can feel the earth moving,\u201d he says, like he knows Dan is staring.\n</p><p>\n  Dan lets his eyes fall closed and tries to breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  The fourth day, Phil\u2019s footsteps interrupt the silence.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s moved before calling for a break. Dan feels his chest go tight, his shoulders tense. He hears the hitch of his own breath, and the stilling of Phil\u2019s steps in response.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBreathe,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He counts to four in his head, lips moving around silent words, before sucking in another breath. Phil\u2019s footsteps echo in the room again, quiet, slow. Dan tries not to focus on the anxiety prickling at his spine.\n</p><p>\n  He wonders if it\u2019s his imagination, or if Phil\u2019s really staring at him so intently.\n</p><p>\n  The footsteps stop. Dan\u2019s breath hitches mid-exhale. There\u2019s a rustle of fabric behind him, and then a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re still tense,\u201d says Phil. He\u2019s so close, suddenly, that Dan can feel a rush of warm breath against his ear. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, holding his breath for a count of eight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you get anxious?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. \u201cYou know I do. My Master must have told you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cHe did,\u201d he admits. \u201cI wanted to hear it from you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn\u2019t ask why. He squeezes his eyes closed against the burn there, feeling his ribs shudder around another breath. The hand on his shoulder drifts down along his spine, slow and gentle, before settling on his side, splayed across his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou breathe in your chest,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIsn\u2019t that where your lungs are?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He laughs, still so close Dan can feel it. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you should breathe lower, deeper. It\u2019s more centering.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil draws away, stands up, and walks across the room, back to his own cushion.\n</p><p>\n  If he notices the shakiness in Dan\u2019s breathing, he doesn\u2019t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They leave the city on the seventh day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits on a train just like the one he arrived on, watching the city grow smaller, sparcer, until they pass the wall and it seems to disappear altogether. Phil\u2019s sitting next to him, leaning forward so they can look out the same window, their legs pressed together between their seats.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cLeft the city?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cI used to do it all the time when I was in training,\u201d he says. \u201cBut most of my students just learn at the academy. It\u2019s easier that way.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan hums back. He doesn\u2019t mention that he never really left his academy, either. Doesn\u2019t ask who trained Phil that way, and so successfully, if Dan\u2019s Master is to be trusted.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He sounds like he\u2019s smiling, but Dan doesn\u2019t turn to check.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They end up in a small town outside Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  The sandiness of the desert outside the city has sprouted small plants that dot the ground and a few small trees that surround the area. The houses are made of stone, with the same sloped roofs as they have in Ba Sing Se. Just next to the train, there\u2019s a man selling produce with a smile.\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to dip his head, to hide, as he steps off the train. The red of his fire nation clothing seems too obvious now, where everything blends in shades of green and brown.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMaster Phil,\u201d says the man. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were visiting.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  The man nods, grinning back, and presses a finger to his lips.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWho are we surprising?\u201d asks Dan where they\u2019re a few steps away and it doesn\u2019t feel so much like the blaze of his tunic is a burn on the earth tones of the town.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMy parents,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh.\u201d Dan glances around. There\u2019s an old woman sitting on a chair outside her house, and a little kid building a castle made of dirt. \u201cThey live here?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThey do.\u201d He turns to face Dan. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though, I didn\u2019t just bring you here for family dinner.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d he says again. \u201cDinner?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester are kind people, cloaked in green and wearing smiles. \n</p><p>\n  They draw Phil into a hug the moment he walks through the door, mumbling about how he should have told them he was coming, and especially that he was bringing company. Phil\u2019s dad smiles at Dan as his mum hugs him and it feels silly, to be standing in the doorway of a makeshift family reunion.\n</p><p>\n  And then Kath looks up at him, grins and says: \u201cOh, is this your new student?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s cheeks go the softest shade of pink. \u201cYeah, uh, this is Dan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s his first time in the Earth Kingdom.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBesides the last week in Ba Sing Se,\u201d says Dan. His teeth click together when he closes his mouth, and Phil puffs out a quiet laugh. \u201cI mean, uh, yeah. It\u2019s nice here. And nice to meet you guys, Mr. and Mrs. Lester.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  They both shake his hand. Dan realizes, only as they\u2019re pulling away, that he probably should have bowed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWould you guys like some tea or are you delving straight into training?\u201d asks Phil\u2019s mum.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think we\u2019ll do some training first,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI want to take him out to the\u2013 you know.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  She smiles. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil turns to him. His smile looks a lot like his mum\u2019s. \u201cIs that okay with you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Phil leads him out of the town, past some trees, to a clearing.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still see the houses from where they\u2019re standing. He can still tell where the train tracks cut across the landscape, where the man with the produce stand is probably still standing. The trees around them seem cut into a circle, perfectly cleared. The ground is almost perfectly flat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUh,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil walks to the center of the clearing, grins at Dan, and steps into a bending stance. He doesn\u2019t do anything fancy, or violent, or flashy. He just traces a circle in the earth around him, so thin it looks like he could be doing it with his fingertip.\n</p><p>\n  Dan realizes only then that, for his bending Master, he\u2019s hardly seen Phil bend at all.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s smiling when he looks up, the sun reflected in his eyes. \u201cThis is where I learned to bend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his mouth fall open. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, but it sounds more like a breath.\n</p><p>\n  The corners of Phil\u2019s eyes crinkle. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a blank canvas of sorts, where the village kids can learn without messing anything up in town,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents started teaching me when I was young. My brother has a little bit more of a temper than I do. He used to get so annoyed when I could control things more.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIs that why Master sent me to you?\u201d asks Dan. He hopes it sounds teasing. Phil seems to think it does.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBecause I could move rocks without getting mad when I was a kid?\u201d he says. \u201cProbably not. At least I hope not, or all those years of training afterwards were a big waste of time.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s pretty sure he sounds more sincere than he should when he says: \u201cThey definitely weren\u2019t.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smile softens. He steps aside, leaving the center of the circle to beckon Dan towards him. If his knees were more bent, his elbow a little straighter, a stone may come flying past Dan\u2019s head, into his palm. The thought makes Dan smile. \n</p><p>\n  He should ask Phil to bend in front of him sometime. He\u2019s always enjoyed watching Masters.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s toes scuff the ground as he steps into the middle. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cSo, uh, why are we here?\u201d he asks. \u201cScared I would burn the academy down?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he says. \u201cSit down.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does, folding his legs underneath him, crossing his hands over his lap. He wonders if Phil ever did the same, next to a brother, looking up at his parents and waiting for his earliest instructions on how to make the ground move. \n</p><p>\n  Next to him, Phil sits down too, so close that their knees bump together.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThe thing is, I can\u2019t really teach you how to bend the way I do my usual students, but earthbending and firebending are pretty similar,\u201d he says. \u201cYour Master sent you to me to improve your control over your bending. In my experience, the best way to do that is to ground yourself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His brows furrow. \u201cHow? I can\u2019t exactly feel the earth like you can.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d says Phil. \u201cBut you can focus on the world. Grounding yourself doesn\u2019t have to mean to the actual ground.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He reaches forward and rests a hand on Dan\u2019s knee, squeezing gently with a reassuring smile.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust do your breathing again, and focus on how things sound, how they feel. Trust me when I say it can help.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to ask how he knows, what he knows about Dan\u2019s trouble with controlling his fire, but Phil squeezes his knee again and stands before he can utter a word. He walks across the circle, until he\u2019s standing outside the perimeter he drew, and turns back to smile. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cGo ahead, breathe,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAre you going to watch me?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  If Dan were back home, he\u2019d hear the crackle of fire, feel the heaviness of humid heat on his skin.\n</p><p>\n  Here, he listens to the rustle of leaves through the trees, the distant squeals of children in the town. A train has come and gone since he sat down, and every now and then, he can hear Phil\u2019s footsteps, circling around him at a constant distance in a way that makes anxiety prickle along Dan\u2019s spine. \n</p><p>\n  He adjusts his hands on his thighs, sucks in another deep breath.\n</p><p>\n  The Earth Kingdom is hot, too, though it\u2019s more arid than the Fire Nation is. Dan\u2019s mouth can gone dry from the breaths he\u2019s taken. His palms are moist with sweat. When the wind picks up, specks of sand hit his face, just enough to make his skin sting.\n</p><p>\n  Part of him wants to move.\n</p><p>\n  He takes another deep breath, in through his nose, out through his mouth.\n</p><p>\n  His body feels heavy now, rooted to the ground. Even moving his hand to wipe the sweat from his palm feels like too much work. He\u2019s pretty sure his eyes will burn when he opens them, the desert sun still beating down on him as the afternoon drags on. \n</p><p>\n  A hand lands on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  He jumps. Phil\u2019s looking down at him, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFeel grounded?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan clenches his fist. His fingers feel almost numb, but steady. \u201cYeah, actually.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThen bend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tugs at the fabric of Dan\u2019s tunic, drawing him to his feet. \u201cBend,\u201d he repeats. \u201cSee how your control is now.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He steps away again, giving Dan a silent thumbs up from the sidelines as Dan adjusts his stance, lowering his center of balance, drawing his hands together in front of his chest. When he punches the air, a ball of flames erupts, flying forward until a pillar of stone rises to stop it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cKeep going!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  So Dan does it again, with an open palm this time, so a stream of fire bursts forth. He can control it this time, whipping it towards the ground and letting it fizzle out upon contact.\n</p><p>\n  He does the same with his right hand before kicking forward, making another ball of flames that Phil stops with his earthbending.\n</p><p>\n  The flames still burn brighter, more violently than he\u2019d want, but when Dan plants both feet on the ground again, no sparks fizzle at his fingertips.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat was great!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan turns on his heel. Phil\u2019s grinning, so wide and happy it has some of the rush fading. His breathing slows. He feels himself smile, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt helped,\u201d he says. \u201cIt actually helped.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They have soup for dinner.\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester tell stories of Phil\u2019s childhood. They talk about when they moved into the city for the sake of Phil\u2019s training, and about moving back after the academy had been set up. They ask about Dan\u2019s life back in the Fire Nation, about his family, his Master, and how he\u2019s liking the Earth Kingdom. \n</p><p>\n  Phil asks if they can come back next week, and his mum assures him that they most certainly can as she draws him into a goodbye hug.\n</p><p>\n  And then they get on the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s emptier this time, just a few people dotting seats. Dan sits by the window, head resting against the wall as Phil slides into the seat next to him. Their knees knock together, their shoulders bumping. Dan may be wrong, but he feels like they\u2019re closer this time.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWas that too much?\u201d asks Phil, once the train has drawn away and the town has faded into the blur.\n</p><p>\n  Dan looks over. His smile feels sleepy. \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI just realized I probably should have warned you before taking you to my parents\u2019 house.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Between them, Dan nudges their feet together, pressing himself closer to Phil. There\u2019s a strange urge to reach out, squeeze Phil\u2019s knee like he\u2019d done to Dan earlier, but he clenches his hand into a fist against his own thigh instead. It feels simpler that way.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt was fun,\u201d he says. \u201cTiring, but fun.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s responding smile is soft. \u201cYou should nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when we get there.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still pressed together when Dan drifts off to sleep.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  The next week follows the same routine.\n</p><p>\n  They practice breathing, have lunch, and practice breathing again. Dan watches Phil host classes for young earthbenders in the afternoons, kids who accidentally slam rocks into the walls and raise pillars to the ceiling. It almost makes Dan feel better about his own lack of control as he tries to muffle his laughs against his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It makes him understand why his Master sent him to Phil, as Dan watches him steady young teenagers.\n</p><p>\n  They play games at night. Some nights it\u2019s Pai Sho, on a board that once belonged to Phil\u2019s grandfather, with the clumsy strategy of two people who\u2019ve really learned how to play. Others, it\u2019s cards, arranged on the table between them as they sip tea and share stories.\n</p><p>\n  One night, Dan introduces Phil to gambling like they do in the Fire Nation, though Phil refuses to bet on anything more important than who pays for lunch the next day.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tells him about his aunt who tailors clothing and his grandma who claimed to be psychic. Dan tells him about his younger brother who can\u2019t bend but plays Kuai Ball better than Dan ever could and his nana who\u2019s always tried to teach him balance, though he never seemed to learn. \n</p><p>\n  On the weekend, they go back to Phil\u2019s parents\u2019, meditating in a clearing before eating soup around the dining table.\n</p><p>\n  They sit on the train back home together, pressed close and staring out the same window.\n</p><p>\n  At the end of the night, Dan\u2019s hand hovers over his doorknob as he whispers: \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The lights from outside allow him to see Phil\u2019s smile. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says, and then slips into his bedroom.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re going to try something different today.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s Monday morning, the sun high in the sky over Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think we need to work on your balance, too,\u201d says Phil. \u201cWatching you bend, you seem a little shaky. It could impact your control.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan picks at the belt tied around his waist. It\u2019s silly, he thinks, that he cheeks flush at the observation, as though he doesn\u2019t already know. When he was young, the force of bending would send him falling backwards sometimes, so he\u2019d scrape his palms and send his fire flying forward.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cProbably,\u201d he says. \u201cI can be, uh, kind of clumsy. I blame the growth spurt.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  A smile cracks across Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI can relate,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite clumsy myself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re literally the most steady earthbender I know,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s response is a laugh, quiet and happy and growing familiar. \u201cHow many earthbenders do you know?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUh.\u201d His cheeks get warmer. He can feel the morning sun hot against his right cheek, can see it gleaming in the corner of his vision. \u201cI\u2019ve met a bunch of kids.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSome of them are probably steadier than me,\u201d says Phil. \u201cIn everyday life, at least. I only have balance when bending. I learned to ground myself for it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGrounding has way too many definitions in earthbending.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile widens, even as he rolls his eyes. It makes Dan\u2019s chest go tight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust come here,\u201d says Phil\n</p><p>\n  Dan does.\n</p><p>\n  He ends up facing away from Phil, only a few inches between them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGet into your bending stance,\u201d says Phil. He\u2019s so close, it\u2019s barely a whisper against Dan\u2019s ear. \n</p><p>\n  He didn\u2019t mean to be this close. It feels like it\u2019d be weird to step away now. Dan\u2019s not even sure he wants to. Having Phil\u2019s voice so close, he realizes, isn\u2019t uncomfortable. \n</p><p>\n  Not in the way he would have expected, at least. \n</p><p>\n  He bends his knees, settling onto his heels, bringing his hands in front of his chest. Every move starts from here, he learned when he was just a kid. His power is centered here, in the press of his fist to his palm, the balance of his frame over the ground.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGood,\u201d says Phil. \n</p><p>\n  Dan bites his lip, ignoring the goosebumps that rise along his spine.\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil\u2019s hands settle on his hips. Dan has to swallow to keep from making a noise, has to focus to keep his hands from falling to his sides.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re tall,\u201d says Phil, like he doesn\u2019t notice a thing, \u201cSo you need to lower your center of balance more than most people.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He presses against Dan\u2019s hips, gently, lowering him ever so slightly.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIs that better?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you feel steadier?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. He doesn\u2019t feel steadier at all. Even his insides feel shaky now, his pulse stuttering where it thuds in his throat, his fingers quivering as he keeps them clenched in a fist. Phil\u2019s breath is still warm against the back of his neck, his hands still resting at Dan\u2019s sides, as though waiting to adjust him more, if needed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI, uh, I think so?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil draws back then. Dan counts enough footsteps to reach edge of the room. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cTry to bend, then,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan hesitates before shifting his weight, leaning back so he can kick his foot up and make a ball of flames fly through the air.\n</p><p>\n  He feels like he might fall over, like he did when he was little.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s not the fire\u2019s fault this time.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Phil buys lunch that day.\n</p><p>\n  They sit across from each other at a table in the corner of the room, with bowls of noodles and cups of tea. For the first time in a long time, they don\u2019t really talk.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still feel the phantom press of Phil\u2019s palms against his body.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to imagine it lasting longer.\n</p><p>\n  Under the table, their legs brush together. Over the edge of his cup, he can see Phil\u2019s cheeks go pink.\n</p><p>\n  He tries even harder not to wonder if Phil\u2019s thinking about it, too.\n</p><p>\n  They slip out of their seats at the same time, and fall into step on the walk between the restaurant and the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Their shoulders press together.\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn\u2019t pull away.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan says it on a Thursday night, when the sky has fallen so dark that their lazy game of cards is lit up only by the torch he lit earlier. He\u2019s curled up on his side on Phil\u2019s living room floor, splayed over cushions they dragged in from the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Phil throws a card into the space between them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  He fidgets with his own cards for a second, before resting a card with the earthbending emblem in its center down. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cHas it been weird, spending so much time with me suddenly?\u201d says Dan. \u201cI mean, you must have had a life before this.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, muffling it with a sip of his cherry-berry lemonade. \u201cDebatable.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. \u201cI just, didn\u2019t have much to do, I guess? I don\u2019t have many friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite the introvert, I guess.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. \u201cI, uh, same.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s next card has the airbending symbol on it. Dan\u2019s has fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I ask you something else?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil giggles. The firelight flickers across his cheekbones and makes the yellow flecks in his eyes stand out. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cHas it felt, I don\u2019t know, intrusive to have me here?\u201d says Dan. \u201cYou know, since you\u2019re an introvert.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He hums, and rests a card with another firebending emblem into the game. \u201cHonestly?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil looks up. He\u2019s smiling, soft and sweet, the kind reserved for quiet nights in, rather than the excitement of bending. His finger is tracing the edge of his playing cards, and though it\u2019s been days, Dan can still feel the foreign touch of Phil\u2019s hands on his hips.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think too hard about why.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI like it,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI feel like we, I don\u2019t know, work well together. It doesn\u2019t really feel like your a stranger, or even a student, in my house, you know?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He wonders if the tinge of pink on Phil\u2019s cheeks is a blush or from the orange of the fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cI know. It feels like we\u2019re \u2026 friends?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles wider. \u201cYeah, friends.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  That weekend, they stand in the clearing outside Phil\u2019s hometown again.\n</p><p>\n  Dan watches the last of his flames die out, crashing against a pillar Phil makes rise and fall in the span of a minute. He\u2019s lunging forward, palm splayed wide, thrust in front of him. His chest is heaving. He\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s the longest stretch he\u2019s bent for.\n</p><p>\n  The longest he\u2019s gone without losing control.\n</p><p>\n  He settles back, standing up straight, watching the sand blow in the wind before him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re doing really well,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can hear his smile before he sees it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThanks to you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s a rush of earth as Phil smoothes out the circle he\u2019s redrawn on the ground. By this point in his training, Dan\u2019s supposed to try to kill his fire before it reaches outside the boundary, and he usually manages.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat was all you, mate,\u201d says Phil. He reaches the middle of the circle, bumping their shoulders together. \u201cAt this rate, you\u2019ll be ready to go back to the Fire Nation soon.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows around a bittersweet rush in his chest at the thought.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  They start walking towards the town, shoulders still standing side by side. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re having dinner with your parents again, right?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil grins. \u201cWe are. But, fair warning, if it\u2019s not great it\u2019s because my mum is trying to follow a Fire Nation recipe tonight,\u201d he says. He looks up at Dan, their arms brushing, his face so very close. \u201cShe said she wanted to do something to remind you of home, since you\u2019ve been here so long.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his face flush as he mumbles: \u201cOh.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The responding laugh is pressed against his shoulder, and sounds almost like a giggle. It makes Dan\u2019s cheeks go even hotter.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThanks for the warning,\u201d he says, because he can\u2019t think of anything else. \u201cNow I can figure out how to thank her before she tells me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They go home that night with leftover bread.\n</p><p>\n  Mrs. Lester hugged them both goodbye, whispering to Dan that she hoped her rice wasn\u2019t too different from what they serve in the Fire Nation. Mr. Lester had shaken his hand with a kind smile. They\u2019d shoved a bag into Phil\u2019s arms and sent them to catch the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s another quiet ride, pressed together, watching the now-familiar desert landscape.\n</p><p>\n  When they get home, Dan whispers: \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile is crooked, warm even in the darkness, as he says it too.\n</p><p>\n  Dan slips into his bed, tucking himself under his blankets, and wonders when he started thinking about Phil\u2019s house as home.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He wakes up with a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It takes him a moment to realize Phil\u2019s shaking him, saying his name over and over by his ear. And another beat too long to process the crackling of fire sounding loud, too close to his ear.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s sitting up. Phil\u2019s dragging him out of his bed, away from the drapes that Dan apparently lit on fire. In his sleep.\n</p><p>\n  \u201c\n  <i>\n    Fuck.\n  </i>\n  \u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil waves a hand. From the stone walls rise a little bubble of earth. Dan realizes only when Phil returns the room to normal that it choked out the fire on the now-charred curtains.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck,\u201d Dan says again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought that stopped happening.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s another tug at his shoulder. Phil\u2019s still clutching at his sleep shirt, still trying to pull him away from his bed, away from where the flames had blazed. Phil\u2019s hair, Dan realizes, is a mess atop his head. His eyes are too wide, a little unfocused. The fire must have woken him up.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stumbles to his feet, because Phil obviously wants him too.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t expect Phil to wrap his arms around him, hold him close.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou scared me,\u201d he says, the words muffled against Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you sleep firebend?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened in a while,\u201d Dan hears himself say. It must be the shock that has him being so honest. Or maybe it\u2019s the way Phil\u2019s pressed against him. \u201cI\u2013 we were working on my control back in the Fire Nation and that, at least, had gone away. I thought it was safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil squeezes him even tighter. \u201cYou are safe,\u201d he mumbles.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s pretty sure Phil\u2019s trying to reassure himself.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They curl up together in Phil\u2019s bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan almost protested. Only the drapes were burned, after all. The bed\u2019s fine. But Phil\u2019s still clinging to him, and Dan likes the warm press of someone against his chest.\n</p><p>\n  Of \n  <i>\n    Phil \n  </i>\n  against his chest. \n</p><p>\n  The sky\u2019s started to swirl in shades of pink outside. It must be bleeding into morning, the time when they\u2019d drag themselves out of bed to have breakfast before doing breathing exercises in the academy. This is comfier, though. It\u2019s better.\n</p><p>\n  It feels like Phil\u2019s practicing breathing exercises to stay calm. \n</p><p>\n  So Dan slides his hand into Phil\u2019s hair.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m okay, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cYou put out the fire and it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, pressing himself tighter against Dan\u2019s chest as though the louder echo of his heartbeat is reassuring. Maybe it is. Dan\u2019s fingers, now rubbing gentle circles against the back of Phil\u2019s head, seem to be. Some of the tension bleeds from Phil\u2019s shoulders.\n</p><p>\n  It feels less like a panicked hug, suddenly. More like cuddling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles at the ceiling. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou know how I asked if you had anxiety when we first met?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d whispers Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s fingers drift up along Dan\u2019s side, gentle, almost shy. They\u2019ve only ever really touched during lessons, haphazard adjustments of Dan\u2019s stance, of his breathing. This isn\u2019t that. Dan knows it isn\u2019t that when Phil\u2019s hand presses flat against the splay of his ribs as though to feel the rise and fall of his breathing.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI used to have anxiety,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI was terrified of the city, didn\u2019t talk to people much. It\u2019s part of why I\u2019m so good at teaching control. I had to, you know, relearn it for my own bending.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s hand clenches against the back of Phil\u2019s head. It must be comforting, because Phil hums, nestling even closer to him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOne of my friends died,\u201d he continues. \u201cIn a bending accident. Freak thing, but I was so scared.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dan whispers. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He tilts his head up, still pressed against Dan\u2019s shoulder, still so very close. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI just wanted you to know,\u201d says Phil. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2013 you scared me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay.\u201d Dan reaches up with his free hand, resting it on top of Phil\u2019s. \u201cYou can be scared. You don\u2019t always need to be in control, you know.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Half a smile quirks at the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s enough.\n</p><p>\n  Dan keeps holding him.\n</p><p>\n  And that\u2019s enough, too.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  It takes a few days for them to recover. \n</p><p>\n  They don\u2019t practice bending during those days. There\u2019s breathing exercises for a little while, and then just life. Phil takes Dan shopping the first day, to some of the nicer stores in Ba Sing Se, and then to lunch at a restaurant he loves but rarely goes to.\n</p><p>\n  He buys new drapes that day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan still doesn\u2019t sleep in his own bed.\n</p><p>\n  But when he curls up against Phil\u2019s back at night, he doesn\u2019t care to complain.\n</p><p>\n  Phil still teaches his classes in the afternoon, going through rudimentary earthbending while Dan sits in the corner and watches, not bothering to hide his smile.\n</p><p>\n  They play Pai Sho in the evenings.\n</p><p>\n  And on Thursday, when they go to bed, Dan doesn\u2019t question it when Phil leads him to his bedroom, so they can curl up side by side again. \n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you know what you were dreaming about? That night?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan cracks one eye open. They\u2019re supposed to be breathing, balancing on one leg, but Phil\u2019s standing in front of him with a curious furrow to his brow, both feet flat on the ground.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThe night of the fire?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNot really. I didn\u2019t even remember that day, to be honest,\u201d says Dan. He lets himself stand normally again, and stops the rhythmic counting of his breaths. \u201cI was thinking about going back to the Fire Nation when I fell asleep though, so maybe that.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It feels wrong to admit. His cheeks go warm. Phil\u2019s brows furrow further.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you not want to go back?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, really. I like it there. I just\u2013\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust what?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He feels himself smile, watching Phil mirror it. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI just like it here, a lot. Uh, with you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile goes brighter. It seems to shine in his eyes. Dan feels it, hot and fluttery, in his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI like you here, too.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They go back to the clearing on Sunday.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s the first time Dan\u2019s actually firebent since the incident, in a desert without drapes or duvets to light aflame. He\u2019s almost surprised to find his control hasn\u2019t dimmed. He can still stop his flames before they reach the perimeter, can still keep them from blazing too bright.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t bother to erase the circle before stepping towards Dan this time. His hands land on Dan\u2019s shoulders, rubbing gently at the muscle there.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re less tense,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re breathing well. And you\u2019re in tune with nature more. You\u2019re doing \u2026 good.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan grins. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s response is a smile. He looks up, his eyes bright, gleaming in the desert sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His hands are still on Dan\u2019s shoulders, holding on too tightly. For a moment, it looks like he might cry. Dan blinks against the realization that he might, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhy does it feel like you\u2019re saying goodbye?\u201d he whispers.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI could be?\u201d says Phil, voice shaky. \u201cYou could go back now, finish your training with your Master. You have control.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t let go. Dan reaches for him, just in case. His heart is racing, aching.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to say goodbye?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles at that, soft and hopeful. \u201cThen can I do something?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles back. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The hand on his left shoulder drifts, cradling the back of his neck so Phil can draw him forward. Their smiles meet. Dan\u2019s eyes drift closed.\n</p><p>\n  And they\u2019re kissing.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  The train back home is almost empty that night.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s head is resting against his shoulder, his hand on Dan\u2019s forearm. They don\u2019t look out the window. Dan\u2019s too busy wondering if he should hold Phil\u2019s hand, if that\u2019s something they do now that they\u2019ve kissed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI was thinking,\u201d says Phil, \u201cThat maybe you don\u2019t have to go back to the Fire Nation right away?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cYou could stay with me. The war\u2019s over, there\u2019s firebending Masters in Ba Sing Se. I know it\u2019s not your Master, but you could try to finish your training,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we could set up your old room to be a guest room. I know it\u2019s a long trip, but if your family wanted to visit, they could stay in there.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his head. Dan turns to catch how blue his eyes look in the low light of the night train.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUnless you\u2019d want it back, of course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan chuckles. Without looking away, he slips his hand into Phil\u2019s. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it back.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s teeth catch at his lip when he smiles. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you\u2019ll stay? At least for a little while?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s Dan that leans down to kiss him this time.\n</p><p>\n  And it\u2019s him who pulls away to mumble: \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t want the day to end when they get home. Neither does Phil, apparently, as he suggests they have tea before bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan warms the kettle with his firebending, standing in the middle of Phil\u2019s house of stone. They sip tea on the sofa without any games to play, without any distractions.\n</p><p>\n  And when they slip into bed, curled up under a dark sky and Poe the potted plant, now resting on Phil\u2019s windowsill, they kiss goodnight.\n</p>",

He tugs his hood over his head, pressing his face against the wall of the train. His knee bounces. His fingertips burn. He curls his hands into fists and sucks in a steady breath to keep from singing the sleeves of his tunic with his bare hands.\n</p><p>\n  He shouldn\u2019t be thinking such things. Before him lies a city that he knows fought valiantly, built itself back up after the war into something beautiful. It\u2019s full of sloped green and yellow roofs and plants blooming in the summer heat, and Dan just wishes he was back home, where walls were made of dark metal and the air seemed to shimmer with sparks.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019d never been to the Earth Kingdom. Though the war had ended and the four Nations now lived in peace as a single, United Republic, travel was still arduous, and Dan had never been particularly adventurous.\n</p><p>\n  In front of him, a child is running up and down the aisle. Across from him, a man is reading a book, glasses perched now on his nose. Next to him, the seat is empty.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swipes his fringe across his forehead and tries not to think too much about why.\n</p><p>\n  The train shudders to a stop eventually. The people of the Earth Kingdom seem to stand in unison, and Dan feels clumsy on his feet when he shoots up a second later. He stumbles down the steps.\n</p><p>\n  The ground here is sandy. He tries not to miss the stone from back home.\n</p><p>\n  He glances down at the map he was given, following its path through the city, past a shop that smells of Jasmine and another with pottery on display. It\u2019s not far from the train stop, the building with the Earth Kingdom symbol above it\u2019s door. \n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Master Phil\u2019s Earthbending Academy, \n  </i>\n  is written on the sign.\n</p><p>\n  Dan pushes the door open. A bell chimes above his head. A man with black hair and a beige shirt is standing there.\n</p><p>\n  He smiles. \u201cDan, right?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan can do nothing but nod.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re firebending Master speaks highly of you,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  They\u2019re sitting in a back room then, on cushions of plush green fabric. Dan\u2019s fingers dig into his knees so he doesn\u2019t fidget, so he doesn\u2019t risk fire sizzling from his palms.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m quite powerful,\u201d he says. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cAs have I,\u201d says Phil. Dan\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s talking about Dan or about himself. He doesn\u2019t bother to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s control you lack, correct?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He nods. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile quirks at just one corner of his mouth. \u201cI can help you with that,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Phil stands slowly, steadily, and picks up the cushion he\u2019d been kneeling on to toss it aside. Dan would laugh at it hitting the wall and falling atop a pot Dan\u2019s fairly certain Phil hadn\u2019t meant to touch, but he\u2019d been told by his Master that Phil was someone to respect.\n</p><p>\n  Master Lester, they\u2019d called him back home, but Phil\u2019s never mentioned his last name or his title.\n</p><p>\n  He looks back at Dan, a hint of laughter in his eyes. \u201cYou can stand, too,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, it would probably be better if you stood.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He grabs his cushion, too, and sets it aside more gently than Phil had, so the floor is empty. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019d like you to show me your firebending,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stomach sinks. He glances at the curtains open over windows and banners hanging from the ceiling, and tries not to think about the things he\u2019s accidentally lit aflame back home, in a kingdom built for his element. Here, he thinks, he could burn far too much.\n</p><p>\n  Phil must notice his frown. \u201cYou can stop it, can\u2019t you?\u201d he asks. And then, as though to prove his point, he opens his palm over the ground and raises a column of earth next to him, stopping at the perfect height to perch his arm on.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course I can stop it,\u201d hisses Dan. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil jerks his head to the side, still smiling. \u201cWell then, go ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He punches forward so a burst of flames flies towards a bare part of the wall. And again just for the sake of it. His open palm makes a stream of fire shoot forward, and a practiced flick of his wrist sends it whipping towards the ceiling. A spinning kick has a ring of fire forming at his feet, expanding until\u2013\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay, stop!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s pressed against the wall then. His column of earth has disappeared, his smile faded. Dan collapses forward, unsteady on his feet. A last burst of fire explodes from his fingertips, but he manages to stop it before it hits a drape hanging on the far wall.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, breath coming too quick.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Phil pushes himself off the wall, and side eyes a faint dark spot on one of his banners, where the fabric\u2019s been singed black. \n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his cheeks burn. He curls his hands into fists to keep the embarrassment from forming fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSorry,\u201d he repeats.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cReally, it\u2019s alright,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI agreed to help train you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to feel small when he mumbles: \u201cAnd?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Another lopsided smile quirks at the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth. \u201cAnd I think I can,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s set Dan up a room in his house.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s small, with a narrow bed wedged into the corner and little plants resting on the sill of a window looking over an alleyway. Phil\u2019s leaning against the door as Dan drops his bag, haphazardly stuffed full of Fire Nation clothing, by the foot of the bed. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI know it\u2019s not much,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles. \u201cI appreciate the hospitality.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He goes to bow, but Phil waves a hand before he can. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t burn Poe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cPoe?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  A hint of laughter gleams in Phil\u2019s eyes. He motions over Dan\u2019s shoulder, towards the window. \u201cThe little plant,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s special to me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. He makes a mental note to always tuck his hand nearest the wall under his duvet before falling asleep, lest his dreams make him firebend. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d says Phil. He pushes himself off the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s tea in the kitchen if you\u2019d like any before bed. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t need any help heating it up?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels himself grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine, sir.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, just once. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says, before turning around, walking away with slow, steady steps.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with breathing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s standing in the middle of the room when he says it, holding pebbles he picked up off the floor in his hand. He sucks in a deep breath, and sends one flying across the room into the furthest pot he has. Then the second, into a flowerpot he has by the door. And the third, which lands at Dan\u2019s feet. \n</p><p>\n  Dan wonders, for a moment, if it\u2019s supposed to be intimidating, but Phil just looks amused.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m bad at breathing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil flicks his hand, and the stone at Dan\u2019s feet flies back into his palm. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important for firebending, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. \u201cIt is, yes.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThen you\u2019ll need to learn it,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He walks across the room, picks up one the cushions they sat on yesterday, and tosses it towards Dan. His aim\u2019s off, so it lands a few feet away with a quiet thud. Dan walks over to get it, returning it to his spot in the middle of the room, Phil watching him the whole time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits, legs crossed like they do back home.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you expect me to breathe evenly while you stare?\u201d he asks, perhaps a little more rude than his Master back home would permit.\n</p><p>\n  Phil just grins, and picks up a second cushion. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to breathe with you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They do nothing but breathe for the first day. \n</p><p>\n  Afterwards, Phil takes Dan out into the city, to a restaurant he likes to eat at when, in his own words, he\u2019s too lazy to cook. They eat more vegetables in the Earth Kingdom, Dan notices, as he watches Phil stuff a dumpling into his mouth, grinning as he watches Dan sip his tea.\n</p><p>\n  The second day, they breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  For lunch, Phil makes soup on a fire he trusts Dan to maintain, reminding him to breathe every time the flames burn too bright. Dan\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s a little overcooked by the end, and some of the broth boiled over the edge of the pot, but Phil doesn\u2019t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  The third day, they breathe \n  <i>\n    again. \n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Dan rests his hands on his knees and tries to count his breaths, slow counts of four and eight as he listens to the quiet puffs of Phil\u2019s from across the room. He fidgets. He knows he does, his feet going tingly numb and his shoulders aching from sitting up straight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cStay still,\u201d Phil says from across the room. \n</p><p>\n  When Dan opens his eyes, Phil\u2019s are still closed. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI can feel the earth moving,\u201d he says, like he knows Dan is staring.\n</p><p>\n  Dan lets his eyes fall closed and tries to breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  The fourth day, Phil\u2019s footsteps interrupt the silence.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s moved before calling for a break. Dan feels his chest go tight, his shoulders tense. He hears the hitch of his own breath, and the stilling of Phil\u2019s steps in response.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBreathe,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He counts to four in his head, lips moving around silent words, before sucking in another breath. Phil\u2019s footsteps echo in the room again, quiet, slow. Dan tries not to focus on the anxiety prickling at his spine.\n</p><p>\n  He wonders if it\u2019s his imagination, or if Phil\u2019s really staring at him so intently.\n</p><p>\n  The footsteps stop. Dan\u2019s breath hitches mid-exhale. There\u2019s a rustle of fabric behind him, and then a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re still tense,\u201d says Phil. He\u2019s so close, suddenly, that Dan can feel a rush of warm breath against his ear. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, holding his breath for a count of eight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you get anxious?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. \u201cYou know I do. My Master must have told you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cHe did,\u201d he admits. \u201cI wanted to hear it from you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn\u2019t ask why. He squeezes his eyes closed against the burn there, feeling his ribs shudder around another breath. The hand on his shoulder drifts down along his spine, slow and gentle, before settling on his side, splayed across his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou breathe in your chest,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIsn\u2019t that where your lungs are?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He laughs, still so close Dan can feel it. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you should breathe lower, deeper. It\u2019s more centering.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil draws away, stands up, and walks across the room, back to his own cushion.\n</p><p>\n  If he notices the shakiness in Dan\u2019s breathing, he doesn\u2019t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They leave the city on the seventh day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits on a train just like the one he arrived on, watching the city grow smaller, sparcer, until they pass the wall and it seems to disappear altogether. Phil\u2019s sitting next to him, leaning forward so they can look out the same window, their legs pressed together between their seats.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cLeft the city?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cI used to do it all the time when I was in training,\u201d he says. \u201cBut most of my students just learn at the academy. It\u2019s easier that way.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan hums back. He doesn\u2019t mention that he never really left his academy, either. Doesn\u2019t ask who trained Phil that way, and so successfully, if Dan\u2019s Master is to be trusted.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He sounds like he\u2019s smiling, but Dan doesn\u2019t turn to check.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They end up in a small town outside Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  The sandiness of the desert outside the city has sprouted small plants that dot the ground and a few small trees that surround the area. The houses are made of stone, with the same sloped roofs as they have in Ba Sing Se. Just next to the train, there\u2019s a man selling produce with a smile.\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to dip his head, to hide, as he steps off the train. The red of his fire nation clothing seems too obvious now, where everything blends in shades of green and brown.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMaster Phil,\u201d says the man. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were visiting.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  The man nods, grinning back, and presses a finger to his lips.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWho are we surprising?\u201d asks Dan where they\u2019re a few steps away and it doesn\u2019t feel so much like the blaze of his tunic is a burn on the earth tones of the town.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMy parents,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh.\u201d Dan glances around. There\u2019s an old woman sitting on a chair outside her house, and a little kid building a castle made of dirt. \u201cThey live here?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThey do.\u201d He turns to face Dan. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though, I didn\u2019t just bring you here for family dinner.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d he says again. \u201cDinner?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester are kind people, cloaked in green and wearing smiles. \n</p><p>\n  They draw Phil into a hug the moment he walks through the door, mumbling about how he should have told them he was coming, and especially that he was bringing company. Phil\u2019s dad smiles at Dan as his mum hugs him and it feels silly, to be standing in the doorway of a makeshift family reunion.\n</p><p>\n  And then Kath looks up at him, grins and says: \u201cOh, is this your new student?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s cheeks go the softest shade of pink. \u201cYeah, uh, this is Dan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s his first time in the Earth Kingdom.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBesides the last week in Ba Sing Se,\u201d says Dan. His teeth click together when he closes his mouth, and Phil puffs out a quiet laugh. \u201cI mean, uh, yeah. It\u2019s nice here. And nice to meet you guys, Mr. and Mrs. Lester.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  They both shake his hand. Dan realizes, only as they\u2019re pulling away, that he probably should have bowed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWould you guys like some tea or are you delving straight into training?\u201d asks Phil\u2019s mum.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think we\u2019ll do some training first,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI want to take him out to the\u2013 you know.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  She smiles. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil turns to him. His smile looks a lot like his mum\u2019s. \u201cIs that okay with you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Phil leads him out of the town, past some trees, to a clearing.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still see the houses from where they\u2019re standing. He can still tell where the train tracks cut across the landscape, where the man with the produce stand is probably still standing. The trees around them seem cut into a circle, perfectly cleared. The ground is almost perfectly flat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUh,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil walks to the center of the clearing, grins at Dan, and steps into a bending stance. He doesn\u2019t do anything fancy, or violent, or flashy. He just traces a circle in the earth around him, so thin it looks like he could be doing it with his fingertip.\n</p><p>\n  Dan realizes only then that, for his bending Master, he\u2019s hardly seen Phil bend at all.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s smiling when he looks up, the sun reflected in his eyes. \u201cThis is where I learned to bend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his mouth fall open. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, but it sounds more like a breath.\n</p><p>\n  The corners of Phil\u2019s eyes crinkle. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a blank canvas of sorts, where the village kids can learn without messing anything up in town,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents started teaching me when I was young. My brother has a little bit more of a temper than I do. He used to get so annoyed when I could control things more.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIs that why Master sent me to you?\u201d asks Dan. He hopes it sounds teasing. Phil seems to think it does.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBecause I could move rocks without getting mad when I was a kid?\u201d he says. \u201cProbably not. At least I hope not, or all those years of training afterwards were a big waste of time.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s pretty sure he sounds more sincere than he should when he says: \u201cThey definitely weren\u2019t.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smile softens. He steps aside, leaving the center of the circle to beckon Dan towards him. If his knees were more bent, his elbow a little straighter, a stone may come flying past Dan\u2019s head, into his palm. The thought makes Dan smile. \n</p><p>\n  He should ask Phil to bend in front of him sometime. He\u2019s always enjoyed watching Masters.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s toes scuff the ground as he steps into the middle. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cSo, uh, why are we here?\u201d he asks. \u201cScared I would burn the academy down?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he says. \u201cSit down.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does, folding his legs underneath him, crossing his hands over his lap. He wonders if Phil ever did the same, next to a brother, looking up at his parents and waiting for his earliest instructions on how to make the ground move. \n</p><p>\n  Next to him, Phil sits down too, so close that their knees bump together.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThe thing is, I can\u2019t really teach you how to bend the way I do my usual students, but earthbending and firebending are pretty similar,\u201d he says. \u201cYour Master sent you to me to improve your control over your bending. In my experience, the best way to do that is to ground yourself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His brows furrow. \u201cHow? I can\u2019t exactly feel the earth like you can.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d says Phil. \u201cBut you can focus on the world. Grounding yourself doesn\u2019t have to mean to the actual ground.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He reaches forward and rests a hand on Dan\u2019s knee, squeezing gently with a reassuring smile.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust do your breathing again, and focus on how things sound, how they feel. Trust me when I say it can help.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to ask how he knows, what he knows about Dan\u2019s trouble with controlling his fire, but Phil squeezes his knee again and stands before he can utter a word. He walks across the circle, until he\u2019s standing outside the perimeter he drew, and turns back to smile. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cGo ahead, breathe,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAre you going to watch me?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  If Dan were back home, he\u2019d hear the crackle of fire, feel the heaviness of humid heat on his skin.\n</p><p>\n  Here, he listens to the rustle of leaves through the trees, the distant squeals of children in the town. A train has come and gone since he sat down, and every now and then, he can hear Phil\u2019s footsteps, circling around him at a constant distance in a way that makes anxiety prickle along Dan\u2019s spine. \n</p><p>\n  He adjusts his hands on his thighs, sucks in another deep breath.\n</p><p>\n  The Earth Kingdom is hot, too, though it\u2019s more arid than the Fire Nation is. Dan\u2019s mouth can gone dry from the breaths he\u2019s taken. His palms are moist with sweat. When the wind picks up, specks of sand hit his face, just enough to make his skin sting.\n</p><p>\n  Part of him wants to move.\n</p><p>\n  He takes another deep breath, in through his nose, out through his mouth.\n</p><p>\n  His body feels heavy now, rooted to the ground. Even moving his hand to wipe the sweat from his palm feels like too much work. He\u2019s pretty sure his eyes will burn when he opens them, the desert sun still beating down on him as the afternoon drags on. \n</p><p>\n  A hand lands on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  He jumps. Phil\u2019s looking down at him, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFeel grounded?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan clenches his fist. His fingers feel almost numb, but steady. \u201cYeah, actually.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThen bend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tugs at the fabric of Dan\u2019s tunic, drawing him to his feet. \u201cBend,\u201d he repeats. \u201cSee how your control is now.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He steps away again, giving Dan a silent thumbs up from the sidelines as Dan adjusts his stance, lowering his center of balance, drawing his hands together in front of his chest. When he punches the air, a ball of flames erupts, flying forward until a pillar of stone rises to stop it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cKeep going!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  So Dan does it again, with an open palm this time, so a stream of fire bursts forth. He can control it this time, whipping it towards the ground and letting it fizzle out upon contact.\n</p><p>\n  He does the same with his right hand before kicking forward, making another ball of flames that Phil stops with his earthbending.\n</p><p>\n  The flames still burn brighter, more violently than he\u2019d want, but when Dan plants both feet on the ground again, no sparks fizzle at his fingertips.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat was great!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan turns on his heel. Phil\u2019s grinning, so wide and happy it has some of the rush fading. His breathing slows. He feels himself smile, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt helped,\u201d he says. \u201cIt actually helped.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They have soup for dinner.\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester tell stories of Phil\u2019s childhood. They talk about when they moved into the city for the sake of Phil\u2019s training, and about moving back after the academy had been set up. They ask about Dan\u2019s life back in the Fire Nation, about his family, his Master, and how he\u2019s liking the Earth Kingdom. \n</p><p>\n  Phil asks if they can come back next week, and his mum assures him that they most certainly can as she draws him into a goodbye hug.\n</p><p>\n  And then they get on the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s emptier this time, just a few people dotting seats. Dan sits by the window, head resting against the wall as Phil slides into the seat next to him. Their knees knock together, their shoulders bumping. Dan may be wrong, but he feels like they\u2019re closer this time.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWas that too much?\u201d asks Phil, once the train has drawn away and the town has faded into the blur.\n</p><p>\n  Dan looks over. His smile feels sleepy. \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI just realized I probably should have warned you before taking you to my parents\u2019 house.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Between them, Dan nudges their feet together, pressing himself closer to Phil. There\u2019s a strange urge to reach out, squeeze Phil\u2019s knee like he\u2019d done to Dan earlier, but he clenches his hand into a fist against his own thigh instead. It feels simpler that way.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt was fun,\u201d he says. \u201cTiring, but fun.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s responding smile is soft. \u201cYou should nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when we get there.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still pressed together when Dan drifts off to sleep.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  The next week follows the same routine.\n</p><p>\n  They practice breathing, have lunch, and practice breathing again. Dan watches Phil host classes for young earthbenders in the afternoons, kids who accidentally slam rocks into the walls and raise pillars to the ceiling. It almost makes Dan feel better about his own lack of control as he tries to muffle his laughs against his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It makes him understand why his Master sent him to Phil, as Dan watches him steady young teenagers.\n</p><p>\n  They play games at night. Some nights it\u2019s Pai Sho, on a board that once belonged to Phil\u2019s grandfather, with the clumsy strategy of two people who\u2019ve really learned how to play. Others, it\u2019s cards, arranged on the table between them as they sip tea and share stories.\n</p><p>\n  One night, Dan introduces Phil to gambling like they do in the Fire Nation, though Phil refuses to bet on anything more important than who pays for lunch the next day.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tells him about his aunt who tailors clothing and his grandma who claimed to be psychic. Dan tells him about his younger brother who can\u2019t bend but plays Kuai Ball better than Dan ever could and his nana who\u2019s always tried to teach him balance, though he never seemed to learn. \n</p><p>\n  On the weekend, they go back to Phil\u2019s parents\u2019, meditating in a clearing before eating soup around the dining table.\n</p><p>\n  They sit on the train back home together, pressed close and staring out the same window.\n</p><p>\n  At the end of the night, Dan\u2019s hand hovers over his doorknob as he whispers: \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The lights from outside allow him to see Phil\u2019s smile. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says, and then slips into his bedroom.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re going to try something different today.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s Monday morning, the sun high in the sky over Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think we need to work on your balance, too,\u201d says Phil. \u201cWatching you bend, you seem a little shaky. It could impact your control.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan picks at the belt tied around his waist. It\u2019s silly, he thinks, that he cheeks flush at the observation, as though he doesn\u2019t already know. When he was young, the force of bending would send him falling backwards sometimes, so he\u2019d scrape his palms and send his fire flying forward.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cProbably,\u201d he says. \u201cI can be, uh, kind of clumsy. I blame the growth spurt.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  A smile cracks across Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI can relate,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite clumsy myself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re literally the most steady earthbender I know,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s response is a laugh, quiet and happy and growing familiar. \u201cHow many earthbenders do you know?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUh.\u201d His cheeks get warmer. He can feel the morning sun hot against his right cheek, can see it gleaming in the corner of his vision. \u201cI\u2019ve met a bunch of kids.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSome of them are probably steadier than me,\u201d says Phil. \u201cIn everyday life, at least. I only have balance when bending. I learned to ground myself for it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGrounding has way too many definitions in earthbending.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile widens, even as he rolls his eyes. It makes Dan\u2019s chest go tight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust come here,\u201d says Phil\n</p><p>\n  Dan does.\n</p><p>\n  He ends up facing away from Phil, only a few inches between them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGet into your bending stance,\u201d says Phil. He\u2019s so close, it\u2019s barely a whisper against Dan\u2019s ear. \n</p><p>\n  He didn\u2019t mean to be this close. It feels like it\u2019d be weird to step away now. Dan\u2019s not even sure he wants to. Having Phil\u2019s voice so close, he realizes, isn\u2019t uncomfortable. \n</p><p>\n  Not in the way he would have expected, at least. \n</p><p>\n  He bends his knees, settling onto his heels, bringing his hands in front of his chest. Every move starts from here, he learned when he was just a kid. His power is centered here, in the press of his fist to his palm, the balance of his frame over the ground.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGood,\u201d says Phil. \n</p><p>\n  Dan bites his lip, ignoring the goosebumps that rise along his spine.\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil\u2019s hands settle on his hips. Dan has to swallow to keep from making a noise, has to focus to keep his hands from falling to his sides.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re tall,\u201d says Phil, like he doesn\u2019t notice a thing, \u201cSo you need to lower your center of balance more than most people.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He presses against Dan\u2019s hips, gently, lowering him ever so slightly.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIs that better?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you feel steadier?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. He doesn\u2019t feel steadier at all. Even his insides feel shaky now, his pulse stuttering where it thuds in his throat, his fingers quivering as he keeps them clenched in a fist. Phil\u2019s breath is still warm against the back of his neck, his hands still resting at Dan\u2019s sides, as though waiting to adjust him more, if needed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI, uh, I think so?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil draws back then. Dan counts enough footsteps to reach edge of the room. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cTry to bend, then,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan hesitates before shifting his weight, leaning back so he can kick his foot up and make a ball of flames fly through the air.\n</p><p>\n  He feels like he might fall over, like he did when he was little.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s not the fire\u2019s fault this time.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Phil buys lunch that day.\n</p><p>\n  They sit across from each other at a table in the corner of the room, with bowls of noodles and cups of tea. For the first time in a long time, they don\u2019t really talk.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still feel the phantom press of Phil\u2019s palms against his body.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to imagine it lasting longer.\n</p><p>\n  Under the table, their legs brush together. Over the edge of his cup, he can see Phil\u2019s cheeks go pink.\n</p><p>\n  He tries even harder not to wonder if Phil\u2019s thinking about it, too.\n</p><p>\n  They slip out of their seats at the same time, and fall into step on the walk between the restaurant and the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Their shoulders press together.\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn\u2019t pull away.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan says it on a Thursday night, when the sky has fallen so dark that their lazy game of cards is lit up only by the torch he lit earlier. He\u2019s curled up on his side on Phil\u2019s living room floor, splayed over cushions they dragged in from the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Phil throws a card into the space between them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  He fidgets with his own cards for a second, before resting a card with the earthbending emblem in its center down. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cHas it been weird, spending so much time with me suddenly?\u201d says Dan. \u201cI mean, you must have had a life before this.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, muffling it with a sip of his cherry-berry lemonade. \u201cDebatable.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. \u201cI just, didn\u2019t have much to do, I guess? I don\u2019t have many friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite the introvert, I guess.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. \u201cI, uh, same.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s next card has the airbending symbol on it. Dan\u2019s has fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I ask you something else?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil giggles. The firelight flickers across his cheekbones and makes the yellow flecks in his eyes stand out. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cHas it felt, I don\u2019t know, intrusive to have me here?\u201d says Dan. \u201cYou know, since you\u2019re an introvert.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He hums, and rests a card with another firebending emblem into the game. \u201cHonestly?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil looks up. He\u2019s smiling, soft and sweet, the kind reserved for quiet nights in, rather than the excitement of bending. His finger is tracing the edge of his playing cards, and though it\u2019s been days, Dan can still feel the foreign touch of Phil\u2019s hands on his hips.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think too hard about why.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI like it,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI feel like we, I don\u2019t know, work well together. It doesn\u2019t really feel like your a stranger, or even a student, in my house, you know?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He wonders if the tinge of pink on Phil\u2019s cheeks is a blush or from the orange of the fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cI know. It feels like we\u2019re \u2026 friends?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles wider. \u201cYeah, friends.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  That weekend, they stand in the clearing outside Phil\u2019s hometown again.\n</p><p>\n  Dan watches the last of his flames die out, crashing against a pillar Phil makes rise and fall in the span of a minute. He\u2019s lunging forward, palm splayed wide, thrust in front of him. His chest is heaving. He\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s the longest stretch he\u2019s bent for.\n</p><p>\n  The longest he\u2019s gone without losing control.\n</p><p>\n  He settles back, standing up straight, watching the sand blow in the wind before him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re doing really well,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can hear his smile before he sees it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThanks to you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s a rush of earth as Phil smoothes out the circle he\u2019s redrawn on the ground. By this point in his training, Dan\u2019s supposed to try to kill his fire before it reaches outside the boundary, and he usually manages.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat was all you, mate,\u201d says Phil. He reaches the middle of the circle, bumping their shoulders together. \u201cAt this rate, you\u2019ll be ready to go back to the Fire Nation soon.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows around a bittersweet rush in his chest at the thought.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  They start walking towards the town, shoulders still standing side by side. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re having dinner with your parents again, right?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil grins. \u201cWe are. But, fair warning, if it\u2019s not great it\u2019s because my mum is trying to follow a Fire Nation recipe tonight,\u201d he says. He looks up at Dan, their arms brushing, his face so very close. \u201cShe said she wanted to do something to remind you of home, since you\u2019ve been here so long.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his face flush as he mumbles: \u201cOh.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The responding laugh is pressed against his shoulder, and sounds almost like a giggle. It makes Dan\u2019s cheeks go even hotter.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThanks for the warning,\u201d he says, because he can\u2019t think of anything else. \u201cNow I can figure out how to thank her before she tells me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They go home that night with leftover bread.\n</p><p>\n  Mrs. Lester hugged them both goodbye, whispering to Dan that she hoped her rice wasn\u2019t too different from what they serve in the Fire Nation. Mr. Lester had shaken his hand with a kind smile. They\u2019d shoved a bag into Phil\u2019s arms and sent them to catch the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s another quiet ride, pressed together, watching the now-familiar desert landscape.\n</p><p>\n  When they get home, Dan whispers: \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile is crooked, warm even in the darkness, as he says it too.\n</p><p>\n  Dan slips into his bed, tucking himself under his blankets, and wonders when he started thinking about Phil\u2019s house as home.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  He wakes up with a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It takes him a moment to realize Phil\u2019s shaking him, saying his name over and over by his ear. And another beat too long to process the crackling of fire sounding loud, too close to his ear.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s sitting up. Phil\u2019s dragging him out of his bed, away from the drapes that Dan apparently lit on fire. In his sleep.\n</p><p>\n  \u201c\n  <i>\n    Fuck.\n  </i>\n  \u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil waves a hand. From the stone walls rise a little bubble of earth. Dan realizes only when Phil returns the room to normal that it choked out the fire on the now-charred curtains.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck,\u201d Dan says again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought that stopped happening.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s another tug at his shoulder. Phil\u2019s still clutching at his sleep shirt, still trying to pull him away from his bed, away from where the flames had blazed. Phil\u2019s hair, Dan realizes, is a mess atop his head. His eyes are too wide, a little unfocused. The fire must have woken him up.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stumbles to his feet, because Phil obviously wants him too.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t expect Phil to wrap his arms around him, hold him close.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou scared me,\u201d he says, the words muffled against Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you sleep firebend?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened in a while,\u201d Dan hears himself say. It must be the shock that has him being so honest. Or maybe it\u2019s the way Phil\u2019s pressed against him. \u201cI\u2013 we were working on my control back in the Fire Nation and that, at least, had gone away. I thought it was safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil squeezes him even tighter. \u201cYou are safe,\u201d he mumbles.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s pretty sure Phil\u2019s trying to reassure himself.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They curl up together in Phil\u2019s bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan almost protested. Only the drapes were burned, after all. The bed\u2019s fine. But Phil\u2019s still clinging to him, and Dan likes the warm press of someone against his chest.\n</p><p>\n  Of \n  <i>\n    Phil \n  </i>\n  against his chest. \n</p><p>\n  The sky\u2019s started to swirl in shades of pink outside. It must be bleeding into morning, the time when they\u2019d drag themselves out of bed to have breakfast before doing breathing exercises in the academy. This is comfier, though. It\u2019s better.\n</p><p>\n  It feels like Phil\u2019s practicing breathing exercises to stay calm. \n</p><p>\n  So Dan slides his hand into Phil\u2019s hair.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m okay, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cYou put out the fire and it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, pressing himself tighter against Dan\u2019s chest as though the louder echo of his heartbeat is reassuring. Maybe it is. Dan\u2019s fingers, now rubbing gentle circles against the back of Phil\u2019s head, seem to be. Some of the tension bleeds from Phil\u2019s shoulders.\n</p><p>\n  It feels less like a panicked hug, suddenly. More like cuddling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles at the ceiling. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou know how I asked if you had anxiety when we first met?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d whispers Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s fingers drift up along Dan\u2019s side, gentle, almost shy. They\u2019ve only ever really touched during lessons, haphazard adjustments of Dan\u2019s stance, of his breathing. This isn\u2019t that. Dan knows it isn\u2019t that when Phil\u2019s hand presses flat against the splay of his ribs as though to feel the rise and fall of his breathing.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI used to have anxiety,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI was terrified of the city, didn\u2019t talk to people much. It\u2019s part of why I\u2019m so good at teaching control. I had to, you know, relearn it for my own bending.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s hand clenches against the back of Phil\u2019s head. It must be comforting, because Phil hums, nestling even closer to him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOne of my friends died,\u201d he continues. \u201cIn a bending accident. Freak thing, but I was so scared.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dan whispers. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He tilts his head up, still pressed against Dan\u2019s shoulder, still so very close. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI just wanted you to know,\u201d says Phil. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2013 you scared me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay.\u201d Dan reaches up with his free hand, resting it on top of Phil\u2019s. \u201cYou can be scared. You don\u2019t always need to be in control, you know.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Half a smile quirks at the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s enough.\n</p><p>\n  Dan keeps holding him.\n</p><p>\n  And that\u2019s enough, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  It takes a few days for them to recover. \n</p><p>\n  They don\u2019t practice bending during those days. There\u2019s breathing exercises for a little while, and then just life. Phil takes Dan shopping the first day, to some of the nicer stores in Ba Sing Se, and then to lunch at a restaurant he loves but rarely goes to.\n</p><p>\n  He buys new drapes that day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan still doesn\u2019t sleep in his own bed.\n</p><p>\n  But when he curls up against Phil\u2019s back at night, he doesn\u2019t care to complain.\n</p><p>\n  Phil still teaches his classes in the afternoon, going through rudimentary earthbending while Dan sits in the corner and watches, not bothering to hide his smile.\n</p><p>\n  They play Pai Sho in the evenings.\n</p><p>\n  And on Thursday, when they go to bed, Dan doesn\u2019t question it when Phil leads him to his bedroom, so they can curl up side by side again. \n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you know what you were dreaming about? That night?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan cracks one eye open. They\u2019re supposed to be breathing, balancing on one leg, but Phil\u2019s standing in front of him with a curious furrow to his brow, both feet flat on the ground.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThe night of the fire?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNot really. I didn\u2019t even remember that day, to be honest,\u201d says Dan. He lets himself stand normally again, and stops the rhythmic counting of his breaths. \u201cI was thinking about going back to the Fire Nation when I fell asleep though, so maybe that.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It feels wrong to admit. His cheeks go warm. Phil\u2019s brows furrow further.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you not want to go back?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, really. I like it there. I just\u2013\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust what?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He feels himself smile, watching Phil mirror it. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI just like it here, a lot. Uh, with you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile goes brighter. It seems to shine in his eyes. Dan feels it, hot and fluttery, in his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI like you here, too.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They go back to the clearing on Sunday.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s the first time Dan\u2019s actually firebent since the incident, in a desert without drapes or duvets to light aflame. He\u2019s almost surprised to find his control hasn\u2019t dimmed. He can still stop his flames before they reach the perimeter, can still keep them from blazing too bright.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t bother to erase the circle before stepping towards Dan this time. His hands land on Dan\u2019s shoulders, rubbing gently at the muscle there.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re less tense,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re breathing well. And you\u2019re in tune with nature more. You\u2019re doing \u2026 good.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan grins. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s response is a smile. He looks up, his eyes bright, gleaming in the desert sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His hands are still on Dan\u2019s shoulders, holding on too tightly. For a moment, it looks like he might cry. Dan blinks against the realization that he might, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhy does it feel like you\u2019re saying goodbye?\u201d he whispers.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI could be?\u201d says Phil, voice shaky. \u201cYou could go back now, finish your training with your Master. You have control.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t let go. Dan reaches for him, just in case. His heart is racing, aching.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to say goodbye?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles at that, soft and hopeful. \u201cThen can I do something?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles back. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The hand on his left shoulder drifts, cradling the back of his neck so Phil can draw him forward. Their smiles meet. Dan\u2019s eyes drift closed.\n</p><p>\n  And they\u2019re kissing.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  The train back home is almost empty that night.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s head is resting against his shoulder, his hand on Dan\u2019s forearm. They don\u2019t look out the window. Dan\u2019s too busy wondering if he should hold Phil\u2019s hand, if that\u2019s something they do now that they\u2019ve kissed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI was thinking,\u201d says Phil, \u201cThat maybe you don\u2019t have to go back to the Fire Nation right away?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cYou could stay with me. The war\u2019s over, there\u2019s firebending Masters in Ba Sing Se. I know it\u2019s not your Master, but you could try to finish your training,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we could set up your old room to be a guest room. I know it\u2019s a long trip, but if your family wanted to visit, they could stay in there.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his head. Dan turns to catch how blue his eyes look in the low light of the night train.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUnless you\u2019d want it back, of course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan chuckles. Without looking away, he slips his hand into Phil\u2019s. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it back.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s teeth catch at his lip when he smiles. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you\u2019ll stay? At least for a little while?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s Dan that leans down to kiss him this time.\n</p><p>\n  And it\u2019s him who pulls away to mumble: \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t want the day to end when they get home. Neither does Phil, apparently, as he suggests they have tea before bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan warms the kettle with his firebending, standing in the middle of Phil\u2019s house of stone. They sip tea on the sofa without any games to play, without any distractions.\n</p><p>\n  And when they slip into bed, curled up under a dark sky and Poe the potted plant, now resting on Phil\u2019s windowsill, they kiss goodnight.\n</p>",

He tugs his hood over his head, pressing his face against the wall of the train. His knee bounces. His fingertips burn. He curls his hands into fists and sucks in a steady breath to keep from singing the sleeves of his tunic with his bare hands.\n</p><p>\n  He shouldn\u2019t be thinking such things. Before him lies a city that he knows fought valiantly, built itself back up after the war into something beautiful. It\u2019s full of sloped green and yellow roofs and plants blooming in the summer heat, and Dan just wishes he was back home, where walls were made of dark metal and the air seemed to shimmer with sparks.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019d never been to the Earth Kingdom. Though the war had ended and the four Nations now lived in peace as a single, United Republic, travel was still arduous, and Dan had never been particularly adventurous.\n</p><p>\n  In front of him, a child is running up and down the aisle. Across from him, a man is reading a book, glasses perched now on his nose. Next to him, the seat is empty.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swipes his fringe across his forehead and tries not to think too much about why.\n</p><p>\n  The train shudders to a stop eventually. The people of the Earth Kingdom seem to stand in unison, and Dan feels clumsy on his feet when he shoots up a second later. He stumbles down the steps.\n</p><p>\n  The ground here is sandy. He tries not to miss the stone from back home.\n</p><p>\n  He glances down at the map he was given, following its path through the city, past a shop that smells of Jasmine and another with pottery on display. It\u2019s not far from the train stop, the building with the Earth Kingdom symbol above it\u2019s door. \n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Master Phil\u2019s Earthbending Academy, \n  </i>\n  is written on the sign.\n</p><p>\n  Dan pushes the door open. A bell chimes above his head. A man with black hair and a beige shirt is standing there.\n</p><p>\n  He smiles. \u201cDan, right?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan can do nothing but nod.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re firebending Master speaks highly of you,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  They\u2019re sitting in a back room then, on cushions of plush green fabric. Dan\u2019s fingers dig into his knees so he doesn\u2019t fidget, so he doesn\u2019t risk fire sizzling from his palms.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m quite powerful,\u201d he says. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cAs have I,\u201d says Phil. Dan\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s talking about Dan or about himself. He doesn\u2019t bother to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s control you lack, correct?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He nods. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile quirks at just one corner of his mouth. \u201cI can help you with that,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Phil stands slowly, steadily, and picks up the cushion he\u2019d been kneeling on to toss it aside. Dan would laugh at it hitting the wall and falling atop a pot Dan\u2019s fairly certain Phil hadn\u2019t meant to touch, but he\u2019d been told by his Master that Phil was someone to respect.\n</p><p>\n  Master Lester, they\u2019d called him back home, but Phil\u2019s never mentioned his last name or his title.\n</p><p>\n  He looks back at Dan, a hint of laughter in his eyes. \u201cYou can stand, too,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, it would probably be better if you stood.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He grabs his cushion, too, and sets it aside more gently than Phil had, so the floor is empty. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019d like you to show me your firebending,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stomach sinks. He glances at the curtains open over windows and banners hanging from the ceiling, and tries not to think about the things he\u2019s accidentally lit aflame back home, in a kingdom built for his element. Here, he thinks, he could burn far too much.\n</p><p>\n  Phil must notice his frown. \u201cYou can stop it, can\u2019t you?\u201d he asks. And then, as though to prove his point, he opens his palm over the ground and raises a column of earth next to him, stopping at the perfect height to perch his arm on.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course I can stop it,\u201d hisses Dan. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil jerks his head to the side, still smiling. \u201cWell then, go ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He punches forward so a burst of flames flies towards a bare part of the wall. And again just for the sake of it. His open palm makes a stream of fire shoot forward, and a practiced flick of his wrist sends it whipping towards the ceiling. A spinning kick has a ring of fire forming at his feet, expanding until\u2013\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay, stop!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s pressed against the wall then. His column of earth has disappeared, his smile faded. Dan collapses forward, unsteady on his feet. A last burst of fire explodes from his fingertips, but he manages to stop it before it hits a drape hanging on the far wall.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, breath coming too quick.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Phil pushes himself off the wall, and side eyes a faint dark spot on one of his banners, where the fabric\u2019s been singed black. \n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his cheeks burn. He curls his hands into fists to keep the embarrassment from forming fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSorry,\u201d he repeats.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cReally, it\u2019s alright,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI agreed to help train you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to feel small when he mumbles: \u201cAnd?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Another lopsided smile quirks at the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth. \u201cAnd I think I can,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s set Dan up a room in his house.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s small, with a narrow bed wedged into the corner and little plants resting on the sill of a window looking over an alleyway. Phil\u2019s leaning against the door as Dan drops his bag, haphazardly stuffed full of Fire Nation clothing, by the foot of the bed. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI know it\u2019s not much,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles. \u201cI appreciate the hospitality.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He goes to bow, but Phil waves a hand before he can. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t burn Poe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cPoe?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  A hint of laughter gleams in Phil\u2019s eyes. He motions over Dan\u2019s shoulder, towards the window. \u201cThe little plant,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s special to me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. He makes a mental note to always tuck his hand nearest the wall under his duvet before falling asleep, lest his dreams make him firebend. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d says Phil. He pushes himself off the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s tea in the kitchen if you\u2019d like any before bed. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t need any help heating it up?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels himself grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine, sir.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, just once. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says, before turning around, walking away with slow, steady steps.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with breathing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s standing in the middle of the room when he says it, holding pebbles he picked up off the floor in his hand. He sucks in a deep breath, and sends one flying across the room into the furthest pot he has. Then the second, into a flowerpot he has by the door. And the third, which lands at Dan\u2019s feet. \n</p><p>\n  Dan wonders, for a moment, if it\u2019s supposed to be intimidating, but Phil just looks amused.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m bad at breathing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil flicks his hand, and the stone at Dan\u2019s feet flies back into his palm. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s important for firebending, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. \u201cIt is, yes.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThen you\u2019ll need to learn it,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He walks across the room, picks up one the cushions they sat on yesterday, and tosses it towards Dan. His aim\u2019s off, so it lands a few feet away with a quiet thud. Dan walks over to get it, returning it to his spot in the middle of the room, Phil watching him the whole time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits, legs crossed like they do back home.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you expect me to breathe evenly while you stare?\u201d he asks, perhaps a little more rude than his Master back home would permit.\n</p><p>\n  Phil just grins, and picks up a second cushion. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to breathe with you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They do nothing but breathe for the first day. \n</p><p>\n  Afterwards, Phil takes Dan out into the city, to a restaurant he likes to eat at when, in his own words, he\u2019s too lazy to cook. They eat more vegetables in the Earth Kingdom, Dan notices, as he watches Phil stuff a dumpling into his mouth, grinning as he watches Dan sip his tea.\n</p><p>\n  The second day, they breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  For lunch, Phil makes soup on a fire he trusts Dan to maintain, reminding him to breathe every time the flames burn too bright. Dan\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s a little overcooked by the end, and some of the broth boiled over the edge of the pot, but Phil doesn\u2019t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  The third day, they breathe \n  <i>\n    again. \n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Dan rests his hands on his knees and tries to count his breaths, slow counts of four and eight as he listens to the quiet puffs of Phil\u2019s from across the room. He fidgets. He knows he does, his feet going tingly numb and his shoulders aching from sitting up straight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cStay still,\u201d Phil says from across the room. \n</p><p>\n  When Dan opens his eyes, Phil\u2019s are still closed. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI can feel the earth moving,\u201d he says, like he knows Dan is staring.\n</p><p>\n  Dan lets his eyes fall closed and tries to breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  The fourth day, Phil\u2019s footsteps interrupt the silence.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s moved before calling for a break. Dan feels his chest go tight, his shoulders tense. He hears the hitch of his own breath, and the stilling of Phil\u2019s steps in response.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBreathe,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He counts to four in his head, lips moving around silent words, before sucking in another breath. Phil\u2019s footsteps echo in the room again, quiet, slow. Dan tries not to focus on the anxiety prickling at his spine.\n</p><p>\n  He wonders if it\u2019s his imagination, or if Phil\u2019s really staring at him so intently.\n</p><p>\n  The footsteps stop. Dan\u2019s breath hitches mid-exhale. There\u2019s a rustle of fabric behind him, and then a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re still tense,\u201d says Phil. He\u2019s so close, suddenly, that Dan can feel a rush of warm breath against his ear. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, holding his breath for a count of eight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you get anxious?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. \u201cYou know I do. My Master must have told you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cHe did,\u201d he admits. \u201cI wanted to hear it from you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn\u2019t ask why. He squeezes his eyes closed against the burn there, feeling his ribs shudder around another breath. The hand on his shoulder drifts down along his spine, slow and gentle, before settling on his side, splayed across his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou breathe in your chest,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIsn\u2019t that where your lungs are?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He laughs, still so close Dan can feel it. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you should breathe lower, deeper. It\u2019s more centering.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil draws away, stands up, and walks across the room, back to his own cushion.\n</p><p>\n  If he notices the shakiness in Dan\u2019s breathing, he doesn\u2019t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They leave the city on the seventh day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits on a train just like the one he arrived on, watching the city grow smaller, sparcer, until they pass the wall and it seems to disappear altogether. Phil\u2019s sitting next to him, leaning forward so they can look out the same window, their legs pressed together between their seats.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cLeft the city?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cI used to do it all the time when I was in training,\u201d he says. \u201cBut most of my students just learn at the academy. It\u2019s easier that way.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan hums back. He doesn\u2019t mention that he never really left his academy, either. Doesn\u2019t ask who trained Phil that way, and so successfully, if Dan\u2019s Master is to be trusted.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He sounds like he\u2019s smiling, but Dan doesn\u2019t turn to check.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They end up in a small town outside Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  The sandiness of the desert outside the city has sprouted small plants that dot the ground and a few small trees that surround the area. The houses are made of stone, with the same sloped roofs as they have in Ba Sing Se. Just next to the train, there\u2019s a man selling produce with a smile.\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to dip his head, to hide, as he steps off the train. The red of his fire nation clothing seems too obvious now, where everything blends in shades of green and brown.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMaster Phil,\u201d says the man. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were visiting.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  The man nods, grinning back, and presses a finger to his lips.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWho are we surprising?\u201d asks Dan where they\u2019re a few steps away and it doesn\u2019t feel so much like the blaze of his tunic is a burn on the earth tones of the town.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMy parents,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh.\u201d Dan glances around. There\u2019s an old woman sitting on a chair outside her house, and a little kid building a castle made of dirt. \u201cThey live here?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThey do.\u201d He turns to face Dan. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though, I didn\u2019t just bring you here for family dinner.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d he says again. \u201cDinner?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester are kind people, cloaked in green and wearing smiles. \n</p><p>\n  They draw Phil into a hug the moment he walks through the door, mumbling about how he should have told them he was coming, and especially that he was bringing company. Phil\u2019s dad smiles at Dan as his mum hugs him and it feels silly, to be standing in the doorway of a makeshift family reunion.\n</p><p>\n  And then Kath looks up at him, grins and says: \u201cOh, is this your new student?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s cheeks go the softest shade of pink. \u201cYeah, uh, this is Dan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s his first time in the Earth Kingdom.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBesides the last week in Ba Sing Se,\u201d says Dan. His teeth click together when he closes his mouth, and Phil puffs out a quiet laugh. \u201cI mean, uh, yeah. It\u2019s nice here. And nice to meet you guys, Mr. and Mrs. Lester.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  They both shake his hand. Dan realizes, only as they\u2019re pulling away, that he probably should have bowed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWould you guys like some tea or are you delving straight into training?\u201d asks Phil\u2019s mum.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think we\u2019ll do some training first,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI want to take him out to the\u2013 you know.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  She smiles. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil turns to him. His smile looks a lot like his mum\u2019s. \u201cIs that okay with you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Phil leads him out of the town, past some trees, to a clearing.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still see the houses from where they\u2019re standing. He can still tell where the train tracks cut across the landscape, where the man with the produce stand is probably still standing. The trees around them seem cut into a circle, perfectly cleared. The ground is almost perfectly flat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUh,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil walks to the center of the clearing, grins at Dan, and steps into a bending stance. He doesn\u2019t do anything fancy, or violent, or flashy. He just traces a circle in the earth around him, so thin it looks like he could be doing it with his fingertip.\n</p><p>\n  Dan realizes only then that, for his bending Master, he\u2019s hardly seen Phil bend at all.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s smiling when he looks up, the sun reflected in his eyes. \u201cThis is where I learned to bend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his mouth fall open. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, but it sounds more like a breath.\n</p><p>\n  The corners of Phil\u2019s eyes crinkle. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a blank canvas of sorts, where the village kids can learn without messing anything up in town,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents started teaching me when I was young. My brother has a little bit more of a temper than I do. He used to get so annoyed when I could control things more.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIs that why Master sent me to you?\u201d asks Dan. He hopes it sounds teasing. Phil seems to think it does.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cBecause I could move rocks without getting mad when I was a kid?\u201d he says. \u201cProbably not. At least I hope not, or all those years of training afterwards were a big waste of time.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s pretty sure he sounds more sincere than he should when he says: \u201cThey definitely weren\u2019t.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smile softens. He steps aside, leaving the center of the circle to beckon Dan towards him. If his knees were more bent, his elbow a little straighter, a stone may come flying past Dan\u2019s head, into his palm. The thought makes Dan smile. \n</p><p>\n  He should ask Phil to bend in front of him sometime. He\u2019s always enjoyed watching Masters.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s toes scuff the ground as he steps into the middle. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cSo, uh, why are we here?\u201d he asks. \u201cScared I would burn the academy down?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he says. \u201cSit down.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan does, folding his legs underneath him, crossing his hands over his lap. He wonders if Phil ever did the same, next to a brother, looking up at his parents and waiting for his earliest instructions on how to make the ground move. \n</p><p>\n  Next to him, Phil sits down too, so close that their knees bump together.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThe thing is, I can\u2019t really teach you how to bend the way I do my usual students, but earthbending and firebending are pretty similar,\u201d he says. \u201cYour Master sent you to me to improve your control over your bending. In my experience, the best way to do that is to ground yourself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His brows furrow. \u201cHow? I can\u2019t exactly feel the earth like you can.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d says Phil. \u201cBut you can focus on the world. Grounding yourself doesn\u2019t have to mean to the actual ground.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He reaches forward and rests a hand on Dan\u2019s knee, squeezing gently with a reassuring smile.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust do your breathing again, and focus on how things sound, how they feel. Trust me when I say it can help.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to ask how he knows, what he knows about Dan\u2019s trouble with controlling his fire, but Phil squeezes his knee again and stands before he can utter a word. He walks across the circle, until he\u2019s standing outside the perimeter he drew, and turns back to smile. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cGo ahead, breathe,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAre you going to watch me?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  If Dan were back home, he\u2019d hear the crackle of fire, feel the heaviness of humid heat on his skin.\n</p><p>\n  Here, he listens to the rustle of leaves through the trees, the distant squeals of children in the town. A train has come and gone since he sat down, and every now and then, he can hear Phil\u2019s footsteps, circling around him at a constant distance in a way that makes anxiety prickle along Dan\u2019s spine. \n</p><p>\n  He adjusts his hands on his thighs, sucks in another deep breath.\n</p><p>\n  The Earth Kingdom is hot, too, though it\u2019s more arid than the Fire Nation is. Dan\u2019s mouth can gone dry from the breaths he\u2019s taken. His palms are moist with sweat. When the wind picks up, specks of sand hit his face, just enough to make his skin sting.\n</p><p>\n  Part of him wants to move.\n</p><p>\n  He takes another deep breath, in through his nose, out through his mouth.\n</p><p>\n  His body feels heavy now, rooted to the ground. Even moving his hand to wipe the sweat from his palm feels like too much work. He\u2019s pretty sure his eyes will burn when he opens them, the desert sun still beating down on him as the afternoon drags on. \n</p><p>\n  A hand lands on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  He jumps. Phil\u2019s looking down at him, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFeel grounded?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan clenches his fist. His fingers feel almost numb, but steady. \u201cYeah, actually.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThen bend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tugs at the fabric of Dan\u2019s tunic, drawing him to his feet. \u201cBend,\u201d he repeats. \u201cSee how your control is now.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He steps away again, giving Dan a silent thumbs up from the sidelines as Dan adjusts his stance, lowering his center of balance, drawing his hands together in front of his chest. When he punches the air, a ball of flames erupts, flying forward until a pillar of stone rises to stop it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cKeep going!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  So Dan does it again, with an open palm this time, so a stream of fire bursts forth. He can control it this time, whipping it towards the ground and letting it fizzle out upon contact.\n</p><p>\n  He does the same with his right hand before kicking forward, making another ball of flames that Phil stops with his earthbending.\n</p><p>\n  The flames still burn brighter, more violently than he\u2019d want, but when Dan plants both feet on the ground again, no sparks fizzle at his fingertips.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat was great!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan turns on his heel. Phil\u2019s grinning, so wide and happy it has some of the rush fading. His breathing slows. He feels himself smile, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt helped,\u201d he says. \u201cIt actually helped.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They have soup for dinner.\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester tell stories of Phil\u2019s childhood. They talk about when they moved into the city for the sake of Phil\u2019s training, and about moving back after the academy had been set up. They ask about Dan\u2019s life back in the Fire Nation, about his family, his Master, and how he\u2019s liking the Earth Kingdom. \n</p><p>\n  Phil asks if they can come back next week, and his mum assures him that they most certainly can as she draws him into a goodbye hug.\n</p><p>\n  And then they get on the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s emptier this time, just a few people dotting seats. Dan sits by the window, head resting against the wall as Phil slides into the seat next to him. Their knees knock together, their shoulders bumping. Dan may be wrong, but he feels like they\u2019re closer this time.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWas that too much?\u201d asks Phil, once the train has drawn away and the town has faded into the blur.\n</p><p>\n  Dan looks over. His smile feels sleepy. \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI just realized I probably should have warned you before taking you to my parents\u2019 house.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Between them, Dan nudges their feet together, pressing himself closer to Phil. There\u2019s a strange urge to reach out, squeeze Phil\u2019s knee like he\u2019d done to Dan earlier, but he clenches his hand into a fist against his own thigh instead. It feels simpler that way.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt was fun,\u201d he says. \u201cTiring, but fun.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s responding smile is soft. \u201cYou should nap. I\u2019ll wake you up when we get there.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still pressed together when Dan drifts off to sleep.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  The next week follows the same routine.\n</p><p>\n  They practice breathing, have lunch, and practice breathing again. Dan watches Phil host classes for young earthbenders in the afternoons, kids who accidentally slam rocks into the walls and raise pillars to the ceiling. It almost makes Dan feel better about his own lack of control as he tries to muffle his laughs against his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It makes him understand why his Master sent him to Phil, as Dan watches him steady young teenagers.\n</p><p>\n  They play games at night. Some nights it\u2019s Pai Sho, on a board that once belonged to Phil\u2019s grandfather, with the clumsy strategy of two people who\u2019ve really learned how to play. Others, it\u2019s cards, arranged on the table between them as they sip tea and share stories.\n</p><p>\n  One night, Dan introduces Phil to gambling like they do in the Fire Nation, though Phil refuses to bet on anything more important than who pays for lunch the next day.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tells him about his aunt who tailors clothing and his grandma who claimed to be psychic. Dan tells him about his younger brother who can\u2019t bend but plays Kuai Ball better than Dan ever could and his nana who\u2019s always tried to teach him balance, though he never seemed to learn. \n</p><p>\n  On the weekend, they go back to Phil\u2019s parents\u2019, meditating in a clearing before eating soup around the dining table.\n</p><p>\n  They sit on the train back home together, pressed close and staring out the same window.\n</p><p>\n  At the end of the night, Dan\u2019s hand hovers over his doorknob as he whispers: \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The lights from outside allow him to see Phil\u2019s smile. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says, and then slips into his bedroom.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re going to try something different today.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s Monday morning, the sun high in the sky over Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think we need to work on your balance, too,\u201d says Phil. \u201cWatching you bend, you seem a little shaky. It could impact your control.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan picks at the belt tied around his waist. It\u2019s silly, he thinks, that he cheeks flush at the observation, as though he doesn\u2019t already know. When he was young, the force of bending would send him falling backwards sometimes, so he\u2019d scrape his palms and send his fire flying forward.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cProbably,\u201d he says. \u201cI can be, uh, kind of clumsy. I blame the growth spurt.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  A smile cracks across Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI can relate,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite clumsy myself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re literally the most steady earthbender I know,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s response is a laugh, quiet and happy and growing familiar. \u201cHow many earthbenders do you know?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUh.\u201d His cheeks get warmer. He can feel the morning sun hot against his right cheek, can see it gleaming in the corner of his vision. \u201cI\u2019ve met a bunch of kids.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSome of them are probably steadier than me,\u201d says Phil. \u201cIn everyday life, at least. I only have balance when bending. I learned to ground myself for it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGrounding has way too many definitions in earthbending.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile widens, even as he rolls his eyes. It makes Dan\u2019s chest go tight.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust come here,\u201d says Phil\n</p><p>\n  Dan does.\n</p><p>\n  He ends up facing away from Phil, only a few inches between them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGet into your bending stance,\u201d says Phil. He\u2019s so close, it\u2019s barely a whisper against Dan\u2019s ear. \n</p><p>\n  He didn\u2019t mean to be this close. It feels like it\u2019d be weird to step away now. Dan\u2019s not even sure he wants to. Having Phil\u2019s voice so close, he realizes, isn\u2019t uncomfortable. \n</p><p>\n  Not in the way he would have expected, at least. \n</p><p>\n  He bends his knees, settling onto his heels, bringing his hands in front of his chest. Every move starts from here, he learned when he was just a kid. His power is centered here, in the press of his fist to his palm, the balance of his frame over the ground.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGood,\u201d says Phil. \n</p><p>\n  Dan bites his lip, ignoring the goosebumps that rise along his spine.\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil\u2019s hands settle on his hips. Dan has to swallow to keep from making a noise, has to focus to keep his hands from falling to his sides.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re tall,\u201d says Phil, like he doesn\u2019t notice a thing, \u201cSo you need to lower your center of balance more than most people.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He presses against Dan\u2019s hips, gently, lowering him ever so slightly.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIs that better?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you feel steadier?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. He doesn\u2019t feel steadier at all. Even his insides feel shaky now, his pulse stuttering where it thuds in his throat, his fingers quivering as he keeps them clenched in a fist. Phil\u2019s breath is still warm against the back of his neck, his hands still resting at Dan\u2019s sides, as though waiting to adjust him more, if needed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI, uh, I think so?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil draws back then. Dan counts enough footsteps to reach edge of the room. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cTry to bend, then,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan hesitates before shifting his weight, leaning back so he can kick his foot up and make a ball of flames fly through the air.\n</p><p>\n  He feels like he might fall over, like he did when he was little.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s not the fire\u2019s fault this time.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Phil buys lunch that day.\n</p><p>\n  They sit across from each other at a table in the corner of the room, with bowls of noodles and cups of tea. For the first time in a long time, they don\u2019t really talk.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still feel the phantom press of Phil\u2019s palms against his body.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to imagine it lasting longer.\n</p><p>\n  Under the table, their legs brush together. Over the edge of his cup, he can see Phil\u2019s cheeks go pink.\n</p><p>\n  He tries even harder not to wonder if Phil\u2019s thinking about it, too.\n</p><p>\n  They slip out of their seats at the same time, and fall into step on the walk between the restaurant and the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Their shoulders press together.\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn\u2019t pull away.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan says it on a Thursday night, when the sky has fallen so dark that their lazy game of cards is lit up only by the torch he lit earlier. He\u2019s curled up on his side on Phil\u2019s living room floor, splayed over cushions they dragged in from the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Phil throws a card into the space between them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  He fidgets with his own cards for a second, before resting a card with the earthbending emblem in its center down. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cHas it been weird, spending so much time with me suddenly?\u201d says Dan. \u201cI mean, you must have had a life before this.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, muffling it with a sip of his cherry-berry lemonade. \u201cDebatable.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. \u201cI just, didn\u2019t have much to do, I guess? I don\u2019t have many friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m quite the introvert, I guess.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. \u201cI, uh, same.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s next card has the airbending symbol on it. Dan\u2019s has fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I ask you something else?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil giggles. The firelight flickers across his cheekbones and makes the yellow flecks in his eyes stand out. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cHas it felt, I don\u2019t know, intrusive to have me here?\u201d says Dan. \u201cYou know, since you\u2019re an introvert.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He hums, and rests a card with another firebending emblem into the game. \u201cHonestly?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil looks up. He\u2019s smiling, soft and sweet, the kind reserved for quiet nights in, rather than the excitement of bending. His finger is tracing the edge of his playing cards, and though it\u2019s been days, Dan can still feel the foreign touch of Phil\u2019s hands on his hips.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think too hard about why.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI like it,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI feel like we, I don\u2019t know, work well together. It doesn\u2019t really feel like your a stranger, or even a student, in my house, you know?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He wonders if the tinge of pink on Phil\u2019s cheeks is a blush or from the orange of the fire.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cI know. It feels like we\u2019re \u2026 friends?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles wider. \u201cYeah, friends.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  That weekend, they stand in the clearing outside Phil\u2019s hometown again.\n</p><p>\n  Dan watches the last of his flames die out, crashing against a pillar Phil makes rise and fall in the span of a minute. He\u2019s lunging forward, palm splayed wide, thrust in front of him. His chest is heaving. He\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s the longest stretch he\u2019s bent for.\n</p><p>\n  The longest he\u2019s gone without losing control.\n</p><p>\n  He settles back, standing up straight, watching the sand blow in the wind before him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re doing really well,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can hear his smile before he sees it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThanks to you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s a rush of earth as Phil smoothes out the circle he\u2019s redrawn on the ground. By this point in his training, Dan\u2019s supposed to try to kill his fire before it reaches outside the boundary, and he usually manages.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat was all you, mate,\u201d says Phil. He reaches the middle of the circle, bumping their shoulders together. \u201cAt this rate, you\u2019ll be ready to go back to the Fire Nation soon.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows around a bittersweet rush in his chest at the thought.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah.\u201d \n</p><p>\n  They start walking towards the town, shoulders still standing side by side. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cWe\u2019re having dinner with your parents again, right?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil grins. \u201cWe are. But, fair warning, if it\u2019s not great it\u2019s because my mum is trying to follow a Fire Nation recipe tonight,\u201d he says. He looks up at Dan, their arms brushing, his face so very close. \u201cShe said she wanted to do something to remind you of home, since you\u2019ve been here so long.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his face flush as he mumbles: \u201cOh.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The responding laugh is pressed against his shoulder, and sounds almost like a giggle. It makes Dan\u2019s cheeks go even hotter.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThanks for the warning,\u201d he says, because he can\u2019t think of anything else. \u201cNow I can figure out how to thank her before she tells me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They go home that night with leftover bread.\n</p><p>\n  Mrs. Lester hugged them both goodbye, whispering to Dan that she hoped her rice wasn\u2019t too different from what they serve in the Fire Nation. Mr. Lester had shaken his hand with a kind smile. They\u2019d shoved a bag into Phil\u2019s arms and sent them to catch the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s another quiet ride, pressed together, watching the now-familiar desert landscape.\n</p><p>\n  When they get home, Dan whispers: \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile is crooked, warm even in the darkness, as he says it too.\n</p><p>\n  Dan slips into his bed, tucking himself under his blankets, and wonders when he started thinking about Phil\u2019s house as home.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  He wakes up with a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It takes him a moment to realize Phil\u2019s shaking him, saying his name over and over by his ear. And another beat too long to process the crackling of fire sounding loud, too close to his ear.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck!\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s sitting up. Phil\u2019s dragging him out of his bed, away from the drapes that Dan apparently lit on fire. In his sleep.\n</p><p>\n  \u201c\n  <i>\n    Fuck.\n  </i>\n  \u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil waves a hand. From the stone walls rise a little bubble of earth. Dan realizes only when Phil returns the room to normal that it choked out the fire on the now-charred curtains.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck,\u201d Dan says again. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought that stopped happening.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s another tug at his shoulder. Phil\u2019s still clutching at his sleep shirt, still trying to pull him away from his bed, away from where the flames had blazed. Phil\u2019s hair, Dan realizes, is a mess atop his head. His eyes are too wide, a little unfocused. The fire must have woken him up.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stumbles to his feet, because Phil obviously wants him too.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t expect Phil to wrap his arms around him, hold him close.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou scared me,\u201d he says, the words muffled against Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you sleep firebend?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened in a while,\u201d Dan hears himself say. It must be the shock that has him being so honest. Or maybe it\u2019s the way Phil\u2019s pressed against him. \u201cI\u2013 we were working on my control back in the Fire Nation and that, at least, had gone away. I thought it was safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil squeezes him even tighter. \u201cYou are safe,\u201d he mumbles.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s pretty sure Phil\u2019s trying to reassure himself.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They curl up together in Phil\u2019s bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan almost protested. Only the drapes were burned, after all. The bed\u2019s fine. But Phil\u2019s still clinging to him, and Dan likes the warm press of someone against his chest.\n</p><p>\n  Of \n  <i>\n    Phil \n  </i>\n  against his chest. \n</p><p>\n  The sky\u2019s started to swirl in shades of pink outside. It must be bleeding into morning, the time when they\u2019d drag themselves out of bed to have breakfast before doing breathing exercises in the academy. This is comfier, though. It\u2019s better.\n</p><p>\n  It feels like Phil\u2019s practicing breathing exercises to stay calm. \n</p><p>\n  So Dan slides his hand into Phil\u2019s hair.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m okay, I promise,\u201d he says. \u201cYou put out the fire and it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, pressing himself tighter against Dan\u2019s chest as though the louder echo of his heartbeat is reassuring. Maybe it is. Dan\u2019s fingers, now rubbing gentle circles against the back of Phil\u2019s head, seem to be. Some of the tension bleeds from Phil\u2019s shoulders.\n</p><p>\n  It feels less like a panicked hug, suddenly. More like cuddling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles at the ceiling. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou know how I asked if you had anxiety when we first met?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d whispers Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s fingers drift up along Dan\u2019s side, gentle, almost shy. They\u2019ve only ever really touched during lessons, haphazard adjustments of Dan\u2019s stance, of his breathing. This isn\u2019t that. Dan knows it isn\u2019t that when Phil\u2019s hand presses flat against the splay of his ribs as though to feel the rise and fall of his breathing.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI used to have anxiety,\u201d says Phil. \u201cI was terrified of the city, didn\u2019t talk to people much. It\u2019s part of why I\u2019m so good at teaching control. I had to, you know, relearn it for my own bending.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s hand clenches against the back of Phil\u2019s head. It must be comforting, because Phil hums, nestling even closer to him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOne of my friends died,\u201d he continues. \u201cIn a bending accident. Freak thing, but I was so scared.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dan whispers. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He tilts his head up, still pressed against Dan\u2019s shoulder, still so very close. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI just wanted you to know,\u201d says Phil. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2013 you scared me.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOkay.\u201d Dan reaches up with his free hand, resting it on top of Phil\u2019s. \u201cYou can be scared. You don\u2019t always need to be in control, you know.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Half a smile quirks at the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s enough.\n</p><p>\n  Dan keeps holding him.\n</p><p>\n  And that\u2019s enough, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  It takes a few days for them to recover. \n</p><p>\n  They don\u2019t practice bending during those days. There\u2019s breathing exercises for a little while, and then just life. Phil takes Dan shopping the first day, to some of the nicer stores in Ba Sing Se, and then to lunch at a restaurant he loves but rarely goes to.\n</p><p>\n  He buys new drapes that day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan still doesn\u2019t sleep in his own bed.\n</p><p>\n  But when he curls up against Phil\u2019s back at night, he doesn\u2019t care to complain.\n</p><p>\n  Phil still teaches his classes in the afternoon, going through rudimentary earthbending while Dan sits in the corner and watches, not bothering to hide his smile.\n</p><p>\n  They play Pai Sho in the evenings.\n</p><p>\n  And on Thursday, when they go to bed, Dan doesn\u2019t question it when Phil leads him to his bedroom, so they can curl up side by side again. \n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you know what you were dreaming about? That night?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan cracks one eye open. They\u2019re supposed to be breathing, balancing on one leg, but Phil\u2019s standing in front of him with a curious furrow to his brow, both feet flat on the ground.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThe night of the fire?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNot really. I didn\u2019t even remember that day, to be honest,\u201d says Dan. He lets himself stand normally again, and stops the rhythmic counting of his breaths. \u201cI was thinking about going back to the Fire Nation when I fell asleep though, so maybe that.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It feels wrong to admit. His cheeks go warm. Phil\u2019s brows furrow further.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you not want to go back?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, really. I like it there. I just\u2013\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cJust what?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He feels himself smile, watching Phil mirror it. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cI just like it here, a lot. Uh, with you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile goes brighter. It seems to shine in his eyes. Dan feels it, hot and fluttery, in his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI like you here, too.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They go back to the clearing on Sunday.\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s the first time Dan\u2019s actually firebent since the incident, in a desert without drapes or duvets to light aflame. He\u2019s almost surprised to find his control hasn\u2019t dimmed. He can still stop his flames before they reach the perimeter, can still keep them from blazing too bright.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t bother to erase the circle before stepping towards Dan this time. His hands land on Dan\u2019s shoulders, rubbing gently at the muscle there.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re less tense,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re breathing well. And you\u2019re in tune with nature more. You\u2019re doing \u2026 good.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan grins. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s response is a smile. He looks up, his eyes bright, gleaming in the desert sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His hands are still on Dan\u2019s shoulders, holding on too tightly. For a moment, it looks like he might cry. Dan blinks against the realization that he might, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhy does it feel like you\u2019re saying goodbye?\u201d he whispers.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI could be?\u201d says Phil, voice shaky. \u201cYou could go back now, finish your training with your Master. You have control.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t let go. Dan reaches for him, just in case. His heart is racing, aching.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to say goodbye?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles at that, soft and hopeful. \u201cThen can I do something?\u201d he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles back. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The hand on his left shoulder drifts, cradling the back of his neck so Phil can draw him forward. Their smiles meet. Dan\u2019s eyes drift closed.\n</p><p>\n  And they\u2019re kissing.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  The train back home is almost empty that night.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s head is resting against his shoulder, his hand on Dan\u2019s forearm. They don\u2019t look out the window. Dan\u2019s too busy wondering if he should hold Phil\u2019s hand, if that\u2019s something they do now that they\u2019ve kissed.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI was thinking,\u201d says Phil, \u201cThat maybe you don\u2019t have to go back to the Fire Nation right away?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah?\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. \u201cYou could stay with me. The war\u2019s over, there\u2019s firebending Masters in Ba Sing Se. I know it\u2019s not your Master, but you could try to finish your training,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we could set up your old room to be a guest room. I know it\u2019s a long trip, but if your family wanted to visit, they could stay in there.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his head. Dan turns to catch how blue his eyes look in the low light of the night train.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUnless you\u2019d want it back, of course.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan chuckles. Without looking away, he slips his hand into Phil\u2019s. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it back.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s teeth catch at his lip when he smiles. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you\u2019ll stay? At least for a little while?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  It\u2019s Dan that leans down to kiss him this time.\n</p><p>\n  And it\u2019s him who pulls away to mumble: \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  He doesn\u2019t want the day to end when they get home. Neither does Phil, apparently, as he suggests they have tea before bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan warms the kettle with his firebending, standing in the middle of Phil\u2019s house of stone. They sip tea on the sofa without any games to play, without any distractions.\n</p><p>\n  And when they slip into bed, curled up under a dark sky and Poe the potted plant, now resting on Phil\u2019s windowsill, they kiss goodnight.\n</p>",

He tugs his hood over his head, pressing his face against the wall of the train. His knee bounces. His fingertips burn. He curls his hands into fists and sucks in a steady breath to keep from singing the sleeves of his tunic with his bare hands.\n</p><p>\n  He shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking such things. Before him lies a city that he knows fought valiantly, built itself back up after the war into something beautiful. It&rsquo;s full of sloped green and yellow roofs and plants blooming in the summer heat, and Dan just wishes he was back home, where walls were made of dark metal and the air seemed to shimmer with sparks.\n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;d never been to the Earth Kingdom. Though the war had ended and the four Nations now lived in peace as a single, United Republic, travel was still arduous, and Dan had never been particularly adventurous.\n</p><p>\n  In front of him, a child is running up and down the aisle. Across from him, a man is reading a book, glasses perched now on his nose. Next to him, the seat is empty.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swipes his fringe across his forehead and tries not to think too much about why.\n</p><p>\n  The train shudders to a stop eventually. The people of the Earth Kingdom seem to stand in unison, and Dan feels clumsy on his feet when he shoots up a second later. He stumbles down the steps.\n</p><p>\n  The ground here is sandy. He tries not to miss the stone from back home.\n</p><p>\n  He glances down at the map he was given, following its path through the city, past a shop that smells of Jasmine and another with pottery on display. It&rsquo;s not far from the train stop, the building with the Earth Kingdom symbol above it&rsquo;s door. \n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Master Phil&rsquo;s Earthbending Academy, \n  </i>\n  is written on the sign.\n</p><p>\n  Dan pushes the door open. A bell chimes above his head. A man with black hair and a beige shirt is standing there.\n</p><p>\n  He smiles. &ldquo;Dan, right?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan can do nothing but nod.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re firebending Master speaks highly of you,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  They&rsquo;re sitting in a back room then, on cushions of plush green fabric. Dan&rsquo;s fingers dig into his knees so he doesn&rsquo;t fidget, so he doesn&rsquo;t risk fire sizzling from his palms.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m quite powerful,&rdquo; he says. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;As have I,&rdquo; says Phil. Dan&rsquo;s not sure if he&rsquo;s talking about Dan or about himself. He doesn&rsquo;t bother to ask. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s control you lack, correct?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He nods. &ldquo;That is correct.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s smile quirks at just one corner of his mouth. &ldquo;I can help you with that,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  Phil stands slowly, steadily, and picks up the cushion he&rsquo;d been kneeling on to toss it aside. Dan would laugh at it hitting the wall and falling atop a pot Dan&rsquo;s fairly certain Phil hadn&rsquo;t meant to touch, but he&rsquo;d been told by his Master that Phil was someone to respect.\n</p><p>\n  Master Lester, they&rsquo;d called him back home, but Phil&rsquo;s never mentioned his last name or his title.\n</p><p>\n  He looks back at Dan, a hint of laughter in his eyes. &ldquo;You can stand, too,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Actually, it would probably be better if you stood.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He grabs his cushion, too, and sets it aside more gently than Phil had, so the floor is empty. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to show me your firebending,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stomach sinks. He glances at the curtains open over windows and banners hanging from the ceiling, and tries not to think about the things he&rsquo;s accidentally lit aflame back home, in a kingdom built for his element. Here, he thinks, he could burn far too much.\n</p><p>\n  Phil must notice his frown. &ldquo;You can stop it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asks. And then, as though to prove his point, he opens his palm over the ground and raises a column of earth next to him, stopping at the perfect height to perch his arm on.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Of course I can stop it,&rdquo; hisses Dan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a child.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil jerks his head to the side, still smiling. &ldquo;Well then, go ahead.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan does. He punches forward so a burst of flames flies towards a bare part of the wall. And again just for the sake of it. His open palm makes a stream of fire shoot forward, and a practiced flick of his wrist sends it whipping towards the ceiling. A spinning kick has a ring of fire forming at his feet, expanding until&ndash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Okay, stop!&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s pressed against the wall then. His column of earth has disappeared, his smile faded. Dan collapses forward, unsteady on his feet. A last burst of fire explodes from his fingertips, but he manages to stop it before it hits a drape hanging on the far wall.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he says, breath coming too quick.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Phil pushes himself off the wall, and side eyes a faint dark spot on one of his banners, where the fabric&rsquo;s been singed black. \n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his cheeks burn. He curls his hands into fists to keep the embarrassment from forming fire.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he repeats.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Really, it&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;I agreed to help train you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to feel small when he mumbles: &ldquo;And?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Another lopsided smile quirks at the corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;And I think I can,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s set Dan up a room in his house.\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s small, with a narrow bed wedged into the corner and little plants resting on the sill of a window looking over an alleyway. Phil&rsquo;s leaning against the door as Dan drops his bag, haphazardly stuffed full of Fire Nation clothing, by the foot of the bed. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not much,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles. &ldquo;I appreciate the hospitality.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He goes to bow, but Phil waves a hand before he can. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t burn Poe.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Poe?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  A hint of laughter gleams in Phil&rsquo;s eyes. He motions over Dan&rsquo;s shoulder, towards the window. &ldquo;The little plant,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s special to me.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says Dan. He makes a mental note to always tuck his hand nearest the wall under his duvet before falling asleep, lest his dreams make him firebend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep him safe.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I appreciate that,&rdquo; says Phil. He pushes himself off the wall. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s tea in the kitchen if you&rsquo;d like any before bed. I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t need any help heating it up?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels himself grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be fine, sir.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, just once. &ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; he says, before turning around, walking away with slow, steady steps.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to start with breathing.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s standing in the middle of the room when he says it, holding pebbles he picked up off the floor in his hand. He sucks in a deep breath, and sends one flying across the room into the furthest pot he has. Then the second, into a flowerpot he has by the door. And the third, which lands at Dan&rsquo;s feet. \n</p><p>\n  Dan wonders, for a moment, if it&rsquo;s supposed to be intimidating, but Phil just looks amused.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bad at breathing.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil flicks his hand, and the stone at Dan&rsquo;s feet flies back into his palm. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s important for firebending, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. &ldquo;It is, yes.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll need to learn it,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He walks across the room, picks up one the cushions they sat on yesterday, and tosses it towards Dan. His aim&rsquo;s off, so it lands a few feet away with a quiet thud. Dan walks over to get it, returning it to his spot in the middle of the room, Phil watching him the whole time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits, legs crossed like they do back home.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Do you expect me to breathe evenly while you stare?&rdquo; he asks, perhaps a little more rude than his Master back home would permit.\n</p><p>\n  Phil just grins, and picks up a second cushion. &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to breathe with you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They do nothing but breathe for the first day. \n</p><p>\n  Afterwards, Phil takes Dan out into the city, to a restaurant he likes to eat at when, in his own words, he&rsquo;s too lazy to cook. They eat more vegetables in the Earth Kingdom, Dan notices, as he watches Phil stuff a dumpling into his mouth, grinning as he watches Dan sip his tea.\n</p><p>\n  The second day, they breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  For lunch, Phil makes soup on a fire he trusts Dan to maintain, reminding him to breathe every time the flames burn too bright. Dan&rsquo;s pretty sure it&rsquo;s a little overcooked by the end, and some of the broth boiled over the edge of the pot, but Phil doesn&rsquo;t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  The third day, they breathe \n  <i>\n    again. \n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Dan rests his hands on his knees and tries to count his breaths, slow counts of four and eight as he listens to the quiet puffs of Phil&rsquo;s from across the room. He fidgets. He knows he does, his feet going tingly numb and his shoulders aching from sitting up straight.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Stay still,&rdquo; Phil says from across the room. \n</p><p>\n  When Dan opens his eyes, Phil&rsquo;s are still closed. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I can feel the earth moving,&rdquo; he says, like he knows Dan is staring.\n</p><p>\n  Dan lets his eyes fall closed and tries to breathe again.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  The fourth day, Phil&rsquo;s footsteps interrupt the silence.\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s the first time he&rsquo;s moved before calling for a break. Dan feels his chest go tight, his shoulders tense. He hears the hitch of his own breath, and the stilling of Phil&rsquo;s steps in response.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Breathe,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He counts to four in his head, lips moving around silent words, before sucking in another breath. Phil&rsquo;s footsteps echo in the room again, quiet, slow. Dan tries not to focus on the anxiety prickling at his spine.\n</p><p>\n  He wonders if it&rsquo;s his imagination, or if Phil&rsquo;s really staring at him so intently.\n</p><p>\n  The footsteps stop. Dan&rsquo;s breath hitches mid-exhale. There&rsquo;s a rustle of fabric behind him, and then a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still tense,&rdquo; says Phil. He&rsquo;s so close, suddenly, that Dan can feel a rush of warm breath against his ear. &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, holding his breath for a count of eight.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Do you get anxious?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He swallows. &ldquo;You know I do. My Master must have told you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. &ldquo;He did,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;I wanted to hear it from you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn&rsquo;t ask why. He squeezes his eyes closed against the burn there, feeling his ribs shudder around another breath. The hand on his shoulder drifts down along his spine, slow and gentle, before settling on his side, splayed across his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You breathe in your chest,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that where your lungs are?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He laughs, still so close Dan can feel it. &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But you should breathe lower, deeper. It&rsquo;s more centering.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil draws away, stands up, and walks across the room, back to his own cushion.\n</p><p>\n  If he notices the shakiness in Dan&rsquo;s breathing, he doesn&rsquo;t mention it.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They leave the city on the seventh day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan sits on a train just like the one he arrived on, watching the city grow smaller, sparcer, until they pass the wall and it seems to disappear altogether. Phil&rsquo;s sitting next to him, leaning forward so they can look out the same window, their legs pressed together between their seats.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve done this,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Left the city?&rdquo; says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. &ldquo;I used to do it all the time when I was in training,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But most of my students just learn at the academy. It&rsquo;s easier that way.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan hums back. He doesn&rsquo;t mention that he never really left his academy, either. Doesn&rsquo;t ask who trained Phil that way, and so successfully, if Dan&rsquo;s Master is to be trusted.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He sounds like he&rsquo;s smiling, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t turn to check.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They end up in a small town outside Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  The sandiness of the desert outside the city has sprouted small plants that dot the ground and a few small trees that surround the area. The houses are made of stone, with the same sloped roofs as they have in Ba Sing Se. Just next to the train, there&rsquo;s a man selling produce with a smile.\n</p><p>\n  Dan tries not to dip his head, to hide, as he steps off the train. The red of his fire nation clothing seems too obvious now, where everything blends in shades of green and brown.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Master Phil,&rdquo; says the man. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were visiting.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a surprise,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  The man nods, grinning back, and presses a finger to his lips.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Who are we surprising?&rdquo; asks Dan where they&rsquo;re a few steps away and it doesn&rsquo;t feel so much like the blaze of his tunic is a burn on the earth tones of the town.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;My parents,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Dan glances around. There&rsquo;s an old woman sitting on a chair outside her house, and a little kid building a castle made of dirt. &ldquo;They live here?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;They do.&rdquo; He turns to face Dan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, though, I didn&rsquo;t just bring you here for family dinner.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says again. &ldquo;Dinner?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester are kind people, cloaked in green and wearing smiles. \n</p><p>\n  They draw Phil into a hug the moment he walks through the door, mumbling about how he should have told them he was coming, and especially that he was bringing company. Phil&rsquo;s dad smiles at Dan as his mum hugs him and it feels silly, to be standing in the doorway of a makeshift family reunion.\n</p><p>\n  And then Kath looks up at him, grins and says: &ldquo;Oh, is this your new student?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s cheeks go the softest shade of pink. &ldquo;Yeah, uh, this is Dan,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his first time in the Earth Kingdom.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Besides the last week in Ba Sing Se,&rdquo; says Dan. His teeth click together when he closes his mouth, and Phil puffs out a quiet laugh. &ldquo;I mean, uh, yeah. It&rsquo;s nice here. And nice to meet you guys, Mr. and Mrs. Lester.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  They both shake his hand. Dan realizes, only as they&rsquo;re pulling away, that he probably should have bowed.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Would you guys like some tea or are you delving straight into training?&rdquo; asks Phil&rsquo;s mum.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll do some training first,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;I want to take him out to the&ndash; you know.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  She smiles. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil turns to him. His smile looks a lot like his mum&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Is that okay with you?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Phil leads him out of the town, past some trees, to a clearing.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still see the houses from where they&rsquo;re standing. He can still tell where the train tracks cut across the landscape, where the man with the produce stand is probably still standing. The trees around them seem cut into a circle, perfectly cleared. The ground is almost perfectly flat.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil walks to the center of the clearing, grins at Dan, and steps into a bending stance. He doesn&rsquo;t do anything fancy, or violent, or flashy. He just traces a circle in the earth around him, so thin it looks like he could be doing it with his fingertip.\n</p><p>\n  Dan realizes only then that, for his bending Master, he&rsquo;s hardly seen Phil bend at all.\n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;s smiling when he looks up, the sun reflected in his eyes. &ldquo;This is where I learned to bend.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his mouth fall open. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says, but it sounds more like a breath.\n</p><p>\n  The corners of Phil&rsquo;s eyes crinkle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s meant to be a blank canvas of sorts, where the village kids can learn without messing anything up in town,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My parents started teaching me when I was young. My brother has a little bit more of a temper than I do. He used to get so annoyed when I could control things more.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Is that why Master sent me to you?&rdquo; asks Dan. He hopes it sounds teasing. Phil seems to think it does.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Because I could move rocks without getting mad when I was a kid?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Probably not. At least I hope not, or all those years of training afterwards were a big waste of time.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s pretty sure he sounds more sincere than he should when he says: &ldquo;They definitely weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil smile softens. He steps aside, leaving the center of the circle to beckon Dan towards him. If his knees were more bent, his elbow a little straighter, a stone may come flying past Dan&rsquo;s head, into his palm. The thought makes Dan smile. \n</p><p>\n  He should ask Phil to bend in front of him sometime. He&rsquo;s always enjoyed watching Masters.\n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s toes scuff the ground as he steps into the middle. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;So, uh, why are we here?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Scared I would burn the academy down?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan does, folding his legs underneath him, crossing his hands over his lap. He wonders if Phil ever did the same, next to a brother, looking up at his parents and waiting for his earliest instructions on how to make the ground move. \n</p><p>\n  Next to him, Phil sits down too, so close that their knees bump together.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;The thing is, I can&rsquo;t really teach you how to bend the way I do my usual students, but earthbending and firebending are pretty similar,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Your Master sent you to me to improve your control over your bending. In my experience, the best way to do that is to ground yourself.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  His brows furrow. &ldquo;How? I can&rsquo;t exactly feel the earth like you can.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;But you can focus on the world. Grounding yourself doesn&rsquo;t have to mean to the actual ground.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He reaches forward and rests a hand on Dan&rsquo;s knee, squeezing gently with a reassuring smile.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Just do your breathing again, and focus on how things sound, how they feel. Trust me when I say it can help.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to ask how he knows, what he knows about Dan&rsquo;s trouble with controlling his fire, but Phil squeezes his knee again and stands before he can utter a word. He walks across the circle, until he&rsquo;s standing outside the perimeter he drew, and turns back to smile. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Go ahead, breathe,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Are you going to watch me?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  If Dan were back home, he&rsquo;d hear the crackle of fire, feel the heaviness of humid heat on his skin.\n</p><p>\n  Here, he listens to the rustle of leaves through the trees, the distant squeals of children in the town. A train has come and gone since he sat down, and every now and then, he can hear Phil&rsquo;s footsteps, circling around him at a constant distance in a way that makes anxiety prickle along Dan&rsquo;s spine. \n</p><p>\n  He adjusts his hands on his thighs, sucks in another deep breath.\n</p><p>\n  The Earth Kingdom is hot, too, though it&rsquo;s more arid than the Fire Nation is. Dan&rsquo;s mouth can gone dry from the breaths he&rsquo;s taken. His palms are moist with sweat. When the wind picks up, specks of sand hit his face, just enough to make his skin sting.\n</p><p>\n  Part of him wants to move.\n</p><p>\n  He takes another deep breath, in through his nose, out through his mouth.\n</p><p>\n  His body feels heavy now, rooted to the ground. Even moving his hand to wipe the sweat from his palm feels like too much work. He&rsquo;s pretty sure his eyes will burn when he opens them, the desert sun still beating down on him as the afternoon drags on. \n</p><p>\n  A hand lands on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  He jumps. Phil&rsquo;s looking down at him, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Feel grounded?&rdquo; he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan clenches his fist. His fingers feel almost numb, but steady. &ldquo;Yeah, actually.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Then bend.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;What?&rdquo; says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tugs at the fabric of Dan&rsquo;s tunic, drawing him to his feet. &ldquo;Bend,&rdquo; he repeats. &ldquo;See how your control is now.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He steps away again, giving Dan a silent thumbs up from the sidelines as Dan adjusts his stance, lowering his center of balance, drawing his hands together in front of his chest. When he punches the air, a ball of flames erupts, flying forward until a pillar of stone rises to stop it.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Keep going!&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  So Dan does it again, with an open palm this time, so a stream of fire bursts forth. He can control it this time, whipping it towards the ground and letting it fizzle out upon contact.\n</p><p>\n  He does the same with his right hand before kicking forward, making another ball of flames that Phil stops with his earthbending.\n</p><p>\n  The flames still burn brighter, more violently than he&rsquo;d want, but when Dan plants both feet on the ground again, no sparks fizzle at his fingertips.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;That was great!&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan turns on his heel. Phil&rsquo;s grinning, so wide and happy it has some of the rush fading. His breathing slows. He feels himself smile, too.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;It helped,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It actually helped.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They have soup for dinner.\n</p><p>\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lester tell stories of Phil&rsquo;s childhood. They talk about when they moved into the city for the sake of Phil&rsquo;s training, and about moving back after the academy had been set up. They ask about Dan&rsquo;s life back in the Fire Nation, about his family, his Master, and how he&rsquo;s liking the Earth Kingdom. \n</p><p>\n  Phil asks if they can come back next week, and his mum assures him that they most certainly can as she draws him into a goodbye hug.\n</p><p>\n  And then they get on the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s emptier this time, just a few people dotting seats. Dan sits by the window, head resting against the wall as Phil slides into the seat next to him. Their knees knock together, their shoulders bumping. Dan may be wrong, but he feels like they&rsquo;re closer this time.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Was that too much?&rdquo; asks Phil, once the train has drawn away and the town has faded into the blur.\n</p><p>\n  Dan looks over. His smile feels sleepy. &ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;I just realized I probably should have warned you before taking you to my parents&rsquo; house.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Between them, Dan nudges their feet together, pressing himself closer to Phil. There&rsquo;s a strange urge to reach out, squeeze Phil&rsquo;s knee like he&rsquo;d done to Dan earlier, but he clenches his hand into a fist against his own thigh instead. It feels simpler that way.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;It was fun,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Tiring, but fun.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s responding smile is soft. &ldquo;You should nap. I&rsquo;ll wake you up when we get there.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still pressed together when Dan drifts off to sleep.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  The next week follows the same routine.\n</p><p>\n  They practice breathing, have lunch, and practice breathing again. Dan watches Phil host classes for young earthbenders in the afternoons, kids who accidentally slam rocks into the walls and raise pillars to the ceiling. It almost makes Dan feel better about his own lack of control as he tries to muffle his laughs against his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It makes him understand why his Master sent him to Phil, as Dan watches him steady young teenagers.\n</p><p>\n  They play games at night. Some nights it&rsquo;s Pai Sho, on a board that once belonged to Phil&rsquo;s grandfather, with the clumsy strategy of two people who&rsquo;ve really learned how to play. Others, it&rsquo;s cards, arranged on the table between them as they sip tea and share stories.\n</p><p>\n  One night, Dan introduces Phil to gambling like they do in the Fire Nation, though Phil refuses to bet on anything more important than who pays for lunch the next day.\n</p><p>\n  Phil tells him about his aunt who tailors clothing and his grandma who claimed to be psychic. Dan tells him about his younger brother who can&rsquo;t bend but plays Kuai Ball better than Dan ever could and his nana who&rsquo;s always tried to teach him balance, though he never seemed to learn. \n</p><p>\n  On the weekend, they go back to Phil&rsquo;s parents&rsquo;, meditating in a clearing before eating soup around the dining table.\n</p><p>\n  They sit on the train back home together, pressed close and staring out the same window.\n</p><p>\n  At the end of the night, Dan&rsquo;s hand hovers over his doorknob as he whispers: &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  The lights from outside allow him to see Phil&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; he says, and then slips into his bedroom.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try something different today.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s Monday morning, the sun high in the sky over Ba Sing Se.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I think we need to work on your balance, too,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;Watching you bend, you seem a little shaky. It could impact your control.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan picks at the belt tied around his waist. It&rsquo;s silly, he thinks, that he cheeks flush at the observation, as though he doesn&rsquo;t already know. When he was young, the force of bending would send him falling backwards sometimes, so he&rsquo;d scrape his palms and send his fire flying forward.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can be, uh, kind of clumsy. I blame the growth spurt.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  A smile cracks across Phil&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I can relate,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite clumsy myself.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re literally the most steady earthbender I know,&rdquo; says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s response is a laugh, quiet and happy and growing familiar. &ldquo;How many earthbenders do you know?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Uh.&rdquo; His cheeks get warmer. He can feel the morning sun hot against his right cheek, can see it gleaming in the corner of his vision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met a bunch of kids.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Some of them are probably steadier than me,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;In everyday life, at least. I only have balance when bending. I learned to ground myself for it.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Grounding has way too many definitions in earthbending.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s smile widens, even as he rolls his eyes. It makes Dan&rsquo;s chest go tight.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Just come here,&rdquo; says Phil\n</p><p>\n  Dan does.\n</p><p>\n  He ends up facing away from Phil, only a few inches between them.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Get into your bending stance,&rdquo; says Phil. He&rsquo;s so close, it&rsquo;s barely a whisper against Dan&rsquo;s ear. \n</p><p>\n  He didn&rsquo;t mean to be this close. It feels like it&rsquo;d be weird to step away now. Dan&rsquo;s not even sure he wants to. Having Phil&rsquo;s voice so close, he realizes, isn&rsquo;t uncomfortable. \n</p><p>\n  Not in the way he would have expected, at least. \n</p><p>\n  He bends his knees, settling onto his heels, bringing his hands in front of his chest. Every move starts from here, he learned when he was just a kid. His power is centered here, in the press of his fist to his palm, the balance of his frame over the ground.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; says Phil. \n</p><p>\n  Dan bites his lip, ignoring the goosebumps that rise along his spine.\n</p><p>\n  And then Phil&rsquo;s hands settle on his hips. Dan has to swallow to keep from making a noise, has to focus to keep his hands from falling to his sides.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tall,&rdquo; says Phil, like he doesn&rsquo;t notice a thing, &ldquo;So you need to lower your center of balance more than most people.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He presses against Dan&rsquo;s hips, gently, lowering him ever so slightly.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Is that better?&rdquo; he asks.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Do you feel steadier?&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. He doesn&rsquo;t feel steadier at all. Even his insides feel shaky now, his pulse stuttering where it thuds in his throat, his fingers quivering as he keeps them clenched in a fist. Phil&rsquo;s breath is still warm against the back of his neck, his hands still resting at Dan&rsquo;s sides, as though waiting to adjust him more, if needed.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I, uh, I think so?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil draws back then. Dan counts enough footsteps to reach edge of the room. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Try to bend, then,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan hesitates before shifting his weight, leaning back so he can kick his foot up and make a ball of flames fly through the air.\n</p><p>\n  He feels like he might fall over, like he did when he was little.\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s not the fire&rsquo;s fault this time.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Phil buys lunch that day.\n</p><p>\n  They sit across from each other at a table in the corner of the room, with bowls of noodles and cups of tea. For the first time in a long time, they don&rsquo;t really talk.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can still feel the phantom press of Phil&rsquo;s palms against his body.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to imagine it lasting longer.\n</p><p>\n  Under the table, their legs brush together. Over the edge of his cup, he can see Phil&rsquo;s cheeks go pink.\n</p><p>\n  He tries even harder not to wonder if Phil&rsquo;s thinking about it, too.\n</p><p>\n  They slip out of their seats at the same time, and fall into step on the walk between the restaurant and the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Their shoulders press together.\n</p><p>\n  Dan doesn&rsquo;t pull away.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan says it on a Thursday night, when the sky has fallen so dark that their lazy game of cards is lit up only by the torch he lit earlier. He&rsquo;s curled up on his side on Phil&rsquo;s living room floor, splayed over cushions they dragged in from the academy.\n</p><p>\n  Phil throws a card into the space between them.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  He fidgets with his own cards for a second, before resting a card with the earthbending emblem in its center down. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Has it been weird, spending so much time with me suddenly?&rdquo; says Dan. &ldquo;I mean, you must have had a life before this.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, muffling it with a sip of his cherry-berry lemonade. &ldquo;Debatable.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He shrugs. &ldquo;I just, didn&rsquo;t have much to do, I guess? I don&rsquo;t have many friends,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite the introvert, I guess.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says Dan. &ldquo;I, uh, same.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s next card has the airbending symbol on it. Dan&rsquo;s has fire.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Can I ask you something else?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil giggles. The firelight flickers across his cheekbones and makes the yellow flecks in his eyes stand out. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Has it felt, I don&rsquo;t know, intrusive to have me here?&rdquo; says Dan. &ldquo;You know, since you&rsquo;re an introvert.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He hums, and rests a card with another firebending emblem into the game. &ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil looks up. He&rsquo;s smiling, soft and sweet, the kind reserved for quiet nights in, rather than the excitement of bending. His finger is tracing the edge of his playing cards, and though it&rsquo;s been days, Dan can still feel the foreign touch of Phil&rsquo;s hands on his hips.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think too hard about why.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;I feel like we, I don&rsquo;t know, work well together. It doesn&rsquo;t really feel like your a stranger, or even a student, in my house, you know?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows, nodding. He wonders if the tinge of pink on Phil&rsquo;s cheeks is a blush or from the orange of the fire.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I know. It feels like we&rsquo;re &hellip; friends?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles wider. &ldquo;Yeah, friends.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  That weekend, they stand in the clearing outside Phil&rsquo;s hometown again.\n</p><p>\n  Dan watches the last of his flames die out, crashing against a pillar Phil makes rise and fall in the span of a minute. He&rsquo;s lunging forward, palm splayed wide, thrust in front of him. His chest is heaving. He&rsquo;s pretty sure it&rsquo;s the longest stretch he&rsquo;s bent for.\n</p><p>\n  The longest he&rsquo;s gone without losing control.\n</p><p>\n  He settles back, standing up straight, watching the sand blow in the wind before him.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing really well,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can hear his smile before he sees it.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Thanks to you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  There&rsquo;s a rush of earth as Phil smoothes out the circle he&rsquo;s redrawn on the ground. By this point in his training, Dan&rsquo;s supposed to try to kill his fire before it reaches outside the boundary, and he usually manages.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;That was all you, mate,&rdquo; says Phil. He reaches the middle of the circle, bumping their shoulders together. &ldquo;At this rate, you&rsquo;ll be ready to go back to the Fire Nation soon.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows around a bittersweet rush in his chest at the thought.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n  They start walking towards the town, shoulders still standing side by side. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having dinner with your parents again, right?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil grins. &ldquo;We are. But, fair warning, if it&rsquo;s not great it&rsquo;s because my mum is trying to follow a Fire Nation recipe tonight,&rdquo; he says. He looks up at Dan, their arms brushing, his face so very close. &ldquo;She said she wanted to do something to remind you of home, since you&rsquo;ve been here so long.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan feels his face flush as he mumbles: &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  The responding laugh is pressed against his shoulder, and sounds almost like a giggle. It makes Dan&rsquo;s cheeks go even hotter.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Thanks for the warning,&rdquo; he says, because he can&rsquo;t think of anything else. &ldquo;Now I can figure out how to thank her before she tells me.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They go home that night with leftover bread.\n</p><p>\n  Mrs. Lester hugged them both goodbye, whispering to Dan that she hoped her rice wasn&rsquo;t too different from what they serve in the Fire Nation. Mr. Lester had shaken his hand with a kind smile. They&rsquo;d shoved a bag into Phil&rsquo;s arms and sent them to catch the train back to the city.\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s another quiet ride, pressed together, watching the now-familiar desert landscape.\n</p><p>\n  When they get home, Dan whispers: &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s smile is crooked, warm even in the darkness, as he says it too.\n</p><p>\n  Dan slips into his bed, tucking himself under his blankets, and wonders when he started thinking about Phil&rsquo;s house as home.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He wakes up with a hand on his shoulder.\n</p><p>\n  It takes him a moment to realize Phil&rsquo;s shaking him, saying his name over and over by his ear. And another beat too long to process the crackling of fire sounding loud, too close to his ear.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;s sitting up. Phil&rsquo;s dragging him out of his bed, away from the drapes that Dan apparently lit on fire. In his sleep.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;\n  <i>\n    Fuck.\n  </i>\n  &rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil waves a hand. From the stone walls rise a little bubble of earth. Dan realizes only when Phil returns the room to normal that it choked out the fire on the now-charred curtains.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Dan says again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I thought that stopped happening.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  There&rsquo;s another tug at his shoulder. Phil&rsquo;s still clutching at his sleep shirt, still trying to pull him away from his bed, away from where the flames had blazed. Phil&rsquo;s hair, Dan realizes, is a mess atop his head. His eyes are too wide, a little unfocused. The fire must have woken him up.\n</p><p>\n  Dan stumbles to his feet, because Phil obviously wants him too.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn&rsquo;t expect Phil to wrap his arms around him, hold him close.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You scared me,&rdquo; he says, the words muffled against Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you sleep firebend?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t happened in a while,&rdquo; Dan hears himself say. It must be the shock that has him being so honest. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the way Phil&rsquo;s pressed against him. &ldquo;I&ndash; we were working on my control back in the Fire Nation and that, at least, had gone away. I thought it was safe.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil squeezes him even tighter. &ldquo;You are safe,&rdquo; he mumbles.\n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s pretty sure Phil&rsquo;s trying to reassure himself.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They curl up together in Phil&rsquo;s bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan almost protested. Only the drapes were burned, after all. The bed&rsquo;s fine. But Phil&rsquo;s still clinging to him, and Dan likes the warm press of someone against his chest.\n</p><p>\n  Of \n  <i>\n    Phil \n  </i>\n  against his chest. \n</p><p>\n  The sky&rsquo;s started to swirl in shades of pink outside. It must be bleeding into morning, the time when they&rsquo;d drag themselves out of bed to have breakfast before doing breathing exercises in the academy. This is comfier, though. It&rsquo;s better.\n</p><p>\n  It feels like Phil&rsquo;s practicing breathing exercises to stay calm. \n</p><p>\n  So Dan slides his hand into Phil&rsquo;s hair.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, I promise,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You put out the fire and it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods, pressing himself tighter against Dan&rsquo;s chest as though the louder echo of his heartbeat is reassuring. Maybe it is. Dan&rsquo;s fingers, now rubbing gentle circles against the back of Phil&rsquo;s head, seem to be. Some of the tension bleeds from Phil&rsquo;s shoulders.\n</p><p>\n  It feels less like a panicked hug, suddenly. More like cuddling.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Can I tell you something?&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles at the ceiling. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You know how I asked if you had anxiety when we first met?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; whispers Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s fingers drift up along Dan&rsquo;s side, gentle, almost shy. They&rsquo;ve only ever really touched during lessons, haphazard adjustments of Dan&rsquo;s stance, of his breathing. This isn&rsquo;t that. Dan knows it isn&rsquo;t that when Phil&rsquo;s hand presses flat against the splay of his ribs as though to feel the rise and fall of his breathing.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I used to have anxiety,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;I was terrified of the city, didn&rsquo;t talk to people much. It&rsquo;s part of why I&rsquo;m so good at teaching control. I had to, you know, relearn it for my own bending.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s hand clenches against the back of Phil&rsquo;s head. It must be comforting, because Phil hums, nestling even closer to him.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;One of my friends died,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;In a bending accident. Freak thing, but I was so scared.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Dan whispers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible. I&ndash; I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say anything.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He tilts his head up, still pressed against Dan&rsquo;s shoulder, still so very close. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I just wanted you to know,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&ndash; you scared me.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Dan reaches up with his free hand, resting it on top of Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You can be scared. You don&rsquo;t always need to be in control, you know.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Half a smile quirks at the corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth. It&rsquo;s enough.\n</p><p>\n  Dan keeps holding him.\n</p><p>\n  And that&rsquo;s enough, too.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  It takes a few days for them to recover. \n</p><p>\n  They don&rsquo;t practice bending during those days. There&rsquo;s breathing exercises for a little while, and then just life. Phil takes Dan shopping the first day, to some of the nicer stores in Ba Sing Se, and then to lunch at a restaurant he loves but rarely goes to.\n</p><p>\n  He buys new drapes that day.\n</p><p>\n  Dan still doesn&rsquo;t sleep in his own bed.\n</p><p>\n  But when he curls up against Phil&rsquo;s back at night, he doesn&rsquo;t care to complain.\n</p><p>\n  Phil still teaches his classes in the afternoon, going through rudimentary earthbending while Dan sits in the corner and watches, not bothering to hide his smile.\n</p><p>\n  They play Pai Sho in the evenings.\n</p><p>\n  And on Thursday, when they go to bed, Dan doesn&rsquo;t question it when Phil leads him to his bedroom, so they can curl up side by side again. \n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Do you know what you were dreaming about? That night?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan cracks one eye open. They&rsquo;re supposed to be breathing, balancing on one leg, but Phil&rsquo;s standing in front of him with a curious furrow to his brow, both feet flat on the ground.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;The night of the fire?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil nods.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Not really. I didn&rsquo;t even remember that day, to be honest,&rdquo; says Dan. He lets himself stand normally again, and stops the rhythmic counting of his breaths. &ldquo;I was thinking about going back to the Fire Nation when I fell asleep though, so maybe that.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  It feels wrong to admit. His cheeks go warm. Phil&rsquo;s brows furrow further.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Do you not want to go back?&rdquo; he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, really. I like it there. I just&ndash;&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Just what?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He feels himself smile, watching Phil mirror it. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I just like it here, a lot. Uh, with you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s smile goes brighter. It seems to shine in his eyes. Dan feels it, hot and fluttery, in his stomach.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I like you here, too.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They go back to the clearing on Sunday.\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s the first time Dan&rsquo;s actually firebent since the incident, in a desert without drapes or duvets to light aflame. He&rsquo;s almost surprised to find his control hasn&rsquo;t dimmed. He can still stop his flames before they reach the perimeter, can still keep them from blazing too bright.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing great,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He doesn&rsquo;t bother to erase the circle before stepping towards Dan this time. His hands land on Dan&rsquo;s shoulders, rubbing gently at the muscle there.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re less tense,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re breathing well. And you&rsquo;re in tune with nature more. You&rsquo;re doing &hellip; good.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan grins. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s response is a smile. He looks up, his eyes bright, gleaming in the desert sunlight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  His hands are still on Dan&rsquo;s shoulders, holding on too tightly. For a moment, it looks like he might cry. Dan blinks against the realization that he might, too.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Why does it feel like you&rsquo;re saying goodbye?&rdquo; he whispers.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I could be?&rdquo; says Phil, voice shaky. &ldquo;You could go back now, finish your training with your Master. You have control.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He doesn&rsquo;t let go. Dan reaches for him, just in case. His heart is racing, aching.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t want to say goodbye?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles at that, soft and hopeful. &ldquo;Then can I do something?&rdquo; he asks.\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles back. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  The hand on his left shoulder drifts, cradling the back of his neck so Phil can draw him forward. Their smiles meet. Dan&rsquo;s eyes drift closed.\n</p><p>\n  And they&rsquo;re kissing.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  The train back home is almost empty that night.\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s head is resting against his shoulder, his hand on Dan&rsquo;s forearm. They don&rsquo;t look out the window. Dan&rsquo;s too busy wondering if he should hold Phil&rsquo;s hand, if that&rsquo;s something they do now that they&rsquo;ve kissed.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; says Phil, &ldquo;That maybe you don&rsquo;t have to go back to the Fire Nation right away?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil hums. &ldquo;You could stay with me. The war&rsquo;s over, there&rsquo;s firebending Masters in Ba Sing Se. I know it&rsquo;s not your Master, but you could try to finish your training,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And we could set up your old room to be a guest room. I know it&rsquo;s a long trip, but if your family wanted to visit, they could stay in there.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his head. Dan turns to catch how blue his eyes look in the low light of the night train.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;d want it back, of course.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan chuckles. Without looking away, he slips his hand into Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want it back.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s teeth catch at his lip when he smiles. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll stay? At least for a little while?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  It&rsquo;s Dan that leans down to kiss him this time.\n</p><p>\n  And it&rsquo;s him who pulls away to mumble: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He doesn&rsquo;t want the day to end when they get home. Neither does Phil, apparently, as he suggests they have tea before bed.\n</p><p>\n  Dan warms the kettle with his firebending, standing in the middle of Phil&rsquo;s house of stone. They sip tea on the sofa without any games to play, without any distractions.\n</p><p>\n  And when they slip into bed, curled up under a dark sky and Poe the potted plant, now resting on Phil&rsquo;s windowsill, they kiss goodnight.\n</p>",

She\u2019s probably taking her time admiring the gigantic wreath Phil\u2019s hung on their front door.</p><p>He hovers in the entrance to the foyer until the chime sounds, then counts to five before moving towards the door. He breathes deeply, pushing down the bundle of nerves in his sternum. When he opens the door, she\u2019s smiling up at him, her brown curls tousled from the December wind. She\u2019s holding a bottle of red wine in one hand and Colin\u2019s leash in the other, and the white cashmere scarf Dan had given her for her birthday this year is peeking out of her coat.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, Merry Christmas, darling,\u201d she says brightly. He takes the wine from her as she unleashes Colin, placing it on the small table in the entryway. Colin jumps up at his legs relentlessly until Dan bends to pet and coo at him, rustling the tiny jingle bell tied to his collar. He quickly abandons Dan in favor of seeking out attention from the rest of the houseguests, leaving Dan alone with his mum.</p><p>She sheds her coat and various winter accessories, hanging everything neatly on the row of hooks to the left of the door. Dan always thinks that she looks exactly like she did the last time he saw her, even though that can\u2019t possibly be true. But she\u2019s got the same haircut and the same shade of pink lipstick and smells like the same pinewood candles she\u2019s been burning in her house since he and Adrian were old enough to know not to touch them, so he feels like he\u2019s justified.</p><p>She holds her arms out for him, and he folds his long body in half around her. There\u2019s a burst of laughter from the lounge as they hug, and Dan suddenly feels very grateful that he asked her to come today. They\u2019ve both worked hard to let go of so much of their messy past, of grudges and anger and apathy held between them, that the warmth of this moment feels like the beginnings of some sort of cosmic reward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Mum,\u201d he says, because he\u2019s trying to put his thoughts into words more often.</p><p>She squeezes tight around his middle before pulling back to look at him. \u201cMe too,\u201d she says, smiling. She presses up on her tiptoes to tidy his fringe and he ducks out of reach on instinct, the same way he\u2019s been doing since he was a kid.</p><p>\u201cMum! None of that, fix your own fringe instead, you look like you took a tornado to get here instead of a train,\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cOi, it\u2019s Christmas, be nice to your mother,\u201d she chides, poking a finger into his side even as she uses her other hand to smooth out her curls.</p><p>\u201cSorry, mum,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cC\u2019mon into the kitchen. Kath\u2019s already been breathing down Phil\u2019s neck for the last hour, but he needs all the help he can get, honestly.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and steps ahead of him, and Dan moves to follow before doubling back to grab the wine she\u2019d brought. He hears the low murmur of chatter from the other room burst into a chorus of \u201cHello!\u201d and \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d as his mum makes her way in, and the joyous sound of it settles some of the nerves still fluttering in his chest.</p><p>It\u2019s not often that him and Phil get their families together in one place, too little time and too much distance tending to squash any plans they make. It\u2019d been Phil who\u2019d suggested that they host a joint Christmas this year, to celebrate the new house and the bulk of the renovations being done and, by proxy, the true beginning of the next chapter of their lives. Dan had only resisted minutely before Phil had won him over, arguing that this year for the first time, they have the space and the time and the resources to make it truly wonderful.</p><p>Kath is tying up the strings of an apron around his mum when he finally shakes himself from his thoughts and rounds the corner into the kitchen. He catches the tail end of their conversation as he sets down the wine on the counter.</p><p>\u201c - and then, you\u2019ll never believe this, Karen, he calls me two nights ago to ask if I <i> really </i> needed almonds for the pies, because he forgot them at the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i> Dan </i> forgot them,\u201d Phil interjects, looking accusatorially over at him, a small smile playing at his lips.</p><p>\u201cOi,\u201d Dan says, coming to his own defense, \u201c<i> you </i> were holding the list when we were at Sainsbury\u2019s, I was only working under your instructions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s <i> your </i> fault for letting me hold the list, then!\u201d Phil argues.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with him there, Dan,\u201d Karen says. Kath hums along in agreement, adding, \u201cHusbands should never be left in charge of the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Nigel says from the dining table, where he\u2019s sat hunched over the spring gardening blueprints he\u2019d brought along.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know it\u2019s true!&ldquo; Kath replies, pointing her wooden spoon at him victoriously. Nigel just waves her away with a smile, turning back to his drawings.</p><p>\n  <b>*~\u00a0two: Adrian\u00a0*~</b>\n</p><p>They\u2019d made an agreement, between all the siblings, really - no tweeting, no Instagram stories, no pictures that won\u2019t be kept just for them. It\u2019s the concession Dan had made in order to be able to convince Adrian to come to their house for the first time now since they\u2019d moved, for the first time in years, actually. A pact formed between the two of them over a handful of texts, that they could both show up for their mum this year. It\u2019s a bit forced and a bit cheesy but they\u2019re both well and truly adults now, and so a temper tantrum over where they\u2019d spend the holidays just doesn\u2019t feel right anymore.</p><p>Dan \u00a0finds himself lingering in the foyer for the second time that day. He turns his phone end over end in his hands, trying to soothe the restless feeling in his chest. He unlocks it to reread Adrian\u2019s text again, the one from 25 minutes ago saying that he was 20 mins away. Dan sighs and darkens the screen, resuming his pacing across the small space. He jumps when he hears the slam of a car door, followed by a low voice muttering as the sounds of the car engine fade away. He thinks he can make out the phrases <i> so much fucking snow here </i> and <i> why couldn\u2019t they have moved somewhere warm, </i>and so Dan\u2019s actually smiling a bit by the time the doorbell rings. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>They really do look so much alike. Dan sees it more and more the older they get, as Adrian disappears and reemerges through the second and third puberties that he himself is so familiar with.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Adrian says, and Dan startles at the realization of how long it\u2019s been since he heard his brother\u2019s voice in person. He still watches Adrian\u2019s videos, quietly and well in the background of the rest of his life. His therapist has convinced him that it\u2019s good for him, to watch and to hear his thoughts and opinions, even if Dan doesn\u2019t always agree. Even if it makes him angry sometimes.</p><p>It\u2019s a different thing to have Adrian standing in front of him on his doorstep, a single backpack slung over his shoulder and three small, neatly-wrapped packages stacked in his gloveless hands. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dan parrots back, the cold wind outside blowing some snow onto his ankles.</p><p>Adrian smiles, just a little. \u201cYou gonna let me in, or do I have to whistle for Colin to go on the attack?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes but steps back to let his brother through the door, taking the gifts from him while he shrugs out of his coat. &quot;Yes, what an incredibly vicious beast you have at your disposal.&rdquo;</p><p>As if on cue, Colin comes barreling through the hallway and collides at full speed with Adrian&rsquo;s shins, sliding all along the way on the hardwood floors. Adrian laughs and picks him up, letting the dog lick across his cheeks and forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Ew, you two are gross,&rdquo; Dan says, putting on a face of mock disgust, as though he hadn&rsquo;t been lying on the floor letting Colin do the same to him not ten minutes earlier.</p><p>Adrian rolls his eyes in a perfect replica of Dan from two minutes ago, bending down to release a squirming Colin from his arms. &ldquo;Uh, Merry Christmas,&rdquo; he says as he straightens up, nodding to the packages Dan had taken from him. &ldquo;The bottom one&rsquo;s for you and Phil, and the other two are for Mum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Uh - thanks,&rdquo; Dan says, watching Adrian toe off his snowy boots and kick them into the closet. He flexes his fingers around the boxes he&rsquo;s holding, trying to unstick himself from his anxieties. <i> Put your thoughts into words, Dan </i>, his therapist&rsquo;s voice says in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he starts, shifting the presents to balance in his left hand, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to see you. I&rsquo;m happy you could come.&rdquo;</p><p>Adrian manages to only look taken aback for a moment before relaxing his face into a small smile. &ldquo;Yeah. Me too, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>A pause. Something slots into place in his heart, everyone he loves under the same roof, warm and happy and safe. It&rsquo;s right, that it should be this way.</p><p>&ldquo;C'mon, I think Mum put the kettle on for you as soon as she heard the doorbell,&rdquo; Dan says.</p><p>The chorus of greetings starts up again as they round the corner into the kitchen together, and Dan veers off to the side to lay the presents Adrian had brought under the tree. When he turns back, his brother is already stood at the kitchen island, a cup of tea cradled in his hands and having his collar straightened by their mum. Martyn claps him on the shoulder as he moves around him to pour a cup for Cornelia, who&rsquo;s nodding along attentively as Adrian starts to recap his latest biking trip.</p><p>He catches Phil\u2019s eye from across the room as he stands there taking in the scene. Phil\u2019s leaning on his elbows on the kitchen island, a bit of flour on his jumper and a soft smile on his lips. Phil lets his gaze drift around the room with intention: to the counter cluttered with pieces of their festive feast, to their holiday decorations both old and new, to the many people now gathering around the dining table, carrying plates and silverware and bottles of toasting champagne. A deep sense of satisfaction settles over Dan as Phil\u2019s eyes land on him once again. They did it.</p><p>(Together, the way they do everything else.)</p>",

She\u2019s probably taking her time admiring the gigantic wreath Phil\u2019s hung on their front door.</p><p>He hovers in the entrance to the foyer until the chime sounds, then counts to five before moving towards the door. He breathes deeply, pushing down the bundle of nerves in his sternum. When he opens the door, she\u2019s smiling up at him, her brown curls tousled from the December wind. She\u2019s holding a bottle of red wine in one hand and Colin\u2019s leash in the other, and the white cashmere scarf Dan had given her for her birthday this year is peeking out of her coat.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, Merry Christmas, darling,\u201d she says brightly. He takes the wine from her as she unleashes Colin, placing it on the small table in the entryway. Colin jumps up at his legs relentlessly until Dan bends to pet and coo at him, rustling the tiny jingle bell tied to his collar. He quickly abandons Dan in favor of seeking out attention from the rest of the houseguests, leaving Dan alone with his mum.</p><p>She sheds her coat and various winter accessories, hanging everything neatly on the row of hooks to the left of the door. Dan always thinks that she looks exactly like she did the last time he saw her, even though that can\u2019t possibly be true. But she\u2019s got the same haircut and the same shade of pink lipstick and smells like the same pinewood candles she\u2019s been burning in her house since he and Adrian were old enough to know not to touch them, so he feels like he\u2019s justified.</p><p>She holds her arms out for him, and he folds his long body in half around her. There\u2019s a burst of laughter from the lounge as they hug, and Dan suddenly feels very grateful that he asked her to come today. They\u2019ve both worked hard to let go of so much of their messy past, of grudges and anger and apathy held between them, that the warmth of this moment feels like the beginnings of some sort of cosmic reward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Mum,\u201d he says, because he\u2019s trying to put his thoughts into words more often.</p><p>She squeezes tight around his middle before pulling back to look at him. \u201cMe too,\u201d she says, smiling. She presses up on her tiptoes to tidy his fringe and he ducks out of reach on instinct, the same way he\u2019s been doing since he was a kid.</p><p>\u201cMum! None of that, fix your own fringe instead, you look like you took a tornado to get here instead of a train,\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cOi, it\u2019s Christmas, be nice to your mother,\u201d she chides, poking a finger into his side even as she uses her other hand to smooth out her curls.</p><p>\u201cSorry, mum,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cC\u2019mon into the kitchen. Kath\u2019s already been breathing down Phil\u2019s neck for the last hour, but he needs all the help he can get, honestly.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and steps ahead of him, and Dan moves to follow before doubling back to grab the wine she\u2019d brought. He hears the low murmur of chatter from the other room burst into a chorus of \u201cHello!\u201d and \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d as his mum makes her way in, and the joyous sound of it settles some of the nerves still fluttering in his chest.</p><p>It\u2019s not often that him and Phil get their families together in one place, too little time and too much distance tending to squash any plans they make. It\u2019d been Phil who\u2019d suggested that they host a joint Christmas this year, to celebrate the new house and the bulk of the renovations being done and, by proxy, the true beginning of the next chapter of their lives. Dan had only resisted minutely before Phil had won him over, arguing that this year for the first time, they have the space and the time and the resources to make it truly wonderful.</p><p>Kath is tying up the strings of an apron around his mum when he finally shakes himself from his thoughts and rounds the corner into the kitchen. He catches the tail end of their conversation as he sets down the wine on the counter.</p><p>\u201c - and then, you\u2019ll never believe this, Karen, he calls me two nights ago to ask if I <i> really </i> needed almonds for the pies, because he forgot them at the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i> Dan </i> forgot them,\u201d Phil interjects, looking accusatorially over at him, a small smile playing at his lips.</p><p>\u201cOi,\u201d Dan says, coming to his own defense, \u201c<i> you </i> were holding the list when we were at Sainsbury\u2019s, I was only working under your instructions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s <i> your </i> fault for letting me hold the list, then!\u201d Phil argues.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with him there, Dan,\u201d Karen says. Kath hums along in agreement, adding, \u201cHusbands should never be left in charge of the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Nigel says from the dining table, where he\u2019s sat hunched over the spring gardening blueprints he\u2019d brought along.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know it\u2019s true!\u201c Kath replies, pointing her wooden spoon at him victoriously. Nigel just waves her away with a smile, turning back to his drawings.</p><p>\n  <b>*~\u00a0two: Adrian\u00a0*~</b>\n</p><p>They\u2019d made an agreement, between all the siblings, really - no tweeting, no Instagram stories, no pictures that won\u2019t be kept just for them. It\u2019s the concession Dan had made in order to be able to convince Adrian to come to their house for the first time now since they\u2019d moved, for the first time in years, actually. A pact formed between the two of them over a handful of texts, that they could both show up for their mum this year. It\u2019s a bit forced and a bit cheesy but they\u2019re both well and truly adults now, and so a temper tantrum over where they\u2019d spend the holidays just doesn\u2019t feel right anymore.</p><p>Dan \u00a0finds himself lingering in the foyer for the second time that day. He turns his phone end over end in his hands, trying to soothe the restless feeling in his chest. He unlocks it to reread Adrian\u2019s text again, the one from 25 minutes ago saying that he was 20 mins away. Dan sighs and darkens the screen, resuming his pacing across the small space. He jumps when he hears the slam of a car door, followed by a low voice muttering as the sounds of the car engine fade away. He thinks he can make out the phrases <i> so much fucking snow here </i> and <i> why couldn\u2019t they have moved somewhere warm, </i>and so Dan\u2019s actually smiling a bit by the time the doorbell rings. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>They really do look so much alike. Dan sees it more and more the older they get, as Adrian disappears and reemerges through the second and third puberties that he himself is so familiar with.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Adrian says, and Dan startles at the realization of how long it\u2019s been since he heard his brother\u2019s voice in person. He still watches Adrian\u2019s videos, quietly and well in the background of the rest of his life. His therapist has convinced him that it\u2019s good for him, to watch and to hear his thoughts and opinions, even if Dan doesn\u2019t always agree. Even if it makes him angry sometimes.</p><p>It\u2019s a different thing to have Adrian standing in front of him on his doorstep, a single backpack slung over his shoulder and three small, neatly-wrapped packages stacked in his gloveless hands. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dan parrots back, the cold wind outside blowing some snow onto his ankles.</p><p>Adrian smiles, just a little. \u201cYou gonna let me in, or do I have to whistle for Colin to go on the attack?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes but steps back to let his brother through the door, taking the gifts from him while he shrugs out of his coat. \"Yes, what an incredibly vicious beast you have at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Colin comes barreling through the hallway and collides at full speed with Adrian\u2019s shins, sliding all along the way on the hardwood floors. Adrian laughs and picks him up, letting the dog lick across his cheeks and forehead.</p><p>\u201cEw, you two are gross,\u201d Dan says, putting on a face of mock disgust, as though he hadn\u2019t been lying on the floor letting Colin do the same to him not ten minutes earlier.</p><p>Adrian rolls his eyes in a perfect replica of Dan from two minutes ago, bending down to release a squirming Colin from his arms. \u201cUh, Merry Christmas,\u201d he says as he straightens up, nodding to the packages Dan had taken from him. \u201cThe bottom one\u2019s for you and Phil, and the other two are for Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Uh - thanks,\u201d Dan says, watching Adrian toe off his snowy boots and kick them into the closet. He flexes his fingers around the boxes he\u2019s holding, trying to unstick himself from his anxieties. <i> Put your thoughts into words, Dan </i>, his therapist\u2019s voice says in his head.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he starts, shifting the presents to balance in his left hand, \u201cit\u2019s good to see you. I\u2019m happy you could come.\u201d</p><p>Adrian manages to only look taken aback for a moment before relaxing his face into a small smile. \u201cYeah. Me too, Dan.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Something slots into place in his heart, everyone he loves under the same roof, warm and happy and safe. It\u2019s right, that it should be this way.</p><p>\u201cC'mon, I think Mum put the kettle on for you as soon as she heard the doorbell,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>The chorus of greetings starts up again as they round the corner into the kitchen together, and Dan veers off to the side to lay the presents Adrian had brought under the tree. When he turns back, his brother is already stood at the kitchen island, a cup of tea cradled in his hands and having his collar straightened by their mum. Martyn claps him on the shoulder as he moves around him to pour a cup for Cornelia, who\u2019s nodding along attentively as Adrian starts to recap his latest biking trip.</p><p>He catches Phil\u2019s eye from across the room as he stands there taking in the scene. Phil\u2019s leaning on his elbows on the kitchen island, a bit of flour on his jumper and a soft smile on his lips. Phil lets his gaze drift around the room with intention: to the counter cluttered with pieces of their festive feast, to their holiday decorations both old and new, to the many people now gathering around the dining table, carrying plates and silverware and bottles of toasting champagne. A deep sense of satisfaction settles over Dan as Phil\u2019s eyes land on him once again. They did it.</p><p>(Together, the way they do everything else.)</p>",

The only good part about English class so far is that he doesn\u2019t have a textbook to carry around with him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His tutor smiles, kind. \n</p><p>\n  All the staff here seem too kind. Dan kind of wishes they were scary. That would make it easier to hate them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you have a class now?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan we talk for a moment, then?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his hands from his bag. Walking into his tutorial today had already been dreadful. The heavy feeling he\u2019d been carrying in his chest since a few days ago comes back. He settles back into his seat, listening to every other student leave the room with rustling papers and loud footsteps. \n</p><p>\n  The doors at the uni are too heavy. They always fall closed with a loud thud.\n</p><p>\n  His tutor comes towards him only after the last student\u2019s left. Nathan, he told them to call him during the first tutorial. Calling people with actual PhDs by their first name still feels foreign on Dan\u2019s tongue, though. \n</p><p>\n  He sits down across from Dan, still smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m sure you saw your grade on the first essay,\u201d he says. \n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. The pressure in his chest is worse. \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Nathan nods. \u201cAs you know, a 36% is a failing grade.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI know,\u201d says Dan. \u201cAm I\u2013\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He cuts himself off. Asking if he\u2019s in trouble sounds stupid. He\u2019s supposed to be an adult now.\n</p><p>\n  Supposedly.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan shakes his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re okay. There\u2019ll be opportunities to bring your grade up,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, the professor is working with the university to help students who are struggling. We\u2019re trying to match students up with student tutors. Are you interested?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He isn\u2019t, not really. But Dan nods anyway.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan smiles, again. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll email you once I know the details, okay?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan just nods dumbly, slumped back in his seat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re free to go,\u201d says Nathan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. He stumbles to his feet, slings his backpack over his shoulder, and rushes out the door. \n</p><p>\n  He has almost an hour left before his metaphysics lecture.\n</p><p>\n  And he really needs coffee.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He gets the email with the details on a Tuesday.\n</p><p>\n  A few hours later, he gets another email from a guy called Phil that\u2019s a little less formal, a little more nerdy. It\u2019s almost enough to put Dan at ease.\n</p><p>\n  He reads it sitting in his ethics tutorial, waiting for the class to start.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hello,\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    My name\u2019s Phil and I\u2019m going to be your tutor for ENGL10021. I\u2019m a third year student doing English Language and Linguistics, by the way. I\u2019ll be on campus tonight if you want to meet up. Let me know!\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Phil ^.^\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  His brain feels numb when he leaves the tutorial. \n</p><p>\n  Ethics is confusing. His brain is all muddled. There\u2019s an essay coming up and the thought of it has his breaths coming quicker, tighter, a little too desperate. Dan clutches the straps of his bag and rushes down the stairs, almost stumbling over his own feet.\n</p><p>\n  He needs more coffee.\n</p><p>\n  Not that it fixes anything.\n</p><p>\n  Dan ends up at Starbucks, one near campus that\u2019s always too full. Someone pulls the door open. Dan rushes in before it falls closed. He feels jittery. His heart\u2019s beating too fast.\n</p><p>\n  He takes two steps into the store before realizing he\u2019s not paying attention. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cFucking \n  <i>\n    shit.\n  </i>\n  \u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan blinks. He\u2019s standing still, suddenly, and there\u2019s a boy standing in front of him, staring with wide eyes. His shirt is stained, wet and sticking to his skin.\n</p><p>\n  It takes Dan a moment to realize he\u2019s drenched in the shit, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re fucking going, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2013\u201d says the boy. He looks almost defensive, but it fades into something softer. \u201cSorry, I will. You should, too, though.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Bitterness flares, angry, in Dan\u2019s chest, but he doesn\u2019t argue. The boy lingers there for a moment. He has black hair, cutting across his forehead in a fringe that mirrors Dan\u2019s, and his eyes are still just a little too wide.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI, uh, have a lecture,\u201d the boy blurts. His coffee \u2014 iced, thankfully \u2014 is half empty, the plastic lid hanging off the straw, but he doesn\u2019t bother to fix it before leaving.\n</p><p>\n  Dan leaves without getting coffee.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  His leg is bouncing when he sits down at the library.\n</p><p>\n  The floor, Green 2 because it\u2019s the only social one in the main library, is full of people chatting with their friends and Dan feels stupid, sitting at a table by himself. He didn\u2019t even have time to go back to his room to pick up his English books. \n</p><p>\n  He should have gotten coffee before coming, he thinks. It\u2019s the only thing keeping him going by this point.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDan?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He jumps, swivels in his chair and\u2013\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck, please don\u2019t say you\u2019re Phil.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The boy standing there offers half a smile. \u201cSorry to disappoint?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s leg starts bouncing again. His chest feels too tight. He tries to remember the topics for his ethics essay to distract himself, but all that does is make his breaths come faster, his mind go a little more hazy around the edges. He doesn\u2019t want to think about philosophy.\n</p><p>\n  Uni\u2019s making him not want to think about anything.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He forces his eyes open. Phil\u2019s sitting across from him now, his bag on the table. There\u2019s a coffee-coloured stain on his shirt.\n</p><p>\n  Dan helped put it there.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI can\u2019t fail this fucking class,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t let me fail.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil frowns. \u201cWhy would I let you fail?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs, motioning vaguely towards Phil\u2019s chest. He\u2019s still not breathing properly.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh, this?\u201d Phil\u2019s smile quirks wider, happier, a little more crooked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll get my mum to wash it tonight and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He sounds so genuine that Dan manages to stop jittering for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNow, tell me about yourself?\u201d says Phil. \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan manages half a smile back. \u201cPhilosophy,\u201d he says. \u201cSince English clearly isn\u2019t my strong suit.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, and the tightness in Dan\u2019s chest starts to fade.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDid you get a chance to meet your tutor?\u201d asks Nathan after the next tutorial.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s hand is hovering on the doorknob. Everyone else has already left, and part of him wonders why he didn\u2019t rush out of his seat to avoid this conversation. He turns around, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you for arranging it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course,\u201d says Nathan. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be able to help you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His smile grows a little more genuine, then. He tries not to think of Phil telling him about the time he forgot to study for his first exam because he was too busy binge-watching Buffy for the too-manieth time. Dan had told him, in turn, about the time he forgot to study for A-levels because of Mortal Kombat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Nathan just nods, and doesn\u2019t say another word as Dan slips out the door.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSo I looked at your essay,\u201d says Phil as he sits down at their next meeting.\n</p><p>\n  He booked a room in the English department this time, one with big windows open into the hallway that make Dan want to squirm in his seat every time someone walks by. Not that it matters what the English profs think of him. He\u2019s probably never going to come back after he\u2019s done this course.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAnd?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. He drops Dan\u2019s essay, annotated in red ink, onto the table between them and his backpack onto the floor. There\u2019s a little Yoshi plushie hanging off the handle.\n</p><p>\n  Seeing it eases just a bit of Dan\u2019s anxiety.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think you overanalyze.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat\u2019s what Nathan said, too,\u201d says Dan. \u201cI, uh, don\u2019t really know what it means.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles, but it doesn\u2019t seem mocking. \u201cIt is kinda vague, huh?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods. He reaches forward, grabbing the essay to read some of the notes Phil made, written in messier handwriting around Nathan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re a philosophy major, right?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He hums. \u201cYup.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat could explain it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOy!\u201d Dan looks up. Phil\u2019s leaning forward in his seat, grinning. \u201cIs that a jab at my major?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil lifts his hands, hitting himself in the forehead as he does, swiping his fringe away from his eyes. He laughs, and his tongue pokes out between his teeth, and something goes tight in Dan\u2019s chest.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think about it too much.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Phil. \u201cOr maybe a little. I don\u2019t know. You just seem like someone prone to overthinking things. But that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He seems sincere. Dan can\u2019t bring himself to be upset about it.\n</p><p>\n  His finger drifts along the edge of his essay as he looks back down.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFine, then tell me about this overanalyzing thing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  By their fifth session, Dan knows more about Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He knows about his schedule, which leaves his Tuesday afternoons free at the same time as Dan\u2019s are and usually has them booking their meetings then. He knows he plays Mario games, like Dan does, and grew up playing something called Bubble Bobble that had Dan teasing him about being old.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s favourite type of book is horror, Dan had learned last week, after wondering if it was the type of story they were analyzing that made the class so hard.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done lit,\u201d Phil had said. \u201cAll the character-driven plots would have driven me insane.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan had bit at his lip, offered a grin. \u201cI like them,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cEven if I over-analyze them.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil had nudged their feet together under the table, back at the library that time. \u201cThat\u2019s why philosophy\u2019s perfect for you,\u201d he\u2019d said, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s smiling again today, over the edge of his syntax textbook, as Dan highlights passages in a short story called \n  <i>\n    The Yellow Wallpaper \n  </i>\n  they were asked to read. Dan has to force himself to stare at the text instead of the way Phil\u2019s eyes seem to shine in the too-bright light of the English Department.\n</p><p>\n  Dan drops the highlighter when he\u2019s finished reading. Phil\u2019s textbook is already closed and resting on his lap when he looks up.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou did well,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou haven\u2019t even looked over my work,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI saw what you were doing.\u201d There\u2019s a hint of laughter in Phil\u2019s eyes as he says it. He leans over the table, closer to Dan, and tugs the text towards him. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think of the ending?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan groans, letting his body collapse onto the table. \u201cNow you\u2019re just \n  <i>\n    asking \n  </i>\n  me to overanalyze.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, warm and happy, and knocks their knees together under the table. They\u2019re sitting closer today.\n</p><p>\n  That\u2019s another thing that\u2019s changed over the past few weeks.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUnless you come up with a true conspiracy theory,\u201d he says, \u201cI really don\u2019t think you can overanalyze this ending. It\u2019s pretty abstract.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cPretty? It doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He glares at the story, groans, and presses his head into his elbow to ignore it, just for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  Then Phil\u2019s hand is settling on his shoulder, squeezing gently.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to write an essay on this one, remember?\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to understand it enough for a quiz.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles even though Phil can\u2019t see it.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s hand stays on his shoulder until Dan lifts his head and gets back to work.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Their sixth meeting is back in the library.\n</p><p>\n  Phil shows up with his backpack on his shoulders and two cups of coffee in his hands. He sets one, the one with Dan\u2019s name scribbled across the side, in front of Dan, grinning. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you like caramel macchiatos?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan reaches for it. The cup is warm against his palm, the drink too hot when he takes a sip, but Dan smiles at the sweetness anyway. Of his drink, and, he realizes a moment after the feeling settles in his chest, of Phil, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI like them.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile only widens.\n</p><p>\n  He takes the seat next to Dan, humming around a sip of his own drink as their knees brush together under the table.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly outside, you have to take care of yourself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, presses his leg back against Phil\u2019s. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI wanted to,\u201d says Phil. \u201cBesides, I have, uh, YouTube money to spend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His cheeks go a little pink, and Dan knows he should be taking out his essay outline to have Phil help him look it over, but he doesn\u2019t want to. Not when Phil\u2019s scratching at the black ink scribbled on the side of his cup with the tip of his fingernail, staring at the tabletop. Not when his leg is still pressed against Dan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou do YouTube?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s chuckle is quiet, almost embarrassed. \u201cJust a bit. It doesn\u2019t actually make me enough money for Starbucks, but it\u2019s fun,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI do too,\u201d says Dan, and Phil looks up, eyes wide. \u201cNot enough to make any money, but it\u2019s, uh fun. Yeah.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d Phil\u2019s smile has spread across his whole face again. \u201cWhat kind of videos do you make? Would I like them?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUm, how do you feel about self deprecating humour and attempts at self-analysis?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His gaze flits over Dan\u2019s fringe, over his hoodie. \u201cLet me guess, you went through an emo phase, too?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I resent or appreciate your use of the past tense,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs so much his tongue sticks out between his teeth and his shoulder presses against Dan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has to try very hard not to let warmth bubble up in his chest again, without coffee to blame this time.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They meet up at Starbucks the eighth time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has another caramel macchiato in his hands, his final essay laid out across the table between them. Phil has a croissant that has his fingers a little buttery, so he smudges oil on the paper whenever he points out an error. He picks it apart and pops bites into his mouth, grinning around them as Dan marks the recommendations in red pen.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThere\u2019s not much to correct this time,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He still has a little bit of food in his mouth. Dan thinks he should probably be more disgusted than he is.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI already corrected most of it,\u201d he says, smiling to hide the warmth he feels in his cheeks. \n</p><p>\n  Phil shrugs. \u201cStill, you\u2019re learning how to write for English instead of Philosophy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting easier, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The corner of his mouth is quirked up, his smile crooked. Dan doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s drawn a slash of red ink across the page until Phil\u2019s eyes crinkle with a quiet giggle.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cEnd of the semester getting to you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His foot nudges Dan\u2019s. He blames how small the two-person Starbucks tables are, wedged into a corner like this with their long legs. It doesn\u2019t keep his chest from going warm, though. He\u2019s grown used to that, when Phil says something nice and he feels his whole body react to it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cA bit,\u201d says Dan. \u201cIt\u2019s not even done yet. We\u2019re just getting a break then it continues.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWith exams,\u201d says Phil. His nose crinkles, and Dan\u2019s stomach goes tight. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a study break.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m just gonna procrastinate studying until the last day, I already know it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile softens then. He takes another bite of his croissant, swallowing it with a sip of coffee, letting the silence linger. Dan takes a sip of his drink to fill it, to ignore the way his heart is suddenly pounding for no reason whatsoever.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMaybe I could remind you to study?\u201d says Phil. His cheeks have gone pink. He\u2019s fidgeting over the table so much Dan\u2019s fairly certain he\u2019s going to tear his bread to shreds. \u201cYou know, if you give me your number.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to quip that they\u2019d probably get too distracted talking to actually study, but his throat goes tight before he can. He hands over his phone, and tries not to let Phil see his smile. \n</p><p>\n  Tries not to admit he\u2019ll miss this, once his English class is over.\n</p><p>\n  Phil texts him, and grins when Dan\u2019s phone vibrates on the tabletop. He doesn\u2019t go to grab it at first, but Phil keeps staring at him, all wide eyes and expectation.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can\u2019t help but smile when he reads the messages.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hi it\u2019s Phil ^.^ I was thinking we should meet up after your exam\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    if you want I mean\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    no pressure\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  He grins as he types back: \n  <i>\n    ill text u when i get out\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Phil clicks his tongue. \u201cGrammar, Dan. You\u2019ll never get your grade up like this.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s laugh rumbles as they both set their phones down to finish their drinks, to look over the rest of Dan\u2019s paper. \n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still brushing under the table.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They text over winter break.\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s a conversation on the train about whether all the snow is melting as he gets further south. And another where Phil asks about his childhood bedroom, for whatever reason. Dan sends him a picture of Bangy just so he can sit down on the sofa and imagine the way Phil\u2019s eyes gleam when he\u2019s happy.\n</p><p>\n  He gets a message on Christmas morning that comes with a picture of Phil in his pyjamas, hugging a gift box to his chest. \n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles so wide his mum asks who he\u2019s texting in the lilted voice that makes his cheeks burn red. He hopes Phil can\u2019t tell in the photo he sends back.\n</p><p>\n  They do talk about schoolwork, sometimes, in timed study sessions. Dan\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s too distracted to remember anything about Parfit or Kant or Plato, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. Not when he needs to catch up on studying, alone late at night, and not when Phil admits studying together is a little distracting, too.\n</p><p>\n  One time, Phil makes a comment about how they\u2019ll need to play their new games together sometime.\n</p><p>\n  Another, Dan insinuates that Phil will see his room back at uni, and Phil doesn\u2019t protest. \n</p><p>\n  And there\u2019s a text on New Years, at midnight, that makes Dan\u2019s whole body go warm and giddy, just a little bit of alcohol in his stomach and a lot of thoughts he probably shouldn\u2019t have in his head.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s dreading finals when break ends, but he smiles the whole train ride home.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They meet up outside Starbucks after the final.\n</p><p>\n  Or, well, between Starbucks and the lecture hall when Dan wrote the test, because Phil\u2019s walking towards him, bag slung over one shoulders, bobble hat on his head. \n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s steps are bouncy. His shoulders feel light, his bag filled with only his wallet and pencil case, a whole semester of work falling away. He doesn\u2019t mean to when he reaches out, wraps an arm around Phil\u2019s shoulders, but Phil\u2019s arm curls at his waist and he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s okay.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s grinning. His cheeks are rosy, the tip of his nose red with winter cold. Dan smoothes a bare hand across his cheek. His heart is racing with the knowledge that he can, that Phil isn\u2019t flinching away.\n</p><p>\n  And he kisses him, soft and warm and grateful. \n</p><p>\n  Phil kisses back.\n</p><p>\n  His whole body feels warm when he pulls away, even as the wind sweeps under his jacket. His cheeks, he knows, are bright red. So are Phil\u2019s, though.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cShit,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to do that.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth quirks, eyes falling to the ground between them. His blush blooms up his cheeks, pinkening the tips of his ears more than the cold already had. Dan\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s intentional or caused by nerves when Phil squeezes his hip.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d says Phil. His voice is shaky. He draws away slowly, tucking his hands into his pockets and tilting his head so the bobble on his hat flops to the side. \u201cStill want coffee?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not going to tutor me again.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs and leads the way to Starbucks. \n</p>",

The only good part about English class so far is that he doesn\u2019t have a textbook to carry around with him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His tutor smiles, kind. \n</p><p>\n  All the staff here seem too kind. Dan kind of wishes they were scary. That would make it easier to hate them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you have a class now?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan we talk for a moment, then?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his hands from his bag. Walking into his tutorial today had already been dreadful. The heavy feeling he\u2019d been carrying in his chest since a few days ago comes back. He settles back into his seat, listening to every other student leave the room with rustling papers and loud footsteps. \n</p><p>\n  The doors at the uni are too heavy. They always fall closed with a loud thud.\n</p><p>\n  His tutor comes towards him only after the last student\u2019s left. Nathan, he told them to call him during the first tutorial. Calling people with actual PhDs by their first name still feels foreign on Dan\u2019s tongue, though. \n</p><p>\n  He sits down across from Dan, still smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m sure you saw your grade on the first essay,\u201d he says. \n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. The pressure in his chest is worse. \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Nathan nods. \u201cAs you know, a 36% is a failing grade.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI know,\u201d says Dan. \u201cAm I\u2013\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He cuts himself off. Asking if he\u2019s in trouble sounds stupid. He\u2019s supposed to be an adult now.\n</p><p>\n  Supposedly.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan shakes his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re okay. There\u2019ll be opportunities to bring your grade up,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, the professor is working with the university to help students who are struggling. We\u2019re trying to match students up with student tutors. Are you interested?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He isn\u2019t, not really. But Dan nods anyway.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan smiles, again. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll email you once I know the details, okay?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan just nods dumbly, slumped back in his seat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re free to go,\u201d says Nathan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. He stumbles to his feet, slings his backpack over his shoulder, and rushes out the door. \n</p><p>\n  He has almost an hour left before his metaphysics lecture.\n</p><p>\n  And he really needs coffee.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  He gets the email with the details on a Tuesday.\n</p><p>\n  A few hours later, he gets another email from a guy called Phil that\u2019s a little less formal, a little more nerdy. It\u2019s almost enough to put Dan at ease.\n</p><p>\n  He reads it sitting in his ethics tutorial, waiting for the class to start.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hello,\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    My name\u2019s Phil and I\u2019m going to be your tutor for ENGL10021. I\u2019m a third year student doing English Language and Linguistics, by the way. I\u2019ll be on campus tonight if you want to meet up. Let me know!\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Phil ^.^\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  His brain feels numb when he leaves the tutorial. \n</p><p>\n  Ethics is confusing. His brain is all muddled. There\u2019s an essay coming up and the thought of it has his breaths coming quicker, tighter, a little too desperate. Dan clutches the straps of his bag and rushes down the stairs, almost stumbling over his own feet.\n</p><p>\n  He needs more coffee.\n</p><p>\n  Not that it fixes anything.\n</p><p>\n  Dan ends up at Starbucks, one near campus that\u2019s always too full. Someone pulls the door open. Dan rushes in before it falls closed. He feels jittery. His heart\u2019s beating too fast.\n</p><p>\n  He takes two steps into the store before realizing he\u2019s not paying attention. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cFucking \n  <i>\n    shit.\n  </i>\n  \u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan blinks. He\u2019s standing still, suddenly, and there\u2019s a boy standing in front of him, staring with wide eyes. His shirt is stained, wet and sticking to his skin.\n</p><p>\n  It takes Dan a moment to realize he\u2019s drenched in the shit, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re fucking going, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2013\u201d says the boy. He looks almost defensive, but it fades into something softer. \u201cSorry, I will. You should, too, though.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Bitterness flares, angry, in Dan\u2019s chest, but he doesn\u2019t argue. The boy lingers there for a moment. He has black hair, cutting across his forehead in a fringe that mirrors Dan\u2019s, and his eyes are still just a little too wide.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI, uh, have a lecture,\u201d the boy blurts. His coffee \u2014 iced, thankfully \u2014 is half empty, the plastic lid hanging off the straw, but he doesn\u2019t bother to fix it before leaving.\n</p><p>\n  Dan leaves without getting coffee.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  His leg is bouncing when he sits down at the library.\n</p><p>\n  The floor, Green 2 because it\u2019s the only social one in the main library, is full of people chatting with their friends and Dan feels stupid, sitting at a table by himself. He didn\u2019t even have time to go back to his room to pick up his English books. \n</p><p>\n  He should have gotten coffee before coming, he thinks. It\u2019s the only thing keeping him going by this point.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDan?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He jumps, swivels in his chair and\u2013\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck, please don\u2019t say you\u2019re Phil.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The boy standing there offers half a smile. \u201cSorry to disappoint?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s leg starts bouncing again. His chest feels too tight. He tries to remember the topics for his ethics essay to distract himself, but all that does is make his breaths come faster, his mind go a little more hazy around the edges. He doesn\u2019t want to think about philosophy.\n</p><p>\n  Uni\u2019s making him not want to think about anything.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He forces his eyes open. Phil\u2019s sitting across from him now, his bag on the table. There\u2019s a coffee-coloured stain on his shirt.\n</p><p>\n  Dan helped put it there.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI can\u2019t fail this fucking class,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t let me fail.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil frowns. \u201cWhy would I let you fail?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs, motioning vaguely towards Phil\u2019s chest. He\u2019s still not breathing properly.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh, this?\u201d Phil\u2019s smile quirks wider, happier, a little more crooked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll get my mum to wash it tonight and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He sounds so genuine that Dan manages to stop jittering for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNow, tell me about yourself?\u201d says Phil. \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan manages half a smile back. \u201cPhilosophy,\u201d he says. \u201cSince English clearly isn\u2019t my strong suit.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, and the tightness in Dan\u2019s chest starts to fade.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDid you get a chance to meet your tutor?\u201d asks Nathan after the next tutorial.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s hand is hovering on the doorknob. Everyone else has already left, and part of him wonders why he didn\u2019t rush out of his seat to avoid this conversation. He turns around, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you for arranging it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course,\u201d says Nathan. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be able to help you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His smile grows a little more genuine, then. He tries not to think of Phil telling him about the time he forgot to study for his first exam because he was too busy binge-watching Buffy for the too-manieth time. Dan had told him, in turn, about the time he forgot to study for A-levels because of Mortal Kombat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Nathan just nods, and doesn\u2019t say another word as Dan slips out the door.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSo I looked at your essay,\u201d says Phil as he sits down at their next meeting.\n</p><p>\n  He booked a room in the English department this time, one with big windows open into the hallway that make Dan want to squirm in his seat every time someone walks by. Not that it matters what the English profs think of him. He\u2019s probably never going to come back after he\u2019s done this course.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAnd?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. He drops Dan\u2019s essay, annotated in red ink, onto the table between them and his backpack onto the floor. There\u2019s a little Yoshi plushie hanging off the handle.\n</p><p>\n  Seeing it eases just a bit of Dan\u2019s anxiety.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think you overanalyze.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat\u2019s what Nathan said, too,\u201d says Dan. \u201cI, uh, don\u2019t really know what it means.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles, but it doesn\u2019t seem mocking. \u201cIt is kinda vague, huh?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods. He reaches forward, grabbing the essay to read some of the notes Phil made, written in messier handwriting around Nathan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re a philosophy major, right?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He hums. \u201cYup.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat could explain it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOy!\u201d Dan looks up. Phil\u2019s leaning forward in his seat, grinning. \u201cIs that a jab at my major?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil lifts his hands, hitting himself in the forehead as he does, swiping his fringe away from his eyes. He laughs, and his tongue pokes out between his teeth, and something goes tight in Dan\u2019s chest.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think about it too much.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Phil. \u201cOr maybe a little. I don\u2019t know. You just seem like someone prone to overthinking things. But that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He seems sincere. Dan can\u2019t bring himself to be upset about it.\n</p><p>\n  His finger drifts along the edge of his essay as he looks back down.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFine, then tell me about this overanalyzing thing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  By their fifth session, Dan knows more about Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He knows about his schedule, which leaves his Tuesday afternoons free at the same time as Dan\u2019s are and usually has them booking their meetings then. He knows he plays Mario games, like Dan does, and grew up playing something called Bubble Bobble that had Dan teasing him about being old.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s favourite type of book is horror, Dan had learned last week, after wondering if it was the type of story they were analyzing that made the class so hard.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done lit,\u201d Phil had said. \u201cAll the character-driven plots would have driven me insane.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan had bit at his lip, offered a grin. \u201cI like them,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cEven if I over-analyze them.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil had nudged their feet together under the table, back at the library that time. \u201cThat\u2019s why philosophy\u2019s perfect for you,\u201d he\u2019d said, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s smiling again today, over the edge of his syntax textbook, as Dan highlights passages in a short story called \n  <i>\n    The Yellow Wallpaper \n  </i>\n  they were asked to read. Dan has to force himself to stare at the text instead of the way Phil\u2019s eyes seem to shine in the too-bright light of the English Department.\n</p><p>\n  Dan drops the highlighter when he\u2019s finished reading. Phil\u2019s textbook is already closed and resting on his lap when he looks up.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou did well,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou haven\u2019t even looked over my work,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI saw what you were doing.\u201d There\u2019s a hint of laughter in Phil\u2019s eyes as he says it. He leans over the table, closer to Dan, and tugs the text towards him. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think of the ending?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan groans, letting his body collapse onto the table. \u201cNow you\u2019re just \n  <i>\n    asking \n  </i>\n  me to overanalyze.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, warm and happy, and knocks their knees together under the table. They\u2019re sitting closer today.\n</p><p>\n  That\u2019s another thing that\u2019s changed over the past few weeks.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUnless you come up with a true conspiracy theory,\u201d he says, \u201cI really don\u2019t think you can overanalyze this ending. It\u2019s pretty abstract.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cPretty? It doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He glares at the story, groans, and presses his head into his elbow to ignore it, just for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  Then Phil\u2019s hand is settling on his shoulder, squeezing gently.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to write an essay on this one, remember?\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to understand it enough for a quiz.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles even though Phil can\u2019t see it.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s hand stays on his shoulder until Dan lifts his head and gets back to work.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Their sixth meeting is back in the library.\n</p><p>\n  Phil shows up with his backpack on his shoulders and two cups of coffee in his hands. He sets one, the one with Dan\u2019s name scribbled across the side, in front of Dan, grinning. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you like caramel macchiatos?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan reaches for it. The cup is warm against his palm, the drink too hot when he takes a sip, but Dan smiles at the sweetness anyway. Of his drink, and, he realizes a moment after the feeling settles in his chest, of Phil, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI like them.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile only widens.\n</p><p>\n  He takes the seat next to Dan, humming around a sip of his own drink as their knees brush together under the table.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly outside, you have to take care of yourself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, presses his leg back against Phil\u2019s. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI wanted to,\u201d says Phil. \u201cBesides, I have, uh, YouTube money to spend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His cheeks go a little pink, and Dan knows he should be taking out his essay outline to have Phil help him look it over, but he doesn\u2019t want to. Not when Phil\u2019s scratching at the black ink scribbled on the side of his cup with the tip of his fingernail, staring at the tabletop. Not when his leg is still pressed against Dan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou do YouTube?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s chuckle is quiet, almost embarrassed. \u201cJust a bit. It doesn\u2019t actually make me enough money for Starbucks, but it\u2019s fun,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI do too,\u201d says Dan, and Phil looks up, eyes wide. \u201cNot enough to make any money, but it\u2019s, uh fun. Yeah.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d Phil\u2019s smile has spread across his whole face again. \u201cWhat kind of videos do you make? Would I like them?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUm, how do you feel about self deprecating humour and attempts at self-analysis?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His gaze flits over Dan\u2019s fringe, over his hoodie. \u201cLet me guess, you went through an emo phase, too?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I resent or appreciate your use of the past tense,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs so much his tongue sticks out between his teeth and his shoulder presses against Dan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has to try very hard not to let warmth bubble up in his chest again, without coffee to blame this time.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They meet up at Starbucks the eighth time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has another caramel macchiato in his hands, his final essay laid out across the table between them. Phil has a croissant that has his fingers a little buttery, so he smudges oil on the paper whenever he points out an error. He picks it apart and pops bites into his mouth, grinning around them as Dan marks the recommendations in red pen.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThere\u2019s not much to correct this time,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He still has a little bit of food in his mouth. Dan thinks he should probably be more disgusted than he is.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI already corrected most of it,\u201d he says, smiling to hide the warmth he feels in his cheeks. \n</p><p>\n  Phil shrugs. \u201cStill, you\u2019re learning how to write for English instead of Philosophy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting easier, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The corner of his mouth is quirked up, his smile crooked. Dan doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s drawn a slash of red ink across the page until Phil\u2019s eyes crinkle with a quiet giggle.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cEnd of the semester getting to you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His foot nudges Dan\u2019s. He blames how small the two-person Starbucks tables are, wedged into a corner like this with their long legs. It doesn\u2019t keep his chest from going warm, though. He\u2019s grown used to that, when Phil says something nice and he feels his whole body react to it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cA bit,\u201d says Dan. \u201cIt\u2019s not even done yet. We\u2019re just getting a break then it continues.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWith exams,\u201d says Phil. His nose crinkles, and Dan\u2019s stomach goes tight. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a study break.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m just gonna procrastinate studying until the last day, I already know it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile softens then. He takes another bite of his croissant, swallowing it with a sip of coffee, letting the silence linger. Dan takes a sip of his drink to fill it, to ignore the way his heart is suddenly pounding for no reason whatsoever.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMaybe I could remind you to study?\u201d says Phil. His cheeks have gone pink. He\u2019s fidgeting over the table so much Dan\u2019s fairly certain he\u2019s going to tear his bread to shreds. \u201cYou know, if you give me your number.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to quip that they\u2019d probably get too distracted talking to actually study, but his throat goes tight before he can. He hands over his phone, and tries not to let Phil see his smile. \n</p><p>\n  Tries not to admit he\u2019ll miss this, once his English class is over.\n</p><p>\n  Phil texts him, and grins when Dan\u2019s phone vibrates on the tabletop. He doesn\u2019t go to grab it at first, but Phil keeps staring at him, all wide eyes and expectation.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can\u2019t help but smile when he reads the messages.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hi it\u2019s Phil ^.^ I was thinking we should meet up after your exam\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    if you want I mean\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    no pressure\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  He grins as he types back: \n  <i>\n    ill text u when i get out\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Phil clicks his tongue. \u201cGrammar, Dan. You\u2019ll never get your grade up like this.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s laugh rumbles as they both set their phones down to finish their drinks, to look over the rest of Dan\u2019s paper. \n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still brushing under the table.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They text over winter break.\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s a conversation on the train about whether all the snow is melting as he gets further south. And another where Phil asks about his childhood bedroom, for whatever reason. Dan sends him a picture of Bangy just so he can sit down on the sofa and imagine the way Phil\u2019s eyes gleam when he\u2019s happy.\n</p><p>\n  He gets a message on Christmas morning that comes with a picture of Phil in his pyjamas, hugging a gift box to his chest. \n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles so wide his mum asks who he\u2019s texting in the lilted voice that makes his cheeks burn red. He hopes Phil can\u2019t tell in the photo he sends back.\n</p><p>\n  They do talk about schoolwork, sometimes, in timed study sessions. Dan\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s too distracted to remember anything about Parfit or Kant or Plato, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. Not when he needs to catch up on studying, alone late at night, and not when Phil admits studying together is a little distracting, too.\n</p><p>\n  One time, Phil makes a comment about how they\u2019ll need to play their new games together sometime.\n</p><p>\n  Another, Dan insinuates that Phil will see his room back at uni, and Phil doesn\u2019t protest. \n</p><p>\n  And there\u2019s a text on New Years, at midnight, that makes Dan\u2019s whole body go warm and giddy, just a little bit of alcohol in his stomach and a lot of thoughts he probably shouldn\u2019t have in his head.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s dreading finals when break ends, but he smiles the whole train ride home.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They meet up outside Starbucks after the final.\n</p><p>\n  Or, well, between Starbucks and the lecture hall when Dan wrote the test, because Phil\u2019s walking towards him, bag slung over one shoulders, bobble hat on his head. \n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s steps are bouncy. His shoulders feel light, his bag filled with only his wallet and pencil case, a whole semester of work falling away. He doesn\u2019t mean to when he reaches out, wraps an arm around Phil\u2019s shoulders, but Phil\u2019s arm curls at his waist and he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s okay.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s grinning. His cheeks are rosy, the tip of his nose red with winter cold. Dan smoothes a bare hand across his cheek. His heart is racing with the knowledge that he can, that Phil isn\u2019t flinching away.\n</p><p>\n  And he kisses him, soft and warm and grateful. \n</p><p>\n  Phil kisses back.\n</p><p>\n  His whole body feels warm when he pulls away, even as the wind sweeps under his jacket. His cheeks, he knows, are bright red. So are Phil\u2019s, though.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cShit,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to do that.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth quirks, eyes falling to the ground between them. His blush blooms up his cheeks, pinkening the tips of his ears more than the cold already had. Dan\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s intentional or caused by nerves when Phil squeezes his hip.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d says Phil. His voice is shaky. He draws away slowly, tucking his hands into his pockets and tilting his head so the bobble on his hat flops to the side. \u201cStill want coffee?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not going to tutor me again.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs and leads the way to Starbucks. \n</p>",

The only good part about English class so far is that he doesn\u2019t have a textbook to carry around with him.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYes, sir?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His tutor smiles, kind. \n</p><p>\n  All the staff here seem too kind. Dan kind of wishes they were scary. That would make it easier to hate them.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you have a class now?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cCan we talk for a moment, then?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his hands from his bag. Walking into his tutorial today had already been dreadful. The heavy feeling he\u2019d been carrying in his chest since a few days ago comes back. He settles back into his seat, listening to every other student leave the room with rustling papers and loud footsteps. \n</p><p>\n  The doors at the uni are too heavy. They always fall closed with a loud thud.\n</p><p>\n  His tutor comes towards him only after the last student\u2019s left. Nathan, he told them to call him during the first tutorial. Calling people with actual PhDs by their first name still feels foreign on Dan\u2019s tongue, though. \n</p><p>\n  He sits down across from Dan, still smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m sure you saw your grade on the first essay,\u201d he says. \n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. The pressure in his chest is worse. \u201cUh, yeah.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Nathan nods. \u201cAs you know, a 36% is a failing grade.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI know,\u201d says Dan. \u201cAm I\u2013\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He cuts himself off. Asking if he\u2019s in trouble sounds stupid. He\u2019s supposed to be an adult now.\n</p><p>\n  Supposedly.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan shakes his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re okay. There\u2019ll be opportunities to bring your grade up,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, the professor is working with the university to help students who are struggling. We\u2019re trying to match students up with student tutors. Are you interested?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He isn\u2019t, not really. But Dan nods anyway.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan smiles, again. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll email you once I know the details, okay?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan just nods dumbly, slumped back in his seat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re free to go,\u201d says Nathan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh,\u201d says Dan. He stumbles to his feet, slings his backpack over his shoulder, and rushes out the door. \n</p><p>\n  He has almost an hour left before his metaphysics lecture.\n</p><p>\n  And he really needs coffee.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  He gets the email with the details on a Tuesday.\n</p><p>\n  A few hours later, he gets another email from a guy called Phil that\u2019s a little less formal, a little more nerdy. It\u2019s almost enough to put Dan at ease.\n</p><p>\n  He reads it sitting in his ethics tutorial, waiting for the class to start.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hello,\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    My name\u2019s Phil and I\u2019m going to be your tutor for ENGL10021. I\u2019m a third year student doing English Language and Linguistics, by the way. I\u2019ll be on campus tonight if you want to meet up. Let me know!\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Phil ^.^\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  His brain feels numb when he leaves the tutorial. \n</p><p>\n  Ethics is confusing. His brain is all muddled. There\u2019s an essay coming up and the thought of it has his breaths coming quicker, tighter, a little too desperate. Dan clutches the straps of his bag and rushes down the stairs, almost stumbling over his own feet.\n</p><p>\n  He needs more coffee.\n</p><p>\n  Not that it fixes anything.\n</p><p>\n  Dan ends up at Starbucks, one near campus that\u2019s always too full. Someone pulls the door open. Dan rushes in before it falls closed. He feels jittery. His heart\u2019s beating too fast.\n</p><p>\n  He takes two steps into the store before realizing he\u2019s not paying attention. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cFucking \n  <i>\n    shit.\n  </i>\n  \u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan blinks. He\u2019s standing still, suddenly, and there\u2019s a boy standing in front of him, staring with wide eyes. His shirt is stained, wet and sticking to his skin.\n</p><p>\n  It takes Dan a moment to realize he\u2019s drenched in the shit, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re fucking going, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2013\u201d says the boy. He looks almost defensive, but it fades into something softer. \u201cSorry, I will. You should, too, though.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Bitterness flares, angry, in Dan\u2019s chest, but he doesn\u2019t argue. The boy lingers there for a moment. He has black hair, cutting across his forehead in a fringe that mirrors Dan\u2019s, and his eyes are still just a little too wide.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI, uh, have a lecture,\u201d the boy blurts. His coffee \u2014 iced, thankfully \u2014 is half empty, the plastic lid hanging off the straw, but he doesn\u2019t bother to fix it before leaving.\n</p><p>\n  Dan leaves without getting coffee.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  His leg is bouncing when he sits down at the library.\n</p><p>\n  The floor, Green 2 because it\u2019s the only social one in the main library, is full of people chatting with their friends and Dan feels stupid, sitting at a table by himself. He didn\u2019t even have time to go back to his room to pick up his English books. \n</p><p>\n  He should have gotten coffee before coming, he thinks. It\u2019s the only thing keeping him going by this point.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDan?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He jumps, swivels in his chair and\u2013\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFuck, please don\u2019t say you\u2019re Phil.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The boy standing there offers half a smile. \u201cSorry to disappoint?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s leg starts bouncing again. His chest feels too tight. He tries to remember the topics for his ethics essay to distract himself, but all that does is make his breaths come faster, his mind go a little more hazy around the edges. He doesn\u2019t want to think about philosophy.\n</p><p>\n  Uni\u2019s making him not want to think about anything.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He forces his eyes open. Phil\u2019s sitting across from him now, his bag on the table. There\u2019s a coffee-coloured stain on his shirt.\n</p><p>\n  Dan helped put it there.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI can\u2019t fail this fucking class,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t let me fail.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil frowns. \u201cWhy would I let you fail?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs, motioning vaguely towards Phil\u2019s chest. He\u2019s still not breathing properly.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOh, this?\u201d Phil\u2019s smile quirks wider, happier, a little more crooked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll get my mum to wash it tonight and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He sounds so genuine that Dan manages to stop jittering for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNow, tell me about yourself?\u201d says Phil. \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan manages half a smile back. \u201cPhilosophy,\u201d he says. \u201cSince English clearly isn\u2019t my strong suit.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, and the tightness in Dan\u2019s chest starts to fade.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDid you get a chance to meet your tutor?\u201d asks Nathan after the next tutorial.\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s hand is hovering on the doorknob. Everyone else has already left, and part of him wonders why he didn\u2019t rush out of his seat to avoid this conversation. He turns around, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you for arranging it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOf course,\u201d says Nathan. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be able to help you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His smile grows a little more genuine, then. He tries not to think of Phil telling him about the time he forgot to study for his first exam because he was too busy binge-watching Buffy for the too-manieth time. Dan had told him, in turn, about the time he forgot to study for A-levels because of Mortal Kombat.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Nathan just nods, and doesn\u2019t say another word as Dan slips out the door.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  \u201cSo I looked at your essay,\u201d says Phil as he sits down at their next meeting.\n</p><p>\n  He booked a room in the English department this time, one with big windows open into the hallway that make Dan want to squirm in his seat every time someone walks by. Not that it matters what the English profs think of him. He\u2019s probably never going to come back after he\u2019s done this course.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAnd?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. He drops Dan\u2019s essay, annotated in red ink, onto the table between them and his backpack onto the floor. There\u2019s a little Yoshi plushie hanging off the handle.\n</p><p>\n  Seeing it eases just a bit of Dan\u2019s anxiety.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI think you overanalyze.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat\u2019s what Nathan said, too,\u201d says Dan. \u201cI, uh, don\u2019t really know what it means.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles, but it doesn\u2019t seem mocking. \u201cIt is kinda vague, huh?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods. He reaches forward, grabbing the essay to read some of the notes Phil made, written in messier handwriting around Nathan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou\u2019re a philosophy major, right?\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He hums. \u201cYup.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat could explain it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cOy!\u201d Dan looks up. Phil\u2019s leaning forward in his seat, grinning. \u201cIs that a jab at my major?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil lifts his hands, hitting himself in the forehead as he does, swiping his fringe away from his eyes. He laughs, and his tongue pokes out between his teeth, and something goes tight in Dan\u2019s chest.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think about it too much.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Phil. \u201cOr maybe a little. I don\u2019t know. You just seem like someone prone to overthinking things. But that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He seems sincere. Dan can\u2019t bring himself to be upset about it.\n</p><p>\n  His finger drifts along the edge of his essay as he looks back down.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cFine, then tell me about this overanalyzing thing.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  By their fifth session, Dan knows more about Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He knows about his schedule, which leaves his Tuesday afternoons free at the same time as Dan\u2019s are and usually has them booking their meetings then. He knows he plays Mario games, like Dan does, and grew up playing something called Bubble Bobble that had Dan teasing him about being old.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s favourite type of book is horror, Dan had learned last week, after wondering if it was the type of story they were analyzing that made the class so hard.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done lit,\u201d Phil had said. \u201cAll the character-driven plots would have driven me insane.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan had bit at his lip, offered a grin. \u201cI like them,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cEven if I over-analyze them.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil had nudged their feet together under the table, back at the library that time. \u201cThat\u2019s why philosophy\u2019s perfect for you,\u201d he\u2019d said, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s smiling again today, over the edge of his syntax textbook, as Dan highlights passages in a short story called \n  <i>\n    The Yellow Wallpaper \n  </i>\n  they were asked to read. Dan has to force himself to stare at the text instead of the way Phil\u2019s eyes seem to shine in the too-bright light of the English Department.\n</p><p>\n  Dan drops the highlighter when he\u2019s finished reading. Phil\u2019s textbook is already closed and resting on his lap when he looks up.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou did well,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou haven\u2019t even looked over my work,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI saw what you were doing.\u201d There\u2019s a hint of laughter in Phil\u2019s eyes as he says it. He leans over the table, closer to Dan, and tugs the text towards him. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think of the ending?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan groans, letting his body collapse onto the table. \u201cNow you\u2019re just \n  <i>\n    asking \n  </i>\n  me to overanalyze.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, warm and happy, and knocks their knees together under the table. They\u2019re sitting closer today.\n</p><p>\n  That\u2019s another thing that\u2019s changed over the past few weeks.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUnless you come up with a true conspiracy theory,\u201d he says, \u201cI really don\u2019t think you can overanalyze this ending. It\u2019s pretty abstract.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cPretty? It doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  He glares at the story, groans, and presses his head into his elbow to ignore it, just for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  Then Phil\u2019s hand is settling on his shoulder, squeezing gently.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to write an essay on this one, remember?\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to understand it enough for a quiz.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles even though Phil can\u2019t see it.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s hand stays on his shoulder until Dan lifts his head and gets back to work.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  Their sixth meeting is back in the library.\n</p><p>\n  Phil shows up with his backpack on his shoulders and two cups of coffee in his hands. He sets one, the one with Dan\u2019s name scribbled across the side, in front of Dan, grinning. \n</p><p>\n  \u201cDo you like caramel macchiatos?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan reaches for it. The cup is warm against his palm, the drink too hot when he takes a sip, but Dan smiles at the sweetness anyway. Of his drink, and, he realizes a moment after the feeling settles in his chest, of Phil, too.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI like them.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile only widens.\n</p><p>\n  He takes the seat next to Dan, humming around a sip of his own drink as their knees brush together under the table.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly outside, you have to take care of yourself.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, presses his leg back against Phil\u2019s. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI wanted to,\u201d says Phil. \u201cBesides, I have, uh, YouTube money to spend.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His cheeks go a little pink, and Dan knows he should be taking out his essay outline to have Phil help him look it over, but he doesn\u2019t want to. Not when Phil\u2019s scratching at the black ink scribbled on the side of his cup with the tip of his fingernail, staring at the tabletop. Not when his leg is still pressed against Dan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cYou do YouTube?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s chuckle is quiet, almost embarrassed. \u201cJust a bit. It doesn\u2019t actually make me enough money for Starbucks, but it\u2019s fun,\u201d he says.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI do too,\u201d says Dan, and Phil looks up, eyes wide. \u201cNot enough to make any money, but it\u2019s, uh fun. Yeah.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d Phil\u2019s smile has spread across his whole face again. \u201cWhat kind of videos do you make? Would I like them?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cUm, how do you feel about self deprecating humour and attempts at self-analysis?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His gaze flits over Dan\u2019s fringe, over his hoodie. \u201cLet me guess, you went through an emo phase, too?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I resent or appreciate your use of the past tense,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs so much his tongue sticks out between his teeth and his shoulder presses against Dan\u2019s.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has to try very hard not to let warmth bubble up in his chest again, without coffee to blame this time.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They meet up at Starbucks the eighth time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has another caramel macchiato in his hands, his final essay laid out across the table between them. Phil has a croissant that has his fingers a little buttery, so he smudges oil on the paper whenever he points out an error. He picks it apart and pops bites into his mouth, grinning around them as Dan marks the recommendations in red pen.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cThere\u2019s not much to correct this time,\u201d says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He still has a little bit of food in his mouth. Dan thinks he should probably be more disgusted than he is.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI already corrected most of it,\u201d he says, smiling to hide the warmth he feels in his cheeks. \n</p><p>\n  Phil shrugs. \u201cStill, you\u2019re learning how to write for English instead of Philosophy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting easier, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The corner of his mouth is quirked up, his smile crooked. Dan doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s drawn a slash of red ink across the page until Phil\u2019s eyes crinkle with a quiet giggle.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cEnd of the semester getting to you?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  His foot nudges Dan\u2019s. He blames how small the two-person Starbucks tables are, wedged into a corner like this with their long legs. It doesn\u2019t keep his chest from going warm, though. He\u2019s grown used to that, when Phil says something nice and he feels his whole body react to it.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cA bit,\u201d says Dan. \u201cIt\u2019s not even done yet. We\u2019re just getting a break then it continues.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWith exams,\u201d says Phil. His nose crinkles, and Dan\u2019s stomach goes tight. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a study break.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m just gonna procrastinate studying until the last day, I already know it.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s smile softens then. He takes another bite of his croissant, swallowing it with a sip of coffee, letting the silence linger. Dan takes a sip of his drink to fill it, to ignore the way his heart is suddenly pounding for no reason whatsoever.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cMaybe I could remind you to study?\u201d says Phil. His cheeks have gone pink. He\u2019s fidgeting over the table so much Dan\u2019s fairly certain he\u2019s going to tear his bread to shreds. \u201cYou know, if you give me your number.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to quip that they\u2019d probably get too distracted talking to actually study, but his throat goes tight before he can. He hands over his phone, and tries not to let Phil see his smile. \n</p><p>\n  Tries not to admit he\u2019ll miss this, once his English class is over.\n</p><p>\n  Phil texts him, and grins when Dan\u2019s phone vibrates on the tabletop. He doesn\u2019t go to grab it at first, but Phil keeps staring at him, all wide eyes and expectation.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can\u2019t help but smile when he reads the messages.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hi it\u2019s Phil ^.^ I was thinking we should meet up after your exam\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    if you want I mean\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    no pressure\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  He grins as he types back: \n  <i>\n    ill text u when i get out\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Phil clicks his tongue. \u201cGrammar, Dan. You\u2019ll never get your grade up like this.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s laugh rumbles as they both set their phones down to finish their drinks, to look over the rest of Dan\u2019s paper. \n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still brushing under the table.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They text over winter break.\n</p><p>\n  There\u2019s a conversation on the train about whether all the snow is melting as he gets further south. And another where Phil asks about his childhood bedroom, for whatever reason. Dan sends him a picture of Bangy just so he can sit down on the sofa and imagine the way Phil\u2019s eyes gleam when he\u2019s happy.\n</p><p>\n  He gets a message on Christmas morning that comes with a picture of Phil in his pyjamas, hugging a gift box to his chest. \n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles so wide his mum asks who he\u2019s texting in the lilted voice that makes his cheeks burn red. He hopes Phil can\u2019t tell in the photo he sends back.\n</p><p>\n  They do talk about schoolwork, sometimes, in timed study sessions. Dan\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s too distracted to remember anything about Parfit or Kant or Plato, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. Not when he needs to catch up on studying, alone late at night, and not when Phil admits studying together is a little distracting, too.\n</p><p>\n  One time, Phil makes a comment about how they\u2019ll need to play their new games together sometime.\n</p><p>\n  Another, Dan insinuates that Phil will see his room back at uni, and Phil doesn\u2019t protest. \n</p><p>\n  And there\u2019s a text on New Years, at midnight, that makes Dan\u2019s whole body go warm and giddy, just a little bit of alcohol in his stomach and a lot of thoughts he probably shouldn\u2019t have in his head.\n</p><p>\n  He\u2019s dreading finals when break ends, but he smiles the whole train ride home.\n</p><p>\n  \u2014\n</p><p>\n  They meet up outside Starbucks after the final.\n</p><p>\n  Or, well, between Starbucks and the lecture hall when Dan wrote the test, because Phil\u2019s walking towards him, bag slung over one shoulders, bobble hat on his head. \n</p><p>\n  Dan\u2019s steps are bouncy. His shoulders feel light, his bag filled with only his wallet and pencil case, a whole semester of work falling away. He doesn\u2019t mean to when he reaches out, wraps an arm around Phil\u2019s shoulders, but Phil\u2019s arm curls at his waist and he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s okay.\n</p><p>\n  Phil\u2019s grinning. His cheeks are rosy, the tip of his nose red with winter cold. Dan smoothes a bare hand across his cheek. His heart is racing with the knowledge that he can, that Phil isn\u2019t flinching away.\n</p><p>\n  And he kisses him, soft and warm and grateful. \n</p><p>\n  Phil kisses back.\n</p><p>\n  His whole body feels warm when he pulls away, even as the wind sweeps under his jacket. His cheeks, he knows, are bright red. So are Phil\u2019s, though.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cShit,\u201d says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cWhat?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to do that.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth quirks, eyes falling to the ground between them. His blush blooms up his cheeks, pinkening the tips of his ears more than the cold already had. Dan\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s intentional or caused by nerves when Phil squeezes his hip.\n</p><p>\n  \u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d says Phil. His voice is shaky. He draws away slowly, tucking his hands into his pockets and tilting his head so the bobble on his hat flops to the side. \u201cStill want coffee?\u201d\n</p><p>\n  \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not going to tutor me again.\u201d\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs and leads the way to Starbucks. \n</p>",

The only good part about English class so far is that he doesn&rsquo;t have a textbook to carry around with him.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  His tutor smiles, kind. \n</p><p>\n  All the staff here seem too kind. Dan kind of wishes they were scary. That would make it easier to hate them.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Do you have a class now?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Can we talk for a moment, then?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He lifts his hands from his bag. Walking into his tutorial today had already been dreadful. The heavy feeling he&rsquo;d been carrying in his chest since a few days ago comes back. He settles back into his seat, listening to every other student leave the room with rustling papers and loud footsteps. \n</p><p>\n  The doors at the uni are too heavy. They always fall closed with a loud thud.\n</p><p>\n  His tutor comes towards him only after the last student&rsquo;s left. Nathan, he told them to call him during the first tutorial. Calling people with actual PhDs by their first name still feels foreign on Dan&rsquo;s tongue, though. \n</p><p>\n  He sits down across from Dan, still smiling.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you saw your grade on the first essay,&rdquo; he says. \n</p><p>\n  Dan swallows. The pressure in his chest is worse. &ldquo;Uh, yeah.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Nathan nods. &ldquo;As you know, a 36% is a failing grade.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; says Dan. &ldquo;Am I&ndash;&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He cuts himself off. Asking if he&rsquo;s in trouble sounds stupid. He&rsquo;s supposed to be an adult now.\n</p><p>\n  Supposedly.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan shakes his head. &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re okay. There&rsquo;ll be opportunities to bring your grade up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Actually, the professor is working with the university to help students who are struggling. We&rsquo;re trying to match students up with student tutors. Are you interested?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He isn&rsquo;t, not really. But Dan nods anyway.\n</p><p>\n  Nathan smiles, again. &ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll email you once I know the details, okay?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan just nods dumbly, slumped back in his seat.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re free to go,&rdquo; says Nathan.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says Dan. He stumbles to his feet, slings his backpack over his shoulder, and rushes out the door. \n</p><p>\n  He has almost an hour left before his metaphysics lecture.\n</p><p>\n  And he really needs coffee.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  He gets the email with the details on a Tuesday.\n</p><p>\n  A few hours later, he gets another email from a guy called Phil that&rsquo;s a little less formal, a little more nerdy. It&rsquo;s almost enough to put Dan at ease.\n</p><p>\n  He reads it sitting in his ethics tutorial, waiting for the class to start.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hello,\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    My name&rsquo;s Phil and I&rsquo;m going to be your tutor for ENGL10021. I&rsquo;m a third year student doing English Language and Linguistics, by the way. I&rsquo;ll be on campus tonight if you want to meet up. Let me know!\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Phil ^.^\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  His brain feels numb when he leaves the tutorial. \n</p><p>\n  Ethics is confusing. His brain is all muddled. There&rsquo;s an essay coming up and the thought of it has his breaths coming quicker, tighter, a little too desperate. Dan clutches the straps of his bag and rushes down the stairs, almost stumbling over his own feet.\n</p><p>\n  He needs more coffee.\n</p><p>\n  Not that it fixes anything.\n</p><p>\n  Dan ends up at Starbucks, one near campus that&rsquo;s always too full. Someone pulls the door open. Dan rushes in before it falls closed. He feels jittery. His heart&rsquo;s beating too fast.\n</p><p>\n  He takes two steps into the store before realizing he&rsquo;s not paying attention. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Fucking \n  <i>\n    shit.\n  </i>\n  &rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan blinks. He&rsquo;s standing still, suddenly, and there&rsquo;s a boy standing in front of him, staring with wide eyes. His shirt is stained, wet and sticking to his skin.\n</p><p>\n  It takes Dan a moment to realize he&rsquo;s drenched in the shit, too.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he repeats. &ldquo;Watch where you&rsquo;re fucking going, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&ndash;&rdquo; says the boy. He looks almost defensive, but it fades into something softer. &ldquo;Sorry, I will. You should, too, though.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Bitterness flares, angry, in Dan&rsquo;s chest, but he doesn&rsquo;t argue. The boy lingers there for a moment. He has black hair, cutting across his forehead in a fringe that mirrors Dan&rsquo;s, and his eyes are still just a little too wide.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I, uh, have a lecture,&rdquo; the boy blurts. His coffee &mdash; iced, thankfully &mdash; is half empty, the plastic lid hanging off the straw, but he doesn&rsquo;t bother to fix it before leaving.\n</p><p>\n  Dan leaves without getting coffee.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  His leg is bouncing when he sits down at the library.\n</p><p>\n  The floor, Green 2 because it&rsquo;s the only social one in the main library, is full of people chatting with their friends and Dan feels stupid, sitting at a table by himself. He didn&rsquo;t even have time to go back to his room to pick up his English books. \n</p><p>\n  He should have gotten coffee before coming, he thinks. It&rsquo;s the only thing keeping him going by this point.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He jumps, swivels in his chair and&ndash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Fuck, please don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re Phil.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  The boy standing there offers half a smile. &ldquo;Sorry to disappoint?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s leg starts bouncing again. His chest feels too tight. He tries to remember the topics for his ethics essay to distract himself, but all that does is make his breaths come faster, his mind go a little more hazy around the edges. He doesn&rsquo;t want to think about philosophy.\n</p><p>\n  Uni&rsquo;s making him not want to think about anything.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Hey, you okay?&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He forces his eyes open. Phil&rsquo;s sitting across from him now, his bag on the table. There&rsquo;s a coffee-coloured stain on his shirt.\n</p><p>\n  Dan helped put it there.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fail this fucking class,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let me fail.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil frowns. &ldquo;Why would I let you fail?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan shrugs, motioning vaguely towards Phil&rsquo;s chest. He&rsquo;s still not breathing properly.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Oh, this?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s smile quirks wider, happier, a little more crooked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;ll get my mum to wash it tonight and it&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He sounds so genuine that Dan manages to stop jittering for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Now, tell me about yourself?&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;What are you studying?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan manages half a smile back. &ldquo;Philosophy,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Since English clearly isn&rsquo;t my strong suit.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, and the tightness in Dan&rsquo;s chest starts to fade.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Did you get a chance to meet your tutor?&rdquo; asks Nathan after the next tutorial.\n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s hand is hovering on the doorknob. Everyone else has already left, and part of him wonders why he didn&rsquo;t rush out of his seat to avoid this conversation. He turns around, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Thank you for arranging it.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; says Nathan. &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll be able to help you?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  His smile grows a little more genuine, then. He tries not to think of Phil telling him about the time he forgot to study for his first exam because he was too busy binge-watching Buffy for the too-manieth time. Dan had told him, in turn, about the time he forgot to study for A-levels because of Mortal Kombat.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yeah, I think so.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Nathan just nods, and doesn&rsquo;t say another word as Dan slips out the door.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;So I looked at your essay,&rdquo; says Phil as he sits down at their next meeting.\n</p><p>\n  He booked a room in the English department this time, one with big windows open into the hallway that make Dan want to squirm in his seat every time someone walks by. Not that it matters what the English profs think of him. He&rsquo;s probably never going to come back after he&rsquo;s done this course.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;And?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil smiles. He drops Dan&rsquo;s essay, annotated in red ink, onto the table between them and his backpack onto the floor. There&rsquo;s a little Yoshi plushie hanging off the handle.\n</p><p>\n  Seeing it eases just a bit of Dan&rsquo;s anxiety.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I think you overanalyze.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Nathan said, too,&rdquo; says Dan. &ldquo;I, uh, don&rsquo;t really know what it means.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil chuckles, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem mocking. &ldquo;It is kinda vague, huh?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods. He reaches forward, grabbing the essay to read some of the notes Phil made, written in messier handwriting around Nathan&rsquo;s.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a philosophy major, right?&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He hums. &ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;That could explain it.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Oy!&rdquo; Dan looks up. Phil&rsquo;s leaning forward in his seat, grinning. &ldquo;Is that a jab at my major?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil lifts his hands, hitting himself in the forehead as he does, swiping his fringe away from his eyes. He laughs, and his tongue pokes out between his teeth, and something goes tight in Dan&rsquo;s chest.\n</p><p>\n  He tries not to think about it too much.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;Or maybe a little. I don&rsquo;t know. You just seem like someone prone to overthinking things. But that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He seems sincere. Dan can&rsquo;t bring himself to be upset about it.\n</p><p>\n  His finger drifts along the edge of his essay as he looks back down.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Fine, then tell me about this overanalyzing thing.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  By their fifth session, Dan knows more about Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He knows about his schedule, which leaves his Tuesday afternoons free at the same time as Dan&rsquo;s are and usually has them booking their meetings then. He knows he plays Mario games, like Dan does, and grew up playing something called Bubble Bobble that had Dan teasing him about being old.\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s favourite type of book is horror, Dan had learned last week, after wondering if it was the type of story they were analyzing that made the class so hard.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have done lit,&rdquo; Phil had said. &ldquo;All the character-driven plots would have driven me insane.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan had bit at his lip, offered a grin. &ldquo;I like them,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said. &ldquo;Even if I over-analyze them.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil had nudged their feet together under the table, back at the library that time. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why philosophy&rsquo;s perfect for you,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said, smiling.\n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;s smiling again today, over the edge of his syntax textbook, as Dan highlights passages in a short story called \n  <i>\n    The Yellow Wallpaper \n  </i>\n  they were asked to read. Dan has to force himself to stare at the text instead of the way Phil&rsquo;s eyes seem to shine in the too-bright light of the English Department.\n</p><p>\n  Dan drops the highlighter when he&rsquo;s finished reading. Phil&rsquo;s textbook is already closed and resting on his lap when he looks up.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t even looked over my work,&rdquo; says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I saw what you were doing.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a hint of laughter in Phil&rsquo;s eyes as he says it. He leans over the table, closer to Dan, and tugs the text towards him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you think of the ending?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan groans, letting his body collapse onto the table. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just \n  <i>\n    asking \n  </i>\n  me to overanalyze.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs, warm and happy, and knocks their knees together under the table. They&rsquo;re sitting closer today.\n</p><p>\n  That&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s changed over the past few weeks.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Unless you come up with a true conspiracy theory,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think you can overanalyze this ending. It&rsquo;s pretty abstract.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Pretty? It doesn&rsquo;t even make sense.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  He glares at the story, groans, and presses his head into his elbow to ignore it, just for a moment.\n</p><p>\n  Then Phil&rsquo;s hand is settling on his shoulder, squeezing gently.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to write an essay on this one, remember?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You just have to understand it enough for a quiz.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles even though Phil can&rsquo;t see it.\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s hand stays on his shoulder until Dan lifts his head and gets back to work.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  Their sixth meeting is back in the library.\n</p><p>\n  Phil shows up with his backpack on his shoulders and two cups of coffee in his hands. He sets one, the one with Dan&rsquo;s name scribbled across the side, in front of Dan, grinning. \n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Do you like caramel macchiatos?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan reaches for it. The cup is warm against his palm, the drink too hot when he takes a sip, but Dan smiles at the sweetness anyway. Of his drink, and, he realizes a moment after the feeling settles in his chest, of Phil, too.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I like them.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s smile only widens.\n</p><p>\n  He takes the seat next to Dan, humming around a sip of his own drink as their knees brush together under the table.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting chilly outside, you have to take care of yourself.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan nods, presses his leg back against Phil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I wanted to,&rdquo; says Phil. &ldquo;Besides, I have, uh, YouTube money to spend.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  His cheeks go a little pink, and Dan knows he should be taking out his essay outline to have Phil help him look it over, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to. Not when Phil&rsquo;s scratching at the black ink scribbled on the side of his cup with the tip of his fingernail, staring at the tabletop. Not when his leg is still pressed against Dan&rsquo;s.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;You do YouTube?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s chuckle is quiet, almost embarrassed. &ldquo;Just a bit. It doesn&rsquo;t actually make me enough money for Starbucks, but it&rsquo;s fun,&rdquo; he says.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I do too,&rdquo; says Dan, and Phil looks up, eyes wide. &ldquo;Not enough to make any money, but it&rsquo;s, uh fun. Yeah.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s awesome.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s smile has spread across his whole face again. &ldquo;What kind of videos do you make? Would I like them?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Um, how do you feel about self deprecating humour and attempts at self-analysis?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  His gaze flits over Dan&rsquo;s fringe, over his hoodie. &ldquo;Let me guess, you went through an emo phase, too?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if I resent or appreciate your use of the past tense,&rdquo; says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs so much his tongue sticks out between his teeth and his shoulder presses against Dan&rsquo;s.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has to try very hard not to let warmth bubble up in his chest again, without coffee to blame this time.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They meet up at Starbucks the eighth time.\n</p><p>\n  Dan has another caramel macchiato in his hands, his final essay laid out across the table between them. Phil has a croissant that has his fingers a little buttery, so he smudges oil on the paper whenever he points out an error. He picks it apart and pops bites into his mouth, grinning around them as Dan marks the recommendations in red pen.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much to correct this time,&rdquo; says Phil.\n</p><p>\n  He still has a little bit of food in his mouth. Dan thinks he should probably be more disgusted than he is.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I already corrected most of it,&rdquo; he says, smiling to hide the warmth he feels in his cheeks. \n</p><p>\n  Phil shrugs. &ldquo;Still, you&rsquo;re learning how to write for English instead of Philosophy,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting easier, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  The corner of his mouth is quirked up, his smile crooked. Dan doesn&rsquo;t realize he&rsquo;s drawn a slash of red ink across the page until Phil&rsquo;s eyes crinkle with a quiet giggle.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;End of the semester getting to you?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  His foot nudges Dan&rsquo;s. He blames how small the two-person Starbucks tables are, wedged into a corner like this with their long legs. It doesn&rsquo;t keep his chest from going warm, though. He&rsquo;s grown used to that, when Phil says something nice and he feels his whole body react to it.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; says Dan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not even done yet. We&rsquo;re just getting a break then it continues.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;With exams,&rdquo; says Phil. His nose crinkles, and Dan&rsquo;s stomach goes tight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty much a study break.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gonna procrastinate studying until the last day, I already know it.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s smile softens then. He takes another bite of his croissant, swallowing it with a sip of coffee, letting the silence linger. Dan takes a sip of his drink to fill it, to ignore the way his heart is suddenly pounding for no reason whatsoever.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Maybe I could remind you to study?&rdquo; says Phil. His cheeks have gone pink. He&rsquo;s fidgeting over the table so much Dan&rsquo;s fairly certain he&rsquo;s going to tear his bread to shreds. &ldquo;You know, if you give me your number.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan wants to quip that they&rsquo;d probably get too distracted talking to actually study, but his throat goes tight before he can. He hands over his phone, and tries not to let Phil see his smile. \n</p><p>\n  Tries not to admit he&rsquo;ll miss this, once his English class is over.\n</p><p>\n  Phil texts him, and grins when Dan&rsquo;s phone vibrates on the tabletop. He doesn&rsquo;t go to grab it at first, but Phil keeps staring at him, all wide eyes and expectation.\n</p><p>\n  Dan can&rsquo;t help but smile when he reads the messages.\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    Hi it&rsquo;s Phil ^.^ I was thinking we should meet up after your exam\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    if you want I mean\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  <i>\n    no pressure\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  He grins as he types back: \n  <i>\n    ill text u when i get out\n  </i>\n</p><p>\n  Phil clicks his tongue. &ldquo;Grammar, Dan. You&rsquo;ll never get your grade up like this.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s laugh rumbles as they both set their phones down to finish their drinks, to look over the rest of Dan&rsquo;s paper. \n</p><p>\n  Their legs are still brushing under the table.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They text over winter break.\n</p><p>\n  There&rsquo;s a conversation on the train about whether all the snow is melting as he gets further south. And another where Phil asks about his childhood bedroom, for whatever reason. Dan sends him a picture of Bangy just so he can sit down on the sofa and imagine the way Phil&rsquo;s eyes gleam when he&rsquo;s happy.\n</p><p>\n  He gets a message on Christmas morning that comes with a picture of Phil in his pyjamas, hugging a gift box to his chest. \n</p><p>\n  Dan smiles so wide his mum asks who he&rsquo;s texting in the lilted voice that makes his cheeks burn red. He hopes Phil can&rsquo;t tell in the photo he sends back.\n</p><p>\n  They do talk about schoolwork, sometimes, in timed study sessions. Dan&rsquo;s pretty sure he&rsquo;s too distracted to remember anything about Parfit or Kant or Plato, but he can&rsquo;t bring himself to care. Not when he needs to catch up on studying, alone late at night, and not when Phil admits studying together is a little distracting, too.\n</p><p>\n  One time, Phil makes a comment about how they&rsquo;ll need to play their new games together sometime.\n</p><p>\n  Another, Dan insinuates that Phil will see his room back at uni, and Phil doesn&rsquo;t protest. \n</p><p>\n  And there&rsquo;s a text on New Years, at midnight, that makes Dan&rsquo;s whole body go warm and giddy, just a little bit of alcohol in his stomach and a lot of thoughts he probably shouldn&rsquo;t have in his head.\n</p><p>\n  He&rsquo;s dreading finals when break ends, but he smiles the whole train ride home.\n</p><p>\n  &mdash;\n</p><p>\n  They meet up outside Starbucks after the final.\n</p><p>\n  Or, well, between Starbucks and the lecture hall when Dan wrote the test, because Phil&rsquo;s walking towards him, bag slung over one shoulders, bobble hat on his head. \n</p><p>\n  Dan&rsquo;s steps are bouncy. His shoulders feel light, his bag filled with only his wallet and pencil case, a whole semester of work falling away. He doesn&rsquo;t mean to when he reaches out, wraps an arm around Phil&rsquo;s shoulders, but Phil&rsquo;s arm curls at his waist and he&rsquo;s pretty sure it&rsquo;s okay.\n</p><p>\n  Phil&rsquo;s grinning. His cheeks are rosy, the tip of his nose red with winter cold. Dan smoothes a bare hand across his cheek. His heart is racing with the knowledge that he can, that Phil isn&rsquo;t flinching away.\n</p><p>\n  And he kisses him, soft and warm and grateful. \n</p><p>\n  Phil kisses back.\n</p><p>\n  His whole body feels warm when he pulls away, even as the wind sweeps under his jacket. His cheeks, he knows, are bright red. So are Phil&rsquo;s, though.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; says Dan.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;What?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mean to do that.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  The corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth quirks, eyes falling to the ground between them. His blush blooms up his cheeks, pinkening the tips of his ears more than the cold already had. Dan&rsquo;s not sure if it&rsquo;s intentional or caused by nerves when Phil squeezes his hip.\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did,&rdquo; says Phil. His voice is shaky. He draws away slowly, tucking his hands into his pockets and tilting his head so the bobble on his hat flops to the side. &ldquo;Still want coffee?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  &ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re not going to tutor me again.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n  Phil laughs and leads the way to Starbucks. \n</p>",
