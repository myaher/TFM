But, thanks to a long, twisted dispute dating back more than five decades, only one\u00a0<em>Captain Marvel</em> film is able to use the name \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d</p> <p>And if you think that sounds confusing, that\u2019s because it is. But let us explain how we wound up with this curious situation.</p> <p>First we need to rewind to 1938, when Superman created the superhero genre overnight and comic book publishers, eager to get into the burgeoning superhero market, began creating countless flash-in-the-pan heroes in an attempt to recapture the magic of Superman.</p> <p>Heroes such as Major Victory, Stardust the Super Wizard, and Air-Male and Stampy \u2014 yes, these are all real \u2014 would only last a few issues before being abandoned into the dustbin of comics history.</p> <p>But in 1939, writer Bill Parker and artist C.C. Beck created a hero that, for a time, would become the most popular superhero in the world.</p> <p>His name? Captain Marvel.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1135\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d4498c03ad1dee32870afce1291ff9bf\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/89c0738429c91b1beddd582a157b2894/tumblr_inline_pmwe9iekWV1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1135\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d4498c03ad1dee32870afce1291ff9bf\"/></figure><figcaption>Captain Marvel\u2019s first appearance in Fawcett Publications\u2019 <em>Whiz Comics</em> No. 2.</figcaption><p>Published by Fawcett Comics, Captain Marvel made his debut in <em>Whiz Comics</em> No. 2. Like many heroes of the time, Captain Marvel was gifted with flight and super-strength, but what made him unique was that beneath the red suit, yellow lightning bolt, and winning smile, he was really 12-year-old orphan Billy Batson.</p> <p>Chosen by the wizard Shazam, Billy would transform into Captain Marvel whenever he spoke the wizard\u2019s name. Granted the powers of the gods Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury, Captain Marvel was for a generation of children the purest form of wish-fulfillment.</p> <p>Among Captain Marvel\u2019s supporting cast was Billy\u2019s twin sister, Mary Marvel, and his best friend, Freddy Freeman, better known as Captain Marvel Jr.</p> <p>(Quick side note on Captain Marvel Jr.: His design would later inspire the fashion choices of none other than Elvis Presley.)</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"5157\" data-orig-width=\"3728\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7252b2e5c12e6b034eed6529aeeb8822\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a7a0a673e5ef1f037122b3c780bda5ed/tumblr_inline_pmwe9jIl0Q1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"5157\" data-orig-width=\"3728\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7252b2e5c12e6b034eed6529aeeb8822\"/></figure><figcaption>Elvis based his fashion on Captain Marvel Jr.</figcaption><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1381\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e38399631a0eb0e991bc2c618a25b71a\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/367718a1f4944aa9b9682ea11920a0a3/tumblr_inline_pmwe9ltPBR1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1381\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e38399631a0eb0e991bc2c618a25b71a\"/></figure><figcaption>Captain Marvel, Jr would inspire the look of Elvis Presley.</figcaption><p>Captain Marvel proved so popular, he starred in the very first motion picture based on a superhero, the 1941 live-action movie serial\u00a0<em>Adventures of Captain Marvel</em>, starring Frank Coghlan Jr. as Billy Batson and Tom Tyler as Captain Marvel. (It\u2019s also hands-down one of the best movie serials of all time.)</p> <p>But Captain Marvel\u2019s success story came to an end in 1952 when DC Comics \u2014 then called National Comics \u2014 won a four-year copyright-infringement legal battle against Fawcett. DC secured an out-of-court settlement from its rival; with comic sales already slumping after World War II, Fawcett closed up shop and <em>Captain Marvel</em> comics went out of print in 1953.</p> <p>In 1967, Marvel Comics, riding high with continuing success with heroes such as Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four, realized\u00a0Fawcett had let its Captain Marvel trademark lapse and had Stan Lee create a brand-new \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d Marvel Comics quickly trademarked the name, because why shouldn\u2019t <em>Marvel</em> Comics own Captain <em>Marvel</em>?</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4106\" data-orig-width=\"2741\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/01378d6a7cf9073a63b7495a9d83f056\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0aa67e5c8180f3d8958eae883a77f470/tumblr_inline_pmwe9mR41N1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4106\" data-orig-width=\"2741\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/01378d6a7cf9073a63b7495a9d83f056\"/></figure><figcaption>Marvel Comics\u2019 Captain Marvel was introduced in 1968.</figcaption><p>This Captain Marvel was a wholly new character, an alien named Mar-Vell sent by the Kree Empire to spy on Earth. Eventually, Mar-Vell abandoned his mission and sided with Earth to become one of its many protectors.</p> <p>While the character was never popular during this era, Marvel kept the character in publication in one form or another for decades to keep the trademark valid. This included stories such as Marvel Comics\u2019 1982 graphic novel <em>The Death of Captain Marvel</em>, which killed off Mar-Vell.</p> <p>Later that year Monica Rambeau was introduced as a black, female Captain Marvel. While Rambeau has a minor role in the upcoming Brie Larson film, the character was just the first of many characters who temporarily took on the \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d mantle.</p> <p>One of Mar-Vell\u2019s original supporting cast included United States Air Force pilot Carol Danvers. Created by Roy Thomas and Gene Colan in 1968, Danvers would be upgraded to superhero status in 1977 as Ms. Marvel after an explosion caused Mar-Vell\u2019s Kree DNA to fuse with hers. (Comics are weird.)</p> <p>Introduced as a socially progressive hero, Ms. Marvel had her fair share of up and downs, including an unfortunate storyline in which Danvers was brainwashed and impregnated by a villain from an alternate dimension. That child then grew up to be a copy of that villain and \u2026 You know what? I\u2019m not even sure how to explain this storyline without grossing everyone out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, DC Comics chose to revive the <em>original</em> Captain Marvel in 1973. Due to Marvel Comics\u2019 trademark, DC was unable to use the name \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d on the cover, and thus titled the series <em>Shazam!</em></p> <p>That title became so linked with the character that fans began using the monikers Shazam and Captain Marvel interchangeably. It wasn\u2019t until 2012 that DC Comics <em>officially</em> changed the original Captain Marvel\u2019s name to Shazam.</p> <p>But Shazam wasn\u2019t limited to just comics. From 1974 to 1977, Filmation produced a live-action TV series which featured Billy Batson and his \u201cMentor\u201d driving around the country in an RV.

But, thanks to a long, twisted dispute dating back more than five decades, only one\u00a0<em>Captain Marvel</em> film is able to use the name \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d</p> <p>And if you think that sounds confusing, that\u2019s because it is. But let us explain how we wound up with this curious situation.</p> <p>First we need to rewind to 1938, when Superman created the superhero genre overnight and comic book publishers, eager to get into the burgeoning superhero market, began creating countless flash-in-the-pan heroes in an attempt to recapture the magic of Superman.</p> <p>Heroes such as Major Victory, Stardust the Super Wizard, and Air-Male and Stampy \u2014 yes, these are all real \u2014 would only last a few issues before being abandoned into the dustbin of comics history.</p> <p>But in 1939, writer Bill Parker and artist C.C. Beck created a hero that, for a time, would become the most popular superhero in the world.</p> <p>His name? Captain Marvel.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1135\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d4498c03ad1dee32870afce1291ff9bf\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/89c0738429c91b1beddd582a157b2894/tumblr_inline_pmwe9iekWV1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1135\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d4498c03ad1dee32870afce1291ff9bf\"></figure><figcaption>Captain Marvel\u2019s first appearance in Fawcett Publications\u2019 <em>Whiz Comics</em> No. 2.</figcaption><p>Published by Fawcett Comics, Captain Marvel made his debut in <em>Whiz Comics</em> No. 2.

(It\u2019s also hands-down one of the best movie serials of all time.)</p> <p>But Captain Marvel\u2019s success story came to an end in 1952 when DC Comics \u2014 then called National Comics \u2014 won a four-year copyright-infringement legal battle against Fawcett. DC secured an out-of-court settlement from its rival; with comic sales already slumping after World War II, Fawcett closed up shop and <em>Captain Marvel</em> comics went out of print in 1953.</p> <p>In 1967, Marvel Comics, riding high with continuing success with heroes such as Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four, realized\u00a0Fawcett had let its Captain Marvel trademark lapse and had Stan Lee create a brand-new \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d Marvel Comics quickly trademarked the name, because why shouldn\u2019t <em>Marvel</em> Comics own Captain <em>Marvel</em>?</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4106\" data-orig-width=\"2741\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/01378d6a7cf9073a63b7495a9d83f056\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0aa67e5c8180f3d8958eae883a77f470/tumblr_inline_pmwe9mR41N1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4106\" data-orig-width=\"2741\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/01378d6a7cf9073a63b7495a9d83f056\"></figure><figcaption>Marvel Comics\u2019 Captain Marvel was introduced in 1968.</figcaption><p>This Captain Marvel was a wholly new character, an alien named Mar-Vell sent by the Kree Empire to spy on Earth. Eventually, Mar-Vell abandoned his mission and sided with Earth to become one of its many protectors.</p> <p>While the character was never popular during this era, Marvel kept the character in publication in one form or another for decades to keep the trademark valid. This included stories such as Marvel Comics\u2019 1982 graphic novel <em>The Death of Captain Marvel</em>, which killed off Mar-Vell.</p> <p>Later that year Monica Rambeau was introduced as a black, female Captain Marvel. While Rambeau has a minor role in the upcoming Brie Larson film, the character was just the first of many characters who temporarily took on the \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d mantle.</p> <p>One of Mar-Vell\u2019s original supporting cast included United States Air Force pilot Carol Danvers. Created by Roy Thomas and Gene Colan in 1968, Danvers would be upgraded to superhero status in 1977 as Ms. Marvel after an explosion caused Mar-Vell\u2019s Kree DNA to fuse with hers. (Comics are weird.)</p> <p>Introduced as a socially progressive hero, Ms. Marvel had her fair share of up and downs, including an unfortunate storyline in which Danvers was brainwashed and impregnated by a villain from an alternate dimension. That child then grew up to be a copy of that villain and \u2026 You know what? I\u2019m not even sure how to explain this storyline without grossing everyone out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, DC Comics chose to revive the <em>original</em> Captain Marvel in 1973. Due to Marvel Comics\u2019 trademark, DC was unable to use the name \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d on the cover, and thus titled the series <em>Shazam!</em></p> <p>That title became so linked with the character that fans began using the monikers Shazam and Captain Marvel interchangeably. It wasn\u2019t until 2012 that DC Comics <em>officially</em> changed the original Captain Marvel\u2019s name to Shazam.</p> <p>But Shazam wasn\u2019t limited to just comics. From 1974 to 1977, Filmation produced a live-action TV series which featured Billy Batson and his \u201cMentor\u201d driving around the country in an RV.
