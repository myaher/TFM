&ldquo;well, if you want, we could continue the tradition,&rdquo; he murmured, his cheek resting against your head.</p><p>&nbsp; you turned, peering up at him,&nbsp;&ldquo;shou-kun?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he hummed, eyes meeting yours.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;no offense, but you hate mornings.&rdquo; you giggled.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;but i don&rsquo;t hate you,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;&ldquo;i actually <i>love</i>&nbsp;you, so i wouldn&rsquo;t mind getting up early.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; your cheeks bloomed red, and he laughed quietly.&nbsp;&ldquo;i-i mean, if you really want to, we can?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he smiled,&nbsp;&ldquo;then i&rsquo;ll happily wake up with you and watch the snowfall as the sun rises.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; you pressed your lips to his cheek,&nbsp;&ldquo;i would like that, thank you, shou-kun.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;of course, (name).&rdquo;&nbsp;just before you could turn back to the snow, you felt his cool touch on your chin, and you looked up and to the side to face him. his lips caught yours in a kiss, one you smiled into; you cupped his cheek with your hand and pulled away,&nbsp;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re too cute.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;oh, but you&rsquo;re cuter,&rdquo; you replied with a cheeky grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;we should head back inside, i can&rsquo;t feel my toes anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he nodded, lifting you up with him; you squealed in surprise and hooked your arm around his neck with a blush.&nbsp;&ldquo;come on, i&rsquo;ll warm you up and then we can make breakfast.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;sounds like a plan.&rdquo;</p></p>",
