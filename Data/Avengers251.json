The following describes the life in the tower, its long recovery, PTSD, nightmares, fear of touch. The only one of the entire team with whom he is going to contact, and which he allows himself, is Natasha. She tries, practically does not depart from him, helps in all procedures, etc. Steve gets used to her comfort, constantly looking for her touches, hugs, can not sleep without her presence, etc. Gradually, he wakes up a sexual desire for Natasha, in what he is afraid to admit to her. Thinking that a girl like her would never be with a guy like him. Desirable description of any intimate procedures (prostate massage, washing, shaving, enema), which he does to Natasha, he is excited in the process and experiences an orgasm, for which later he is very ashamed. Natasha in the process of his recovery sees his more personal, vulnerable and weak side, with which he opens only to her. She begins to see not the strong Captain of America, but Steven Rogers - an uncertain, shy, vulnerable boy with a brave heart. At this time, she also has feelings for him. The main story is the period of restoration and comfort of Steve from Natasha. It is desirable to make the stronger, dominant and leading, Steve more humble, timid and needy of it. In bed, if I want, I would like to see sex with strapon. But without BDSM Natasha takes it with vanilla and gently, as for Steve this is the first sex in life. And, of course, in the end, a happy ending for this pair.</p>",

My best\nguess is that when you got so agitated today, your body needed to release the\nexcess energy and did so as an EMP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of EMPs,\u201d Tony interrupted, \u201chow are the\ncalculations going, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost complete, Mr. Stark.

I could handle the serum thing, really I could. But this is\nweird and different and I don\u2019t even know how my own body and emotions work\nanymore \u2013\u201d</p><p>Your venting was interrupted by another EMP, knocking out\npower to the entire lab.

How about you go get some sleep and we\u2019ll figure this out\ntomorrow.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and wiped at your eyes. \u201cThat sounds nice, Bruce.\nThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed a hug?\u201d He gave you a small smile.</p><p>After receiving a nod of permission, he wrapped his arms\naround you. You thanked him again and avoided Tony\u2019s eyes as you left the room.\nYou weren\u2019t sure why his comment had made you cry, but you figured you should\nprobably apologize for knocking out the power to his lab once you were feeling\nmore like yourself. It went on your mental list of things to do tomorrow, right\nafter asking Bruce for tips on how to control your emotions.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Steve poked his head into the room and spotted you in\nbed, snuggled under the covers. He held up a plastic grocery bag. \u201cI brought a\npeace offering. May I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you said quietly. He settled in next to you and\nhanded you a pint of your requested ice cream and a spoon. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m\nsorry for getting mad earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready forgiven. And I\u2019m sorry for crowding you,\u201d he replied,\nreaching to stroke your cheek. \u201cYou have a lot of changes to deal with and my\nhovering doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ll try to give you more space when you need it.\u201d</p><p>You dug into your ice cream and gave a happy sigh before\nfrowning. \u201cI cried on Tony and blacked out his lab. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going\non with my own body and I\u2019m finding it rather stressful.\u201d</p><p>To your surprise, Steve let out a little chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d he apologized, \u201cI just pictured it and I can\u2019t imagine Tony reacted\nthat well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce handled it,\u201d you replied with a small grin.</p><p>\u201cThat was probably a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was definitely a good thing,\u201d you agreed. You paused.\n\u201cWill you just\u2026hold me for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Steve assured you, pulling you into his arms.\nThe rest of your evening was spent snuggling and eating junk food while Steve\ntold you stories about growing up in the 40s. You were glad the day had ended\non a better note.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>Well, duh, that explained everything. You sighed at your\nruined underwear and reached for your box of tampons. You <i>would</i> have to develop a superpower affected by your emotions during\nPMS. You definitely owed Tony an apology.</p><p>As you padded down to get breakfast, you ran into Bucky and\nSam deep in the midst of an argument over whether or not candy corn could count\nas a vegetable.</p><p>\u201cGuys, it\u2019s June. Where did this argument even come from?\u201d</p><p>Bucky poked Sam in the shoulder. \u201cI keep some in my\nnightstand. Flyboy here keeps insisting that sugar doesn\u2019t count as a\nvegetable. But I read that sugar comes from sugarcane, which is a plant; ergo,\nit\u2019s a vegetable. Plus it has corn syrup in it! <i>Corn</i> syrup!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorn syrup is another type of sugar and sugar is not a\nvegetable!\u201d Sam shouted, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cIt takes everything\nplant out of it and just leaves \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaves are plants!\u201d Bucky cut in with a triumphant look.</p><p>\u201cOh for the love of \u2013 Y/N, help me out here.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the two of them. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m\nstaying as far away from this argument as I can. If you two are going to fight\nthrough breakfast I\u2019m taking mine to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll leave it for now, but I\u2019m not done with you\nyet,\u201d Sam said, glaring at Bucky. Bucky just smirked back at him.</p><p>Tony and Bruce were in the kitchen when the three of you\narrived. You figured now was probably the time to apologize, but Tony beat you\nto it.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019m sorry about last night. I made an unfair\nassumption and it wasn\u2019t right of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tony,\u201d you assured him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. I way\noverreacted; I know you didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did,\u201d he replied, chagrined. \u201cI just assumed that you\nwanted to join the team and eventually would.\u201d He came around the counter and\nplaced his hands on your shoulders. \u201cBut if you want a normal life with a house\nand a white picket fence and writing novels by a fireplace, then that\u2019s what\nyou should have. You deserve it, and you don\u2019t owe us wanting anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tony, I really appreciate that. But I really did\noverreact.\u201d You grimaced. \u201cI may have had a few hormones influencing my\nemotions. I should probably learn to keep those under control if getting upset\nis going to knock out all the power around me.\u201d</p><p>Bruce spoke up from his seat at the counter. \u201cWell, Tony was\nalready up late EMP-proofing the vital stuff in the tower last night, but I\ncould give you some meditation tools if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Bruce, I\u2019d like that,\u201d you replied with a smile.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t move. He was trying to process what he just overheard.\nYou hadn\u2019t denied what Tony said. You wanted a house with a picket fence and a\nquiet life, and there was no way he could give that to you. He loved you more\nthan life, but not even leaving the Avengers would change the fact that he was\nCaptain America, and enemies and the press would always seek him out.</p><p>Maybe for you to really be happy, he would have to let you\ngo\u2026</p>",

If you two are going to fight\nthrough breakfast I\u2019m taking mine to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll leave it for now, but I\u2019m not done with you\nyet,\u201d Sam said, glaring at Bucky. Bucky just smirked back at him.</p><p>Tony and Bruce were in the kitchen when the three of you\narrived. You figured now was probably the time to apologize, but Tony beat you\nto it.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019m sorry about last night. I made an unfair\nassumption and it wasn\u2019t right of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tony,\u201d you assured him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. I way\noverreacted; I know you didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did,\u201d he replied, chagrined. \u201cI just assumed that you\nwanted to join the team and eventually would.\u201d He came around the counter and\nplaced his hands on your shoulders. \u201cBut if you want a normal life with a house\nand a white picket fence and writing novels by a fireplace, then that\u2019s what\nyou should have. You deserve it, and you don\u2019t owe us wanting anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tony, I really appreciate that. But I really did\noverreact.\u201d You grimaced. \u201cI may have had a few hormones influencing my\nemotions. I should probably learn to keep those under control if getting upset\nis going to knock out all the power around me.\u201d</p><p>Bruce spoke up from his seat at the counter. \u201cWell, Tony was\nalready up late EMP-proofing the vital stuff in the tower last night, but I\ncould give you some meditation tools if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Bruce, I\u2019d like that,\u201d you replied with a smile.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t move. He was trying to process what he just overheard.\nYou hadn\u2019t denied what Tony said. You wanted a house with a picket fence and a\nquiet life, and there was no way he could give that to you. He loved you more\nthan life, but not even leaving the Avengers would change the fact that he was\nCaptain America, and enemies and the press would always seek him out.</p><p>Maybe for you to really be happy, he would have to let you\ngo\u2026</p>",

This is when Steve came in, and\nthis is when they started arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, question over here,\u201d you interrupted, waving a hand\nin their peripherals. \u201cAnyone want to tell me what the squiggly line means and\nwhy Steve being annoying affected it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your body\u2019s energy signature,\u201d Bruce explained.\n\u201cThe electrical energy spikes whenever you feel a surge of emotion. My best\nguess is that when you got so agitated today, your body needed to release the\nexcess energy and did so as an EMP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of EMPs,\u201d Tony interrupted, \u201chow are the\ncalculations going, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost complete, Mr. Stark. I\u2019ll let you know when they\u2019re\ndone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He turned to you and winked. \u201cGotta EMP-proof\nthe suit if we\u2019re gonna go out in the field together.\u201d</p><p>For some reason that broke you, and tears started pouring\ndown your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, honey, what did I say?\u201d Tony asked, looking\npanicked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, everyone keeps talking like I\u2019m joining the\nteam, first Nat and now you, and I just want a nice, normal life.\u201d You were\nsobbing now. \u201cI want to write novels and spend winter by a fireplace and have\ntwo kids and a picket fence, but my life got so strange so quickly and now it\u2019s\njust too much.

It went on your mental list of things to do tomorrow, right\nafter asking Bruce for tips on how to control your emotions.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Steve poked his head into the room and spotted you in\nbed, snuggled under the covers. He held up a plastic grocery bag. \u201cI brought a\npeace offering. May I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you said quietly. He settled in next to you and\nhanded you a pint of your requested ice cream and a spoon. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m\nsorry for getting mad earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready forgiven. And I\u2019m sorry for crowding you,\u201d he replied,\nreaching to stroke your cheek. \u201cYou have a lot of changes to deal with and my\nhovering doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ll try to give you more space when you need it.\u201d</p><p>You dug into your ice cream and gave a happy sigh before\nfrowning. \u201cI cried on Tony and blacked out his lab. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going\non with my own body and I\u2019m finding it rather stressful.\u201d</p><p>To your surprise, Steve let out a little chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry,\u201d he apologized, \u201cI just pictured it and I can\u2019t imagine Tony reacted\nthat well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce handled it,\u201d you replied with a small grin.</p><p>\u201cThat was probably a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was definitely a good thing,\u201d you agreed. You paused.\n\u201cWill you just\u2026hold me for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Steve assured you, pulling you into his arms.\nThe rest of your evening was spent snuggling and eating junk food while Steve\ntold you stories about growing up in the 40s. You were glad the day had ended\non a better note.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>Well, duh, that explained everything. You sighed at your\nruined underwear and reached for your box of tampons. You <i>would</i> have to develop a superpower affected by your emotions during\nPMS. You definitely owed Tony an apology.</p><p>As you padded down to get breakfast, you ran into Bucky and\nSam deep in the midst of an argument over whether or not candy corn could count\nas a vegetable.</p><p>\u201cGuys, it\u2019s June.

Bucky just smirked back at him.</p><p>Tony and Bruce were in the kitchen when the three of you\narrived. You figured now was probably the time to apologize, but Tony beat you\nto it.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m sorry about last night. I made an unfair\nassumption and it wasn&rsquo;t right of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Tony,&rdquo; you assured him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry too. I way\noverreacted; I know you didn&rsquo;t mean anything by it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I did,&rdquo; he replied, chagrined. &ldquo;I just assumed that you\nwanted to join the team and eventually would.&rdquo; He came around the counter and\nplaced his hands on your shoulders. &ldquo;But if you want a normal life with a house\nand a white picket fence and writing novels by a fireplace, then that&rsquo;s what\nyou should have. You deserve it, and you don&rsquo;t owe us wanting anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Tony, I really appreciate that. But I really did\noverreact.&rdquo; You grimaced. &ldquo;I may have had a few hormones influencing my\nemotions. I should probably learn to keep those under control if getting upset\nis going to knock out all the power around me.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce spoke up from his seat at the counter. &ldquo;Well, Tony was\nalready up late EMP-proofing the vital stuff in the tower last night, but I\ncould give you some meditation tools if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bruce, I&rsquo;d like that,&rdquo; you replied with a smile.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&nbsp;</p><p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t move. He was trying to process what he just overheard.\nYou hadn&rsquo;t denied what Tony said. You wanted a house with a picket fence and a\nquiet life, and there was no way he could give that to you. He loved you more\nthan life, but not even leaving the Avengers would change the fact that he was\nCaptain America, and enemies and the press would always seek him out.</p><p>Maybe for you to really be happy, he would have to let you\ngo&hellip;</p>",
