Sometimes for the sake of entity, sometimes for reasons you\u2019re not old enough to understand yet, but a lot of the time we just reach out and expect nothing in return. Isn\u2019t that strange? Isn\u2019t that weird?\" - David (Martian Child)\n</i>\n<p>-------------------------------------------\n\n<p><li><a href=\"http://sweetlittlepeapod.tumblr.com/post/144337107050/this-made-my-night-or-more-likely-it-made-my\">This made my life<3</a>\n<br>\n<li><a href=\"http://sweetlittlepeapod.tumblr.com/post/174544545650/an-amazing-day-meeting-two-of-the-loveliest-and\">Meeting two of my idols :)</a>\n<br>\n<li><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/sweetlittlepeapod\">My writing...enter at your own risk!</a>\n<br>",

        "body": "<h1>*Spoilers for Infinity War*</h1><p>I realize that I am probably going to sound like about a thousand other wailing fangirls, but I refuse to believe that Loki Odinson/Laufeyson died in Infinity War.</p><p>I, too, watched Thanos snap his neck, saying as he dropped him to the floor, &ldquo;no resurrections.&rdquo; We all heard Thor admit that it seemed that Loki&rsquo;s time was finally up. And let&rsquo;s be honest-not a single person went into that theater fully expecting Loki to live through the movie. We saw it coming. However, it is not the idea of Loki&rsquo;s death that doesn&rsquo;t sit right. It&rsquo;s the way it happened.</p><p>There are many, many ways they could have given Loki a proper exit from the MCU (if they are planning on keeping him dead anyway, but more on that later.) Many ways that seem to suit the god of Mischief and Lies much better. What we got, though, was Loki, evidently in a weakened state, attempting to stab Thanos-not only his former boss, but also the current wielder of an Infinity Stone. Loki would know full well how dangerous Infinity Stones are, and how deadly Thanos is on his own. He also would have known better than to attempt to stab him. I realize we all thought it would be funny if Loki went out trying to stab Thanos, but I never actually anticipated for that to be how Loki died in the movie.</p><p>Loki is the Trickster god. A master of deception and deceit, clever and cunning and a complete genius. So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that, no matter how dire the circumstances were, there is no way Loki would be stupid enough to stab the Mad Titan. Although, frustratingly, Loki&rsquo;s actual powers are never really discussed in the MCU-we see him performing different feats in every movie, from cryokinesis to illusion casting to shapeshifting and if they are going true to the comics with him being a sorcerer, then why not show the full extent of his powers?-it is obvious that he is powerful, a force to be reckoned with, and that he has quite a bit in his arsenal. Surely, if he intended to kill Thanos, he would have used one of his other abilities in order to actually give him a chance, because knowing the character he probably knew damn well that a knife was going to have almost no effect on Thanos, so why bother? Even in the comics, even when he actually DID die, Loki had carefully planned out everything, and his death was&hellip;well, worthy of Loki. Even when he lost his body, when he was dead, he had a plan that was already in motion before he even died. In every adaptation, one of the aspects of Loki that has changed very little is his self preservation. He always saves himself. </p><p>(I could honestly go on a roll about how out of character Loki was in both Infinity War and Ragnarok, but that is a lecture for another time.)</p><p>So, in Infinity War, he either didn&rsquo;t die at all (for all we know it could have been an illusion or something, he has shown that ability in the past as well), has a plan to bring himself back to life in some way (Kid Loki?
