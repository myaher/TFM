A few days after they return, Quill begins to notice how hard it was for Peter to die and then come back. He notices how much it has begun to affect him, and how much the pain has changed him. Peter Parker is quieter now. More serious. More reserved. He stands away from the rest of the crowd, and isn&rsquo;t the bubbly, overenthusiastic kid that Tony told Quill he was.</p><p>Quill wants to help. He approaches Peter one night when he finds him sitting outside the Avenger&rsquo;s base, looking up at the sky. In his hand, Quill has his walkman.
