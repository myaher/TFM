They have made their peace with the past, but the past hasn&rsquo;t made its peace with them, and one stormy night it comes to collect its due. <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18964024/chapters/45027022\"><b>Read on\u00a0Ao3</b></a><br/></p><hr><p>Rain swept sideways across the battlements of Storm\u2019s End, and lightning split the sky above the castle\u2019s single thrusting tower, but inside the Great Hall the Lord\u2019s guests were far too deep in their cups to notice. Half the Stormlands, it seemed, had pressed into the Hall to celebrate the marriage of Bethany Mertyns to Allesor Musgrave, the young Lord of Broad Arch. Laughter and ale had flowed freely the night through, and, though it was now well into the wee hours of the morning, neither storm nor festivities showed signs of abating any time soon.</p><p>The only person not enjoying themselves was the Lord Paramount himself. He hid it well, and to most of his guests he seemed jolly enough, seated at the high table, smiling as he watched the dancers, and every now and then calling out a new song for the musicians to play. But those who knew Gendry Baratheon best picked up on the tension in his broad shoulders, and how his smiles never seemed to reach those famous blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting too old for these kinds of things,\u201d Davos said, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his sleeve as he sank into the seat beside Gendry.</p><p>Gendry looked at him askance. \u201cYou looked well enough when you were dancing Malora Gower across the room just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn act, lad, all an act.

It wasn\u2019t a question. But then, Davos had always been able to read Gendry with irritating accuracy.</p><p>Gendry didn\u2019t bother denying it. Lifting his goblet, he drained its contents. \u201cShe should have been back by now.&rdquo; He dragged the back of his hand across his mouth. \u201cThree days to Sunspear. Three back. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not have noticed, but the weather hasn\u2019t been fair for sailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the last day or two. She should have been back four days ago, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps negotiations ran long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t she send a raven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you, lad. But I do know this: there\u2019s not a single person the world over more capable of taking care of themselves than that wife of yours.\u201d</p><p>Gendry knew it. He did. And yet\u2026</p><p>\u201cI just have this feeling.\u201d It was the tiredness, Gendry told himself. He never slept well when Arya was away. On top of that, he\u2019d been having strange dreams of late. In his dreams, shadowy figures crept down the halls of Storm\u2019s End. Gendry chased after them, but as soon as he caught up they disappeared like smoke between his fingers. Just dreams. That\u2019s all they are. Gendry shook his head, as though he could shake the thoughts from his mind the way a dog shook water from its fur. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m being stupid.\u201d</p><p>Standing abruptly, Gendry raised his goblet. \u201cStormlanders!\u201d he called. As one, every face in the Great Hall turned toward the high table. In the five years since he had arrived at Storm\u2019s End, Gendry had earned his people\u2019s respect, and their love besides. He was a lord, well and truly, but he had also never forgotten where he came from. He spoke to farmers and masons the same way he spoke to lords and maesters, and the people loved him for it.\u00a0</p><p>For a bastard who\u2019d spent most of his life without a name, he now had more than most: The Blue-eyed Buck. The Bull of Storm\u2019s End. The Lord of Steel. When they travelled abroad, Stormlanders boasted that their lord could swing a hammer better than the Smith himself. \u201cWe have gathered to celebrate the joining of two noble souls. To Bethany and Allesor. May yours be the happiest union in all the land.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUnfair, my lord,\u201d Allesor called, grinning, from the middle of the floor, where he stood with his arm looped around his new wife\u2019s waist. A stout, red haired young man with a broad face, Allesor was several inches shorter than his willowy Mertyns bride. \u201cEveryone knows there is no happier union than that of you and your Lady Wolf.\u201d</p><p>Gendry smile wryly. \u201cThe second happiest union, then.\u201d He lifted his goblet. \u201cTo Allesor and Bethany!\u201d</p><p>Echoes of <i>Allesor and Bethany</i> and <i>The Lord and Lady of Broad Arch</i> filled the room. As the shouts died down, the musicians took up their instruments once more, and soon the jaunty notes of <i>The Maids that Bloom in Spring </i>filled the hall, along with the clapping of hands and stomping of feet.</p><p>Gendry was reaching for the wine pitcher to refill his goblet when the doors to the Great Hall burst open and Steffon Penrose, the castellan\u2019s son, stumbled inside. A slender, green-eyed youth, Steffon was breathing hard, his pale locks dark with rain. Rivers of water ran off the hem of his cloak onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, lad?\u201d Davos asked.</p><p>\u201cA ship, m\u2019lord,\u201d Steffon gasped. \u201cA ship has foundered in the bay. I was on the battlements with Hugh. We saw it run aground on the shoals.\u201d</p><p><i>Fools</i>, Gendry thought. <i>Who would dare try the bay in weather such as this? </i>Ships frequently ran aground below the castle\u2014the sound wasn\u2019t called Shipbreaker Bay for nothing. But even the most inexperienced crews knew better than to come so close to shore during a storm.\u00a0</p><p>A question for another time, Gendry told himself. For now, they would do what they could for the poor souls.</p><p>\u201cAllard, Boros, Criston, with me,\u201d he said grimly, jumping down the dais. \u201cBring torches. We\u2019ll search the beach for survivors.\u201d</p><hr><p>A damp passageway led from the bowels of the Storm\u2019s End to the beach below. Long before they came to the tunnel\u2019s entrance, Gendry could heard the wind howling against the bars of the portcullis, and the crash of waves thrashing against the castle walls. Every few moments lightning flashed, filling the cavern with strange greenish light.</p><p>Boros raised the portcullis, the groan of rusted iron adding to the howling of the storm, and Gendry stepped out into the gale. He was soaked to the bone in seconds. The rain fell in great, droving sheets, frigid needles stabbing at Gendry\u2019s exposed skin. With the storm surge, the slip of land between the waterline and the cliffs had all but disappeared; only a narrow strip of beach remained.</p><p>In the distance, Gendry could just make out the outline of the doomed ship not far off shore. <i>Bloody fools</i>, Gendry thought again.<i> What could they have been thinking?</i></p><p>The men\u2019s torches flickered in and out, buffeted first this way, then that by the wind.</p><p>They found the first body by accident, Steffon tripping over it in the dark. At first Gendry took it for a clump of seaweed, then Boros lowered his torch and they saw it was a man lying face down in the sand.</p><p>\u201cHe alive?\u201d Criston said hesitantly. Gendry thought he knew the answer. Still, he knelt beside the body and rolled it gently onto its side.</p><p>What he saw made his heart turn to ice in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSeven hells,\u201d Boros swore. \u201cIt\u2019s Ben.\u201d</p><p>They all knew that face\u2014that wide nose, those pale green eyes. They belonged to Ben Horpe, the cook aboard the <i>Winter Wind</i>.</p><p>Arya\u2019s ship.</p><p>Not far from Ben, they found Alyn Harding, the ship\u2019s boatswain. A few feet away lay Alyn\u2019s twin brother, Aidyn.</p><p>The crew of the <i>Winter Wind </i>littered the beach like chaff tossed to the wind, and everyone of them was dead.</p><p>Gendry no longer felt the sting of the rain, no longer heard the wind howling in his ears. His entire being had been taken over by a single, all encompassing thought.</p><p><i>Arya.</i></p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Criston had to shout to make himself heard over the crashing of the waves. He\u2019d ventured away from the water, up toward the cliff face. Gendry turned toward him just in time for lightning to crack overhead, turning Criston\u2019s anguished face whiter than bone, and illuminating the small form that lay at his feet.</p><p><i>No.</i></p><p>Gendry\u2019s feet carried him to the cliffs of their own volition, and he collapsed beside Arya&rsquo;s body. Her face was turned away from him, dark hair plastered across her features, still he knew it was her. Even faceless, deep in the the seventh level of hell, he would have known her.</p><p>His hands hovered over her body, yet Gendry couldn\u2019t bring himself to touch her. If he touched her this would be real and it couldn\u2019t be real, it was just another dream, just another nightmare. Soon he would wake and Arya would be snoring softly beside him. But deep down Gendry knew this wasn\u2019t a dream. Knew there would be no waking from the nightmare, not this time.</p><p>Steffon fell to his knees by Arya\u2019s shoulders and dropped his ear to her chest.</p><p>Gendry had never been a man of faith, yet he found himself praying. <i>Mother, Father, Warrior, Crone</i>. <i>If I have ever done anything to offend you, I repent. Just don\u2019t take her from me.\u00a0</i></p><p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Steffon\u2019s head jerked up. His eyes were wide. \u201cShe\u2019s alive! She\u2019s alive, my lord!\u201d</p><p><i>Alive?</i></p><p>That was all Gendry needed to hear. Life snapped back into his body. He scooped Arya into his arms\u2014even soaking wet, she weighed nothing, less than nothing, how could something so precious take up so little space?\u2014and then he was running, back to the passageway, back to the castle, his wife clutched to his chest, and his heartbeat thrashing in his ears.</p>",

It wasn\u2019t a question. But then, Davos had always been able to read Gendry with irritating accuracy.</p><p>Gendry didn\u2019t bother denying it. Lifting his goblet, he drained its contents. \u201cShe should have been back by now.\u201d He dragged the back of his hand across his mouth. \u201cThree days to Sunspear. Three back.

But I do know this: there\u2019s not a single person the world over more capable of taking care of themselves than that wife of yours.\u201d</p><p>Gendry knew it. He did. And yet\u2026</p><p>\u201cI just have this feeling.\u201d It was the tiredness, Gendry told himself. He never slept well when Arya was away. On top of that, he\u2019d been having strange dreams of late. In his dreams, shadowy figures crept down the halls of Storm\u2019s End. Gendry chased after them, but as soon as he caught up they disappeared like smoke between his fingers. Just dreams. That\u2019s all they are. Gendry shook his head, as though he could shake the thoughts from his mind the way a dog shook water from its fur. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m being stupid.\u201d</p><p>Standing abruptly, Gendry raised his goblet. \u201cStormlanders!\u201d he called. As one, every face in the Great Hall turned toward the high table. In the five years since he had arrived at Storm\u2019s End, Gendry had earned his people\u2019s respect, and their love besides. He was a lord, well and truly, but he had also never forgotten where he came from. He spoke to farmers and masons the same way he spoke to lords and maesters, and the people loved him for it.\u00a0</p><p>For a bastard who\u2019d spent most of his life without a name, he now had more than most: The Blue-eyed Buck. The Bull of Storm\u2019s End. The Lord of Steel. When they travelled abroad, Stormlanders boasted that their lord could swing a hammer better than the Smith himself. \u201cWe have gathered to celebrate the joining of two noble souls. To Bethany and Allesor. May yours be the happiest union in all the land.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUnfair, my lord,\u201d Allesor called, grinning, from the middle of the floor, where he stood with his arm looped around his new wife\u2019s waist. A stout, red haired young man with a broad face, Allesor was several inches shorter than his willowy Mertyns bride. \u201cEveryone knows there is no happier union than that of you and your Lady Wolf.\u201d</p><p>Gendry smile wryly. \u201cThe second happiest union, then.\u201d He lifted his goblet. \u201cTo Allesor and Bethany!\u201d</p><p>Echoes of <i>Allesor and Bethany</i> and <i>The Lord and Lady of Broad Arch</i> filled the room. As the shouts died down, the musicians took up their instruments once more, and soon the jaunty notes of <i>The Maids that Bloom in Spring </i>filled the hall, along with the clapping of hands and stomping of feet.</p><p>Gendry was reaching for the wine pitcher to refill his goblet when the doors to the Great Hall burst open and Steffon Penrose, the castellan\u2019s son, stumbled inside. A slender, green-eyed youth, Steffon was breathing hard, his pale locks dark with rain. Rivers of water ran off the hem of his cloak onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, lad?\u201d Davos asked.</p><p>\u201cA ship, m\u2019lord,\u201d Steffon gasped. \u201cA ship has foundered in the bay. I was on the battlements with Hugh. We saw it run aground on the shoals.\u201d</p><p><i>Fools</i>, Gendry thought. <i>Who would dare try the bay in weather such as this? </i>Ships frequently ran aground below the castle\u2014the sound wasn\u2019t called Shipbreaker Bay for nothing. But even the most inexperienced crews knew better than to come so close to shore during a storm.\u00a0</p><p>A question for another time, Gendry told himself. For now, they would do what they could for the poor souls.</p><p>\u201cAllard, Boros, Criston, with me,\u201d he said grimly, jumping down the dais. \u201cBring torches. We\u2019ll search the beach for survivors.\u201d</p><hr><p>A damp passageway led from the bowels of the Storm\u2019s End to the beach below. Long before they came to the tunnel\u2019s entrance, Gendry could heard the wind howling against the bars of the portcullis, and the crash of waves thrashing against the castle walls. Every few moments lightning flashed, filling the cavern with strange greenish light.</p><p>Boros raised the portcullis, the groan of rusted iron adding to the howling of the storm, and Gendry stepped out into the gale. He was soaked to the bone in seconds. The rain fell in great, droving sheets, frigid needles stabbing at Gendry\u2019s exposed skin. With the storm surge, the slip of land between the waterline and the cliffs had all but disappeared; only a narrow strip of beach remained.</p><p>In the distance, Gendry could just make out the outline of the doomed ship not far off shore. <i>Bloody fools</i>, Gendry thought again.<i> What could they have been thinking?</i></p><p>The men\u2019s torches flickered in and out, buffeted first this way, then that by the wind.</p><p>They found the first body by accident, Steffon tripping over it in the dark. At first Gendry took it for a clump of seaweed, then Boros lowered his torch and they saw it was a man lying face down in the sand.</p><p>\u201cHe alive?\u201d Criston said hesitantly. Gendry thought he knew the answer. Still, he knelt beside the body and rolled it gently onto its side.</p><p>What he saw made his heart turn to ice in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSeven hells,\u201d Boros swore. \u201cIt\u2019s Ben.\u201d</p><p>They all knew that face\u2014that wide nose, those pale green eyes. They belonged to Ben Horpe, the cook aboard the <i>Winter Wind</i>.</p><p>Arya\u2019s ship.</p><p>Not far from Ben, they found Alyn Harding, the ship\u2019s boatswain. A few feet away lay Alyn\u2019s twin brother, Aidyn.</p><p>The crew of the <i>Winter Wind </i>littered the beach like chaff tossed to the wind, and everyone of them was dead.</p><p>Gendry no longer felt the sting of the rain, no longer heard the wind howling in his ears. His entire being had been taken over by a single, all encompassing thought.</p><p><i>Arya.</i></p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Criston had to shout to make himself heard over the crashing of the waves. He\u2019d ventured away from the water, up toward the cliff face. Gendry turned toward him just in time for lightning to crack overhead, turning Criston\u2019s anguished face whiter than bone, and illuminating the small form that lay at his feet.</p><p><i>No.</i></p><p>Gendry\u2019s feet carried him to the cliffs of their own volition, and he collapsed beside Arya\u2019s body. Her face was turned away from him, dark hair plastered across her features, still he knew it was her. Even faceless, deep in the the seventh level of hell, he would have known her.</p><p>His hands hovered over her body, yet Gendry couldn\u2019t bring himself to touch her. If he touched her this would be real and it couldn\u2019t be real, it was just another dream, just another nightmare. Soon he would wake and Arya would be snoring softly beside him. But deep down Gendry knew this wasn\u2019t a dream. Knew there would be no waking from the nightmare, not this time.</p><p>Steffon fell to his knees by Arya\u2019s shoulders and dropped his ear to her chest.</p><p>Gendry had never been a man of faith, yet he found himself praying. <i>Mother, Father, Warrior, Crone</i>. <i>If I have ever done anything to offend you, I repent. Just don\u2019t take her from me.\u00a0</i></p><p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Steffon\u2019s head jerked up. His eyes were wide. \u201cShe\u2019s alive! She\u2019s alive, my lord!\u201d</p><p><i>Alive?</i></p><p>That was all Gendry needed to hear. Life snapped back into his body. He scooped Arya into his arms\u2014even soaking wet, she weighed nothing, less than nothing, how could something so precious take up so little space?\u2014and then he was running, back to the passageway, back to the castle, his wife clutched to his chest, and his heartbeat thrashing in his ears.</p>",
