I had no idea that one of Spider-Man\u2019s villains from the comics was Jack O\u2019Lantern because I know nothing from the comics, though Ifound it and I had to add him in this thing, which is completly and utterly crack. Like, canon, who knows her?\u00a0</p><hr><p>The point was, Stephen couldn\u2019t refuse a damn thing to the kid. He didn\u2019t even know why, by now, maybe it was because of his stupid puppy eyes, maybe because please him was so easy that Stephen didn\u2019t have the heart to refuse him a thing, maybe because he grew to care about him during their stay in the Soul Dimension, he didn\u2019t know.<b><br/></b></p><p>What he knew, though, was that he wasn\u2019t going to listen to him and Harley, ever again. </p><p>The point was, the youngest of his boyfriend\u2019s kids &ndash; don\u2019t deny it, Tony, you adopted both of them by now &ndash; seemed really interested in the Mystical Arts, and Stephen had always been the kind of person to encourage academic interest. Which was the reason why most of the times Harley was with Stephen in the library. Sometimes, Peter joined them too. and that kind of familiarly grew easily on Stephen. Especially when Tony arrived at the Sanctum as well and then the four of them just portalled in the Tower. </p><p>But he usually didn\u2019t shove the two teenagers through the portal as he did that night. The point was: Wong wanted to bring a bit of Halloween spirit in Kamar-Taj and considering that it wasn\u2019t a Nepalese festivity he stated that the pumpkins should have been enough. Which brought Harley at the realization that Tony loved Halloween, and they should totally carve pumpkins. Which was perfectly fine with Stephen, as far as he wasn\u2019t involved. </p><p>But the teens decided to find a spell to help the Supreme Sorcerer to take part in this family ritual, and they succeed, in part. </p><p>Because neither of them spoke Latin. </p><p>\u201cBabe!\u201d Tony said the moment he saw the glowing portal opening in the middle of his workshop. Then, his whiskey brown eyes ran from his boyfriend\u2019s face to the two kids he was with. \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you always think we did something, Tones?\u201d Harley asked, and Stephen, despite being mad with them, couldn\u2019t help a smile. Harley reminded to him of a younger version of Stephen himself. </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m looking at Stephen\u2019s face right now. So, what happened?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing Mr Stark we just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey forced me into giving life to a sentient pumpkin,\u201d Stephen said, and he glanced at Tony when he heard that he was starting to laugh.</p><p>\u201cForced you, doc?\u201d Harley asked, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cSince when \u2018Hey this spell seems super cool because the pumpkin will stay lighted until you break it\u2019 is forcing?\u201d</p><p>The kid definitely spent too much time in Tony\u2019s company, that was for sure. He huffed and seated on one of the chairs in the workshop, his attention fully back on his mobile phone while Peter was trying to find a way to apologize, and Tony tried not to laugh his ass off. </p><p>\u201cSo, after that you perform a spell on a pumpkin what happened? It attacked Wong because he was eating a soup made of its siblings? Please, tell me you took a picture.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt would be on Instagram if that happened,\u201d Peter answered, a shy smile cracking through his worried expression now that it was clear that Tony didn&rsquo;t make a great deal out of it. \u201cNo\u2026 It just\u2026 Walked out from the Sanctum and now there\u2019s a sentient and friendly pumpkin around Greenwich Village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Shuri\u2019s text,\u201d Harley interrupted his friend. \u201cShe\u2019s at the Compound and we really have to go because our princess friend is waiting for us.\u201d </p><p>Stephen rolled his eyes at the ceiling. Of course, he forgot that T\u2019Challa and Shuri were throwing a Halloween party in Wakanda and pretty much everyone who was under twenty-five had been invited. And Stephen didn\u2019t expect for Tony to forbid them to go so, yeah, he and his boyfriend were going to spend Halloween night chasing for a sentient pumpkin, along with a sentient Cloak, very likely. That was his life now, not that Stephen was complaining. </p><p>&ndash;\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Not so surprisingly, the spell was stronger than Stephen guessed and the carved vegetable was probably smart enough to hide in plenty side because they walked around the Greenwich Village for almost two hours and there was no clarity of where it could have gone. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to not believe me but when the kids told me they were going in Wakanda for a party, I pictured a very different night,\u201d Tony said, after they decided that Central Park was a place as good as others to start their search for the missing pumpkin. \u201cAnd Jack O\u2019Lantern was not invited.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, thank you so much, not that he was having fun. And he was also half sure that if Wong would have known about it nobody would have saved him from a lecture on how to read the side effects of the spells, before practising them. It wasn\u2019t the first time either so it wasn\u2019t like he could completely blame that incident on Peter and Harley. </p><p>\u201cYou can go home if you want,\u201d Stephen said, even if he really hoped for his boyfriend to stay with him. Strange knew better and by now was sure that the moment they stopped the pumpkin he was going to study the spell and try to understand if it was the same that let the Cloak having its own mind. \u201cIt looks like this will take long enough.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head. \u201cNo shit, babe! I want to see you play the fairy godmother and turn the carriage back. Let\u2019s just hope it won\u2019t disappoint any Cinderella.\u201d </p><p>He smirked at him, and Stephen couldn\u2019t help but smile back at his boyfriend. At least, they would have a night just for the two of them, even if it wasn\u2019t what they both had hope for. </p><p>It took them almost four hours to find the pumpkin. A group of children had found it before and it didn\u2019t look pleased with all when it saw Stephen, trying to run away from its creator. And that was the moment when things started to go down profusely. </p><p>The thing kind of evolved, or went shopping. considering that was wearing a suit, and from where its hands were supposed to be it could shoot fireballs.</p><p>\u201cGreat, next time try not to give them magic, honey!\u201d Tony yelled, tapping the Arc Reactor and shooting at the thing the moment Stephen opened a couple of portals under the kids\u2019 feet and portalled them in a safe place. </p><p>The pumpkin should have understood that Stephen was the one who could bring it back to his vegetable form because it was attacking only the sorcerer, which was a huge problem because it forced Stephen to defend himself instead of practising the counterspell. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, now, if you keep it occupied\u2026\u201d</p><p>The next blast hit the thing head even if wasn\u2019t apparently enough to stop the creature, though the thing started to pay attention to Tony what was necessary to Stephen and the Cloak to block it. With a fast movement of his hands, he turned the thing back into the innocuous carved pumpkin which had been before. </p><p>By now, though, every person in the park seemed to have been attracted by the noises and the fires, and they probably thought it was a play or something because the crowd was cheer at them and a girl dressed as the Black Widow, and definitely the less shy in her Avenger-dressed friends, approached them. </p><p>\u201cWow, guys! That was a thing, and your costumes!\u201d Her eyes were shining and when she focused them on Tony they grew even bigger. \u201cOh my\u2026 Dude, is that the latest Ironman\u2019s suit? And the Cloak, it moved!\u201d</p><p>At that, Cloak itself decided to make her point even clearer and waved at the girl. And Stephen knew that his boyfriend\u2019s beautiful mind was working. Somehow, the sorcerer didn\u2019t like that idea, right now. But then Tony removed his helmet, and the girl, her friends and whoever was close enough to see his face recognized him. </p><p>\u201cOk, guys, y\u2019all are invited at the Stark Tower for having the greatest Avengers Halloween Party ever!\u201d Stephen\u2019s smile was soft, once he retrieved his suit and took Stephen\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you mind, babe, do you?\u201d</p><p>Stephen shook his head. Tony always liked to throw parties whenever he could and Stephen was happy in knowing that the alcohol wasn\u2019t any more the main attraction in those parties. He wanted to spend some time alone with Tony but he didn\u2019t really mind to postpone it. </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The day after, when Friday alerted them that Shuri, Harley, Peter, MJ and Ned arrived in the lobby, Stephen looked at his boyfriend\u2019s still asleep at his side, a small and secret smile painted on his lips. </p><p>\u201cWe should wake up,\u201d He whispered in Tony\u2019s ear. </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that they\u2019ll enter there\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys!\u201d MJ called, while from the kitchen came sounds of dishes and cutlery. \u201cYou\u2019d better get dress because if you don\u2019t show up in five minutes, Harley and I will finish Tony\u2019s Italian coffee.\u201d </p><p>That was enough for Tony to wake up completely. \u201cI hate her,\u201d he muttered, even if he was clearly joking. \u201cWhy have we approve our son dating her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because May will kill you if you try to tell Peter he can\u2019t date someone he likes,\u201d Stephen replied, and he had to force himself to get out of the bed. He wasn\u2019t tired, it was just that he didn\u2019t plan to leave the bed at least that day. </p><p>In the end, he decided it was useless to wait longer and walked out of Tony\u2019s bedroom. </p><p>\u201cHow was your party?\u201d Stephen asked, looking at the teenagers. </p><p>\u201cSuper cool, Mr Doctor!\u201d Peter said, and he couldn\u2019t actually stay still on the chair. They all looked pretty on a sugar height but it was probably because of the time zone and the fact that they probably just had some coffees before leaving. </p><p>\u201cAnd yours?\u201d Shuri\u2019s tone was smug to pair her smile. </p><p>\u201cOh, we chased Jack O\u2019Lantern all night long,\u201d Tony answered. \u201cAnd then we discovered that you can\u2019t give a moral compass to a conscious pumpkin so we had to fight it. Oh, we also invited a lot of people there and had a party until ass-o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, Tony, whatever you say, we just asked to see Steph blush,\u201d Harley replied, though the sorcerer was sure he was disappointed by the fact that he didn\u2019t blush at all. </p>",

I had no idea that one of Spider-Man\u2019s villains from the comics was Jack O\u2019Lantern because I know nothing from the comics, though Ifound it and I had to add him in this thing, which is completly and utterly crack. Like, canon, who knows her?\u00a0</p><hr><p>The point was, Stephen couldn\u2019t refuse a damn thing to the kid. He didn\u2019t even know why, by now, maybe it was because of his stupid puppy eyes, maybe because please him was so easy that Stephen didn\u2019t have the heart to refuse him a thing, maybe because he grew to care about him during their stay in the Soul Dimension, he didn\u2019t know.<b><br></b></p><p>What he knew, though, was that he wasn\u2019t going to listen to him and Harley, ever again. </p><p>The point was, the youngest of his boyfriend\u2019s kids \u2013 don\u2019t deny it, Tony, you adopted both of them by now \u2013 seemed really interested in the Mystical Arts, and Stephen had always been the kind of person to encourage academic interest. Which was the reason why most of the times Harley was with Stephen in the library. Sometimes, Peter joined them too. and that kind of familiarly grew easily on Stephen. Especially when Tony arrived at the Sanctum as well and then the four of them just portalled in the Tower. </p><p>But he usually didn\u2019t shove the two teenagers through the portal as he did that night. The point was: Wong wanted to bring a bit of Halloween spirit in Kamar-Taj and considering that it wasn\u2019t a Nepalese festivity he stated that the pumpkins should have been enough. Which brought Harley at the realization that Tony loved Halloween, and they should totally carve pumpkins. Which was perfectly fine with Stephen, as far as he wasn\u2019t involved. </p><p>But the teens decided to find a spell to help the Supreme Sorcerer to take part in this family ritual, and they succeed, in part. </p><p>Because neither of them spoke Latin. </p><p>\u201cBabe!\u201d Tony said the moment he saw the glowing portal opening in the middle of his workshop. Then, his whiskey brown eyes ran from his boyfriend\u2019s face to the two kids he was with. \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you always think we did something, Tones?\u201d Harley asked, and Stephen, despite being mad with them, couldn\u2019t help a smile. Harley reminded to him of a younger version of Stephen himself. </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m looking at Stephen\u2019s face right now. So, what happened?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing Mr Stark we just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey forced me into giving life to a sentient pumpkin,\u201d Stephen said, and he glanced at Tony when he heard that he was starting to laugh.</p><p>\u201cForced you, doc?\u201d Harley asked, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cSince when \u2018Hey this spell seems super cool because the pumpkin will stay lighted until you break it\u2019 is forcing?\u201d</p><p>The kid definitely spent too much time in Tony\u2019s company, that was for sure. He huffed and seated on one of the chairs in the workshop, his attention fully back on his mobile phone while Peter was trying to find a way to apologize, and Tony tried not to laugh his ass off. </p><p>\u201cSo, after that you perform a spell on a pumpkin what happened? It attacked Wong because he was eating a soup made of its siblings? Please, tell me you took a picture.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt would be on Instagram if that happened,\u201d Peter answered, a shy smile cracking through his worried expression now that it was clear that Tony didn\u2019t make a great deal out of it. \u201cNo\u2026 It just\u2026 Walked out from the Sanctum and now there\u2019s a sentient and friendly pumpkin around Greenwich Village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Shuri\u2019s text,\u201d Harley interrupted his friend. \u201cShe\u2019s at the Compound and we really have to go because our princess friend is waiting for us.\u201d </p><p>Stephen rolled his eyes at the ceiling. Of course, he forgot that T\u2019Challa and Shuri were throwing a Halloween party in Wakanda and pretty much everyone who was under twenty-five had been invited. And Stephen didn\u2019t expect for Tony to forbid them to go so, yeah, he and his boyfriend were going to spend Halloween night chasing for a sentient pumpkin, along with a sentient Cloak, very likely. That was his life now, not that Stephen was complaining. </p><p>\u2013\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Not so surprisingly, the spell was stronger than Stephen guessed and the carved vegetable was probably smart enough to hide in plenty side because they walked around the Greenwich Village for almost two hours and there was no clarity of where it could have gone. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to not believe me but when the kids told me they were going in Wakanda for a party, I pictured a very different night,\u201d Tony said, after they decided that Central Park was a place as good as others to start their search for the missing pumpkin. \u201cAnd Jack O\u2019Lantern was not invited.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, thank you so much, not that he was having fun. And he was also half sure that if Wong would have known about it nobody would have saved him from a lecture on how to read the side effects of the spells, before practising them. It wasn\u2019t the first time either so it wasn\u2019t like he could completely blame that incident on Peter and Harley. </p><p>\u201cYou can go home if you want,\u201d Stephen said, even if he really hoped for his boyfriend to stay with him. Strange knew better and by now was sure that the moment they stopped the pumpkin he was going to study the spell and try to understand if it was the same that let the Cloak having its own mind. \u201cIt looks like this will take long enough.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head. \u201cNo shit, babe! I want to see you play the fairy godmother and turn the carriage back. Let\u2019s just hope it won\u2019t disappoint any Cinderella.\u201d </p><p>He smirked at him, and Stephen couldn\u2019t help but smile back at his boyfriend. At least, they would have a night just for the two of them, even if it wasn\u2019t what they both had hope for. </p><p>It took them almost four hours to find the pumpkin. A group of children had found it before and it didn\u2019t look pleased with all when it saw Stephen, trying to run away from its creator. And that was the moment when things started to go down profusely. </p><p>The thing kind of evolved, or went shopping. considering that was wearing a suit, and from where its hands were supposed to be it could shoot fireballs.</p><p>\u201cGreat, next time try not to give them magic, honey!\u201d Tony yelled, tapping the Arc Reactor and shooting at the thing the moment Stephen opened a couple of portals under the kids\u2019 feet and portalled them in a safe place. </p><p>The pumpkin should have understood that Stephen was the one who could bring it back to his vegetable form because it was attacking only the sorcerer, which was a huge problem because it forced Stephen to defend himself instead of practising the counterspell. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, now, if you keep it occupied\u2026\u201d</p><p>The next blast hit the thing head even if wasn\u2019t apparently enough to stop the creature, though the thing started to pay attention to Tony what was necessary to Stephen and the Cloak to block it. With a fast movement of his hands, he turned the thing back into the innocuous carved pumpkin which had been before. </p><p>By now, though, every person in the park seemed to have been attracted by the noises and the fires, and they probably thought it was a play or something because the crowd was cheer at them and a girl dressed as the Black Widow, and definitely the less shy in her Avenger-dressed friends, approached them. </p><p>\u201cWow, guys! That was a thing, and your costumes!\u201d Her eyes were shining and when she focused them on Tony they grew even bigger. \u201cOh my\u2026 Dude, is that the latest Ironman\u2019s suit? And the Cloak, it moved!\u201d</p><p>At that, Cloak itself decided to make her point even clearer and waved at the girl. And Stephen knew that his boyfriend\u2019s beautiful mind was working. Somehow, the sorcerer didn\u2019t like that idea, right now. But then Tony removed his helmet, and the girl, her friends and whoever was close enough to see his face recognized him. </p><p>\u201cOk, guys, y\u2019all are invited at the Stark Tower for having the greatest Avengers Halloween Party ever!\u201d Stephen\u2019s smile was soft, once he retrieved his suit and took Stephen\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you mind, babe, do you?\u201d</p><p>Stephen shook his head. Tony always liked to throw parties whenever he could and Stephen was happy in knowing that the alcohol wasn\u2019t any more the main attraction in those parties. He wanted to spend some time alone with Tony but he didn\u2019t really mind to postpone it. </p><p>\u2013</p><p>The day after, when Friday alerted them that Shuri, Harley, Peter, MJ and Ned arrived in the lobby, Stephen looked at his boyfriend\u2019s still asleep at his side, a small and secret smile painted on his lips. </p><p>\u201cWe should wake up,\u201d He whispered in Tony\u2019s ear. </p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that they\u2019ll enter there\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys!\u201d MJ called, while from the kitchen came sounds of dishes and cutlery. \u201cYou\u2019d better get dress because if you don\u2019t show up in five minutes, Harley and I will finish Tony\u2019s Italian coffee.\u201d </p><p>That was enough for Tony to wake up completely. \u201cI hate her,\u201d he muttered, even if he was clearly joking. \u201cWhy have we approve our son dating her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because May will kill you if you try to tell Peter he can\u2019t date someone he likes,\u201d Stephen replied, and he had to force himself to get out of the bed. He wasn\u2019t tired, it was just that he didn\u2019t plan to leave the bed at least that day. </p><p>In the end, he decided it was useless to wait longer and walked out of Tony\u2019s bedroom. </p><p>\u201cHow was your party?\u201d Stephen asked, looking at the teenagers. </p><p>\u201cSuper cool, Mr Doctor!\u201d Peter said, and he couldn\u2019t actually stay still on the chair. They all looked pretty on a sugar height but it was probably because of the time zone and the fact that they probably just had some coffees before leaving. </p><p>\u201cAnd yours?\u201d Shuri\u2019s tone was smug to pair her smile. </p><p>\u201cOh, we chased Jack O\u2019Lantern all night long,\u201d Tony answered. \u201cAnd then we discovered that you can\u2019t give a moral compass to a conscious pumpkin so we had to fight it. Oh, we also invited a lot of people there and had a party until ass-o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, Tony, whatever you say, we just asked to see Steph blush,\u201d Harley replied, though the sorcerer was sure he was disappointed by the fact that he didn\u2019t blush at all. </p>",

Peter meets Loki for the first time, and suddenly all the memories are coming back to him. </p><p>Warnings: my friend cried ig </p><p><a href=\"http://samskablamsarts.tumblr.com/post/177918903513/uncle-ben-died-in-the-battle-of-new-york-pass-it\">PART 1</a> | PART 3</p><p>*****</p><p>After the painful interaction he just had, Peter moved to Tony\u2019s lab and waited for him there. Not only did he want to stray away from Loki, but he wanted to be alone as he remembered the painful memories their conversation had brought up. Tears flew down the boys face, and he silently sobbed until Jarvis alerted the building of Tony\u2019s arrival. Peter then washed the sorrow off his face.</p><p>When Tony walked in the room, Peter could feel his own breathing hitch. He hunched over the counter he stayed sat by, acting as if he had been working on homework, or even working on upgrades for his web shooters. </p><p>Peter heard Tony take several steps in the room, most likely towards the hunched kid. \u201cSo, you snuck in?\u201d He softly joked, but Peter jumped high in fear. The kid seemed frantic, and he wouldn\u2019t even face himself towards Tony. It was concerned, but Peter had odd habits that Tony had gotten used to. \u201cGuess that\u2019s a yes in \u2018Youngster,\u2019\u201d Tony added. </p><p>Peter smacked himself with the palm of his hand. \u201cOh my god. Oh my god. Mr. Stark, I\u2019m so sorry, I forgot I\u2019m not supposed to be in here without you. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was filled with quivers, disappointment and despair. Tony made a noise of concern, which caused Peter to feel worse than he probably should. </p><p>\u201cKid, you good there?\u201d Tony questioned, stepping towards Peter until he stood beside him;then, he placed a hand on the teen\u2019s soldier. Peter tensed up at the warm feeling of Tony\u2019s hand, not because he felt uncomfortable, but because it was oddly comforting. \u201cDid school suck today or something?\u201d Tony\u2019s question semi-snapped Peter out of the touch\u2019s trance. </p><p>Peter tried moving away from Tony, but something told him he shouldn\u2019t. Something kept him shaking under Tony\u2019s fatherly touch. It could\u2019ve been the fact that Peter knew he needed comfort at the moment, he knew he needed to cry his eyes out, but he couldn\u2019t. A pitiful strain rose up Peter\u2019s throat, begging for a loud, unwelcoming cry. With a small whimper, that he hoped Tony didn\u2019t notice, Peter shot away the feeling. He took a deep breath, put on the best smile he could (despite still keeping his face turned away from Tony) and said, \u201cno. I just\u2026 saw a cat with her kittens outside. I felt bad for them, and I guess my empathy got the best of me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>Tony hummed in response, and Peter almost felt relieved. Everything felt better the moment Tony released Peter, as he was able to relax and forget the whole reason why Peter had been shaky in the first place. </p><p>There was the quick sound of a drawer open, the loudness causing Peter to turn himself to the noise. It was Tony; he was taking out blueprints. </p><p>\u201cThe Patriotic Grandpa requested new equipment, and Bruce has been busy, so I figured you could help me with them,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cOh. So, the Avengers are getting new stuff, and I get to help with it?\u201d Peter would normally be shaking with the ecstatic feeling of being able to make equipment for the Avengers, but somebody made Peter dread this. Something told him he was going to fail, and that his equipment wouldn\u2019t help in saving people. Just like\u2026 </p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s kinda what I was implying,\u201d Tony began, \u201cand you also get to listen to me talk about the design points for like\u2026 fifteen minutes.\u201d Peter did just that. Patiently he sat, anxiously listening to Tony as he quickly spoke about all the new equipment. Everybody was getting new uniforms, and several others getting new upgrades to any of their current weapons (and Natasha was getting a stress ball, because they\u2019re all tired of her choking Steve.). </p><p>There was one last blueprint though, one that Tony noticeably hesitated in acknowledging. </p><p>\u201cSo, lastly, Thor convinced me to help design Loki a new\u2026 spear\u2026 or whatever it is. Either that, or just give him back the original one. Don\u2019t know why, but-,&ldquo; Peter interrupted Tony with a sudden sob that broke out in his throat, causing him start coughing wetly. Tears built up in Peter\u2019s eyes, begging to make their way out. \u201cPeter?\u201d From what Peter could see Tony had tears in his eyes too. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 why would you consider&hellip; that?\u201d Peter had trouble making words out, as they all were forced into a saddened slur and sloppy sobs. \u201cHe\u2026 so many died\u2026 he hurt them, killed them, and you don\u2019t even know if he cares.\u201d </p><p>*****</p><p><i>Peter couldn\u2019t forget that day; nobody could. It was the day Loki terrorized New York, killed hundreds, maybe a bit more with the possible suicides caused from the day. Ben had to work that day, then he\u2019d come home and join a young Peter and May for dinner. When Loki appeared, nobody expected it, and it was a fright to all. The day Ben\u2026 didn\u2019t come home.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Slightly violent shaking and a hug snapped Peter away from his memories. More glistening tears were streaming down his swollen cheeks. He hid his reddened face in the fabric of Tony\u2019s jacket. This feeling was familiar, not the embarrassment of crying in public, but the same feeling Tony&rsquo;s hug gave him. </p><p>\u201cKid. Hey Kid, Peter. Peter, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter heard from the older man. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t focus on anything else Tony was saying. The teen felt as if he was in a drunken haze, there but barely conscious, like his mind was exiting his body to go on vacation. All Peter knew is that he held onto Tony as he drifted back off into his memories. </p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d he heard Tony say one last time. </p><p>*****</p><p><i>\u201cPeter. Peter\u2026 Peter! Wake up, let\u2019s eat with Ben before he leaves.\u201d May said to her sleepy five-year-old nephew, who\u2019d been refusing to get out of bed. All she got was another whine before the child registered what May had said, and suddenly he flew himself out of bed. </i></p><p><i>May laughed.

He ran up and jumped on his lap, giving the man a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to eat without family!\u201d Peter puffed out his cheeks to seem more intimidating, but it only made his face look adorable and red. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not supposed to sleep while the family is eating,\u201d Ben bantered; Peter wasn\u2019t going to try to argue against that logic.

It was a normal day.</i></p><p><i>The young child almost didn\u2019t let his uncle leave. \u201cHe can\u2019t go!\u201d Peter protested, \u201che\u2019ll be gone too long, and I don\u2019t want him gone!\u201d May tried to coax the young child from being upset and forcing Ben to stay, but Peter couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cWhat if something happened to him?! What if the bad guys got to him?!\u201d Peter was practically screeching at this point. He couldn\u2019t stand the possibility of Ben being gone an entire day, and of him not coming home. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, then Iron Man or Captain America will save me. Don\u2019t worry, Pete. Anyways, Manhattan is a safe place,\u201d Ben\u2019s soothing words were able to calm Peter enough for Ben to leave. His aunt and uncle kissed each other a goodbye; Peter stuck his tongue out in disgust. It was a normal day. </i></p><p><i>Hours later, May and Peter were on the couch, Peter playing with a new \u2018Crystal Making Kit\u2019 and May awaiting her call from Ben. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d Peter asked, looking up from the formation of fake crystals in front of him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s probably getting out late,\u201d May responded calmly. Peter shrugged, he believed May was telling the truth. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly, the phone began to ring. It was Ben. Peter ran in a attempt to answer the phone first, but the height of the counter was his downfall. Peter watched closely as May talked on the phone with Ben. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy turn on the news? What?\u201d Peter heard May say from the kitchen. He was just as confused as May, and even more confused when the channels changed to their local News Channel. May suddenly fell silent at the sight. </i></p><p><i>\u201cClose to Manhattan, there was a live murder of several men. The suspect has yet to give his name, but we suspect that this is a being we shall not mess with. He seems to be wearing a suit with- wait, his\u2026 He just\u2026 okay. He\u2019s wearing what appears to be gold armor, green cape and a helmet with two horns. God, what type of man is this? Oh, Our cameras have just arrived. Please, be cautious around this man if you\u2019re in the area of Manhattan.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cMay?\u201d Peter was shaking. He didn\u2019t know how to perceive this information or the look of panic on May\u2019s face. \u201cMay!\u201d He ran up to her, tugging her leg, begging for some sort of response.</i></p><p><i>He heard May say one thing, \u201cplease, just\u2026 get home safe.\u201d It was to Ben. Peter, with tears streaming down his pinkish cheeks, silently admitted defeat and stared at the TV.</i></p><p><i>The cameras had already switched to the large amount of commotion being caused by the unnamed man. He held a golden spear with a glowing, blue stone in the middle. It matched the aesthetic of his armor, but as Peter watched the man, he didn\u2019t feel the satisfying tingle he normally feels at such a match. </i></p><p><i>Peter jumped as the man used the spear to create a big ray of light, or he thought it was just light. As he saw a car get flipped from the magic of the spear, he realized it definitely wasn\u2019t light. </i></p><p><i>There was a crowd of people around this man, running, screaming, they were all terrified. Hell, Peter wasn\u2019t there and he was sweating like he\u2019d just fled the scene. Among those people, Peter was able to spot a familiar tan jacket, but he ignored it, because there could be other people wearing the same jacket. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly, the unnamed man was trapping the group inside of multiple versions of himself. \u201cKneel before me,\u201d the man said. He teleported away from the area, leaving a clone. Then, he was in front of the crowd, angry, ready to kill them all. \u201cI said KNEEL!\u201d Peter almost felt compelled to get on his knee, but his childish fear stopped him. </i></p><p><i>Peter didn\u2019t listen to the monologue the man gave. He was more worried about May, who was still holding the phone to her ear, but silently. She was shaking, even crying. After Peter had heard the man finish speaking, May held her hand to her mouth. She was still staring at the TV. \u201cBen! Ben! Don\u2019t do it!\u201d She suddenly shouted. Peter looked at the TV again. Ben was there.</i></p><p><i>Ben, his uncle that he loved dearly, was standing in the sea of the kneeling people who were too scared to say anything. The man causing the chaos even looked shocked, almost impressed. They stared at each other, different goals in their eyes. It was a battle that we all knew who would lose. Ben gave a monologue of his own, one that made Peter walk closer to the TV, observe it more. He was proud of his uncle, that was until the light of dangerous man\u2019s spear began to form again.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBen?\u201d Peter questioned to the news being broadcasted, \u201cwhy won\u2019t you move?\u201d Now, Peter was crying. </i></p><p><i>The light blasted from the spear, hitting Ben dead on. Peter could\u2019ve sworn he saw red mixed with the blue light.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBen\u2026\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cBen!\u201d He said again, but louder. May then pulled Peter into a hug. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?!\u201d He screamed through the sobs. </i></p><p><i>Ben had promised that one of Peter\u2019s idols would\u2019ve saved them, but he lied. Captain America landed seconds after Ben\u2019s obliteration, and because of that, Ben didn\u2019t come home that night. He\u2019d never come home. </i></p><p><i>Peter suddenly preferred Iron Man over Captain America. He tried to think about the man in metal armor as he mourned for his uncle, but that couldn\u2019t keep him from thinking about the man\u2019s last moments alive. </i></p><p><i>That day definitely wasn\u2019t a normal day.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Peter hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d recalled his memories aloud until he heard Tony apologizing frantically and felt the way the older man shook as he held Peter. \u201cGosh, if I had known\u2026 damn\u2026\u201d Tony said. Peter could hear the panic in his mentor\u2019s voice, which only made him feel worse than he already had. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mr. Stark. It just\u2026 doesn\u2019t make me feel too good, makes me feel dusty,\u201d Peter said dryly. </p><p>\u201cI know how it feels, kid. I\u2019ll just set aside the blueprints, so nobody has to worry about\u2026 that day happening again,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>Peter looked up at Tony, who had a painful attempt of a smile plastered on his face and nodded as if he were five again. They released each other from their comforting hugs, so Tony could organize his pile of projects. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go wash off,\u201d Peter muttered; before Tony could reply, Peter was already gone. </p><p>He stared himself in the mirror as he washed the salty tear stains from his cheeks, which were still warm from embarrassment. His hand glided down to his cracked lips, suffering from the dehydration of crying. Both his cheeks and lips matched the rest of his skin, red, irritated and suffering from his depressing trip down memory lane. Peter figured he would possibly break out in some places later, so he cleaned his skin the best he could and rejoined Stark. </p><p>As he walked alone, he thought of several things to himself. Would Tony force Thor to find another place for Loki to stay? Would he just keep Loki as far away from Peter as possible? Every possibility stayed in his mind, even the ones that involved the worst possible outcome for everybody around them. </p><p>He walked into the lab and was immediately greeted by Bruce, who arrived while Peter was cleaning himself. Normally, Peter was taken aback whenever he saw Bruce, but today he was too tired to. All he did was greet Bruce back.</p><p>\u201cHey kid!\u201d Peter heard from the opposite side of the lab. \u201cWe\u2019re adding extra legs to your iron suit. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a little gift from the tooth fairy.\u201d </p><p>A small grin formed on Peter\u2019s face. \u201cOkay, Mr. Stark!\u201d </p><p>Peter didn\u2019t need to worry about his fears or Loki at the moment, all he needed to do was make sure his only fatherly figure didn\u2019t stab himself with a metal spider leg. </p><p><a href=\"http://samskablamsarts.tumblr.com/post/177918903513/uncle-ben-died-in-the-battle-of-new-york-pass-it\">PART 1</a> | PART 3</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQEILDjFjHcSS_OE5dAH3A\">@t-rexhighfives</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/matyIMD9c9Q41DoajyinJmw\">@evil-9enguin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVlof0gNFCZ-oUjmcuYbJfg\">@loki-redeemed-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYu5RwZwilUukdzIGHVs0pA\">@whimsicalbarnes</a> </p>",

Peter meets Loki for the first time, and suddenly all the memories are coming back to him. </p><p>Warnings: my friend cried ig </p><p><a href=\"http://samskablamsarts.tumblr.com/post/177918903513/uncle-ben-died-in-the-battle-of-new-york-pass-it\">PART 1</a> | PART 3</p><p>*****</p><p>After the painful interaction he just had, Peter moved to Tony\u2019s lab and waited for him there. Not only did he want to stray away from Loki, but he wanted to be alone as he remembered the painful memories their conversation had brought up. Tears flew down the boys face, and he silently sobbed until Jarvis alerted the building of Tony\u2019s arrival. Peter then washed the sorrow off his face.</p><p>When Tony walked in the room, Peter could feel his own breathing hitch. He hunched over the counter he stayed sat by, acting as if he had been working on homework, or even working on upgrades for his web shooters. </p><p>Peter heard Tony take several steps in the room, most likely towards the hunched kid. \u201cSo, you snuck in?\u201d He softly joked, but Peter jumped high in fear. The kid seemed frantic, and he wouldn\u2019t even face himself towards Tony. It was concerned, but Peter had odd habits that Tony had gotten used to. \u201cGuess that\u2019s a yes in \u2018Youngster,\u2019\u201d Tony added. </p><p>Peter smacked himself with the palm of his hand. \u201cOh my god. Oh my god. Mr. Stark, I\u2019m so sorry, I forgot I\u2019m not supposed to be in here without you. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was filled with quivers, disappointment and despair. Tony made a noise of concern, which caused Peter to feel worse than he probably should. </p><p>\u201cKid, you good there?\u201d Tony questioned, stepping towards Peter until he stood beside him;then, he placed a hand on the teen\u2019s soldier. Peter tensed up at the warm feeling of Tony\u2019s hand, not because he felt uncomfortable, but because it was oddly comforting. \u201cDid school suck today or something?\u201d Tony\u2019s question semi-snapped Peter out of the touch\u2019s trance. </p><p>Peter tried moving away from Tony, but something told him he shouldn\u2019t. Something kept him shaking under Tony\u2019s fatherly touch. It could\u2019ve been the fact that Peter knew he needed comfort at the moment, he knew he needed to cry his eyes out, but he couldn\u2019t. A pitiful strain rose up Peter\u2019s throat, begging for a loud, unwelcoming cry. With a small whimper, that he hoped Tony didn\u2019t notice, Peter shot away the feeling. He took a deep breath, put on the best smile he could (despite still keeping his face turned away from Tony) and said, \u201cno. I just\u2026 saw a cat with her kittens outside. I felt bad for them, and I guess my empathy got the best of me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>Tony hummed in response, and Peter almost felt relieved. Everything felt better the moment Tony released Peter, as he was able to relax and forget the whole reason why Peter had been shaky in the first place. </p><p>There was the quick sound of a drawer open, the loudness causing Peter to turn himself to the noise. It was Tony; he was taking out blueprints. </p><p>\u201cThe Patriotic Grandpa requested new equipment, and Bruce has been busy, so I figured you could help me with them,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cOh. So, the Avengers are getting new stuff, and I get to help with it?\u201d Peter would normally be shaking with the ecstatic feeling of being able to make equipment for the Avengers, but somebody made Peter dread this. Something told him he was going to fail, and that his equipment wouldn\u2019t help in saving people. Just like\u2026 </p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s kinda what I was implying,\u201d Tony began, \u201cand you also get to listen to me talk about the design points for like\u2026 fifteen minutes.\u201d Peter did just that. Patiently he sat, anxiously listening to Tony as he quickly spoke about all the new equipment. Everybody was getting new uniforms, and several others getting new upgrades to any of their current weapons (and Natasha was getting a stress ball, because they\u2019re all tired of her choking Steve.). </p><p>There was one last blueprint though, one that Tony noticeably hesitated in acknowledging. </p><p>\u201cSo, lastly, Thor convinced me to help design Loki a new\u2026 spear\u2026 or whatever it is. Either that, or just give him back the original one. Don\u2019t know why, but-,\u201c Peter interrupted Tony with a sudden sob that broke out in his throat, causing him start coughing wetly. Tears built up in Peter\u2019s eyes, begging to make their way out. \u201cPeter?\u201d From what Peter could see Tony had tears in his eyes too. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 why would you consider\u2026 that?\u201d Peter had trouble making words out, as they all were forced into a saddened slur and sloppy sobs. \u201cHe\u2026 so many died\u2026 he hurt them, killed them, and you don\u2019t even know if he cares.\u201d </p><p>*****</p><p><i>Peter couldn\u2019t forget that day; nobody could. It was the day Loki terrorized New York, killed hundreds, maybe a bit more with the possible suicides caused from the day. Ben had to work that day, then he\u2019d come home and join a young Peter and May for dinner. When Loki appeared, nobody expected it, and it was a fright to all. The day Ben\u2026 didn\u2019t come home.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Slightly violent shaking and a hug snapped Peter away from his memories. More glistening tears were streaming down his swollen cheeks. He hid his reddened face in the fabric of Tony\u2019s jacket. This feeling was familiar, not the embarrassment of crying in public, but the same feeling Tony\u2019s hug gave him. </p><p>\u201cKid. Hey Kid, Peter. Peter, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter heard from the older man. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t focus on anything else Tony was saying. The teen felt as if he was in a drunken haze, there but barely conscious, like his mind was exiting his body to go on vacation. All Peter knew is that he held onto Tony as he drifted back off into his memories. </p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d he heard Tony say one last time. </p><p>*****</p><p><i>\u201cPeter. Peter\u2026 Peter! Wake up, let\u2019s eat with Ben before he leaves.\u201d May said to her sleepy five-year-old nephew, who\u2019d been refusing to get out of bed. All she got was another whine before the child registered what May had said, and suddenly he flew himself out of bed. </i></p><p><i>May laughed. It was a normal day. </i></p><p><i>Peter ran up to his uncle, who\u2019d already began eating himself.

Peter meets Loki for the first time, and suddenly all the memories are coming back to him. </p><p>Warnings: my friend cried ig </p><p><a href=\"http://samskablamsarts.tumblr.com/post/177918903513/uncle-ben-died-in-the-battle-of-new-york-pass-it\">PART 1</a> | PART 3</p><p>*****</p><p>After the painful interaction he just had, Peter moved to Tony\u2019s lab and waited for him there. Not only did he want to stray away from Loki, but he wanted to be alone as he remembered the painful memories their conversation had brought up. Tears flew down the boys face, and he silently sobbed until Jarvis alerted the building of Tony\u2019s arrival. Peter then washed the sorrow off his face.</p><p>When Tony walked in the room, Peter could feel his own breathing hitch. He hunched over the counter he stayed sat by, acting as if he had been working on homework, or even working on upgrades for his web shooters. </p><p>Peter heard Tony take several steps in the room, most likely towards the hunched kid. \u201cSo, you snuck in?\u201d He softly joked, but Peter jumped high in fear. The kid seemed frantic, and he wouldn\u2019t even face himself towards Tony. It was concerned, but Peter had odd habits that Tony had gotten used to. \u201cGuess that\u2019s a yes in \u2018Youngster,\u2019\u201d Tony added. </p><p>Peter smacked himself with the palm of his hand. \u201cOh my god. Oh my god. Mr. Stark, I\u2019m so sorry, I forgot I\u2019m not supposed to be in here without you. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was filled with quivers, disappointment and despair. Tony made a noise of concern, which caused Peter to feel worse than he probably should. </p><p>\u201cKid, you good there?\u201d Tony questioned, stepping towards Peter until he stood beside him;then, he placed a hand on the teen\u2019s soldier. Peter tensed up at the warm feeling of Tony\u2019s hand, not because he felt uncomfortable, but because it was oddly comforting. \u201cDid school suck today or something?\u201d Tony\u2019s question semi-snapped Peter out of the touch\u2019s trance. </p><p>Peter tried moving away from Tony, but something told him he shouldn\u2019t. Something kept him shaking under Tony\u2019s fatherly touch. It could\u2019ve been the fact that Peter knew he needed comfort at the moment, he knew he needed to cry his eyes out, but he couldn\u2019t. A pitiful strain rose up Peter\u2019s throat, begging for a loud, unwelcoming cry. With a small whimper, that he hoped Tony didn\u2019t notice, Peter shot away the feeling. He took a deep breath, put on the best smile he could (despite still keeping his face turned away from Tony) and said, \u201cno. I just\u2026 saw a cat with her kittens outside. I felt bad for them, and I guess my empathy got the best of me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>Tony hummed in response, and Peter almost felt relieved. Everything felt better the moment Tony released Peter, as he was able to relax and forget the whole reason why Peter had been shaky in the first place. </p><p>There was the quick sound of a drawer open, the loudness causing Peter to turn himself to the noise. It was Tony; he was taking out blueprints. </p><p>\u201cThe Patriotic Grandpa requested new equipment, and Bruce has been busy, so I figured you could help me with them,\u201d Tony said.</p><p>\u201cOh. So, the Avengers are getting new stuff, and I get to help with it?\u201d Peter would normally be shaking with the ecstatic feeling of being able to make equipment for the Avengers, but somebody made Peter dread this. Something told him he was going to fail, and that his equipment wouldn\u2019t help in saving people. Just like\u2026 </p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s kinda what I was implying,\u201d Tony began, \u201cand you also get to listen to me talk about the design points for like\u2026 fifteen minutes.\u201d Peter did just that. Patiently he sat, anxiously listening to Tony as he quickly spoke about all the new equipment. Everybody was getting new uniforms, and several others getting new upgrades to any of their current weapons (and Natasha was getting a stress ball, because they\u2019re all tired of her choking Steve.). </p><p>There was one last blueprint though, one that Tony noticeably hesitated in acknowledging. </p><p>\u201cSo, lastly, Thor convinced me to help design Loki a new\u2026 spear\u2026 or whatever it is. Either that, or just give him back the original one. Don\u2019t know why, but-,\u201c Peter interrupted Tony with a sudden sob that broke out in his throat, causing him start coughing wetly. Tears built up in Peter\u2019s eyes, begging to make their way out. \u201cPeter?\u201d From what Peter could see Tony had tears in his eyes too. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 why would you consider\u2026 that?\u201d Peter had trouble making words out, as they all were forced into a saddened slur and sloppy sobs. \u201cHe\u2026 so many died\u2026 he hurt them, killed them, and you don\u2019t even know if he cares.\u201d </p><p>*****</p><p><i>Peter couldn\u2019t forget that day; nobody could. It was the day Loki terrorized New York, killed hundreds, maybe a bit more with the possible suicides caused from the day. Ben had to work that day, then he\u2019d come home and join a young Peter and May for dinner. When Loki appeared, nobody expected it, and it was a fright to all. The day Ben\u2026 didn\u2019t come home.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Slightly violent shaking and a hug snapped Peter away from his memories. More glistening tears were streaming down his swollen cheeks. He hid his reddened face in the fabric of Tony\u2019s jacket. This feeling was familiar, not the embarrassment of crying in public, but the same feeling Tony\u2019s hug gave him. </p><p>\u201cKid. Hey Kid, Peter. Peter, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Peter heard from the older man. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t focus on anything else Tony was saying. The teen felt as if he was in a drunken haze, there but barely conscious, like his mind was exiting his body to go on vacation. All Peter knew is that he held onto Tony as he drifted back off into his memories. </p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d he heard Tony say one last time. </p><p>*****</p><p><i>\u201cPeter. Peter\u2026 Peter! Wake up, let\u2019s eat with Ben before he leaves.\u201d May said to her sleepy five-year-old nephew, who\u2019d been refusing to get out of bed. All she got was another whine before the child registered what May had said, and suddenly he flew himself out of bed. </i></p><p><i>May laughed. It was a normal day. </i></p><p><i>Peter ran up to his uncle, who\u2019d already began eating himself. He ran up and jumped on his lap, giving the man a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to eat without family!\u201d Peter puffed out his cheeks to seem more intimidating, but it only made his face look adorable and red. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not supposed to sleep while the family is eating,\u201d Ben bantered; Peter wasn\u2019t going to try to argue against that logic. Instead, he climbed himself off of Ben and to his own seat, though he did need some help from May. </i></p><p><i>Peter swung his legs and giggled as they ate together. It was a normal day.</i></p><p><i>The young child almost didn\u2019t let his uncle leave. \u201cHe can\u2019t go!\u201d Peter protested, \u201che\u2019ll be gone too long, and I don\u2019t want him gone!\u201d May tried to coax the young child from being upset and forcing Ben to stay, but Peter couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cWhat if something happened to him?! What if the bad guys got to him?!\u201d Peter was practically screeching at this point. He couldn\u2019t stand the possibility of Ben being gone an entire day, and of him not coming home. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, then Iron Man or Captain America will save me. Don\u2019t worry, Pete. Anyways, Manhattan is a safe place,\u201d Ben\u2019s soothing words were able to calm Peter enough for Ben to leave. His aunt and uncle kissed each other a goodbye; Peter stuck his tongue out in disgust. It was a normal day. </i></p><p><i>Hours later, May and Peter were on the couch, Peter playing with a new \u2018Crystal Making Kit\u2019 and May awaiting her call from Ben. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d Peter asked, looking up from the formation of fake crystals in front of him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s probably getting out late,\u201d May responded calmly. Peter shrugged, he believed May was telling the truth. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly, the phone began to ring. It was Ben. Peter ran in a attempt to answer the phone first, but the height of the counter was his downfall. Peter watched closely as May talked on the phone with Ben. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy turn on the news? What?\u201d Peter heard May say from the kitchen. He was just as confused as May, and even more confused when the channels changed to their local News Channel. May suddenly fell silent at the sight. </i></p><p><i>\u201cClose to Manhattan, there was a live murder of several men. The suspect has yet to give his name, but we suspect that this is a being we shall not mess with. He seems to be wearing a suit with- wait, his\u2026 He just\u2026 okay. He\u2019s wearing what appears to be gold armor, green cape and a helmet with two horns. God, what type of man is this? Oh, Our cameras have just arrived. Please, be cautious around this man if you\u2019re in the area of Manhattan.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cMay?\u201d Peter was shaking. He didn\u2019t know how to perceive this information or the look of panic on May\u2019s face. \u201cMay!\u201d He ran up to her, tugging her leg, begging for some sort of response.</i></p><p><i>He heard May say one thing, \u201cplease, just\u2026 get home safe.\u201d It was to Ben. Peter, with tears streaming down his pinkish cheeks, silently admitted defeat and stared at the TV.</i></p><p><i>The cameras had already switched to the large amount of commotion being caused by the unnamed man. He held a golden spear with a glowing, blue stone in the middle. It matched the aesthetic of his armor, but as Peter watched the man, he didn\u2019t feel the satisfying tingle he normally feels at such a match. </i></p><p><i>Peter jumped as the man used the spear to create a big ray of light, or he thought it was just light. As he saw a car get flipped from the magic of the spear, he realized it definitely wasn\u2019t light. </i></p><p><i>There was a crowd of people around this man, running, screaming, they were all terrified. Hell, Peter wasn\u2019t there and he was sweating like he\u2019d just fled the scene. Among those people, Peter was able to spot a familiar tan jacket, but he ignored it, because there could be other people wearing the same jacket. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly, the unnamed man was trapping the group inside of multiple versions of himself. \u201cKneel before me,\u201d the man said. He teleported away from the area, leaving a clone. Then, he was in front of the crowd, angry, ready to kill them all. \u201cI said KNEEL!\u201d Peter almost felt compelled to get on his knee, but his childish fear stopped him. </i></p><p><i>Peter didn\u2019t listen to the monologue the man gave. He was more worried about May, who was still holding the phone to her ear, but silently. She was shaking, even crying. After Peter had heard the man finish speaking, May held her hand to her mouth. She was still staring at the TV. \u201cBen! Ben! Don\u2019t do it!\u201d She suddenly shouted. Peter looked at the TV again. Ben was there.</i></p><p><i>Ben, his uncle that he loved dearly, was standing in the sea of the kneeling people who were too scared to say anything. The man causing the chaos even looked shocked, almost impressed. They stared at each other, different goals in their eyes. It was a battle that we all knew who would lose. Ben gave a monologue of his own, one that made Peter walk closer to the TV, observe it more. He was proud of his uncle, that was until the light of dangerous man\u2019s spear began to form again.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBen?\u201d Peter questioned to the news being broadcasted, \u201cwhy won\u2019t you move?\u201d Now, Peter was crying. </i></p><p><i>The light blasted from the spear, hitting Ben dead on. Peter could\u2019ve sworn he saw red mixed with the blue light.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBen\u2026\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cBen!\u201d He said again, but louder. May then pulled Peter into a hug. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?!\u201d He screamed through the sobs. </i></p><p><i>Ben had promised that one of Peter\u2019s idols would\u2019ve saved them, but he lied. Captain America landed seconds after Ben\u2019s obliteration, and because of that, Ben didn\u2019t come home that night. He\u2019d never come home. </i></p><p><i>Peter suddenly preferred Iron Man over Captain America. He tried to think about the man in metal armor as he mourned for his uncle, but that couldn\u2019t keep him from thinking about the man\u2019s last moments alive. </i></p><p><i>That day definitely wasn\u2019t a normal day.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Peter hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d recalled his memories aloud until he heard Tony apologizing frantically and felt the way the older man shook as he held Peter. \u201cGosh, if I had known\u2026 damn\u2026\u201d Tony said. Peter could hear the panic in his mentor\u2019s voice, which only made him feel worse than he already had. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mr. Stark. It just\u2026 doesn\u2019t make me feel too good, makes me feel dusty,\u201d Peter said dryly. </p><p>\u201cI know how it feels, kid. I\u2019ll just set aside the blueprints, so nobody has to worry about\u2026 that day happening again,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>Peter looked up at Tony, who had a painful attempt of a smile plastered on his face and nodded as if he were five again. They released each other from their comforting hugs, so Tony could organize his pile of projects. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go wash off,\u201d Peter muttered; before Tony could reply, Peter was already gone. </p><p>He stared himself in the mirror as he washed the salty tear stains from his cheeks, which were still warm from embarrassment. His hand glided down to his cracked lips, suffering from the dehydration of crying. Both his cheeks and lips matched the rest of his skin, red, irritated and suffering from his depressing trip down memory lane. Peter figured he would possibly break out in some places later, so he cleaned his skin the best he could and rejoined Stark. </p><p>As he walked alone, he thought of several things to himself. Would Tony force Thor to find another place for Loki to stay? Would he just keep Loki as far away from Peter as possible? Every possibility stayed in his mind, even the ones that involved the worst possible outcome for everybody around them. </p><p>He walked into the lab and was immediately greeted by Bruce, who arrived while Peter was cleaning himself. Normally, Peter was taken aback whenever he saw Bruce, but today he was too tired to. All he did was greet Bruce back.</p><p>\u201cHey kid!\u201d Peter heard from the opposite side of the lab. \u201cWe\u2019re adding extra legs to your iron suit. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a little gift from the tooth fairy.\u201d </p><p>A small grin formed on Peter\u2019s face. \u201cOkay, Mr. Stark!\u201d </p><p>Peter didn\u2019t need to worry about his fears or Loki at the moment, all he needed to do was make sure his only fatherly figure didn\u2019t stab himself with a metal spider leg. </p><p><a href=\"http://samskablamsarts.tumblr.com/post/177918903513/uncle-ben-died-in-the-battle-of-new-york-pass-it\">PART 1</a> | PART 3</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQEILDjFjHcSS_OE5dAH3A\">@t-rexhighfives</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/matyIMD9c9Q41DoajyinJmw\">@evil-9enguin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVlof0gNFCZ-oUjmcuYbJfg\">@loki-redeemed-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYu5RwZwilUukdzIGHVs0pA\">@whimsicalbarnes</a> </p></p>",

Instead, he climbed himself off of Ben and to his own seat, though he did need some help from May. </i></p><p><i>Peter swung his legs and giggled as they ate together. It was a normal day.</i></p><p><i>The young child almost didn&rsquo;t let his uncle leave. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; Peter protested, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be gone too long, and I don&rsquo;t want him gone!&rdquo; May tried to coax the young child from being upset and forcing Ben to stay, but Peter couldn&rsquo;t stop crying. &ldquo;What if something happened to him?! What if the bad guys got to him?!&rdquo; Peter was practically screeching at this point. He couldn&rsquo;t stand the possibility of Ben being gone an entire day, and of him not coming home. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, then Iron Man or Captain America will save me. Don&rsquo;t worry, Pete. Anyways, Manhattan is a safe place,&rdquo; Ben&rsquo;s soothing words were able to calm Peter enough for Ben to leave. His aunt and uncle kissed each other a goodbye; Peter stuck his tongue out in disgust. It was a normal day. </i></p><p><i>Hours later, May and Peter were on the couch, Peter playing with a new &lsquo;Crystal Making Kit&rsquo; and May awaiting her call from Ben. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ben?&rdquo; Peter asked, looking up from the formation of fake crystals in front of him. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably getting out late,&rdquo; May responded calmly. Peter shrugged, he believed May was telling the truth. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly, the phone began to ring. It was Ben. Peter ran in a attempt to answer the phone first, but the height of the counter was his downfall. Peter watched closely as May talked on the phone with Ben. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why turn on the news? What?&rdquo; Peter heard May say from the kitchen. He was just as confused as May, and even more confused when the channels changed to their local News Channel. May suddenly fell silent at the sight. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Close to Manhattan, there was a live murder of several men. The suspect has yet to give his name, but we suspect that this is a being we shall not mess with. He seems to be wearing a suit with- wait, his&hellip; He just&hellip; okay. He&rsquo;s wearing what appears to be gold armor, green cape and a helmet with two horns. God, what type of man is this? Oh, Our cameras have just arrived. Please, be cautious around this man if you&rsquo;re in the area of Manhattan.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;May?&rdquo; Peter was shaking. He didn&rsquo;t know how to perceive this information or the look of panic on May&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;May!&rdquo; He ran up to her, tugging her leg, begging for some sort of response.</i></p><p><i>He heard May say one thing, &ldquo;please, just&hellip; get home safe.&rdquo; It was to Ben. Peter, with tears streaming down his pinkish cheeks, silently admitted defeat and stared at the TV.</i></p><p><i>The cameras had already switched to the large amount of commotion being caused by the unnamed man. He held a golden spear with a glowing, blue stone in the middle. It matched the aesthetic of his armor, but as Peter watched the man, he didn&rsquo;t feel the satisfying tingle he normally feels at such a match. </i></p><p><i>Peter jumped as the man used the spear to create a big ray of light, or he thought it was just light. As he saw a car get flipped from the magic of the spear, he realized it definitely wasn&rsquo;t light. </i></p><p><i>There was a crowd of people around this man, running, screaming, they were all terrified. Hell, Peter wasn&rsquo;t there and he was sweating like he&rsquo;d just fled the scene. Among those people, Peter was able to spot a familiar tan jacket, but he ignored it, because there could be other people wearing the same jacket. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly, the unnamed man was trapping the group inside of multiple versions of himself. &ldquo;Kneel before me,&rdquo; the man said. He teleported away from the area, leaving a clone. Then, he was in front of the crowd, angry, ready to kill them all. &ldquo;I said KNEEL!&rdquo; Peter almost felt compelled to get on his knee, but his childish fear stopped him. </i></p><p><i>Peter didn&rsquo;t listen to the monologue the man gave. He was more worried about May, who was still holding the phone to her ear, but silently. She was shaking, even crying. After Peter had heard the man finish speaking, May held her hand to her mouth. She was still staring at the TV. &ldquo;Ben! Ben! Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; She suddenly shouted. Peter looked at the TV again. Ben was there.</i></p><p><i>Ben, his uncle that he loved dearly, was standing in the sea of the kneeling people who were too scared to say anything. The man causing the chaos even looked shocked, almost impressed. They stared at each other, different goals in their eyes. It was a battle that we all knew who would lose. Ben gave a monologue of his own, one that made Peter walk closer to the TV, observe it more. He was proud of his uncle, that was until the light of dangerous man&rsquo;s spear began to form again.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ben?&rdquo; Peter questioned to the news being broadcasted, &ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you move?&rdquo; Now, Peter was crying. </i></p><p><i>The light blasted from the spear, hitting Ben dead on. Peter could&rsquo;ve sworn he saw red mixed with the blue light.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ben&hellip;&rdquo; Peter whispered. &ldquo;Ben!&rdquo; He said again, but louder. May then pulled Peter into a hug. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ben?!&rdquo; He screamed through the sobs. </i></p><p><i>Ben had promised that one of Peter&rsquo;s idols would&rsquo;ve saved them, but he lied. Captain America landed seconds after Ben&rsquo;s obliteration, and because of that, Ben didn&rsquo;t come home that night. He&rsquo;d never come home. </i></p><p><i>Peter suddenly preferred Iron Man over Captain America. He tried to think about the man in metal armor as he mourned for his uncle, but that couldn&rsquo;t keep him from thinking about the man&rsquo;s last moments alive. </i></p><p><i>That day definitely wasn&rsquo;t a normal day.</i></p><p>*****</p><p>Peter hadn&rsquo;t realized he&rsquo;d recalled his memories aloud until he heard Tony apologizing frantically and felt the way the older man shook as he held Peter. &ldquo;Gosh, if I had known&hellip; damn&hellip;&rdquo; Tony said. Peter could hear the panic in his mentor&rsquo;s voice, which only made him feel worse than he already had. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Mr. Stark. It just&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t make me feel too good, makes me feel dusty,&rdquo; Peter said dryly. </p><p>&ldquo;I know how it feels, kid. I&rsquo;ll just set aside the blueprints, so nobody has to worry about&hellip; that day happening again,&rdquo; Tony said. </p><p>Peter looked up at Tony, who had a painful attempt of a smile plastered on his face and nodded as if he were five again. They released each other from their comforting hugs, so Tony could organize his pile of projects. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go wash off,&rdquo; Peter muttered; before Tony could reply, Peter was already gone. </p><p>He stared himself in the mirror as he washed the salty tear stains from his cheeks, which were still warm from embarrassment. His hand glided down to his cracked lips, suffering from the dehydration of crying. Both his cheeks and lips matched the rest of his skin, red, irritated and suffering from his depressing trip down memory lane. Peter figured he would possibly break out in some places later, so he cleaned his skin the best he could and rejoined Stark. </p><p>As he walked alone, he thought of several things to himself. Would Tony force Thor to find another place for Loki to stay? Would he just keep Loki as far away from Peter as possible? Every possibility stayed in his mind, even the ones that involved the worst possible outcome for everybody around them. </p><p>He walked into the lab and was immediately greeted by Bruce, who arrived while Peter was cleaning himself. Normally, Peter was taken aback whenever he saw Bruce, but today he was too tired to. All he did was greet Bruce back.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid!&rdquo; Peter heard from the opposite side of the lab. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re adding extra legs to your iron suit. Let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s a little gift from the tooth fairy.&rdquo; </p><p>A small grin formed on Peter&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Okay, Mr. Stark!&rdquo; </p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t need to worry about his fears or Loki at the moment, all he needed to do was make sure his only fatherly figure didn&rsquo;t stab himself with a metal spider leg. </p><p><a href=\"http://samskablamsarts.tumblr.com/post/177918903513/uncle-ben-died-in-the-battle-of-new-york-pass-it\">PART 1</a> | PART 3</p><p>Tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQEILDjFjHcSS_OE5dAH3A\">@t-rexhighfives</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/matyIMD9c9Q41DoajyinJmw\">@evil-9enguin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVlof0gNFCZ-oUjmcuYbJfg\">@loki-redeemed-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYu5RwZwilUukdzIGHVs0pA\">@whimsicalbarnes</a> </p></p>",
