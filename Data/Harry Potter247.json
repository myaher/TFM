(more backstory than actual wolfstar in here!)</p><ul><li>Welcome to Hogwarts Academy, where things aren\u2019t currently going great for the Science department.\u00a0</li><li>Minerva McGonagall runs maths. Fiercely protective of her further maths girls numbers, Minerva would personally fight anyone who so much thought of being a sexist prick in the science department. What this usually meant was she ended up fighting Severus, often.</li>\n<li>She and Rolanda Hooch are the lesbian mums of the entire faculty. </li><li>Sirius Black, twenty-something alumnus of the Academy, teaches Art, because they\u2019re a walking talking queer stereotype and boldly embrace it, paint-stained clothes and all.</li>\n<li>Sprout and Grubbly-Plank teach biology. Snape teaches Chemistry. Flitwick single-handedly runs the entire Physics department, and has progressively gotten more and more frantic and upset after a stream of horrible new physics teachers, none of whom lasted more than a year.</li>\n<li>(There was Mr. Quirrel, who was white but wore a turban because he felt it \u2018reflected his spiritual being\u2019, and none of the Muslim students liked him. After a nasty incident at the end of term involving a can of air-freshener, a bunsen burner, and a distinct lack of safety goggles, he had to\u2026 be removed for his own health, shall we say.)</li>\n<li>(Then there was Mr. Lockhart, or, as Grubbly-Plank referred to him, \u2018misogynistic idiot\u2019; he\u2019d written a pseudo-pop-science book once and thought he was a bit of a celebrity, he was convinced all the women on staff wanted to sleep with him, was fond of inappropriately turning on the charm on his students, and\u2026 didn\u2019t seem to know any science, at all. After the third student showed up to Sprout\u2019s office, trying to get out words about him being not entirely comfortable to be around in classes, she declared war on Lockhart, discovered he\u2019d plagiarised an impressive amount of information, and marched into Dumbledore\u2019s office demanding he be fired: \u2018Dumbledore, my ten year old niece could teach physics better than he does, and on top of that, my niece isn\u2019t creepy.\u2019 He didn\u2019t even last a full year.)</li>\n<li>(The department is still reeling from Mr. Moody, who used to teach in the 70s, had a career change, and went off to fight in Iraq. He came back a war vet, and after a few years off decided he wanted to come back to teaching, but in addition to still acting like education hadn\u2019t changed one bit, his methods were also rather\u2026 unconventional. He seemed to think he was preparing soldiers, barked orders at teenagers, and demanded \u2018CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\u2019 if they forgot the half in \u2018half mv squared\u2019.

After a nasty incident at the end of term involving a can of air-freshener, a bunsen burner, and a distinct lack of safety goggles, he had to&hellip; be removed for his own health, shall we say.)</li>\n<li>(Then there was Mr. Lockhart, or, as Grubbly-Plank referred to him, &lsquo;misogynistic idiot&rsquo;; he&rsquo;d written a pseudo-pop-science book once and thought he was a bit of a celebrity, he was convinced all the women on staff wanted to sleep with him, was fond of inappropriately turning on the charm on his students, and&hellip; didn&rsquo;t seem to know any science, at all. After the third student showed up to Sprout&rsquo;s office, trying to get out words about him being not entirely comfortable to be around in classes, she declared war on Lockhart, discovered he&rsquo;d plagiarised an impressive amount of information, and marched into Dumbledore&rsquo;s office demanding he be fired: &lsquo;Dumbledore, my ten year old niece could teach physics better than he does, and on top of that, my niece isn&rsquo;t creepy.&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t even last a full year.)</li>\n<li>(The department is still reeling from Mr. Moody, who used to teach in the 70s, had a career change, and went off to fight in Iraq. He came back a war vet, and after a few years off decided he wanted to come back to teaching, but in addition to still acting like education hadn&rsquo;t changed one bit, his methods were also rather&hellip; unconventional. He seemed to think he was preparing soldiers, barked orders at teenagers, and demanded &lsquo;CONSTANT VIGILANCE!&rsquo; if they forgot the half in &lsquo;half mv squared&rsquo;. After an AS lesson about two months in that Flitwick walked in on where he was teaching projectile motion through a&hellip; very vivid question about bombing Iraqi planes, Flitwick decided he&rsquo;d had enough, and the science department pitched in to patch up and teach physics between themselves for the rest of the year.)</li>\n<li>Which brings us to now, where Flitwick and the entire science department, exhausted, have put out another vacancy.</li>\n<li>Between themselves, they&rsquo;re sort of resigned to not having a decent physics teacher yet again, as Minerva told Rolanda one night, &ldquo;I told Filius, better no teacher than a shit teacher, he and I will teach physics single-handedly if we must&rdquo;, and Rolanda just sighed and shook her head at her wife. </li>\n<li>Enter Remus. </li>\n<li>He&rsquo;s young, finished his undergrad and went straight into ITT, and this is his NQT year. A physicist trained in physics teaching is a rarity, which worked in his favour, because he needed to <i>move</i>, and quick. (His teacher training year was rough&mdash;in between coming out to his family, he got on the bad side of a group called the Greybacks, and his year ended with a violent encounter with their lead, Fenrir, a guy a few years ahead of Remus at school, leaving him with some impressive scars, a massive uptick in anxiety, and a need to get the <i>fuck</i> away from Reading.) One day his alert-me-about-teacher-postings email dinged, and&hellip; Scotland. Perfect. Very hard to get further north than Scotland, unless you want to teach in the middle of the North Sea. </li>\n<li>It&rsquo;s an impressive posting, on paper. A private boarding school, based in a freaking Scottish castle, in, essentially, the middle of nowhere. It&rsquo;s got its own goddamn <i>train</i>, for crying out loud. The posting says, <i>Teachers are welcome to arrange their own accommodation in the nearby village of Hogsmeade, but subsidised accommodation in Hogwarts castle can also be provided. Please indicate which option you are interested in when you apply. </i>Remus doesn&rsquo;t expect to get in, not with essentially no experience, but there&rsquo;s a little note at the bottom of the vacancy that says, <i>Teachers in their NQT year are also encouraged to apply</i>. </li>\n<li>Truth is, after the spate of bad teachers, Dumbledore&rsquo;s, shall we say, eccentric management techniques, and the general isolation of Hogwarts, no actually experienced decent teacher really wants to go there. It&rsquo;s acquired a bit of its own reputation. The only people who apply are awful (see above), and the occasional young teacher. </li>\n<li>(Flitwick, after the disastrous past few years, has resolved to give preference to &lsquo;fresh slates&rsquo;&mdash;teachers with next to no experience, who have yet to be corrupted by misplaced fame, or weird culturally appropriative spiritualist ideas, or the military, or any of that. When he sits down to look at the applications, a little bright-blue post-it note on his desk reads: <b>1. No celebrities! 2. Nobody violent!</b> And in Grubbly-Plank&rsquo;s handwriting, <b>NO </b><b>misogynistic idiots!!! (Yes I know it&rsquo;s phys, Filius, but there have to be some)</b>)</li>\n<li>Remus instantly makes the interview stage. Not too keen on making someone all the way south travel to Scotland, and slightly fond of the idea of a day out themselves, Flitwick and McGonagall (mostly there for intimidation, and to ensure the third bullet point is fulfilled) take a trip down to London, and meet Remus in a coffee shop. </li>\n<li>(Yes, it&rsquo;s unorthodox, but there is <i>some</i> benefit to being privately run; also, school&rsquo;s let out and they can&rsquo;t have an in-class test anyway, and they&rsquo;re desperate.)</li>\n<li>(There were only two other applicants: one was a sixty-something year old woman who talked a <i>little</i> too much in her application about &lsquo;enhancing traditional values&rsquo; for Minerva&rsquo;s comfort, and the other was a geographer. The competition isn&rsquo;t too stiff, honestly.)</li>\n<li>Flitwick takes to Remus quickly&mdash;Minerva raises her eyebrows, slightly concerned, at the scars down the side of his too-thin face, but he&rsquo;s quiet and unassuming in a way that&rsquo;s a relief after the double-horror of trying to deal with Moody and Lockhart&rsquo;s, ah, expansive personalities. Also, he has a physics degree, so he can&rsquo;t be a <i>complete</i> idiot&hellip; right? (Right. Flitwick quizzes him on misconceptions about gravity, and, after a moment, asks, &ldquo;How would you go about introducing projectile motion?&rdquo; Remus blinks, smiles, picks up a sugar packet, and says, &ldquo;Catch.&rdquo; Flitwick does, relieved, and adds, just for good measure, &ldquo;Just so you know, we disapprove of using, ah, more violent metaphors or examples when teaching.&rdquo; Remus frowns, perplexed, but just says, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;)</li>\n<li>On the train back to Hogwarts, Flitwick sits cross-legged on a seat, valiantly attempting to eat a wrap that&rsquo;s fallen apart in the bag, and Minerva sips at a takeaway cup of Earl Grey and declares, &ldquo;Well, I like him.&rdquo; Flitwick looks up from his wrap and smiles. &ldquo;Yes, I rather think I do too.&rdquo; </li>\n<li>Which is how, completely shocked, Remus J. Lupin lands himself a teaching position &ndash; just on a year contract, but <i>oh, </i> it feels brilliant, he&rsquo;s going to be <i>teaching</i> &ndash; &nbsp;and how, one week before the students arrive, he gets off the Hogwarts Express with a suitcase and a battered briefcase with <i>R J Lupin</i> inscribed on it, held together with a large quantity of neatly-knotted string, and a large man shakes his hand, and says, &ldquo;Welcome t&rsquo; Hogwarts, Mr. Lupin. I&rsquo;m Rubeus Hagrid.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul></p>",

War is relentless and intolerable, forcing brothers to fight brothers in a gory mess that threatens the very livelihood of community; and not just those possessing the gift of magic are in danger. While some <b><i>dance</i></b> in puddles of plasma, others cower in dark corners waiting for it all to end. No matter which side you choose, loss is inevitable while<b> Lord Voldemort </b>fights for control. Sometimes, it takes more than protocol to put an end to unnecessary bloodshed. It is in the <b><i>rebels</i></b> that we find hope and torn morals giving just about everyone a sense of unrest. They always did say fighting fire with fire never worked; but maybe a small spark will help bring an end to the <b>rivalry</b>.\n\n</small><br /></p></blockquote><h2><b><sub>WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?</sub></b></h2><blockquote><p><small>We are a group of writers dedicated to plot and character development.
