        "body": "<p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16624244\">AO3</a></b></p><p><br/></p><p>If Peter could\u2019ve stopped it,\nhe would\u2019ve. Honest to fucking God, Mary, Jesus and the Holy Spirit \u2013 he <i>would\u2019ve.</i></p><p>But Peter Parker had no\ncontrol in this situation. He was chained with his arms above his head,\nvibranium cuffs around his wrists, and he was just\u2026 watching. An absent\nparticipant. Unwilling, sure, but there on the side lines; not taking part but\nnot able to stop it.</p><p>He choked up a sob as the men\nin masks jolted Tony awake. They\u2019d stopped his heart by accident \u2013 at least,\nPeter thought it was accidental. The way one bitched to the other; slapping him\naround the head and swearing in a language Peter didn\u2019t understand, made him\nthink it wasn\u2019t on purpose. No, see, they still wanted something and Tony knew\nhow to get it.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t know what it was\nthough. He\u2019d woken up to Tony\u2019s screaming. He\u2019d woken up long after Tony had\nbargained Peter down from the very same table Tony was being resuscitated on.</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re\nlucky,\u201d </i>one of the men had\ntold Peter in broken English. <i>\u201cHe swore\nhe\u2019d never give us a damn thing if even one of your hairs was out of place.\u201d</i></p><!-- more --><p>Peter wanted to vomit and he\nwanted to cry; he wanted to scream but that role was saved for Tony, who was\nusing it liberally as his heart was jolted into working again. The men stepped\nback, letting him take a breath before they went looking for their next toy to\nplay with.</p><p>They\u2019d already had a lot of\nfun with waterboarding, and there were enough bloody crosshatches across Tony\u2019s\nchest to tell Peter they\u2019d played with knives. Tony was quivering like\nelectricity was still coursing through him \u2013 that was the only one Peter had\nwitnessed. The way his body had tensed, back arched in agony, a silent scream\ntorn from his mouth.</p><p>When Tony flung his head to\nthe side suddenly, eyes wide and searching for Peter, his body relaxed at the\nsight of him, unharmed by the wall. His mouth seemed to be forming words that\nPeter couldn\u2019t make out and he whimpered, wanting to hear Tony\u2019s voice, wanting\nto be able to reply, himself-</p><p>But Peter had no words left\nin him. He had nothing other than strangled screams and choked out sobs. Words\nescaped him when he couldn\u2019t pull the handcuffs free; when he realised that he\nwas going to be here for the long haul \u2013 until someone fucking found them.</p><p>Tony jerked suddenly when a\ndrill started up across the room and Peter darted his eyes over, watching the\nmen return to the table, their masks covering the gruesome smiles they must\u2019ve\nbeen wearing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve died and come back,\u201d\none of the men said. \u201cTell us who Spiderman is or we\u2019ll make sure you never\nwalk again.\u201d</p><p>If Peter could cough up\nblood, he would\u2019ve. He would\u2019ve coughed up his insides that were crawling their\nway up his throat. He would\u2019ve spat and choked and drowned on blood until his\nlungs were hanging from a cord from his mouth, his heart between his teeth.\nThey were here for him.</p><p>Tony wheezed out a reply.\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>The drill started up in\nearnest, and Tony yelled when it made contact with the skin of his knee. Blood\nsplattered and Peter slammed his eyes shut. Tony deserved for Peter to at least\nwatch the pain he was enduring on his behalf, but Peter didn\u2019t have it in him.\nHe couldn\u2019t do it. He\u2019d live the rest of his life with the sounds; he didn\u2019t\nneed the visuals too.</p><p>Yet, against his will, his\neyes opened; hands on his face, directing him to the gore spread out in front\nof him. Tony had become almost still, barely breathing as he worked through the\npain; one gasping breath after another, punctuated by the roaring of the drill.\nAs Peter watched, the blood froze in thin air, then rained upwards, flying\nstraight to the ceiling and pooling there as if gravity had flipped.</p><p>The scene was still, the\nsound cut off suddenly. Peter, like the man holding his face, like the man with\nthe drill and Tony on the table, was paralysed; unmoving, caught in a moment of\npain and agony and desperation.</p><p>Peter gasped, suddenly,\nwaking up.</p><p>The dingy room with his arms\nchained above his head vanished with the intake of breath, his bedroom coming\ninto sudden focus; the bunk bed above his, the blue walls darkened by night,\nthe faint light coming from the window. He was still, his muscles tense from\nthe dream \u2013 the nightmare, the memory \u2013 and he had to let his heart slow down\nbefore he could pull himself up, sitting on the side of his bed.</p><p>The carpet floor was too\ncold, somehow, on his feet. Blood splattered behind his eyelids.</p><p>Peter took a long breath,\nhand pressed firmly against his chest, right above his heart that was no longer\nsuffocating him by sitting in his mouth.</p><p>He felt the beating, the\nthumping, one after another and let himself calm down.</p><p>Outside his window, Queens\nplodded through the night. A car went past, a conversation happened across the\nroad. Music faintly reached his ears from an all-night diner a few blocks away.</p><p>The world was still turning,\neven when everyone was frozen in the chamber; in the room with vibranium hand\ncuffs for him and Tony, with a work table of assorted weapons and the ugly,\nyellow lighting that made everything seem a little green.</p><p>It had been over a month\nsince that day; since he was taken from the street as he and Tony walked back\nto the car after a lunch together. Since men who\u2019d been sent by a crime boss\nPeter had kicked the ass of had needed Spiderman\u2019s identity. Since War Machine\nhad broken through the ceiling, guns blazing, turning the room into even more\nof a blood bath than it had initially been.</p><p>Peter took one shuddering\nbreath after another before finally reaching out for his phone. He yanked it\noff the bedside table, letting the charging cord fall to the ground. After\nwincing at the light, he read the time: 4:14AM, and silently hoped that Tony\nwas still awake.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t, but he picked up\nanyway.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony asked, his\nvoice muffled by a pillow. Peter felt bad for all of two seconds for waking him\n\u2013 Tony got little sleep as it was \u2013 but Tony had insisted that Peter call him\nwhenever he needed him. And Peter needed him right then. \u201cAre you out on\npatrol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter whispered. May\u2019s\nresting heartbeat thumped gently through the connecting wall. \u201cI just. I\nwatched you die.\u201d</p><p>Tony sounded like he was\nblowing out a breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t die, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then it restarted. We\u2019re\nnot calling it death if it didn\u2019t take.\u201d There was a beat of silence where\nPeter felt how tightly his phone was pressed against his face, how hard his\nhand was against his chest, how desperately he needed to hear Tony breathing. \u201cI\u2019m\nokay, Peter.\u201d It was the same way every other night when the nightmares visited\nhim; thrusting him back into memories he\u2019d rather bury. \u201cWe\u2019re okay.

And maybe a few more surgeries \u2013\nbut <i>Peter.</i> I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, shifting and\nflopping back onto his pillow. He stared at the bed above. He couldn\u2019t have Ned\nsleep over when he didn\u2019t know if he was going to wake up screaming or paralysed\nor crying from a day his subconscious wouldn\u2019t let him forget. \u201cCan I come over\ntomorrow? Or, uh, today?\u201d</p><p>Tony hummed positive. He knew\nthat Peter needed to see him in person, walking around, to breathe properly\nagain. \u201cSure thing. Pep\u2019s planned a yoga thing for us in the morning \u2013 says it\nbalances her core or something \u2013 so come round after lunch, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, Pete. We\u2019re\ngonna get through this, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna live to see a\nhundred tomorrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s going to be\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d</p><p>There was quiet, the two of\nthem having said the same thing so many times before. Peter loosened the hold\nover his heart, closing his eyes. There was shuffling on the phone, the sound\nof a quiet hum, and then a whispered voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d Pepper said,\nher voice in Peter\u2019s ear. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied after a\nbeat. \u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the smile in\nher voice. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I think Tony\u2019s already fallen asleep again.\u201d Peter\nhuffed out a laugh. \u201cTry and get some sleep. We both love you a lot, okay? If\nyou ever need us-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Thanks,\nPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, Peter.\u201d</p><p>When the call finally cut\noff, Peter slipped it back onto the bedside table and blew out a long breath.\nHe then curled up on his side and, feeling better than he had when he woke up,\nfell into a dreamless sleep.<br/></p>",

After\nwincing at the light, he read the time: 4:14AM, and silently hoped that Tony\nwas still awake.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t, but he picked up\nanyway.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony asked, his\nvoice muffled by a pillow. Peter felt bad for all of two seconds for waking him\n\u2013 Tony got little sleep as it was \u2013 but Tony had insisted that Peter call him\nwhenever he needed him. And Peter needed him right then. \u201cAre you out on\npatrol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter whispered. May\u2019s\nresting heartbeat thumped gently through the connecting wall. \u201cI just. I\nwatched you die.\u201d</p><p>Tony sounded like he was\nblowing out a breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t die, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then it restarted. We\u2019re\nnot calling it death if it didn\u2019t take.\u201d There was a beat of silence where\nPeter felt how tightly his phone was pressed against his face, how hard his\nhand was against his chest, how desperately he needed to hear Tony breathing. \u201cI\u2019m\nokay, Peter.\u201d It was the same way every other night when the nightmares visited\nhim; thrusting him back into memories he\u2019d rather bury. \u201cWe\u2019re okay. We made it\nout, we\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan too,\u201d Tony shot back,\nequally quiet. \u201cI just need a brace, is all. And maybe a few more surgeries \u2013\nbut <i>Peter.</i> I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, shifting and\nflopping back onto his pillow. He stared at the bed above. He couldn\u2019t have Ned\nsleep over when he didn\u2019t know if he was going to wake up screaming or paralysed\nor crying from a day his subconscious wouldn\u2019t let him forget. \u201cCan I come over\ntomorrow? Or, uh, today?\u201d</p><p>Tony hummed positive. He knew\nthat Peter needed to see him in person, walking around, to breathe properly\nagain. \u201cSure thing. Pep\u2019s planned a yoga thing for us in the morning \u2013 says it\nbalances her core or something \u2013 so come round after lunch, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, Pete. We\u2019re\ngonna get through this, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna live to see a\nhundred tomorrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s going to be\nbetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d</p><p>There was quiet, the two of\nthem having said the same thing so many times before. Peter loosened the hold\nover his heart, closing his eyes. There was shuffling on the phone, the sound\nof a quiet hum, and then a whispered voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d Pepper said,\nher voice in Peter\u2019s ear. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied after a\nbeat. \u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the smile in\nher voice. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I think Tony\u2019s already fallen asleep again.\u201d Peter\nhuffed out a laugh. \u201cTry and get some sleep. We both love you a lot, okay? If\nyou ever need us-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Thanks,\nPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, Peter.\u201d</p><p>When the call finally cut\noff, Peter slipped it back onto the bedside table and blew out a long breath.\nHe then curled up on his side and, feeling better than he had when he woke up,\nfell into a dreamless sleep.<br></p>",
                "content": "<p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16624244\">AO3</a></b></p><p><br /></p><p>If Peter could&rsquo;ve stopped it,\nhe would&rsquo;ve. Honest to fucking God, Mary, Jesus and the Holy Spirit &ndash; he <i>would&rsquo;ve.</i></p><p>But Peter Parker had no\ncontrol in this situation. He was chained with his arms above his head,\nvibranium cuffs around his wrists, and he was just&hellip; watching. An absent\nparticipant. Unwilling, sure, but there on the side lines; not taking part but\nnot able to stop it.</p><p>He choked up a sob as the men\nin masks jolted Tony awake. They&rsquo;d stopped his heart by accident &ndash; at least,\nPeter thought it was accidental. The way one bitched to the other; slapping him\naround the head and swearing in a language Peter didn&rsquo;t understand, made him\nthink it wasn&rsquo;t on purpose. No, see, they still wanted something and Tony knew\nhow to get it.</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t know what it was\nthough. He&rsquo;d woken up to Tony&rsquo;s screaming. He&rsquo;d woken up long after Tony had\nbargained Peter down from the very same table Tony was being resuscitated on.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nlucky,&rdquo; </i>one of the men had\ntold Peter in broken English. <i>&ldquo;He swore\nhe&rsquo;d never give us a damn thing if even one of your hairs was out of place.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Peter wanted to vomit and he\nwanted to cry; he wanted to scream but that role was saved for Tony, who was\nusing it liberally as his heart was jolted into working again. The men stepped\nback, letting him take a breath before they went looking for their next toy to\nplay with.</p><p>They&rsquo;d already had a lot of\nfun with waterboarding, and there were enough bloody crosshatches across Tony&rsquo;s\nchest to tell Peter they&rsquo;d played with knives. Tony was quivering like\nelectricity was still coursing through him &ndash; that was the only one Peter had\nwitnessed. The way his body had tensed, back arched in agony, a silent scream\ntorn from his mouth.</p><p>When Tony flung his head to\nthe side suddenly, eyes wide and searching for Peter, his body relaxed at the\nsight of him, unharmed by the wall. His mouth seemed to be forming words that\nPeter couldn&rsquo;t make out and he whimpered, wanting to hear Tony&rsquo;s voice, wanting\nto be able to reply, himself-</p><p>But Peter had no words left\nin him. He had nothing other than strangled screams and choked out sobs. Words\nescaped him when he couldn&rsquo;t pull the handcuffs free; when he realised that he\nwas going to be here for the long haul &ndash; until someone fucking found them.</p><p>Tony jerked suddenly when a\ndrill started up across the room and Peter darted his eyes over, watching the\nmen return to the table, their masks covering the gruesome smiles they must&rsquo;ve\nbeen wearing.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve died and come back,&rdquo;\none of the men said. &ldquo;Tell us who Spiderman is or we&rsquo;ll make sure you never\nwalk again.&rdquo;</p><p>If Peter could cough up\nblood, he would&rsquo;ve. He would&rsquo;ve coughed up his insides that were crawling their\nway up his throat. He would&rsquo;ve spat and choked and drowned on blood until his\nlungs were hanging from a cord from his mouth, his heart between his teeth.\nThey were here for him.</p><p>Tony wheezed out a reply.\n&ldquo;Fuck you.&rdquo;</p><p>The drill started up in\nearnest, and Tony yelled when it made contact with the skin of his knee. Blood\nsplattered and Peter slammed his eyes shut. Tony deserved for Peter to at least\nwatch the pain he was enduring on his behalf, but Peter didn&rsquo;t have it in him.\nHe couldn&rsquo;t do it. He&rsquo;d live the rest of his life with the sounds; he didn&rsquo;t\nneed the visuals too.</p><p>Yet, against his will, his\neyes opened; hands on his face, directing him to the gore spread out in front\nof him. Tony had become almost still, barely breathing as he worked through the\npain; one gasping breath after another, punctuated by the roaring of the drill.\nAs Peter watched, the blood froze in thin air, then rained upwards, flying\nstraight to the ceiling and pooling there as if gravity had flipped.</p><p>The scene was still, the\nsound cut off suddenly. Peter, like the man holding his face, like the man with\nthe drill and Tony on the table, was paralysed; unmoving, caught in a moment of\npain and agony and desperation.</p><p>Peter gasped, suddenly,\nwaking up.</p><p>The dingy room with his arms\nchained above his head vanished with the intake of breath, his bedroom coming\ninto sudden focus; the bunk bed above his, the blue walls darkened by night,\nthe faint light coming from the window. He was still, his muscles tense from\nthe dream &ndash; the nightmare, the memory &ndash; and he had to let his heart slow down\nbefore he could pull himself up, sitting on the side of his bed.</p><p>The carpet floor was too\ncold, somehow, on his feet. Blood splattered behind his eyelids.</p><p>Peter took a long breath,\nhand pressed firmly against his chest, right above his heart that was no longer\nsuffocating him by sitting in his mouth.</p><p>He felt the beating, the\nthumping, one after another and let himself calm down.</p><p>Outside his window, Queens\nplodded through the night. A car went past, a conversation happened across the\nroad. Music faintly reached his ears from an all-night diner a few blocks away.</p><p>The world was still turning,\neven when everyone was frozen in the chamber; in the room with vibranium hand\ncuffs for him and Tony, with a work table of assorted weapons and the ugly,\nyellow lighting that made everything seem a little green.</p><p>It had been over a month\nsince that day; since he was taken from the street as he and Tony walked back\nto the car after a lunch together. Since men who&rsquo;d been sent by a crime boss\nPeter had kicked the ass of had needed Spiderman&rsquo;s identity. Since War Machine\nhad broken through the ceiling, guns blazing, turning the room into even more\nof a blood bath than it had initially been.</p><p>Peter took one shuddering\nbreath after another before finally reaching out for his phone. He yanked it\noff the bedside table, letting the charging cord fall to the ground. After\nwincing at the light, he read the time: 4:14AM, and silently hoped that Tony\nwas still awake.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t, but he picked up\nanyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Tony asked, his\nvoice muffled by a pillow.
