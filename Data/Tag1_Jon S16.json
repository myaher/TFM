He CAN&rsquo;T give her anything in return in the same terms as men or dragons BECAUSE HE DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE THEM. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of one partner being well off and being able to afford the nice things in life while the other can&rsquo;t.

What does he have which can be valuable enough? There&rsquo;s only thing - his metaphorical crown. Dany gets the North back as one of her kingdoms and whatever is left of the Northern army during her own campaign. Which, by the way, is EMPHATICALLY Dany&rsquo;s war. She gets everything material Jon COULD have afforded. </p><p>Now let&rsquo;s get to the immaterial exchange. Dany gives him her heart, her belief and a reason for Jon to truly live again. Jon gives her HIS heart and his unshakeable loyalty. When doesn&rsquo;t he stand up for her, in the open and behind closed doors? He defends her to his lords, to Sansa, to Dany&rsquo;s own advisors and to Arya. If Jon makes Dany believe in the goodness of love again, it&rsquo;s Dany who brings back Jon&rsquo;s faith in doing the right thing. The faith which was obliterated after his murder. He believes in her vision and her capability whole-heartedly. </p><p>Until it all changes.

Dany&rsquo;s genocide didn&rsquo;t happen at all - but Jon totally took everything he could from her, used her love for his own ends and then killed her. It&rsquo;s definitely not a problem that Dany&rsquo;s first thought on hearing about his heritage was how it affects HER power and not how lost Jon would be. But it&rsquo;s definitely Jon&rsquo;s betrayal to Dany for letting HIS truth be known to HIS family. </p><p>Either nothing in Episodes 4 to 6 happened - thus Dany didn&rsquo;t suddenly become a paranoid power hungry female villain stereotype and Jon did NOT kill her. </p><p>- She realised that being insecure of his parentage to the extent of asking JON to hide the truth for fear of her throne was beneath her. Jon realised that all he needed to do was tell her that he his entire life was a lie and he needs time to be able to think clearly again, but he still feels exactly the same about her. She doesn&rsquo;t suddenly turn blind up in the air and 'kind of forget about the Iron Fleet&rsquo;. She spots the ships and does what she&rsquo;s the best at and Missandei doesn&rsquo;t get captured and killed. Jon spectacularly loses it on the beach when Varys suggests supplanting her and almost breaks his neck. They BOTH realise that the last Targaryens need to stick together. </p><p>Or - everything in those episodes DID happen. She DID annihilate the poorest sections of KL for no reason, showed no remorse, relished in the destruction and flat out told Jon that his remaining family wouldn&rsquo;t live. Jon did have to face the fact that her bloodlust affected everyone around him to the extent that surrendering soldiers were treated as charging ones and that his own men would become the kind of vicious beasts who would destroy and rape and pillage during a conquest. He did have to walk through the streets with ash floating down like snow and realise that she killed people whose only fault was to try and make a home in KL.

He did have to walk through the streets with ash floating down like snow and realise that she killed people whose only fault was to try and make a home in KL.

                "content": "<p><h1>&lsquo;Dany gave Jon everything and he gave her nothing!&rsquo; - WRONG. </h1><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8170618b4a7eaef5700921bf7fbd94e7/tumblr_pt03nwxNys1wvieoe_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Pictured above are two equals, with the same outlook on the world and the same belief system. Both young, both having survived traumatic events and both isolated from the groups around them. </p><p>But they&rsquo;re not equal when it comes to wealth. He&rsquo;s been crowned King of an impoverished kingdom facing down certain doom. She&rsquo;s pretty much the ASOIAF military equivalent of a self-made billionaire tycoon. So when Jon asks for her aid against a war which is as much her war as it&rsquo;s his, even if there&rsquo;s no conceivable way she&rsquo;s going to believe it, what can he give her in return? What&rsquo;s he got, in terms of material wealth, which she doesn&rsquo;t already have in abundance? </p><p>The answer to that is nothing. He CAN&rsquo;T give her anything in return in the same terms as men or dragons BECAUSE HE DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE THEM. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of one partner being well off and being able to afford the nice things in life while the other can&rsquo;t. And all the friends of the well-off partner judging the other for not being able to live up to the same standards of living. </p><p>But then again it&rsquo;s true, Dany lost Viserion and most of the Dothraki (or half, or whatever proportion was in the script at that point of time). And she did lose them in the North. But ah, saying that she lost her men and her dragons to JON&rsquo;S war is insane. Just because those two jackasses couldn&rsquo;t bother spending more than an episode to culminate a story which literally began the series doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not the apocalyptic threat it&rsquo;s always meant to be. It&rsquo;s not Jon&rsquo;s war or the North&rsquo;s war. It war for all who live - the North just happened to be first in line. And as such, Dany&rsquo;s forces have the most dead simply because they&rsquo;re the most numerous. It was always going to be the case. </p><p>So getting back to the transactional part of their alliance - what can Jon trade in return for her material goods? What does he have which can be valuable enough? There&rsquo;s only thing - his metaphorical crown. Dany gets the North back as one of her kingdoms and whatever is left of the Northern army during her own campaign. Which, by the way, is EMPHATICALLY Dany&rsquo;s war. She gets everything material Jon COULD have afforded. </p><p>Now let&rsquo;s get to the immaterial exchange. Dany gives him her heart, her belief and a reason for Jon to truly live again. Jon gives her HIS heart and his unshakeable loyalty. When doesn&rsquo;t he stand up for her, in the open and behind closed doors? He defends her to his lords, to Sansa, to Dany&rsquo;s own advisors and to Arya. If Jon makes Dany believe in the goodness of love again, it&rsquo;s Dany who brings back Jon&rsquo;s faith in doing the right thing. The faith which was obliterated after his murder. He believes in her vision and her capability whole-heartedly. </p><p>Until it all changes. And FUCK this change.</p><p>The saddest part of this season is having the Jon and Dany fans turn against each other due to knee-jerk emotional reactions and major cognitive dissonance. Dany&rsquo;s genocide didn&rsquo;t happen at all - but Jon totally took everything he could from her, used her love for his own ends and then killed her. It&rsquo;s definitely not a problem that Dany&rsquo;s first thought on hearing about his heritage was how it affects HER power and not how lost Jon would be. But it&rsquo;s definitely Jon&rsquo;s betrayal to Dany for letting HIS truth be known to HIS family. </p><p>Either nothing in Episodes 4 to 6 happened - thus Dany didn&rsquo;t suddenly become a paranoid power hungry female villain stereotype and Jon did NOT kill her. </p><p>- She realised that being insecure of his parentage to the extent of asking JON to hide the truth for fear of her throne was beneath her.

For too long she had had to miss his touch and the heat of his body keeping her warm. Now she was finally here, staying here in the cold with all those eyes watching them and all those clothes on seemed like a waste of what little time they had together. </p><p>But she was a Queen now and all those people staring at them were her people.

Her warm breath was visible in the cold winter air. \u201cBut Bran told me it was too early, too soon.\u201d She let her head rest on his broad shoulder. She doubted if he was still fighting or practicing with his sword and yet she couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else she\u2019d feel this safe and at home with. \u201cI\u2019m glad he gave me an excuse to come here and visit you, though\u2026\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Jon\u2019s hand went through her hair and he twirled a loose strand around the tip of his finger. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m glad he made you do that.\u201d He whispered and his lips were almost touching her ear. \u201cBecause now I\u2019ve got to let you go again. And I don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Sansa closed her eyes. She knew that Jon was right. In a few weeks she would have to get on her horse again and that horse would carry her back to Winterfell. And neither of them knew when they would see each other again. But she didn\u2019t want to ruin this moment of happiness, of finally being with him again and being able to talk to him again without having to wait days for an answer. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk about that yet. We have a few more weeks before I have to leave again, maybe by then you will be tired of me and get headaches because I\u2019m talking too much.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled and his lips kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll never grow tired of you.\u201d He pressed the palms of his hands to her glowing cheeks before he kissed her slightly parted lips again. \u201cAnd you can talk as much as you like. I missed hearing your ramblings and I missed your voice of reason.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up, but the magical moment was disturbed when one of her guards cleared his throat. </p><p>\u201cMy apologies, your majesties.\u201d His voice trembled slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark soon. We need to unsaddle the horses and get them comfortable for the night.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked at Jon, but Jon kept silent. She was the Queen now, she was the ruler of the North now and just like everyone else Jon now waited for her commands. \u201cJon\u2026\u201d She remembered that she had promised to ask him how her men should address him. \u201cCould you send a few men to help the Northerners to settle?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course, my Queen.\u201d Jon nodded and stepped back from her to talk to a few of his friends, who kept a polite distance ever since Sansa had rushed through the gate. He maybe was no longer a King and he maybe didn\u2019t even want to be one anymore, but he still moved and behaved like one. Not like the one who would just order people around to do whatever he wanted them to do. He still was the kind of King people wanted to fight for and fight with. He still was the kind of King people believed in and trusted with their lives.</p><p>A few seconds later his men walked towards the gathered Northern caravan and lead them away to the stables so the horses could finally get some well deserved rest. </p><p>\u201cYou can banish a King from his Kingdom, but he\u2019ll always be a King\u2026\u201d Sansa only realised that she had said the words out loud when Jon let his forehead rest on hers. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a King anymore, Sansa.\u201d Jon spoke softly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need to be one. The North has a Queen, a wonderful Queen.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s intelligent and just. She\u2019s soft and strong. She\u2019s beautiful and brave.\u201d He paused for a moment and his eyes stared straight into hers. \u201cAnd she most of all doesn\u2019t need a King.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do need a King.\u201d Sansa closed her eyes. She was intelligent and just and soft and strong and beautiful and brave. But she was also just a girl who longed to be loved and cared for. \u201cI do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not as your King.\u201d Jon\u2019s nose brushed hers. \u201cEven when Bran says it\u2019s okay for me to come home\u2026\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI still don\u2019t wanna be King again.\u201d His lips touched hers carefully. \u201cI want to be your husband. I want to be the father of your children. I want to help you raise the future Kings and Queens in the North.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t want to be King anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was already designing a beautiful crown for you.\u201d Sansa placed her hands on his shoulders. \u201cOne to match my tiara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be making me a crown. You should make one for you. A real crown for a true Queen, for the rightful ruler of the most beautiful Kingdom of Westeros.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Sansa\u2019s face brightened and then she kissed him once more. \u201cIf only all Kings, Princes and Lords I encountered had been like you. The world would have been a much better place.\u201d</p>",

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

I follow an excellent asoiaf meta blog (ASOIAF University) and a couple years back they reblogged <a href=\"https://justadram.tumblr.com/post/39066350542/marrying-your-cousin\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://justadram.tumblr.com/post/145211506235/marrying-your-cousin\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> meta by Just A Dram about Jon and Sansa and westerosi views on cousin marriage. And though I\u2019d never, ever considered Jon and Sansa as a ship, as soon as I heard the idea it immediately clicked for me: the way Jon and Sansa might interact, the parallels in their arcs, the way that they\u2019ve both grown into what the other wants, the way both of them are romantics who\u2019ve had to face the harsh world.<b><br/></b></p><p>I did what any good fan does and went to AO3 to look through some fic. Unfortunately in that first run I didn\u2019t find any good ones, and so my interest in Jonsa kind of flagged and went dormant for a couple years. I was also pretty busy with school and trying to write my original fiction and be an adult (ugh). Though in this period I did have the idea for <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17942843/chapters/42372563\" target=\"_blank\">Jon of the Kingsguard</a> and dashed out a rough draft of about the first third in two days.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until about a year ago that I thought about the ship again. I can\u2019t really remember why; I was going through a rough period so it may be that I just wanted to lose myself in any fic. And luckily this time I almost immediately found some good fic and it started generating fic ideas of my own. For about a month I fought the temptation to write them: I\u2019ve always wanted to be a full time writer, and I felt like putting time into fic was ultimately going to be a distraction.</p><p>But there\u2019s only so long you can resist your muse (that fickle bitch), and that\u2019s when I sat down and started writing <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16590095/chapters/38878928\" target=\"_blank\">Tipsy in a Red Push Up Bra</a>. And I\u2019m so, so glad I did. Not only have I written more in the last year than I have in the three or four years before that, but it\u2019s given me the chance to meet so many cool people here and read really excellent fic.</p><p>This answer got long (a writer who likes to talk about themselves? Shocking, I know), so I spun the next two questions into their own posts.</p><p>Thanks for the question!</p>",
