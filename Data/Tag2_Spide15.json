Whatever he might have been expecting, what he got wasn\u2019t\nit, but he <i>certainly </i>wasn\u2019t complaining.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Oh\nyou look so pretty like this baby, such a pretty mess.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Peter\nonly managed to make a half garbled groan around the fingers in his\nmouth as he tried to arch up into Steve&rsquo;s body only to be pushed back\ndown by the large hand resting on his stomach.</p><p>\u2018\u2019No\nno, you stay there. Silly little sluts don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for\nthem, only daddy knows what\u2019s good for you.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Peter\nwhimpered, eyelids fluttering as his body jerked with each thrust Steve\nmade, his sweat sticky skin clinging uncomfortably to the glass top\nof the desk he laid out on. The lacy bralet he\u2019d had on was now\naround his waist where Steve had yanked it down to get access to his\nnipples and the matching panties were now just a scrap of fabric on\nthe floor.</p><p>The\nhand on his stomach moved around to grip his hip bruisingly tight and\nlift him away from the surface. Peter squirmed desperately as\nSteve slammed into his prostate, \u2018\u2019Daddy-!\u2019\u2019 he slurred\naround Steves&rsquo; fingers.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Ah-\nStay still pretty girl, daddy\u2019s busy filling your lovely pussy up, just stay still\nfor me,\u2019\u2019 Steve hummed, eyes fixed on where he was sliding in and\nout of Peter rather than on his face.</p><p>Peter\nsucked desperately on the fingers and whined high in his throat; the\ncock inside him was so much stimulation but he was getting nothing\nelse and he just <i>wanted more</i>. He squeezed his eyes shut and\ndesperately tried to push down against Steve, rolling his body as\nmuch as Steves hold and his limited range of movement would allow but\njust as he started to get worked up he felt Steve go still. He opened\nhis eyes to find Steve staring down at him; to most others, his expression would probably look reasonably neutral, but Peter could\ntell by the way Steves&rsquo; lips were pressed together, the slight\nnarrowing of his eyes that he was pissed.</p><p>The\nbeat of silence seemed to stretch on with them looking each other and\nwhen Steve moved he moved so quickly Peter didn\u2019t even see the slap\ncoming, but he certainly felt it. He clutched his hand to his face,\ntears filling his eyes a the shock and sting and he opened his mouth\nto say something, but before he could figure out what that was, Steve\nspat in his face, wet and sharp on his cheek.</p><p>\u2018\u2019I\ntold you, to stay still, doll\u2019\u2019 Steves&rsquo; voice was low and he spoke\nslowly, but it was a thousand times more threatening than any shouting\ncould be, \u2018\u2019I told you, daddy is <i>busy, </i>you are mine to\nuse baby girl and I was doing what is my right. You\u2019re meant to\nstay there and look lovely for me, that\u2019s what you\u2019re good for.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Peters\nmouth open and closed a few times as he tried to find words but he\nwas so shocked and still impaled on Steves cock that all that came\nout was a huffed, slightly sad squeak. The expression on Steves&rsquo; face\nsoftened a little, his head tilting as he started to rock slowly\nagain, just sliding a few inches in and out him at a time, making\nPeter feel as though his boyfriend was teasing every nerve ending in\nhis body.</p><p>Steve\nreached out and slowly wiped the spit from Peters&rsquo; cheek before\nleaving his large hand there cupping his boyfriends sore face, \u2018\u2019Oh baby\u2026 You\u2019re\njust a pathetic little thing aren\u2019t you, just a pretty idiot once\nyou\u2019re on daddy\u2019s cock. I shouldn\u2019t blame you too much for\nbeing unable to follow instructions. You\u2019re just my sweet dumb\ndoll,\u2019\u2019 he cooed.</p><p>Peter\nstared up at him, his eyes still watery and his lips parted as the\nsparks of pleasure rushed through him and his brain tried to catch\nup. He was overwhelmed and turned on, his little cock hard and\nleaking against his tummy, twitching each time the head of Steves\ndick pressed against his prostate. He could feel himself trembling as he tried to press up, trying to work for more but eventually under his\nstrong boyfriends gentle gaze, Peter just gave in, his body going\nlax, letting Steve take his weight with the hand that he\u2019d slid around\nto the small of Peters back.</p><p>\u2018\u2019There\nwe go, daddy has you, baby. You just lie there and look pretty for me.\nYou do look so pretty Pete, my pretty little girl. My lovely dumb little\ndoll, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u2019 Steves movements picked up in pace, getting\nback to solid, hard slams into Peters now plaint form.</p><p>\u2018\u2019Daddy-\u2019\u2019\nPeter whined, getting cut off when Steve jammed two fingers back into\nhis mouth and pressed down on his tongue, stopping him being able to\ntalk, he could only gurgle and gasp for air as his body moved against\nthe glass, all his muscles loose, skin being pulled and pinched but he\ndidn\u2019t <i>care </i>because Steve was fucking him and calling him\nall his favorite pet names.</p><p>His\norgasm snuck up on him and all of a sudden he was gripping at Steves\nbicep to let him know he wasn\u2019t going to be able to stop it.</p><p>\u2018\u2019It\u2019s\nalright baby, come for me. Squeeze my cock like a good girl.

He could feel himself trembling as he tried to press up, trying to work for more but eventually under his\nstrong boyfriends gentle gaze, Peter just gave in, his body going\nlax, letting Steve take his weight with the hand that he&rsquo;d slid around\nto the small of Peters back.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;There\nwe go, daddy has you, baby. You just lie there and look pretty for me.\nYou do look so pretty Pete, my pretty little girl. My lovely dumb little\ndoll, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rsquo; Steves movements picked up in pace, getting\nback to solid, hard slams into Peters now plaint form.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Daddy-&rsquo;&rsquo;\nPeter whined, getting cut off when Steve jammed two fingers back into\nhis mouth and pressed down on his tongue, stopping him being able to\ntalk, he could only gurgle and gasp for air as his body moved against\nthe glass, all his muscles loose, skin being pulled and pinched but he\ndidn&rsquo;t <i>care </i>because Steve was fucking him and calling him\nall his favorite pet names.</p><p>His\norgasm snuck up on him and all of a sudden he was gripping at Steves\nbicep to let him know he wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to stop it.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s\nalright baby, come for me. Squeeze my cock like a good girl. I love\nyour tight little pussy baby, it&rsquo;s like your made to take me, made\nfor me to use,&rsquo;&rsquo; Steve grunted.</p><p>That\ndid it for Peter and he came over his own stomach, some spurting all\nthe way up to his chest and as he tried to moan but choked on all the\nsaliva in his mouth, lots of it spilling from the corners, his\nmuscles all convulsing as he tried to gasp for air while he came\ndown, feeling like he was floating there on the desk.</p><p>His unfocused eyes landed on Steve who was now moving with no control,\njust chasing his orgasm with Peters body,</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;fuck-\nlook at you, all fucked stupid by daddy. This is how you&rsquo;re meant\nto be. Filthy cum hungry slut, aren&rsquo;t you Pete? You want every drop\nI-&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Peter\nreveled in the moan that Steve cut himself off with and felt the wonderful familiar warmth of Steves cum filling him relax him even\nmore.</p><p>Still\nout of breath Steve gathered Peter up and moved them to the bed where\nPeter nuzzled into his chest.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;you&rsquo;re such a good boy Pete, I\nlove you so much.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Peter\njust gave a happy hum that made Steve chuckle and pressed closer to\nhim.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;re\nactually the smartest person I know, but I think it is safe to say I\nfuck you a little bit stupid.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>It\nwas Peters turn to laugh a little and he nodded, &lsquo;&rsquo;hm, I can\nconfirm that&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;m always pretty though right?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Steve\ncupped his face again and tilled it up before pressing a kiss to his\nnose, &lsquo;&rsquo;the prettiest.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>",
