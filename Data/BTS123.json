His thumbs drag across your stiff nipples, and very slow circle that passes over them has your innards clenching with excitement - your lip bitten to withhold all the gasps that threaten to part them. \u00a0</p><p>You watch, insides quivering, as Jin\u2019s pillow soft lips pass over every inch of your stomach in a series of slow, lingering kisses. \u00a0With his eyes closed he looks so serene; so handsome that it steals your breath away when he opens them and gazes up into yours.</p><p>In an almost trance-like state, you take off your top and let it fall carelessly to the floor so that Jin can take immediate advantage of your newly exposed skin. \u00a0His kisses turn into wet flicks and licks of his tongue along your breastbone, all the way up till his face is nestled in your cleavage. He turns his head to the side to kiss the swell of your breast with a hum that sounds almost wistful; longing..</p><p>Threading your fingers gently through his hair, Jin is easily persuaded to turn his mouth\u2019s attention towards your nipple. \u00a0A soft sigh escapes as you as he encases it with his lips, teasing your areola with the tip of his tongue whilst his thumb works the other, your back arching to press your breasts further into his eager hands. \u00a0</p><p>The pleasure may feel exquisite but it\u2019s almost more than you can bear. \u00a0Your body is more than ready and willing to receive him after having already brought Jin to a climax; each touch incensing you further, panting so hard that you&rsquo;re light-headed with desire. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJin,\u201d you utter quietly, pushing his hair back to better see his face. \u00a0His strong jaw moves with every motion of his tongue as he sucks and licks and laps at you, a light crease of concentration etched into his brow as he works. \u00a0\u201cSeokjin,\u201d you say again when he doesn&rsquo;t respond, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>His eyes open as he lets your spit-slick nipple fall from his mouth, the corners of it cocked into a smirk. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m trying to savour you, sweetheart,\u201d he tells you, placing another soft kiss to the space just above your navel. \u201cPatience.\u201d \u00a0Eyes closing once more, Jin&rsquo;s mouth begins to work lower as his hands do the same, skimming over your lower back and buttocks while his lips trace the waistband of your bottoms, infuriatingly slow.</p><p>You&rsquo;re about to start pleading again when Jin suddenly gropes your behind with both hands, squeezing. \u00a0He pushes his face right between your legs and inhales, the sound of it nothing short of obscene.</p><p>\u201cJin!\u201d you gasp as heat floods into your cheeks, scandalised by his unexpectedly brazen behaviour. \u00a0Despite you pushing at his head and squeezing your thighs together to try to discourage him all this does is make Jin laugh and nuzzle further into you, and when he finally does withdraw it&rsquo;s not without knocking the tip of his nose right into your clit to weaken your knees, first. \u00a0</p><p>He rests his cheek against your stomach and smiles sweetly up at you, watching the way you squirm from the confusing mixture of embarrassment and arousal that&rsquo;s coursing through you.</p><p>\u201cYou still don&rsquo;t get just how intoxicating your scent is, do you?\u201d Jin asks, and despite the teasing glimmer in his eyes, his words sound sincere. \u00a0\u201cI&rsquo;ve wanted to gorge myself between these thighs more times than I can count.\u201d You gasp as Jin&rsquo;s hands slip further down from your buttocks to the backs of your thighs, his fingertips mere inches away from brushing your core. \u00a0</p><p>Your cheeks redden further, knowing Jin must be able to feel how sopping wet you are through the barrier of your thin clothes. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially</i> when you&rsquo;re menstruating,\u201d he continues, eyes closing as if experiencing some sort of tortured bliss at the mere thought of it. \u201c<i>God</i>. \u00a0You&rsquo;ve no fucking clue.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>When you\u2026 w-when&hellip;</p><p>Your body that had been practically buzzing with excitement suddenly falls still, your stomach dropping unpleasantly. \u00a0</p><p>You&rsquo;re not sure why it comes as such a shock, really, to have Jin mention it. \u00a0When you&rsquo;d first moved into the mansion Jimin had warned you that it would likely be best to avoid the other vampires within the house at certain points of your cycle and to begin with. you\u2019d presumed this was purely for your safety - too much blood flowing freely was bound to be a temptation, after all. \u00a0As time had gone on, though, and you\u2019d experienced your first period in Jimin\u2019s presence and witnessed just how insatiable he\u2019d become - in more ways than one - you began to understand that it might\u2019ve been for an entirely different purpose he&rsquo;d advised you to hide away.</p><p>True, it\u2019d taken you a while to get over your own squeamishness about that particular method of feeding. \u00a0You couldn&rsquo;t think of much else more disgusting, quite frankly, but later on, after having seen how Yoongi was similarly enthusiastic about it, you&rsquo;d been able to let go, happy that you were able to provide your lovers such nourishment.</p><p>You\u2019d gotten the feeling the vampires had made an effort to avoid you during those times, too, but you&rsquo;d always presumed it was Jimin who&rsquo;d warned them away rather than them having a direct awareness of it. \u00a0To find out that Jin has been able to smell it every single month is\u2026 a little mortifying to say the least.</p><p>\u201cY-you can\u2026?\u201d \u00a0Jin&rsquo;s smile broadens, his palms rubbing soothingly down the backs of your legs and slipping beneath the hem of your bottoms on their way back up. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, sweetheart,\u201d he teases, \u201cThere aren&rsquo;t walls thick enough that&rsquo;d keep the scent of you away.\u201d \u00a0You bite your lip, legs quaking as his fingertips feather across the space where your thighs end and the curve of your buttocks begins. It&rsquo;s only when you neglect to say anything more that Jin seems to realise how awkward about it you feel. \u00a0\u201cPlease, don&rsquo;t be embarrassed,\u201d he encourages, pausing to place a gentle kiss to your abdomen. \u201cMaybe Jungkook or some of the others might shy away from it, but the more mature of us - the more experienced - know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ve tried it, then?\u201d To be honest, you&rsquo;d always presumed that Jin&rsquo;s experience of real physical intimacy with women had come to an abrupt and complete end the very moment he\u2019d been turned. \u00a0Apparently, you\u2019d thought wrong.</p><p>Jin huffs a wry laugh, his smile no longer quite meeting his eyes the way it had before. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNamjoon and I shared many experiences just after we were first turned\u2026 and well, let&rsquo;s just say I\u2019ve been one to turn down a free meal.\u201d \u00a0You feel your eyes widen almost comically at the mention of Namjoon&rsquo;s name, but thankfully Jin is too busy kissing your stomach to notice that his words have given you pause. \u00a0</p><p>When he says \u2018shared\u2019, does that mean\u2026? \u00a0Before tonight you never in your wildest dreams would\u2019ve thought that Jin and Namjoon would harbour similar sexual appetites. \u00a0In your mind, the two of them couldn&rsquo;t be more like chalk and cheese, but it sounds as though the eldest vampire likes to be a little more savage between the sheets than you\u2019d originally expected\u2026. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet&rsquo;s get a proper look at you, sweetheart,\u201d you hear Jin mumble as he hooks his thumbs into the waistband of your bottoms, distracting you from your thoughts. \u00a0He slowly inches them down, and you try not to blush once they pass over the thickest part of your thighs and then fall to the floor, taking a thick, glossy strand of your arousal with them. \u00a0</p><p>He parts your labia with his thumbs and smiles at the sight of your engorged clit, his touch all too fleeting. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he decides, and quicker than you can blink Jin suddenly stands and lifts you, gasping, off of your feet, placing you right back down on the cold surface of the dining table. \u00a0Lying you down, he grins wolfishly at the way you shudder and takes a moment to stand at the edge of the table, unbuttoning his shirt as he surveys you laid out beneath him.</p><p>\u201cFunny isn&rsquo;t it,\u201d Jin begins once his shirt hangs open to expose the subtle musculature of his chest, \u201cThat you&rsquo;re the only meal this table will have ever seen.\u201d \u00a0You can&rsquo;t seem to muster a reply, too focused on remembering to breathe as Jin nonchalantly reaches into your glass tumbler and retrieves a remaining cube of ice. Grasped between his thumb and forefinger, he shows it to you before popping it into his mouth. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-what are you-?\u201d you begin as he leans over you, your sentence cut short by the freezing cold kiss he presses between your cleavage and the strangled sound that bursts forth from your lungs. \u00a0Jin\u2019s hands are rested on each of your thighs as his mouth wanders, the ice held between his puckered lips to drag it directly across your skin as you try to keep your body from flinching underneath him, instinct causing you to try and wriggle away from the unfamiliar sensation. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d \u00a0The exclamation escapes you before you can hold it back as Jin diverts from the trail of icy water he\u2019s smeared between your breasts and turns his attention to your nipples.. \u00a0\u201cHoly s-shit, that\u2019s cold\u2026\u201d When his eyes open they\u2019re full of devilish delight, watching the way your eyebrows furrow and you bite your lip as he slowly rubs the ice slowly back and forth over the painfully hardened peak. \u00a0</p><p>Under his loving assault, your sensitive flesh flushes from pink to red - numb with cold and yet somehow tingling and throbbing all at once - and god, you love the way it feels. \u00a0Your fingers flex, fingernails pressing into the surface of the table for purchase as Jin reaches for another piece of ice and begins to rub that one into your other nipple to make you gasp and bow all over again.</p><p>Slowly, each cube begins to melt, and your body shudders as tiny droplets of icy water dribble down the sides of your breasts. \u00a0Jin swallows the remains of what&rsquo;s left in his mouth but his kiss remains just as cold even without the ice caught between his teeth, goosebumps rising along your skin as he abandons your breasts in favour of trailing his lips down your stomach.</p><p>\u201cOne more, I think.\u201d \u00a0Tipping your chin forward, you see Jin pluck another ice cube from his glass. \u00a0He glances at you, smiling, as he pops it in his mouth and then leans over you and deposits it directly into the dip of your belly-button, chuckling when your whole body jolts underneath him. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou&rsquo;re so responsive, sweetheart,\u201d he admires as you pant and shiver, willing the ice to melt as fast as possible as you stare down at it. With the way Jin has you burning up, surely it shouldn&rsquo;t take long? \u00a0\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>His kiss travels lower as his hands caress your thighs, and you find yourself holding your breath in anticipation as Jin drops into a deep squat and pushes gently at your knees, spreading you open. \u00a0You feel the softness of Jin\u2019s mouth press kisses into the inside of your thighs, from one side to the other as they climb ever higher and higher, closer to your core.</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, ok?\u201d you hear him say, and you can feel each word right between your legs, close enough to feel his breath. \u201cLet me know if I\u2019m not meeting your expectations,\u201d he adds. \u00a0The smile you can hear in his voice helps to make you relax, unwinding the tightness in your shoulders as you smile up at the ceiling, biting your lip to withhold a giggle.</p><p>Trust him to try and make you laugh at a time like this. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Jin\u2019s lips are so breathtakingly cold that the first touch them makes your whole body jump on contact, falling still only once he\u2019s taken hold of your hips to hold you in place to better trace every inch of your anatomy with his tongue. \u00a0You wish he&rsquo;d done it sooner; by moving so sharply you&rsquo;d managed to make the small amount of melted water in your navel spill over, and now you&rsquo;re driven to distraction by the feel of it dribbling slowly down your side, tickling as it goes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d you groan as he steals your attention back with a firm swipe against your clitoris, top to bottom and then side to side, wriggling figures of eight into tight little nub as his head tilts from side to side, his nose pressed close to your pubic mound. \u00a0With every flick the most gorgeous jolts of pleasure ascend your spine, fogging your brain till you\u2019re completely lost to anything else than the sensations between your legs.</p><p>His hair is soft when you reach down and thread your fingers through it - the finest of silks - and when you gently tug on it in encouragement, willing him to delve deeper, Jin is quick to oblige. \u00a0He hums in acknowledgement of your wishes, briefly opening his eyes to look up into yours as his licks turn into open mouth kisses that descend until his pouted lips are pressed directly to your entrance. \u00a0</p><p>Diligently, he begins to feast. \u00a0Jin lets no drop of your arousal go to waste, adding to it with the saliva that he licks into your pussy, the tip of his tongue dipping inside you as his nose rubs against your clit. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeokjin.\u201d \u00a0He gives no sign that he\u2019s heard your wanton moan save the tightening of his grip around your hips, far too absorbed in enjoying the task at hand to want to waste even a single second. \u00a0\u201cJin,\u201d you mewl, twisting in his hold as he returns to your clit and sucks it sharply between his lips. You\u2019re too far gone to care about the water spilling from your navel every time you shift on the table\u2019s surface, unconcerned with the fresh wave of goosebumps it summons across your skin. \u00a0\u201cYour fingers, p-please\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve done this enough times now to know that you struggle to find with clitoral stimulation alone; aching for that feeling of fullness inside. \u00a0All you want is for him to slip the digits that are now sliding from your hip and down your thigh inside of you, and your hips flex up from the table as though chasing after them as he unhurriedly draws them upward again, tickling. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re about reaching the limits of this \u2018patience\u2019 that Jin mentioned\u2026</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you beseech again, reaching out to take a hold of his wrist and drag his touch closer to where you so desperately need it only to have your hand slapped away, groaning in frustration when he removes himself from you. \u00a0It\u2019s his cocked eyebrow that you see first as he emerges from between your legs and stands to full height - his smirking mouth shortly after, slick with your essence.</p><p>He tuts loudly as he leans over you, one hand on the table and the other pinning your wrist by your side. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you always this impatient?\u201d he questions, cocking his head as he looks down at you. \u00a0\u00a0His bangs fall in front of his eyes, the rest of his hair slightly dishevelled from how often you\u2019ve run your fingers through it. \u00a0You bite your lip and glance away, cheeks red from his teasing chastisement. \u201cWell?\u201d he persists, squeezing at your wrist, \u201cAre you?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cM-maybe,\u201d you admit, willfully understating the size of your sexual appetite. \u00a0Ever since Jimin introduced to life\u2019s more carnal delights you\u2019ve hardly been able to get your fill; insatiable since the moment you met. \u00a0Would you be like this with any other lover, you wonder, or is it his influence and the company you keep that made you this way?</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019ve been spoiled.\u201d \u00a0Jin lets go of your wrist, his smile growing at the needful groan you release at the sliding of his palm along the inside of your thigh and your whine of discontent when he steals it away. \u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in always getting what you want right away?\u201d Again he brushes his fingertips against you; a brief passing of his index finger against your swollen clitoris. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find the rewards far more satisfying when you\u2019ve really had to work for them, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Desperately trying to ignore the fierce ache deep down within your abdomen, you sit up and lean back on your elbows, face flushed and bottom lip bitten as you ask,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d \u00a0Frankly, you\u2019re willing to do anything if it means Jin will actually<i> touch</i> you rather than torment you with the slow circles he\u2019s drawing in the wetness smeared across the tops of your thighs. \u00a0</p><p>Jin smiles, pleased, and then leans in to press a chaste kiss to your lips. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what you want&hellip; and just how much you want it,\u201d he breathes into your ear, soft and seductive, \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I want you,\u201d you begin, stating the obvious as Jin begins to smatter your skin in lingering kisses, your cheeks blazing with heat underneath the press of his lips. \u00a0\u201cWant you to fuck me, so bad.\u201d Another kiss to the slant of your jaw, your head tipping back.</p><p>Considering how imagining Jin in any kind of sexual context had made you blush so hotly, you can barely believe how carelessly you\u2019ve begun to speak. \u00a0With every centimetre his fingertips creep closer to your core the more shameless you become, barely even registering the garbled, filthy words that are falling from your mouth. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNeed your cock, Seokjin, please.\u201d \u00a0You make a grab for the front of his shirt where it remains hanging open, tugging on it for emphasis. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was it my fingers you wanted a second ago. \u00a0Which is it?\u201d he presses in that same teasing tone as before, sliding them slowly from top to bottom of your labia and then back up again. \u201cMake up your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything!\u201d you very nearly shout as he pinches at your clit, the sting of it so strong that it has you slumping from your elbows onto your back, skin slapping against the table. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnything,\u201d you repeat, softer, a lump forming in your throat as frustration threatens to overwhelm you completely - so tightly wound that your legs are beginning to tremble from wanting alone.</p><p>Closing your eyes in an attempt to calm yourself, you turn your head to the side to find Jin\u2019s hand waiting for you there. \u00a0He tenderly cradles your cheek in your palm as he kisses the other, the feel of his chest pressed to yours heavy and yet comforting in its coolness; a soothing balm against your fevered skin. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he praises, nuzzling you affectionately. \u00a0\u201cWanna be nice and tight for me, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Weakly, you nod, your breath hitching when you feel Jin reach between bodies and hear the rustling of fabric as he pushes his bottoms further down. \u00a0Soon enough, his blunt girth is pressing between your legs, hot and impatient, and you let your legs flop open wider as he begins to tease the weeping head back and forth amongst your wetness, lubricating himself. \u00a0</p><p>You know it\u2019ll be a stretch without Jin having eased you open first - you\u2019ve felt how thick he is first hand, after all - but by this point, you\u2019re well past caring. \u00a0You\u2019ll happily accommodate anything he\u2019s willing to give so long as it finally means you\u2019ll be granted some relief.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019ve got such a sweet little cunt,\u201d he grunts before seizing your mouth with his, releasing your face to grab at your hips and pull you right to the edge of the table so he can better angle himself to enter you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeokjin, <i>please</i>,\u201d you plead as he pushes barely an inch inside, waiting until the stretch has you tense and gasping before pulling back again \u00a0You\u2019re sure he\u2019s tormenting himself just as much as he is you; you can feel how taut his shoulders are as you slip your hands inside his shirt to grab at them, wrapping your legs around his waist. \u00a0</p><p>Jin silences you with kisses, consuming the moans you make as he shallowly dips the tip in and out of you again and again and again till it there\u2019s no longer any pain. \u00a0You\u2019re so ready by the time he\u2019s done that if he rocked his hips even just the slightest bit harder you know he\u2019d slip straight inside and as he stills once more, so tantalisingly close, you\u2019re praying he\u2019ll do just that.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me again,\u201d Jin mumbles against your lips. \u00a0You\u2019re caught off guard by the hint of vulnerability that you detect, but given all he\u2019s been through today it should really come as no surprise that he\u2019s craving reassurance that he\u2019s still needed - still loved even if it\u2019s not quite in the same way.</p><p>You kiss him, sweetly, and lift your forehead to press it to his. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you, Seokjin. \u00a0I want this, want you.\u201d \u00a0You feel Jin nod and see the furrow in his brow right before he kisses you again, forcing your eyes closed. \u00a0His hips tilt and your rise up to meet him, guiding him effortlessly into place, and with his lips moulded to yours, Jin starts to slowly push inside. \u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s such a snug fit that the feeling of his cock breaching you has the of you both panting for air before he\u2019s even fully seated inside. \u00a0Jin doesn\u2019t hesitate or falter, though, not stopping until his pelvis is sat flush with yours and a simple squeeze of your inner muscles has him gasping and digging his fingertips into the flesh of your thigh, his eyes screwed shut tight. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shibal</i>, I\u2019d forgotten how good this feels,\u201d Jin groans as he starts to move, smooth pushes and pulls that are neither too fast nor too slow. \u00a0\u201cSo warm.\u201d Jin cups your breast in his palm, kneading it firmly as he moves within you until a particular firm thrust has your whole body shifting, the table groaning beneath you with the force of it. \u00a0Wetness squelches around his cock as he does it again, grinning as you gasp and grab at his shoulders. \u201cSo fucking wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh g-god, Jin,\u201d you moan, clenching your thighs tighter around his waist, willing him not to stop. \u00a0You\u2019ve been waiting so long for this that you know it won\u2019t take long for you to cum. You can feel it building even now; the subtle curve of Jin\u2019s cock perfectly shaped to press against your g-spot with each and every thrust. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re squeezing so tight, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0Jin leans closer, closing the gap between your bodies so each rock of his hips has your breasts bouncing and his solid chest crashing into yours, \u00a0His mouth is on your neck, his breaths short and shallow against your skin. \u201cNo wonder the others can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>You whine mindlessly, so deliciously close that your toes are already starting to curl. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-harder, please,\u201d you pant breathlessly, digging your fingers into his hair and pushing him further into the crook of your neck. \u00a0You feel the lightest graze of his fangs against your throat and your whole pelvis clenches in response, your body well trained to anticipate the euphoria that being fed upon brings. \u00a0\u201cSeokjin, I\u2026 God, I\u2019m so close, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he smirks, lifting his head, \u201cYou like it a little rougher, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u00a0With his next thrust, Jin\u2019s hips come smacking savagely into yours, barely giving you any time to even catch your breath before he\u2019s pulling back and then slamming in again, lifting his chest off of yours and grabbing hold of your hips, towering over you. \u00a0</p><p>Try as he might, there\u2019s something about the position you\u2019re in that doesn\u2019t allow Jin to take you as fast as he would like. \u00a0Perhaps the table\u2019s too low or it\u2019s just not sturdy enough, but it feels like mere seconds before he\u2019s groaning with frustration and pulling out of you. \u00a0He grabs your hand, ignoring your questioning look.</p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d he demands, pulling you to your feet and clutching you to him, weakening your knees when he slips one hand between your legs and immediately slides two fingers inside. \u00a0You can hear every curl of his fingers as every knuckle becomes coated with your wetness, and as he kisses the breath out of you it\u2019s all you can do to clutch onto his shirt to stay upright. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve done this sooner,\u201d Jin tells you through gritted teeth, his free hand digging tightly into your waist, his cock weeping against your hip while you fall to pieces around his fingers. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever get sick of such a pretty cunt as yours.\u201d</p><p>Almost as though he can sense how close you are to the precipice, Jin withdraws his digits from you and your eyes open, your whole body trembling with the injustice of it. \u00a0You can barely keep yourself upright but Jin seems unconcerned, busy yanking off his shirt and tossing it to the ground to reveal his naked physique in all its glory.</p><p>\u201cBend over,\u201d he instructs, dragging to towards the counter and then releasing your arm only to push at your back, forcing you to bend from the waist and lift your rear into the air, clutching the edge. \u00a0\u201cYou wanted it harder, right, sweetheart?\u201d He bends right over you, his sticky chest flush to your back. \u201cBetter hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly straightens, the sound of his deep inhale the only warning that you get before Jin impales you on the length of his cock. \u00a0He drags you back by the hips as he thrusts forward just as hard, the bones of his pelvis slamming into the flesh of your buttocks. Relentless, Jin has you wailing as he takes you just as roughly as he promised, driving into you again and again. \u00a0Each snap is so savage that you\u2019re certain you\u2019ll have bruises once he\u2019s through but it\u2019s not as though you care.</p><p>You\u2019re finally getting what you wanted - about to cum so hard you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll even be able to remember your name once he\u2019s through. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSuch a good girl,\u201d Jin praises, out of breath with exertion, \u201cMade for taking our cocks, weren\u2019t you? \u00a0Such a good little plaything for her masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d you sob in reply, your cheek pressed to the counter as Jin\u2019s fingers find their way into your hair and he tugs at the roots, \u201cGod, <i>yes!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me how hard you can cum, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0He tightens his grip, pushing your cheek harder into the countertop, \u201c<i>Show me</i>.\u201d \u00a0And you do - spectacularly. \u00a0</p><p>The pleasure that rips through you is so intense that you have to press your face to the hard surface to muffle the cries that burst forth from your lungs, and your hands shake as you desperately cling to the counter because Jin doesn\u2019t let up. \u00a0All the while you keen and curse he continues to drive into you, fucking you through your orgasm and out to the other side.</p><p>\u201cJin, <i>please</i>,\u201d you gasp, but now it\u2019s mercy for which you beg. \u00a0It\u2019s too much when he reaches between your legs and starts to rub at your clit, so overwhelming that you\u2019re having to bite your bottom lip to keep from crying out. \u201cI c-ca-can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>At your protest Jin steps back, a growl rumbling from his chest as he grabs at your limbs from behind. \u00a0Like a ragdoll he manhandles you, pulling you up straight and spinning you round to face him and then surging forward to slam his lips into yours. \u00a0With his fingertips digging into your upper arms he walks you back until you hit something hard and cold; pleasant against your heated skin. It\u2019s only when he\u2019s picked you up and resumed such a vigorous pace that you hear the jars inside rattling with every thrust that you even realise it\u2019s the refrigerator he\u2019s fucking you against.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure\u2026 you want me to stop?\u201d \u00a0Jin\u2019s voice is wrecked from where he speaks down into the crook of your neck, his arms wrapped as tightly around your waist as yours are around his hips, your buttocks in his palms. \u201cYour cunt says otherwise.\u201d \u00a0He lifts his head and smashes his lips into yours, all teeth and tongues as his thrusts drive deep, biting out his words. \u201cI can feel you squeezing around my cock again already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-fuck,\u201d you choke into his kiss, your fingernails raking lines of red across into the shoulder blades to which you cling. \u00a0You\u2019re so drunk on oxytocin that you can barely string two words together - so high on lingering endorphins that your body feels as though it should sing - and you don\u2019t ever want this feeling to stop. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeen so good to me tonight,\u201d he huffs, visibly beginning to tire from the ruthlessness of his efforts in spite of the supernatural stamina he\u2019s blessed with. \u201cDo you think you can cum with me, sweetheart? \u00a0Show me -\u201d Jin has to pause mid-sentence to catch his breath, his eyes pressing closed at the feel of your walls closing in around him, pushing towards his release. \u201c - show me how much you love my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cK-keep going and\u2026 and I will,\u201d you promise, just as breathless. \u00a0</p><p>Your hand are in Jin\u2019s hair when he suddenly changes pace. \u00a0His thrusts slow and each time he pulls back it\u2019s barely even halfway, yet somehow it feels even better than before. \u00a0Now, instead of filthy, frantic rutting, it\u2019s a deep, dirty grind that has his pubic bone grinding against your clit like a pestle and mortar with every circle of his hips, the head of his cock brushing your sweetest spot over and over again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>S-seokjin</i>\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d you warn, digging your fingers into his scalp. \u00a0He groans in acknowledgement, his breath heavy in your ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2026 w-where do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d you answer without thought, your head falling back as the tide of pleasure begins to rise. \u00a0\u201cCum inside me, Jin. Oh <i>god</i>, I wanna feel you cum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Jin shouts, grabbing your ass so hard that it hurts. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s the slowest and deepest thrusts of all that finally push you both over the edge; each one dragged out as though he\u2019s trying to savour this last few precious seconds before it ends. \u00a0He\u2019s surprisingly quiet as he cums considering how vocal he\u2019s been so far but you can still feel how greatly he\u2019s affected. His cock pulses and twitches long after he\u2019s spilt every drop and it\u2019s started to drip down the inside of your thighs - his whole body trembling and his breaths similarly shuddering. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJin.\u201d \u00a0You utter his name ever so softly after a minute or so has passed where neither of you has moved nor said a word. \u00a0He has his forehead rested to yours, his eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks at the feel of you gently carding your fingers through his hair. \u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Part of you is worried that now the heat of the moment has passed Jin\u2019s mood might suddenly crash - that he might suddenly be overcome with guilt or regret everything that\u2019s just happened. \u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, when he opens his eyes and meets your gaze his smile may be small and somewhat lopsided, but at least it looks genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d \u00a0He begins the somewhat messy task of separating the two of you, adding, \u201cPromise,\u2019 when he sees the way you\u2019re searching his expression to see if anything looks amiss. \u00a0</p><p>Jin\u2019s nothing but attentive as he settles your feet back on the floor and waits until you\u2019re steady before leaving your side to collect the clothes that are strewn about the place. \u00a0He grins sheepishly as he comes back and sees you reaching for the roll of paper towels by the sink, thighs clenched together to avoid dripping onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he apologises as you wipe yourself clean with a grimace, wrinkling your nose at the scratchiness of the paper against your extra-sensitive parts. \u00a0\u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve picked a more practical location.\u201d Jin grins as you laugh, pulling on the clothes that he hands to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure there was enough forward planning involved for that\u2026.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he laughs along, pulling up his pants and then shrugging on his shirt. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t bother doing it up, though, just leaves it hanging open as he steps towards you with his hands outstretched. \u00a0Cupping your cheeks, Jin dips his head to kiss you.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d \u00a0His voice is tight with emotion as he says it, not yet pulling away. \u201cI think I needed that.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u201d you answer easily, slipping your hands under his shirt to press your palms to the flat of his back, gently caressing. You\u2019re relieved to feel how relaxed his muscles are beneath your hands - how slow and steady his breathing is. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t too rough?\u201d \u00a0You smile as Jin straightens up, his expression mildly embarrassed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNever too rough,\u201d you assure him, your tone turning playful after as you add, \u201cSo\u2026 my \u2018masters\u2019, eh?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Jin laughs heartily, taking a step back and rubbing awkwardly at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou caught that, huh?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d you giggle, leaning back against the edge of the counter and folding your arms. \u201cMost definitely.\u201d \u00a0<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018daddy\u2019 is much better, is it?\u201d he teases, and as he finally starts to button up his shirt you snort out a laugh, smiling broadly. \u00a0He has a point, you suppose.</p><p>Jin begins to clear up while you remain basking in the afterglow a little longer, propped up against the counter as you wait for some strength to return to your jellified legs. \u00a0He hums as he collects all the bottles and glasses from the table and deposits them into the sink to wash another time, and you\u2019re glad he seems as though he\u2019s in a better mood now than the state in which you found him, even if it may only be temporary.</p><p>\u201cI still think you should talk to Soo-Mi, you know,\u201d you say after a little while, coming to stand at his side. \u00a0Jin frowns at the remnants of the wine he\u2019s pouring down the drain, and at the sight of his furrowed brow you place a soothing hand in the small of his back, kneading through his shirt. \u00a0\u201cObviously it\u2019s your call, but I think it\u2019d be a shame to just let things go after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d He shrugs non committedly, sighing as he places the bottle down on the side to dry. \u00a0Turning around, he very gently passes his thumb across your cheek, smiling as you lean into it. \u00a0\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, \u201cWe should get you to bed. I&rsquo;ve kept you up long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming with, then?\u201d you chuckle when Jin offers you his hand, slipping your fingers between his without hesitation. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it, but I could hardly call myself a gentleman if I didn\u2019t at least walk you to your door, could I?\u201d \u00a0Well, you can hardly argue with that.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for you to arrive at Jimin\u2019s door. \u00a0Rather than let you go once you get there, however, Jin turns to you and takes your left hand as well, his expression earnest. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you again, for tonight,\u201d he says, squeezing your hands good and tight. \u00a0\u201cI really enjoyed it and\u2026 I hope you did too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d you smile, squeezing back. \u00a0Could there really be any doubt?</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d he grins, his normal bravado swiftly re-emerging now he\u2019s been suitably reassured. \u00a0\u201cGoodnight then, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight Jinnie.\u201d \u00a0You kiss him goodnight on your tiptoes and after one final squeeze of his hands, you disentangle your fingers from his and head into Jimin\u2019s room, grinning at the kiss he blows your way just the door presses shut. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re almost pleased to find that Jimin and Yoongi aren\u2019t home yet, your bed empty save where Nova is curled up in a ball on Yoongi\u2019s pillow. \u00a0It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not looking forward to seeing them, more that you know that if they were there waiting to beckon you under the duvet you wouldn\u2019t have the willpower to resist joining them despite the shower you so desperately need. \u00a0</p><p>You head to the bathroom without delay, stripping out of the clothes you&rsquo;ve only just recently put back on along the way. \u00a0The water\u2019s blissfully warm and it feels amazing against the soreness Jin left behind. You&rsquo;re so absorbed enjoying the heat of it seeping into your limbs, in fact, that you don&rsquo;t even realise you&rsquo;re no longer alone in the bathroom until the cubicle door opens and you feel hands upon your hips - lips brushing the back of your neck. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought you&rsquo;d already be in bed.\u201d \u00a0The familiar sound of Yoongi\u2019s low, gravelly voice relaxes you instantly and you lean back against his chest, releasing a contented hum when his lithe arms wrap around your waist. \u00a0\u201cJimin shouldn&rsquo;t be long. He&rsquo;s just speaking to Hoseok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, good,\u201d you sigh, luxuriating in the slow, soothing kisses he&rsquo;s trailing along the length of your neck. \u00a0\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d \u00a0You smile at Yoongi&rsquo;s self-assuredness, placing your hands on top of his to stop them from drifting up to fondle your breasts as you know he&rsquo;d been intending. \u00a0Your nipples are still far too sensitive for that thanks to all Jin&rsquo;s pinching and tweaking. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d he admits with a chuckle when you nudge him in the ribs with your elbow. \u00a0\u201cSo\u2026 why are you up so late?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly you\u2019re beset by a rush of nerves, mouth hanging open as you search for the courage it takes to reply. \u00a0You know that you need to tell Jimin and Yoongi about what&rsquo;s just happened with Jin, and you know that you all agreed to be honest with one another and that permission was no longer required but\u2026 what if the reality of it turns out to be more than they&rsquo;re able to bear? \u00a0What if Jimin changes his mind?</p><p>\u201cJin and Soo-Mi broke up,\u201d you begin, fiddling with fingers nervously where they rest upon your stomach, \u201cAnd he was\u2026 a little bit of a mess when I got home. \u00a0Found him in the kitchen busy drinking his own body weight in booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrowning his sorrows, hm? \u00a0Always a good plan,\u201d Yoongi muses dryly, and when you turn around in his arms, wet chest to wet chest, you see the slightest of smiles tugging at his lips. \u201cSo, I&rsquo;m guessing you helped him feel better, hm?\u201d \u00a0There\u2019s something about the way one of Yoongi\u2019s eyebrows rises and the slightly playful tone to his voice that has you blushing and glancing at your feet. Before you can say anything more or start to ramble your excuses, \u00a0Yoongi graces you with a gentle kiss, soothing your anxieties. \u201cI could smell him on your clothes, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d \u00a0You hesitate as the dark-haired vampire releases you and reaches for the shampoo, lathering up his hair. \u00a0\u201cYou&rsquo;re not mad, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? \u00a0No.\u201d He prises one eye open to peek at you, foamy suds dripping down his forehead. \u00a0\u201cIf it helped then I&rsquo;m glad, as long as he treated you right. It&rsquo;s been a long time since <i>hyung </i>got laid&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d you confirm, pressing your body to his to sneak back under the water regardless of the risk of getting wayward shampoo splashes in your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Yoongi replies once all the remaining shampoo is gone and he&rsquo;s passed his hands over his face, wiping the water out of his eyes. \u00a0Leaning past him, you take the shampoo for yourself, squirting a generous amount into your palm.</p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2026\u201d You glance at Yoongi who&rsquo;s listening attentively, his gaze straying only momentarily when your arms extend above your head and your chest bounces with the motion. \u00a0\u201cDo you think Jimin will mind\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn&rsquo;t,\u201d Yoongi answers quickly, \u201cAnd if he does then just leave him to me.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You have to admit, it&rsquo;s more than a little reassuring to know that Yoongi&rsquo;s got your back should Jimin decide to become jealous despite everything you agreed. \u00a0Although Jimin may take the lead in the bedroom, you know that he respects the elder vampire greatly as his <i>hyung. \u00a0</i>Calm and collected, you&rsquo;ve seen how Yoongi\u2019s cool temper helps douse Jimin&rsquo;s natural fire, though in this case you really hope it won&rsquo;t be necessary. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere, let me,\u201d Yoongi beckons, hands on your waist to turn you around so that your back is facing him and he&rsquo;s able to take over washing your hair, his long fingers like heaven as they massage at your scalp. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you say softly, biting back a moan as he rubs firmly at your temples. \u00a0You don&rsquo;t just mean for the head rub, and you hope Yoongi realises that.</p><p>\u201cAnytime princess.\u201d \u00a0The two of you fall silent for a while after that, and as Yoongi replaces the shampoo in your hair with conditioner, combing it through, it takes every bit of willpower you possess not to fall asleep while you&rsquo;re leant against him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he suddenly exclaims causing you to very nearly jump out of your skin, head swinging round to look over your shoulder with wide and startled eyes. \u00a0\u201cI bet that bastard drank all my Barolo, didn&rsquo;t he?!\u201d</p>",

each touch incensing you further, panting so hard that you\u2019re light-headed with desire. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJin,\u201d you utter quietly, pushing his hair back to better see his face. \u00a0His strong jaw moves with every motion of his tongue as he sucks and licks and laps at you, a light crease of concentration etched into his brow as he works. \u00a0\u201cSeokjin,\u201d you say again when he doesn\u2019t respond, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>His eyes open as he lets your spit-slick nipple fall from his mouth, the corners of it cocked into a smirk. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to savour you, sweetheart,\u201d he tells you, placing another soft kiss to the space just above your navel. \u201cPatience.\u201d \u00a0Eyes closing once more, Jin\u2019s mouth begins to work lower as his hands do the same, skimming over your lower back and buttocks while his lips trace the waistband of your bottoms, infuriatingly slow.</p><p>You\u2019re about to start pleading again when Jin suddenly gropes your behind with both hands, squeezing. \u00a0He pushes his face right between your legs and inhales, the sound of it nothing short of obscene.</p><p>\u201cJin!\u201d you gasp as heat floods into your cheeks, scandalised by his unexpectedly brazen behaviour. \u00a0Despite you pushing at his head and squeezing your thighs together to try to discourage him all this does is make Jin laugh and nuzzle further into you, and when he finally does withdraw it\u2019s not without knocking the tip of his nose right into your clit to weaken your knees, first. \u00a0</p><p>He rests his cheek against your stomach and smiles sweetly up at you, watching the way you squirm from the confusing mixture of embarrassment and arousal that\u2019s coursing through you.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t get just how intoxicating your scent is, do you?\u201d Jin asks, and despite the teasing glimmer in his eyes, his words sound sincere. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to gorge myself between these thighs more times than I can count.\u201d You gasp as Jin\u2019s hands slip further down from your buttocks to the backs of your thighs, his fingertips mere inches away from brushing your core. \u00a0</p><p>Your cheeks redden further, knowing Jin must be able to feel how sopping wet you are through the barrier of your thin clothes. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially</i> when you\u2019re menstruating,\u201d he continues, eyes closing as if experiencing some sort of tortured bliss at the mere thought of it. \u201c<i>God</i>. \u00a0You\u2019ve no fucking clue.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>When you\u2026 w-when\u2026</p><p>Your body that had been practically buzzing with excitement suddenly falls still, your stomach dropping unpleasantly. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re not sure why it comes as such a shock, really, to have Jin mention it. \u00a0When you\u2019d first moved into the mansion Jimin had warned you that it would likely be best to avoid the other vampires within the house at certain points of your cycle and to begin with. you\u2019d presumed this was purely for your safety - too much blood flowing freely was bound to be a temptation, after all. \u00a0As time had gone on, though, and you\u2019d experienced your first period in Jimin\u2019s presence and witnessed just how insatiable he\u2019d become - in more ways than one - you began to understand that it might\u2019ve been for an entirely different purpose he\u2019d advised you to hide away.</p><p>True, it\u2019d taken you a while to get over your own squeamishness about that particular method of feeding. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t think of much else more disgusting, quite frankly, but later on, after having seen how Yoongi was similarly enthusiastic about it, you\u2019d been able to let go, happy that you were able to provide your lovers such nourishment.</p><p>You\u2019d gotten the feeling the vampires had made an effort to avoid you during those times, too, but you\u2019d always presumed it was Jimin who\u2019d warned them away rather than them having a direct awareness of it. \u00a0To find out that Jin has been able to smell it every single month is\u2026 a little mortifying to say the least.</p><p>\u201cY-you can\u2026?\u201d \u00a0Jin\u2019s smile broadens, his palms rubbing soothingly down the backs of your legs and slipping beneath the hem of your bottoms on their way back up. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, sweetheart,\u201d he teases, \u201cThere aren\u2019t walls thick enough that\u2019d keep the scent of you away.\u201d \u00a0You bite your lip, legs quaking as his fingertips feather across the space where your thighs end and the curve of your buttocks begins. It\u2019s only when you neglect to say anything more that Jin seems to realise how awkward about it you feel. \u00a0\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be embarrassed,\u201d he encourages, pausing to place a gentle kiss to your abdomen. \u201cMaybe Jungkook or some of the others might shy away from it, but the more mature of us - the more experienced - know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried it, then?\u201d To be honest, you\u2019d always presumed that Jin\u2019s experience of real physical intimacy with women had come to an abrupt and complete end the very moment he\u2019d been turned. \u00a0Apparently, you\u2019d thought wrong.</p><p>Jin huffs a wry laugh, his smile no longer quite meeting his eyes the way it had before. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNamjoon and I shared many experiences just after we were first turned\u2026 and well, let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve been one to turn down a free meal.\u201d \u00a0You feel your eyes widen almost comically at the mention of Namjoon\u2019s name, but thankfully Jin is too busy kissing your stomach to notice that his words have given you pause. \u00a0</p><p>When he says \u2018shared\u2019, does that mean\u2026? \u00a0Before tonight you never in your wildest dreams would\u2019ve thought that Jin and Namjoon would harbour similar sexual appetites. \u00a0In your mind, the two of them couldn\u2019t be more like chalk and cheese, but it sounds as though the eldest vampire likes to be a little more savage between the sheets than you\u2019d originally expected\u2026. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a proper look at you, sweetheart,\u201d you hear Jin mumble as he hooks his thumbs into the waistband of your bottoms, distracting you from your thoughts. \u00a0He slowly inches them down, and you try not to blush once they pass over the thickest part of your thighs and then fall to the floor, taking a thick, glossy strand of your arousal with them. \u00a0</p><p>He parts your labia with his thumbs and smiles at the sight of your engorged clit, his touch all too fleeting. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he decides, and quicker than you can blink Jin suddenly stands and lifts you, gasping, off of your feet, placing you right back down on the cold surface of the dining table. \u00a0Lying you down, he grins wolfishly at the way you shudder and takes a moment to stand at the edge of the table, unbuttoning his shirt as he surveys you laid out beneath him.</p><p>\u201cFunny isn\u2019t it,\u201d Jin begins once his shirt hangs open to expose the subtle musculature of his chest, \u201cThat you\u2019re the only meal this table will have ever seen.\u201d \u00a0You can\u2019t seem to muster a reply, too focused on remembering to breathe as Jin nonchalantly reaches into your glass tumbler and retrieves a remaining cube of ice. Grasped between his thumb and forefinger, he shows it to you before popping it into his mouth. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-what are you-?\u201d you begin as he leans over you, your sentence cut short by the freezing cold kiss he presses between your cleavage and the strangled sound that bursts forth from your lungs. \u00a0Jin\u2019s hands are rested on each of your thighs as his mouth wanders, the ice held between his puckered lips to drag it directly across your skin as you try to keep your body from flinching underneath him, instinct causing you to try and wriggle away from the unfamiliar sensation. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d \u00a0The exclamation escapes you before you can hold it back as Jin diverts from the trail of icy water he\u2019s smeared between your breasts and turns his attention to your nipples.. \u00a0\u201cHoly s-shit, that\u2019s cold\u2026\u201d When his eyes open they\u2019re full of devilish delight, watching the way your eyebrows furrow and you bite your lip as he slowly rubs the ice slowly back and forth over the painfully hardened peak. \u00a0</p><p>Under his loving assault, your sensitive flesh flushes from pink to red - numb with cold and yet somehow tingling and throbbing all at once - and god, you love the way it feels. \u00a0Your fingers flex, fingernails pressing into the surface of the table for purchase as Jin reaches for another piece of ice and begins to rub that one into your other nipple to make you gasp and bow all over again.</p><p>Slowly, each cube begins to melt, and your body shudders as tiny droplets of icy water dribble down the sides of your breasts. \u00a0Jin swallows the remains of what\u2019s left in his mouth but his kiss remains just as cold even without the ice caught between his teeth, goosebumps rising along your skin as he abandons your breasts in favour of trailing his lips down your stomach.</p><p>\u201cOne more, I think.\u201d \u00a0Tipping your chin forward, you see Jin pluck another ice cube from his glass. \u00a0He glances at you, smiling, as he pops it in his mouth and then leans over you and deposits it directly into the dip of your belly-button, chuckling when your whole body jolts underneath him. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so responsive, sweetheart,\u201d he admires as you pant and shiver, willing the ice to melt as fast as possible as you stare down at it. With the way Jin has you burning up, surely it shouldn\u2019t take long? \u00a0\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>His kiss travels lower as his hands caress your thighs, and you find yourself holding your breath in anticipation as Jin drops into a deep squat and pushes gently at your knees, spreading you open. \u00a0You feel the softness of Jin\u2019s mouth press kisses into the inside of your thighs, from one side to the other as they climb ever higher and higher, closer to your core.</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, ok?\u201d you hear him say, and you can feel each word right between your legs, close enough to feel his breath. \u201cLet me know if I\u2019m not meeting your expectations,\u201d he adds. \u00a0The smile you can hear in his voice helps to make you relax, unwinding the tightness in your shoulders as you smile up at the ceiling, biting your lip to withhold a giggle.</p><p>Trust him to try and make you laugh at a time like this. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Jin\u2019s lips are so breathtakingly cold that the first touch them makes your whole body jump on contact, falling still only once he\u2019s taken hold of your hips to hold you in place to better trace every inch of your anatomy with his tongue. \u00a0You wish he\u2019d done it sooner; by moving so sharply you\u2019d managed to make the small amount of melted water in your navel spill over, and now you\u2019re driven to distraction by the feel of it dribbling slowly down your side, tickling as it goes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d you groan as he steals your attention back with a firm swipe against your clitoris, top to bottom and then side to side, wriggling figures of eight into tight little nub as his head tilts from side to side, his nose pressed close to your pubic mound. \u00a0With every flick the most gorgeous jolts of pleasure ascend your spine, fogging your brain till you\u2019re completely lost to anything else than the sensations between your legs.</p><p>His hair is soft when you reach down and thread your fingers through it - the finest of silks - and when you gently tug on it in encouragement, willing him to delve deeper, Jin is quick to oblige. \u00a0He hums in acknowledgement of your wishes, briefly opening his eyes to look up into yours as his licks turn into open mouth kisses that descend until his pouted lips are pressed directly to your entrance. \u00a0</p><p>Diligently, he begins to feast. \u00a0Jin lets no drop of your arousal go to waste, adding to it with the saliva that he licks into your pussy, the tip of his tongue dipping inside you as his nose rubs against your clit. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeokjin.\u201d \u00a0He gives no sign that he\u2019s heard your wanton moan save the tightening of his grip around your hips, far too absorbed in enjoying the task at hand to want to waste even a single second. \u00a0\u201cJin,\u201d you mewl, twisting in his hold as he returns to your clit and sucks it sharply between his lips. You\u2019re too far gone to care about the water spilling from your navel every time you shift on the table\u2019s surface, unconcerned with the fresh wave of goosebumps it summons across your skin. \u00a0\u201cYour fingers, p-please\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve done this enough times now to know that you struggle to find with clitoral stimulation alone; aching for that feeling of fullness inside. \u00a0All you want is for him to slip the digits that are now sliding from your hip and down your thigh inside of you, and your hips flex up from the table as though chasing after them as he unhurriedly draws them upward again, tickling. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re about reaching the limits of this \u2018patience\u2019 that Jin mentioned\u2026</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you beseech again, reaching out to take a hold of his wrist and drag his touch closer to where you so desperately need it only to have your hand slapped away, groaning in frustration when he removes himself from you. \u00a0It\u2019s his cocked eyebrow that you see first as he emerges from between your legs and stands to full height - his smirking mouth shortly after, slick with your essence.</p><p>He tuts loudly as he leans over you, one hand on the table and the other pinning your wrist by your side. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you always this impatient?\u201d he questions, cocking his head as he looks down at you. \u00a0\u00a0His bangs fall in front of his eyes, the rest of his hair slightly dishevelled from how often you\u2019ve run your fingers through it. \u00a0You bite your lip and glance away, cheeks red from his teasing chastisement. \u201cWell?\u201d he persists, squeezing at your wrist, \u201cAre you?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cM-maybe,\u201d you admit, willfully understating the size of your sexual appetite. \u00a0Ever since Jimin introduced to life\u2019s more carnal delights you\u2019ve hardly been able to get your fill; insatiable since the moment you met. \u00a0Would you be like this with any other lover, you wonder, or is it his influence and the company you keep that made you this way?</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019ve been spoiled.\u201d \u00a0Jin lets go of your wrist, his smile growing at the needful groan you release at the sliding of his palm along the inside of your thigh and your whine of discontent when he steals it away. \u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in always getting what you want right away?\u201d Again he brushes his fingertips against you; a brief passing of his index finger against your swollen clitoris. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find the rewards far more satisfying when you\u2019ve really had to work for them, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Desperately trying to ignore the fierce ache deep down within your abdomen, you sit up and lean back on your elbows, face flushed and bottom lip bitten as you ask,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d \u00a0Frankly, you\u2019re willing to do anything if it means Jin will actually<i> touch</i> you rather than torment you with the slow circles he\u2019s drawing in the wetness smeared across the tops of your thighs. \u00a0</p><p>Jin smiles, pleased, and then leans in to press a chaste kiss to your lips. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what you want\u2026 and just how much you want it,\u201d he breathes into your ear, soft and seductive, \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I want you,\u201d you begin, stating the obvious as Jin begins to smatter your skin in lingering kisses, your cheeks blazing with heat underneath the press of his lips. \u00a0\u201cWant you to fuck me, so bad.\u201d Another kiss to the slant of your jaw, your head tipping back.</p><p>Considering how imagining Jin in any kind of sexual context had made you blush so hotly, you can barely believe how carelessly you\u2019ve begun to speak. \u00a0With every centimetre his fingertips creep closer to your core the more shameless you become, barely even registering the garbled, filthy words that are falling from your mouth. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNeed your cock, Seokjin, please.\u201d \u00a0You make a grab for the front of his shirt where it remains hanging open, tugging on it for emphasis. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was it my fingers you wanted a second ago. \u00a0Which is it?\u201d he presses in that same teasing tone as before, sliding them slowly from top to bottom of your labia and then back up again. \u201cMake up your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything!\u201d you very nearly shout as he pinches at your clit, the sting of it so strong that it has you slumping from your elbows onto your back, skin slapping against the table. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnything,\u201d you repeat, softer, a lump forming in your throat as frustration threatens to overwhelm you completely - so tightly wound that your legs are beginning to tremble from wanting alone.</p><p>Closing your eyes in an attempt to calm yourself, you turn your head to the side to find Jin\u2019s hand waiting for you there. \u00a0He tenderly cradles your cheek in your palm as he kisses the other, the feel of his chest pressed to yours heavy and yet comforting in its coolness; a soothing balm against your fevered skin. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he praises, nuzzling you affectionately. \u00a0\u201cWanna be nice and tight for me, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Weakly, you nod, your breath hitching when you feel Jin reach between bodies and hear the rustling of fabric as he pushes his bottoms further down. \u00a0Soon enough, his blunt girth is pressing between your legs, hot and impatient, and you let your legs flop open wider as he begins to tease the weeping head back and forth amongst your wetness, lubricating himself. \u00a0</p><p>You know it\u2019ll be a stretch without Jin having eased you open first - you\u2019ve felt how thick he is first hand, after all - but by this point, you\u2019re well past caring. \u00a0You\u2019ll happily accommodate anything he\u2019s willing to give so long as it finally means you\u2019ll be granted some relief.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019ve got such a sweet little cunt,\u201d he grunts before seizing your mouth with his, releasing your face to grab at your hips and pull you right to the edge of the table so he can better angle himself to enter you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeokjin, <i>please</i>,\u201d you plead as he pushes barely an inch inside, waiting until the stretch has you tense and gasping before pulling back again \u00a0You\u2019re sure he\u2019s tormenting himself just as much as he is you; you can feel how taut his shoulders are as you slip your hands inside his shirt to grab at them, wrapping your legs around his waist. \u00a0</p><p>Jin silences you with kisses, consuming the moans you make as he shallowly dips the tip in and out of you again and again and again till it there\u2019s no longer any pain. \u00a0You\u2019re so ready by the time he\u2019s done that if he rocked his hips even just the slightest bit harder you know he\u2019d slip straight inside and as he stills once more, so tantalisingly close, you\u2019re praying he\u2019ll do just that.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me again,\u201d Jin mumbles against your lips. \u00a0You\u2019re caught off guard by the hint of vulnerability that you detect, but given all he\u2019s been through today it should really come as no surprise that he\u2019s craving reassurance that he\u2019s still needed - still loved even if it\u2019s not quite in the same way.</p><p>You kiss him, sweetly, and lift your forehead to press it to his. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you, Seokjin. \u00a0I want this, want you.\u201d \u00a0You feel Jin nod and see the furrow in his brow right before he kisses you again, forcing your eyes closed. \u00a0His hips tilt and your rise up to meet him, guiding him effortlessly into place, and with his lips moulded to yours, Jin starts to slowly push inside. \u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s such a snug fit that the feeling of his cock breaching you has the of you both panting for air before he\u2019s even fully seated inside. \u00a0Jin doesn\u2019t hesitate or falter, though, not stopping until his pelvis is sat flush with yours and a simple squeeze of your inner muscles has him gasping and digging his fingertips into the flesh of your thigh, his eyes screwed shut tight. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shibal</i>, I\u2019d forgotten how good this feels,\u201d Jin groans as he starts to move, smooth pushes and pulls that are neither too fast nor too slow. \u00a0\u201cSo warm.\u201d Jin cups your breast in his palm, kneading it firmly as he moves within you until a particular firm thrust has your whole body shifting, the table groaning beneath you with the force of it. \u00a0Wetness squelches around his cock as he does it again, grinning as you gasp and grab at his shoulders. \u201cSo fucking wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh g-god, Jin,\u201d you moan, clenching your thighs tighter around his waist, willing him not to stop. \u00a0You\u2019ve been waiting so long for this that you know it won\u2019t take long for you to cum. You can feel it building even now; the subtle curve of Jin\u2019s cock perfectly shaped to press against your g-spot with each and every thrust. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re squeezing so tight, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0Jin leans closer, closing the gap between your bodies so each rock of his hips has your breasts bouncing and his solid chest crashing into yours, \u00a0His mouth is on your neck, his breaths short and shallow against your skin. \u201cNo wonder the others can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>You whine mindlessly, so deliciously close that your toes are already starting to curl. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-harder, please,\u201d you pant breathlessly, digging your fingers into his hair and pushing him further into the crook of your neck. \u00a0You feel the lightest graze of his fangs against your throat and your whole pelvis clenches in response, your body well trained to anticipate the euphoria that being fed upon brings. \u00a0\u201cSeokjin, I\u2026 God, I\u2019m so close, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he smirks, lifting his head, \u201cYou like it a little rougher, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u00a0With his next thrust, Jin\u2019s hips come smacking savagely into yours, barely giving you any time to even catch your breath before he\u2019s pulling back and then slamming in again, lifting his chest off of yours and grabbing hold of your hips, towering over you. \u00a0</p><p>Try as he might, there\u2019s something about the position you\u2019re in that doesn\u2019t allow Jin to take you as fast as he would like. \u00a0Perhaps the table\u2019s too low or it\u2019s just not sturdy enough, but it feels like mere seconds before he\u2019s groaning with frustration and pulling out of you. \u00a0He grabs your hand, ignoring your questioning look.</p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d he demands, pulling you to your feet and clutching you to him, weakening your knees when he slips one hand between your legs and immediately slides two fingers inside. \u00a0You can hear every curl of his fingers as every knuckle becomes coated with your wetness, and as he kisses the breath out of you it\u2019s all you can do to clutch onto his shirt to stay upright. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve done this sooner,\u201d Jin tells you through gritted teeth, his free hand digging tightly into your waist, his cock weeping against your hip while you fall to pieces around his fingers. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever get sick of such a pretty cunt as yours.\u201d</p><p>Almost as though he can sense how close you are to the precipice, Jin withdraws his digits from you and your eyes open, your whole body trembling with the injustice of it. \u00a0You can barely keep yourself upright but Jin seems unconcerned, busy yanking off his shirt and tossing it to the ground to reveal his naked physique in all its glory.</p><p>\u201cBend over,\u201d he instructs, dragging to towards the counter and then releasing your arm only to push at your back, forcing you to bend from the waist and lift your rear into the air, clutching the edge. \u00a0\u201cYou wanted it harder, right, sweetheart?\u201d He bends right over you, his sticky chest flush to your back. \u201cBetter hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly straightens, the sound of his deep inhale the only warning that you get before Jin impales you on the length of his cock. \u00a0He drags you back by the hips as he thrusts forward just as hard, the bones of his pelvis slamming into the flesh of your buttocks. Relentless, Jin has you wailing as he takes you just as roughly as he promised, driving into you again and again. \u00a0Each snap is so savage that you\u2019re certain you\u2019ll have bruises once he\u2019s through but it\u2019s not as though you care.</p><p>You\u2019re finally getting what you wanted - about to cum so hard you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll even be able to remember your name once he\u2019s through. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSuch a good girl,\u201d Jin praises, out of breath with exertion, \u201cMade for taking our cocks, weren\u2019t you? \u00a0Such a good little plaything for her masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d you sob in reply, your cheek pressed to the counter as Jin\u2019s fingers find their way into your hair and he tugs at the roots, \u201cGod, <i>yes!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me how hard you can cum, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0He tightens his grip, pushing your cheek harder into the countertop, \u201c<i>Show me</i>.\u201d \u00a0And you do - spectacularly. \u00a0</p><p>The pleasure that rips through you is so intense that you have to press your face to the hard surface to muffle the cries that burst forth from your lungs, and your hands shake as you desperately cling to the counter because Jin doesn\u2019t let up. \u00a0All the while you keen and curse he continues to drive into you, fucking you through your orgasm and out to the other side.</p><p>\u201cJin, <i>please</i>,\u201d you gasp, but now it\u2019s mercy for which you beg. \u00a0It\u2019s too much when he reaches between your legs and starts to rub at your clit, so overwhelming that you\u2019re having to bite your bottom lip to keep from crying out. \u201cI c-ca-can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>At your protest Jin steps back, a growl rumbling from his chest as he grabs at your limbs from behind. \u00a0Like a ragdoll he manhandles you, pulling you up straight and spinning you round to face him and then surging forward to slam his lips into yours. \u00a0With his fingertips digging into your upper arms he walks you back until you hit something hard and cold; pleasant against your heated skin. It\u2019s only when he\u2019s picked you up and resumed such a vigorous pace that you hear the jars inside rattling with every thrust that you even realise it\u2019s the refrigerator he\u2019s fucking you against.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure\u2026 you want me to stop?\u201d \u00a0Jin\u2019s voice is wrecked from where he speaks down into the crook of your neck, his arms wrapped as tightly around your waist as yours are around his hips, your buttocks in his palms. \u201cYour cunt says otherwise.\u201d \u00a0He lifts his head and smashes his lips into yours, all teeth and tongues as his thrusts drive deep, biting out his words. \u201cI can feel you squeezing around my cock again already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-fuck,\u201d you choke into his kiss, your fingernails raking lines of red across into the shoulder blades to which you cling. \u00a0You\u2019re so drunk on oxytocin that you can barely string two words together - so high on lingering endorphins that your body feels as though it should sing - and you don\u2019t ever want this feeling to stop. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeen so good to me tonight,\u201d he huffs, visibly beginning to tire from the ruthlessness of his efforts in spite of the supernatural stamina he\u2019s blessed with. \u201cDo you think you can cum with me, sweetheart? \u00a0Show me -\u201d Jin has to pause mid-sentence to catch his breath, his eyes pressing closed at the feel of your walls closing in around him, pushing towards his release. \u201c - show me how much you love my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cK-keep going and\u2026 and I will,\u201d you promise, just as breathless. \u00a0</p><p>Your hand are in Jin\u2019s hair when he suddenly changes pace. \u00a0His thrusts slow and each time he pulls back it\u2019s barely even halfway, yet somehow it feels even better than before. \u00a0Now, instead of filthy, frantic rutting, it\u2019s a deep, dirty grind that has his pubic bone grinding against your clit like a pestle and mortar with every circle of his hips, the head of his cock brushing your sweetest spot over and over again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>S-seokjin</i>\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d you warn, digging your fingers into his scalp. \u00a0He groans in acknowledgement, his breath heavy in your ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2026 w-where do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d you answer without thought, your head falling back as the tide of pleasure begins to rise. \u00a0\u201cCum inside me, Jin. Oh <i>god</i>, I wanna feel you cum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Jin shouts, grabbing your ass so hard that it hurts. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s the slowest and deepest thrusts of all that finally push you both over the edge; each one dragged out as though he\u2019s trying to savour this last few precious seconds before it ends. \u00a0He\u2019s surprisingly quiet as he cums considering how vocal he\u2019s been so far but you can still feel how greatly he\u2019s affected. His cock pulses and twitches long after he\u2019s spilt every drop and it\u2019s started to drip down the inside of your thighs - his whole body trembling and his breaths similarly shuddering. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJin.\u201d \u00a0You utter his name ever so softly after a minute or so has passed where neither of you has moved nor said a word. \u00a0He has his forehead rested to yours, his eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks at the feel of you gently carding your fingers through his hair. \u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Part of you is worried that now the heat of the moment has passed Jin\u2019s mood might suddenly crash - that he might suddenly be overcome with guilt or regret everything that\u2019s just happened. \u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, when he opens his eyes and meets your gaze his smile may be small and somewhat lopsided, but at least it looks genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d \u00a0He begins the somewhat messy task of separating the two of you, adding, \u201cPromise,\u2019 when he sees the way you\u2019re searching his expression to see if anything looks amiss. \u00a0</p><p>Jin\u2019s nothing but attentive as he settles your feet back on the floor and waits until you\u2019re steady before leaving your side to collect the clothes that are strewn about the place. \u00a0He grins sheepishly as he comes back and sees you reaching for the roll of paper towels by the sink, thighs clenched together to avoid dripping onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he apologises as you wipe yourself clean with a grimace, wrinkling your nose at the scratchiness of the paper against your extra-sensitive parts. \u00a0\u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve picked a more practical location.\u201d Jin grins as you laugh, pulling on the clothes that he hands to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure there was enough forward planning involved for that\u2026.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he laughs along, pulling up his pants and then shrugging on his shirt. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t bother doing it up, though, just leaves it hanging open as he steps towards you with his hands outstretched. \u00a0Cupping your cheeks, Jin dips his head to kiss you.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d \u00a0His voice is tight with emotion as he says it, not yet pulling away. \u201cI think I needed that.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u201d you answer easily, slipping your hands under his shirt to press your palms to the flat of his back, gently caressing. You\u2019re relieved to feel how relaxed his muscles are beneath your hands - how slow and steady his breathing is. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t too rough?\u201d \u00a0You smile as Jin straightens up, his expression mildly embarrassed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNever too rough,\u201d you assure him, your tone turning playful after as you add, \u201cSo\u2026 my \u2018masters\u2019, eh?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Jin laughs heartily, taking a step back and rubbing awkwardly at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou caught that, huh?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d you giggle, leaning back against the edge of the counter and folding your arms. \u201cMost definitely.\u201d \u00a0<br>\u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018daddy\u2019 is much better, is it?\u201d he teases, and as he finally starts to button up his shirt you snort out a laugh, smiling broadly. \u00a0He has a point, you suppose.</p><p>Jin begins to clear up while you remain basking in the afterglow a little longer, propped up against the counter as you wait for some strength to return to your jellified legs. \u00a0He hums as he collects all the bottles and glasses from the table and deposits them into the sink to wash another time, and you\u2019re glad he seems as though he\u2019s in a better mood now than the state in which you found him, even if it may only be temporary.</p><p>\u201cI still think you should talk to Soo-Mi, you know,\u201d you say after a little while, coming to stand at his side. \u00a0Jin frowns at the remnants of the wine he\u2019s pouring down the drain, and at the sight of his furrowed brow you place a soothing hand in the small of his back, kneading through his shirt. \u00a0\u201cObviously it\u2019s your call, but I think it\u2019d be a shame to just let things go after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d He shrugs non committedly, sighing as he places the bottle down on the side to dry. \u00a0Turning around, he very gently passes his thumb across your cheek, smiling as you lean into it. \u00a0\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, \u201cWe should get you to bed. I\u2019ve kept you up long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming with, then?\u201d you chuckle when Jin offers you his hand, slipping your fingers between his without hesitation. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it, but I could hardly call myself a gentleman if I didn\u2019t at least walk you to your door, could I?\u201d \u00a0Well, you can hardly argue with that.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for you to arrive at Jimin\u2019s door. \u00a0Rather than let you go once you get there, however, Jin turns to you and takes your left hand as well, his expression earnest. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you again, for tonight,\u201d he says, squeezing your hands good and tight. \u00a0\u201cI really enjoyed it and\u2026 I hope you did too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d you smile, squeezing back. \u00a0Could there really be any doubt?</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d he grins, his normal bravado swiftly re-emerging now he\u2019s been suitably reassured. \u00a0\u201cGoodnight then, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight Jinnie.\u201d \u00a0You kiss him goodnight on your tiptoes and after one final squeeze of his hands, you disentangle your fingers from his and head into Jimin\u2019s room, grinning at the kiss he blows your way just the door presses shut. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re almost pleased to find that Jimin and Yoongi aren\u2019t home yet, your bed empty save where Nova is curled up in a ball on Yoongi\u2019s pillow. \u00a0It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not looking forward to seeing them, more that you know that if they were there waiting to beckon you under the duvet you wouldn\u2019t have the willpower to resist joining them despite the shower you so desperately need. \u00a0</p><p>You head to the bathroom without delay, stripping out of the clothes you\u2019ve only just recently put back on along the way. \u00a0The water\u2019s blissfully warm and it feels amazing against the soreness Jin left behind. You\u2019re so absorbed enjoying the heat of it seeping into your limbs, in fact, that you don\u2019t even realise you\u2019re no longer alone in the bathroom until the cubicle door opens and you feel hands upon your hips - lips brushing the back of your neck. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d already be in bed.\u201d \u00a0The familiar sound of Yoongi\u2019s low, gravelly voice relaxes you instantly and you lean back against his chest, releasing a contented hum when his lithe arms wrap around your waist. \u00a0\u201cJimin shouldn\u2019t be long. He\u2019s just speaking to Hoseok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, good,\u201d you sigh, luxuriating in the slow, soothing kisses he\u2019s trailing along the length of your neck. \u00a0\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d \u00a0You smile at Yoongi\u2019s self-assuredness, placing your hands on top of his to stop them from drifting up to fondle your breasts as you know he\u2019d been intending. \u00a0Your nipples are still far too sensitive for that thanks to all Jin\u2019s pinching and tweaking. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d he admits with a chuckle when you nudge him in the ribs with your elbow. \u00a0\u201cSo\u2026 why are you up so late?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly you\u2019re beset by a rush of nerves, mouth hanging open as you search for the courage it takes to reply. \u00a0You know that you need to tell Jimin and Yoongi about what\u2019s just happened with Jin, and you know that you all agreed to be honest with one another and that permission was no longer required but\u2026 what if the reality of it turns out to be more than they\u2019re able to bear? \u00a0What if Jimin changes his mind?</p><p>\u201cJin and Soo-Mi broke up,\u201d you begin, fiddling with fingers nervously where they rest upon your stomach, \u201cAnd he was\u2026 a little bit of a mess when I got home. \u00a0Found him in the kitchen busy drinking his own body weight in booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrowning his sorrows, hm? \u00a0Always a good plan,\u201d Yoongi muses dryly, and when you turn around in his arms, wet chest to wet chest, you see the slightest of smiles tugging at his lips. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing you helped him feel better, hm?\u201d \u00a0There\u2019s something about the way one of Yoongi\u2019s eyebrows rises and the slightly playful tone to his voice that has you blushing and glancing at your feet. Before you can say anything more or start to ramble your excuses, \u00a0Yoongi graces you with a gentle kiss, soothing your anxieties. \u201cI could smell him on your clothes, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d \u00a0You hesitate as the dark-haired vampire releases you and reaches for the shampoo, lathering up his hair. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not mad, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? \u00a0No.\u201d He prises one eye open to peek at you, foamy suds dripping down his forehead. \u00a0\u201cIf it helped then I\u2019m glad, as long as he treated you right. It\u2019s been a long time since <i>hyung </i>got laid\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d you confirm, pressing your body to his to sneak back under the water regardless of the risk of getting wayward shampoo splashes in your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Yoongi replies once all the remaining shampoo is gone and he\u2019s passed his hands over his face, wiping the water out of his eyes. \u00a0Leaning past him, you take the shampoo for yourself, squirting a generous amount into your palm.</p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2026\u201d You glance at Yoongi who\u2019s listening attentively, his gaze straying only momentarily when your arms extend above your head and your chest bounces with the motion. \u00a0\u201cDo you think Jimin will mind\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Yoongi answers quickly, \u201cAnd if he does then just leave him to me.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You have to admit, it\u2019s more than a little reassuring to know that Yoongi\u2019s got your back should Jimin decide to become jealous despite everything you agreed. \u00a0Although Jimin may take the lead in the bedroom, you know that he respects the elder vampire greatly as his <i>hyung. \u00a0</i>Calm and collected, you\u2019ve seen how Yoongi\u2019s cool temper helps douse Jimin\u2019s natural fire, though in this case you really hope it won\u2019t be necessary. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere, let me,\u201d Yoongi beckons, hands on your waist to turn you around so that your back is facing him and he\u2019s able to take over washing your hair, his long fingers like heaven as they massage at your scalp. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you say softly, biting back a moan as he rubs firmly at your temples. \u00a0You don\u2019t just mean for the head rub, and you hope Yoongi realises that.</p><p>\u201cAnytime princess.\u201d \u00a0The two of you fall silent for a while after that, and as Yoongi replaces the shampoo in your hair with conditioner, combing it through, it takes every bit of willpower you possess not to fall asleep while you\u2019re leant against him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he suddenly exclaims causing you to very nearly jump out of your skin, head swinging round to look over your shoulder with wide and startled eyes. \u00a0\u201cI bet that bastard drank all my Barolo, didn\u2019t he?!\u201d</p>",

His thumbs drag across your stiff nipples, and very slow circle that passes over them has your innards clenching with excitement - your lip bitten to withhold all the gasps that threaten to part them. \u00a0</p><p>You watch, insides quivering, as Jin\u2019s pillow soft lips pass over every inch of your stomach in a series of slow, lingering kisses. \u00a0With his eyes closed he looks so serene; so handsome that it steals your breath away when he opens them and gazes up into yours.</p><p>In an almost trance-like state, you take off your top and let it fall carelessly to the floor so that Jin can take immediate advantage of your newly exposed skin. \u00a0His kisses turn into wet flicks and licks of his tongue along your breastbone, all the way up till his face is nestled in your cleavage. He turns his head to the side to kiss the swell of your breast with a hum that sounds almost wistful; longing..</p><p>Threading your fingers gently through his hair, Jin is easily persuaded to turn his mouth\u2019s attention towards your nipple. \u00a0A soft sigh escapes as you as he encases it with his lips, teasing your areola with the tip of his tongue whilst his thumb works the other, your back arching to press your breasts further into his eager hands. \u00a0</p><p>The pleasure may feel exquisite but it\u2019s almost more than you can bear. \u00a0Your body is more than ready and willing to receive him after having already brought Jin to a climax; each touch incensing you further, panting so hard that you\u2019re light-headed with desire. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJin,\u201d you utter quietly, pushing his hair back to better see his face. \u00a0His strong jaw moves with every motion of his tongue as he sucks and licks and laps at you, a light crease of concentration etched into his brow as he works. \u00a0\u201cSeokjin,\u201d you say again when he doesn\u2019t respond, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>His eyes open as he lets your spit-slick nipple fall from his mouth, the corners of it cocked into a smirk. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to savour you, sweetheart,\u201d he tells you, placing another soft kiss to the space just above your navel. \u201cPatience.\u201d \u00a0Eyes closing once more, Jin\u2019s mouth begins to work lower as his hands do the same, skimming over your lower back and buttocks while his lips trace the waistband of your bottoms, infuriatingly slow.</p><p>You\u2019re about to start pleading again when Jin suddenly gropes your behind with both hands, squeezing. \u00a0He pushes his face right between your legs and inhales, the sound of it nothing short of obscene.</p><p>\u201cJin!\u201d you gasp as heat floods into your cheeks, scandalised by his unexpectedly brazen behaviour. \u00a0Despite you pushing at his head and squeezing your thighs together to try to discourage him all this does is make Jin laugh and nuzzle further into you, and when he finally does withdraw it\u2019s not without knocking the tip of his nose right into your clit to weaken your knees, first. \u00a0</p><p>He rests his cheek against your stomach and smiles sweetly up at you, watching the way you squirm from the confusing mixture of embarrassment and arousal that\u2019s coursing through you.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t get just how intoxicating your scent is, do you?\u201d Jin asks, and despite the teasing glimmer in his eyes, his words sound sincere. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to gorge myself between these thighs more times than I can count.\u201d You gasp as Jin\u2019s hands slip further down from your buttocks to the backs of your thighs, his fingertips mere inches away from brushing your core. \u00a0</p><p>Your cheeks redden further, knowing Jin must be able to feel how sopping wet you are through the barrier of your thin clothes. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially</i> when you\u2019re menstruating,\u201d he continues, eyes closing as if experiencing some sort of tortured bliss at the mere thought of it. \u201c<i>God</i>. \u00a0You\u2019ve no fucking clue.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>When you\u2026 w-when\u2026</p><p>Your body that had been practically buzzing with excitement suddenly falls still, your stomach dropping unpleasantly. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re not sure why it comes as such a shock, really, to have Jin mention it. \u00a0When you\u2019d first moved into the mansion Jimin had warned you that it would likely be best to avoid the other vampires within the house at certain points of your cycle and to begin with. you\u2019d presumed this was purely for your safety - too much blood flowing freely was bound to be a temptation, after all. \u00a0As time had gone on, though, and you\u2019d experienced your first period in Jimin\u2019s presence and witnessed just how insatiable he\u2019d become - in more ways than one - you began to understand that it might\u2019ve been for an entirely different purpose he\u2019d advised you to hide away.</p><p>True, it\u2019d taken you a while to get over your own squeamishness about that particular method of feeding. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t think of much else more disgusting, quite frankly, but later on, after having seen how Yoongi was similarly enthusiastic about it, you\u2019d been able to let go, happy that you were able to provide your lovers such nourishment.</p><p>You\u2019d gotten the feeling the vampires had made an effort to avoid you during those times, too, but you\u2019d always presumed it was Jimin who\u2019d warned them away rather than them having a direct awareness of it. \u00a0To find out that Jin has been able to smell it every single month is\u2026 a little mortifying to say the least.</p><p>\u201cY-you can\u2026?\u201d \u00a0Jin\u2019s smile broadens, his palms rubbing soothingly down the backs of your legs and slipping beneath the hem of your bottoms on their way back up. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, sweetheart,\u201d he teases, \u201cThere aren\u2019t walls thick enough that\u2019d keep the scent of you away.\u201d \u00a0You bite your lip, legs quaking as his fingertips feather across the space where your thighs end and the curve of your buttocks begins. It\u2019s only when you neglect to say anything more that Jin seems to realise how awkward about it you feel. \u00a0\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be embarrassed,\u201d he encourages, pausing to place a gentle kiss to your abdomen. \u201cMaybe Jungkook or some of the others might shy away from it, but the more mature of us - the more experienced - know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve tried it, then?\u201d To be honest, you\u2019d always presumed that Jin\u2019s experience of real physical intimacy with women had come to an abrupt and complete end the very moment he\u2019d been turned. \u00a0Apparently, you\u2019d thought wrong.</p><p>Jin huffs a wry laugh, his smile no longer quite meeting his eyes the way it had before. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNamjoon and I shared many experiences just after we were first turned\u2026 and well, let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve been one to turn down a free meal.\u201d \u00a0You feel your eyes widen almost comically at the mention of Namjoon\u2019s name, but thankfully Jin is too busy kissing your stomach to notice that his words have given you pause. \u00a0</p><p>When he says \u2018shared\u2019, does that mean\u2026? \u00a0Before tonight you never in your wildest dreams would\u2019ve thought that Jin and Namjoon would harbour similar sexual appetites. \u00a0In your mind, the two of them couldn\u2019t be more like chalk and cheese, but it sounds as though the eldest vampire likes to be a little more savage between the sheets than you\u2019d originally expected\u2026. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a proper look at you, sweetheart,\u201d you hear Jin mumble as he hooks his thumbs into the waistband of your bottoms, distracting you from your thoughts. \u00a0He slowly inches them down, and you try not to blush once they pass over the thickest part of your thighs and then fall to the floor, taking a thick, glossy strand of your arousal with them. \u00a0</p><p>He parts your labia with his thumbs and smiles at the sight of your engorged clit, his touch all too fleeting. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he decides, and quicker than you can blink Jin suddenly stands and lifts you, gasping, off of your feet, placing you right back down on the cold surface of the dining table. \u00a0Lying you down, he grins wolfishly at the way you shudder and takes a moment to stand at the edge of the table, unbuttoning his shirt as he surveys you laid out beneath him.</p><p>\u201cFunny isn\u2019t it,\u201d Jin begins once his shirt hangs open to expose the subtle musculature of his chest, \u201cThat you\u2019re the only meal this table will have ever seen.\u201d \u00a0You can\u2019t seem to muster a reply, too focused on remembering to breathe as Jin nonchalantly reaches into your glass tumbler and retrieves a remaining cube of ice. Grasped between his thumb and forefinger, he shows it to you before popping it into his mouth. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cW-what are you-?\u201d you begin as he leans over you, your sentence cut short by the freezing cold kiss he presses between your cleavage and the strangled sound that bursts forth from your lungs. \u00a0Jin\u2019s hands are rested on each of your thighs as his mouth wanders, the ice held between his puckered lips to drag it directly across your skin as you try to keep your body from flinching underneath him, instinct causing you to try and wriggle away from the unfamiliar sensation. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d \u00a0The exclamation escapes you before you can hold it back as Jin diverts from the trail of icy water he\u2019s smeared between your breasts and turns his attention to your nipples.. \u00a0\u201cHoly s-shit, that\u2019s cold\u2026\u201d When his eyes open they\u2019re full of devilish delight, watching the way your eyebrows furrow and you bite your lip as he slowly rubs the ice slowly back and forth over the painfully hardened peak. \u00a0</p><p>Under his loving assault, your sensitive flesh flushes from pink to red - numb with cold and yet somehow tingling and throbbing all at once - and god, you love the way it feels. \u00a0Your fingers flex, fingernails pressing into the surface of the table for purchase as Jin reaches for another piece of ice and begins to rub that one into your other nipple to make you gasp and bow all over again.</p><p>Slowly, each cube begins to melt, and your body shudders as tiny droplets of icy water dribble down the sides of your breasts. \u00a0Jin swallows the remains of what\u2019s left in his mouth but his kiss remains just as cold even without the ice caught between his teeth, goosebumps rising along your skin as he abandons your breasts in favour of trailing his lips down your stomach.</p><p>\u201cOne more, I think.\u201d \u00a0Tipping your chin forward, you see Jin pluck another ice cube from his glass. \u00a0He glances at you, smiling, as he pops it in his mouth and then leans over you and deposits it directly into the dip of your belly-button, chuckling when your whole body jolts underneath him. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so responsive, sweetheart,\u201d he admires as you pant and shiver, willing the ice to melt as fast as possible as you stare down at it. With the way Jin has you burning up, surely it shouldn\u2019t take long? \u00a0\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>His kiss travels lower as his hands caress your thighs, and you find yourself holding your breath in anticipation as Jin drops into a deep squat and pushes gently at your knees, spreading you open. \u00a0You feel the softness of Jin\u2019s mouth press kisses into the inside of your thighs, from one side to the other as they climb ever higher and higher, closer to your core.</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, ok?\u201d you hear him say, and you can feel each word right between your legs, close enough to feel his breath. \u201cLet me know if I\u2019m not meeting your expectations,\u201d he adds. \u00a0The smile you can hear in his voice helps to make you relax, unwinding the tightness in your shoulders as you smile up at the ceiling, biting your lip to withhold a giggle.</p><p>Trust him to try and make you laugh at a time like this. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Jin\u2019s lips are so breathtakingly cold that the first touch them makes your whole body jump on contact, falling still only once he\u2019s taken hold of your hips to hold you in place to better trace every inch of your anatomy with his tongue. \u00a0You wish he\u2019d done it sooner; by moving so sharply you\u2019d managed to make the small amount of melted water in your navel spill over, and now you\u2019re driven to distraction by the feel of it dribbling slowly down your side, tickling as it goes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d you groan as he steals your attention back with a firm swipe against your clitoris, top to bottom and then side to side, wriggling figures of eight into tight little nub as his head tilts from side to side, his nose pressed close to your pubic mound. \u00a0With every flick the most gorgeous jolts of pleasure ascend your spine, fogging your brain till you\u2019re completely lost to anything else than the sensations between your legs.</p><p>His hair is soft when you reach down and thread your fingers through it - the finest of silks - and when you gently tug on it in encouragement, willing him to delve deeper, Jin is quick to oblige. \u00a0He hums in acknowledgement of your wishes, briefly opening his eyes to look up into yours as his licks turn into open mouth kisses that descend until his pouted lips are pressed directly to your entrance. \u00a0</p><p>Diligently, he begins to feast. \u00a0Jin lets no drop of your arousal go to waste, adding to it with the saliva that he licks into your pussy, the tip of his tongue dipping inside you as his nose rubs against your clit. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeokjin.\u201d \u00a0He gives no sign that he\u2019s heard your wanton moan save the tightening of his grip around your hips, far too absorbed in enjoying the task at hand to want to waste even a single second. \u00a0\u201cJin,\u201d you mewl, twisting in his hold as he returns to your clit and sucks it sharply between his lips. You\u2019re too far gone to care about the water spilling from your navel every time you shift on the table\u2019s surface, unconcerned with the fresh wave of goosebumps it summons across your skin. \u00a0\u201cYour fingers, p-please\u2026\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve done this enough times now to know that you struggle to find with clitoral stimulation alone; aching for that feeling of fullness inside. \u00a0All you want is for him to slip the digits that are now sliding from your hip and down your thigh inside of you, and your hips flex up from the table as though chasing after them as he unhurriedly draws them upward again, tickling. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re about reaching the limits of this \u2018patience\u2019 that Jin mentioned\u2026</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you beseech again, reaching out to take a hold of his wrist and drag his touch closer to where you so desperately need it only to have your hand slapped away, groaning in frustration when he removes himself from you. \u00a0It\u2019s his cocked eyebrow that you see first as he emerges from between your legs and stands to full height - his smirking mouth shortly after, slick with your essence.</p><p>He tuts loudly as he leans over you, one hand on the table and the other pinning your wrist by your side. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you always this impatient?\u201d he questions, cocking his head as he looks down at you. \u00a0\u00a0His bangs fall in front of his eyes, the rest of his hair slightly dishevelled from how often you\u2019ve run your fingers through it. \u00a0You bite your lip and glance away, cheeks red from his teasing chastisement. \u201cWell?\u201d he persists, squeezing at your wrist, \u201cAre you?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cM-maybe,\u201d you admit, willfully understating the size of your sexual appetite. \u00a0Ever since Jimin introduced to life\u2019s more carnal delights you\u2019ve hardly been able to get your fill; insatiable since the moment you met. \u00a0Would you be like this with any other lover, you wonder, or is it his influence and the company you keep that made you this way?</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019ve been spoiled.\u201d \u00a0Jin lets go of your wrist, his smile growing at the needful groan you release at the sliding of his palm along the inside of your thigh and your whine of discontent when he steals it away. \u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in always getting what you want right away?\u201d Again he brushes his fingertips against you; a brief passing of his index finger against your swollen clitoris. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find the rewards far more satisfying when you\u2019ve really had to work for them, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Desperately trying to ignore the fierce ache deep down within your abdomen, you sit up and lean back on your elbows, face flushed and bottom lip bitten as you ask,</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d \u00a0Frankly, you\u2019re willing to do anything if it means Jin will actually<i> touch</i> you rather than torment you with the slow circles he\u2019s drawing in the wetness smeared across the tops of your thighs. \u00a0</p><p>Jin smiles, pleased, and then leans in to press a chaste kiss to your lips. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what you want\u2026 and just how much you want it,\u201d he breathes into your ear, soft and seductive, \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I want you,\u201d you begin, stating the obvious as Jin begins to smatter your skin in lingering kisses, your cheeks blazing with heat underneath the press of his lips. \u00a0\u201cWant you to fuck me, so bad.\u201d Another kiss to the slant of your jaw, your head tipping back.</p><p>Considering how imagining Jin in any kind of sexual context had made you blush so hotly, you can barely believe how carelessly you\u2019ve begun to speak. \u00a0With every centimetre his fingertips creep closer to your core the more shameless you become, barely even registering the garbled, filthy words that are falling from your mouth. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNeed your cock, Seokjin, please.\u201d \u00a0You make a grab for the front of his shirt where it remains hanging open, tugging on it for emphasis. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was it my fingers you wanted a second ago. \u00a0Which is it?\u201d he presses in that same teasing tone as before, sliding them slowly from top to bottom of your labia and then back up again. \u201cMake up your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything!\u201d you very nearly shout as he pinches at your clit, the sting of it so strong that it has you slumping from your elbows onto your back, skin slapping against the table. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnything,\u201d you repeat, softer, a lump forming in your throat as frustration threatens to overwhelm you completely - so tightly wound that your legs are beginning to tremble from wanting alone.</p><p>Closing your eyes in an attempt to calm yourself, you turn your head to the side to find Jin\u2019s hand waiting for you there. \u00a0He tenderly cradles your cheek in your palm as he kisses the other, the feel of his chest pressed to yours heavy and yet comforting in its coolness; a soothing balm against your fevered skin. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he praises, nuzzling you affectionately. \u00a0\u201cWanna be nice and tight for me, is that it?\u201d</p><p>Weakly, you nod, your breath hitching when you feel Jin reach between bodies and hear the rustling of fabric as he pushes his bottoms further down. \u00a0Soon enough, his blunt girth is pressing between your legs, hot and impatient, and you let your legs flop open wider as he begins to tease the weeping head back and forth amongst your wetness, lubricating himself. \u00a0</p><p>You know it\u2019ll be a stretch without Jin having eased you open first - you\u2019ve felt how thick he is first hand, after all - but by this point, you\u2019re well past caring. \u00a0You\u2019ll happily accommodate anything he\u2019s willing to give so long as it finally means you\u2019ll be granted some relief.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019ve got such a sweet little cunt,\u201d he grunts before seizing your mouth with his, releasing your face to grab at your hips and pull you right to the edge of the table so he can better angle himself to enter you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeokjin, <i>please</i>,\u201d you plead as he pushes barely an inch inside, waiting until the stretch has you tense and gasping before pulling back again \u00a0You\u2019re sure he\u2019s tormenting himself just as much as he is you; you can feel how taut his shoulders are as you slip your hands inside his shirt to grab at them, wrapping your legs around his waist. \u00a0</p><p>Jin silences you with kisses, consuming the moans you make as he shallowly dips the tip in and out of you again and again and again till it there\u2019s no longer any pain. \u00a0You\u2019re so ready by the time he\u2019s done that if he rocked his hips even just the slightest bit harder you know he\u2019d slip straight inside and as he stills once more, so tantalisingly close, you\u2019re praying he\u2019ll do just that.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me again,\u201d Jin mumbles against your lips. \u00a0You\u2019re caught off guard by the hint of vulnerability that you detect, but given all he\u2019s been through today it should really come as no surprise that he\u2019s craving reassurance that he\u2019s still needed - still loved even if it\u2019s not quite in the same way.</p><p>You kiss him, sweetly, and lift your forehead to press it to his. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you, Seokjin. \u00a0I want this, want you.\u201d \u00a0You feel Jin nod and see the furrow in his brow right before he kisses you again, forcing your eyes closed. \u00a0His hips tilt and your rise up to meet him, guiding him effortlessly into place, and with his lips moulded to yours, Jin starts to slowly push inside. \u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s such a snug fit that the feeling of his cock breaching you has the of you both panting for air before he\u2019s even fully seated inside. \u00a0Jin doesn\u2019t hesitate or falter, though, not stopping until his pelvis is sat flush with yours and a simple squeeze of your inner muscles has him gasping and digging his fingertips into the flesh of your thigh, his eyes screwed shut tight. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Shibal</i>, I\u2019d forgotten how good this feels,\u201d Jin groans as he starts to move, smooth pushes and pulls that are neither too fast nor too slow. \u00a0\u201cSo warm.\u201d Jin cups your breast in his palm, kneading it firmly as he moves within you until a particular firm thrust has your whole body shifting, the table groaning beneath you with the force of it. \u00a0Wetness squelches around his cock as he does it again, grinning as you gasp and grab at his shoulders. \u201cSo fucking wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh g-god, Jin,\u201d you moan, clenching your thighs tighter around his waist, willing him not to stop. \u00a0You\u2019ve been waiting so long for this that you know it won\u2019t take long for you to cum. You can feel it building even now; the subtle curve of Jin\u2019s cock perfectly shaped to press against your g-spot with each and every thrust. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re squeezing so tight, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0Jin leans closer, closing the gap between your bodies so each rock of his hips has your breasts bouncing and his solid chest crashing into yours, \u00a0His mouth is on your neck, his breaths short and shallow against your skin. \u201cNo wonder the others can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>You whine mindlessly, so deliciously close that your toes are already starting to curl. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-harder, please,\u201d you pant breathlessly, digging your fingers into his hair and pushing him further into the crook of your neck. \u00a0You feel the lightest graze of his fangs against your throat and your whole pelvis clenches in response, your body well trained to anticipate the euphoria that being fed upon brings. \u00a0\u201cSeokjin, I\u2026 God, I\u2019m so close, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he smirks, lifting his head, \u201cYou like it a little rougher, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u00a0With his next thrust, Jin\u2019s hips come smacking savagely into yours, barely giving you any time to even catch your breath before he\u2019s pulling back and then slamming in again, lifting his chest off of yours and grabbing hold of your hips, towering over you. \u00a0</p><p>Try as he might, there\u2019s something about the position you\u2019re in that doesn\u2019t allow Jin to take you as fast as he would like. \u00a0Perhaps the table\u2019s too low or it\u2019s just not sturdy enough, but it feels like mere seconds before he\u2019s groaning with frustration and pulling out of you. \u00a0He grabs your hand, ignoring your questioning look.</p><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d he demands, pulling you to your feet and clutching you to him, weakening your knees when he slips one hand between your legs and immediately slides two fingers inside. \u00a0You can hear every curl of his fingers as every knuckle becomes coated with your wetness, and as he kisses the breath out of you it\u2019s all you can do to clutch onto his shirt to stay upright. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve done this sooner,\u201d Jin tells you through gritted teeth, his free hand digging tightly into your waist, his cock weeping against your hip while you fall to pieces around his fingers. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever get sick of such a pretty cunt as yours.\u201d</p><p>Almost as though he can sense how close you are to the precipice, Jin withdraws his digits from you and your eyes open, your whole body trembling with the injustice of it. \u00a0You can barely keep yourself upright but Jin seems unconcerned, busy yanking off his shirt and tossing it to the ground to reveal his naked physique in all its glory.</p><p>\u201cBend over,\u201d he instructs, dragging to towards the counter and then releasing your arm only to push at your back, forcing you to bend from the waist and lift your rear into the air, clutching the edge. \u00a0\u201cYou wanted it harder, right, sweetheart?\u201d He bends right over you, his sticky chest flush to your back. \u201cBetter hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly straightens, the sound of his deep inhale the only warning that you get before Jin impales you on the length of his cock. \u00a0He drags you back by the hips as he thrusts forward just as hard, the bones of his pelvis slamming into the flesh of your buttocks. Relentless, Jin has you wailing as he takes you just as roughly as he promised, driving into you again and again. \u00a0Each snap is so savage that you\u2019re certain you\u2019ll have bruises once he\u2019s through but it\u2019s not as though you care.</p><p>You\u2019re finally getting what you wanted - about to cum so hard you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll even be able to remember your name once he\u2019s through. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSuch a good girl,\u201d Jin praises, out of breath with exertion, \u201cMade for taking our cocks, weren\u2019t you? \u00a0Such a good little plaything for her masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d you sob in reply, your cheek pressed to the counter as Jin\u2019s fingers find their way into your hair and he tugs at the roots, \u201cGod, <i>yes!</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me how hard you can cum, sweetheart.\u201d \u00a0He tightens his grip, pushing your cheek harder into the countertop, \u201c<i>Show me</i>.\u201d \u00a0And you do - spectacularly. \u00a0</p><p>The pleasure that rips through you is so intense that you have to press your face to the hard surface to muffle the cries that burst forth from your lungs, and your hands shake as you desperately cling to the counter because Jin doesn\u2019t let up. \u00a0All the while you keen and curse he continues to drive into you, fucking you through your orgasm and out to the other side.</p><p>\u201cJin, <i>please</i>,\u201d you gasp, but now it\u2019s mercy for which you beg. \u00a0It\u2019s too much when he reaches between your legs and starts to rub at your clit, so overwhelming that you\u2019re having to bite your bottom lip to keep from crying out. \u201cI c-ca-can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>At your protest Jin steps back, a growl rumbling from his chest as he grabs at your limbs from behind. \u00a0Like a ragdoll he manhandles you, pulling you up straight and spinning you round to face him and then surging forward to slam his lips into yours. \u00a0With his fingertips digging into your upper arms he walks you back until you hit something hard and cold; pleasant against your heated skin. It\u2019s only when he\u2019s picked you up and resumed such a vigorous pace that you hear the jars inside rattling with every thrust that you even realise it\u2019s the refrigerator he\u2019s fucking you against.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure\u2026 you want me to stop?\u201d \u00a0Jin\u2019s voice is wrecked from where he speaks down into the crook of your neck, his arms wrapped as tightly around your waist as yours are around his hips, your buttocks in his palms. \u201cYour cunt says otherwise.\u201d \u00a0He lifts his head and smashes his lips into yours, all teeth and tongues as his thrusts drive deep, biting out his words. \u201cI can feel you squeezing around my cock again already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-fuck,\u201d you choke into his kiss, your fingernails raking lines of red across into the shoulder blades to which you cling. \u00a0You\u2019re so drunk on oxytocin that you can barely string two words together - so high on lingering endorphins that your body feels as though it should sing - and you don\u2019t ever want this feeling to stop. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeen so good to me tonight,\u201d he huffs, visibly beginning to tire from the ruthlessness of his efforts in spite of the supernatural stamina he\u2019s blessed with. \u201cDo you think you can cum with me, sweetheart? \u00a0Show me -\u201d Jin has to pause mid-sentence to catch his breath, his eyes pressing closed at the feel of your walls closing in around him, pushing towards his release. \u201c - show me how much you love my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cK-keep going and\u2026 and I will,\u201d you promise, just as breathless. \u00a0</p><p>Your hand are in Jin\u2019s hair when he suddenly changes pace. \u00a0His thrusts slow and each time he pulls back it\u2019s barely even halfway, yet somehow it feels even better than before. \u00a0Now, instead of filthy, frantic rutting, it\u2019s a deep, dirty grind that has his pubic bone grinding against your clit like a pestle and mortar with every circle of his hips, the head of his cock brushing your sweetest spot over and over again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>S-seokjin</i>\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d you warn, digging your fingers into his scalp. \u00a0He groans in acknowledgement, his breath heavy in your ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2026 w-where do you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d you answer without thought, your head falling back as the tide of pleasure begins to rise. \u00a0\u201cCum inside me, Jin. Oh <i>god</i>, I wanna feel you cum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Jin shouts, grabbing your ass so hard that it hurts. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s the slowest and deepest thrusts of all that finally push you both over the edge; each one dragged out as though he\u2019s trying to savour this last few precious seconds before it ends. \u00a0He\u2019s surprisingly quiet as he cums considering how vocal he\u2019s been so far but you can still feel how greatly he\u2019s affected. His cock pulses and twitches long after he\u2019s spilt every drop and it\u2019s started to drip down the inside of your thighs - his whole body trembling and his breaths similarly shuddering. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJin.\u201d \u00a0You utter his name ever so softly after a minute or so has passed where neither of you has moved nor said a word. \u00a0He has his forehead rested to yours, his eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks at the feel of you gently carding your fingers through his hair. \u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Part of you is worried that now the heat of the moment has passed Jin\u2019s mood might suddenly crash - that he might suddenly be overcome with guilt or regret everything that\u2019s just happened. \u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, when he opens his eyes and meets your gaze his smile may be small and somewhat lopsided, but at least it looks genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d \u00a0He begins the somewhat messy task of separating the two of you, adding, \u201cPromise,\u2019 when he sees the way you\u2019re searching his expression to see if anything looks amiss. \u00a0</p><p>Jin\u2019s nothing but attentive as he settles your feet back on the floor and waits until you\u2019re steady before leaving your side to collect the clothes that are strewn about the place. \u00a0He grins sheepishly as he comes back and sees you reaching for the roll of paper towels by the sink, thighs clenched together to avoid dripping onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he apologises as you wipe yourself clean with a grimace, wrinkling your nose at the scratchiness of the paper against your extra-sensitive parts. \u00a0\u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve picked a more practical location.\u201d Jin grins as you laugh, pulling on the clothes that he hands to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure there was enough forward planning involved for that\u2026.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he laughs along, pulling up his pants and then shrugging on his shirt. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t bother doing it up, though, just leaves it hanging open as he steps towards you with his hands outstretched. \u00a0Cupping your cheeks, Jin dips his head to kiss you.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d \u00a0His voice is tight with emotion as he says it, not yet pulling away. \u201cI think I needed that.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u201d you answer easily, slipping your hands under his shirt to press your palms to the flat of his back, gently caressing. You\u2019re relieved to feel how relaxed his muscles are beneath your hands - how slow and steady his breathing is. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t too rough?\u201d \u00a0You smile as Jin straightens up, his expression mildly embarrassed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNever too rough,\u201d you assure him, your tone turning playful after as you add, \u201cSo\u2026 my \u2018masters\u2019, eh?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Jin laughs heartily, taking a step back and rubbing awkwardly at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou caught that, huh?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d you giggle, leaning back against the edge of the counter and folding your arms. \u201cMost definitely.\u201d \u00a0<br>\u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018daddy\u2019 is much better, is it?\u201d he teases, and as he finally starts to button up his shirt you snort out a laugh, smiling broadly. \u00a0He has a point, you suppose.</p><p>Jin begins to clear up while you remain basking in the afterglow a little longer, propped up against the counter as you wait for some strength to return to your jellified legs. \u00a0He hums as he collects all the bottles and glasses from the table and deposits them into the sink to wash another time, and you\u2019re glad he seems as though he\u2019s in a better mood now than the state in which you found him, even if it may only be temporary.</p><p>\u201cI still think you should talk to Soo-Mi, you know,\u201d you say after a little while, coming to stand at his side. \u00a0Jin frowns at the remnants of the wine he\u2019s pouring down the drain, and at the sight of his furrowed brow you place a soothing hand in the small of his back, kneading through his shirt. \u00a0\u201cObviously it\u2019s your call, but I think it\u2019d be a shame to just let things go after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d He shrugs non committedly, sighing as he places the bottle down on the side to dry. \u00a0Turning around, he very gently passes his thumb across your cheek, smiling as you lean into it. \u00a0\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, \u201cWe should get you to bed. I\u2019ve kept you up long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming with, then?\u201d you chuckle when Jin offers you his hand, slipping your fingers between his without hesitation. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it, but I could hardly call myself a gentleman if I didn\u2019t at least walk you to your door, could I?\u201d \u00a0Well, you can hardly argue with that.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for you to arrive at Jimin\u2019s door. \u00a0Rather than let you go once you get there, however, Jin turns to you and takes your left hand as well, his expression earnest. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you again, for tonight,\u201d he says, squeezing your hands good and tight. \u00a0\u201cI really enjoyed it and\u2026 I hope you did too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d you smile, squeezing back. \u00a0Could there really be any doubt?</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d he grins, his normal bravado swiftly re-emerging now he\u2019s been suitably reassured. \u00a0\u201cGoodnight then, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight Jinnie.\u201d \u00a0You kiss him goodnight on your tiptoes and after one final squeeze of his hands, you disentangle your fingers from his and head into Jimin\u2019s room, grinning at the kiss he blows your way just the door presses shut. \u00a0</p><p>You\u2019re almost pleased to find that Jimin and Yoongi aren\u2019t home yet, your bed empty save where Nova is curled up in a ball on Yoongi\u2019s pillow. \u00a0It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not looking forward to seeing them, more that you know that if they were there waiting to beckon you under the duvet you wouldn\u2019t have the willpower to resist joining them despite the shower you so desperately need. \u00a0</p><p>You head to the bathroom without delay, stripping out of the clothes you\u2019ve only just recently put back on along the way. \u00a0The water\u2019s blissfully warm and it feels amazing against the soreness Jin left behind. You\u2019re so absorbed enjoying the heat of it seeping into your limbs, in fact, that you don\u2019t even realise you\u2019re no longer alone in the bathroom until the cubicle door opens and you feel hands upon your hips - lips brushing the back of your neck. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d already be in bed.\u201d \u00a0The familiar sound of Yoongi\u2019s low, gravelly voice relaxes you instantly and you lean back against his chest, releasing a contented hum when his lithe arms wrap around your waist. \u00a0\u201cJimin shouldn\u2019t be long. He\u2019s just speaking to Hoseok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, good,\u201d you sigh, luxuriating in the slow, soothing kisses he\u2019s trailing along the length of your neck. \u00a0\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d \u00a0You smile at Yoongi\u2019s self-assuredness, placing your hands on top of his to stop them from drifting up to fondle your breasts as you know he\u2019d been intending. \u00a0Your nipples are still far too sensitive for that thanks to all Jin\u2019s pinching and tweaking. \u201cI missed you too,\u201d he admits with a chuckle when you nudge him in the ribs with your elbow. \u00a0\u201cSo\u2026 why are you up so late?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly you\u2019re beset by a rush of nerves, mouth hanging open as you search for the courage it takes to reply. \u00a0You know that you need to tell Jimin and Yoongi about what\u2019s just happened with Jin, and you know that you all agreed to be honest with one another and that permission was no longer required but\u2026 what if the reality of it turns out to be more than they\u2019re able to bear? \u00a0What if Jimin changes his mind?</p><p>\u201cJin and Soo-Mi broke up,\u201d you begin, fiddling with fingers nervously where they rest upon your stomach, \u201cAnd he was\u2026 a little bit of a mess when I got home. \u00a0Found him in the kitchen busy drinking his own body weight in booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrowning his sorrows, hm? \u00a0Always a good plan,\u201d Yoongi muses dryly, and when you turn around in his arms, wet chest to wet chest, you see the slightest of smiles tugging at his lips. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing you helped him feel better, hm?\u201d \u00a0There\u2019s something about the way one of Yoongi\u2019s eyebrows rises and the slightly playful tone to his voice that has you blushing and glancing at your feet. Before you can say anything more or start to ramble your excuses, \u00a0Yoongi graces you with a gentle kiss, soothing your anxieties. \u201cI could smell him on your clothes, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d \u00a0You hesitate as the dark-haired vampire releases you and reaches for the shampoo, lathering up his hair. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not mad, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? \u00a0No.\u201d He prises one eye open to peek at you, foamy suds dripping down his forehead. \u00a0\u201cIf it helped then I\u2019m glad, as long as he treated you right. It\u2019s been a long time since <i>hyung </i>got laid\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d you confirm, pressing your body to his to sneak back under the water regardless of the risk of getting wayward shampoo splashes in your eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Yoongi replies once all the remaining shampoo is gone and he\u2019s passed his hands over his face, wiping the water out of his eyes. \u00a0Leaning past him, you take the shampoo for yourself, squirting a generous amount into your palm.</p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2026\u201d You glance at Yoongi who\u2019s listening attentively, his gaze straying only momentarily when your arms extend above your head and your chest bounces with the motion. \u00a0\u201cDo you think Jimin will mind\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Yoongi answers quickly, \u201cAnd if he does then just leave him to me.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You have to admit, it\u2019s more than a little reassuring to know that Yoongi\u2019s got your back should Jimin decide to become jealous despite everything you agreed. \u00a0Although Jimin may take the lead in the bedroom, you know that he respects the elder vampire greatly as his <i>hyung. \u00a0</i>Calm and collected, you\u2019ve seen how Yoongi\u2019s cool temper helps douse Jimin\u2019s natural fire, though in this case you really hope it won\u2019t be necessary. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere, let me,\u201d Yoongi beckons, hands on your waist to turn you around so that your back is facing him and he\u2019s able to take over washing your hair, his long fingers like heaven as they massage at your scalp. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you say softly, biting back a moan as he rubs firmly at your temples. \u00a0You don\u2019t just mean for the head rub, and you hope Yoongi realises that.</p><p>\u201cAnytime princess.\u201d \u00a0The two of you fall silent for a while after that, and as Yoongi replaces the shampoo in your hair with conditioner, combing it through, it takes every bit of willpower you possess not to fall asleep while you\u2019re leant against him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he suddenly exclaims causing you to very nearly jump out of your skin, head swinging round to look over your shoulder with wide and startled eyes. \u00a0\u201cI bet that bastard drank all my Barolo, didn\u2019t he?!\u201d</p>",

His thumbs drag across your stiff nipples, and very slow circle that passes over them has your innards clenching with excitement - your lip bitten to withhold all the gasps that threaten to part them. &nbsp;</p><p>You watch, insides quivering, as Jin&rsquo;s pillow soft lips pass over every inch of your stomach in a series of slow, lingering kisses. &nbsp;With his eyes closed he looks so serene; so handsome that it steals your breath away when he opens them and gazes up into yours.</p><p>In an almost trance-like state, you take off your top and let it fall carelessly to the floor so that Jin can take immediate advantage of your newly exposed skin. &nbsp;His kisses turn into wet flicks and licks of his tongue along your breastbone, all the way up till his face is nestled in your cleavage. He turns his head to the side to kiss the swell of your breast with a hum that sounds almost wistful; longing..</p><p>Threading your fingers gently through his hair, Jin is easily persuaded to turn his mouth&rsquo;s attention towards your nipple. &nbsp;A soft sigh escapes as you as he encases it with his lips, teasing your areola with the tip of his tongue whilst his thumb works the other, your back arching to press your breasts further into his eager hands. &nbsp;</p><p>The pleasure may feel exquisite but it&rsquo;s almost more than you can bear. &nbsp;Your body is more than ready and willing to receive him after having already brought Jin to a climax; each touch incensing you further, panting so hard that you&rsquo;re light-headed with desire. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jin,&rdquo; you utter quietly, pushing his hair back to better see his face. &nbsp;His strong jaw moves with every motion of his tongue as he sucks and licks and laps at you, a light crease of concentration etched into his brow as he works. &nbsp;&ldquo;Seokjin,&rdquo; you say again when he doesn&rsquo;t respond, &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes open as he lets your spit-slick nipple fall from his mouth, the corners of it cocked into a smirk. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to savour you, sweetheart,&rdquo; he tells you, placing another soft kiss to the space just above your navel. &ldquo;Patience.&rdquo; &nbsp;Eyes closing once more, Jin&rsquo;s mouth begins to work lower as his hands do the same, skimming over your lower back and buttocks while his lips trace the waistband of your bottoms, infuriatingly slow.</p><p>You&rsquo;re about to start pleading again when Jin suddenly gropes your behind with both hands, squeezing. &nbsp;He pushes his face right between your legs and inhales, the sound of it nothing short of obscene.</p><p>&ldquo;Jin!&rdquo; you gasp as heat floods into your cheeks, scandalised by his unexpectedly brazen behaviour. &nbsp;Despite you pushing at his head and squeezing your thighs together to try to discourage him all this does is make Jin laugh and nuzzle further into you, and when he finally does withdraw it&rsquo;s not without knocking the tip of his nose right into your clit to weaken your knees, first. &nbsp;</p><p>He rests his cheek against your stomach and smiles sweetly up at you, watching the way you squirm from the confusing mixture of embarrassment and arousal that&rsquo;s coursing through you.</p><p>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t get just how intoxicating your scent is, do you?&rdquo; Jin asks, and despite the teasing glimmer in his eyes, his words sound sincere. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to gorge myself between these thighs more times than I can count.&rdquo; You gasp as Jin&rsquo;s hands slip further down from your buttocks to the backs of your thighs, his fingertips mere inches away from brushing your core. &nbsp;</p><p>Your cheeks redden further, knowing Jin must be able to feel how sopping wet you are through the barrier of your thin clothes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Especially</i> when you&rsquo;re menstruating,&rdquo; he continues, eyes closing as if experiencing some sort of tortured bliss at the mere thought of it. &ldquo;<i>God</i>. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve no fucking clue.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>When you&hellip; w-when&hellip;</p><p>Your body that had been practically buzzing with excitement suddenly falls still, your stomach dropping unpleasantly. &nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;re not sure why it comes as such a shock, really, to have Jin mention it. &nbsp;When you&rsquo;d first moved into the mansion Jimin had warned you that it would likely be best to avoid the other vampires within the house at certain points of your cycle and to begin with. you&rsquo;d presumed this was purely for your safety - too much blood flowing freely was bound to be a temptation, after all. &nbsp;As time had gone on, though, and you&rsquo;d experienced your first period in Jimin&rsquo;s presence and witnessed just how insatiable he&rsquo;d become - in more ways than one - you began to understand that it might&rsquo;ve been for an entirely different purpose he&rsquo;d advised you to hide away.</p><p>True, it&rsquo;d taken you a while to get over your own squeamishness about that particular method of feeding. &nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t think of much else more disgusting, quite frankly, but later on, after having seen how Yoongi was similarly enthusiastic about it, you&rsquo;d been able to let go, happy that you were able to provide your lovers such nourishment.</p><p>You&rsquo;d gotten the feeling the vampires had made an effort to avoid you during those times, too, but you&rsquo;d always presumed it was Jimin who&rsquo;d warned them away rather than them having a direct awareness of it. &nbsp;To find out that Jin has been able to smell it every single month is&hellip; a little mortifying to say the least.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-you can&hellip;?&rdquo; &nbsp;Jin&rsquo;s smile broadens, his palms rubbing soothingly down the backs of your legs and slipping beneath the hem of your bottoms on their way back up. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, sweetheart,&rdquo; he teases, &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t walls thick enough that&rsquo;d keep the scent of you away.&rdquo; &nbsp;You bite your lip, legs quaking as his fingertips feather across the space where your thighs end and the curve of your buttocks begins. It&rsquo;s only when you neglect to say anything more that Jin seems to realise how awkward about it you feel. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t be embarrassed,&rdquo; he encourages, pausing to place a gentle kiss to your abdomen. &ldquo;Maybe Jungkook or some of the others might shy away from it, but the more mature of us - the more experienced - know better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried it, then?&rdquo; To be honest, you&rsquo;d always presumed that Jin&rsquo;s experience of real physical intimacy with women had come to an abrupt and complete end the very moment he&rsquo;d been turned. &nbsp;Apparently, you&rsquo;d thought wrong.</p><p>Jin huffs a wry laugh, his smile no longer quite meeting his eyes the way it had before. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon and I shared many experiences just after we were first turned&hellip; and well, let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;ve been one to turn down a free meal.&rdquo; &nbsp;You feel your eyes widen almost comically at the mention of Namjoon&rsquo;s name, but thankfully Jin is too busy kissing your stomach to notice that his words have given you pause. &nbsp;</p><p>When he says &lsquo;shared&rsquo;, does that mean&hellip;? &nbsp;Before tonight you never in your wildest dreams would&rsquo;ve thought that Jin and Namjoon would harbour similar sexual appetites. &nbsp;In your mind, the two of them couldn&rsquo;t be more like chalk and cheese, but it sounds as though the eldest vampire likes to be a little more savage between the sheets than you&rsquo;d originally expected&hellip;. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a proper look at you, sweetheart,&rdquo; you hear Jin mumble as he hooks his thumbs into the waistband of your bottoms, distracting you from your thoughts. &nbsp;He slowly inches them down, and you try not to blush once they pass over the thickest part of your thighs and then fall to the floor, taking a thick, glossy strand of your arousal with them. &nbsp;</p><p>He parts your labia with his thumbs and smiles at the sight of your engorged clit, his touch all too fleeting. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; he decides, and quicker than you can blink Jin suddenly stands and lifts you, gasping, off of your feet, placing you right back down on the cold surface of the dining table. &nbsp;Lying you down, he grins wolfishly at the way you shudder and takes a moment to stand at the edge of the table, unbuttoning his shirt as he surveys you laid out beneath him.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; Jin begins once his shirt hangs open to expose the subtle musculature of his chest, &ldquo;That you&rsquo;re the only meal this table will have ever seen.&rdquo; &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t seem to muster a reply, too focused on remembering to breathe as Jin nonchalantly reaches into your glass tumbler and retrieves a remaining cube of ice. Grasped between his thumb and forefinger, he shows it to you before popping it into his mouth. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;W-what are you-?&rdquo; you begin as he leans over you, your sentence cut short by the freezing cold kiss he presses between your cleavage and the strangled sound that bursts forth from your lungs. &nbsp;Jin&rsquo;s hands are rested on each of your thighs as his mouth wanders, the ice held between his puckered lips to drag it directly across your skin as you try to keep your body from flinching underneath him, instinct causing you to try and wriggle away from the unfamiliar sensation. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; &nbsp;The exclamation escapes you before you can hold it back as Jin diverts from the trail of icy water he&rsquo;s smeared between your breasts and turns his attention to your nipples.. &nbsp;&ldquo;Holy s-shit, that&rsquo;s cold&hellip;&rdquo; When his eyes open they&rsquo;re full of devilish delight, watching the way your eyebrows furrow and you bite your lip as he slowly rubs the ice slowly back and forth over the painfully hardened peak. &nbsp;</p><p>Under his loving assault, your sensitive flesh flushes from pink to red - numb with cold and yet somehow tingling and throbbing all at once - and god, you love the way it feels. &nbsp;Your fingers flex, fingernails pressing into the surface of the table for purchase as Jin reaches for another piece of ice and begins to rub that one into your other nipple to make you gasp and bow all over again.</p><p>Slowly, each cube begins to melt, and your body shudders as tiny droplets of icy water dribble down the sides of your breasts. &nbsp;Jin swallows the remains of what&rsquo;s left in his mouth but his kiss remains just as cold even without the ice caught between his teeth, goosebumps rising along your skin as he abandons your breasts in favour of trailing his lips down your stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;One more, I think.&rdquo; &nbsp;Tipping your chin forward, you see Jin pluck another ice cube from his glass. &nbsp;He glances at you, smiling, as he pops it in his mouth and then leans over you and deposits it directly into the dip of your belly-button, chuckling when your whole body jolts underneath him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so responsive, sweetheart,&rdquo; he admires as you pant and shiver, willing the ice to melt as fast as possible as you stare down at it. With the way Jin has you burning up, surely it shouldn&rsquo;t take long? &nbsp;&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo;</p><p>His kiss travels lower as his hands caress your thighs, and you find yourself holding your breath in anticipation as Jin drops into a deep squat and pushes gently at your knees, spreading you open. &nbsp;You feel the softness of Jin&rsquo;s mouth press kisses into the inside of your thighs, from one side to the other as they climb ever higher and higher, closer to your core.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep it up, ok?&rdquo; you hear him say, and you can feel each word right between your legs, close enough to feel his breath. &ldquo;Let me know if I&rsquo;m not meeting your expectations,&rdquo; he adds. &nbsp;The smile you can hear in his voice helps to make you relax, unwinding the tightness in your shoulders as you smile up at the ceiling, biting your lip to withhold a giggle.</p><p>Trust him to try and make you laugh at a time like this. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jin&rsquo;s lips are so breathtakingly cold that the first touch them makes your whole body jump on contact, falling still only once he&rsquo;s taken hold of your hips to hold you in place to better trace every inch of your anatomy with his tongue. &nbsp;You wish he&rsquo;d done it sooner; by moving so sharply you&rsquo;d managed to make the small amount of melted water in your navel spill over, and now you&rsquo;re driven to distraction by the feel of it dribbling slowly down your side, tickling as it goes. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Jesus,&rdquo; you groan as he steals your attention back with a firm swipe against your clitoris, top to bottom and then side to side, wriggling figures of eight into tight little nub as his head tilts from side to side, his nose pressed close to your pubic mound. &nbsp;With every flick the most gorgeous jolts of pleasure ascend your spine, fogging your brain till you&rsquo;re completely lost to anything else than the sensations between your legs.</p><p>His hair is soft when you reach down and thread your fingers through it - the finest of silks - and when you gently tug on it in encouragement, willing him to delve deeper, Jin is quick to oblige. &nbsp;He hums in acknowledgement of your wishes, briefly opening his eyes to look up into yours as his licks turn into open mouth kisses that descend until his pouted lips are pressed directly to your entrance. &nbsp;</p><p>Diligently, he begins to feast. &nbsp;Jin lets no drop of your arousal go to waste, adding to it with the saliva that he licks into your pussy, the tip of his tongue dipping inside you as his nose rubs against your clit. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Seokjin.&rdquo; &nbsp;He gives no sign that he&rsquo;s heard your wanton moan save the tightening of his grip around your hips, far too absorbed in enjoying the task at hand to want to waste even a single second. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jin,&rdquo; you mewl, twisting in his hold as he returns to your clit and sucks it sharply between his lips. You&rsquo;re too far gone to care about the water spilling from your navel every time you shift on the table&rsquo;s surface, unconcerned with the fresh wave of goosebumps it summons across your skin. &nbsp;&ldquo;Your fingers, p-please&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;ve done this enough times now to know that you struggle to find with clitoral stimulation alone; aching for that feeling of fullness inside. &nbsp;All you want is for him to slip the digits that are now sliding from your hip and down your thigh inside of you, and your hips flex up from the table as though chasing after them as he unhurriedly draws them upward again, tickling. &nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;re about reaching the limits of this &lsquo;patience&rsquo; that Jin mentioned&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; you beseech again, reaching out to take a hold of his wrist and drag his touch closer to where you so desperately need it only to have your hand slapped away, groaning in frustration when he removes himself from you. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s his cocked eyebrow that you see first as he emerges from between your legs and stands to full height - his smirking mouth shortly after, slick with your essence.</p><p>He tuts loudly as he leans over you, one hand on the table and the other pinning your wrist by your side. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you always this impatient?&rdquo; he questions, cocking his head as he looks down at you. &nbsp;&nbsp;His bangs fall in front of his eyes, the rest of his hair slightly dishevelled from how often you&rsquo;ve run your fingers through it. &nbsp;You bite your lip and glance away, cheeks red from his teasing chastisement. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he persists, squeezing at your wrist, &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;M-maybe,&rdquo; you admit, willfully understating the size of your sexual appetite. &nbsp;Ever since Jimin introduced to life&rsquo;s more carnal delights you&rsquo;ve hardly been able to get your fill; insatiable since the moment you met. &nbsp;Would you be like this with any other lover, you wonder, or is it his influence and the company you keep that made you this way?</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly you&rsquo;ve been spoiled.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jin lets go of your wrist, his smile growing at the needful groan you release at the sliding of his palm along the inside of your thigh and your whine of discontent when he steals it away. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the fun in always getting what you want right away?&rdquo; Again he brushes his fingertips against you; a brief passing of his index finger against your swollen clitoris. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find the rewards far more satisfying when you&rsquo;ve really had to work for them, sweetheart.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Desperately trying to ignore the fierce ache deep down within your abdomen, you sit up and lean back on your elbows, face flushed and bottom lip bitten as you ask,</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; &nbsp;Frankly, you&rsquo;re willing to do anything if it means Jin will actually<i> touch</i> you rather than torment you with the slow circles he&rsquo;s drawing in the wetness smeared across the tops of your thighs. &nbsp;</p><p>Jin smiles, pleased, and then leans in to press a chaste kiss to your lips. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me exactly what you want&hellip; and just how much you want it,&rdquo; he breathes into your ear, soft and seductive, &ldquo;And maybe I&rsquo;ll give it to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I want you,&rdquo; you begin, stating the obvious as Jin begins to smatter your skin in lingering kisses, your cheeks blazing with heat underneath the press of his lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Want you to fuck me, so bad.&rdquo; Another kiss to the slant of your jaw, your head tipping back.</p><p>Considering how imagining Jin in any kind of sexual context had made you blush so hotly, you can barely believe how carelessly you&rsquo;ve begun to speak. &nbsp;With every centimetre his fingertips creep closer to your core the more shameless you become, barely even registering the garbled, filthy words that are falling from your mouth. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Need your cock, Seokjin, please.&rdquo; &nbsp;You make a grab for the front of his shirt where it remains hanging open, tugging on it for emphasis. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip; I&rsquo;ll do anything you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You said it was it my fingers you wanted a second ago. &nbsp;Which is it?&rdquo; he presses in that same teasing tone as before, sliding them slowly from top to bottom of your labia and then back up again. &ldquo;Make up your mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything!&rdquo; you very nearly shout as he pinches at your clit, the sting of it so strong that it has you slumping from your elbows onto your back, skin slapping against the table. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; you repeat, softer, a lump forming in your throat as frustration threatens to overwhelm you completely - so tightly wound that your legs are beginning to tremble from wanting alone.</p><p>Closing your eyes in an attempt to calm yourself, you turn your head to the side to find Jin&rsquo;s hand waiting for you there. &nbsp;He tenderly cradles your cheek in your palm as he kisses the other, the feel of his chest pressed to yours heavy and yet comforting in its coolness; a soothing balm against your fevered skin. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good girl, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he praises, nuzzling you affectionately. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wanna be nice and tight for me, is that it?&rdquo;</p><p>Weakly, you nod, your breath hitching when you feel Jin reach between bodies and hear the rustling of fabric as he pushes his bottoms further down. &nbsp;Soon enough, his blunt girth is pressing between your legs, hot and impatient, and you let your legs flop open wider as he begins to tease the weeping head back and forth amongst your wetness, lubricating himself. &nbsp;</p><p>You know it&rsquo;ll be a stretch without Jin having eased you open first - you&rsquo;ve felt how thick he is first hand, after all - but by this point, you&rsquo;re well past caring. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll happily accommodate anything he&rsquo;s willing to give so long as it finally means you&rsquo;ll be granted some relief.</p><p>&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;ve got such a sweet little cunt,&rdquo; he grunts before seizing your mouth with his, releasing your face to grab at your hips and pull you right to the edge of the table so he can better angle himself to enter you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Seokjin, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; you plead as he pushes barely an inch inside, waiting until the stretch has you tense and gasping before pulling back again &nbsp;You&rsquo;re sure he&rsquo;s tormenting himself just as much as he is you; you can feel how taut his shoulders are as you slip your hands inside his shirt to grab at them, wrapping your legs around his waist. &nbsp;</p><p>Jin silences you with kisses, consuming the moans you make as he shallowly dips the tip in and out of you again and again and again till it there&rsquo;s no longer any pain. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re so ready by the time he&rsquo;s done that if he rocked his hips even just the slightest bit harder you know he&rsquo;d slip straight inside and as he stills once more, so tantalisingly close, you&rsquo;re praying he&rsquo;ll do just that.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me you want me again,&rdquo; Jin mumbles against your lips. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re caught off guard by the hint of vulnerability that you detect, but given all he&rsquo;s been through today it should really come as no surprise that he&rsquo;s craving reassurance that he&rsquo;s still needed - still loved even if it&rsquo;s not quite in the same way.</p><p>You kiss him, sweetly, and lift your forehead to press it to his. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I want you, Seokjin. &nbsp;I want this, want you.&rdquo; &nbsp;You feel Jin nod and see the furrow in his brow right before he kisses you again, forcing your eyes closed. &nbsp;His hips tilt and your rise up to meet him, guiding him effortlessly into place, and with his lips moulded to yours, Jin starts to slowly push inside. &nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s such a snug fit that the feeling of his cock breaching you has the of you both panting for air before he&rsquo;s even fully seated inside. &nbsp;Jin doesn&rsquo;t hesitate or falter, though, not stopping until his pelvis is sat flush with yours and a simple squeeze of your inner muscles has him gasping and digging his fingertips into the flesh of your thigh, his eyes screwed shut tight. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shibal</i>, I&rsquo;d forgotten how good this feels,&rdquo; Jin groans as he starts to move, smooth pushes and pulls that are neither too fast nor too slow. &nbsp;&ldquo;So warm.&rdquo; Jin cups your breast in his palm, kneading it firmly as he moves within you until a particular firm thrust has your whole body shifting, the table groaning beneath you with the force of it. &nbsp;Wetness squelches around his cock as he does it again, grinning as you gasp and grab at his shoulders. &ldquo;So fucking wet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh g-god, Jin,&rdquo; you moan, clenching your thighs tighter around his waist, willing him not to stop. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve been waiting so long for this that you know it won&rsquo;t take long for you to cum. You can feel it building even now; the subtle curve of Jin&rsquo;s cock perfectly shaped to press against your g-spot with each and every thrust. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re squeezing so tight, sweetheart.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jin leans closer, closing the gap between your bodies so each rock of his hips has your breasts bouncing and his solid chest crashing into yours, &nbsp;His mouth is on your neck, his breaths short and shallow against your skin. &ldquo;No wonder the others can&rsquo;t get enough of you.&rdquo;</p><p>You whine mindlessly, so deliciously close that your toes are already starting to curl. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;H-harder, please,&rdquo; you pant breathlessly, digging your fingers into his hair and pushing him further into the crook of your neck. &nbsp;You feel the lightest graze of his fangs against your throat and your whole pelvis clenches in response, your body well trained to anticipate the euphoria that being fed upon brings. &nbsp;&ldquo;Seokjin, I&hellip; God, I&rsquo;m so close, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he smirks, lifting his head, &ldquo;You like it a little rougher, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; &nbsp;With his next thrust, Jin&rsquo;s hips come smacking savagely into yours, barely giving you any time to even catch your breath before he&rsquo;s pulling back and then slamming in again, lifting his chest off of yours and grabbing hold of your hips, towering over you. &nbsp;</p><p>Try as he might, there&rsquo;s something about the position you&rsquo;re in that doesn&rsquo;t allow Jin to take you as fast as he would like. &nbsp;Perhaps the table&rsquo;s too low or it&rsquo;s just not sturdy enough, but it feels like mere seconds before he&rsquo;s groaning with frustration and pulling out of you. &nbsp;He grabs your hand, ignoring your questioning look.</p><p>&ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo; he demands, pulling you to your feet and clutching you to him, weakening your knees when he slips one hand between your legs and immediately slides two fingers inside. &nbsp;You can hear every curl of his fingers as every knuckle becomes coated with your wetness, and as he kisses the breath out of you it&rsquo;s all you can do to clutch onto his shirt to stay upright. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We should&rsquo;ve done this sooner,&rdquo; Jin tells you through gritted teeth, his free hand digging tightly into your waist, his cock weeping against your hip while you fall to pieces around his fingers. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could ever get sick of such a pretty cunt as yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Almost as though he can sense how close you are to the precipice, Jin withdraws his digits from you and your eyes open, your whole body trembling with the injustice of it. &nbsp;You can barely keep yourself upright but Jin seems unconcerned, busy yanking off his shirt and tossing it to the ground to reveal his naked physique in all its glory.</p><p>&ldquo;Bend over,&rdquo; he instructs, dragging to towards the counter and then releasing your arm only to push at your back, forcing you to bend from the waist and lift your rear into the air, clutching the edge. &nbsp;&ldquo;You wanted it harder, right, sweetheart?&rdquo; He bends right over you, his sticky chest flush to your back. &ldquo;Better hold on tight.&rdquo;</p><p>He suddenly straightens, the sound of his deep inhale the only warning that you get before Jin impales you on the length of his cock. &nbsp;He drags you back by the hips as he thrusts forward just as hard, the bones of his pelvis slamming into the flesh of your buttocks. Relentless, Jin has you wailing as he takes you just as roughly as he promised, driving into you again and again. &nbsp;Each snap is so savage that you&rsquo;re certain you&rsquo;ll have bruises once he&rsquo;s through but it&rsquo;s not as though you care.</p><p>You&rsquo;re finally getting what you wanted - about to cum so hard you&rsquo;re not sure you&rsquo;ll even be able to remember your name once he&rsquo;s through. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Such a good girl,&rdquo; Jin praises, out of breath with exertion, &ldquo;Made for taking our cocks, weren&rsquo;t you? &nbsp;Such a good little plaything for her masters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; you sob in reply, your cheek pressed to the counter as Jin&rsquo;s fingers find their way into your hair and he tugs at the roots, &ldquo;God, <i>yes!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Show me how hard you can cum, sweetheart.&rdquo; &nbsp;He tightens his grip, pushing your cheek harder into the countertop, &ldquo;<i>Show me</i>.&rdquo; &nbsp;And you do - spectacularly. &nbsp;</p><p>The pleasure that rips through you is so intense that you have to press your face to the hard surface to muffle the cries that burst forth from your lungs, and your hands shake as you desperately cling to the counter because Jin doesn&rsquo;t let up. &nbsp;All the while you keen and curse he continues to drive into you, fucking you through your orgasm and out to the other side.</p><p>&ldquo;Jin, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; you gasp, but now it&rsquo;s mercy for which you beg. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s too much when he reaches between your legs and starts to rub at your clit, so overwhelming that you&rsquo;re having to bite your bottom lip to keep from crying out. &ldquo;I c-ca-can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>At your protest Jin steps back, a growl rumbling from his chest as he grabs at your limbs from behind. &nbsp;Like a ragdoll he manhandles you, pulling you up straight and spinning you round to face him and then surging forward to slam his lips into yours. &nbsp;With his fingertips digging into your upper arms he walks you back until you hit something hard and cold; pleasant against your heated skin. It&rsquo;s only when he&rsquo;s picked you up and resumed such a vigorous pace that you hear the jars inside rattling with every thrust that you even realise it&rsquo;s the refrigerator he&rsquo;s fucking you against.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure&hellip; you want me to stop?&rdquo; &nbsp;Jin&rsquo;s voice is wrecked from where he speaks down into the crook of your neck, his arms wrapped as tightly around your waist as yours are around his hips, your buttocks in his palms. &ldquo;Your cunt says otherwise.&rdquo; &nbsp;He lifts his head and smashes his lips into yours, all teeth and tongues as his thrusts drive deep, biting out his words. &ldquo;I can feel you squeezing around my cock again already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;F-fuck,&rdquo; you choke into his kiss, your fingernails raking lines of red across into the shoulder blades to which you cling. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re so drunk on oxytocin that you can barely string two words together - so high on lingering endorphins that your body feels as though it should sing - and you don&rsquo;t ever want this feeling to stop. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Been so good to me tonight,&rdquo; he huffs, visibly beginning to tire from the ruthlessness of his efforts in spite of the supernatural stamina he&rsquo;s blessed with. &ldquo;Do you think you can cum with me, sweetheart? &nbsp;Show me -&rdquo; Jin has to pause mid-sentence to catch his breath, his eyes pressing closed at the feel of your walls closing in around him, pushing towards his release. &ldquo; - show me how much you love my cock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;K-keep going and&hellip; and I will,&rdquo; you promise, just as breathless. &nbsp;</p><p>Your hand are in Jin&rsquo;s hair when he suddenly changes pace. &nbsp;His thrusts slow and each time he pulls back it&rsquo;s barely even halfway, yet somehow it feels even better than before. &nbsp;Now, instead of filthy, frantic rutting, it&rsquo;s a deep, dirty grind that has his pubic bone grinding against your clit like a pestle and mortar with every circle of his hips, the head of his cock brushing your sweetest spot over and over again. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>S-seokjin</i>&hellip; I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m gonna cum,&rdquo; you warn, digging your fingers into his scalp. &nbsp;He groans in acknowledgement, his breath heavy in your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&hellip; w-where do you want it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Inside,&rdquo; you answer without thought, your head falling back as the tide of pleasure begins to rise. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cum inside me, Jin. Oh <i>god</i>, I wanna feel you cum!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; Jin shouts, grabbing your ass so hard that it hurts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s the slowest and deepest thrusts of all that finally push you both over the edge; each one dragged out as though he&rsquo;s trying to savour this last few precious seconds before it ends. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s surprisingly quiet as he cums considering how vocal he&rsquo;s been so far but you can still feel how greatly he&rsquo;s affected. His cock pulses and twitches long after he&rsquo;s spilt every drop and it&rsquo;s started to drip down the inside of your thighs - his whole body trembling and his breaths similarly shuddering. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jin.&rdquo; &nbsp;You utter his name ever so softly after a minute or so has passed where neither of you has moved nor said a word. &nbsp;He has his forehead rested to yours, his eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks at the feel of you gently carding your fingers through his hair. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Part of you is worried that now the heat of the moment has passed Jin&rsquo;s mood might suddenly crash - that he might suddenly be overcome with guilt or regret everything that&rsquo;s just happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, when he opens his eyes and meets your gaze his smile may be small and somewhat lopsided, but at least it looks genuine.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; &nbsp;He begins the somewhat messy task of separating the two of you, adding, &ldquo;Promise,&rsquo; when he sees the way you&rsquo;re searching his expression to see if anything looks amiss. &nbsp;</p><p>Jin&rsquo;s nothing but attentive as he settles your feet back on the floor and waits until you&rsquo;re steady before leaving your side to collect the clothes that are strewn about the place. &nbsp;He grins sheepishly as he comes back and sees you reaching for the roll of paper towels by the sink, thighs clenched together to avoid dripping onto the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he apologises as you wipe yourself clean with a grimace, wrinkling your nose at the scratchiness of the paper against your extra-sensitive parts. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe we should&rsquo;ve picked a more practical location.&rdquo; Jin grins as you laugh, pulling on the clothes that he hands to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure there was enough forward planning involved for that&hellip;.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he laughs along, pulling up his pants and then shrugging on his shirt. &nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t bother doing it up, though, just leaves it hanging open as he steps towards you with his hands outstretched. &nbsp;Cupping your cheeks, Jin dips his head to kiss you.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; &nbsp;His voice is tight with emotion as he says it, not yet pulling away. &ldquo;I think I needed that.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; you answer easily, slipping your hands under his shirt to press your palms to the flat of his back, gently caressing. You&rsquo;re relieved to feel how relaxed his muscles are beneath your hands - how slow and steady his breathing is. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t too rough?&rdquo; &nbsp;You smile as Jin straightens up, his expression mildly embarrassed. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Never too rough,&rdquo; you assure him, your tone turning playful after as you add, &ldquo;So&hellip; my &lsquo;masters&rsquo;, eh?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Jin laughs heartily, taking a step back and rubbing awkwardly at the back of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;You caught that, huh?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; you giggle, leaning back against the edge of the counter and folding your arms. &ldquo;Most definitely.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like &lsquo;daddy&rsquo; is much better, is it?&rdquo; he teases, and as he finally starts to button up his shirt you snort out a laugh, smiling broadly. &nbsp;He has a point, you suppose.</p><p>Jin begins to clear up while you remain basking in the afterglow a little longer, propped up against the counter as you wait for some strength to return to your jellified legs. &nbsp;He hums as he collects all the bottles and glasses from the table and deposits them into the sink to wash another time, and you&rsquo;re glad he seems as though he&rsquo;s in a better mood now than the state in which you found him, even if it may only be temporary.</p><p>&ldquo;I still think you should talk to Soo-Mi, you know,&rdquo; you say after a little while, coming to stand at his side. &nbsp;Jin frowns at the remnants of the wine he&rsquo;s pouring down the drain, and at the sight of his furrowed brow you place a soothing hand in the small of his back, kneading through his shirt. &nbsp;&ldquo;Obviously it&rsquo;s your call, but I think it&rsquo;d be a shame to just let things go after all this time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; He shrugs non committedly, sighing as he places the bottle down on the side to dry. &nbsp;Turning around, he very gently passes his thumb across your cheek, smiling as you lean into it. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;We should get you to bed. I&rsquo;ve kept you up long enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you coming with, then?&rdquo; you chuckle when Jin offers you his hand, slipping your fingers between his without hesitation. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t planning on it, but I could hardly call myself a gentleman if I didn&rsquo;t at least walk you to your door, could I?&rdquo; &nbsp;Well, you can hardly argue with that.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take long for you to arrive at Jimin&rsquo;s door. &nbsp;Rather than let you go once you get there, however, Jin turns to you and takes your left hand as well, his expression earnest. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you again, for tonight,&rdquo; he says, squeezing your hands good and tight. &nbsp;&ldquo;I really enjoyed it and&hellip; I hope you did too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; you smile, squeezing back. &nbsp;Could there really be any doubt?</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you did,&rdquo; he grins, his normal bravado swiftly re-emerging now he&rsquo;s been suitably reassured. &nbsp;&ldquo;Goodnight then, sweetheart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight Jinnie.&rdquo; &nbsp;You kiss him goodnight on your tiptoes and after one final squeeze of his hands, you disentangle your fingers from his and head into Jimin&rsquo;s room, grinning at the kiss he blows your way just the door presses shut. &nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;re almost pleased to find that Jimin and Yoongi aren&rsquo;t home yet, your bed empty save where Nova is curled up in a ball on Yoongi&rsquo;s pillow. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re not looking forward to seeing them, more that you know that if they were there waiting to beckon you under the duvet you wouldn&rsquo;t have the willpower to resist joining them despite the shower you so desperately need. &nbsp;</p><p>You head to the bathroom without delay, stripping out of the clothes you&rsquo;ve only just recently put back on along the way. &nbsp;The water&rsquo;s blissfully warm and it feels amazing against the soreness Jin left behind. You&rsquo;re so absorbed enjoying the heat of it seeping into your limbs, in fact, that you don&rsquo;t even realise you&rsquo;re no longer alone in the bathroom until the cubicle door opens and you feel hands upon your hips - lips brushing the back of your neck. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d already be in bed.&rdquo; &nbsp;The familiar sound of Yoongi&rsquo;s low, gravelly voice relaxes you instantly and you lean back against his chest, releasing a contented hum when his lithe arms wrap around your waist. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jimin shouldn&rsquo;t be long. He&rsquo;s just speaking to Hoseok.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, good,&rdquo; you sigh, luxuriating in the slow, soothing kisses he&rsquo;s trailing along the length of your neck. &nbsp;&ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; &nbsp;You smile at Yoongi&rsquo;s self-assuredness, placing your hands on top of his to stop them from drifting up to fondle your breasts as you know he&rsquo;d been intending. &nbsp;Your nipples are still far too sensitive for that thanks to all Jin&rsquo;s pinching and tweaking. &ldquo;I missed you too,&rdquo; he admits with a chuckle when you nudge him in the ribs with your elbow. &nbsp;&ldquo;So&hellip; why are you up so late?&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly you&rsquo;re beset by a rush of nerves, mouth hanging open as you search for the courage it takes to reply. &nbsp;You know that you need to tell Jimin and Yoongi about what&rsquo;s just happened with Jin, and you know that you all agreed to be honest with one another and that permission was no longer required but&hellip; what if the reality of it turns out to be more than they&rsquo;re able to bear? &nbsp;What if Jimin changes his mind?</p><p>&ldquo;Jin and Soo-Mi broke up,&rdquo; you begin, fiddling with fingers nervously where they rest upon your stomach, &ldquo;And he was&hellip; a little bit of a mess when I got home. &nbsp;Found him in the kitchen busy drinking his own body weight in booze.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Drowning his sorrows, hm? &nbsp;Always a good plan,&rdquo; Yoongi muses dryly, and when you turn around in his arms, wet chest to wet chest, you see the slightest of smiles tugging at his lips. &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m guessing you helped him feel better, hm?&rdquo; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s something about the way one of Yoongi&rsquo;s eyebrows rises and the slightly playful tone to his voice that has you blushing and glancing at your feet. Before you can say anything more or start to ramble your excuses, &nbsp;Yoongi graces you with a gentle kiss, soothing your anxieties. &ldquo;I could smell him on your clothes, princess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; &nbsp;You hesitate as the dark-haired vampire releases you and reaches for the shampoo, lathering up his hair. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad, are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mad? &nbsp;No.&rdquo; He prises one eye open to peek at you, foamy suds dripping down his forehead. &nbsp;&ldquo;If it helped then I&rsquo;m glad, as long as he treated you right. It&rsquo;s been a long time since <i>hyung </i>got laid&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; you confirm, pressing your body to his to sneak back under the water regardless of the risk of getting wayward shampoo splashes in your eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Yoongi replies once all the remaining shampoo is gone and he&rsquo;s passed his hands over his face, wiping the water out of his eyes. &nbsp;Leaning past him, you take the shampoo for yourself, squirting a generous amount into your palm.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think&hellip;&rdquo; You glance at Yoongi who&rsquo;s listening attentively, his gaze straying only momentarily when your arms extend above your head and your chest bounces with the motion. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think Jimin will mind&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Yoongi answers quickly, &ldquo;And if he does then just leave him to me.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>You have to admit, it&rsquo;s more than a little reassuring to know that Yoongi&rsquo;s got your back should Jimin decide to become jealous despite everything you agreed. &nbsp;Although Jimin may take the lead in the bedroom, you know that he respects the elder vampire greatly as his <i>hyung. &nbsp;</i>Calm and collected, you&rsquo;ve seen how Yoongi&rsquo;s cool temper helps douse Jimin&rsquo;s natural fire, though in this case you really hope it won&rsquo;t be necessary. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Here, let me,&rdquo; Yoongi beckons, hands on your waist to turn you around so that your back is facing him and he&rsquo;s able to take over washing your hair, his long fingers like heaven as they massage at your scalp. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you say softly, biting back a moan as he rubs firmly at your temples. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t just mean for the head rub, and you hope Yoongi realises that.</p><p>&ldquo;Anytime princess.&rdquo; &nbsp;The two of you fall silent for a while after that, and as Yoongi replaces the shampoo in your hair with conditioner, combing it through, it takes every bit of willpower you possess not to fall asleep while you&rsquo;re leant against him. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaims causing you to very nearly jump out of your skin, head swinging round to look over your shoulder with wide and startled eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I bet that bastard drank all my Barolo, didn&rsquo;t he?!&rdquo;</p>",
