I can\u2019t believe\u00a0I\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>Letting out a soft laugh, Layla came to stand right behind her best friend in front of the full-length mirror. Now with her wedding dress on, Y/N looked like the prettiest princess from a story book, and the thought made Layla smile as they locked eyes in the mirror. Even if Y/N hadn\u2019t repeatedly mentioned how nervous she was, her ragged breathing would already have given herself away.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you\u2019d been ready for this day your whole life?\u201d Layla chuckled, crossing her arms as she watched a beam grow on the bride\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Y/N sucked in a breath.\u00a0\u201cIt was\u00a0easier to imagine.\u201d<br/></p><p>Layla nodded slightly and stepped forward to wrap her arms around the maid-of-honor\u2019s waist, chin resting on her shoulder as they exchanged nonchalant smiles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d said the green-eyed girl.\u00a0\u201cKnowing that I\u2019ve been here with you guys from the start of it all makes me so emotional.\u201d<br/></p><p>Her statement caused Y/N to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you kind of hated me at the beginning.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Layla laughed, rolling her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYour hideous outfits got on my nerves, no offence.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAunt Y/N!\u201d<br/></p><p>The high-pitched voice got both girls to turn to the entrance when the little girl burst into the room and rushed towards the bride, hugging her tightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d Y/N bent down to hold the child by the arms.\u00a0\u201cHi, my love. Look at you in your tiny dress! Oh my god, you look like a little princess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, aunt Y/N. You look like a princess too!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cEl, do not disturb your aunt!\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N looked up to find her sister standing at the door. As Maisie marched forward to grab the little girl, Y/N pulled Eleanor close to her chest .\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Maisie. I\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should already be done right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still pretty earl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLayla!\u201d Y/N stood up fast and turned to her best friend.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t say that in front of El!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your skirt!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Layla quickly grabbed Y/N by the shoulders and dragged her to the mirror so she could see the big problem for herself. Two red handprints stood out on the white fabric and could be seen from miles away let alone up close. Y/N tugged on the skirt of her dress in shock, for a second completely speechless and freaked out by the reflection in the mirror.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d Maisie shouted, forcing her daughter to show both of her hands.\u00a0\u201cOh god, were you just messing with those paint buckets in the lobby?!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no, sis, it\u2019s fine! Don\u2019t yell at her!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFine?!\u201d Layla cried out.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got red handprints on your ass! How the fuck is <i>this</i> fine?!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWho got what on her ass now?!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJesus&hellip;\u201d Y/N cursed under her breath when her mother burst into the room and slammed the door shut, and her facial expression was completely expected. Margaret\u2019s eyes grew wide the moment she spotted the handprints on the back of Y/N\u2019s dress in the mirror. From that look on the woman\u2019s face, everyone nearly thought she might even pass out.<br/></p><p>\u201cMaisie! On your sister\u2019s big day, really?!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I \u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust because you didn\u2019t get a decent wedding, doesn\u2019t mean you can just let your daughter ruin Y/N\u2019s big day like this!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Layla\u2019s scream caused everyone to hold their tongues immediately to look at her. With both hands on her hips, she glared at the mother, then Maisie, and her best friend too. \u201cInstead of shouting and blaming each other, can we focus on how to take care of the not so little problem on Y/N\u2019s ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do anything about it.\u201d Maisie sighed.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe can splash white paint on it!\u201d<br/></p><p>Everyone looked at the little girl who seemed so proud of her idea. But instead of pinching her forehead like her mother or mumbling curse words like Layla, Y/N only burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane? How can you still laugh at a moment like this?\u201d Layla narrowed her eyes at the girl who was trying her best to hold it in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, really,\u201d Y/N said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure I can still walk down the aisle with red handprints on my ass.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ&hellip;\u201d The mother muttered under her breath and hurriedly left the room before she couldn\u2019t keep her patience anymore. Then Maisie followed as well, pulling Eleanor along so the little one couldn\u2019t cause any more problems.\u00a0</p><p>Now left alone with Y/N, Layla could finally raise her voice, \u201cfor once! I just want you to look perfect for once, Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N only giggled and hugged her friend tight.\u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI already feel perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you loved this dress&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI love Harry more,\u201d said the bride as she pulled away.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t care about my look. Don\u2019t you worry about me.\u201d<br/></p><p>Layla opened her mouth to argue just in time there was a knock on the door and Olivia stepped in, carrying the maid of honor gown. Without thinking twice, Layla marched towards the girl to take the dress for Y/N.<br/></p><p>\u201cHere, put this on. It\u2019s gonna be a bit uncomfortable around the waist but I think you\u2019ll manage.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut&hellip;What are you gonna wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my closet, bitch. You honestly think I don\u2019t have a plan B to Z?\u201d\u00a0said Layla as she turned to glare at Olivia.\u00a0\u201cBlondie, come tell Niall to bring me the backless satin dress. Just say that, he\u2019ll know which one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me\u00a0\u2018blondie\u2019?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d The maid-of-honor scoffed, lifting one eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cWould you prefer the other nickname?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0Olivia shook her head fast, a bit surprised because that was the very first time Layla had ever smiled at her. To be honest, it made her quite happy as well; and so she nodded fast and hurried out of the room to go inform the best man about the little situation.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Layla turned back to her best friend and gripped her shoulders, lips pressed together hard.\u00a0With a deep breath, she declared, \u201clet\u2019s make you perfect again.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cNiall, what are you doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHelping!\u201d</p><p>Harry reached up to touch the bowtie, but his best friend quickly slapped his hand away in an instant. Eyebrows furrowed, Niall tugged on the piece of fabric way too hard, making Harry tilt his head down and their foreheads bumped into each other.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, have you never done this before?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Have you ever seen me wear a tie?\u201d Niall scoffed, shaking his head, eyes fixed on the work as he mumbled, \u201cbut I swear to god it looked so easy on that youtube tutorial\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Harry huffed, raising his chin as he shouted loudly so his family waiting outside could hear him. \u201cGemma! Help! Mum! Anyone?\u201d</p><p>It took Gemma less than a second to burst in as if she knew they were gonna need her at one point. She pushed Niall away and took his place, glaring at both of the men.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ! You babies cannot do anything on your own!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me a baby, Gem. I\u2019m the one getting married.\u201d</p><p>The older sister exchanged amusing glances with Niall while shaking her head in response to Harry\u2019s slop-sided grin.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said. \u201cY/N is gonna baby you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! You\u2019re right. I won\u2019t ever have to grow up.\u201d</p><p>He giggled like a little boy when Gemma pulled away and rested both hands on her hips. As she gazed at him from head to toes, Harry opened his arms and spun around, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look, guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as good as me at my senior prom but I guess this will do,\u201d Niall teased, causing Harry to pick up the sock on the floor and toss it at him as both dissolved into laughter. Gemma could only watch them in silence while pinching her own forehead.</p><p>All of a sudden, the door to the changing room flew open and Anne rushed in, without saying a word first, she just walked straight to her son and pulled him into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, my sweet baby looks so good!\u201d She gushed, cupping his face and kissing his cheek like he was five, making Gemma toss her head back and groan.</p><p>\u201cMum, he\u2019s 24 years old!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh darling, he can be fifty and he\u2019s still my little baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re just mad because you\u2019re not the favorite child.\u201d Harry stuck out his tongue, making his sister scoff.</p><p>\u201cAt least, I\u2019m the smart child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s smarter. I get married first, I kind of win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho even made that rule?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhhh, the Styles and Niall all together again, a happy family,\u201d Niall interrupted the siblings as he walked over and grabbed Gemma by the hand, pulling her in to join the other two for a group hug. They rocked back and forth for a couple seconds then Harry began to laugh and tried to wiggle out of those tight arms locked around his torso.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are gonna mess up my look. I need space,\u201d he said, dusting off his clothes, making everyone laugh.</p><p>\u201cMum and I are gonna go check on the girls, okay? Please don\u2019t burn this place down.\u201d</p><p>Niall screwed up his face as he heard Gemma. \u201cHow are we gonna burn th\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou always find a way. That\u2019s what scares me.\u201d The woman rolled her eyes and took her mother\u2019s hand so they could both walk out together. But as soon as she reached the door, her litte brother spoke up fast, calling out her name.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She quickly turned around, raising an eyebrow at a beaming Harry.</p><p>\u201cHow does my baby look?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Laughing, she replied, \u201cso beautiful that you\u2019re gonna start sobbing at the altar.\u201d</p><p>That was all it took for Harry to start grinning from ear to ear. His heart was pounding and he had only imagined his bride in his head. How was he gonna stand on his own two feet when he actually watched her walk down the aisle? Of course she had always been the most beautiful princess to him, but today she was gonna be his queen.\u00a0</p><p>But no matter how overjoyed he was, Harry couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous somehow. His hands were shaking and he couldn\u2019t sit at one spot for over a minute. Now he was pacing back and forth in his dressing room, trying to remember his vow when he heard a knock on the door.</p><p><i>\u201cHaz, it\u2019s Ollie! Can I speak to Niall?\u201d</i><br/></p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow, exchanging looks with his best friend who didn\u2019t know why Olivia wanted to speak to him. But Harry told her to come in anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Shyly, the girl entered the room and explained the problem to the groom and his best man. As Harry freaked out because he was afraid Y/N might be sad about the dress, Niall, on the other hand, just fell about. He even joked,\u00a0\u201cI guess we could say little El was caught <i>red handed</i>!\u201d</p><p>Harry immediately smacked him on the arm, causing the blue-eyed man to bounce a step backward, groaning in pain.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you think that one hurts, wait until Layla punches you for not bringing her the dress on time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re right.\u201d Niall quickly grabbed his car key on the table and fled right out of the room. Less than a second later, he poked his head in and told Olivia to stay and assist Harry if he needed anything. Then he was gone in a heartbeat.<br/></p><p>Harry and Olivia exchanged awkward smiles behind the closed door as both came to sit down on the couch in the middle of them room, each at one end to stay as far from each other as possible. With her knees together and both hands resting on them, Olivia stole a glance at the man and noticed the tiny notes he was holding.</p><p>\u201cAre you&hellip;learning your vow?\u201d She asked softly, releasing a slight laugh to lighten up the mood.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah. I wrote it myself,\u201d he answered with a proud smile.<br/></p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She chuckled.\u00a0\u201cMay I see it?\u201d<br/></p><p>Nodding his head, Harry handed the notes to Olivia, who quickly read through them all, eyes squinted to make out a few words he\u2019d sloppily written in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cThis is so beautiful, Haz,\u201d she said at last.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He chuckled slightly, leaning aside as the dimples dug deeper into his cheeks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s gonna cry,\u201d she said, handing the notes back to him.\u00a0\u201cI know I would.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Harry knew nothing else to say so he inhaled deeply and released a shaky breath. The silence that followed was obviously awkward yet more comfortable than talking about the thing they should talk about, like everything that had gone wrong between them over the years. However, Olivia felt like if they wanted to save their friendship, she should take the initiative to say something now that she had her chance.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she blurted, making him freeze in confusion.<br/></p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFor&hellip;what I did.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt was a couple years ago.\u201d He chuckled, putting the note down so he could toy with the rings on his fingers to avoid looking into her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about it anymore.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut&hellip;I have been treating you like the same boy I used to know, when you\u2019re not that boy anymore,\u201d Olivia replied with a guilty grin.\u00a0\u201cI ruined our friendship, Haz. You used to be my second family, my real one actually&hellip;Now I\u2019ve got none and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d He shook his head. With a bit of hesitation, he thought for a few seconds before reaching out to hold her hand which was gripping the hem of her knee-length dress. \u201cI still care about you. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the same way you want me to but&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s&hellip;it\u2019s enough. As long as you still care about me, I&rsquo;m happy.\u201d She put her other hand ontop of his, giving it a squeeze as they held their gaze and shared a smile. It took her a moment to continue, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that things happened the way it did and I cannot be your best man like the promise we made years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, when I made that promise I didn\u2019t think I would ever get married,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes as both of them chuckled.\u00a0\u201cBut look at me now.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cLook at you now&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Without warning, Ben burst into the room, causing the two friends to rise up at the same time and turned to the breathless man standing with one hand on the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, boys!\u201d He announced with so much excitement, but the grin on his face faded as he looked from side to side. \u201cWait, where\u2019s Niall?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe came home to get Layla\u2019s dress?\u201d Harry said as Olivia fixed his bowtie again for him and both hurried out of the room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her dress?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLong story. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ben still lifted an eyebrow but he soon brushed his confusion aside and picked up his pace to catch up with the other two.</p><p>\u201cCan I fill in his place?\u201d He elated shouted, making Harry chortle.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was the answer.<br/></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry had a dream last night about how his wedding was going to be. He woke up with a bright smile on his face even with the lack of sleep because it was wonderful, truly beautiful. He remembered exactly how he was feeling as he stood at the altar in his dream. The room was full of pink clouds and there was only him standing there and watching his wife walk on the rose petals towards him, a bright smile on her gorgeous face. But even while dreaming, his heart was still beating like a drum and he was shaking with strong emotions.</p><p>Now, while standing at the real altar, hands held together as he took a deep breath when the music started to play, his adrenaline tripled and his heart fought to escape from his chest. Because he knew what was happening was real, not just a fantasy anymore. And just a couple seconds more, his beautiful Y/N would walk in and take his breath away.</p><p>Harry\u2019s impatience made those seconds felt like hours. His sweaty palms got so uncomfortable that he had to wipe them on his pants when all attention was no longer on him. But no matter how long he really had to wait, that moment did arrive.\u00a0</p><p>The big entrance finally opened wide, and Harry nearly held his breath. The small room with around thirty guests sank to silence. Harry mentally thanked God that they\u2019d decided to have a small wedding because he didn\u2019t have to be distracted by anything else to focus on his wife only.\u00a0</p><p>When he locked eyes with her for the first time at their wedding, it almost felt like the whole world disappeared. Now, reality wasn\u2019t so different from the dream he\u2019d had, just him and her and no one else like from the start. He almost forgot the fact that she wasn\u2019t wearing the fancy wedding dress she loved more than anything in the world, and he believed at that point she didn\u2019t really care either. Time seemed to pause and his brain started showing all the flashbacks from their very first met up to that very moment. Harry had been holding back his tears from the second the music started playing, but now his eyes had welled up and it only took him a second to start sniffing into his palm.\u00a0</p><p>The background song faded out as Y/N took his hand, facing him with tears shimmering in her eyes. He could see his mother blowing her nose in the little handkerchief she always carried around in her purse. Even Layla, whom he\u2019d never seen shed a tear was subtly wiping away the ones running down her cheek as she tried to not let it smudge her mascara.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear friends and family,\u201d the priest began when everyone had settled and the room sank to utter silence.\u00a0\u201cWe are gathered here today to witness and celebrate&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Harry could barely listen to what the man was saying because right now he only paid attention to his bride. With a Cheshire Cat grin, he mouthed to her &quot;you&rsquo;re beautiful&rdquo;, feeling his own heart flutter when she mouthed back &ldquo;so are you&rdquo; with an equally wide smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Psst, Harry&hellip;Harry!&rdquo; Niall slightly tugged on Harry&rsquo;s sleeve to grab his attention, making the couple break their loving eye contact to look at the priest who had one brow raised at the groom.</p><p>&ldquo;Your vow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shit.&rdquo; Harry quickly covered his mouth as everyone cracked up at his little accident. Blushing, he gave Anne a little wave. &ldquo;Sorry, mum,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your favorite child now right?&rdquo; Gemma whispered to her mother, who could only laugh and urged her son to continue.</p><p>Harry held up a finger, asking for a second as he searched in his pockets for the little notes he\u2019d written his vow on. But then he remembered he\u2019d left them all in his dressing room and his eyes nearly popped right out of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Y/N whispered when she saw the look on his face, but her man didn\u2019t have the heart to admit that he was too nervous he couldn\u2019t remember any part of the speech he\u2019d worked so hard on. The anxiety was burning him up just like that time he was waiting for her to come home to finally tell her \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time in person. Taking a deep breath, he reached out to hold one of her hand with both of his and bring it to his chest where his heart was. The voice inside his head told him that to say what he felt, like he was talking to her in private without any witness. The thought had calmed him down quite a bit now.</p><p>Eyes locked with hers, Harry cleared his throat and began,\u00a0\u201cY/N&hellip;you know I\u2019m not good with words so if my vow sucks, <i>please</i> don\u2019t cancel the wedding.\u201d Laughter filled the room, giving Harry more confidence to go on as he gripped her hand tighter and received a reassuring smile in response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe officially met the first time in a coffee shop on campus. From the first few words you said to me, I could tell you didn\u2019t like me very much, and I also thought to myself\u00a0\u2018god help me, am I gonna have to live with this person for the rest of my college years?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes as all the guests laughed again.</p><p>\u201c<i>But.</i>\u201d Harry shushed them by raising a finger.\u00a0\u201cI ended up falling madly in love with that girl whom I used to think was the most annoying girl I\u2019d ever met. Now, she\u2019s the most important woman in my life, right next to my mum.\u201d<br/></p><p>Gemma suddenly cleared her throat so Harry had to turn and glare right at her.</p><p>\u201c<i>And</i> my sister,\u201d he added, receiving a smirk from Gemma as she waved her hand for him to continue.<br/></p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he continued, smiling widely at the girl he loved.\u00a0\u201cI cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.\u201d</p><p>Someone in the back said <i>\u201caww\u201d</i> and Layla immediately shushed the woman so her friend could go on.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d Harry exhaled another smile. \u201cI vow to always be patient in our marriage because you\u2019ve always been\u00a0patient with me. I know it was frustrating to love someone who had no idea\u00a0what love was until he loved you. But somehow you never gave up on that boy, even though his foolishness often caused you headache and sometimes even made you cry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N lifted the bouquet in her other hand to cover half of her face but Harry could see her eyes glistened with tears and that was all it took for him to start crying again. But he still had to finish his vow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know they always said\u00a0\u2018til death do us part\u2019 at weddings, but I don\u2019t want that. If I had a thousand lifetimes, I\u2019d want to fall in love with you again a thousand times, because you\u2019re my soulmate. Baby, I vow to always love you, in this lifetime. And the next. And many after that. All over again. Forever and always.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Harry finished his vow, Layla released a sob so loud that got all eyes turned to her. The maid of honor mumbled an apology and looked away so no one could see her cry. Meanwhile, Ben, who was standing right beside Niall, tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, &ldquo;if I were you I would start writing my vow today.&rdquo; The warning caused the best man to anxiously blow up his cheeks and begin to think about what he was gonna say at his own wedding. Layla would never let him live with a vow second to his best friend&rsquo;s.</p><p>The priest told Y/N that it was her turn to speak her vow, and the girl exhaled sharply before wiping away her tears.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She breathed.\u00a0\u201cI thought it\u2019d be easy to beat you at giving an emotional vow but I guess I\u2019ve underestimated you.\u201d Harry shook his head no as the others chortled at her lovely humor.\u00a0\u201cOkay, here goes&hellip;\u201d</p><p>The room turned quiet in an instant so the bride could begin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;I know I\u2019ve said I love you so many times before and I bet you already know that. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever mentioned how much I adore you. Harry, you are such an amazing person, a great man who takes care of the ones he loves, who always know what to say and what to do, who\u2019s good at almost everything,&hellip;except for when he\u2019s with Niall.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Niall said and Harry shot him a glare, making all the guests roar with laughter.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve always been there for me, always loved me, and reminded me that I can be amazing and beautiful and great as anyone else.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou are, love,\u201d he mumbled to her and all the others sighed and aww\u2019ed at the same time.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo I think I must be the luckiest girl on the planet to be standing here with you today.\u201d She sniffed, quickly wiping off the tears at the corners of her eyes before her makeup was ruined. The hand that was holding his had never let go.\u00a0\u201cForever after, I vow to always be by your side through it all, to never give up on us and support you no matter what, just like what you\u2019ve been doing for us since day one. I vow to love you with all my heart and always be patient with you, always be true to you, always be loyal.\u201d Then she laughed softly.\u00a0\u201cI know this may sound silly, but I love to think that we\u2019re made from the same stardust, and when we die we\u2019ll go back to being the same star, because I cannot imagine being with anyone else other than you. I will love you always, from one lifetime to the next. You\u2019re my first love. And I cannot wait to make you my forever. &ldquo;<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Layla said to the lady at the front row who was sobbing just as hard as she was.<br/></p><p>\u201cRings, Niall!\u201d Harry turned to the best man who was too busy clapping his hands just like everyone else to remember his duty. Hurriedly, Niall pulled out the rings from his jacket, sighing in relief that he didn\u2019t drop them and happily handing the couple their rings so they could put them on for each other.<br/></p><p>&quot;And now, by the power vested in me, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife. You may now\u2014\u201d Without waiting for him to finish, Harry grabbed Y/N and kissed her hard on the mouth. All the guests rose from their seats to clap their hands and cheered for the newly weds.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&quot;Family and Friends, I present to you for the first time <i>Mr</i> and <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The wedding reception was meant to be a warm dinner between family and friends, but thanks to Niall&rsquo;s brilliant MC skills, everyone ended up moving all the tables and chairs to the sides so they could get up and dance. Y/N had long forgotten where she&rsquo;d left her heels, now was dancing on bare feet with Layla the the girls in the middle of the room, meanwhile Harry was held back by the men as they kept offering him drinks knowing he could never say no. The parents could only sit on the sidelines and carry on with their conversations about the couple\u2019s future as if they were the ones to decide how it was gonna be.</p><p>In a room full of bliss, Olivia had never felt more alone. So instead of standing in the corner the entire time, she quietly snuck out to the main hall for some fresh air while waiting for the celebration to be over. But as soon as she walked through the door, the girl stopped dead in her tracks when seeing the couple in the main lobby.</p><p>In the heat of the fight, Jack and his date didn&rsquo;t pay attention to her. Olivia knew it wasn\u2019t right to watch, still she was too curious to walk away. Of course she didn\u2019t know who the woman was and why she was shouting at Jack. But the guy seemed miserable over there, almost making her step forward to interfere. However, she didn\u2019t have to be his hero. Olivia heard Jack say something like a goodbye and an apology. And the woman, now with tears in her eyes, stormed straight to the main exit, leaving him behind with a massive frown upon his face.\u00a0</p><p>Olivia was now torn between walking over there to ask if he was alright, and walking away before he spotted her and thought she was being nosy (which wasn\u2019t exactly false). So she stood still, fidgeting for a few seconds when all of a sudden he turned his head, looking at her straight in the eyes. The girl freaked out and attempted to run, but she bumped into a table by accident and got the hem of her skirt stuck in it.</p><p>Jack tried not to laugh as he marched towards the damsel in distress and bent down to get her skirt out of the edge of the table, trying to be careful so he wouldn\u2019t damage the fabric.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she cursed, but soon noticed his reaction and mumbled a quick apology, making him chuckle.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou love ruining your own dresses, huh?\u201d He teased, leaving a huge grin on the girl\u2019s face.<br/></p><p>\u201cUhm&hellip;I didn\u2019t see you at the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;I skipped it on purpose.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause of your girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Her questioned made Jack raise an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cI&hellip;I don\u2019t know if she was really your girlfriend. I only guessed.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cShe <i>was</i>.\u201d He sighed, lifting his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cNot anymore. I think you just witnessed our break up.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Livy.\u201d<br/></p><p>Olivia\u2019s face brightened up at the nickname.\u00a0\u201cOh you remember my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name is not really hard to remember.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Jack\u2019s comment was followed up by a fit of laughter which instantly died down as soon as they made eye contact and turned away from each other.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out here?\u201d He asked the girl as the silence had become quite awkward.<br/></p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t have many friends here.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wedding, Livy, not high school.\u201d Jack chuckled and rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cCome in, I\u2019ll be your friend for the night. Then we\u2019ll dance our sorrow away.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t know if this man was joking about being sad or he was just very good at hiding his feelings, but maybe a made-believe happiness would work for her right now.</p><p>\u201cJust a warning, I\u2019m a terrible dancer,\u201d she told him, laughing slightly.<br/></p><p>With a smile, he said,\u00a0\u201cgreat, so am I.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N waved enthusiastically when she saw her boss, who put on a smile and opened his arms so she could go in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>That was actually the first proper embrace they\u2019d ever shared, and there was something heart-warming about it, probably because it was different from the time she hugged him as he\u2019d just lost his mother, or the time he held her in the lift as she had a panic attack. It was just a simple hug, which was why it was so special.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you at the ceremony?!\u201d Her face puckered up as she pulled away, holding his hands.\u00a0\u201cYou missed the best part!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry, I was busy.\u201d He smiled, yet she didn\u2019t seem too pleased with his answer.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always busy.\u201d<br/></p><p>The eye-roll she gave him only expanded his grin.\u00a0</p><p>The other day in the lift when they were alone, he almost got weak and told her he loved her. But now, seeing her this happy and full of life, he was glad he hadn\u2019t got a chance to say it. Some things were best kept to yourself.</p><p>Jack changed his mind about attending the wedding ceremony at the last minute because he couldn\u2019t imagine how he was going to witness the girl he loved say \u201cI do\u201d and become someone else\u2019s forever. That was why he got into a fight with Maria on the way to the wedding reception. Maria had asked him to tell her the truth, and he did, so she got mad and left. Despite so, he couldn\u2019t think of a better way they could\u2019ve ended the relationship which had been a fail from the start.\u00a0</p><p>Even though he\u2019d never actually thought about coming between Y/N and Harry, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he loved her. He was happy for her, yet he would\u2019ve been so broken had he actually listened to her vow. However, the sad truth about life was how you never got to choose whom you were gonna fall in love with, so if love came, you had to accept love, even if it didn\u2019t come to stay.\u00a0</p><p>Jack now had to accept the fact that he\u2019d fallen in love with someone who was untouchable, and his relationship with Maria had been a mistake. She was just looking for someone to possess, not to love; and he was just looking for someone to help him forget about Y/N. As it turned out, the only way for him to move on was to do let his heart heal on its own and not try to fill the void with something else other than love.</p><p>\u201cWait, where\u2019s the other dress?\u201d Jack asked after pulling away and by the way Y/N kept on giggling, he assumed she was a bit tipsy.<br/></p><p>\u201cMy niece left two red handprints on my ass.\u201d She laughed, raising her hands to demonstrate the action, cracking him up.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you still look good in this one.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She gave him a smile and twirled around so he could see the motion of the dress.\u00a0\u201cBut honestly I cannot eat because if I do, the zipper might burst. My best friend is super-model skinny.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t say anything but the smile on his face never faded as he watched her beam grow. Everyone in the room clapped their hands when the upbeat song ended, then all gathered to the middle of the room as Niall announced a slow song for the couples was next.</p><p>Y/N looked behind her boss with a confused look as she asked,\u00a0\u201cwhere\u2019s Maria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d he lied, curving his lips into a smile before pointing at Olivia standing by the wall.\u00a0\u201cBut I got myself a new dance partner, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Y/N giggled, giving the blonde across the room a little wave as she turned back to Jack.\u00a0\u201cAlso, I\u2019m very happy that you showed up.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He nodded, holding both of her shoulders firmly.\u00a0\u201cCongrats, Mrs. Styles.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied, giving him one last smile as she watched him return to Olivia. Maybe love didn\u2019t have to be a romantic bond between two people. Sometimes, it took form as a bond between two friends, who wanted nothing more than happiness for the other.<br/></p><p><i><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br/>You can feel it on the way home, way home</i></i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cWifey!\u201d</i><br/></p><p>Y/N turned around just in time Harry crashed into her arms, squeezing all the air out of his wife with that bear hug. She could guess how much he\u2019d drunk because he couldn\u2019t stop giggling like a little boy, and his happiness was so contagious that she couldn\u2019t help but laugh along. She pulled away a bit to hold his face with both hands. His arms tightened around her waist, keeping her pressed against him so he could whisper into her ear,\u00a0\u201cdance with me.\u201d</p><p><i><i>You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br/>You are in love, true love</i></i><br/></p><p>\u201cYou finally escaped from the boys, I see.\u201d Her arms came wrapped around his neck to start guiding them to the beat of the song.<br/></p><p>\u201cThey literally tried to drown me in vodka even after I\u2019d told them I needed to stay sober for you,\u201d he said in annoyance, making her giggle. \u201cIf I disappoint you tonight, it\u2019s because I wasted most of my energy on fighting them.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Morning, his place<br/>Burnt toast, Sunday<br/>You keep his shirt<br/>He keeps his word</i><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never disappointed me though.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAww that\u2019s the first lie you\u2019ve told me as my wife.\u201d<br/></p><p>She smacked him on the arm as both broke into a fit of laughter.</p><p><i>And for once you let go<br/>Of your fears and your ghosts<br/>One step, not much<br/>But it said enough</i><br/></p><p>Harry looked around the room and spotted in the far corner Y/N\u2019s two\u00a0friends from high school John and Violet slow dancing together. John held his pregnant wife like she was the most delicate thing in the world and the sight made Harry\u2019s heart flutter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to put a baby inside of you,\u201d he blurted, causing Y/N to guffaw.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh my god, are you gonna replace the word \u2018sex\u2019 with \u2018putting a baby inside of you\u2019 from now on?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He bit back a smile and pinched her side playfully.\u00a0\u201cI mean, I want to have a baby with you. A little us.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>You kiss on sidewalks<br/>You fight and you talk<br/></i><i><i>One night he wakes<br/></i></i><i><i>Strange look on his face</i></i><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been desperate for a baby since you found Treasure though.\u201d She rolled her eyes and joked,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you married me just to get a human baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen wanting to marry you since your brother\u2019s wedding actually.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Pauses, then says<br/>&quot;You&rsquo;re my best friend&rdquo;<br/>And you knew what it was<br/>He is in love</i><br/></p><p>His confession caused her to pull away a bit so they could lock eyes with one another. She stroked his cheeks tenderly and traced her fingertips across his pink lips. Smiling, she said,\u00a0\u201cnow that you mention, our first dance was at my brother\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and now we\u2019re dancing at our own. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p><i>So it goes<br/>You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round<br/>And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown<br/>And you understand now why they lost their minds<br/>And fought the wars<br/>And why I&rsquo;ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words</i><br/></p><p>\u201cDid you like my vow?\u201d He asked with a smug look on his face because he already knew the answer, but wanting to hear it from her still.<br/></p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it already obvious?\u201d She snorted. \u201cI weeped like a baby in front of you and everyone.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe only time I was happy that I made you cry.\u201d Harry sighed, stroking her sides gently. \u201cHey, baby, I just came up with something I should\u2019ve added to my vow.\u201d</p><p>Despite already knowing he was going to say something silly, she still nodded and told him to go on. Then with a funny high-pitched voice, he drunkenly sang,<i>\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re so sexy, you\u2019re so fine. I\u2019m gonna make you mah wife.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N tossed her head back as she laughed and cupped his face between her palms.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t put that in your vow. I would\u2019ve returned the ring and walked out immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re regretting this whole thing aren\u2019t you?\u201d He kissed her cheek, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Y/N flashed a smile and nodded her head quickly to play along with the joke.<br/></p><p>\u201cInstead of going back home after this, let\u2019s go get divorced,\u201d she playfully suggested. The pretentious hurt look on his face got her dying on laughter.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, but hold on, let me hold my wife a bit longer before she leaves me,\u201d said Harry as he kissed her forehead and pulled her in again, mouth at her ear when he whispered,\u00a0\u201clove you to the moon and back.\u201d</p><p>With butterflies going wild in her stomach, she also told him,\u00a0\u201cI love you too, forever and always, darling.\u201d</p><p><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br/>You can feel it on the way home, way home<br/>You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br/>You are in love, true love<br/>You are in love<br/></i></p>",

I can\u2019t believe\u00a0I\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>Letting out a soft laugh, Layla came to stand right behind her best friend in front of the full-length mirror. Now with her wedding dress on, Y/N looked like the prettiest princess from a story book, and the thought made Layla smile as they locked eyes in the mirror. Even if Y/N hadn\u2019t repeatedly mentioned how nervous she was, her ragged breathing would already have given herself away.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you\u2019d been ready for this day your whole life?\u201d Layla chuckled, crossing her arms as she watched a beam grow on the bride\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Y/N sucked in a breath.\u00a0\u201cIt was\u00a0easier to imagine.\u201d<br></p><p>Layla nodded slightly and stepped forward to wrap her arms around the maid-of-honor\u2019s waist, chin resting on her shoulder as they exchanged nonchalant smiles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d said the green-eyed girl.\u00a0\u201cKnowing that I\u2019ve been here with you guys from the start of it all makes me so emotional.\u201d<br></p><p>Her statement caused Y/N to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you kind of hated me at the beginning.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Layla laughed, rolling her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYour hideous outfits got on my nerves, no offence.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAunt Y/N!\u201d<br></p><p>The high-pitched voice got both girls to turn to the entrance when the little girl burst into the room and rushed towards the bride, hugging her tightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d Y/N bent down to hold the child by the arms.\u00a0\u201cHi, my love. Look at you in your tiny dress! Oh my god, you look like a little princess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, aunt Y/N. You look like a princess too!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEl, do not disturb your aunt!\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N looked up to find her sister standing at the door. As Maisie marched forward to grab the little girl, Y/N pulled Eleanor close to her chest .\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Maisie. I\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should already be done right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still pretty earl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLayla!\u201d Y/N stood up fast and turned to her best friend.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t say that in front of El!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your skirt!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Layla quickly grabbed Y/N by the shoulders and dragged her to the mirror so she could see the big problem for herself. Two red handprints stood out on the white fabric and could be seen from miles away let alone up close. Y/N tugged on the skirt of her dress in shock, for a second completely speechless and freaked out by the reflection in the mirror.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d Maisie shouted, forcing her daughter to show both of her hands.\u00a0\u201cOh god, were you just messing with those paint buckets in the lobby?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no, sis, it\u2019s fine! Don\u2019t yell at her!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFine?!\u201d Layla cried out.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got red handprints on your ass! How the fuck is <i>this</i> fine?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWho got what on her ass now?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d Y/N cursed under her breath when her mother burst into the room and slammed the door shut, and her facial expression was completely expected. Margaret\u2019s eyes grew wide the moment she spotted the handprints on the back of Y/N\u2019s dress in the mirror. From that look on the woman\u2019s face, everyone nearly thought she might even pass out.<br></p><p>\u201cMaisie! On your sister\u2019s big day, really?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I \u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust because you didn\u2019t get a decent wedding, doesn\u2019t mean you can just let your daughter ruin Y/N\u2019s big day like this!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Layla\u2019s scream caused everyone to hold their tongues immediately to look at her. With both hands on her hips, she glared at the mother, then Maisie, and her best friend too. \u201cInstead of shouting and blaming each other, can we focus on how to take care of the not so little problem on Y/N\u2019s ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do anything about it.\u201d Maisie sighed.<br></p><p>\u201cWe can splash white paint on it!\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone looked at the little girl who seemed so proud of her idea. But instead of pinching her forehead like her mother or mumbling curse words like Layla, Y/N only burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane? How can you still laugh at a moment like this?\u201d Layla narrowed her eyes at the girl who was trying her best to hold it in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, really,\u201d Y/N said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure I can still walk down the aisle with red handprints on my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ\u2026\u201d The mother muttered under her breath and hurriedly left the room before she couldn\u2019t keep her patience anymore. Then Maisie followed as well, pulling Eleanor along so the little one couldn\u2019t cause any more problems.\u00a0</p><p>Now left alone with Y/N, Layla could finally raise her voice, \u201cfor once! I just want you to look perfect for once, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Y/N only giggled and hugged her friend tight.\u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI already feel perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you loved this dress\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI love Harry more,\u201d said the bride as she pulled away.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t care about my look. Don\u2019t you worry about me.\u201d<br></p><p>Layla opened her mouth to argue just in time there was a knock on the door and Olivia stepped in, carrying the maid of honor gown. Without thinking twice, Layla marched towards the girl to take the dress for Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cHere, put this on. It\u2019s gonna be a bit uncomfortable around the waist but I think you\u2019ll manage.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026What are you gonna wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my closet, bitch. You honestly think I don\u2019t have a plan B to Z?\u201d\u00a0said Layla as she turned to glare at Olivia.\u00a0\u201cBlondie, come tell Niall to bring me the backless satin dress. Just say that, he\u2019ll know which one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me\u00a0\u2018blondie\u2019?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d The maid-of-honor scoffed, lifting one eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cWould you prefer the other nickname?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0Olivia shook her head fast, a bit surprised because that was the very first time Layla had ever smiled at her. To be honest, it made her quite happy as well; and so she nodded fast and hurried out of the room to go inform the best man about the little situation.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Layla turned back to her best friend and gripped her shoulders, lips pressed together hard.\u00a0With a deep breath, she declared, \u201clet\u2019s make you perfect again.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cNiall, what are you doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHelping!\u201d</p><p>Harry reached up to touch the bowtie, but his best friend quickly slapped his hand away in an instant. Eyebrows furrowed, Niall tugged on the piece of fabric way too hard, making Harry tilt his head down and their foreheads bumped into each other.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, have you never done this before?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Have you ever seen me wear a tie?\u201d Niall scoffed, shaking his head, eyes fixed on the work as he mumbled, \u201cbut I swear to god it looked so easy on that youtube tutorial\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Harry huffed, raising his chin as he shouted loudly so his family waiting outside could hear him. \u201cGemma! Help! Mum! Anyone?\u201d</p><p>It took Gemma less than a second to burst in as if she knew they were gonna need her at one point. She pushed Niall away and took his place, glaring at both of the men.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ! You babies cannot do anything on your own!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me a baby, Gem. I\u2019m the one getting married.\u201d</p><p>The older sister exchanged amusing glances with Niall while shaking her head in response to Harry\u2019s slop-sided grin.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said. \u201cY/N is gonna baby you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! You\u2019re right. I won\u2019t ever have to grow up.\u201d</p><p>He giggled like a little boy when Gemma pulled away and rested both hands on her hips. As she gazed at him from head to toes, Harry opened his arms and spun around, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look, guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as good as me at my senior prom but I guess this will do,\u201d Niall teased, causing Harry to pick up the sock on the floor and toss it at him as both dissolved into laughter. Gemma could only watch them in silence while pinching her own forehead.</p><p>All of a sudden, the door to the changing room flew open and Anne rushed in, without saying a word first, she just walked straight to her son and pulled him into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, my sweet baby looks so good!\u201d She gushed, cupping his face and kissing his cheek like he was five, making Gemma toss her head back and groan.</p><p>\u201cMum, he\u2019s 24 years old!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh darling, he can be fifty and he\u2019s still my little baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re just mad because you\u2019re not the favorite child.\u201d Harry stuck out his tongue, making his sister scoff.</p><p>\u201cAt least, I\u2019m the smart child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s smarter. I get married first, I kind of win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho even made that rule?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhhh, the Styles and Niall all together again, a happy family,\u201d Niall interrupted the siblings as he walked over and grabbed Gemma by the hand, pulling her in to join the other two for a group hug. They rocked back and forth for a couple seconds then Harry began to laugh and tried to wiggle out of those tight arms locked around his torso.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are gonna mess up my look. I need space,\u201d he said, dusting off his clothes, making everyone laugh.</p><p>\u201cMum and I are gonna go check on the girls, okay? Please don\u2019t burn this place down.\u201d</p><p>Niall screwed up his face as he heard Gemma. \u201cHow are we gonna burn th\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou always find a way. That\u2019s what scares me.\u201d The woman rolled her eyes and took her mother\u2019s hand so they could both walk out together. But as soon as she reached the door, her litte brother spoke up fast, calling out her name.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She quickly turned around, raising an eyebrow at a beaming Harry.</p><p>\u201cHow does my baby look?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Laughing, she replied, \u201cso beautiful that you\u2019re gonna start sobbing at the altar.\u201d</p><p>That was all it took for Harry to start grinning from ear to ear. His heart was pounding and he had only imagined his bride in his head. How was he gonna stand on his own two feet when he actually watched her walk down the aisle? Of course she had always been the most beautiful princess to him, but today she was gonna be his queen.\u00a0</p><p>But no matter how overjoyed he was, Harry couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous somehow. His hands were shaking and he couldn\u2019t sit at one spot for over a minute. Now he was pacing back and forth in his dressing room, trying to remember his vow when he heard a knock on the door.</p><p><i>\u201cHaz, it\u2019s Ollie! Can I speak to Niall?\u201d</i><br></p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow, exchanging looks with his best friend who didn\u2019t know why Olivia wanted to speak to him. But Harry told her to come in anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Shyly, the girl entered the room and explained the problem to the groom and his best man. As Harry freaked out because he was afraid Y/N might be sad about the dress, Niall, on the other hand, just fell about. He even joked,\u00a0\u201cI guess we could say little El was caught <i>red handed</i>!\u201d</p><p>Harry immediately smacked him on the arm, causing the blue-eyed man to bounce a step backward, groaning in pain.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you think that one hurts, wait until Layla punches you for not bringing her the dress on time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re right.\u201d Niall quickly grabbed his car key on the table and fled right out of the room. Less than a second later, he poked his head in and told Olivia to stay and assist Harry if he needed anything. Then he was gone in a heartbeat.<br></p><p>Harry and Olivia exchanged awkward smiles behind the closed door as both came to sit down on the couch in the middle of them room, each at one end to stay as far from each other as possible. With her knees together and both hands resting on them, Olivia stole a glance at the man and noticed the tiny notes he was holding.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2026learning your vow?\u201d She asked softly, releasing a slight laugh to lighten up the mood.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. I wrote it myself,\u201d he answered with a proud smile.<br></p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She chuckled.\u00a0\u201cMay I see it?\u201d<br></p><p>Nodding his head, Harry handed the notes to Olivia, who quickly read through them all, eyes squinted to make out a few words he\u2019d sloppily written in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cThis is so beautiful, Haz,\u201d she said at last.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He chuckled slightly, leaning aside as the dimples dug deeper into his cheeks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s gonna cry,\u201d she said, handing the notes back to him.\u00a0\u201cI know I would.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Harry knew nothing else to say so he inhaled deeply and released a shaky breath. The silence that followed was obviously awkward yet more comfortable than talking about the thing they should talk about, like everything that had gone wrong between them over the years. However, Olivia felt like if they wanted to save their friendship, she should take the initiative to say something now that she had her chance.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she blurted, making him freeze in confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor\u2026what I did.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt was a couple years ago.\u201d He chuckled, putting the note down so he could toy with the rings on his fingers to avoid looking into her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about it anymore.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026I have been treating you like the same boy I used to know, when you\u2019re not that boy anymore,\u201d Olivia replied with a guilty grin.\u00a0\u201cI ruined our friendship, Haz. You used to be my second family, my real one actually\u2026Now I\u2019ve got none and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d He shook his head. With a bit of hesitation, he thought for a few seconds before reaching out to hold her hand which was gripping the hem of her knee-length dress. \u201cI still care about you. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the same way you want me to but\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s enough. As long as you still care about me, I\u2019m happy.\u201d She put her other hand ontop of his, giving it a squeeze as they held their gaze and shared a smile. It took her a moment to continue, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that things happened the way it did and I cannot be your best man like the promise we made years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, when I made that promise I didn\u2019t think I would ever get married,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes as both of them chuckled.\u00a0\u201cBut look at me now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cLook at you now\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Without warning, Ben burst into the room, causing the two friends to rise up at the same time and turned to the breathless man standing with one hand on the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, boys!\u201d He announced with so much excitement, but the grin on his face faded as he looked from side to side. \u201cWait, where\u2019s Niall?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe came home to get Layla\u2019s dress?\u201d Harry said as Olivia fixed his bowtie again for him and both hurried out of the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her dress?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLong story. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ben still lifted an eyebrow but he soon brushed his confusion aside and picked up his pace to catch up with the other two.</p><p>\u201cCan I fill in his place?\u201d He elated shouted, making Harry chortle.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was the answer.<br></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry had a dream last night about how his wedding was going to be. He woke up with a bright smile on his face even with the lack of sleep because it was wonderful, truly beautiful. He remembered exactly how he was feeling as he stood at the altar in his dream. The room was full of pink clouds and there was only him standing there and watching his wife walk on the rose petals towards him, a bright smile on her gorgeous face. But even while dreaming, his heart was still beating like a drum and he was shaking with strong emotions.</p><p>Now, while standing at the real altar, hands held together as he took a deep breath when the music started to play, his adrenaline tripled and his heart fought to escape from his chest. Because he knew what was happening was real, not just a fantasy anymore. And just a couple seconds more, his beautiful Y/N would walk in and take his breath away.</p><p>Harry\u2019s impatience made those seconds felt like hours. His sweaty palms got so uncomfortable that he had to wipe them on his pants when all attention was no longer on him. But no matter how long he really had to wait, that moment did arrive.\u00a0</p><p>The big entrance finally opened wide, and Harry nearly held his breath. The small room with around thirty guests sank to silence. Harry mentally thanked God that they\u2019d decided to have a small wedding because he didn\u2019t have to be distracted by anything else to focus on his wife only.\u00a0</p><p>When he locked eyes with her for the first time at their wedding, it almost felt like the whole world disappeared. Now, reality wasn\u2019t so different from the dream he\u2019d had, just him and her and no one else like from the start. He almost forgot the fact that she wasn\u2019t wearing the fancy wedding dress she loved more than anything in the world, and he believed at that point she didn\u2019t really care either. Time seemed to pause and his brain started showing all the flashbacks from their very first met up to that very moment. Harry had been holding back his tears from the second the music started playing, but now his eyes had welled up and it only took him a second to start sniffing into his palm.\u00a0</p><p>The background song faded out as Y/N took his hand, facing him with tears shimmering in her eyes. He could see his mother blowing her nose in the little handkerchief she always carried around in her purse. Even Layla, whom he\u2019d never seen shed a tear was subtly wiping away the ones running down her cheek as she tried to not let it smudge her mascara.</p><p>\u201cDear friends and family,\u201d the priest began when everyone had settled and the room sank to utter silence.\u00a0\u201cWe are gathered here today to witness and celebrate\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry could barely listen to what the man was saying because right now he only paid attention to his bride. With a Cheshire Cat grin, he mouthed to her \"you\u2019re beautiful\u201d, feeling his own heart flutter when she mouthed back \u201cso are you\u201d with an equally wide smile.</p><p>\u201cPsst, Harry\u2026Harry!\u201d Niall slightly tugged on Harry\u2019s sleeve to grab his attention, making the couple break their loving eye contact to look at the priest who had one brow raised at the groom.</p><p>\u201cYour vow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Harry quickly covered his mouth as everyone cracked up at his little accident. Blushing, he gave Anne a little wave. \u201cSorry, mum,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your favorite child now right?\u201d Gemma whispered to her mother, who could only laugh and urged her son to continue.</p><p>Harry held up a finger, asking for a second as he searched in his pockets for the little notes he\u2019d written his vow on. But then he remembered he\u2019d left them all in his dressing room and his eyes nearly popped right out of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Y/N whispered when she saw the look on his face, but her man didn\u2019t have the heart to admit that he was too nervous he couldn\u2019t remember any part of the speech he\u2019d worked so hard on. The anxiety was burning him up just like that time he was waiting for her to come home to finally tell her \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time in person. Taking a deep breath, he reached out to hold one of her hand with both of his and bring it to his chest where his heart was. The voice inside his head told him that to say what he felt, like he was talking to her in private without any witness. The thought had calmed him down quite a bit now.</p><p>Eyes locked with hers, Harry cleared his throat and began,\u00a0\u201cY/N\u2026you know I\u2019m not good with words so if my vow sucks, <i>please</i> don\u2019t cancel the wedding.\u201d Laughter filled the room, giving Harry more confidence to go on as he gripped her hand tighter and received a reassuring smile in response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe officially met the first time in a coffee shop on campus. From the first few words you said to me, I could tell you didn\u2019t like me very much, and I also thought to myself\u00a0\u2018god help me, am I gonna have to live with this person for the rest of my college years?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes as all the guests laughed again.</p><p>\u201c<i>But.</i>\u201d Harry shushed them by raising a finger.\u00a0\u201cI ended up falling madly in love with that girl whom I used to think was the most annoying girl I\u2019d ever met. Now, she\u2019s the most important woman in my life, right next to my mum.\u201d<br></p><p>Gemma suddenly cleared her throat so Harry had to turn and glare right at her.</p><p>\u201c<i>And</i> my sister,\u201d he added, receiving a smirk from Gemma as she waved her hand for him to continue.<br></p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he continued, smiling widely at the girl he loved.\u00a0\u201cI cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.\u201d</p><p>Someone in the back said <i>\u201caww\u201d</i> and Layla immediately shushed the woman so her friend could go on.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d Harry exhaled another smile. \u201cI vow to always be patient in our marriage because you\u2019ve always been\u00a0patient with me. I know it was frustrating to love someone who had no idea\u00a0what love was until he loved you. But somehow you never gave up on that boy, even though his foolishness often caused you headache and sometimes even made you cry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N lifted the bouquet in her other hand to cover half of her face but Harry could see her eyes glistened with tears and that was all it took for him to start crying again. But he still had to finish his vow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know they always said\u00a0\u2018til death do us part\u2019 at weddings, but I don\u2019t want that. If I had a thousand lifetimes, I\u2019d want to fall in love with you again a thousand times, because you\u2019re my soulmate. Baby, I vow to always love you, in this lifetime. And the next. And many after that. All over again. Forever and always.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Harry finished his vow, Layla released a sob so loud that got all eyes turned to her. The maid of honor mumbled an apology and looked away so no one could see her cry. Meanwhile, Ben, who was standing right beside Niall, tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, \u201cif I were you I would start writing my vow today.\u201d The warning caused the best man to anxiously blow up his cheeks and begin to think about what he was gonna say at his own wedding. Layla would never let him live with a vow second to his best friend\u2019s.</p><p>The priest told Y/N that it was her turn to speak her vow, and the girl exhaled sharply before wiping away her tears.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She breathed.\u00a0\u201cI thought it\u2019d be easy to beat you at giving an emotional vow but I guess I\u2019ve underestimated you.\u201d Harry shook his head no as the others chortled at her lovely humor.\u00a0\u201cOkay, here goes\u2026\u201d</p><p>The room turned quiet in an instant so the bride could begin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I know I\u2019ve said I love you so many times before and I bet you already know that. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever mentioned how much I adore you. Harry, you are such an amazing person, a great man who takes care of the ones he loves, who always know what to say and what to do, who\u2019s good at almost everything,\u2026except for when he\u2019s with Niall.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Niall said and Harry shot him a glare, making all the guests roar with laughter.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve always been there for me, always loved me, and reminded me that I can be amazing and beautiful and great as anyone else.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou are, love,\u201d he mumbled to her and all the others sighed and aww\u2019ed at the same time.<br></p><p>\u201cSo I think I must be the luckiest girl on the planet to be standing here with you today.\u201d She sniffed, quickly wiping off the tears at the corners of her eyes before her makeup was ruined. The hand that was holding his had never let go.\u00a0\u201cForever after, I vow to always be by your side through it all, to never give up on us and support you no matter what, just like what you\u2019ve been doing for us since day one. I vow to love you with all my heart and always be patient with you, always be true to you, always be loyal.\u201d Then she laughed softly.\u00a0\u201cI know this may sound silly, but I love to think that we\u2019re made from the same stardust, and when we die we\u2019ll go back to being the same star, because I cannot imagine being with anyone else other than you. I will love you always, from one lifetime to the next. You\u2019re my first love. And I cannot wait to make you my forever. \u201c<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Layla said to the lady at the front row who was sobbing just as hard as she was.<br></p><p>\u201cRings, Niall!\u201d Harry turned to the best man who was too busy clapping his hands just like everyone else to remember his duty. Hurriedly, Niall pulled out the rings from his jacket, sighing in relief that he didn\u2019t drop them and happily handing the couple their rings so they could put them on for each other.<br></p><p>\"And now, by the power vested in me, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife. You may now\u2014\u201d Without waiting for him to finish, Harry grabbed Y/N and kissed her hard on the mouth. All the guests rose from their seats to clap their hands and cheered for the newly weds.\u00a0<br></p><p>\"Family and Friends, I present to you for the first time <i>Mr</i> and <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The wedding reception was meant to be a warm dinner between family and friends, but thanks to Niall\u2019s brilliant MC skills, everyone ended up moving all the tables and chairs to the sides so they could get up and dance. Y/N had long forgotten where she\u2019d left her heels, now was dancing on bare feet with Layla the the girls in the middle of the room, meanwhile Harry was held back by the men as they kept offering him drinks knowing he could never say no. The parents could only sit on the sidelines and carry on with their conversations about the couple\u2019s future as if they were the ones to decide how it was gonna be.</p><p>In a room full of bliss, Olivia had never felt more alone. So instead of standing in the corner the entire time, she quietly snuck out to the main hall for some fresh air while waiting for the celebration to be over. But as soon as she walked through the door, the girl stopped dead in her tracks when seeing the couple in the main lobby.</p><p>In the heat of the fight, Jack and his date didn\u2019t pay attention to her. Olivia knew it wasn\u2019t right to watch, still she was too curious to walk away. Of course she didn\u2019t know who the woman was and why she was shouting at Jack. But the guy seemed miserable over there, almost making her step forward to interfere. However, she didn\u2019t have to be his hero. Olivia heard Jack say something like a goodbye and an apology. And the woman, now with tears in her eyes, stormed straight to the main exit, leaving him behind with a massive frown upon his face.\u00a0</p><p>Olivia was now torn between walking over there to ask if he was alright, and walking away before he spotted her and thought she was being nosy (which wasn\u2019t exactly false). So she stood still, fidgeting for a few seconds when all of a sudden he turned his head, looking at her straight in the eyes. The girl freaked out and attempted to run, but she bumped into a table by accident and got the hem of her skirt stuck in it.</p><p>Jack tried not to laugh as he marched towards the damsel in distress and bent down to get her skirt out of the edge of the table, trying to be careful so he wouldn\u2019t damage the fabric.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she cursed, but soon noticed his reaction and mumbled a quick apology, making him chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cYou love ruining your own dresses, huh?\u201d He teased, leaving a huge grin on the girl\u2019s face.<br></p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026I didn\u2019t see you at the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026I skipped it on purpose.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause of your girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Her questioned made Jack raise an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know if she was really your girlfriend. I only guessed.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe <i>was</i>.\u201d He sighed, lifting his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cNot anymore. I think you just witnessed our break up.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Livy.\u201d<br></p><p>Olivia\u2019s face brightened up at the nickname.\u00a0\u201cOh you remember my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name is not really hard to remember.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Jack\u2019s comment was followed up by a fit of laughter which instantly died down as soon as they made eye contact and turned away from each other.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out here?\u201d He asked the girl as the silence had become quite awkward.<br></p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t have many friends here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wedding, Livy, not high school.\u201d Jack chuckled and rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cCome in, I\u2019ll be your friend for the night. Then we\u2019ll dance our sorrow away.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t know if this man was joking about being sad or he was just very good at hiding his feelings, but maybe a made-believe happiness would work for her right now.</p><p>\u201cJust a warning, I\u2019m a terrible dancer,\u201d she told him, laughing slightly.<br></p><p>With a smile, he said,\u00a0\u201cgreat, so am I.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N waved enthusiastically when she saw her boss, who put on a smile and opened his arms so she could go in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>That was actually the first proper embrace they\u2019d ever shared, and there was something heart-warming about it, probably because it was different from the time she hugged him as he\u2019d just lost his mother, or the time he held her in the lift as she had a panic attack. It was just a simple hug, which was why it was so special.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you at the ceremony?!\u201d Her face puckered up as she pulled away, holding his hands.\u00a0\u201cYou missed the best part!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, I was busy.\u201d He smiled, yet she didn\u2019t seem too pleased with his answer.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always busy.\u201d<br></p><p>The eye-roll she gave him only expanded his grin.\u00a0</p><p>The other day in the lift when they were alone, he almost got weak and told her he loved her. But now, seeing her this happy and full of life, he was glad he hadn\u2019t got a chance to say it. Some things were best kept to yourself.</p><p>Jack changed his mind about attending the wedding ceremony at the last minute because he couldn\u2019t imagine how he was going to witness the girl he loved say \u201cI do\u201d and become someone else\u2019s forever. That was why he got into a fight with Maria on the way to the wedding reception. Maria had asked him to tell her the truth, and he did, so she got mad and left. Despite so, he couldn\u2019t think of a better way they could\u2019ve ended the relationship which had been a fail from the start.\u00a0</p><p>Even though he\u2019d never actually thought about coming between Y/N and Harry, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he loved her. He was happy for her, yet he would\u2019ve been so broken had he actually listened to her vow. However, the sad truth about life was how you never got to choose whom you were gonna fall in love with, so if love came, you had to accept love, even if it didn\u2019t come to stay.\u00a0</p><p>Jack now had to accept the fact that he\u2019d fallen in love with someone who was untouchable, and his relationship with Maria had been a mistake. She was just looking for someone to possess, not to love; and he was just looking for someone to help him forget about Y/N. As it turned out, the only way for him to move on was to do let his heart heal on its own and not try to fill the void with something else other than love.</p><p>\u201cWait, where\u2019s the other dress?\u201d Jack asked after pulling away and by the way Y/N kept on giggling, he assumed she was a bit tipsy.<br></p><p>\u201cMy niece left two red handprints on my ass.\u201d She laughed, raising her hands to demonstrate the action, cracking him up.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you still look good in this one.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She gave him a smile and twirled around so he could see the motion of the dress.\u00a0\u201cBut honestly I cannot eat because if I do, the zipper might burst. My best friend is super-model skinny.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t say anything but the smile on his face never faded as he watched her beam grow. Everyone in the room clapped their hands when the upbeat song ended, then all gathered to the middle of the room as Niall announced a slow song for the couples was next.</p><p>Y/N looked behind her boss with a confused look as she asked,\u00a0\u201cwhere\u2019s Maria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d he lied, curving his lips into a smile before pointing at Olivia standing by the wall.\u00a0\u201cBut I got myself a new dance partner, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Y/N giggled, giving the blonde across the room a little wave as she turned back to Jack.\u00a0\u201cAlso, I\u2019m very happy that you showed up.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He nodded, holding both of her shoulders firmly.\u00a0\u201cCongrats, Mrs. Styles.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied, giving him one last smile as she watched him return to Olivia. Maybe love didn\u2019t have to be a romantic bond between two people. Sometimes, it took form as a bond between two friends, who wanted nothing more than happiness for the other.<br></p><p><i><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br>You can feel it on the way home, way home</i></i><br></p><p><i>\u201cWifey!\u201d</i><br></p><p>Y/N turned around just in time Harry crashed into her arms, squeezing all the air out of his wife with that bear hug. She could guess how much he\u2019d drunk because he couldn\u2019t stop giggling like a little boy, and his happiness was so contagious that she couldn\u2019t help but laugh along. She pulled away a bit to hold his face with both hands. His arms tightened around her waist, keeping her pressed against him so he could whisper into her ear,\u00a0\u201cdance with me.\u201d</p><p><i><i>You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br>You are in love, true love</i></i><br></p><p>\u201cYou finally escaped from the boys, I see.\u201d Her arms came wrapped around his neck to start guiding them to the beat of the song.<br></p><p>\u201cThey literally tried to drown me in vodka even after I\u2019d told them I needed to stay sober for you,\u201d he said in annoyance, making her giggle. \u201cIf I disappoint you tonight, it\u2019s because I wasted most of my energy on fighting them.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Morning, his place<br>Burnt toast, Sunday<br>You keep his shirt<br>He keeps his word</i><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never disappointed me though.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAww that\u2019s the first lie you\u2019ve told me as my wife.\u201d<br></p><p>She smacked him on the arm as both broke into a fit of laughter.</p><p><i>And for once you let go<br>Of your fears and your ghosts<br>One step, not much<br>But it said enough</i><br></p><p>Harry looked around the room and spotted in the far corner Y/N\u2019s two\u00a0friends from high school John and Violet slow dancing together. John held his pregnant wife like she was the most delicate thing in the world and the sight made Harry\u2019s heart flutter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to put a baby inside of you,\u201d he blurted, causing Y/N to guffaw.<br></p><p>\u201cOh my god, are you gonna replace the word \u2018sex\u2019 with \u2018putting a baby inside of you\u2019 from now on?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He bit back a smile and pinched her side playfully.\u00a0\u201cI mean, I want to have a baby with you. A little us.\u201d<br></p><p><i>You kiss on sidewalks<br>You fight and you talk<br></i><i><i>One night he wakes<br></i></i><i><i>Strange look on his face</i></i><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been desperate for a baby since you found Treasure though.\u201d She rolled her eyes and joked,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you married me just to get a human baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen wanting to marry you since your brother\u2019s wedding actually.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Pauses, then says<br>\"You\u2019re my best friend\u201d<br>And you knew what it was<br>He is in love</i><br></p><p>His confession caused her to pull away a bit so they could lock eyes with one another. She stroked his cheeks tenderly and traced her fingertips across his pink lips. Smiling, she said,\u00a0\u201cnow that you mention, our first dance was at my brother\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and now we\u2019re dancing at our own. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p><i>So it goes<br>You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round<br>And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown<br>And you understand now why they lost their minds<br>And fought the wars<br>And why I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words</i><br></p><p>\u201cDid you like my vow?\u201d He asked with a smug look on his face because he already knew the answer, but wanting to hear it from her still.<br></p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it already obvious?\u201d She snorted. \u201cI weeped like a baby in front of you and everyone.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe only time I was happy that I made you cry.\u201d Harry sighed, stroking her sides gently. \u201cHey, baby, I just came up with something I should\u2019ve added to my vow.\u201d</p><p>Despite already knowing he was going to say something silly, she still nodded and told him to go on. Then with a funny high-pitched voice, he drunkenly sang,<i>\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re so sexy, you\u2019re so fine. I\u2019m gonna make you mah wife.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N tossed her head back as she laughed and cupped his face between her palms.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t put that in your vow. I would\u2019ve returned the ring and walked out immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re regretting this whole thing aren\u2019t you?\u201d He kissed her cheek, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Y/N flashed a smile and nodded her head quickly to play along with the joke.<br></p><p>\u201cInstead of going back home after this, let\u2019s go get divorced,\u201d she playfully suggested. The pretentious hurt look on his face got her dying on laughter.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, but hold on, let me hold my wife a bit longer before she leaves me,\u201d said Harry as he kissed her forehead and pulled her in again, mouth at her ear when he whispered,\u00a0\u201clove you to the moon and back.\u201d</p><p>With butterflies going wild in her stomach, she also told him,\u00a0\u201cI love you too, forever and always, darling.\u201d</p><p><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br>You can feel it on the way home, way home<br>You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br>You are in love, true love<br>You are in love<br></i></p></p>",

Even if Y/N hadn\u2019t repeatedly mentioned how nervous she was, her ragged breathing would already have given herself away.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you\u2019d been ready for this day your whole life?\u201d Layla chuckled, crossing her arms as she watched a beam grow on the bride\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Y/N sucked in a breath.\u00a0\u201cIt was\u00a0easier to imagine.\u201d<br></p><p>Layla nodded slightly and stepped forward to wrap her arms around the maid-of-honor\u2019s waist, chin resting on her shoulder as they exchanged nonchalant smiles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d said the green-eyed girl.\u00a0\u201cKnowing that I\u2019ve been here with you guys from the start of it all makes me so emotional.\u201d<br></p><p>Her statement caused Y/N to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you kind of hated me at the beginning.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Layla laughed, rolling her eyes.\u00a0\u201cYour hideous outfits got on my nerves, no offence.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAunt Y/N!\u201d<br></p><p>The high-pitched voice got both girls to turn to the entrance when the little girl burst into the room and rushed towards the bride, hugging her tightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d Y/N bent down to hold the child by the arms.\u00a0\u201cHi, my love. Look at you in your tiny dress! Oh my god, you look like a little princess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, aunt Y/N. You look like a princess too!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEl, do not disturb your aunt!\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N looked up to find her sister standing at the door. As Maisie marched forward to grab the little girl, Y/N pulled Eleanor close to her chest .\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Maisie. I\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should already be done right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still pretty earl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLayla!\u201d Y/N stood up fast and turned to her best friend.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t say that in front of El!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your skirt!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Layla quickly grabbed Y/N by the shoulders and dragged her to the mirror so she could see the big problem for herself. Two red handprints stood out on the white fabric and could be seen from miles away let alone up close. Y/N tugged on the skirt of her dress in shock, for a second completely speechless and freaked out by the reflection in the mirror.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d Maisie shouted, forcing her daughter to show both of her hands.\u00a0\u201cOh god, were you just messing with those paint buckets in the lobby?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no, sis, it\u2019s fine! Don\u2019t yell at her!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFine?!\u201d Layla cried out.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got red handprints on your ass! How the fuck is <i>this</i> fine?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWho got what on her ass now?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d Y/N cursed under her breath when her mother burst into the room and slammed the door shut, and her facial expression was completely expected. Margaret\u2019s eyes grew wide the moment she spotted the handprints on the back of Y/N\u2019s dress in the mirror. From that look on the woman\u2019s face, everyone nearly thought she might even pass out.<br></p><p>\u201cMaisie! On your sister\u2019s big day, really?!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I \u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust because you didn\u2019t get a decent wedding, doesn\u2019t mean you can just let your daughter ruin Y/N\u2019s big day like this!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cENOUGH!\u201d Layla\u2019s scream caused everyone to hold their tongues immediately to look at her. With both hands on her hips, she glared at the mother, then Maisie, and her best friend too. \u201cInstead of shouting and blaming each other, can we focus on how to take care of the not so little problem on Y/N\u2019s ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do anything about it.\u201d Maisie sighed.<br></p><p>\u201cWe can splash white paint on it!\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone looked at the little girl who seemed so proud of her idea. But instead of pinching her forehead like her mother or mumbling curse words like Layla, Y/N only burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane? How can you still laugh at a moment like this?\u201d Layla narrowed her eyes at the girl who was trying her best to hold it in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, really,\u201d Y/N said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure I can still walk down the aisle with red handprints on my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ\u2026\u201d The mother muttered under her breath and hurriedly left the room before she couldn\u2019t keep her patience anymore. Then Maisie followed as well, pulling Eleanor along so the little one couldn\u2019t cause any more problems.\u00a0</p><p>Now left alone with Y/N, Layla could finally raise her voice, \u201cfor once! I just want you to look perfect for once, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Y/N only giggled and hugged her friend tight.\u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI already feel perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you loved this dress\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI love Harry more,\u201d said the bride as she pulled away.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t care about my look. Don\u2019t you worry about me.\u201d<br></p><p>Layla opened her mouth to argue just in time there was a knock on the door and Olivia stepped in, carrying the maid of honor gown. Without thinking twice, Layla marched towards the girl to take the dress for Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cHere, put this on. It\u2019s gonna be a bit uncomfortable around the waist but I think you\u2019ll manage.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026What are you gonna wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my closet, bitch. You honestly think I don\u2019t have a plan B to Z?\u201d\u00a0said Layla as she turned to glare at Olivia.\u00a0\u201cBlondie, come tell Niall to bring me the backless satin dress. Just say that, he\u2019ll know which one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me\u00a0\u2018blondie\u2019?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d The maid-of-honor scoffed, lifting one eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cWould you prefer the other nickname?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0Olivia shook her head fast, a bit surprised because that was the very first time Layla had ever smiled at her. To be honest, it made her quite happy as well; and so she nodded fast and hurried out of the room to go inform the best man about the little situation.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Layla turned back to her best friend and gripped her shoulders, lips pressed together hard.\u00a0With a deep breath, she declared, \u201clet\u2019s make you perfect again.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cNiall, what are you doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHelping!\u201d</p><p>Harry reached up to touch the bowtie, but his best friend quickly slapped his hand away in an instant. Eyebrows furrowed, Niall tugged on the piece of fabric way too hard, making Harry tilt his head down and their foreheads bumped into each other.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, have you never done this before?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Have you ever seen me wear a tie?\u201d Niall scoffed, shaking his head, eyes fixed on the work as he mumbled, \u201cbut I swear to god it looked so easy on that youtube tutorial\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Harry huffed, raising his chin as he shouted loudly so his family waiting outside could hear him. \u201cGemma! Help! Mum! Anyone?\u201d</p><p>It took Gemma less than a second to burst in as if she knew they were gonna need her at one point. She pushed Niall away and took his place, glaring at both of the men.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ! You babies cannot do anything on your own!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me a baby, Gem. I\u2019m the one getting married.\u201d</p><p>The older sister exchanged amusing glances with Niall while shaking her head in response to Harry\u2019s slop-sided grin.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said. \u201cY/N is gonna baby you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! You\u2019re right. I won\u2019t ever have to grow up.\u201d</p><p>He giggled like a little boy when Gemma pulled away and rested both hands on her hips. As she gazed at him from head to toes, Harry opened his arms and spun around, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look, guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as good as me at my senior prom but I guess this will do,\u201d Niall teased, causing Harry to pick up the sock on the floor and toss it at him as both dissolved into laughter. Gemma could only watch them in silence while pinching her own forehead.</p><p>All of a sudden, the door to the changing room flew open and Anne rushed in, without saying a word first, she just walked straight to her son and pulled him into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, my sweet baby looks so good!\u201d She gushed, cupping his face and kissing his cheek like he was five, making Gemma toss her head back and groan.</p><p>\u201cMum, he\u2019s 24 years old!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh darling, he can be fifty and he\u2019s still my little baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re just mad because you\u2019re not the favorite child.\u201d Harry stuck out his tongue, making his sister scoff.</p><p>\u201cAt least, I\u2019m the smart child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s smarter. I get married first, I kind of win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho even made that rule?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhhh, the Styles and Niall all together again, a happy family,\u201d Niall interrupted the siblings as he walked over and grabbed Gemma by the hand, pulling her in to join the other two for a group hug. They rocked back and forth for a couple seconds then Harry began to laugh and tried to wiggle out of those tight arms locked around his torso.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are gonna mess up my look. I need space,\u201d he said, dusting off his clothes, making everyone laugh.</p><p>\u201cMum and I are gonna go check on the girls, okay? Please don\u2019t burn this place down.\u201d</p><p>Niall screwed up his face as he heard Gemma. \u201cHow are we gonna burn th\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou always find a way. That\u2019s what scares me.\u201d The woman rolled her eyes and took her mother\u2019s hand so they could both walk out together. But as soon as she reached the door, her litte brother spoke up fast, calling out her name.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She quickly turned around, raising an eyebrow at a beaming Harry.</p><p>\u201cHow does my baby look?\u201d He asked.</p><p>Laughing, she replied, \u201cso beautiful that you\u2019re gonna start sobbing at the altar.\u201d</p><p>That was all it took for Harry to start grinning from ear to ear. His heart was pounding and he had only imagined his bride in his head. How was he gonna stand on his own two feet when he actually watched her walk down the aisle? Of course she had always been the most beautiful princess to him, but today she was gonna be his queen.\u00a0</p><p>But no matter how overjoyed he was, Harry couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous somehow. His hands were shaking and he couldn\u2019t sit at one spot for over a minute. Now he was pacing back and forth in his dressing room, trying to remember his vow when he heard a knock on the door.</p><p><i>\u201cHaz, it\u2019s Ollie! Can I speak to Niall?\u201d</i><br></p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow, exchanging looks with his best friend who didn\u2019t know why Olivia wanted to speak to him. But Harry told her to come in anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Shyly, the girl entered the room and explained the problem to the groom and his best man. As Harry freaked out because he was afraid Y/N might be sad about the dress, Niall, on the other hand, just fell about. He even joked,\u00a0\u201cI guess we could say little El was caught <i>red handed</i>!\u201d</p><p>Harry immediately smacked him on the arm, causing the blue-eyed man to bounce a step backward, groaning in pain.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you think that one hurts, wait until Layla punches you for not bringing her the dress on time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re right.\u201d Niall quickly grabbed his car key on the table and fled right out of the room. Less than a second later, he poked his head in and told Olivia to stay and assist Harry if he needed anything. Then he was gone in a heartbeat.<br></p><p>Harry and Olivia exchanged awkward smiles behind the closed door as both came to sit down on the couch in the middle of them room, each at one end to stay as far from each other as possible. With her knees together and both hands resting on them, Olivia stole a glance at the man and noticed the tiny notes he was holding.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2026learning your vow?\u201d She asked softly, releasing a slight laugh to lighten up the mood.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. I wrote it myself,\u201d he answered with a proud smile.<br></p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She chuckled.\u00a0\u201cMay I see it?\u201d<br></p><p>Nodding his head, Harry handed the notes to Olivia, who quickly read through them all, eyes squinted to make out a few words he\u2019d sloppily written in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cThis is so beautiful, Haz,\u201d she said at last.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He chuckled slightly, leaning aside as the dimples dug deeper into his cheeks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N\u2019s gonna cry,\u201d she said, handing the notes back to him.\u00a0\u201cI know I would.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Harry knew nothing else to say so he inhaled deeply and released a shaky breath. The silence that followed was obviously awkward yet more comfortable than talking about the thing they should talk about, like everything that had gone wrong between them over the years. However, Olivia felt like if they wanted to save their friendship, she should take the initiative to say something now that she had her chance.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she blurted, making him freeze in confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFor\u2026what I did.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt was a couple years ago.\u201d He chuckled, putting the note down so he could toy with the rings on his fingers to avoid looking into her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about it anymore.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut\u2026I have been treating you like the same boy I used to know, when you\u2019re not that boy anymore,\u201d Olivia replied with a guilty grin.\u00a0\u201cI ruined our friendship, Haz. You used to be my second family, my real one actually\u2026Now I\u2019ve got none and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d He shook his head. With a bit of hesitation, he thought for a few seconds before reaching out to hold her hand which was gripping the hem of her knee-length dress. \u201cI still care about you. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the same way you want me to but\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s enough. As long as you still care about me, I\u2019m happy.\u201d She put her other hand ontop of his, giving it a squeeze as they held their gaze and shared a smile. It took her a moment to continue, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that things happened the way it did and I cannot be your best man like the promise we made years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, when I made that promise I didn\u2019t think I would ever get married,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes as both of them chuckled.\u00a0\u201cBut look at me now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cLook at you now\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Without warning, Ben burst into the room, causing the two friends to rise up at the same time and turned to the breathless man standing with one hand on the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, boys!\u201d He announced with so much excitement, but the grin on his face faded as he looked from side to side. \u201cWait, where\u2019s Niall?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe came home to get Layla\u2019s dress?\u201d Harry said as Olivia fixed his bowtie again for him and both hurried out of the room.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her dress?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLong story. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ben still lifted an eyebrow but he soon brushed his confusion aside and picked up his pace to catch up with the other two.</p><p>\u201cCan I fill in his place?\u201d He elated shouted, making Harry chortle.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was the answer.<br></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry had a dream last night about how his wedding was going to be. He woke up with a bright smile on his face even with the lack of sleep because it was wonderful, truly beautiful. He remembered exactly how he was feeling as he stood at the altar in his dream. The room was full of pink clouds and there was only him standing there and watching his wife walk on the rose petals towards him, a bright smile on her gorgeous face. But even while dreaming, his heart was still beating like a drum and he was shaking with strong emotions.</p><p>Now, while standing at the real altar, hands held together as he took a deep breath when the music started to play, his adrenaline tripled and his heart fought to escape from his chest. Because he knew what was happening was real, not just a fantasy anymore. And just a couple seconds more, his beautiful Y/N would walk in and take his breath away.</p><p>Harry\u2019s impatience made those seconds felt like hours. His sweaty palms got so uncomfortable that he had to wipe them on his pants when all attention was no longer on him. But no matter how long he really had to wait, that moment did arrive.\u00a0</p><p>The big entrance finally opened wide, and Harry nearly held his breath. The small room with around thirty guests sank to silence. Harry mentally thanked God that they\u2019d decided to have a small wedding because he didn\u2019t have to be distracted by anything else to focus on his wife only.\u00a0</p><p>When he locked eyes with her for the first time at their wedding, it almost felt like the whole world disappeared. Now, reality wasn\u2019t so different from the dream he\u2019d had, just him and her and no one else like from the start. He almost forgot the fact that she wasn\u2019t wearing the fancy wedding dress she loved more than anything in the world, and he believed at that point she didn\u2019t really care either. Time seemed to pause and his brain started showing all the flashbacks from their very first met up to that very moment. Harry had been holding back his tears from the second the music started playing, but now his eyes had welled up and it only took him a second to start sniffing into his palm.\u00a0</p><p>The background song faded out as Y/N took his hand, facing him with tears shimmering in her eyes. He could see his mother blowing her nose in the little handkerchief she always carried around in her purse. Even Layla, whom he\u2019d never seen shed a tear was subtly wiping away the ones running down her cheek as she tried to not let it smudge her mascara.</p><p>\u201cDear friends and family,\u201d the priest began when everyone had settled and the room sank to utter silence.\u00a0\u201cWe are gathered here today to witness and celebrate\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry could barely listen to what the man was saying because right now he only paid attention to his bride. With a Cheshire Cat grin, he mouthed to her \"you\u2019re beautiful\u201d, feeling his own heart flutter when she mouthed back \u201cso are you\u201d with an equally wide smile.</p><p>\u201cPsst, Harry\u2026Harry!\u201d Niall slightly tugged on Harry\u2019s sleeve to grab his attention, making the couple break their loving eye contact to look at the priest who had one brow raised at the groom.</p><p>\u201cYour vow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Harry quickly covered his mouth as everyone cracked up at his little accident. Blushing, he gave Anne a little wave. \u201cSorry, mum,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your favorite child now right?\u201d Gemma whispered to her mother, who could only laugh and urged her son to continue.</p><p>Harry held up a finger, asking for a second as he searched in his pockets for the little notes he\u2019d written his vow on. But then he remembered he\u2019d left them all in his dressing room and his eyes nearly popped right out of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Y/N whispered when she saw the look on his face, but her man didn\u2019t have the heart to admit that he was too nervous he couldn\u2019t remember any part of the speech he\u2019d worked so hard on. The anxiety was burning him up just like that time he was waiting for her to come home to finally tell her \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time in person. Taking a deep breath, he reached out to hold one of her hand with both of his and bring it to his chest where his heart was. The voice inside his head told him that to say what he felt, like he was talking to her in private without any witness. The thought had calmed him down quite a bit now.</p><p>Eyes locked with hers, Harry cleared his throat and began,\u00a0\u201cY/N\u2026you know I\u2019m not good with words so if my vow sucks, <i>please</i> don\u2019t cancel the wedding.\u201d Laughter filled the room, giving Harry more confidence to go on as he gripped her hand tighter and received a reassuring smile in response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe officially met the first time in a coffee shop on campus. From the first few words you said to me, I could tell you didn\u2019t like me very much, and I also thought to myself\u00a0\u2018god help me, am I gonna have to live with this person for the rest of my college years?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes as all the guests laughed again.</p><p>\u201c<i>But.</i>\u201d Harry shushed them by raising a finger.\u00a0\u201cI ended up falling madly in love with that girl whom I used to think was the most annoying girl I\u2019d ever met. Now, she\u2019s the most important woman in my life, right next to my mum.\u201d<br></p><p>Gemma suddenly cleared her throat so Harry had to turn and glare right at her.</p><p>\u201c<i>And</i> my sister,\u201d he added, receiving a smirk from Gemma as she waved her hand for him to continue.<br></p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he continued, smiling widely at the girl he loved.\u00a0\u201cI cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.\u201d</p><p>Someone in the back said <i>\u201caww\u201d</i> and Layla immediately shushed the woman so her friend could go on.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d Harry exhaled another smile. \u201cI vow to always be patient in our marriage because you\u2019ve always been\u00a0patient with me. I know it was frustrating to love someone who had no idea\u00a0what love was until he loved you. But somehow you never gave up on that boy, even though his foolishness often caused you headache and sometimes even made you cry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N lifted the bouquet in her other hand to cover half of her face but Harry could see her eyes glistened with tears and that was all it took for him to start crying again. But he still had to finish his vow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know they always said\u00a0\u2018til death do us part\u2019 at weddings, but I don\u2019t want that. If I had a thousand lifetimes, I\u2019d want to fall in love with you again a thousand times, because you\u2019re my soulmate. Baby, I vow to always love you, in this lifetime. And the next. And many after that. All over again. Forever and always.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Harry finished his vow, Layla released a sob so loud that got all eyes turned to her. The maid of honor mumbled an apology and looked away so no one could see her cry. Meanwhile, Ben, who was standing right beside Niall, tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, \u201cif I were you I would start writing my vow today.\u201d The warning caused the best man to anxiously blow up his cheeks and begin to think about what he was gonna say at his own wedding. Layla would never let him live with a vow second to his best friend\u2019s.</p><p>The priest told Y/N that it was her turn to speak her vow, and the girl exhaled sharply before wiping away her tears.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She breathed.\u00a0\u201cI thought it\u2019d be easy to beat you at giving an emotional vow but I guess I\u2019ve underestimated you.\u201d Harry shook his head no as the others chortled at her lovely humor.\u00a0\u201cOkay, here goes\u2026\u201d</p><p>The room turned quiet in an instant so the bride could begin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I know I\u2019ve said I love you so many times before and I bet you already know that. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever mentioned how much I adore you. Harry, you are such an amazing person, a great man who takes care of the ones he loves, who always know what to say and what to do, who\u2019s good at almost everything,\u2026except for when he\u2019s with Niall.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Niall said and Harry shot him a glare, making all the guests roar with laughter.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve always been there for me, always loved me, and reminded me that I can be amazing and beautiful and great as anyone else.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou are, love,\u201d he mumbled to her and all the others sighed and aww\u2019ed at the same time.<br></p><p>\u201cSo I think I must be the luckiest girl on the planet to be standing here with you today.\u201d She sniffed, quickly wiping off the tears at the corners of her eyes before her makeup was ruined. The hand that was holding his had never let go.\u00a0\u201cForever after, I vow to always be by your side through it all, to never give up on us and support you no matter what, just like what you\u2019ve been doing for us since day one. I vow to love you with all my heart and always be patient with you, always be true to you, always be loyal.\u201d Then she laughed softly.\u00a0\u201cI know this may sound silly, but I love to think that we\u2019re made from the same stardust, and when we die we\u2019ll go back to being the same star, because I cannot imagine being with anyone else other than you. I will love you always, from one lifetime to the next. You\u2019re my first love. And I cannot wait to make you my forever. \u201c<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Layla said to the lady at the front row who was sobbing just as hard as she was.<br></p><p>\u201cRings, Niall!\u201d Harry turned to the best man who was too busy clapping his hands just like everyone else to remember his duty. Hurriedly, Niall pulled out the rings from his jacket, sighing in relief that he didn\u2019t drop them and happily handing the couple their rings so they could put them on for each other.<br></p><p>\"And now, by the power vested in me, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife. You may now\u2014\u201d Without waiting for him to finish, Harry grabbed Y/N and kissed her hard on the mouth. All the guests rose from their seats to clap their hands and cheered for the newly weds.\u00a0<br></p><p>\"Family and Friends, I present to you for the first time <i>Mr</i> and <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The wedding reception was meant to be a warm dinner between family and friends, but thanks to Niall\u2019s brilliant MC skills, everyone ended up moving all the tables and chairs to the sides so they could get up and dance. Y/N had long forgotten where she\u2019d left her heels, now was dancing on bare feet with Layla the the girls in the middle of the room, meanwhile Harry was held back by the men as they kept offering him drinks knowing he could never say no. The parents could only sit on the sidelines and carry on with their conversations about the couple\u2019s future as if they were the ones to decide how it was gonna be.</p><p>In a room full of bliss, Olivia had never felt more alone. So instead of standing in the corner the entire time, she quietly snuck out to the main hall for some fresh air while waiting for the celebration to be over. But as soon as she walked through the door, the girl stopped dead in her tracks when seeing the couple in the main lobby.</p><p>In the heat of the fight, Jack and his date didn\u2019t pay attention to her. Olivia knew it wasn\u2019t right to watch, still she was too curious to walk away. Of course she didn\u2019t know who the woman was and why she was shouting at Jack. But the guy seemed miserable over there, almost making her step forward to interfere. However, she didn\u2019t have to be his hero. Olivia heard Jack say something like a goodbye and an apology. And the woman, now with tears in her eyes, stormed straight to the main exit, leaving him behind with a massive frown upon his face.\u00a0</p><p>Olivia was now torn between walking over there to ask if he was alright, and walking away before he spotted her and thought she was being nosy (which wasn\u2019t exactly false). So she stood still, fidgeting for a few seconds when all of a sudden he turned his head, looking at her straight in the eyes. The girl freaked out and attempted to run, but she bumped into a table by accident and got the hem of her skirt stuck in it.</p><p>Jack tried not to laugh as he marched towards the damsel in distress and bent down to get her skirt out of the edge of the table, trying to be careful so he wouldn\u2019t damage the fabric.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she cursed, but soon noticed his reaction and mumbled a quick apology, making him chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cYou love ruining your own dresses, huh?\u201d He teased, leaving a huge grin on the girl\u2019s face.<br></p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026I didn\u2019t see you at the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026I skipped it on purpose.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause of your girlfriend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Her questioned made Jack raise an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know if she was really your girlfriend. I only guessed.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe <i>was</i>.\u201d He sighed, lifting his shoulders.\u00a0\u201cNot anymore. I think you just witnessed our break up.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Livy.\u201d<br></p><p>Olivia\u2019s face brightened up at the nickname.\u00a0\u201cOh you remember my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name is not really hard to remember.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Jack\u2019s comment was followed up by a fit of laughter which instantly died down as soon as they made eye contact and turned away from each other.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out here?\u201d He asked the girl as the silence had become quite awkward.<br></p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t have many friends here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wedding, Livy, not high school.\u201d Jack chuckled and rolled his eyes.\u00a0\u201cCome in, I\u2019ll be your friend for the night. Then we\u2019ll dance our sorrow away.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t know if this man was joking about being sad or he was just very good at hiding his feelings, but maybe a made-believe happiness would work for her right now.</p><p>\u201cJust a warning, I\u2019m a terrible dancer,\u201d she told him, laughing slightly.<br></p><p>With a smile, he said,\u00a0\u201cgreat, so am I.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Y/N waved enthusiastically when she saw her boss, who put on a smile and opened his arms so she could go in for a hug.\u00a0</p><p>That was actually the first proper embrace they\u2019d ever shared, and there was something heart-warming about it, probably because it was different from the time she hugged him as he\u2019d just lost his mother, or the time he held her in the lift as she had a panic attack. It was just a simple hug, which was why it was so special.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you at the ceremony?!\u201d Her face puckered up as she pulled away, holding his hands.\u00a0\u201cYou missed the best part!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, I was busy.\u201d He smiled, yet she didn\u2019t seem too pleased with his answer.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always busy.\u201d<br></p><p>The eye-roll she gave him only expanded his grin.\u00a0</p><p>The other day in the lift when they were alone, he almost got weak and told her he loved her. But now, seeing her this happy and full of life, he was glad he hadn\u2019t got a chance to say it. Some things were best kept to yourself.</p><p>Jack changed his mind about attending the wedding ceremony at the last minute because he couldn\u2019t imagine how he was going to witness the girl he loved say \u201cI do\u201d and become someone else\u2019s forever. That was why he got into a fight with Maria on the way to the wedding reception. Maria had asked him to tell her the truth, and he did, so she got mad and left. Despite so, he couldn\u2019t think of a better way they could\u2019ve ended the relationship which had been a fail from the start.\u00a0</p><p>Even though he\u2019d never actually thought about coming between Y/N and Harry, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he loved her. He was happy for her, yet he would\u2019ve been so broken had he actually listened to her vow. However, the sad truth about life was how you never got to choose whom you were gonna fall in love with, so if love came, you had to accept love, even if it didn\u2019t come to stay.\u00a0</p><p>Jack now had to accept the fact that he\u2019d fallen in love with someone who was untouchable, and his relationship with Maria had been a mistake. She was just looking for someone to possess, not to love; and he was just looking for someone to help him forget about Y/N. As it turned out, the only way for him to move on was to do let his heart heal on its own and not try to fill the void with something else other than love.</p><p>\u201cWait, where\u2019s the other dress?\u201d Jack asked after pulling away and by the way Y/N kept on giggling, he assumed she was a bit tipsy.<br></p><p>\u201cMy niece left two red handprints on my ass.\u201d She laughed, raising her hands to demonstrate the action, cracking him up.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you still look good in this one.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She gave him a smile and twirled around so he could see the motion of the dress.\u00a0\u201cBut honestly I cannot eat because if I do, the zipper might burst. My best friend is super-model skinny.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t say anything but the smile on his face never faded as he watched her beam grow. Everyone in the room clapped their hands when the upbeat song ended, then all gathered to the middle of the room as Niall announced a slow song for the couples was next.</p><p>Y/N looked behind her boss with a confused look as she asked,\u00a0\u201cwhere\u2019s Maria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d he lied, curving his lips into a smile before pointing at Olivia standing by the wall.\u00a0\u201cBut I got myself a new dance partner, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Y/N giggled, giving the blonde across the room a little wave as she turned back to Jack.\u00a0\u201cAlso, I\u2019m very happy that you showed up.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d He nodded, holding both of her shoulders firmly.\u00a0\u201cCongrats, Mrs. Styles.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied, giving him one last smile as she watched him return to Olivia. Maybe love didn\u2019t have to be a romantic bond between two people. Sometimes, it took form as a bond between two friends, who wanted nothing more than happiness for the other.<br></p><p><i><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br>You can feel it on the way home, way home</i></i><br></p><p><i>\u201cWifey!\u201d</i><br></p><p>Y/N turned around just in time Harry crashed into her arms, squeezing all the air out of his wife with that bear hug. She could guess how much he\u2019d drunk because he couldn\u2019t stop giggling like a little boy, and his happiness was so contagious that she couldn\u2019t help but laugh along. She pulled away a bit to hold his face with both hands. His arms tightened around her waist, keeping her pressed against him so he could whisper into her ear,\u00a0\u201cdance with me.\u201d</p><p><i><i>You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br>You are in love, true love</i></i><br></p><p>\u201cYou finally escaped from the boys, I see.\u201d Her arms came wrapped around his neck to start guiding them to the beat of the song.<br></p><p>\u201cThey literally tried to drown me in vodka even after I\u2019d told them I needed to stay sober for you,\u201d he said in annoyance, making her giggle. \u201cIf I disappoint you tonight, it\u2019s because I wasted most of my energy on fighting them.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Morning, his place<br>Burnt toast, Sunday<br>You keep his shirt<br>He keeps his word</i><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never disappointed me though.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAww that\u2019s the first lie you\u2019ve told me as my wife.\u201d<br></p><p>She smacked him on the arm as both broke into a fit of laughter.</p><p><i>And for once you let go<br>Of your fears and your ghosts<br>One step, not much<br>But it said enough</i><br></p><p>Harry looked around the room and spotted in the far corner Y/N\u2019s two\u00a0friends from high school John and Violet slow dancing together. John held his pregnant wife like she was the most delicate thing in the world and the sight made Harry\u2019s heart flutter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to put a baby inside of you,\u201d he blurted, causing Y/N to guffaw.<br></p><p>\u201cOh my god, are you gonna replace the word \u2018sex\u2019 with \u2018putting a baby inside of you\u2019 from now on?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He bit back a smile and pinched her side playfully.\u00a0\u201cI mean, I want to have a baby with you. A little us.\u201d<br></p><p><i>You kiss on sidewalks<br>You fight and you talk<br></i><i><i>One night he wakes<br></i></i><i><i>Strange look on his face</i></i><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been desperate for a baby since you found Treasure though.\u201d She rolled her eyes and joked,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you married me just to get a human baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen wanting to marry you since your brother\u2019s wedding actually.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Pauses, then says<br>\"You\u2019re my best friend\u201d<br>And you knew what it was<br>He is in love</i><br></p><p>His confession caused her to pull away a bit so they could lock eyes with one another. She stroked his cheeks tenderly and traced her fingertips across his pink lips. Smiling, she said,\u00a0\u201cnow that you mention, our first dance was at my brother\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and now we\u2019re dancing at our own. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p><i>So it goes<br>You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round<br>And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown<br>And you understand now why they lost their minds<br>And fought the wars<br>And why I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words</i><br></p><p>\u201cDid you like my vow?\u201d He asked with a smug look on his face because he already knew the answer, but wanting to hear it from her still.<br></p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it already obvious?\u201d She snorted. \u201cI weeped like a baby in front of you and everyone.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe only time I was happy that I made you cry.\u201d Harry sighed, stroking her sides gently. \u201cHey, baby, I just came up with something I should\u2019ve added to my vow.\u201d</p><p>Despite already knowing he was going to say something silly, she still nodded and told him to go on. Then with a funny high-pitched voice, he drunkenly sang,<i>\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re so sexy, you\u2019re so fine. I\u2019m gonna make you mah wife.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N tossed her head back as she laughed and cupped his face between her palms.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t put that in your vow. I would\u2019ve returned the ring and walked out immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re regretting this whole thing aren\u2019t you?\u201d He kissed her cheek, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Y/N flashed a smile and nodded her head quickly to play along with the joke.<br></p><p>\u201cInstead of going back home after this, let\u2019s go get divorced,\u201d she playfully suggested. The pretentious hurt look on his face got her dying on laughter.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, but hold on, let me hold my wife a bit longer before she leaves me,\u201d said Harry as he kissed her forehead and pulled her in again, mouth at her ear when he whispered,\u00a0\u201clove you to the moon and back.\u201d</p><p>With butterflies going wild in her stomach, she also told him,\u00a0\u201cI love you too, forever and always, darling.\u201d</p><p><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br>You can feel it on the way home, way home<br>You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br>You are in love, true love<br>You are in love<br></i></p></p>",

I can&rsquo;t believe&nbsp;I&rsquo;m getting married.&rdquo;</p><p>Letting out a soft laugh, Layla came to stand right behind her best friend in front of the full-length mirror. Now with her wedding dress on, Y/N looked like the prettiest princess from a story book, and the thought made Layla smile as they locked eyes in the mirror. Even if Y/N hadn&rsquo;t repeatedly mentioned how nervous she was, her ragged breathing would already have given herself away.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said you&rsquo;d been ready for this day your whole life?&rdquo; Layla chuckled, crossing her arms as she watched a beam grow on the bride&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; Y/N sucked in a breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was&nbsp;easier to imagine.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Layla nodded slightly and stepped forward to wrap her arms around the maid-of-honor&rsquo;s waist, chin resting on her shoulder as they exchanged nonchalant smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy for you,&rdquo; said the green-eyed girl.&nbsp;&ldquo;Knowing that I&rsquo;ve been here with you guys from the start of it all makes me so emotional.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Her statement caused Y/N to chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you kind of hated me at the beginning.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo; Layla laughed, rolling her eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your hideous outfits got on my nerves, no offence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt Y/N!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The high-pitched voice got both girls to turn to the entrance when the little girl burst into the room and rushed towards the bride, hugging her tightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo; Y/N bent down to hold the child by the arms.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, my love. Look at you in your tiny dress! Oh my god, you look like a little princess!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, aunt Y/N. You look like a princess too!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;El, do not disturb your aunt!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N looked up to find her sister standing at the door. As Maisie marched forward to grab the little girl, Y/N pulled Eleanor close to her chest .&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Maisie. I&rsquo;m almost done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you should already be done right now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still pretty earl&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Layla!&rdquo; Y/N stood up fast and turned to her best friend.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that in front of El!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But your skirt!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Layla quickly grabbed Y/N by the shoulders and dragged her to the mirror so she could see the big problem for herself. Two red handprints stood out on the white fabric and could be seen from miles away let alone up close. Y/N tugged on the skirt of her dress in shock, for a second completely speechless and freaked out by the reflection in the mirror.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo; Maisie shouted, forcing her daughter to show both of her hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh god, were you just messing with those paint buckets in the lobby?!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, no, sis, it&rsquo;s fine! Don&rsquo;t yell at her!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine?!&rdquo; Layla cried out.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got red handprints on your ass! How the fuck is <i>this</i> fine?!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who got what on her ass now?!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jesus&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N cursed under her breath when her mother burst into the room and slammed the door shut, and her facial expression was completely expected. Margaret&rsquo;s eyes grew wide the moment she spotted the handprints on the back of Y/N&rsquo;s dress in the mirror. From that look on the woman&rsquo;s face, everyone nearly thought she might even pass out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maisie! On your sister&rsquo;s big day, really?!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I &mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just because you didn&rsquo;t get a decent wedding, doesn&rsquo;t mean you can just let your daughter ruin Y/N&rsquo;s big day like this!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean to!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;ENOUGH!&rdquo; Layla&rsquo;s scream caused everyone to hold their tongues immediately to look at her. With both hands on her hips, she glared at the mother, then Maisie, and her best friend too. &ldquo;Instead of shouting and blaming each other, can we focus on how to take care of the not so little problem on Y/N&rsquo;s ass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can do anything about it.&rdquo; Maisie sighed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We can splash white paint on it!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everyone looked at the little girl who seemed so proud of her idea. But instead of pinching her forehead like her mother or mumbling curse words like Layla, Y/N only burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you insane? How can you still laugh at a moment like this?&rdquo; Layla narrowed her eyes at the girl who was trying her best to hold it in.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal, really,&rdquo; Y/N said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can still walk down the aisle with red handprints on my ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ&hellip;&rdquo; The mother muttered under her breath and hurriedly left the room before she couldn&rsquo;t keep her patience anymore. Then Maisie followed as well, pulling Eleanor along so the little one couldn&rsquo;t cause any more problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Now left alone with Y/N, Layla could finally raise her voice, &ldquo;for once! I just want you to look perfect for once, Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N only giggled and hugged her friend tight.&nbsp;&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;I already feel perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you loved this dress&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love Harry more,&rdquo; said the bride as she pulled away.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about my look. Don&rsquo;t you worry about me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Layla opened her mouth to argue just in time there was a knock on the door and Olivia stepped in, carrying the maid of honor gown. Without thinking twice, Layla marched towards the girl to take the dress for Y/N.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Here, put this on. It&rsquo;s gonna be a bit uncomfortable around the waist but I think you&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;What are you gonna wear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen my closet, bitch. You honestly think I don&rsquo;t have a plan B to Z?&rdquo;&nbsp;said Layla as she turned to glare at Olivia.&nbsp;&ldquo;Blondie, come tell Niall to bring me the backless satin dress. Just say that, he&rsquo;ll know which one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You called me&nbsp;&lsquo;blondie&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; The maid-of-honor scoffed, lifting one eyebrow.&nbsp;&ldquo;Would you prefer the other nickname?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;Olivia shook her head fast, a bit surprised because that was the very first time Layla had ever smiled at her. To be honest, it made her quite happy as well; and so she nodded fast and hurried out of the room to go inform the best man about the little situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Layla turned back to her best friend and gripped her shoulders, lips pressed together hard.&nbsp;With a deep breath, she declared, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make you perfect again.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Niall, what are you doing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Helping!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry reached up to touch the bowtie, but his best friend quickly slapped his hand away in an instant. Eyebrows furrowed, Niall tugged on the piece of fabric way too hard, making Harry tilt his head down and their foreheads bumped into each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, have you never done this before?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Have you ever seen me wear a tie?&rdquo; Niall scoffed, shaking his head, eyes fixed on the work as he mumbled, &ldquo;but I swear to god it looked so easy on that youtube tutorial&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Harry huffed, raising his chin as he shouted loudly so his family waiting outside could hear him. &ldquo;Gemma! Help! Mum! Anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>It took Gemma less than a second to burst in as if she knew they were gonna need her at one point. She pushed Niall away and took his place, glaring at both of the men.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ! You babies cannot do anything on your own!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me a baby, Gem. I&rsquo;m the one getting married.&rdquo;</p><p>The older sister exchanged amusing glances with Niall while shaking her head in response to Harry&rsquo;s slop-sided grin.</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Y/N is gonna baby you anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! You&rsquo;re right. I won&rsquo;t ever have to grow up.&rdquo;</p><p>He giggled like a little boy when Gemma pulled away and rested both hands on her hips. As she gazed at him from head to toes, Harry opened his arms and spun around, smiling widely.</p><p>&ldquo;How do I look, guys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not as good as me at my senior prom but I guess this will do,&rdquo; Niall teased, causing Harry to pick up the sock on the floor and toss it at him as both dissolved into laughter. Gemma could only watch them in silence while pinching her own forehead.</p><p>All of a sudden, the door to the changing room flew open and Anne rushed in, without saying a word first, she just walked straight to her son and pulled him into a tight hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my sweet baby looks so good!&rdquo; She gushed, cupping his face and kissing his cheek like he was five, making Gemma toss her head back and groan.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, he&rsquo;s 24 years old!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh darling, he can be fifty and he&rsquo;s still my little baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re just mad because you&rsquo;re not the favorite child.&rdquo; Harry stuck out his tongue, making his sister scoff.</p><p>&ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;m the smart child?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter who&rsquo;s smarter. I get married first, I kind of win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who even made that rule?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ahhhh, the Styles and Niall all together again, a happy family,&rdquo; Niall interrupted the siblings as he walked over and grabbed Gemma by the hand, pulling her in to join the other two for a group hug. They rocked back and forth for a couple seconds then Harry began to laugh and tried to wiggle out of those tight arms locked around his torso.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys are gonna mess up my look. I need space,&rdquo; he said, dusting off his clothes, making everyone laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum and I are gonna go check on the girls, okay? Please don&rsquo;t burn this place down.&rdquo;</p><p>Niall screwed up his face as he heard Gemma. &ldquo;How are we gonna burn th&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You always find a way. That&rsquo;s what scares me.&rdquo; The woman rolled her eyes and took her mother&rsquo;s hand so they could both walk out together. But as soon as she reached the door, her litte brother spoke up fast, calling out her name.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She quickly turned around, raising an eyebrow at a beaming Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;How does my baby look?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>Laughing, she replied, &ldquo;so beautiful that you&rsquo;re gonna start sobbing at the altar.&rdquo;</p><p>That was all it took for Harry to start grinning from ear to ear. His heart was pounding and he had only imagined his bride in his head. How was he gonna stand on his own two feet when he actually watched her walk down the aisle? Of course she had always been the most beautiful princess to him, but today she was gonna be his queen.&nbsp;</p><p>But no matter how overjoyed he was, Harry couldn&rsquo;t help but feel nervous somehow. His hands were shaking and he couldn&rsquo;t sit at one spot for over a minute. Now he was pacing back and forth in his dressing room, trying to remember his vow when he heard a knock on the door.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Haz, it&rsquo;s Ollie! Can I speak to Niall?&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow, exchanging looks with his best friend who didn&rsquo;t know why Olivia wanted to speak to him. But Harry told her to come in anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Shyly, the girl entered the room and explained the problem to the groom and his best man. As Harry freaked out because he was afraid Y/N might be sad about the dress, Niall, on the other hand, just fell about. He even joked,&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess we could say little El was caught <i>red handed</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry immediately smacked him on the arm, causing the blue-eyed man to bounce a step backward, groaning in pain.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you think that one hurts, wait until Layla punches you for not bringing her the dress on time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Niall quickly grabbed his car key on the table and fled right out of the room. Less than a second later, he poked his head in and told Olivia to stay and assist Harry if he needed anything. Then he was gone in a heartbeat.<br /></p><p>Harry and Olivia exchanged awkward smiles behind the closed door as both came to sit down on the couch in the middle of them room, each at one end to stay as far from each other as possible. With her knees together and both hands resting on them, Olivia stole a glance at the man and noticed the tiny notes he was holding.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you&hellip;learning your vow?&rdquo; She asked softly, releasing a slight laugh to lighten up the mood.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I wrote it myself,&rdquo; he answered with a proud smile.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; She chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;May I see it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Nodding his head, Harry handed the notes to Olivia, who quickly read through them all, eyes squinted to make out a few words he&rsquo;d sloppily written in a hurry.</p><p>&ldquo;This is so beautiful, Haz,&rdquo; she said at last.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He chuckled slightly, leaning aside as the dimples dug deeper into his cheeks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rsquo;s gonna cry,&rdquo; she said, handing the notes back to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know I would.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Harry knew nothing else to say so he inhaled deeply and released a shaky breath. The silence that followed was obviously awkward yet more comfortable than talking about the thing they should talk about, like everything that had gone wrong between them over the years. However, Olivia felt like if they wanted to save their friendship, she should take the initiative to say something now that she had her chance.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she blurted, making him freeze in confusion.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For&hellip;what I did.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was a couple years ago.&rdquo; He chuckled, putting the note down so he could toy with the rings on his fingers to avoid looking into her eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even think about it anymore.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip;I have been treating you like the same boy I used to know, when you&rsquo;re not that boy anymore,&rdquo; Olivia replied with a guilty grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;I ruined our friendship, Haz. You used to be my second family, my real one actually&hellip;Now I&rsquo;ve got none and it&rsquo;s all my fault.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; He shook his head. With a bit of hesitation, he thought for a few seconds before reaching out to hold her hand which was gripping the hem of her knee-length dress. &ldquo;I still care about you. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the same way you want me to but&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s&hellip;it&rsquo;s enough. As long as you still care about me, I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo; She put her other hand ontop of his, giving it a squeeze as they held their gaze and shared a smile. It took her a moment to continue, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that things happened the way it did and I cannot be your best man like the promise we made years ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be fair, when I made that promise I didn&rsquo;t think I would ever get married,&rdquo; he said, rolling his eyes as both of them chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;But look at me now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; She sighed happily. &ldquo;Look at you now&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Without warning, Ben burst into the room, causing the two friends to rise up at the same time and turned to the breathless man standing with one hand on the doorknob.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, boys!&rdquo; He announced with so much excitement, but the grin on his face faded as he looked from side to side. &ldquo;Wait, where&rsquo;s Niall?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He came home to get Layla&rsquo;s dress?&rdquo; Harry said as Olivia fixed his bowtie again for him and both hurried out of the room.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened to her dress?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Long story. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>Ben still lifted an eyebrow but he soon brushed his confusion aside and picked up his pace to catch up with the other two.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I fill in his place?&rdquo; He elated shouted, making Harry chortle.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer.<br /></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Harry had a dream last night about how his wedding was going to be. He woke up with a bright smile on his face even with the lack of sleep because it was wonderful, truly beautiful. He remembered exactly how he was feeling as he stood at the altar in his dream. The room was full of pink clouds and there was only him standing there and watching his wife walk on the rose petals towards him, a bright smile on her gorgeous face. But even while dreaming, his heart was still beating like a drum and he was shaking with strong emotions.</p><p>Now, while standing at the real altar, hands held together as he took a deep breath when the music started to play, his adrenaline tripled and his heart fought to escape from his chest. Because he knew what was happening was real, not just a fantasy anymore. And just a couple seconds more, his beautiful Y/N would walk in and take his breath away.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s impatience made those seconds felt like hours. His sweaty palms got so uncomfortable that he had to wipe them on his pants when all attention was no longer on him. But no matter how long he really had to wait, that moment did arrive.&nbsp;</p><p>The big entrance finally opened wide, and Harry nearly held his breath. The small room with around thirty guests sank to silence. Harry mentally thanked God that they&rsquo;d decided to have a small wedding because he didn&rsquo;t have to be distracted by anything else to focus on his wife only.&nbsp;</p><p>When he locked eyes with her for the first time at their wedding, it almost felt like the whole world disappeared. Now, reality wasn&rsquo;t so different from the dream he&rsquo;d had, just him and her and no one else like from the start. He almost forgot the fact that she wasn&rsquo;t wearing the fancy wedding dress she loved more than anything in the world, and he believed at that point she didn&rsquo;t really care either. Time seemed to pause and his brain started showing all the flashbacks from their very first met up to that very moment. Harry had been holding back his tears from the second the music started playing, but now his eyes had welled up and it only took him a second to start sniffing into his palm.&nbsp;</p><p>The background song faded out as Y/N took his hand, facing him with tears shimmering in her eyes. He could see his mother blowing her nose in the little handkerchief she always carried around in her purse. Even Layla, whom he&rsquo;d never seen shed a tear was subtly wiping away the ones running down her cheek as she tried to not let it smudge her mascara.</p><p>&ldquo;Dear friends and family,&rdquo; the priest began when everyone had settled and the room sank to utter silence.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are gathered here today to witness and celebrate&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry could barely listen to what the man was saying because right now he only paid attention to his bride. With a Cheshire Cat grin, he mouthed to her \"you&rsquo;re beautiful&rdquo;, feeling his own heart flutter when she mouthed back &ldquo;so are you&rdquo; with an equally wide smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Psst, Harry&hellip;Harry!&rdquo; Niall slightly tugged on Harry&rsquo;s sleeve to grab his attention, making the couple break their loving eye contact to look at the priest who had one brow raised at the groom.</p><p>&ldquo;Your vow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shit.&rdquo; Harry quickly covered his mouth as everyone cracked up at his little accident. Blushing, he gave Anne a little wave. &ldquo;Sorry, mum,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your favorite child now right?&rdquo; Gemma whispered to her mother, who could only laugh and urged her son to continue.</p><p>Harry held up a finger, asking for a second as he searched in his pockets for the little notes he&rsquo;d written his vow on. But then he remembered he&rsquo;d left them all in his dressing room and his eyes nearly popped right out of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Y/N whispered when she saw the look on his face, but her man didn&rsquo;t have the heart to admit that he was too nervous he couldn&rsquo;t remember any part of the speech he&rsquo;d worked so hard on. The anxiety was burning him up just like that time he was waiting for her to come home to finally tell her &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; for the first time in person. Taking a deep breath, he reached out to hold one of her hand with both of his and bring it to his chest where his heart was. The voice inside his head told him that to say what he felt, like he was talking to her in private without any witness. The thought had calmed him down quite a bit now.</p><p>Eyes locked with hers, Harry cleared his throat and began,&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;you know I&rsquo;m not good with words so if my vow sucks, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t cancel the wedding.&rdquo; Laughter filled the room, giving Harry more confidence to go on as he gripped her hand tighter and received a reassuring smile in response.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We officially met the first time in a coffee shop on campus. From the first few words you said to me, I could tell you didn&rsquo;t like me very much, and I also thought to myself&nbsp;&lsquo;god help me, am I gonna have to live with this person for the rest of my college years?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes as all the guests laughed again.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>But.</i>&rdquo; Harry shushed them by raising a finger.&nbsp;&ldquo;I ended up falling madly in love with that girl whom I used to think was the most annoying girl I&rsquo;d ever met. Now, she&rsquo;s the most important woman in my life, right next to my mum.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Gemma suddenly cleared her throat so Harry had to turn and glare right at her.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>And</i> my sister,&rdquo; he added, receiving a smirk from Gemma as she waved her hand for him to continue.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, smiling widely at the girl he loved.&nbsp;&ldquo;I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.&rdquo;</p><p>Someone in the back said <i>&ldquo;aww&rdquo;</i> and Layla immediately shushed the woman so her friend could go on.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; Harry exhaled another smile. &ldquo;I vow to always be patient in our marriage because you&rsquo;ve always been&nbsp;patient with me. I know it was frustrating to love someone who had no idea&nbsp;what love was until he loved you. But somehow you never gave up on that boy, even though his foolishness often caused you headache and sometimes even made you cry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N lifted the bouquet in her other hand to cover half of her face but Harry could see her eyes glistened with tears and that was all it took for him to start crying again. But he still had to finish his vow.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know they always said&nbsp;&lsquo;til death do us part&rsquo; at weddings, but I don&rsquo;t want that. If I had a thousand lifetimes, I&rsquo;d want to fall in love with you again a thousand times, because you&rsquo;re my soulmate. Baby, I vow to always love you, in this lifetime. And the next. And many after that. All over again. Forever and always.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as Harry finished his vow, Layla released a sob so loud that got all eyes turned to her. The maid of honor mumbled an apology and looked away so no one could see her cry. Meanwhile, Ben, who was standing right beside Niall, tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, &ldquo;if I were you I would start writing my vow today.&rdquo; The warning caused the best man to anxiously blow up his cheeks and begin to think about what he was gonna say at his own wedding. Layla would never let him live with a vow second to his best friend&rsquo;s.</p><p>The priest told Y/N that it was her turn to speak her vow, and the girl exhaled sharply before wiping away her tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; She breathed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d be easy to beat you at giving an emotional vow but I guess I&rsquo;ve underestimated you.&rdquo; Harry shook his head no as the others chortled at her lovely humor.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, here goes&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The room turned quiet in an instant so the bride could begin.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I know I&rsquo;ve said I love you so many times before and I bet you already know that. But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever mentioned how much I adore you. Harry, you are such an amazing person, a great man who takes care of the ones he loves, who always know what to say and what to do, who&rsquo;s good at almost everything,&hellip;except for when he&rsquo;s with Niall.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Niall said and Harry shot him a glare, making all the guests roar with laughter.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve always been there for me, always loved me, and reminded me that I can be amazing and beautiful and great as anyone else.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You are, love,&rdquo; he mumbled to her and all the others sighed and aww&rsquo;ed at the same time.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So I think I must be the luckiest girl on the planet to be standing here with you today.&rdquo; She sniffed, quickly wiping off the tears at the corners of her eyes before her makeup was ruined. The hand that was holding his had never let go.&nbsp;&ldquo;Forever after, I vow to always be by your side through it all, to never give up on us and support you no matter what, just like what you&rsquo;ve been doing for us since day one. I vow to love you with all my heart and always be patient with you, always be true to you, always be loyal.&rdquo; Then she laughed softly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know this may sound silly, but I love to think that we&rsquo;re made from the same stardust, and when we die we&rsquo;ll go back to being the same star, because I cannot imagine being with anyone else other than you. I will love you always, from one lifetime to the next. You&rsquo;re my first love. And I cannot wait to make you my forever. &ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my best friend,&rdquo; Layla said to the lady at the front row who was sobbing just as hard as she was.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Rings, Niall!&rdquo; Harry turned to the best man who was too busy clapping his hands just like everyone else to remember his duty. Hurriedly, Niall pulled out the rings from his jacket, sighing in relief that he didn&rsquo;t drop them and happily handing the couple their rings so they could put them on for each other.<br /></p><p>\"And now, by the power vested in me, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife. You may now&mdash;&rdquo; Without waiting for him to finish, Harry grabbed Y/N and kissed her hard on the mouth. All the guests rose from their seats to clap their hands and cheered for the newly weds.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>\"Family and Friends, I present to you for the first time <i>Mr</i> and <i>Mrs. Styles</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The wedding reception was meant to be a warm dinner between family and friends, but thanks to Niall&rsquo;s brilliant MC skills, everyone ended up moving all the tables and chairs to the sides so they could get up and dance. Y/N had long forgotten where she&rsquo;d left her heels, now was dancing on bare feet with Layla the the girls in the middle of the room, meanwhile Harry was held back by the men as they kept offering him drinks knowing he could never say no. The parents could only sit on the sidelines and carry on with their conversations about the couple&rsquo;s future as if they were the ones to decide how it was gonna be.</p><p>In a room full of bliss, Olivia had never felt more alone. So instead of standing in the corner the entire time, she quietly snuck out to the main hall for some fresh air while waiting for the celebration to be over. But as soon as she walked through the door, the girl stopped dead in her tracks when seeing the couple in the main lobby.</p><p>In the heat of the fight, Jack and his date didn&rsquo;t pay attention to her. Olivia knew it wasn&rsquo;t right to watch, still she was too curious to walk away. Of course she didn&rsquo;t know who the woman was and why she was shouting at Jack. But the guy seemed miserable over there, almost making her step forward to interfere. However, she didn&rsquo;t have to be his hero. Olivia heard Jack say something like a goodbye and an apology. And the woman, now with tears in her eyes, stormed straight to the main exit, leaving him behind with a massive frown upon his face.&nbsp;</p><p>Olivia was now torn between walking over there to ask if he was alright, and walking away before he spotted her and thought she was being nosy (which wasn&rsquo;t exactly false). So she stood still, fidgeting for a few seconds when all of a sudden he turned his head, looking at her straight in the eyes. The girl freaked out and attempted to run, but she bumped into a table by accident and got the hem of her skirt stuck in it.</p><p>Jack tried not to laugh as he marched towards the damsel in distress and bent down to get her skirt out of the edge of the table, trying to be careful so he wouldn&rsquo;t damage the fabric.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; she cursed, but soon noticed his reaction and mumbled a quick apology, making him chuckle.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You love ruining your own dresses, huh?&rdquo; He teased, leaving a huge grin on the girl&rsquo;s face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t see you at the ceremony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;I skipped it on purpose.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because of your girlfriend?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Her questioned made Jack raise an eyebrow.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know if she was really your girlfriend. I only guessed.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She <i>was</i>.&rdquo; He sighed, lifting his shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not anymore. I think you just witnessed our break up.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Livy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Olivia&rsquo;s face brightened up at the nickname.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh you remember my name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your name is not really hard to remember.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Jack&rsquo;s comment was followed up by a fit of laughter which instantly died down as soon as they made eye contact and turned away from each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you out here?&rdquo; He asked the girl as the silence had become quite awkward.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Believe it or not,&rdquo; she said with a sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have many friends here.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wedding, Livy, not high school.&rdquo; Jack chuckled and rolled his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come in, I&rsquo;ll be your friend for the night. Then we&rsquo;ll dance our sorrow away.&rdquo;</p><p>Olivia didn&rsquo;t know if this man was joking about being sad or he was just very good at hiding his feelings, but maybe a made-believe happiness would work for her right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a warning, I&rsquo;m a terrible dancer,&rdquo; she told him, laughing slightly.<br /></p><p>With a smile, he said,&nbsp;&ldquo;great, so am I.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N waved enthusiastically when she saw her boss, who put on a smile and opened his arms so she could go in for a hug.&nbsp;</p><p>That was actually the first proper embrace they&rsquo;d ever shared, and there was something heart-warming about it, probably because it was different from the time she hugged him as he&rsquo;d just lost his mother, or the time he held her in the lift as she had a panic attack. It was just a simple hug, which was why it was so special.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you at the ceremony?!&rdquo; Her face puckered up as she pulled away, holding his hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;You missed the best part!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I was busy.&rdquo; He smiled, yet she didn&rsquo;t seem too pleased with his answer.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always busy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The eye-roll she gave him only expanded his grin.&nbsp;</p><p>The other day in the lift when they were alone, he almost got weak and told her he loved her. But now, seeing her this happy and full of life, he was glad he hadn&rsquo;t got a chance to say it. Some things were best kept to yourself.</p><p>Jack changed his mind about attending the wedding ceremony at the last minute because he couldn&rsquo;t imagine how he was going to witness the girl he loved say &ldquo;I do&rdquo; and become someone else&rsquo;s forever. That was why he got into a fight with Maria on the way to the wedding reception. Maria had asked him to tell her the truth, and he did, so she got mad and left. Despite so, he couldn&rsquo;t think of a better way they could&rsquo;ve ended the relationship which had been a fail from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though he&rsquo;d never actually thought about coming between Y/N and Harry, it didn&rsquo;t change the fact that he loved her. He was happy for her, yet he would&rsquo;ve been so broken had he actually listened to her vow. However, the sad truth about life was how you never got to choose whom you were gonna fall in love with, so if love came, you had to accept love, even if it didn&rsquo;t come to stay.&nbsp;</p><p>Jack now had to accept the fact that he&rsquo;d fallen in love with someone who was untouchable, and his relationship with Maria had been a mistake. She was just looking for someone to possess, not to love; and he was just looking for someone to help him forget about Y/N. As it turned out, the only way for him to move on was to do let his heart heal on its own and not try to fill the void with something else other than love.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, where&rsquo;s the other dress?&rdquo; Jack asked after pulling away and by the way Y/N kept on giggling, he assumed she was a bit tipsy.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My niece left two red handprints on my ass.&rdquo; She laughed, raising her hands to demonstrate the action, cracking him up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you still look good in this one.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; She gave him a smile and twirled around so he could see the motion of the dress.&nbsp;&ldquo;But honestly I cannot eat because if I do, the zipper might burst. My best friend is super-model skinny.&rdquo;</p><p>Jack didn&rsquo;t say anything but the smile on his face never faded as he watched her beam grow. Everyone in the room clapped their hands when the upbeat song ended, then all gathered to the middle of the room as Niall announced a slow song for the couples was next.</p><p>Y/N looked behind her boss with a confused look as she asked,&nbsp;&ldquo;where&rsquo;s Maria?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she couldn&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; he lied, curving his lips into a smile before pointing at Olivia standing by the wall.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I got myself a new dance partner, don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good.&rdquo; Y/N giggled, giving the blonde across the room a little wave as she turned back to Jack.&nbsp;&ldquo;Also, I&rsquo;m very happy that you showed up.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo; He nodded, holding both of her shoulders firmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Congrats, Mrs. Styles.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she replied, giving him one last smile as she watched him return to Olivia. Maybe love didn&rsquo;t have to be a romantic bond between two people. Sometimes, it took form as a bond between two friends, who wanted nothing more than happiness for the other.<br /></p><p><i><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br />You can feel it on the way home, way home</i></i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wifey!&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>Y/N turned around just in time Harry crashed into her arms, squeezing all the air out of his wife with that bear hug. She could guess how much he&rsquo;d drunk because he couldn&rsquo;t stop giggling like a little boy, and his happiness was so contagious that she couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh along. She pulled away a bit to hold his face with both hands. His arms tightened around her waist, keeping her pressed against him so he could whisper into her ear,&nbsp;&ldquo;dance with me.&rdquo;</p><p><i><i>You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br />You are in love, true love</i></i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You finally escaped from the boys, I see.&rdquo; Her arms came wrapped around his neck to start guiding them to the beat of the song.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They literally tried to drown me in vodka even after I&rsquo;d told them I needed to stay sober for you,&rdquo; he said in annoyance, making her giggle. &ldquo;If I disappoint you tonight, it&rsquo;s because I wasted most of my energy on fighting them.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>Morning, his place<br />Burnt toast, Sunday<br />You keep his shirt<br />He keeps his word</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never disappointed me though.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aww that&rsquo;s the first lie you&rsquo;ve told me as my wife.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She smacked him on the arm as both broke into a fit of laughter.</p><p><i>And for once you let go<br />Of your fears and your ghosts<br />One step, not much<br />But it said enough</i><br /></p><p>Harry looked around the room and spotted in the far corner Y/N&rsquo;s two&nbsp;friends from high school John and Violet slow dancing together. John held his pregnant wife like she was the most delicate thing in the world and the sight made Harry&rsquo;s heart flutter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to put a baby inside of you,&rdquo; he blurted, causing Y/N to guffaw.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, are you gonna replace the word &lsquo;sex&rsquo; with &lsquo;putting a baby inside of you&rsquo; from now on?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He bit back a smile and pinched her side playfully.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I want to have a baby with you. A little us.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>You kiss on sidewalks<br />You fight and you talk<br /></i><i><i>One night he wakes<br /></i></i><i><i>Strange look on his face</i></i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been desperate for a baby since you found Treasure though.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes and joked,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to think you married me just to get a human baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Been wanting to marry you since your brother&rsquo;s wedding actually.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>Pauses, then says<br />\"You&rsquo;re my best friend&rdquo;<br />And you knew what it was<br />He is in love</i><br /></p><p>His confession caused her to pull away a bit so they could lock eyes with one another. She stroked his cheeks tenderly and traced her fingertips across his pink lips. Smiling, she said,&nbsp;&ldquo;now that you mention, our first dance was at my brother&rsquo;s wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and now we&rsquo;re dancing at our own. Isn&rsquo;t that great?&rdquo;</p><p><i>So it goes<br />You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round<br />And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown<br />And you understand now why they lost their minds<br />And fought the wars<br />And why I&rsquo;ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you like my vow?&rdquo; He asked with a smug look on his face because he already knew the answer, but wanting to hear it from her still.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it already obvious?&rdquo; She snorted. &ldquo;I weeped like a baby in front of you and everyone.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The only time I was happy that I made you cry.&rdquo; Harry sighed, stroking her sides gently. &ldquo;Hey, baby, I just came up with something I should&rsquo;ve added to my vow.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite already knowing he was going to say something silly, she still nodded and told him to go on. Then with a funny high-pitched voice, he drunkenly sang,<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re so sexy, you&rsquo;re so fine. I&rsquo;m gonna make you mah wife.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N tossed her head back as she laughed and cupped his face between her palms.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t put that in your vow. I would&rsquo;ve returned the ring and walked out immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re regretting this whole thing aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He kissed her cheek, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Y/N flashed a smile and nodded her head quickly to play along with the joke.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Instead of going back home after this, let&rsquo;s go get divorced,&rdquo; she playfully suggested. The pretentious hurt look on his face got her dying on laughter.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but hold on, let me hold my wife a bit longer before she leaves me,&rdquo; said Harry as he kissed her forehead and pulled her in again, mouth at her ear when he whispered,&nbsp;&ldquo;love you to the moon and back.&rdquo;</p><p>With butterflies going wild in her stomach, she also told him,&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you too, forever and always, darling.&rdquo;</p><p><i>You can hear it in the silence, silence<br />You can feel it on the way home, way home<br />You can see it with the lights out, lights out<br />You are in love, true love<br />You are in love<br /></i></p></p>",

He panics, leaping from the bed to run to your en-suite, finding you with your head in the porcelain bowl.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright, darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo; He coos as he leans down to rub soft circles into your lower back.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; You whimper after spitting a remaining blob of bile into the toilet. &ldquo;Something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, feel a bit weird.&rdquo; You mumble, flushing the toilet and standing straight.</p><p>You stumble over to the sink and rinse your mouth out, before proceeding to clean your teeth to remove the taste of sick.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you eaten anything funny, or..?&rdquo; Harry prompts, leaning against the side of the sink and stroking the back of his fingers along your arm.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve been eaten the same as you, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; You ponder, spitting your mouthful of foam into the sink, before rinsing your mouth out again with water and then mouthwash.</p><p>Harry purses his lips and frowns, moving towards you and wrapping his arms around your middle and pressing a firm kiss to your temple.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not until you hiss at the ache in your breasts when he squeezes you that you realise it. &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stares at you wide-eyed, cocking his head a little to the left. &ldquo;What, what is it?&rdquo;</p><p>You wriggle out of his hold to pad over to the bathroom cabinet, pulling out the little box and removing a stick. You turn around with it in your hand, wiggling it so that Harry can see what you&rsquo;re suspecting.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</i> He blinks twice, eyes flitting from the stick to you and back. &ldquo;You think..?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod slowly and swallow the lump in your throat. &ldquo;Yep, I think so.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~</p><p>Babies babies babies</p><p>Tag list: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a>  <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@particularnarry</a> </p>",

I wanted to rewatch the film before I wrote it but I couldn\u2019t find it so I just sorta winged it! THIS IS PURE ANGST. Thoughts please!</b></i></p><p>You haven\u2019t felt it for a while - that awful sickening feeling you get when you\u2019ve seen someone you\u2019re desperately trying to avoid. It\u2019s manifestation in the pit of your stomach has you desperately searching for a way out of this confined space you now find yourself in, backing away out of the door without a second thought for anything you had been doing or for anyone you were with.</p><p>Your friends are calling after you with mirrored frowns, your best friend following after you rather than sticking to her place in the queue. But their chorus of your name hasn\u2019t helped your problem; no, it\u2019s only made it horribly worse.</p><p>Because now, instead of facing away from you and looking at the menu boards above the rows of industrial coffee machines and stacks of Starbucks branded mugs and takeaway cups, Harry has his big green eyes glued to you, an expression eerily similar to yours gracing his eternally beautiful features.</p><p>You break out into a near sprint as you run off, away from your problem and away from your friends. You knew a Starbucks of all places was a bad idea anyway, there was just something about the atmosphere in them that made you feel ill at ease. But seeing Harry in there as well? Nah, you can forget it.</p><p>Trina follows after you, catching up with you after you surrender yourself to a bench in the park you often frequent when you\u2019re having a bit of a shit day - much like you are now. Her arms are around you instantly, tucking your head into the crook of her neck as your sobs take a hold of you.</p><p>Leaving Harry was one of the stupidest things you\u2019ve ever done, and if you could take everything back you would in a heartbeat without a second thought. You\u2019d been selfish; helpless in your relationship through trying times and had no energy to help him. He\u2019d fallen into a strange state of depression - even if he\u2019d never admit it. And you, in your typically resigned fashion didn\u2019t know how to help him. </p><p>Airing problems was something you\u2019d never been good at, admitting feelings that were anything other than love had you running away like you had just now. It was the last thing you should\u2019ve done - leaving him. But you felt incapable of helping him, he seemed helpless.</p><p>Six months had passed since you walked out on him. You hadn\u2019t answered any of his texts or calls, anyone who reached out to you on his behalf had been instantly rejected, and shamefully that included his mother and sister - two people who\u2019d been your rock in any of Harry\u2019s absences in the three years you were together.</p><p>You\u2019d just despised coming home everyday to find him moping on the sofa or in bed, barely able to hold a conversation with you to the point you selfishly got fed up. </p><p>For a while you\u2019d tried to keep your life with a semblance of normality, going from day to day pretending that nothing was wrong. You\u2019d love him the way you always did, be affectionate with him in all the best ways - and all the ways you knew how. There was one week in particular that you think you gave him more blowjobs than you\u2019d given you\u2019re entire relationship (maybe you\u2019re terrible - they scare you a bit), and it still seemed to do nothing for him.</p><p>That\u2019s when the self-doubt started creeping in.</p><p>You\u2019d thought maybe you were the issue - maybe he was fed up of you, bored of you. Were you being clingy? Were you irritating him? You\u2019ve been told before by friends that you can be irritating as fuck, maybe Harry was starting to see it too.</p><p>You thought leaving him was the right thing to do. It didn\u2019t matter that you were still completely taken with him, in love with him to the point it was no doubt unhealthy. The fact that you were so completely stuck in love with him was a big factor in why you left him. You can love someone even though you\u2019re not with them.</p><p>\u201cRuining my shirt, mate.\u201d Trina mumbles into your sudden eerie silence.</p><p>You\u2019d stopped sobbing about five minutes ago, and you\u2019re completely unaware that you\u2019ve been sat here for half an hour now just going back through everything you\u2019ve managed to avoid thinking of for three months.</p><p>You sniff as you paw at your wet eyes with the cuff of your jumper and laugh once, though it\u2019s void of any humour. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t fancy a chat with him then?\u201d She asks expectantly, wiping stray tears from your stained cheeks with her hand as if you\u2019re still a child.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I deserve it. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he fuckin\u2019 hates me - m\u2019horrible.\u201d You mutter, looking from your lap out to the vast parkland ahead of you.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to believe he hates you. You were in love, everyone could see it.\u201d</p><p>You glance back to Trina and pout. It didn\u2019t feel like being in love in those last few months, it was just painful. \u201cI just&hellip; I remember that it hurt seeing him hurt. And I did nothing but run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are exceptionally good at that.\u201d Trina hums, but she hadn\u2019t missed the strain in your voice when you\u2019d spoken. \u201cBut we can all see why you did it, and I don\u2019t doubt any of us would\u2019ve done anything differently if we were in your position.\u201d</p><p>An all too familiar voice states your name behind you, sending a shiver through your entire being. It doesn\u2019t sound angry, it doesn\u2019t sound upset, it\u2019s almost&hellip; relieved?</p><p>You wince at it regardless, sharing a nervous glance with Trina before turning around slowly to look at him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s stood there in a long black coat, holding two takeaway cups in his hand as he watches you with worry. And that\u2019s really all there is; worry. Again, there\u2019s not an ounce of anger or hurt evident on him, he\u2019s just apprehensive with concern.</p><p>Trina gives your hand a gentle squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you both to it.\u201d She whispers delicately, standing from the bench to wander over towards Harry.</p><p>You hear him murmur that the other girls have a drink waiting for her back at the coffee shop, but you\u2019re not looking their way anymore - you\u2019re paying too much attention to the squirrels having an argument in a nearby tree.</p><p>You don\u2019t look up until he actually intrudes your line of sight, setting both cups on the ground. You struggle with something to say, and apparently so does he as you both just stare at one another for a moment.</p><p>He looks good, better than you do for sure. He\u2019s gained a bit of weight back, something you always secretly loved because you always adored his little muffin tops when he wandered around the house in nothing but a pair of pants. His eyes are red, and you wonder what happened between when you left the coffee shop and now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d You whisper, eyes dropping to your lap as you begin to fiddle with the only ring you ever wear. His ring that holds a permanent place on your left thumb because it\u2019s the only place it\u2019ll ever fit. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d</p><p>Your throat has grown tight again, tears spilling over to fall down your face and pool into your lap. You hate yourself for what you did to him, and him being this close to you is not making you feel any better.</p><p>\u201cHey, no.\u201d Harry coos, enveloping around you without thinking twice. His left arms grips you tightly as his right hand strokes over your hair. He\u2019s pressing feather light kisses into your hair, and it\u2019s not helping the sick feeling in your tummy. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was horrible, Harry.\u201d You cry into his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you, you didn\u2019t deserve what I did to you - it wasn\u2019t fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stop it.\u201d He says firmly, pulling back to glide his hands from the top your head to your cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you for leaving, love. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You whine incredulously, wiping more tears from your face. \u201cI should\u2019ve stayed - I should\u2019ve tried to help you. And I didn\u2019t, I just fucked off and left you to deal with it on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m grateful for it.\u201d He says as if it\u2019s obvious. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, angel - I really bloody missed you. Hell, I missed you when we were still together, but I miss you even more now. But you leaving was the best thing for both of us.\u201d</p><p>You stare at him for a moment with a frown and a pout. It makes little sense to you, his logic behind everything - and yet he\u2019s still absolutely certain about it. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t change that I feel absolutely fucking terrible about it, H.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He says simply, stroking along your cheekbone with his left thumb. \u201cIt was the right thing to do. It\u2019s given me time to sort myself out without you having to deal with any more shit from me for it.\u201d</p><p>You stare at him again, because you really are still hopeless for him. That never changed. You\u2019ve missed that weird yet still attractive stubble he grows during his lazy time off, missed his smell which you could recognise from a mile away, missed the colour of his eyes, his dimples when he smiles. You\u2019ve just missed him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know.\u201d Harry speaks again into your silence, his eyes never leaving yours. \u201cAll this time we\u2019ve spent away from each other and I still have absolutely no doubt that I love you. I was gonna marry you, still want to.\u201d</p><p>You produce a sound that can only be described as a welp at his confession, and he\u2019s got you fucking crying again as another fat tear rolls down your cheek. You\u2019re shaking your head in denial, taking in a deep breath. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said why.\u201d He chuckles with a light smile. \u201cI fucking love you. Have done for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>You release a breath and shake your head again, resting your hand on his wrist where he\u2019s still holding your face. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d fuckin\u2019 hope so after all that.\u201d He chuckles again, pressing a kiss to your forehead and then your lips. \u201cHere, I got y\u2019a coffee.\u201d He hums, leaning sideways to hand you the smaller cup. \u201cStill take it black with three sugars?\u201d</p><p>You laugh once, taking the cup from him and pressing your lips into a hard line. You only take three sugars in coffee shops because two is never enough. You\u2019d stopped drinking coffee a few months back, but you weren\u2019t going to ruin the moment by telling that. \u201cYeah, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, pet.\u201d He grins, pressing another kiss to your lips. \u201cFancy a walk?\u201d</p><p>You inhale again and nod with a genuine smile. His smile widens, and he stands tall with an offer for you to take his hand.</p><p>So you do.</p><p>~~~</p><p>I kinda like this idk?</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@particularnarry</a> </p>",

            "comment": "<p><i><b>PETAL! This has been sat in my inbox for the longest effing time and I am so effing sorry! I wanted to rewatch the film before I wrote it but I couldn\u2019t find it so I just sorta winged it! THIS IS PURE ANGST. Thoughts please!</b></i></p><p>You haven\u2019t felt it for a while - that awful sickening feeling you get when you\u2019ve seen someone you\u2019re desperately trying to avoid. It\u2019s manifestation in the pit of your stomach has you desperately searching for a way out of this confined space you now find yourself in, backing away out of the door without a second thought for anything you had been doing or for anyone you were with.</p><p>Your friends are calling after you with mirrored frowns, your best friend following after you rather than sticking to her place in the queue. But their chorus of your name hasn\u2019t helped your problem; no, it\u2019s only made it horribly worse.</p><p>Because now, instead of facing away from you and looking at the menu boards above the rows of industrial coffee machines and stacks of Starbucks branded mugs and takeaway cups, Harry has his big green eyes glued to you, an expression eerily similar to yours gracing his eternally beautiful features.</p><p>You break out into a near sprint as you run off, away from your problem and away from your friends. You knew a Starbucks of all places was a bad idea anyway, there was just something about the atmosphere in them that made you feel ill at ease. But seeing Harry in there as well? Nah, you can forget it.</p><p>Trina follows after you, catching up with you after you surrender yourself to a bench in the park you often frequent when you\u2019re having a bit of a shit day - much like you are now. Her arms are around you instantly, tucking your head into the crook of her neck as your sobs take a hold of you.</p><p>Leaving Harry was one of the stupidest things you\u2019ve ever done, and if you could take everything back you would in a heartbeat without a second thought. You\u2019d been selfish; helpless in your relationship through trying times and had no energy to help him. He\u2019d fallen into a strange state of depression - even if he\u2019d never admit it. And you, in your typically resigned fashion didn\u2019t know how to help him. </p><p>Airing problems was something you\u2019d never been good at, admitting feelings that were anything other than love had you running away like you had just now. It was the last thing you should\u2019ve done - leaving him. But you felt incapable of helping him, he seemed helpless.</p><p>Six months had passed since you walked out on him. You hadn\u2019t answered any of his texts or calls, anyone who reached out to you on his behalf had been instantly rejected, and shamefully that included his mother and sister - two people who\u2019d been your rock in any of Harry\u2019s absences in the three years you were together.</p><p>You\u2019d just despised coming home everyday to find him moping on the sofa or in bed, barely able to hold a conversation with you to the point you selfishly got fed up. </p><p>For a while you\u2019d tried to keep your life with a semblance of normality, going from day to day pretending that nothing was wrong. You\u2019d love him the way you always did, be affectionate with him in all the best ways - and all the ways you knew how. There was one week in particular that you think you gave him more blowjobs than you\u2019d given you\u2019re entire relationship (maybe you\u2019re terrible - they scare you a bit), and it still seemed to do nothing for him.</p><p>That\u2019s when the self-doubt started creeping in.</p><p>You\u2019d thought maybe you were the issue - maybe he was fed up of you, bored of you. Were you being clingy? Were you irritating him? You\u2019ve been told before by friends that you can be irritating as fuck, maybe Harry was starting to see it too.</p><p>You thought leaving him was the right thing to do. It didn\u2019t matter that you were still completely taken with him, in love with him to the point it was no doubt unhealthy. The fact that you were so completely stuck in love with him was a big factor in why you left him. You can love someone even though you\u2019re not with them.</p><p>\u201cRuining my shirt, mate.\u201d Trina mumbles into your sudden eerie silence.</p><p>You\u2019d stopped sobbing about five minutes ago, and you\u2019re completely unaware that you\u2019ve been sat here for half an hour now just going back through everything you\u2019ve managed to avoid thinking of for three months.</p><p>You sniff as you paw at your wet eyes with the cuff of your jumper and laugh once, though it\u2019s void of any humour. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t fancy a chat with him then?\u201d She asks expectantly, wiping stray tears from your stained cheeks with her hand as if you\u2019re still a child.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I deserve it. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he fuckin\u2019 hates me - m\u2019horrible.\u201d You mutter, looking from your lap out to the vast parkland ahead of you.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to believe he hates you. You were in love, everyone could see it.\u201d</p><p>You glance back to Trina and pout. It didn\u2019t feel like being in love in those last few months, it was just painful. \u201cI just\u2026 I remember that it hurt seeing him hurt. And I did nothing but run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are exceptionally good at that.\u201d Trina hums, but she hadn\u2019t missed the strain in your voice when you\u2019d spoken. \u201cBut we can all see why you did it, and I don\u2019t doubt any of us would\u2019ve done anything differently if we were in your position.\u201d</p><p>An all too familiar voice states your name behind you, sending a shiver through your entire being. It doesn\u2019t sound angry, it doesn\u2019t sound upset, it\u2019s almost\u2026 relieved?</p><p>You wince at it regardless, sharing a nervous glance with Trina before turning around slowly to look at him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s stood there in a long black coat, holding two takeaway cups in his hand as he watches you with worry. And that\u2019s really all there is; worry. Again, there\u2019s not an ounce of anger or hurt evident on him, he\u2019s just apprehensive with concern.</p><p>Trina gives your hand a gentle squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you both to it.\u201d She whispers delicately, standing from the bench to wander over towards Harry.</p><p>You hear him murmur that the other girls have a drink waiting for her back at the coffee shop, but you\u2019re not looking their way anymore - you\u2019re paying too much attention to the squirrels having an argument in a nearby tree.</p><p>You don\u2019t look up until he actually intrudes your line of sight, setting both cups on the ground.

I wanted to rewatch the film before I wrote it but I couldn\u2019t find it so I just sorta winged it! THIS IS PURE ANGST. Thoughts please!</b></i></p><p>You haven\u2019t felt it for a while - that awful sickening feeling you get when you\u2019ve seen someone you\u2019re desperately trying to avoid. It\u2019s manifestation in the pit of your stomach has you desperately searching for a way out of this confined space you now find yourself in, backing away out of the door without a second thought for anything you had been doing or for anyone you were with.</p><p>Your friends are calling after you with mirrored frowns, your best friend following after you rather than sticking to her place in the queue. But their chorus of your name hasn\u2019t helped your problem; no, it\u2019s only made it horribly worse.</p><p>Because now, instead of facing away from you and looking at the menu boards above the rows of industrial coffee machines and stacks of Starbucks branded mugs and takeaway cups, Harry has his big green eyes glued to you, an expression eerily similar to yours gracing his eternally beautiful features.</p><p>You break out into a near sprint as you run off, away from your problem and away from your friends. You knew a Starbucks of all places was a bad idea anyway, there was just something about the atmosphere in them that made you feel ill at ease. But seeing Harry in there as well? Nah, you can forget it.</p><p>Trina follows after you, catching up with you after you surrender yourself to a bench in the park you often frequent when you\u2019re having a bit of a shit day - much like you are now. Her arms are around you instantly, tucking your head into the crook of her neck as your sobs take a hold of you.</p><p>Leaving Harry was one of the stupidest things you\u2019ve ever done, and if you could take everything back you would in a heartbeat without a second thought. You\u2019d been selfish; helpless in your relationship through trying times and had no energy to help him. He\u2019d fallen into a strange state of depression - even if he\u2019d never admit it. And you, in your typically resigned fashion didn\u2019t know how to help him. </p><p>Airing problems was something you\u2019d never been good at, admitting feelings that were anything other than love had you running away like you had just now. It was the last thing you should\u2019ve done - leaving him. But you felt incapable of helping him, he seemed helpless.</p><p>Six months had passed since you walked out on him. You hadn\u2019t answered any of his texts or calls, anyone who reached out to you on his behalf had been instantly rejected, and shamefully that included his mother and sister - two people who\u2019d been your rock in any of Harry\u2019s absences in the three years you were together.</p><p>You\u2019d just despised coming home everyday to find him moping on the sofa or in bed, barely able to hold a conversation with you to the point you selfishly got fed up. </p><p>For a while you\u2019d tried to keep your life with a semblance of normality, going from day to day pretending that nothing was wrong. You\u2019d love him the way you always did, be affectionate with him in all the best ways - and all the ways you knew how. There was one week in particular that you think you gave him more blowjobs than you\u2019d given you\u2019re entire relationship (maybe you\u2019re terrible - they scare you a bit), and it still seemed to do nothing for him.</p><p>That\u2019s when the self-doubt started creeping in.</p><p>You\u2019d thought maybe you were the issue - maybe he was fed up of you, bored of you. Were you being clingy? Were you irritating him? You\u2019ve been told before by friends that you can be irritating as fuck, maybe Harry was starting to see it too.</p><p>You thought leaving him was the right thing to do. It didn\u2019t matter that you were still completely taken with him, in love with him to the point it was no doubt unhealthy. The fact that you were so completely stuck in love with him was a big factor in why you left him. You can love someone even though you\u2019re not with them.</p><p>\u201cRuining my shirt, mate.\u201d Trina mumbles into your sudden eerie silence.</p><p>You\u2019d stopped sobbing about five minutes ago, and you\u2019re completely unaware that you\u2019ve been sat here for half an hour now just going back through everything you\u2019ve managed to avoid thinking of for three months.</p><p>You sniff as you paw at your wet eyes with the cuff of your jumper and laugh once, though it\u2019s void of any humour. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t fancy a chat with him then?\u201d She asks expectantly, wiping stray tears from your stained cheeks with her hand as if you\u2019re still a child.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I deserve it. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he fuckin\u2019 hates me - m\u2019horrible.\u201d You mutter, looking from your lap out to the vast parkland ahead of you.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to believe he hates you. You were in love, everyone could see it.\u201d</p><p>You glance back to Trina and pout. It didn\u2019t feel like being in love in those last few months, it was just painful. \u201cI just\u2026 I remember that it hurt seeing him hurt. And I did nothing but run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are exceptionally good at that.\u201d Trina hums, but she hadn\u2019t missed the strain in your voice when you\u2019d spoken. \u201cBut we can all see why you did it, and I don\u2019t doubt any of us would\u2019ve done anything differently if we were in your position.\u201d</p><p>An all too familiar voice states your name behind you, sending a shiver through your entire being. It doesn\u2019t sound angry, it doesn\u2019t sound upset, it\u2019s almost\u2026 relieved?</p><p>You wince at it regardless, sharing a nervous glance with Trina before turning around slowly to look at him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s stood there in a long black coat, holding two takeaway cups in his hand as he watches you with worry. And that\u2019s really all there is; worry. Again, there\u2019s not an ounce of anger or hurt evident on him, he\u2019s just apprehensive with concern.</p><p>Trina gives your hand a gentle squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you both to it.\u201d She whispers delicately, standing from the bench to wander over towards Harry.</p><p>You hear him murmur that the other girls have a drink waiting for her back at the coffee shop, but you\u2019re not looking their way anymore - you\u2019re paying too much attention to the squirrels having an argument in a nearby tree.</p><p>You don\u2019t look up until he actually intrudes your line of sight, setting both cups on the ground. You struggle with something to say, and apparently so does he as you both just stare at one another for a moment.</p><p>He looks good, better than you do for sure. He\u2019s gained a bit of weight back, something you always secretly loved because you always adored his little muffin tops when he wandered around the house in nothing but a pair of pants. His eyes are red, and you wonder what happened between when you left the coffee shop and now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d You whisper, eyes dropping to your lap as you begin to fiddle with the only ring you ever wear. His ring that holds a permanent place on your left thumb because it\u2019s the only place it\u2019ll ever fit. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d</p><p>Your throat has grown tight again, tears spilling over to fall down your face and pool into your lap. You hate yourself for what you did to him, and him being this close to you is not making you feel any better.</p><p>\u201cHey, no.\u201d Harry coos, enveloping around you without thinking twice. His left arms grips you tightly as his right hand strokes over your hair. He\u2019s pressing feather light kisses into your hair, and it\u2019s not helping the sick feeling in your tummy. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was horrible, Harry.\u201d You cry into his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you, you didn\u2019t deserve what I did to you - it wasn\u2019t fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stop it.\u201d He says firmly, pulling back to glide his hands from the top your head to your cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you for leaving, love. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You whine incredulously, wiping more tears from your face. \u201cI should\u2019ve stayed - I should\u2019ve tried to help you. And I didn\u2019t, I just fucked off and left you to deal with it on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m grateful for it.\u201d He says as if it\u2019s obvious. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, angel - I really bloody missed you. Hell, I missed you when we were still together, but I miss you even more now. But you leaving was the best thing for both of us.\u201d</p><p>You stare at him for a moment with a frown and a pout. It makes little sense to you, his logic behind everything - and yet he\u2019s still absolutely certain about it. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t change that I feel absolutely fucking terrible about it, H.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He says simply, stroking along your cheekbone with his left thumb. \u201cIt was the right thing to do. It\u2019s given me time to sort myself out without you having to deal with any more shit from me for it.\u201d</p><p>You stare at him again, because you really are still hopeless for him. That never changed. You\u2019ve missed that weird yet still attractive stubble he grows during his lazy time off, missed his smell which you could recognise from a mile away, missed the colour of his eyes, his dimples when he smiles. You\u2019ve just missed him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know.\u201d Harry speaks again into your silence, his eyes never leaving yours. \u201cAll this time we\u2019ve spent away from each other and I still have absolutely no doubt that I love you. I was gonna marry you, still want to.\u201d</p><p>You produce a sound that can only be described as a welp at his confession, and he\u2019s got you fucking crying again as another fat tear rolls down your cheek. You\u2019re shaking your head in denial, taking in a deep breath. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said why.\u201d He chuckles with a light smile. \u201cI fucking love you. Have done for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>You release a breath and shake your head again, resting your hand on his wrist where he\u2019s still holding your face. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d fuckin\u2019 hope so after all that.\u201d He chuckles again, pressing a kiss to your forehead and then your lips. \u201cHere, I got y\u2019a coffee.\u201d He hums, leaning sideways to hand you the smaller cup. \u201cStill take it black with three sugars?\u201d</p><p>You laugh once, taking the cup from him and pressing your lips into a hard line. You only take three sugars in coffee shops because two is never enough. You\u2019d stopped drinking coffee a few months back, but you weren\u2019t going to ruin the moment by telling that. \u201cYeah, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, pet.\u201d He grins, pressing another kiss to your lips. \u201cFancy a walk?\u201d</p><p>You inhale again and nod with a genuine smile. His smile widens, and he stands tall with an offer for you to take his hand.</p><p>So you do.</p><p>~~~</p><p>I kinda like this idk?</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@particularnarry</a> </p>",

Have done for a very long time.&rdquo;</p><p>You release a breath and shake your head again, resting your hand on his wrist where he&rsquo;s still holding your face. &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d fuckin&rsquo; hope so after all that.&rdquo; He chuckles again, pressing a kiss to your forehead and then your lips. &ldquo;Here, I got y&rsquo;a coffee.&rdquo; He hums, leaning sideways to hand you the smaller cup. &ldquo;Still take it black with three sugars?&rdquo;</p><p>You laugh once, taking the cup from him and pressing your lips into a hard line. You only take three sugars in coffee shops because two is never enough. You&rsquo;d stopped drinking coffee a few months back, but you weren&rsquo;t going to ruin the moment by telling that. &ldquo;Yeah, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My pleasure, pet.&rdquo; He grins, pressing another kiss to your lips. &ldquo;Fancy a walk?&rdquo;</p><p>You inhale again and nod with a genuine smile. His smile widens, and he stands tall with an offer for you to take his hand.</p><p>So you do.</p><p>~~~</p><p>I kinda like this idk?</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@particularnarry</a> </p>",
