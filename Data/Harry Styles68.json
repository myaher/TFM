        "body": "<h2>A Really Fluffy Concept<br/></h2><p>Honestly, I think sharing a bed with Harry would probably be the best thing in the world. Like literally. Just imagine having him next to you, there all night, the last person you see before you fall asleep and the first person you see when you wake up.</p><p>Imagine him cuddling you until you fall asleep. On some days, he\u2019d be spooning you, having one arm draped around your tummy while the other was resting just beneath the pillow so it wouldn\u2019t be in the way of things. He\u2019d whisper \u201cgoodnight, my love\u201d, with this deep, raspy voice of his, sleep already evident. Then he\u2019d kiss you on the temple, his hand tracing little circles onto your tummy. You\u2019d lean onto him more and more, so there\u2019d be as little space as possible between you.</p><p>On other days, he\u2019d be the little spoon, burrying himself deep in the duvet. You\u2019d hold him, your head in the crook of his neck from behind. Your feet would be tangled together. He\u2019d just enjoy the feeling of being held and you\u2019d be happily offering him the feeling of safety and warmth and comfort, just like you\u2019d feel when he held you. <br/></p><p>Then, there were days that where you\u2019d just wanted to face each other, so you laid in bed, both laying on your sides, your feet touching but the rest of your bodies only inches apart. You\u2019d brush a few curls out of his face to have a proper look at his eyes before closing yours for the night. He\u2019d kiss your forehead and sometimes your nose, enjoying how you\u2019d scrunch up your own nose.</p><p>And sometimes, you were okay to fall asleep without cuddling, so you and him would be laying all comfortable by yourselves, but you\u2019d never be that far apart, so when you or him woke up in the middle of the night, you\u2019d only have to reach out to feel the other.</p><p>Your personal favourite (and his, he\u2019d just refuse to tell you) were the nights were you read to each other. You\u2019d share a book, you\u2019d only read it together. Once, he caught you cheating because you fell asleep at a particularly thrilling plot twist, so you thought you\u2019d read it in the morning while he was still asleep next to you, but he woke up and saw you. And boy, was he mad. He barely talked to you until lunch. So when you\u2019d read together, one would read out loud, sometimes it was him, sometimes it was you. The unspoken rule was that the reader also had to turn off the light, too. <br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"pleasingpics:6STxS1vJyRoS8qYrc0kfcw:Zjf9mv2aDvXCV\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/632aa99e4a5bf5f6caeca6be4ddd0801/tumblr_pb8zpxBzes1rrugpso1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Read all of my posts <a href=\"http://harrys-green-fruit.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><i><b>here </b></i></a>or request something <a href=\"http://harrys-green-fruit.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><i><b>here</b></i></a>.<br/></p>",

Harry was in LA and they texted almost every day. Darcy started working immediately when she got back home. Her first collection was about the launch in a few months and there was a lot to do until that. She mostly worked alone, sometimes with her favorite students, but she loved the old workhouse that her parents built. There was fabric all around and sketches. She embroidered a skirt when her phone rang. It was about 7 pm when Harry called her. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she shouted happily.</p><p>\u201cHi, darling. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks! You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, you know the Carpool Karaokes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. I love James\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 we\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! You did the Carpool Karaoke???\u201d she asked in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhen will it air?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTonight. That\u2019s why I called you. So you will surely see it\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cThank you! I will watch it, uhm\u2026 like tomorrow\u201d she looked at her watch and counted the hours.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Of course, the time difference. What are you up to anyway?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on a skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I love working alone. It\u2019s peaceful and it\u2019s gonna be surely like I want it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Working in peace. All by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess in the near future you\u2019re gonna be working kind of alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t bring that up,\u201d he said with faked hurt in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Will you come back to the UK soon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you miss me?\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDuh, yes\u201d she smiled too. </p><p>\u201cI wanna go back to the UK but only to pick you up and go somewhere neither of us has been\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow! Harry Styles, you are a spontaneous man\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. I saw pictures of a red sand beach on Maui, Hawaii\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re serious\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am. Do you wanna come?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean why not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat! I&rsquo;ll book tickets, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything just pack and I&rsquo;ll be there on Monday. We&rsquo;ll leave on Tuesday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d </p><p>With that, she agreed to go to Maui with Harry. It was so spontaneous. It took a few days for her to arrange everything for a two weeks leaves, but all of it was fine. Her aunt and uncle were happy that she goes out more. Harry arrived very early on Monday morning. </p><p>She was early in the workplace because she had to finish a shirt before leaving. It wasn&rsquo;t for the collection. It was for Harry. She designed and sew him a shirt. It wasn&rsquo;t regular, it was like a medieval prince&rsquo;s shirt. It was white with frilled stand collar and it was bishop sleeved. It was light and beautiful. She wrapped it in silk paper and put it in a box. She hurried back to her flat where Harry was already waiting by the door. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d She yelled at him and rushed into his arms. They hugged for long seconds. </p><p>\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d he said softly. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn&rsquo;t you call you&rsquo;re here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve just arrived a minute ago. What&rsquo;s that box?\u201d He had childish curiosity on his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s none of your business &hellip;yet\u201d she winked. As they went inside, Harry saw that she&rsquo;s already completely packed up. She was just waiting for him. </p><p>\u201cI have some things to do before we leave,\u201d Harry said as he placed himself on the couch. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Me too\u201d she shouted from the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll only be back when I&rsquo;ll pick you up to go to the airport,\u201d he said while playing with the hem of his t-shirt. </p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s fine\u201d she smiled as she walked in with a tray in her hands. They started drinking the tea.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I need to get my head clear,\u201d he said not looking at her. </p><p>\u201cI get it. You haven&rsquo;t stopped for years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, and why not spend it with a beautiful girl?\u201d he smirked at his own comment. </p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t flirt with me\u201d she stated. </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I&rsquo;m not buying it. Look, Harry you&rsquo;re gorgeous, in and out, but my life is complicated enough. We&rsquo;re already rumored. And even though it&rsquo;s fun, I don&rsquo;t want a romantic/physical relationship of any kind. I want you as a good friend because that&rsquo;s what my first instinct tells me to\u201d she was firm. She meant what she said. </p><p>\u201cNoted\u201d Harry shortly said and sipped his tea. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m serious\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe too. I won&rsquo;t be flirting with you constantly. Only occasionally\u201d he smiled. Darcy rolled her eyes. </p><p>\u201cOh god! I&rsquo;m not even your type!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what&rsquo;s my type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlonde, supermodel body, laugh on your bad jokes\u2026\u201d he rolled his eyes after the first two. </p><p>\u201cYou laugh on my bad jokes\u201d he exclaimed. </p><p>\u201cRemember when a week ago I hung up because you told a terrible joke?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was hurt for days\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut! That&rsquo;s not really my type for a long-term relationship. And I promise I&rsquo;ll be as friendly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because you&rsquo;re more like a brother to me, Harry,\u201d Darcy said softly. </p><p>\u201cOkay! You killed all the romance\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d she laughed. </p><p>Harry left after he finished his tea, he had some things to arrange before he leaves. She stayed in her flat looking at pictures of Hawaii and thinking about all the adventures they will go on. </p><p>What she said to Harry was true. She needed a family, a brother more than a boyfriend. And she knew that under the charmer there&rsquo;s a boy who needs a friend more like a girlfriend. Harry knew that too, but he wanted to try. Darcy was a beautiful girl after all.</p><p>She went into the workhouse for the last time to make sure everything goes well while she won&rsquo;t be there. Her right hand, Julieta was there. She asked her to be in charge in her absence. Julietta was an Italian girl, studying fashion design in London. The two girls were very different but their fashion taste was kind of the same. Darcy asked her to work with her as a student. Soon she was the best among the others and Julieta was in charge of a lot of things in the workhouse, she trained the new students. </p><p>Julietta didn&rsquo;t know about Harry, she didn&rsquo;t know that Darcy flies away to Hawaii with him. She only knew that she&rsquo;s going on holiday for two weeks. Only a few people knew about it. Except for the rumors after the AMAs, but Darcy soon confirmed among her friends that she does know Harry Styles, but they are not dating. They&rsquo;ve just met at an award show. That happens. You can just run into Harry Styles at a music award show. But not everyone became his friend\u2026</p><p>Harry arrived at 2 am. She was all packed already and haven&rsquo;t slept a bit because of the excitement. Harry helped with her bags and in ten minutes the door was closed and abandoned for two weeks. </p><p>They went to Heathrow and Harry said a friend will pick his car up, so he just left it in the parking lot. </p><p>When she started walking to the entrance Harry grabbed her hand. </p><p>\u201cI know a shorter way\u201d he smiled. Being Harry Styles gave him the privilege to skip lines and go in back entrances. They had a security check and then they waited in a private waiting area with a Starbucks and fancy restaurant and a luxury shop like a mini Harrods. </p><p>They had their handbags with them as they entered the plane&rsquo;s first class. He asked for privacy. </p><p>The flight was long and they had to change at JFK. It was tiring, but by skipping the long lines it was fun after all. At the very end of the flight, Darcy looked out of the window and gasped at the sight of the always sunny islands. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she said as she turned to Harry. </p><p>It took two hours to get out of the airport and get to the hotel you were staying. Harry checked in while you waited for him in the hall with the bags. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Come on! Let\u2019s see the room\u201d he said as he got back. </p><p>\u201cThe room? Do we share a room?\u201d she asked while grabbing her bag and going after Harry. </p><p>\u201cWhy? What did you think?\u201d he asked with a smirk. When he opened the door, she saw that there\u2019s only one bed in the room. A king size double bed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping on that with you\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard that sentence before\u201d she rolled her eyes on his words. \u201cKeep calm I\u2019m in the room next door.\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cBut the rooms can be opened,\u201d he said as he walked into her room and opened another door and went into his own.</p><p>\u201cMuch better\u201d she mumbled. </p><p>For a few minutes, she just walked around the hotel room. It was luxurious and beautiful. And the view from the balcony was incredible. They packed their stuff in the closets and around the rooms. The doors stayed open so they could hear each other.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is what we\u2019re gonna do,\u201d he said as he sat down next to her on the balcony. He held up a paper.</p><p>\u201cIs this a schedule?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but all of them are optional, but available for us\u201d he replied. </p><p>\u201cOkay. I think I really want to go to the beach first,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGreat option, third page: Beaches\u201d he was enthusiastic and she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cTonight, this beach?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSkinny dipping?\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m gonna throw you down from this balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy! It was a joke\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, and after that, we\u2019ll have dinner at the restaurant\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat idea\u201d she smiled. He left the room, but a few minutes later he came back with a towel resting on his arm and in tiny yellow swimming shorts, which caused Darcy to almost choke on her drink when she looked up. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the beach now. If you wanna come, I\u2019ll wait\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes. And get out!\u201d she said and pushed him back into his room. She closed the doors and took her swimsuit out of her closet along with a towel and flip-flops. She put on denim shorts too. They were ready to go and tried to find a place where there weren\u2019t too many people. Harry made himself a man-bun and tried to hide behind his sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you try to cover your face that much. That\u2019s the last thing right now that would make people recognize you\u201d she chuckled and looked at his tattooed body. \u201cYou\u2019 should\u2019ve put on a robe instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s an abandoned little bay there,\u201d he said ignoring the truth she just said. </p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s abandoned for a reason\u201d she mumbled. But they went there and hid behind bushes to lie down to sunbathe and get some rest. She stood up after ten minutes, looking for something to do. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmhmh\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you..?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel it\u201d </p><p>They both went walking which was silent for a few minutes. </p><p>\u201cLook, Harry I gotta ask something, but I don\u2019t know how to say it nicely\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the rumors that you\u2019re dating Kendall Jenner\u201d she stayed silent to wait for an answer but Harry just chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is the question?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you two are really dating or you have something for her why are you with me on Hawaii for two weeks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating officially with Kendall, but we might be something\u2026 I like you, you\u2019re my friend and I felt I need to get my head out of things and I didn\u2019t want anyone else besides me but you. Look, it might sound rude, but you barely know me, and it feels amazing. For all the years everyone I met knew more things about me than I did about myself. I\u2019m tired. I wanted to spend my time with someone I\u2019d really enjoy because we don\u2019t run the same circles again and again.\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d she said. She stopped and he did the same. She reached out and hugged him. It was a purely genuine interaction between them. When they parted she looked straight into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there when you break up\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d he said sarcastically, but they both laughed. When they got back to their spot, they went into the water and fooled around for an hour. They got out and stayed until the sun started setting. They watched the sunset sitting on the beach.</p><p>When they got back and prepared themselves for the dinner, Harry knocked on their shared door. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready, hun?\u201d he asked through the door. </p><p>\u201cJust a second\u201d she fixed her necklace for one last time. She opened the door and made him drop his jaws.</p><p>\u201cYou are incredibly beautiful, Darcy Adams\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh shut up\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>They went down to the luxurious restaurant and Harry got them a quiet table.

He smiled and his face lit up as a little boy\u2019s face. He carefully opened it. He tried to tell what it is, but he had to take it out fully.</p><p>\u201cOh my! This is beautiful\u201d he said. He observed the delicate fabric in his hands. </p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d she asked. </p><p>\u201cAre you joking? This is my favorite piece of clothes already.\u201d he smiled and pulled her into a hug. </p><p>\u201cI designed, sewed and decorated it myself,\u201d she told him. </p><p>\u201cYou are incredible\u201d he kissed her cheek. </p>",

Harry was in LA and they texted almost every day. Darcy started working immediately when she got back home. Her first collection was about the launch in a few months and there was a lot to do until that. She mostly worked alone, sometimes with her favorite students, but she loved the old workhouse that her parents built. There was fabric all around and sketches. She embroidered a skirt when her phone rang. It was about 7 pm when Harry called her. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she shouted happily.</p><p>\u201cHi, darling. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks! You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, you know the Carpool Karaokes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course. I love James\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 we\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! You did the Carpool Karaoke???\u201d she asked in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhen will it air?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTonight. That\u2019s why I called you. So you will surely see it\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cThank you! I will watch it, uhm\u2026 like tomorrow\u201d she looked at her watch and counted the hours.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Of course, the time difference. What are you up to anyway?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on a skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I love working alone. It\u2019s peaceful and it\u2019s gonna be surely like I want it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Working in peace. All by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess in the near future you\u2019re gonna be working kind of alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t bring that up,\u201d he said with faked hurt in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Will you come back to the UK soon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you miss me?\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDuh, yes\u201d she smiled too. </p><p>\u201cI wanna go back to the UK but only to pick you up and go somewhere neither of us has been\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow! Harry Styles, you are a spontaneous man\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. I saw pictures of a red sand beach on Maui, Hawaii\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am. Do you wanna come?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean why not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll book tickets, you don\u2019t have to do anything just pack and I\u2019ll be there on Monday. We\u2019ll leave on Tuesday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d </p><p>With that, she agreed to go to Maui with Harry. It was so spontaneous. It took a few days for her to arrange everything for a two weeks leaves, but all of it was fine. Her aunt and uncle were happy that she goes out more. Harry arrived very early on Monday morning. </p><p>She was early in the workplace because she had to finish a shirt before leaving. It wasn\u2019t for the collection. It was for Harry. She designed and sew him a shirt. It wasn\u2019t regular, it was like a medieval prince\u2019s shirt. It was white with frilled stand collar and it was bishop sleeved. It was light and beautiful. She wrapped it in silk paper and put it in a box. She hurried back to her flat where Harry was already waiting by the door. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d She yelled at him and rushed into his arms. They hugged for long seconds. </p><p>\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d he said softly. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call you\u2019re here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived a minute ago. What\u2019s that box?\u201d He had childish curiosity on his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business \u2026yet\u201d she winked. As they went inside, Harry saw that she\u2019s already completely packed up. She was just waiting for him. </p><p>\u201cI have some things to do before we leave,\u201d Harry said as he placed himself on the couch. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Me too\u201d she shouted from the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be back when I\u2019ll pick you up to go to the airport,\u201d he said while playing with the hem of his t-shirt. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine\u201d she smiled as she walked in with a tray in her hands. They started drinking the tea.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I need to get my head clear,\u201d he said not looking at her. </p><p>\u201cI get it. You haven\u2019t stopped for years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, and why not spend it with a beautiful girl?\u201d he smirked at his own comment. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flirt with me\u201d she stated. </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not buying it. Look, Harry you\u2019re gorgeous, in and out, but my life is complicated enough. We\u2019re already rumored. And even though it\u2019s fun, I don\u2019t want a romantic/physical relationship of any kind. I want you as a good friend because that\u2019s what my first instinct tells me to\u201d she was firm. She meant what she said. </p><p>\u201cNoted\u201d Harry shortly said and sipped his tea. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe too. I won\u2019t be flirting with you constantly. Only occasionally\u201d he smiled. Darcy rolled her eyes. </p><p>\u201cOh god! I\u2019m not even your type!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s my type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlonde, supermodel body, laugh on your bad jokes\u2026\u201d he rolled his eyes after the first two. </p><p>\u201cYou laugh on my bad jokes\u201d he exclaimed. </p><p>\u201cRemember when a week ago I hung up because you told a terrible joke?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was hurt for days\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut! That\u2019s not really my type for a long-term relationship. And I promise I\u2019ll be as friendly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because you\u2019re more like a brother to me, Harry,\u201d Darcy said softly. </p><p>\u201cOkay! You killed all the romance\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d she laughed. </p><p>Harry left after he finished his tea, he had some things to arrange before he leaves. She stayed in her flat looking at pictures of Hawaii and thinking about all the adventures they will go on. </p><p>What she said to Harry was true. She needed a family, a brother more than a boyfriend. And she knew that under the charmer there\u2019s a boy who needs a friend more like a girlfriend. Harry knew that too, but he wanted to try. Darcy was a beautiful girl after all.</p><p>She went into the workhouse for the last time to make sure everything goes well while she won\u2019t be there. Her right hand, Julieta was there. She asked her to be in charge in her absence. Julietta was an Italian girl, studying fashion design in London. The two girls were very different but their fashion taste was kind of the same. Darcy asked her to work with her as a student. Soon she was the best among the others and Julieta was in charge of a lot of things in the workhouse, she trained the new students. </p><p>Julietta didn\u2019t know about Harry, she didn\u2019t know that Darcy flies away to Hawaii with him. She only knew that she\u2019s going on holiday for two weeks. Only a few people knew about it. Except for the rumors after the AMAs, but Darcy soon confirmed among her friends that she does know Harry Styles, but they are not dating. They\u2019ve just met at an award show. That happens. You can just run into Harry Styles at a music award show. But not everyone became his friend\u2026</p><p>Harry arrived at 2 am. She was all packed already and haven\u2019t slept a bit because of the excitement. Harry helped with her bags and in ten minutes the door was closed and abandoned for two weeks. </p><p>They went to Heathrow and Harry said a friend will pick his car up, so he just left it in the parking lot. </p><p>When she started walking to the entrance Harry grabbed her hand. </p><p>\u201cI know a shorter way\u201d he smiled. Being Harry Styles gave him the privilege to skip lines and go in back entrances. They had a security check and then they waited in a private waiting area with a Starbucks and fancy restaurant and a luxury shop like a mini Harrods. </p><p>They had their handbags with them as they entered the plane\u2019s first class. He asked for privacy. </p><p>The flight was long and they had to change at JFK. It was tiring, but by skipping the long lines it was fun after all. At the very end of the flight, Darcy looked out of the window and gasped at the sight of the always sunny islands. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she said as she turned to Harry. </p><p>It took two hours to get out of the airport and get to the hotel you were staying. Harry checked in while you waited for him in the hall with the bags. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Come on! Let\u2019s see the room\u201d he said as he got back. </p><p>\u201cThe room? Do we share a room?\u201d she asked while grabbing her bag and going after Harry. </p><p>\u201cWhy? What did you think?\u201d he asked with a smirk. When he opened the door, she saw that there\u2019s only one bed in the room. A king size double bed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping on that with you\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard that sentence before\u201d she rolled her eyes on his words. \u201cKeep calm I\u2019m in the room next door.\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cBut the rooms can be opened,\u201d he said as he walked into her room and opened another door and went into his own.</p><p>\u201cMuch better\u201d she mumbled. </p><p>For a few minutes, she just walked around the hotel room. It was luxurious and beautiful. And the view from the balcony was incredible. They packed their stuff in the closets and around the rooms. The doors stayed open so they could hear each other.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is what we\u2019re gonna do,\u201d he said as he sat down next to her on the balcony. He held up a paper.</p><p>\u201cIs this a schedule?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but all of them are optional, but available for us\u201d he replied. </p><p>\u201cOkay.

It was a joke\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, and after that, we\u2019ll have dinner at the restaurant\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat idea\u201d she smiled. He left the room, but a few minutes later he came back with a towel resting on his arm and in tiny yellow swimming shorts, which caused Darcy to almost choke on her drink when she looked up. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the beach now.

But they went there and hid behind bushes to lie down to sunbathe and get some rest. She stood up after ten minutes, looking for something to do. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmhmh\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you..?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel it\u201d </p><p>They both went walking which was silent for a few minutes. </p><p>\u201cLook, Harry I gotta ask something, but I don\u2019t know how to say it nicely\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the rumors that you\u2019re dating Kendall Jenner\u201d she stayed silent to wait for an answer but Harry just chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is the question?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you two are really dating or you have something for her why are you with me on Hawaii for two weeks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating officially with Kendall, but we might be something\u2026 I like you, you\u2019re my friend and I felt I need to get my head out of things and I didn\u2019t want anyone else besides me but you.

Harry was in LA and they texted almost every day. Darcy started working immediately when she got back home. Her first collection was about the launch in a few months and there was a lot to do until that. She mostly worked alone, sometimes with her favorite students, but she loved the old workhouse that her parents built. There was fabric all around and sketches. She embroidered a skirt when her phone rang. It was about 7 pm when Harry called her. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she shouted happily.</p><p>\u201cHi, darling. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks! You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, you know the Carpool Karaokes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.

That\u2019s why I called you. So you will surely see it\u201d He said. </p><p>\u201cThank you! I will watch it, uhm\u2026 like tomorrow\u201d she looked at her watch and counted the hours.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Of course, the time difference. What are you up to anyway?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on a skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I love working alone. It\u2019s peaceful and it\u2019s gonna be surely like I want it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Working in peace. All by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess in the near future you\u2019re gonna be working kind of alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t bring that up,\u201d he said with faked hurt in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Will you come back to the UK soon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you miss me?\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDuh, yes\u201d she smiled too. </p><p>\u201cI wanna go back to the UK but only to pick you up and go somewhere neither of us has been\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow! Harry Styles, you are a spontaneous man\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. I saw pictures of a red sand beach on Maui, Hawaii\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am. Do you wanna come?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean why not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll book tickets, you don\u2019t have to do anything just pack and I\u2019ll be there on Monday. We\u2019ll leave on Tuesday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d </p><p>With that, she agreed to go to Maui with Harry. It was so spontaneous. It took a few days for her to arrange everything for a two weeks leaves, but all of it was fine. Her aunt and uncle were happy that she goes out more. Harry arrived very early on Monday morning. </p><p>She was early in the workplace because she had to finish a shirt before leaving. It wasn\u2019t for the collection. It was for Harry. She designed and sew him a shirt. It wasn\u2019t regular, it was like a medieval prince\u2019s shirt. It was white with frilled stand collar and it was bishop sleeved. It was light and beautiful. She wrapped it in silk paper and put it in a box. She hurried back to her flat where Harry was already waiting by the door. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d She yelled at him and rushed into his arms. They hugged for long seconds. </p><p>\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d he said softly. </p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call you\u2019re here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived a minute ago. What\u2019s that box?\u201d He had childish curiosity on his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business \u2026yet\u201d she winked. As they went inside, Harry saw that she\u2019s already completely packed up. She was just waiting for him. </p><p>\u201cI have some things to do before we leave,\u201d Harry said as he placed himself on the couch. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Me too\u201d she shouted from the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be back when I\u2019ll pick you up to go to the airport,\u201d he said while playing with the hem of his t-shirt. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine\u201d she smiled as she walked in with a tray in her hands. They started drinking the tea.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I need to get my head clear,\u201d he said not looking at her. </p><p>\u201cI get it. You haven\u2019t stopped for years.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, and why not spend it with a beautiful girl?\u201d he smirked at his own comment. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flirt with me\u201d she stated. </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not buying it. Look, Harry you\u2019re gorgeous, in and out, but my life is complicated enough. We\u2019re already rumored. And even though it\u2019s fun, I don\u2019t want a romantic/physical relationship of any kind. I want you as a good friend because that\u2019s what my first instinct tells me to\u201d she was firm. She meant what she said. </p><p>\u201cNoted\u201d Harry shortly said and sipped his tea. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe too. I won\u2019t be flirting with you constantly. Only occasionally\u201d he smiled. Darcy rolled her eyes. </p><p>\u201cOh god! I\u2019m not even your type!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s my type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlonde, supermodel body, laugh on your bad jokes\u2026\u201d he rolled his eyes after the first two. </p><p>\u201cYou laugh on my bad jokes\u201d he exclaimed. </p><p>\u201cRemember when a week ago I hung up because you told a terrible joke?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was hurt for days\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut! That\u2019s not really my type for a long-term relationship. And I promise I\u2019ll be as friendly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because you\u2019re more like a brother to me, Harry,\u201d Darcy said softly. </p><p>\u201cOkay! You killed all the romance\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d she laughed. </p><p>Harry left after he finished his tea, he had some things to arrange before he leaves. She stayed in her flat looking at pictures of Hawaii and thinking about all the adventures they will go on. </p><p>What she said to Harry was true. She needed a family, a brother more than a boyfriend. And she knew that under the charmer there\u2019s a boy who needs a friend more like a girlfriend. Harry knew that too, but he wanted to try. Darcy was a beautiful girl after all.</p><p>She went into the workhouse for the last time to make sure everything goes well while she won\u2019t be there. Her right hand, Julieta was there. She asked her to be in charge in her absence. Julietta was an Italian girl, studying fashion design in London. The two girls were very different but their fashion taste was kind of the same. Darcy asked her to work with her as a student. Soon she was the best among the others and Julieta was in charge of a lot of things in the workhouse, she trained the new students. </p><p>Julietta didn\u2019t know about Harry, she didn\u2019t know that Darcy flies away to Hawaii with him. She only knew that she\u2019s going on holiday for two weeks. Only a few people knew about it. Except for the rumors after the AMAs, but Darcy soon confirmed among her friends that she does know Harry Styles, but they are not dating. They\u2019ve just met at an award show. That happens. You can just run into Harry Styles at a music award show. But not everyone became his friend\u2026</p><p>Harry arrived at 2 am. She was all packed already and haven\u2019t slept a bit because of the excitement. Harry helped with her bags and in ten minutes the door was closed and abandoned for two weeks. </p><p>They went to Heathrow and Harry said a friend will pick his car up, so he just left it in the parking lot. </p><p>When she started walking to the entrance Harry grabbed her hand. </p><p>\u201cI know a shorter way\u201d he smiled. Being Harry Styles gave him the privilege to skip lines and go in back entrances. They had a security check and then they waited in a private waiting area with a Starbucks and fancy restaurant and a luxury shop like a mini Harrods. </p><p>They had their handbags with them as they entered the plane\u2019s first class. He asked for privacy. </p><p>The flight was long and they had to change at JFK. It was tiring, but by skipping the long lines it was fun after all. At the very end of the flight, Darcy looked out of the window and gasped at the sight of the always sunny islands. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she said as she turned to Harry. </p><p>It took two hours to get out of the airport and get to the hotel you were staying. Harry checked in while you waited for him in the hall with the bags. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Come on! Let\u2019s see the room\u201d he said as he got back. </p><p>\u201cThe room? Do we share a room?\u201d she asked while grabbing her bag and going after Harry. </p><p>\u201cWhy? What did you think?\u201d he asked with a smirk. When he opened the door, she saw that there\u2019s only one bed in the room. A king size double bed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping on that with you\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard that sentence before\u201d she rolled her eyes on his words. \u201cKeep calm I\u2019m in the room next door.\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said. </p><p>\u201cBut the rooms can be opened,\u201d he said as he walked into her room and opened another door and went into his own.</p><p>\u201cMuch better\u201d she mumbled. </p><p>For a few minutes, she just walked around the hotel room. It was luxurious and beautiful. And the view from the balcony was incredible. They packed their stuff in the closets and around the rooms. The doors stayed open so they could hear each other.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is what we\u2019re gonna do,\u201d he said as he sat down next to her on the balcony. He held up a paper.</p><p>\u201cIs this a schedule?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but all of them are optional, but available for us\u201d he replied. </p><p>\u201cOkay. I think I really want to go to the beach first,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGreat option, third page: Beaches\u201d he was enthusiastic and she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cTonight, this beach?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSkinny dipping?\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m gonna throw you down from this balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy! It was a joke\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, and after that, we\u2019ll have dinner at the restaurant\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat idea\u201d she smiled. He left the room, but a few minutes later he came back with a towel resting on his arm and in tiny yellow swimming shorts, which caused Darcy to almost choke on her drink when she looked up. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the beach now. If you wanna come, I\u2019ll wait\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes. And get out!\u201d she said and pushed him back into his room. She closed the doors and took her swimsuit out of her closet along with a towel and flip-flops. She put on denim shorts too. They were ready to go and tried to find a place where there weren\u2019t too many people. Harry made himself a man-bun and tried to hide behind his sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you try to cover your face that much. That\u2019s the last thing right now that would make people recognize you\u201d she chuckled and looked at his tattooed body. \u201cYou\u2019 should\u2019ve put on a robe instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s an abandoned little bay there,\u201d he said ignoring the truth she just said. </p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s abandoned for a reason\u201d she mumbled. But they went there and hid behind bushes to lie down to sunbathe and get some rest. She stood up after ten minutes, looking for something to do. </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmhmh\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you..?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel it\u201d </p><p>They both went walking which was silent for a few minutes. </p><p>\u201cLook, Harry I gotta ask something, but I don\u2019t know how to say it nicely\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the rumors that you\u2019re dating Kendall Jenner\u201d she stayed silent to wait for an answer but Harry just chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is the question?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you two are really dating or you have something for her why are you with me on Hawaii for two weeks?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating officially with Kendall, but we might be something\u2026 I like you, you\u2019re my friend and I felt I need to get my head out of things and I didn\u2019t want anyone else besides me but you. Look, it might sound rude, but you barely know me, and it feels amazing. For all the years everyone I met knew more things about me than I did about myself. I\u2019m tired. I wanted to spend my time with someone I\u2019d really enjoy because we don\u2019t run the same circles again and again.\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d she said. She stopped and he did the same. She reached out and hugged him. It was a purely genuine interaction between them. When they parted she looked straight into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there when you break up\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d he said sarcastically, but they both laughed. When they got back to their spot, they went into the water and fooled around for an hour. They got out and stayed until the sun started setting. They watched the sunset sitting on the beach.</p><p>When they got back and prepared themselves for the dinner, Harry knocked on their shared door. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready, hun?\u201d he asked through the door. </p><p>\u201cJust a second\u201d she fixed her necklace for one last time. She opened the door and made him drop his jaws.</p><p>\u201cYou are incredibly beautiful, Darcy Adams\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh shut up\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>They went down to the luxurious restaurant and Harry got them a quiet table. Everything was so beautiful and they laughed a lot. When they finished the dinner she asked him to go to her room. She took the box out of the wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen this box before\u201d he exclaimed. </p><p>\u201cYes, you did. And it\u2019s actually yours\u201d she gave it to his hands. He smiled and his face lit up as a little boy\u2019s face. He carefully opened it. He tried to tell what it is, but he had to take it out fully.</p><p>\u201cOh my! This is beautiful\u201d he said. He observed the delicate fabric in his hands. </p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d she asked. </p><p>\u201cAre you joking? This is my favorite piece of clothes already.\u201d he smiled and pulled her into a hug. </p><p>\u201cI designed, sewed and decorated it myself,\u201d she told him. </p><p>\u201cYou are incredible\u201d he kissed her cheek. </p>",

Only occasionally&rdquo; he smiled. Darcy rolled her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh god! I&rsquo;m not even your type!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s my type?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blonde, supermodel body, laugh on your bad jokes&hellip;&rdquo; he rolled his eyes after the first two. </p><p>&ldquo;You laugh on my bad jokes&rdquo; he exclaimed. </p><p>&ldquo;Remember when a week ago I hung up because you told a terrible joke?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was hurt for days&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But! That&rsquo;s not really my type for a long-term relationship. And I promise I&rsquo;ll be as friendly as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, because you&rsquo;re more like a brother to me, Harry,&rdquo; Darcy said softly. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay! You killed all the romance&rdquo; he said. </p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; she laughed. </p><p>Harry left after he finished his tea, he had some things to arrange before he leaves. She stayed in her flat looking at pictures of Hawaii and thinking about all the adventures they will go on. </p><p>What she said to Harry was true. She needed a family, a brother more than a boyfriend. And she knew that under the charmer there&rsquo;s a boy who needs a friend more like a girlfriend. Harry knew that too, but he wanted to try. Darcy was a beautiful girl after all.</p><p>She went into the workhouse for the last time to make sure everything goes well while she won&rsquo;t be there. Her right hand, Julieta was there. She asked her to be in charge in her absence. Julietta was an Italian girl, studying fashion design in London. The two girls were very different but their fashion taste was kind of the same. Darcy asked her to work with her as a student. Soon she was the best among the others and Julieta was in charge of a lot of things in the workhouse, she trained the new students. </p><p>Julietta didn&rsquo;t know about Harry, she didn&rsquo;t know that Darcy flies away to Hawaii with him. She only knew that she&rsquo;s going on holiday for two weeks. Only a few people knew about it. Except for the rumors after the AMAs, but Darcy soon confirmed among her friends that she does know Harry Styles, but they are not dating. They&rsquo;ve just met at an award show. That happens. You can just run into Harry Styles at a music award show. But not everyone became his friend&hellip;</p><p>Harry arrived at 2 am. She was all packed already and haven&rsquo;t slept a bit because of the excitement. Harry helped with her bags and in ten minutes the door was closed and abandoned for two weeks. </p><p>They went to Heathrow and Harry said a friend will pick his car up, so he just left it in the parking lot. </p><p>When she started walking to the entrance Harry grabbed her hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I know a shorter way&rdquo; he smiled. Being Harry Styles gave him the privilege to skip lines and go in back entrances. They had a security check and then they waited in a private waiting area with a Starbucks and fancy restaurant and a luxury shop like a mini Harrods. </p><p>They had their handbags with them as they entered the plane&rsquo;s first class. He asked for privacy. </p><p>The flight was long and they had to change at JFK. It was tiring, but by skipping the long lines it was fun after all. At the very end of the flight, Darcy looked out of the window and gasped at the sight of the always sunny islands. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; she said as she turned to Harry. </p><p>It took two hours to get out of the airport and get to the hotel you were staying. Harry checked in while you waited for him in the hall with the bags. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. Come on! Let&rsquo;s see the room&rdquo; he said as he got back. </p><p>&ldquo;The room? Do we share a room?&rdquo; she asked while grabbing her bag and going after Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;Why? What did you think?&rdquo; he asked with a smirk. When he opened the door, she saw that there&rsquo;s only one bed in the room. A king size double bed. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sleeping on that with you&rdquo; she stated.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard that sentence before&rdquo; she rolled her eyes on his words. &ldquo;Keep calm I&rsquo;m in the room next door.&rdquo; he laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she said. </p><p>&ldquo;But the rooms can be opened,&rdquo; he said as he walked into her room and opened another door and went into his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Much better&rdquo; she mumbled. </p><p>For a few minutes, she just walked around the hotel room. It was luxurious and beautiful. And the view from the balcony was incredible. They packed their stuff in the closets and around the rooms. The doors stayed open so they could hear each other.</p><p>&ldquo;So, this is what we&rsquo;re gonna do,&rdquo; he said as he sat down next to her on the balcony. He held up a paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this a schedule?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but all of them are optional, but available for us&rdquo; he replied. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. I think I really want to go to the beach first,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Great option, third page: Beaches&rdquo; he was enthusiastic and she chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Tonight, this beach?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Skinny dipping?&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;m gonna throw you down from this balcony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Easy! It was a joke&rdquo; he laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t joking,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, and after that, we&rsquo;ll have dinner at the restaurant&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great idea&rdquo; she smiled. He left the room, but a few minutes later he came back with a towel resting on his arm and in tiny yellow swimming shorts, which caused Darcy to almost choke on her drink when she looked up. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the beach now. If you wanna come, I&rsquo;ll wait&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me five minutes. And get out!&rdquo; she said and pushed him back into his room. She closed the doors and took her swimsuit out of her closet along with a towel and flip-flops. She put on denim shorts too. They were ready to go and tried to find a place where there weren&rsquo;t too many people. Harry made himself a man-bun and tried to hide behind his sunglasses.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you try to cover your face that much. That&rsquo;s the last thing right now that would make people recognize you&rdquo; she chuckled and looked at his tattooed body. &ldquo;You&rsquo; should&rsquo;ve put on a robe instead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s an abandoned little bay there,&rdquo; he said ignoring the truth she just said. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s abandoned for a reason&rdquo; she mumbled. But they went there and hid behind bushes to lie down to sunbathe and get some rest. She stood up after ten minutes, looking for something to do. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hmhmh&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop staring at me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you..?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can feel it&rdquo; </p><p>They both went walking which was silent for a few minutes. </p><p>&ldquo;Look, Harry I gotta ask something, but I don&rsquo;t know how to say it nicely&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just say it&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw the rumors that you&rsquo;re dating Kendall Jenner&rdquo; she stayed silent to wait for an answer but Harry just chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;And what is the question?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;If you two are really dating or you have something for her why are you with me on Hawaii for two weeks?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dating officially with Kendall, but we might be something&hellip; I like you, you&rsquo;re my friend and I felt I need to get my head out of things and I didn&rsquo;t want anyone else besides me but you. Look, it might sound rude, but you barely know me, and it feels amazing. For all the years everyone I met knew more things about me than I did about myself. I&rsquo;m tired. I wanted to spend my time with someone I&rsquo;d really enjoy because we don&rsquo;t run the same circles again and again.&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; she said. She stopped and he did the same. She reached out and hugged him. It was a purely genuine interaction between them. When they parted she looked straight into his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be there when you break up&rdquo; she smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; he said sarcastically, but they both laughed. When they got back to their spot, they went into the water and fooled around for an hour. They got out and stayed until the sun started setting. They watched the sunset sitting on the beach.</p><p>When they got back and prepared themselves for the dinner, Harry knocked on their shared door. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready, hun?&rdquo; he asked through the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a second&rdquo; she fixed her necklace for one last time. She opened the door and made him drop his jaws.</p><p>&ldquo;You are incredibly beautiful, Darcy Adams&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut up&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I meant it&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;</p><p>They went down to the luxurious restaurant and Harry got them a quiet table. Everything was so beautiful and they laughed a lot. When they finished the dinner she asked him to go to her room. She took the box out of the wardrobe.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen this box before&rdquo; he exclaimed. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. And it&rsquo;s actually yours&rdquo; she gave it to his hands. He smiled and his face lit up as a little boy&rsquo;s face. He carefully opened it. He tried to tell what it is, but he had to take it out fully.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my! This is beautiful&rdquo; he said. He observed the delicate fabric in his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; she asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you joking? This is my favorite piece of clothes already.&rdquo; he smiled and pulled her into a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;I designed, sewed and decorated it myself,&rdquo; she told him. </p><p>&ldquo;You are incredible&rdquo; he kissed her cheek. </p>",
