You thought that maybe you should have given her up and she would have had a better life, because you just didn\u2019t seem to be doing anything right, as much as you tried. But through all of it, Jeongguk stayed by your side. Even though his busy\nschedule should have him sleep most of the day if he had free time, he spent the day with you and your daughter. He always\nmade sure that you were both alright and he never complained about anything.</p><p>Not\nonce.</p><p>And\nit was moments like these that it all came crashing down and you just couldn\u2019t keep it together anymore.</p><p>While\nhis daughter&rsquo;s eyes slowly dropped again and he sang her back to\nsleep, he reached out to you and gently caressed your cheek, wiping\naway the tears, but never stopping to sing.</p><p>And then he ended the song with a gentle: \u201c<i>And I still want you..</i>\u201d</p>",

You both\ntried your hardest, but every time something like this happened, you\njust wanted to cry, because you had no idea what was wrong with her and she obviously couldn\u2019t just tell you.</p><p>Despite\nall, you still loved her both with all your heart. That made it a bit easier.</p><p>Suddenly,\nJeongguk began humming one of their new songs, while his fingertips\nbrushed over her tiny nose, her forehead and her cheeks. And eventually he\nbegan singing.</p><p>It\nwas The Truth Untold, but a very, very soft version. He turned it into\na lullaby and the second your baby girl heard his voice, she calmed\ndown.</p><p><i>It\nwas like magic.</i></p><p>Her\nteary eyes were now big, staring up at her father and watching him sing\nline after line. And she wasn\u2019t the only one entranced. You were too.</p><p>And while your daughter stopped crying, you were the one that started,\neven though quietly. Because you were just so.. exhausted and stressed. You thought everything you were doing was wrong and you were a horrible mother. You thought that maybe you should have given her up and she would have had a better life, because you just didn\u2019t seem to be doing anything right, as much as you tried. But through all of it, Jeongguk stayed by your side. Even though his busy\nschedule should have him sleep most of the day if he had free time, he spent the day with you and your daughter. He always\nmade sure that you were both alright and he never complained about anything.</p><p>Not\nonce.</p><p>And\nit was moments like these that it all came crashing down and you just couldn\u2019t keep it together anymore.</p><p>While\nhis daughter\u2019s eyes slowly dropped again and he sang her back to\nsleep, he reached out to you and gently caressed your cheek, wiping\naway the tears, but never stopping to sing.</p><p>And then he ended the song with a gentle: \u201c<i>And I still want you..</i>\u201d</p>",

You thought that maybe you should have given her up and she would have had a better life, because you just didn&rsquo;t seem to be doing anything right, as much as you tried. But through all of it, Jeongguk stayed by your side. Even though his busy\nschedule should have him sleep most of the day if he had free time, he spent the day with you and your daughter.
