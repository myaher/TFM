There\u2019s a little vein on his neck, a blue, pulsing one. If Dan gets him really worked up, he can sometimes make it go purple.</p><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s it,\u201d Mr Richardson says, slamming his clipboard down over the graffiti. \u201cYou\u2019d best like it here, Mr Howell, because you\u2019ll be returning every day for the next two weeks.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSir, I have a job to get to after school,\u201d Dan protests, half-heartedly.</p><p>His job doesn\u2019t start until five, sometimes later, so actually he could probably still make it after detention and only be five minutes late. Louise would understand. But Mr Richardson\u2019s vein is approaching indigo.</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought of that before you rudely ignored whichever member of staff sent you here!\u201d</p><p>A girl Dan sees in here sometimes leans over from the next desk. Her wiry, dark hair brushes Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe was listening to music in German, Sir. Frau K caught him.\u201d</p><p>Mr Richardson\u2019s tight stance relaxes a little. \u201cThank you, Megan. That wasn\u2019t so difficult, was it Mr Howell?\u201d</p><p>Dan smirks. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I suppose you think whatever Goth-rock you blast into your eardrums is more important than language education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna go to Germany, Sir,\u201d Dan sighs. The words \u2018die fag\u2019 are carved into the surface of his desk. He thinks he might have written it there himself at some point, just to be ironic.</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point,\u201d Mr Richardson tells him. At this point, Dan tunes out. He nods along as Mr Richardson waffles on about procedure and rules and discipline and the future, and eventually, he moves on to the next poor soul. Megan aims him a secret eye-roll when he\u2019s not looking. Dan doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>*</p><p>The sound of Phil\u2019s warbling voice, singing above <i>Supermassive Black Hole</i>, is audible from the other end of the corridor. The school is pretty much deserted at this time, so he probably thinks nobody can hear him from the art studio. As he makes his way towards the racket, Dan can\u2019t help the smile twitching at his mouth.</p><p>Just then, another, louder, more boisterous set of voices ring out from around the corner. Dan thinks nothing of it, but then the owners of said voices come into view. He suppresses an eye roll, and then averts his gaze. Of course, it\u2019s no use. Hardy stops in his tracks, gaze zeroing in on Dan, alone. He holds up a hand to indicate that the three morons tracking along behind him should stop also.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Hardy calls out in his irritating posh-boy accent. \u201cHey, you. Hold it there. I want a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan replies, not stopping. \u201cThat\u2019s a word.\u201d</p><p>Predictably, Hardy reaches out and grabs his upper arm. Dan jerks away, practically growling, but Hardy\u2019s buddies surround him, preventing an escape.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should apply that smart attitude of yours to your school work, dunce,\u201d Hardy says, making his meathead buddies titter.</p><p>\u201cDunce,\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cWhat an archaic turn of phrase you have. Matches your Neanderthal gait.\u201d</p><p>Hardy surges forwards, as if to hit him, but one of his friends grabs him, holding him back. Dan swallows discreetly. That was close. Everyone knows Hardy has a short fuse and every teacher in the school in his back pocket. If Dan wants to get out of this situation with two non-blackened eyes, he needs to dial back the smartass stuff.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, Dean, I\u2019m cool,\u201d Hardy says, pulling free of Meathead No.1. \u201cListen, emo, I know you\u2019re bestest buds with that guy Lester.\u201d</p><p>Hardy waits, as if Dan will acknowledge this. He doesn\u2019t. Hardy grits his teeth. \u201cI need you to get a message to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet fucked,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Something animalistic flashes across Hardy\u2019s eyes, and he lunges, shoving Dan back into the lockers behind him. It hurts like a bitch, but Dan just glares. Hardy is up in his face, his friends dithering around him like nervous pigeons.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Hardy says through his clenched jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re the fag that works for my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a Sherlock Holmes on my hands,\u201d Dan growls.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t try to move, despite being pinned to the lockers. If he broke free of Hardy\u2019s grip, he\u2019d have four angry, beefed up morons to deal with, and he just can\u2019t be bothered.</p><p>Hardy sneers at him. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know the rumours about you, dipshit? About where you sneak off to after dark?\u201d</p><p>With everything he has, Dan fights to keep his face neutral. He doesn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cMy Dad has shares in the Ozone club,\u201d Hardy continues, sneer growing into a smug grin. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all the stories about you. How you throw yourself to your knees in the back rooms for every half-talented drummer that plays, every barman that has a spare twenty quid-\u201d</p><p>Dan kicks out, hard, catching Hardy in the shin. He roars in pain, clutching at it, and Dan breaks free. Meathead No. 2 catches him by the arm; Dan is just coming to terms with the idea that he\u2019s actually going to have to fight all of these dicks at once, and then a voice interrupts them.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here? Mr Howell, I thought I sent you home.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s Mr Richardson. Bizarrely, Dan feels a wash of pure relief at the sight of his bulging vein.</p><p>\u201cApologies, Sir,\u201d Hardy says at once. He\u2019s released his grip on his shin, and now has a shit-eating grin fixed in place of the furious expression he wore moments ago. \u201cNothing to worry about, we were just making sure Mr Howell here wasn\u2019t skipping out on detention.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Nothing good will come of Hardy learning his name.</p><p>Mr Richardson nods suspiciously, turning to Dan. \u201cIs that correct, Mr Howell?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods silently.</p><p>\u201cFine. But less commotion please. School might be over for the day, but while you\u2019re on the premises, you treat this place with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, Sir,\u201d Hardy says. \u201cWon\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Mr Richardson nods, then walks on, slowly, down the corridor.</p><p>Hardy waits until he gets a reasonable distance, and then turns back to Dan, jabbing a finger in his face. \u201cYou tell Lester that he needs to back the fuck off of my girlfriend, are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-girlfriend,\u201d Meathead No.1 corrects.</p><p>Hardy turns to him with a glare. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary misunderstanding. She\u2019s a nutcase. She\u2019s not going to throw our relationship away over some- some- art freak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like she already has,\u201d Dan says, trying not to appear too amused by Hardy\u2019s petulant attitude.</p><p>\u201cJust give him the fucking message, Howell,\u201d Hardy snarls. He darts another glance down the corridor, where Mr Richardson is still ambling away. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I own you.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help the snort of laughter that bursts out. \u201cCrawl out of your dad\u2019s asshole, Hardy. You own squat.\u201d</p><p>Hardy just grins. \u201cTry me, Howell.\u201d</p><p>He holds Dan\u2019s gaze for a moment, then spins away, stalking down the corridor. His friends follow hot on his heels. Dan watches them for a moment, then straightens his jacket, rolls his eyes and resumes his journey to the art studio. Phil\u2019s warbling hasn\u2019t stopped the entire time, which proves just how thick-headed those idiots truly are. They wanted to find Phil to relay this \u2018message\u2019, yet failed to realise he\u2019s through the door ten feet away.</p><p>Dan knocks on the closed studio door, but Phil is singing too loudly to hear, so he pushes it open. There\u2019s an enormous, human-sized canvas in front of Phil, on which he is painting a life-size portrait of Amanda, from her mahogany curls, right down to the pointed shoes on her miniature feet. The work looks painstaking; Dan has no idea how long Phil has been working on it, but he\u2019d guess days. Currently, he\u2019s on his knees, detailing Amanda\u2019s fingers on her right hand, singing along as he does so.</p><p>\u201cYou really captured her superficiality,\u201d Dan says, loud enough to be heard over the music.</p><p>Phil jumps slightly, then turns to Dan with a smile. \u201cYou like her?\u201d</p><p>Avoiding the question, Dan ambles over to the table where Phil\u2019s paints are scattered. \u201cYou sound like a dying cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d \u00a0He stands up and walks to the ancient boombox, spinning a dial to turn <i>Muse</i> down. \u201cWhat are you doing here, then? Thought you\u2019d already be at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Richardson owed me a spanking,\u201d Dan replies, picking up a paintbrush and swirling it in a glob of crimson.</p><p>\u201cYou got detention again? What for?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil sighs. There\u2019s an admonishment caught on his lip, but he doesn\u2019t verbalise it. Instead, he wanders over to lean on the desk beside Dan. \u201cDid I hear a scuffle outside? That wasn\u2019t you was it?\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cNot me.\u201d He gestures to the portrait in front of them. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this for? Entering the race for the Guinness World Record of creepiest stalker?\u201d</p><p>Phil nudges him in the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s she gonna do with it? Display it over her fireplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! People like getting pictures of themselves.\u201d</p><p>A hundred further teasing comments swirl around Dan\u2019s brain, but there\u2019s something about the tension in Phil\u2019s shoulders, something about the stripped back expression he wears that halts him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good, you know,\u201d Dan says instead. Phil\u2019s eyebrows travel a short way up his forehead. Dan clears his throat and hops down off the desk before he can reply. \u201cAnyway, just heard your caterwauling and thought I\u2019d see if I could put a stop to it. I\u2019m off to work.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, a faint smile on his lips. \u201cMind if I stop by later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Go home and leave me to do my job in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019ll come in about seven. You can stay at mine after if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Inside, the relief of this offer is overwhelming. Tonight is Ricky\u2019s night off, so he\u2019ll be home all evening. Dan wonders briefly if Phil might know this, but it seems unlikely. It\u2019s probably just a random offer. He waves vaguely at Phil, and heads for the door.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>He stops. Turns. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for saying it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Awkwardly, Dan holds his gaze for a moment. \u201cYeah. No worries.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s nine fifty-three and Phil still isn\u2019t at the cafe. Dan has to close at ten \u2013 should already be closing up, in fact \u2013 but Phil said he\u2019d be here. So he waits until the last second. He begins the closing routine slowly, rinsing out the coffee machine piece by piece, taking out the tray and scrubbing it in the kitchen sink, then the grill, then the grinder too. He sweeps and mops the floor, flips the \u2018open\u2019 sign to \u2018sorry, we\u2019re closed\u2019, but keeps the door unlocked just in case. It gets to ten-thirty, and Dan runs out of tasks to do. He needs to leave.</p><p>The nicotine craving burns at his stomach as he locks the door. The local off-licence will be closed now, but if he goes to Ozone, he might be able to snag one off Ben or someone. Maybe he could even wrangle a whole pack. He grimaces at the thought of what he might have to do for a cigarette fix, but swallows down his reservations. Anything is better than going home and facing an angry, likely drunk Ricky.</p><p>He pulls his hood up and heads for the bus stop, eyes down. He has just enough change in his pocket for the bus, though it\u2019s mostly in pennies, so the driver isn\u2019t pleased. Dan just avoids his eye, finds a seat near the back and plugs himself into his music. It\u2019s not far to Ozone, maybe fifteen minutes. Halfway through the journey, his phone buzzes.</p><p><b>From: Phil<br/>To: Dan<br/>10:44pm</b><br/>hey!!! Sorry I didn\u2019t make it<br/>to the cafe \u2013 I drove past Amanda<br/>at the fountain in town so I risked<br/>it and stopped to chat :o her mates<br/>left her without a way to get home<br/>so we got a coffee and I drove her<br/>back. Been debriefing with mum lol<br/>I forgot all about coming to see u!<br/>Still welcome to come over if u<br/>want! Im just chilling at home but<br/>gonna go to bed soon. Up to you!<br/>hope work wasn\u2019t too killer :P<br/>xx</p><p>Dan skims the message once, then pockets the phone without replying. His heart aches in an annoying way. All he can see is Phil and Amanda, sipping Costa coffee perched on the lip of the fountain in the town square. In some kind of cruelly ironic cinematic moment, the bus glides past this very fountain. Dan turns his face from the window.</p><p>Eventually, his stop comes up, and Dan all but runs the rest of the way. Ozone is the town\u2019s only club, and it\u2019s really more of a large bar. There\u2019s a dancefloor, sort of, and a stage, but mostly it\u2019s high tables with bar stools and hundreds of vaguely menacing drunk people, utilising the one decent place that stays open late every day. Dan slips in with a loaded glance at Ben on the door. It takes him less than five minutes to zero in on the poor sucker he\u2019ll be getting to buy him drinks tonight, and even less time to sidle up, flash a sultry smile, and ask the dude for a JD and coke, no ice.</p><p>\u201cCheeky shit,\u201d the guy says, but turns around and orders it anyway. He\u2019s tall and broad, alone with only his pint. Dan learns his name, then forgets it in the next moment. The dude doesn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cYou got any fags?\u201d Dan asks after he\u2019s listened to whatever dull shite the guy is saying for as long as he can stand. \u201cI\u2019m <i>desperate</i>.\u201d</p><p>He loads the last word, hating himself.</p><p>The guy grins, exposing a graveyard of yellowing teeth, stained from nicotine and dark beer. \u201cYeah?\u201d His fingers are scratching underneath the hem of Dan\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019ll I get in return?\u201d</p><p>Dan says nothing, just holds his gaze, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a pack of Djarums,\u201d the dude says, patting his jacket pocket. \u201cWere meant for my missus, but I could be persuaded otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre Djarums the cherry ones?\u201d Dan asks, wrinkling his nose. He\u2019s already scanning the crowd discreetly, looking for another person he could ask.</p><p>\u201cYou want \u2018em or not, princess?\u201d</p><p>Dan hesitates. The guy smells like a brewery, and his hair is thinning. Not to mention, there\u2019s a dull gold ring on his finger. But Dan hasn\u2019t had a smoke in over 24 hours, and there\u2019s no point in pretending he\u2019s about to go home. Phil is asleep by now, probably.</p><p>He smiles, holding out his hand. \u201cI want them.\u201d</p><p>The guy takes it, downs the dregs of his pint, and follows Dan through the scattered, glassy-eyed people, into the back.</p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s 3am, but Phil lets him in anyway. He\u2019s rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and his hair is sticking up, but he doesn\u2019t even ask why Dan is on his doorstep. To avoid waking everyone up, Dan had texted Phil that he was outside. He has no idea how Phil woke up to receive it.</p><p>Dan silently follows Phil up the stairs, waits patiently on the edge of his bed as Phil finds him a big t-shirt and pyjama bottoms. He changes while Phil is out of the room. When he returns, he has a glass of water in his hand, which he hands to Dan.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Phil asks, then crawls into the indent he\u2019s already left in the mattress.</p><p>Dan places the water down on Phil\u2019s bedside table, and slips in beside him. He keeps a few inches between his own limbs and Phil\u2019s at first, but inevitably Phil closes the gap. He\u2019s always been a fidgety sleeper. Dan wonders if that\u2019s the sort of thing best friends are supposed to know about each other.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like cherries,\u201d Phil mutters. He lays his fingers on Dan\u2019s arm.</p><p>There\u2019s a tight, sharp scratching at the back of Dan\u2019s throat. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s from the cigarettes. \u201cYeah. Is it gross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says at once. He takes a deep, long breath in. \u201cSmells nice.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that guy from the bar will give him another pack. Maybe, if Dan\u2019s extra nice, and can smile just sweetly enough, he\u2019ll never have to smoke anything but Djarums, and he\u2019ll smell just like this forever, and Phil\u2019s smile will look just like this, like it does right now, every time he breathes it in.</p>",

That is, until Phil starts talking about Amanda Jones.<br></i><b>Word Count:</b> WIP (Estimated 12-15 chapters) updates every Tuesday<br><b>Rating:</b> Explicit<br><b>Warnings:</b> Smoking, swearing, implied prostitution, broken home, class divide/classism, pining, light homophobia, sex <br></b></p><p><b>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177738852529/some-kind-of-folliful-new-fic\">Chapter One</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/177982263491/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Two</a>]<br>[<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/178227297225/some-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter\">Chapter Three</a>]<br></b><b>[<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15894954%2Fchapters%2F37042212%23workskin&amp;t=ZmViYTJkOTIyM2U2N2Q0NGY1OTg0MjM0NTRmYTUzYzI4OWU4MmI1YSw3QVQzUzV3aQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F178242287465%2Fsome-kind-of-folliful-new-chapter&amp;m=1\">Ao3</a>]</b></p><p>\u201cWhat are you in detention for, Mister Howell?\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>Dan drags his eyes from the graffiti-caked desk to meet Mr Richardson\u2019s disapproving stare. \u201cSir, I honestly can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Mr Richardson does not look pleased. \u201cHand me your report card.\u201d</p><p>Dan makes a show of looking around himself, patting down his jacket and jeans pockets, then comes back with a shrug. \u201cGuess I forgot it.\u201d</p><p>The smug grin is probably a little overkill, but Dan really hates Mr Richardson. There\u2019s a little vein on his neck, a blue, pulsing one. If Dan gets him really worked up, he can sometimes make it go purple.</p><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s it,\u201d Mr Richardson says, slamming his clipboard down over the graffiti. \u201cYou\u2019d best like it here, Mr Howell, because you\u2019ll be returning every day for the next two weeks.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSir, I have a job to get to after school,\u201d Dan protests, half-heartedly.</p><p>His job doesn\u2019t start until five, sometimes later, so actually he could probably still make it after detention and only be five minutes late. Louise would understand. But Mr Richardson\u2019s vein is approaching indigo.</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought of that before you rudely ignored whichever member of staff sent you here!\u201d</p><p>A girl Dan sees in here sometimes leans over from the next desk. Her wiry, dark hair brushes Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe was listening to music in German, Sir. Frau K caught him.\u201d</p><p>Mr Richardson\u2019s tight stance relaxes a little. \u201cThank you, Megan. That wasn\u2019t so difficult, was it Mr Howell?\u201d</p><p>Dan smirks. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I suppose you think whatever Goth-rock you blast into your eardrums is more important than language education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna go to Germany, Sir,\u201d Dan sighs. The words \u2018die fag\u2019 are carved into the surface of his desk. He thinks he might have written it there himself at some point, just to be ironic.</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point,\u201d Mr Richardson tells him. At this point, Dan tunes out. He nods along as Mr Richardson waffles on about procedure and rules and discipline and the future, and eventually, he moves on to the next poor soul. Megan aims him a secret eye-roll when he\u2019s not looking. Dan doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>*</p><p>The sound of Phil\u2019s warbling voice, singing above <i>Supermassive Black Hole</i>, is audible from the other end of the corridor. The school is pretty much deserted at this time, so he probably thinks nobody can hear him from the art studio. As he makes his way towards the racket, Dan can\u2019t help the smile twitching at his mouth.</p><p>Just then, another, louder, more boisterous set of voices ring out from around the corner. Dan thinks nothing of it, but then the owners of said voices come into view. He suppresses an eye roll, and then averts his gaze. Of course, it\u2019s no use. Hardy stops in his tracks, gaze zeroing in on Dan, alone. He holds up a hand to indicate that the three morons tracking along behind him should stop also.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Hardy calls out in his irritating posh-boy accent. \u201cHey, you. Hold it there. I want a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan replies, not stopping. \u201cThat\u2019s a word.\u201d</p><p>Predictably, Hardy reaches out and grabs his upper arm. Dan jerks away, practically growling, but Hardy\u2019s buddies surround him, preventing an escape.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should apply that smart attitude of yours to your school work, dunce,\u201d Hardy says, making his meathead buddies titter.</p><p>\u201cDunce,\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cWhat an archaic turn of phrase you have. Matches your Neanderthal gait.\u201d</p><p>Hardy surges forwards, as if to hit him, but one of his friends grabs him, holding him back. Dan swallows discreetly. That was close. Everyone knows Hardy has a short fuse and every teacher in the school in his back pocket. If Dan wants to get out of this situation with two non-blackened eyes, he needs to dial back the smartass stuff.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, Dean, I\u2019m cool,\u201d Hardy says, pulling free of Meathead No.1. \u201cListen, emo, I know you\u2019re bestest buds with that guy Lester.\u201d</p><p>Hardy waits, as if Dan will acknowledge this. He doesn\u2019t. Hardy grits his teeth. \u201cI need you to get a message to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet fucked,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Something animalistic flashes across Hardy\u2019s eyes, and he lunges, shoving Dan back into the lockers behind him. It hurts like a bitch, but Dan just glares. Hardy is up in his face, his friends dithering around him like nervous pigeons.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Hardy says through his clenched jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re the fag that works for my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a Sherlock Holmes on my hands,\u201d Dan growls.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t try to move, despite being pinned to the lockers. If he broke free of Hardy\u2019s grip, he\u2019d have four angry, beefed up morons to deal with, and he just can\u2019t be bothered.</p><p>Hardy sneers at him. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know the rumours about you, dipshit? About where you sneak off to after dark?\u201d</p><p>With everything he has, Dan fights to keep his face neutral. He doesn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cMy Dad has shares in the Ozone club,\u201d Hardy continues, sneer growing into a smug grin. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all the stories about you. How you throw yourself to your knees in the back rooms for every half-talented drummer that plays, every barman that has a spare twenty quid-\u201d</p><p>Dan kicks out, hard, catching Hardy in the shin. He roars in pain, clutching at it, and Dan breaks free. Meathead No. 2 catches him by the arm; Dan is just coming to terms with the idea that he\u2019s actually going to have to fight all of these dicks at once, and then a voice interrupts them.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here? Mr Howell, I thought I sent you home.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s Mr Richardson. Bizarrely, Dan feels a wash of pure relief at the sight of his bulging vein.</p><p>\u201cApologies, Sir,\u201d Hardy says at once. He\u2019s released his grip on his shin, and now has a shit-eating grin fixed in place of the furious expression he wore moments ago. \u201cNothing to worry about, we were just making sure Mr Howell here wasn\u2019t skipping out on detention.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Nothing good will come of Hardy learning his name.</p><p>Mr Richardson nods suspiciously, turning to Dan. \u201cIs that correct, Mr Howell?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods silently.</p><p>\u201cFine. But less commotion please. School might be over for the day, but while you\u2019re on the premises, you treat this place with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, Sir,\u201d Hardy says. \u201cWon\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Mr Richardson nods, then walks on, slowly, down the corridor.</p><p>Hardy waits until he gets a reasonable distance, and then turns back to Dan, jabbing a finger in his face. \u201cYou tell Lester that he needs to back the fuck off of my girlfriend, are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-girlfriend,\u201d Meathead No.1 corrects.</p><p>Hardy turns to him with a glare. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary misunderstanding. She\u2019s a nutcase. She\u2019s not going to throw our relationship away over some- some- art freak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like she already has,\u201d Dan says, trying not to appear too amused by Hardy\u2019s petulant attitude.</p><p>\u201cJust give him the fucking message, Howell,\u201d Hardy snarls. He darts another glance down the corridor, where Mr Richardson is still ambling away. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I own you.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help the snort of laughter that bursts out. \u201cCrawl out of your dad\u2019s asshole, Hardy. You own squat.\u201d</p><p>Hardy just grins. \u201cTry me, Howell.\u201d</p><p>He holds Dan\u2019s gaze for a moment, then spins away, stalking down the corridor. His friends follow hot on his heels. Dan watches them for a moment, then straightens his jacket, rolls his eyes and resumes his journey to the art studio. Phil\u2019s warbling hasn\u2019t stopped the entire time, which proves just how thick-headed those idiots truly are. They wanted to find Phil to relay this \u2018message\u2019, yet failed to realise he\u2019s through the door ten feet away.</p><p>Dan knocks on the closed studio door, but Phil is singing too loudly to hear, so he pushes it open. There\u2019s an enormous, human-sized canvas in front of Phil, on which he is painting a life-size portrait of Amanda, from her mahogany curls, right down to the pointed shoes on her miniature feet. The work looks painstaking; Dan has no idea how long Phil has been working on it, but he\u2019d guess days. Currently, he\u2019s on his knees, detailing Amanda\u2019s fingers on her right hand, singing along as he does so.</p><p>\u201cYou really captured her superficiality,\u201d Dan says, loud enough to be heard over the music.</p><p>Phil jumps slightly, then turns to Dan with a smile. \u201cYou like her?\u201d</p><p>Avoiding the question, Dan ambles over to the table where Phil\u2019s paints are scattered. \u201cYou sound like a dying cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d \u00a0He stands up and walks to the ancient boombox, spinning a dial to turn <i>Muse</i> down. \u201cWhat are you doing here, then? Thought you\u2019d already be at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Richardson owed me a spanking,\u201d Dan replies, picking up a paintbrush and swirling it in a glob of crimson.</p><p>\u201cYou got detention again? What for?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil sighs. There\u2019s an admonishment caught on his lip, but he doesn\u2019t verbalise it. Instead, he wanders over to lean on the desk beside Dan. \u201cDid I hear a scuffle outside? That wasn\u2019t you was it?\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cNot me.\u201d He gestures to the portrait in front of them. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this for? Entering the race for the Guinness World Record of creepiest stalker?\u201d</p><p>Phil nudges him in the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s she gonna do with it? Display it over her fireplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! People like getting pictures of themselves.\u201d</p><p>A hundred further teasing comments swirl around Dan\u2019s brain, but there\u2019s something about the tension in Phil\u2019s shoulders, something about the stripped back expression he wears that halts him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good, you know,\u201d Dan says instead. Phil\u2019s eyebrows travel a short way up his forehead. Dan clears his throat and hops down off the desk before he can reply. \u201cAnyway, just heard your caterwauling and thought I\u2019d see if I could put a stop to it. I\u2019m off to work.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, a faint smile on his lips. \u201cMind if I stop by later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Go home and leave me to do my job in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019ll come in about seven. You can stay at mine after if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Inside, the relief of this offer is overwhelming. Tonight is Ricky\u2019s night off, so he\u2019ll be home all evening. Dan wonders briefly if Phil might know this, but it seems unlikely. It\u2019s probably just a random offer. He waves vaguely at Phil, and heads for the door.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>He stops. Turns. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for saying it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Awkwardly, Dan holds his gaze for a moment. \u201cYeah. No worries.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s nine fifty-three and Phil still isn\u2019t at the cafe. Dan has to close at ten \u2013 should already be closing up, in fact \u2013 but Phil said he\u2019d be here. So he waits until the last second. He begins the closing routine slowly, rinsing out the coffee machine piece by piece, taking out the tray and scrubbing it in the kitchen sink, then the grill, then the grinder too. He sweeps and mops the floor, flips the \u2018open\u2019 sign to \u2018sorry, we\u2019re closed\u2019, but keeps the door unlocked just in case. It gets to ten-thirty, and Dan runs out of tasks to do. He needs to leave.</p><p>The nicotine craving burns at his stomach as he locks the door. The local off-licence will be closed now, but if he goes to Ozone, he might be able to snag one off Ben or someone. Maybe he could even wrangle a whole pack. He grimaces at the thought of what he might have to do for a cigarette fix, but swallows down his reservations. Anything is better than going home and facing an angry, likely drunk Ricky.</p><p>He pulls his hood up and heads for the bus stop, eyes down. He has just enough change in his pocket for the bus, though it\u2019s mostly in pennies, so the driver isn\u2019t pleased. Dan just avoids his eye, finds a seat near the back and plugs himself into his music. It\u2019s not far to Ozone, maybe fifteen minutes. Halfway through the journey, his phone buzzes.</p><p><b>From: Phil<br>To: Dan<br>10:44pm</b><br>hey!!! Sorry I didn\u2019t make it<br>to the cafe \u2013 I drove past Amanda<br>at the fountain in town so I risked<br>it and stopped to chat :o her mates<br>left her without a way to get home<br>so we got a coffee and I drove her<br>back. Been debriefing with mum lol<br>I forgot all about coming to see u!<br>Still welcome to come over if u<br>want! Im just chilling at home but<br>gonna go to bed soon. Up to you!<br>hope work wasn\u2019t too killer :P<br>xx</p><p>Dan skims the message once, then pockets the phone without replying. His heart aches in an annoying way. All he can see is Phil and Amanda, sipping Costa coffee perched on the lip of the fountain in the town square. In some kind of cruelly ironic cinematic moment, the bus glides past this very fountain. Dan turns his face from the window.</p><p>Eventually, his stop comes up, and Dan all but runs the rest of the way. Ozone is the town\u2019s only club, and it\u2019s really more of a large bar. There\u2019s a dancefloor, sort of, and a stage, but mostly it\u2019s high tables with bar stools and hundreds of vaguely menacing drunk people, utilising the one decent place that stays open late every day. Dan slips in with a loaded glance at Ben on the door. It takes him less than five minutes to zero in on the poor sucker he\u2019ll be getting to buy him drinks tonight, and even less time to sidle up, flash a sultry smile, and ask the dude for a JD and coke, no ice.</p><p>\u201cCheeky shit,\u201d the guy says, but turns around and orders it anyway. He\u2019s tall and broad, alone with only his pint. Dan learns his name, then forgets it in the next moment. The dude doesn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cYou got any fags?\u201d Dan asks after he\u2019s listened to whatever dull shite the guy is saying for as long as he can stand. \u201cI\u2019m <i>desperate</i>.\u201d</p><p>He loads the last word, hating himself.</p><p>The guy grins, exposing a graveyard of yellowing teeth, stained from nicotine and dark beer. \u201cYeah?\u201d His fingers are scratching underneath the hem of Dan\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019ll I get in return?\u201d</p><p>Dan says nothing, just holds his gaze, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a pack of Djarums,\u201d the dude says, patting his jacket pocket. \u201cWere meant for my missus, but I could be persuaded otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre Djarums the cherry ones?\u201d Dan asks, wrinkling his nose. He\u2019s already scanning the crowd discreetly, looking for another person he could ask.</p><p>\u201cYou want \u2018em or not, princess?\u201d</p><p>Dan hesitates. The guy smells like a brewery, and his hair is thinning. Not to mention, there\u2019s a dull gold ring on his finger. But Dan hasn\u2019t had a smoke in over 24 hours, and there\u2019s no point in pretending he\u2019s about to go home. Phil is asleep by now, probably.</p><p>He smiles, holding out his hand. \u201cI want them.\u201d</p><p>The guy takes it, downs the dregs of his pint, and follows Dan through the scattered, glassy-eyed people, into the back.</p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s 3am, but Phil lets him in anyway. He\u2019s rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and his hair is sticking up, but he doesn\u2019t even ask why Dan is on his doorstep. To avoid waking everyone up, Dan had texted Phil that he was outside. He has no idea how Phil woke up to receive it.</p><p>Dan silently follows Phil up the stairs, waits patiently on the edge of his bed as Phil finds him a big t-shirt and pyjama bottoms. He changes while Phil is out of the room. When he returns, he has a glass of water in his hand, which he hands to Dan.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Phil asks, then crawls into the indent he\u2019s already left in the mattress.</p><p>Dan places the water down on Phil\u2019s bedside table, and slips in beside him. He keeps a few inches between his own limbs and Phil\u2019s at first, but inevitably Phil closes the gap. He\u2019s always been a fidgety sleeper. Dan wonders if that\u2019s the sort of thing best friends are supposed to know about each other.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like cherries,\u201d Phil mutters. He lays his fingers on Dan\u2019s arm.</p><p>There\u2019s a tight, sharp scratching at the back of Dan\u2019s throat. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s from the cigarettes. \u201cYeah. Is it gross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says at once. He takes a deep, long breath in. \u201cSmells nice.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that guy from the bar will give him another pack. Maybe, if Dan\u2019s extra nice, and can smile just sweetly enough, he\u2019ll never have to smoke anything but Djarums, and he\u2019ll smell just like this forever, and Phil\u2019s smile will look just like this, like it does right now, every time he breathes it in.</p>",

Phil is loud, excitable, and irritatingly happy all of the time. He seems to find Dan\u2019s perpetual attitude funny, and despite Dan\u2019s best efforts to shun him and everyone else, wants to be around him all the time.

There\u2019s a little vein on his neck, a blue, pulsing one. If Dan gets him really worked up, he can sometimes make it go purple.</p><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s it,\u201d Mr Richardson says, slamming his clipboard down over the graffiti. \u201cYou\u2019d best like it here, Mr Howell, because you\u2019ll be returning every day for the next two weeks.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSir, I have a job to get to after school,\u201d Dan protests, half-heartedly.</p><p>His job doesn\u2019t start until five, sometimes later, so actually he could probably still make it after detention and only be five minutes late. Louise would understand. But Mr Richardson\u2019s vein is approaching indigo.</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought of that before you rudely ignored whichever member of staff sent you here!\u201d</p><p>A girl Dan sees in here sometimes leans over from the next desk. Her wiry, dark hair brushes Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe was listening to music in German, Sir. Frau K caught him.\u201d</p><p>Mr Richardson\u2019s tight stance relaxes a little. \u201cThank you, Megan. That wasn\u2019t so difficult, was it Mr Howell?\u201d</p><p>Dan smirks. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I suppose you think whatever Goth-rock you blast into your eardrums is more important than language education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna go to Germany, Sir,\u201d Dan sighs. The words \u2018die fag\u2019 are carved into the surface of his desk. He thinks he might have written it there himself at some point, just to be ironic.</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point,\u201d Mr Richardson tells him. At this point, Dan tunes out. He nods along as Mr Richardson waffles on about procedure and rules and discipline and the future, and eventually, he moves on to the next poor soul. Megan aims him a secret eye-roll when he\u2019s not looking. Dan doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>*</p><p>The sound of Phil\u2019s warbling voice, singing above <i>Supermassive Black Hole</i>, is audible from the other end of the corridor. The school is pretty much deserted at this time, so he probably thinks nobody can hear him from the art studio. As he makes his way towards the racket, Dan can\u2019t help the smile twitching at his mouth.</p><p>Just then, another, louder, more boisterous set of voices ring out from around the corner. Dan thinks nothing of it, but then the owners of said voices come into view. He suppresses an eye roll, and then averts his gaze. Of course, it\u2019s no use. Hardy stops in his tracks, gaze zeroing in on Dan, alone. He holds up a hand to indicate that the three morons tracking along behind him should stop also.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Hardy calls out in his irritating posh-boy accent. \u201cHey, you. Hold it there. I want a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan replies, not stopping. \u201cThat\u2019s a word.\u201d</p><p>Predictably, Hardy reaches out and grabs his upper arm. Dan jerks away, practically growling, but Hardy\u2019s buddies surround him, preventing an escape.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should apply that smart attitude of yours to your school work, dunce,\u201d Hardy says, making his meathead buddies titter.</p><p>\u201cDunce,\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cWhat an archaic turn of phrase you have. Matches your Neanderthal gait.\u201d</p><p>Hardy surges forwards, as if to hit him, but one of his friends grabs him, holding him back. Dan swallows discreetly. That was close. Everyone knows Hardy has a short fuse and every teacher in the school in his back pocket. If Dan wants to get out of this situation with two non-blackened eyes, he needs to dial back the smartass stuff.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, Dean, I\u2019m cool,\u201d Hardy says, pulling free of Meathead No.1. \u201cListen, emo, I know you\u2019re bestest buds with that guy Lester.\u201d</p><p>Hardy waits, as if Dan will acknowledge this. He doesn\u2019t. Hardy grits his teeth. \u201cI need you to get a message to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet fucked,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Something animalistic flashes across Hardy\u2019s eyes, and he lunges, shoving Dan back into the lockers behind him. It hurts like a bitch, but Dan just glares. Hardy is up in his face, his friends dithering around him like nervous pigeons.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Hardy says through his clenched jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re the fag that works for my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a Sherlock Holmes on my hands,\u201d Dan growls.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t try to move, despite being pinned to the lockers. If he broke free of Hardy\u2019s grip, he\u2019d have four angry, beefed up morons to deal with, and he just can\u2019t be bothered.</p><p>Hardy sneers at him. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know the rumours about you, dipshit? About where you sneak off to after dark?\u201d</p><p>With everything he has, Dan fights to keep his face neutral. He doesn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cMy Dad has shares in the Ozone club,\u201d Hardy continues, sneer growing into a smug grin. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all the stories about you. How you throw yourself to your knees in the back rooms for every half-talented drummer that plays, every barman that has a spare twenty quid-\u201d</p><p>Dan kicks out, hard, catching Hardy in the shin. He roars in pain, clutching at it, and Dan breaks free. Meathead No. 2 catches him by the arm; Dan is just coming to terms with the idea that he\u2019s actually going to have to fight all of these dicks at once, and then a voice interrupts them.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here? Mr Howell, I thought I sent you home.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s Mr Richardson. Bizarrely, Dan feels a wash of pure relief at the sight of his bulging vein.</p><p>\u201cApologies, Sir,\u201d Hardy says at once. He\u2019s released his grip on his shin, and now has a shit-eating grin fixed in place of the furious expression he wore moments ago. \u201cNothing to worry about, we were just making sure Mr Howell here wasn\u2019t skipping out on detention.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Nothing good will come of Hardy learning his name.</p><p>Mr Richardson nods suspiciously, turning to Dan. \u201cIs that correct, Mr Howell?\u201d</p><p>Dan nods silently.</p><p>\u201cFine. But less commotion please. School might be over for the day, but while you\u2019re on the premises, you treat this place with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, Sir,\u201d Hardy says. \u201cWon\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Mr Richardson nods, then walks on, slowly, down the corridor.</p><p>Hardy waits until he gets a reasonable distance, and then turns back to Dan, jabbing a finger in his face. \u201cYou tell Lester that he needs to back the fuck off of my girlfriend, are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-girlfriend,\u201d Meathead No.1 corrects.</p><p>Hardy turns to him with a glare. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary misunderstanding. She\u2019s a nutcase. She\u2019s not going to throw our relationship away over some- some- art freak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like she already has,\u201d Dan says, trying not to appear too amused by Hardy\u2019s petulant attitude.</p><p>\u201cJust give him the fucking message, Howell,\u201d Hardy snarls. He darts another glance down the corridor, where Mr Richardson is still ambling away. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I own you.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help the snort of laughter that bursts out. \u201cCrawl out of your dad\u2019s asshole, Hardy. You own squat.\u201d</p><p>Hardy just grins. \u201cTry me, Howell.\u201d</p><p>He holds Dan\u2019s gaze for a moment, then spins away, stalking down the corridor. His friends follow hot on his heels. Dan watches them for a moment, then straightens his jacket, rolls his eyes and resumes his journey to the art studio. Phil\u2019s warbling hasn\u2019t stopped the entire time, which proves just how thick-headed those idiots truly are. They wanted to find Phil to relay this \u2018message\u2019, yet failed to realise he\u2019s through the door ten feet away.</p><p>Dan knocks on the closed studio door, but Phil is singing too loudly to hear, so he pushes it open. There\u2019s an enormous, human-sized canvas in front of Phil, on which he is painting a life-size portrait of Amanda, from her mahogany curls, right down to the pointed shoes on her miniature feet. The work looks painstaking; Dan has no idea how long Phil has been working on it, but he\u2019d guess days. Currently, he\u2019s on his knees, detailing Amanda\u2019s fingers on her right hand, singing along as he does so.</p><p>\u201cYou really captured her superficiality,\u201d Dan says, loud enough to be heard over the music.</p><p>Phil jumps slightly, then turns to Dan with a smile. \u201cYou like her?\u201d</p><p>Avoiding the question, Dan ambles over to the table where Phil\u2019s paints are scattered. \u201cYou sound like a dying cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d \u00a0He stands up and walks to the ancient boombox, spinning a dial to turn <i>Muse</i> down. \u201cWhat are you doing here, then? Thought you\u2019d already be at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Richardson owed me a spanking,\u201d Dan replies, picking up a paintbrush and swirling it in a glob of crimson.</p><p>\u201cYou got detention again? What for?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugs. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil sighs. There\u2019s an admonishment caught on his lip, but he doesn\u2019t verbalise it. Instead, he wanders over to lean on the desk beside Dan. \u201cDid I hear a scuffle outside? That wasn\u2019t you was it?\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cNot me.\u201d He gestures to the portrait in front of them. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this for? Entering the race for the Guinness World Record of creepiest stalker?\u201d</p><p>Phil nudges him in the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s she gonna do with it? Display it over her fireplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! People like getting pictures of themselves.\u201d</p><p>A hundred further teasing comments swirl around Dan\u2019s brain, but there\u2019s something about the tension in Phil\u2019s shoulders, something about the stripped back expression he wears that halts him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good, you know,\u201d Dan says instead. Phil\u2019s eyebrows travel a short way up his forehead. Dan clears his throat and hops down off the desk before he can reply. \u201cAnyway, just heard your caterwauling and thought I\u2019d see if I could put a stop to it. I\u2019m off to work.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods, a faint smile on his lips. \u201cMind if I stop by later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Go home and leave me to do my job in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019ll come in about seven. You can stay at mine after if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Dan says.</p><p>Inside, the relief of this offer is overwhelming. Tonight is Ricky\u2019s night off, so he\u2019ll be home all evening. Dan wonders briefly if Phil might know this, but it seems unlikely. It\u2019s probably just a random offer. He waves vaguely at Phil, and heads for the door.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>He stops. Turns. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for saying it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Awkwardly, Dan holds his gaze for a moment. \u201cYeah. No worries.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s nine fifty-three and Phil still isn\u2019t at the cafe. Dan has to close at ten \u2013 should already be closing up, in fact \u2013 but Phil said he\u2019d be here. So he waits until the last second. He begins the closing routine slowly, rinsing out the coffee machine piece by piece, taking out the tray and scrubbing it in the kitchen sink, then the grill, then the grinder too. He sweeps and mops the floor, flips the \u2018open\u2019 sign to \u2018sorry, we\u2019re closed\u2019, but keeps the door unlocked just in case. It gets to ten-thirty, and Dan runs out of tasks to do. He needs to leave.</p><p>The nicotine craving burns at his stomach as he locks the door. The local off-licence will be closed now, but if he goes to Ozone, he might be able to snag one off Ben or someone. Maybe he could even wrangle a whole pack. He grimaces at the thought of what he might have to do for a cigarette fix, but swallows down his reservations. Anything is better than going home and facing an angry, likely drunk Ricky.</p><p>He pulls his hood up and heads for the bus stop, eyes down. He has just enough change in his pocket for the bus, though it\u2019s mostly in pennies, so the driver isn\u2019t pleased. Dan just avoids his eye, finds a seat near the back and plugs himself into his music. It\u2019s not far to Ozone, maybe fifteen minutes. Halfway through the journey, his phone buzzes.</p><p><b>From: Phil<br>To: Dan<br>10:44pm</b><br>hey!!! Sorry I didn\u2019t make it<br>to the cafe \u2013 I drove past Amanda<br>at the fountain in town so I risked<br>it and stopped to chat :o her mates<br>left her without a way to get home<br>so we got a coffee and I drove her<br>back. Been debriefing with mum lol<br>I forgot all about coming to see u!<br>Still welcome to come over if u<br>want! Im just chilling at home but<br>gonna go to bed soon. Up to you!<br>hope work wasn\u2019t too killer :P<br>xx</p><p>Dan skims the message once, then pockets the phone without replying. His heart aches in an annoying way. All he can see is Phil and Amanda, sipping Costa coffee perched on the lip of the fountain in the town square. In some kind of cruelly ironic cinematic moment, the bus glides past this very fountain. Dan turns his face from the window.</p><p>Eventually, his stop comes up, and Dan all but runs the rest of the way. Ozone is the town\u2019s only club, and it\u2019s really more of a large bar. There\u2019s a dancefloor, sort of, and a stage, but mostly it\u2019s high tables with bar stools and hundreds of vaguely menacing drunk people, utilising the one decent place that stays open late every day. Dan slips in with a loaded glance at Ben on the door. It takes him less than five minutes to zero in on the poor sucker he\u2019ll be getting to buy him drinks tonight, and even less time to sidle up, flash a sultry smile, and ask the dude for a JD and coke, no ice.</p><p>\u201cCheeky shit,\u201d the guy says, but turns around and orders it anyway. He\u2019s tall and broad, alone with only his pint. Dan learns his name, then forgets it in the next moment. The dude doesn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cYou got any fags?\u201d Dan asks after he\u2019s listened to whatever dull shite the guy is saying for as long as he can stand. \u201cI\u2019m <i>desperate</i>.\u201d</p><p>He loads the last word, hating himself.</p><p>The guy grins, exposing a graveyard of yellowing teeth, stained from nicotine and dark beer. \u201cYeah?\u201d His fingers are scratching underneath the hem of Dan\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019ll I get in return?\u201d</p><p>Dan says nothing, just holds his gaze, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a pack of Djarums,\u201d the dude says, patting his jacket pocket. \u201cWere meant for my missus, but I could be persuaded otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre Djarums the cherry ones?\u201d Dan asks, wrinkling his nose. He\u2019s already scanning the crowd discreetly, looking for another person he could ask.</p><p>\u201cYou want \u2018em or not, princess?\u201d</p><p>Dan hesitates. The guy smells like a brewery, and his hair is thinning. Not to mention, there\u2019s a dull gold ring on his finger. But Dan hasn\u2019t had a smoke in over 24 hours, and there\u2019s no point in pretending he\u2019s about to go home. Phil is asleep by now, probably.</p><p>He smiles, holding out his hand. \u201cI want them.\u201d</p><p>The guy takes it, downs the dregs of his pint, and follows Dan through the scattered, glassy-eyed people, into the back.</p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s 3am, but Phil lets him in anyway. He\u2019s rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and his hair is sticking up, but he doesn\u2019t even ask why Dan is on his doorstep. To avoid waking everyone up, Dan had texted Phil that he was outside. He has no idea how Phil woke up to receive it.</p><p>Dan silently follows Phil up the stairs, waits patiently on the edge of his bed as Phil finds him a big t-shirt and pyjama bottoms. He changes while Phil is out of the room. When he returns, he has a glass of water in his hand, which he hands to Dan.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Phil asks, then crawls into the indent he\u2019s already left in the mattress.</p><p>Dan places the water down on Phil\u2019s bedside table, and slips in beside him. He keeps a few inches between his own limbs and Phil\u2019s at first, but inevitably Phil closes the gap. He\u2019s always been a fidgety sleeper. Dan wonders if that\u2019s the sort of thing best friends are supposed to know about each other.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like cherries,\u201d Phil mutters. He lays his fingers on Dan\u2019s arm.</p><p>There\u2019s a tight, sharp scratching at the back of Dan\u2019s throat. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s from the cigarettes. \u201cYeah. Is it gross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil says at once. He takes a deep, long breath in. \u201cSmells nice.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that guy from the bar will give him another pack. Maybe, if Dan\u2019s extra nice, and can smile just sweetly enough, he\u2019ll never have to smoke anything but Djarums, and he\u2019ll smell just like this forever, and Phil\u2019s smile will look just like this, like it does right now, every time he breathes it in.</p>",

Dan jerks away, practically growling, but Hardy&rsquo;s buddies surround him, preventing an escape.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps you should apply that smart attitude of yours to your school work, dunce,&rdquo; Hardy says, making his meathead buddies titter.</p><p>&ldquo;Dunce,&rdquo; Dan repeats. &ldquo;What an archaic turn of phrase you have. Matches your Neanderthal gait.&rdquo;</p><p>Hardy surges forwards, as if to hit him, but one of his friends grabs him, holding him back. Dan swallows discreetly. That was close. Everyone knows Hardy has a short fuse and every teacher in the school in his back pocket. If Dan wants to get out of this situation with two non-blackened eyes, he needs to dial back the smartass stuff.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, Dean, I&rsquo;m cool,&rdquo; Hardy says, pulling free of Meathead No.1. &ldquo;Listen, emo, I know you&rsquo;re bestest buds with that guy Lester.&rdquo;</p><p>Hardy waits, as if Dan will acknowledge this. He doesn&rsquo;t. Hardy grits his teeth. &ldquo;I need you to get a message to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get fucked,&rdquo; Dan says.</p><p>Something animalistic flashes across Hardy&rsquo;s eyes, and he lunges, shoving Dan back into the lockers behind him. It hurts like a bitch, but Dan just glares. Hardy is up in his face, his friends dithering around him like nervous pigeons.</p><p>&ldquo;I know who you are,&rdquo; Hardy says through his clenched jaw. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the fag that works for my father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got a Sherlock Holmes on my hands,&rdquo; Dan growls.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t try to move, despite being pinned to the lockers. If he broke free of Hardy&rsquo;s grip, he&rsquo;d have four angry, beefed up morons to deal with, and he just can&rsquo;t be bothered.</p><p>Hardy sneers at him. &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know the rumours about you, dipshit? About where you sneak off to after dark?&rdquo;</p><p>With everything he has, Dan fights to keep his face neutral. He doesn&rsquo;t say a word.</p><p>&ldquo;My Dad has shares in the Ozone club,&rdquo; Hardy continues, sneer growing into a smug grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard all the stories about you. How you throw yourself to your knees in the back rooms for every half-talented drummer that plays, every barman that has a spare twenty quid-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan kicks out, hard, catching Hardy in the shin. He roars in pain, clutching at it, and Dan breaks free. Meathead No. 2 catches him by the arm; Dan is just coming to terms with the idea that he&rsquo;s actually going to have to fight all of these dicks at once, and then a voice interrupts them.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on here? Mr Howell, I thought I sent you home.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s Mr Richardson. Bizarrely, Dan feels a wash of pure relief at the sight of his bulging vein.</p><p>&ldquo;Apologies, Sir,&rdquo; Hardy says at once. He&rsquo;s released his grip on his shin, and now has a shit-eating grin fixed in place of the furious expression he wore moments ago. &ldquo;Nothing to worry about, we were just making sure Mr Howell here wasn&rsquo;t skipping out on detention.&rdquo;</p><p>Fuck. Nothing good will come of Hardy learning his name.</p><p>Mr Richardson nods suspiciously, turning to Dan. &ldquo;Is that correct, Mr Howell?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nods silently.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. But less commotion please. School might be over for the day, but while you&rsquo;re on the premises, you treat this place with respect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Understood, Sir,&rdquo; Hardy says. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Richardson nods, then walks on, slowly, down the corridor.</p><p>Hardy waits until he gets a reasonable distance, and then turns back to Dan, jabbing a finger in his face. &ldquo;You tell Lester that he needs to back the fuck off of my girlfriend, are we clear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ex-girlfriend,&rdquo; Meathead No.1 corrects.</p><p>Hardy turns to him with a glare. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a temporary misunderstanding. She&rsquo;s a nutcase. She&rsquo;s not going to throw our relationship away over some- some- art freak!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It looks like she already has,&rdquo; Dan says, trying not to appear too amused by Hardy&rsquo;s petulant attitude.</p><p>&ldquo;Just give him the fucking message, Howell,&rdquo; Hardy snarls. He darts another glance down the corridor, where Mr Richardson is still ambling away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, I own you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan can&rsquo;t help the snort of laughter that bursts out. &ldquo;Crawl out of your dad&rsquo;s asshole, Hardy. You own squat.&rdquo;</p><p>Hardy just grins. &ldquo;Try me, Howell.&rdquo;</p><p>He holds Dan&rsquo;s gaze for a moment, then spins away, stalking down the corridor. His friends follow hot on his heels. Dan watches them for a moment, then straightens his jacket, rolls his eyes and resumes his journey to the art studio. Phil&rsquo;s warbling hasn&rsquo;t stopped the entire time, which proves just how thick-headed those idiots truly are. They wanted to find Phil to relay this &lsquo;message&rsquo;, yet failed to realise he&rsquo;s through the door ten feet away.</p><p>Dan knocks on the closed studio door, but Phil is singing too loudly to hear, so he pushes it open. There&rsquo;s an enormous, human-sized canvas in front of Phil, on which he is painting a life-size portrait of Amanda, from her mahogany curls, right down to the pointed shoes on her miniature feet. The work looks painstaking; Dan has no idea how long Phil has been working on it, but he&rsquo;d guess days. Currently, he&rsquo;s on his knees, detailing Amanda&rsquo;s fingers on her right hand, singing along as he does so.</p><p>&ldquo;You really captured her superficiality,&rdquo; Dan says, loud enough to be heard over the music.</p><p>Phil jumps slightly, then turns to Dan with a smile. &ldquo;You like her?&rdquo;</p><p>Avoiding the question, Dan ambles over to the table where Phil&rsquo;s paints are scattered. &ldquo;You sound like a dying cat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been practicing.&rdquo; &nbsp;He stands up and walks to the ancient boombox, spinning a dial to turn <i>Muse</i> down. &ldquo;What are you doing here, then? Thought you&rsquo;d already be at work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Richardson owed me a spanking,&rdquo; Dan replies, picking up a paintbrush and swirling it in a glob of crimson.</p><p>&ldquo;You got detention again? What for?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shrugs. &ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil sighs. There&rsquo;s an admonishment caught on his lip, but he doesn&rsquo;t verbalise it. Instead, he wanders over to lean on the desk beside Dan. &ldquo;Did I hear a scuffle outside? That wasn&rsquo;t you was it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shakes his head. &ldquo;Not me.&rdquo; He gestures to the portrait in front of them. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s this for? Entering the race for the Guinness World Record of creepiest stalker?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nudges him in the shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna give it to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck&rsquo;s she gonna do with it? Display it over her fireplace?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! People like getting pictures of themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>A hundred further teasing comments swirl around Dan&rsquo;s brain, but there&rsquo;s something about the tension in Phil&rsquo;s shoulders, something about the stripped back expression he wears that halts him.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good, you know,&rdquo; Dan says instead. Phil&rsquo;s eyebrows travel a short way up his forehead. Dan clears his throat and hops down off the desk before he can reply. &ldquo;Anyway, just heard your caterwauling and thought I&rsquo;d see if I could put a stop to it. I&rsquo;m off to work.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nods, a faint smile on his lips. &ldquo;Mind if I stop by later?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Go home and leave me to do my job in peace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool. I&rsquo;ll come in about seven. You can stay at mine after if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Dan says.</p><p>Inside, the relief of this offer is overwhelming. Tonight is Ricky&rsquo;s night off, so he&rsquo;ll be home all evening. Dan wonders briefly if Phil might know this, but it seems unlikely. It&rsquo;s probably just a random offer. He waves vaguely at Phil, and heads for the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;</p><p>He stops. Turns. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for saying it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p><p>Awkwardly, Dan holds his gaze for a moment. &ldquo;Yeah. No worries.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>It&rsquo;s nine fifty-three and Phil still isn&rsquo;t at the cafe. Dan has to close at ten &ndash; should already be closing up, in fact &ndash; but Phil said he&rsquo;d be here. So he waits until the last second. He begins the closing routine slowly, rinsing out the coffee machine piece by piece, taking out the tray and scrubbing it in the kitchen sink, then the grill, then the grinder too. He sweeps and mops the floor, flips the &lsquo;open&rsquo; sign to &lsquo;sorry, we&rsquo;re closed&rsquo;, but keeps the door unlocked just in case. It gets to ten-thirty, and Dan runs out of tasks to do. He needs to leave.</p><p>The nicotine craving burns at his stomach as he locks the door. The local off-licence will be closed now, but if he goes to Ozone, he might be able to snag one off Ben or someone. Maybe he could even wrangle a whole pack. He grimaces at the thought of what he might have to do for a cigarette fix, but swallows down his reservations. Anything is better than going home and facing an angry, likely drunk Ricky.</p><p>He pulls his hood up and heads for the bus stop, eyes down. He has just enough change in his pocket for the bus, though it&rsquo;s mostly in pennies, so the driver isn&rsquo;t pleased. Dan just avoids his eye, finds a seat near the back and plugs himself into his music. It&rsquo;s not far to Ozone, maybe fifteen minutes. Halfway through the journey, his phone buzzes.</p><p><b>From: Phil<br />To: Dan<br />10:44pm</b><br />hey!!! Sorry I didn&rsquo;t make it<br />to the cafe &ndash; I drove past Amanda<br />at the fountain in town so I risked<br />it and stopped to chat :o her mates<br />left her without a way to get home<br />so we got a coffee and I drove her<br />back. Been debriefing with mum lol<br />I forgot all about coming to see u!<br />Still welcome to come over if u<br />want! Im just chilling at home but<br />gonna go to bed soon. Up to you!<br />hope work wasn&rsquo;t too killer :P<br />xx</p><p>Dan skims the message once, then pockets the phone without replying. His heart aches in an annoying way. All he can see is Phil and Amanda, sipping Costa coffee perched on the lip of the fountain in the town square. In some kind of cruelly ironic cinematic moment, the bus glides past this very fountain. Dan turns his face from the window.</p><p>Eventually, his stop comes up, and Dan all but runs the rest of the way. Ozone is the town&rsquo;s only club, and it&rsquo;s really more of a large bar. There&rsquo;s a dancefloor, sort of, and a stage, but mostly it&rsquo;s high tables with bar stools and hundreds of vaguely menacing drunk people, utilising the one decent place that stays open late every day. Dan slips in with a loaded glance at Ben on the door. It takes him less than five minutes to zero in on the poor sucker he&rsquo;ll be getting to buy him drinks tonight, and even less time to sidle up, flash a sultry smile, and ask the dude for a JD and coke, no ice.</p><p>&ldquo;Cheeky shit,&rdquo; the guy says, but turns around and orders it anyway. He&rsquo;s tall and broad, alone with only his pint. Dan learns his name, then forgets it in the next moment. The dude doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.</p><p>&ldquo;You got any fags?&rdquo; Dan asks after he&rsquo;s listened to whatever dull shite the guy is saying for as long as he can stand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>desperate</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>He loads the last word, hating himself.</p><p>The guy grins, exposing a graveyard of yellowing teeth, stained from nicotine and dark beer. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; His fingers are scratching underneath the hem of Dan&rsquo;s shirt. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I get in return?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan says nothing, just holds his gaze, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a pack of Djarums,&rdquo; the dude says, patting his jacket pocket. &ldquo;Were meant for my missus, but I could be persuaded otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are Djarums the cherry ones?&rdquo; Dan asks, wrinkling his nose. He&rsquo;s already scanning the crowd discreetly, looking for another person he could ask.</p><p>&ldquo;You want &lsquo;em or not, princess?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hesitates. The guy smells like a brewery, and his hair is thinning. Not to mention, there&rsquo;s a dull gold ring on his finger. But Dan hasn&rsquo;t had a smoke in over 24 hours, and there&rsquo;s no point in pretending he&rsquo;s about to go home. Phil is asleep by now, probably.</p><p>He smiles, holding out his hand. &ldquo;I want them.&rdquo;</p><p>The guy takes it, downs the dregs of his pint, and follows Dan through the scattered, glassy-eyed people, into the back.</p><p>*</p><p>It&rsquo;s 3am, but Phil lets him in anyway. He&rsquo;s rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and his hair is sticking up, but he doesn&rsquo;t even ask why Dan is on his doorstep. To avoid waking everyone up, Dan had texted Phil that he was outside. He has no idea how Phil woke up to receive it.</p><p>Dan silently follows Phil up the stairs, waits patiently on the edge of his bed as Phil finds him a big t-shirt and pyjama bottoms. He changes while Phil is out of the room. When he returns, he has a glass of water in his hand, which he hands to Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Phil asks, then crawls into the indent he&rsquo;s already left in the mattress.</p><p>Dan places the water down on Phil&rsquo;s bedside table, and slips in beside him. He keeps a few inches between his own limbs and Phil&rsquo;s at first, but inevitably Phil closes the gap. He&rsquo;s always been a fidgety sleeper. Dan wonders if that&rsquo;s the sort of thing best friends are supposed to know about each other.</p><p>&ldquo;You smell like cherries,&rdquo; Phil mutters. He lays his fingers on Dan&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a tight, sharp scratching at the back of Dan&rsquo;s throat. He doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s from the cigarettes. &ldquo;Yeah. Is it gross?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phil says at once. He takes a deep, long breath in. &ldquo;Smells nice.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe that guy from the bar will give him another pack. Maybe, if Dan&rsquo;s extra nice, and can smile just sweetly enough, he&rsquo;ll never have to smoke anything but Djarums, and he&rsquo;ll smell just like this forever, and Phil&rsquo;s smile will look just like this, like it does right now, every time he breathes it in.</p>",
