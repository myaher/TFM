        "body": "<p>Gendry stumbled through the dark godswood, his bleary eyes searching for the figure they were used to constantly looking for these past five years, though they\u2019d finally landed on her a few moons past when he\u2019d entered the gates of Winterfell for the first time just behind Jon Snow.</p><p>R\u2019hllor, he was drunk. He hadn\u2019t meant to drink quite so much, but he\u2019d only matched her cup for cup. It had been both a challenge and a celebration. And there hadn\u2019t been cause to celebrate much for so long&hellip; The war was far from over but with the dragons, they\u2019d won a battle that would have otherwise been lost.</p><p>\u201cBet you can\u2019t keep pace.\u201d Arya had dared him, a glint in her eyes that showed she was still harboring the slightest bit of resentment for him leaving her.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t known if she\u2019d meant the drinking or dancing, but he\u2019d met her step for step and cup for cup, so she couldn\u2019t say he couldn\u2019t. And that\u2019s what had led him to this point. Stumbling through an unfamiliar courtyard in the dark, wishing he could find her, wishing he could tell her what he was feeling, wishing he could make her understand, wishing he could let her into his mind to see what he saw and feel what he felt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t regret a moment of the night though. The feeling of her hands in his during each dance. The unbidden smile that came to her lips each time he stumbled or that she stepped on his feet.</p><p>\u201cArya\u2019s never going to dance,\u201d Gendry had overheard Jon say in response to Tormund with amusement and a twinkle in his eye he watched his sister at dinner.</p><p>From the moment Arya had first grasped his hand firmly in hers, Gendry had avoided Jon\u2019s eyes. But he\u2019d seen the king\u2019s gaze darken over the course of the night as his little sister outdrank and outdanced all of his men. But the dark look wasn\u2019t for Arya; it was for Gendry. Jon still didn\u2019t know the extent of Gendry\u2019s familiarity with his sister. Gendry had a feeling it was only beginning to dawn on Jon. And if he hadn\u2019t been out here at this late hour as the celebration still dragged on in the Great Hall looking for Arya, he might have left anyway to find a spot to hide.</p><p>Gendry froze suddenly. He\u2019d heard a voice. Over the high wall to his left. He\u2019d know just the tone of that voice anywhere. Only he couldn\u2019t hear what she was saying or who she might be talking to. That way was the godswood, he knew, though he\u2019d never made a habit of being in there since he felt watched by the trees each time he stepped foot in there. But, now, in there was the only entity he truly worshipped and not a whole forest of ancient watching eyes was going to stop him from getting to her. She\u2019d have to do that herself. If she wanted.</p><p>Gendry stumbled back the way he\u2019d come until he found the entrance to the woods. There was no moon this night, so Gendry walked blindly, reaching out ahead with his arms so he didn\u2019t run into trees. A cold shiver ran down his spine as he delved further into the godswood. He could almost hear the trees speaking to him, and eerily wondered if Arya was conversing with them.</p><p>He fumbled in the dark toward the direction he thought he\u2019d heard her voice until a candlelight in the distance lit his way. Although he was bleary-eyed, he finally found her kneeling before the largest tree of them all, its red leaves long fallen and rotted on the floor next to the frozen pond. But the eyes and mouth of the tree seemed to be even more enunciated by the dark.</p><p>Arya wasn\u2019t talking anymore. But she was crying.</p><p>\u201cArry,\u201d Gendry\u2019s voice choked on the two syllables as he struggled on his uneven legs towards her, wanting to protect her from whatever it was she was suffering.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t even glance back. Which meant she\u2019d known all along he was there. Gendry fell to his knees on the cold, hard ground behind Arya and wrapped his large arms around her from behind. He\u2019d been worried she would push him away, or worse, become frozen in his arms.</p><p>Instead, she surprised him by gasping his name and turning her face towards him. Their movements jostled the candlestick which fell to the floor and sizzled out with a hiss. Gendry didn\u2019t care. He held Arya as hard as he could without hurting her instead and let her cry into his chest.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a complete stranger to her crying. But this was a different sort altogether. Released from any inhibitions by the alcohol she\u2019d consumed, she held back not a bit, and her sobs tore through her and into him as he tried to hold them both together.</p><p>He stroked her back and her hair soothingly, murmuring comforting words into her ear.</p><p>Finally, hiccupping, she looked up into his eyes unevenly. She was drunker than him. \u201cI miss him.\u201d That was all she said before curling back into his chest.</p><p>Gendry eyed the large weirwood and knew somehow without being told that it was Eddard Stark she spoke of. In his mind, Gendry heard the man\u2019s voice the same as he\u2019d heard it the one and only time he\u2019d met him.</p><p><i>Look at me, Gendry</i>, he\u2019d said, as if he\u2019d already known him somehow. Now, Gendry looked only at Lord Stark\u2019s daughter.<br/></p><p>Suddenly, Arya turned away from him, away from the weirwood and began to empty her insides. She held one hand at his chest as if to keep him away, to keep him from seeing her like that. But he didn\u2019t care; he gently set her arm aside and leaned over her, carefully gathering her hair, grown long again, up together in one hand while rubbing her back soothingly with the other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he whispered as comfortingly and as softly as he could. \u201cYou\u2019re alright,\u201d he promised.</p><p>The hand she\u2019d been using to push him away was curled up now in his own, and he brought her knuckles to his lips.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright,\u201d he whispered against her cold skin, hoping to warm her some, his other hand still rubbing her back.</p><p>Arya squeezed his hand with hers as she finished retching. Then she turned over her shoulder and smiled up at him in a way that was so achingly lovely that Gendry forgot to breathe. It wasn\u2019t that he ever forgot how beautiful she actually was; he was just so used to her again that it wasn\u2019t something he had to think about. It was just a given.</p><p>This time, though, Gendry was taken aback by it. His head, which before had been swimming in a drunken haze, was clearer than it had been for the longest time. As if he hadn\u2019t had a drink at all. One look from her sobered him up faster than a face-full of freezing cold water ever could.</p><p>In fact, it felt like nothing had ever been clearer. He saw how it had to be. They had to be together; he could never leave her side again.</p><p>Ignoring her protests and insistence that she smelled, Gendry gathered Arya tightly in his arms and to his chest. His hand held her head against him and he pressed his lips softly to her forehead. Arya stopped protesting immediately and melted into him instead.</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d She said. It was more a command than a request, but not one he could have resisted either way, though he had before if only to protect her. Now, he saw, there was no other path for them.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He kissed her again on the forehead in affirmation, leaving the word \u2018forever\u2019 unsaid though still meant.</p><p>Soon he would gather her up to his side and lead her back to her warm chambers. And he would stay just as he\u2019d promised. But, for now, he\u2019d hold her in his arms and wouldn\u2019t let go.</p>",

The unbidden smile that came to her lips each time he stumbled or that she stepped on his feet.</p><p>\u201cArya\u2019s never going to dance,\u201d Gendry had overheard Jon say in response to Tormund with amusement and a twinkle in his eye he watched his sister at dinner.</p><p>From the moment Arya had first grasped his hand firmly in hers, Gendry had avoided Jon\u2019s eyes. But he\u2019d seen the king\u2019s gaze darken over the course of the night as his little sister outdrank and outdanced all of his men. But the dark look wasn\u2019t for Arya; it was for Gendry. Jon still didn\u2019t know the extent of Gendry\u2019s familiarity with his sister. Gendry had a feeling it was only beginning to dawn on Jon. And if he hadn\u2019t been out here at this late hour as the celebration still dragged on in the Great Hall looking for Arya, he might have left anyway to find a spot to hide.</p><p>Gendry froze suddenly. He\u2019d heard a voice. Over the high wall to his left. He\u2019d know just the tone of that voice anywhere. Only he couldn\u2019t hear what she was saying or who she might be talking to. That way was the godswood, he knew, though he\u2019d never made a habit of being in there since he felt watched by the trees each time he stepped foot in there. But, now, in there was the only entity he truly worshipped and not a whole forest of ancient watching eyes was going to stop him from getting to her. She\u2019d have to do that herself. If she wanted.</p><p>Gendry stumbled back the way he\u2019d come until he found the entrance to the woods. There was no moon this night, so Gendry walked blindly, reaching out ahead with his arms so he didn\u2019t run into trees. A cold shiver ran down his spine as he delved further into the godswood. He could almost hear the trees speaking to him, and eerily wondered if Arya was conversing with them.</p><p>He fumbled in the dark toward the direction he thought he\u2019d heard her voice until a candlelight in the distance lit his way. Although he was bleary-eyed, he finally found her kneeling before the largest tree of them all, its red leaves long fallen and rotted on the floor next to the frozen pond. But the eyes and mouth of the tree seemed to be even more enunciated by the dark.</p><p>Arya wasn\u2019t talking anymore. But she was crying.</p><p>\u201cArry,\u201d Gendry\u2019s voice choked on the two syllables as he struggled on his uneven legs towards her, wanting to protect her from whatever it was she was suffering.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t even glance back. Which meant she\u2019d known all along he was there. Gendry fell to his knees on the cold, hard ground behind Arya and wrapped his large arms around her from behind. He\u2019d been worried she would push him away, or worse, become frozen in his arms.</p><p>Instead, she surprised him by gasping his name and turning her face towards him. Their movements jostled the candlestick which fell to the floor and sizzled out with a hiss. Gendry didn\u2019t care. He held Arya as hard as he could without hurting her instead and let her cry into his chest.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a complete stranger to her crying. But this was a different sort altogether. Released from any inhibitions by the alcohol she\u2019d consumed, she held back not a bit, and her sobs tore through her and into him as he tried to hold them both together.</p><p>He stroked her back and her hair soothingly, murmuring comforting words into her ear.</p><p>Finally, hiccupping, she looked up into his eyes unevenly. She was drunker than him. \u201cI miss him.\u201d That was all she said before curling back into his chest.</p><p>Gendry eyed the large weirwood and knew somehow without being told that it was Eddard Stark she spoke of. In his mind, Gendry heard the man\u2019s voice the same as he\u2019d heard it the one and only time he\u2019d met him.</p><p><i>Look at me, Gendry</i>, he\u2019d said, as if he\u2019d already known him somehow. Now, Gendry looked only at Lord Stark\u2019s daughter.<br></p><p>Suddenly, Arya turned away from him, away from the weirwood and began to empty her insides. She held one hand at his chest as if to keep him away, to keep him from seeing her like that. But he didn\u2019t care; he gently set her arm aside and leaned over her, carefully gathering her hair, grown long again, up together in one hand while rubbing her back soothingly with the other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he whispered as comfortingly and as softly as he could. \u201cYou\u2019re alright,\u201d he promised.</p><p>The hand she\u2019d been using to push him away was curled up now in his own, and he brought her knuckles to his lips.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright,\u201d he whispered against her cold skin, hoping to warm her some, his other hand still rubbing her back.</p><p>Arya squeezed his hand with hers as she finished retching. Then she turned over her shoulder and smiled up at him in a way that was so achingly lovely that Gendry forgot to breathe. It wasn\u2019t that he ever forgot how beautiful she actually was; he was just so used to her again that it wasn\u2019t something he had to think about. It was just a given.</p><p>This time, though, Gendry was taken aback by it. His head, which before had been swimming in a drunken haze, was clearer than it had been for the longest time. As if he hadn\u2019t had a drink at all. One look from her sobered him up faster than a face-full of freezing cold water ever could.</p><p>In fact, it felt like nothing had ever been clearer. He saw how it had to be. They had to be together; he could never leave her side again.</p><p>Ignoring her protests and insistence that she smelled, Gendry gathered Arya tightly in his arms and to his chest. His hand held her head against him and he pressed his lips softly to her forehead. Arya stopped protesting immediately and melted into him instead.</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d She said. It was more a command than a request, but not one he could have resisted either way, though he had before if only to protect her. Now, he saw, there was no other path for them.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d He kissed her again on the forehead in affirmation, leaving the word \u2018forever\u2019 unsaid though still meant.</p><p>Soon he would gather her up to his side and lead her back to her warm chambers. And he would stay just as he\u2019d promised. But, for now, he\u2019d hold her in his arms and wouldn\u2019t let go.</p>",
