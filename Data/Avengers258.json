It\u2019s been three weeks after your mission at the \u2018Chaud\u2019 Club<i><b> <a href=\"http://ticklikeabomb.tumblr.com/post/177728678032/pairing-avengers-x-plus-size-reader-warnings\" target=\"_blank\">(One-shot 1)</a></b></i>. Three weeks you\u2019ve been tracking the intel gathered on Dylan Rim\u2019s phone and three weeks you\u2019ve been vanishing at night to investigate your own leads. You were going out with Maya when you heard someone laugh. Discreetly you walked to the source and discovered Rogers smiling like a kid and talking to no other than Sharon Carter. You stepped in the kitchen, startling them and declared with a fake smile \u00ab Hello \u00bb Rogers shifted a little in his seat and Sharon smiled back at you \u00ab Hi I\u2019m Sharon \u00bb, she said. \u00ab I know \u00bb, you answered emotionless. She giggled and replied \u00ab I guess my reputation preceded me \u00bb You nodded doubtful and provoked her \u00ab What have you been up to. Last time I heard about you was that you were involved in the battle that divided the Avengers. \u00bb Your question caught them off guard but reading Rogers\u2019s mind, you knew he was as intrigued as you. Sharon blushed and cleared her throat \u00ab I..I had to deal with my aunts Peggy\u2019s things. \u00bb You narrowed your eyes and looked at Rogers who immediately fell smitten at the word \u2018Peggy\u2019. Sharon was good, she knew how to turn this in her favor. \u00ab Anyway have a nice day \u00bb, you spat at them. You didn\u2019t know yet but that woman was trouble. </p><p>You met Maya and caught up on your respective lifes. \u00ab How are you? Keeping yourself out of trouble? \u00bb, she asked amused. You fake gasped and replied \u00ab Me? I\u2019m a saint \u00bb, to which she laughed loudly. \u00ab Yeah yeah a saint. Hilarious \u00bb, she mumbled while taking a gulp of her water. You smirked and wiggled your eyebrows. \u00ab What about you? Everything alright? \u00bb She nodded and informed you that life was great on her side and that she missed you. You gave her a small smile and told her that you missed her too. \u00ab Maya can I ask you something? \u00bb She gave you a concerned look and you calmed her down. \u00ab It\u2019s no big deal but just wanted to ask your opinion. \u00bb She nodded and made a sign for you to continue. \u00ab If there\u2019s someone on the team that is reconnecting with someone from their past but you would find that odd or the person in question doubtful and kinda weird in the trusty way, would you tell your team mate? \u00bb She thought about it before replying \u00ab If that person is a cause to create tensions then yes I would, no matter who it is. \u00bb\u00a0</p><p>She looked at you and you sighed after hearing her thoughts. \u00ab Fine. It\u2019s Steve Rogers. I saw him today in the kitchen with Sharon Carter. I don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t trust her. She seemed way \u2018too perfect\u2019 and always using Peggy as her shield, it just makes me sick \u00bb, you revealed. Maya frowned and asked \u00ab What about her thoughts? \u00bb You let a deep breath \u00ab That\u2019s the thing she seemed to really focus and think on how to get Rogers on her bed, but it didn\u2019t fell real. \u00bb Maya nodded and confirmed you that you should tell Rogers about your gut. You ended your day and head back to the compound. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thesoldierchildren:4u_r0nf_Of8_B5ugYC7ixQ:ZgP7Yg2EiZfOT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d60abffb3f030dd533489881c9d75378/tumblr_ogoyhbv1SQ1vzvy02o4_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>You saw Wilson and Barnes on the couch and joined them. \u00ab Hey Tik and Tak, what are you watching? \u00bb, you asked amused. Barnes frowned having no idea what you just called them and Wilson gave you a small sarcastic laugh \u00ab Ha ha ha aren\u2019t you hilarious \u00bb, Wilson said. You smiled brightly and responded \u00ab Yeah I know that\u2019s actually my real talent. \u00bb They chuckled and shook their heads. You sat down with them on whatever movie they were watching when the elevator dinged. Rogers came out of it with Sharon. They were holding hands and he seemed happy. <i>\u2018Why is it always me to have to break that guy\u2019s heart?\u2019</i>, you thought. They shared a cheesy couple kiss and she left, battling her eyelashes. Wilson and Barnes were looking proud at Rogers and you were just suspicious.</p><p>\u00ab How was it? \u00bb, asked Barnes with a smile. Rogers shrugged and replied \u00ab It was really great. \u00bb Wilson congratulated him and so did Barnes. Rogers looked at you expecting your opinion but boy he was not ready for what came next. \u00ab I\u2019m glad you\u2019re good again, I just don\u2019t think going out with her is the best thing. \u00bb He frowned at your comment, hurt. \u00ab Why not? \u00bb, he said annoyed. You stood up and walked his way, trying to say it calmly. \u00ab I don\u2019t know I just think you deserve better. \u00bb He chuckled dryly and started \u00ab What do you care if I deserve better or not. Are you jealous or something? \u00bb</p><p>It was your turn to chuckle \u00ab Me jealous? Why would I be jealous Rogers? \u00bb, you asked annoyed. The tension was beginning to grow and so was our mutual anger. \u00ab Oh I don\u2019t know that maybe someone is into me and not into you \u00bb, he spat. You laughed and declared \u00ab Don\u2019t be ridiculous Rogers, that\u2019s insane. \u00bb He frowned and clenched his jaw \u00ab Well maybe if you weren\u2019t such a horrible person, someone would actually want to date you. Instead you\u2019re there dressing like a slut and making out with some fetishist ! \u00bb, he said bitterly. Your smile vanished and you slapped him hard in the face <b><i><a href=\"http://ticklikeabomb.tumblr.com/post/175479085802/the-marvel-parody-chapter-13-pairing-in-the\" target=\"_blank\">(reference to the Marvel Parody Series, Part 13)</a></i></b>. You stormed out of the place into your room and entered inside. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to lock the door and not open it on any circumstance. </p><p>Barnes and Wilson looked shocked at Rogers behavior and he left his head fall. \u00ab Dude that wasn\u2019t nice \u00bb, exclaimed Wilson. \u00ab I know I just lost it \u00bb, whispered Rogers. Barnes didn\u2019t say anything but his disappointed look told everything his best friend needed to know. Rogers made his way to your room and knocked. \u00ab Y/N\u2026 look I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what came up to me. Open up. \u00bb You gave him no response. He stood in front of your room for hours but you never answered. You stayed in your room a whole week, not wanting to see anyone. Several times a day, people would knock on your door, pleading for you to get out and at least eat something but again you would never respond. </p><p>\u00ab What the fuck Steve \u00bb, yelled Romanoff at the Soldier on day 2. \u00ab I know I know. I\u2019m trying to apologize. \u00bb She shook her head and replied \u00ab It\u2019s gonna take you way more than just stand there in front of a door and just say sorry. You slut-shamed her. You of all people and she just gave you an honest opinion. If it was me saying that Sharon wasn\u2019t the one for you, never in the world you would act that way. You should be ashamed of yourself ! \u00bb, she told him angrily and left. Rogers felt bad and indeed ashamed of his attitude. </p><p>A week later, you got out of your room and headed to the kitchen. When you entered the conversations ended and you just took your cup of coffee. \u00ab Hey Y/N how are you? \u00bb, asked Wilson. \u00ab I\u2019ve never been better \u00bb, you lied. You looked at everyone except for the Soldier who you ignored. \u00ab Is there any mission on the plate today? \u00bb, you asked Stark. \u00ab Yes just reckon. I was gonna send Clint \u00bb, he answered. You nodded and said \u00ab I\u2019ll go with him, if it\u2019s ok with you \u00bb, you turned to the Archer. He gave you a small smile and nodded. You walked out and heard Rogers call for you and on the corner where he couldn\u2019t see you, you vanished. </p><p>The reckon was alright. With Barton you got Hydra\u2019s location and got their evil plan. That\u2019s when you saw her walk. You nodged Barton in the ribs and made him turn you way. He now was your witness - Sharon Carter in flesh and bones with the enemy. He nodded and you both joined the quinjet. \u00ab She was there \u00bb, was all he said. \u00ab Yep, I knew she was fucking shady \u00bb, was the last thing you said. During the briefing Barton told them what you\u2019ve found and that Sharon was there. Again Rogers didn\u2019t want to believe it but Barton insisted that he saw it with his own eyes and he couldn\u2019t deny his friends\u2019s sayings. </p><p>The team was suited and were about to leave when they saw you in your pjs in the couch. \u00ab What the hell are you doing? \u00bb, asked Stark. You continued to read the stupid magazine in your hands and just declared \u00ab Have fun. \u00bb Barnes stepped in front of you and kneeled \u00ab Look we know you\u2019re upset right now but we need you. \u00bb You looked him in the eyes and give him a cold gaze. \u00ab No you don\u2019t and you never did. I\u2019m sure you can handle this all by yourselves. I\u2019m not coming, I\u2019m just a horrible person. \u00bb He sighed and stood up giving Rogers a deadly stare. \u00ab Fine whatever let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll deal with this later \u00bb, told Stark and they left. </p><p>Three hours later, the elevators dinged and everyone came out of it. They were bruised and their suits were half destroyed. \u00ab Seems like you had fun \u00bb, you spat sarcastically. \u00ab That\u2019s enough. You compromised the whole team with your childish behavior \u00bb, exclaimed a furious Rogers. You ignored him and walked to Barnes. \u00ab Hey baby you alright? I missed you \u00bb, you told him and everybody looked shocked. \u00ab I\u2019m ok\u2026doll missed you too. \u00bb You kissed him deeply and embraced him. You stepped out of the kiss and looked him in the eyes before whispering \u00ab You should know your targets more \u00bb and his eyes widened. You then whispered slowly so that no one else could here but only him \u00ab I\u2019m Nyx by the way \u00bb and you saw his horrified face. You took a hidden knife and sliced his throat. Everyone was either shocked or started screaming. Romanoff pointed a gun at your head and Rogers was kneeled in front of Barnes. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"222\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"imaginary-desires:whCKMQJpA1ELbUhnduFBFw:ZZJDLd2SC-9PN\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5688ba88dcc1f3baa1bbb377398bff66/tumblr_ozh7k0ApMB1wvuj0co1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"222\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>The next thing heard in the room was the elevator. Barnes came out of it, confused of the scene in front of him. Rogers looked back at the body in front of him and saw the body transform. \u00ab It\u2019s a shapeshifter \u00bb, you exclaimed. Romanoff put down her gun and you continued \u00ab You really think I was dating Barnes? How couldn\u2019t you notice that it wasn\u2019t him. \u00bb No one said anything. \u00ab How? How? did you? \u00bb, stuttered Rogers. You chuckled dryly. \u00ab Barnes always has an elastic hair on his right wrist in case he wants to put them in a man-bun, his posture was different and when I embraced him his arm, well no metal. And clearly he thought we were together which we aren\u2019t. \u00bb Rogers stood up dumbfounded and you spat at him \u00ab I just solved this case, here in the compound, in my pjs. You\u2019re welcome. \u00bb You were about to leave when you turned around and declared \u00ab Your girl Sharon \u00bb and you pointed to the body, \u00ab It wasn\u2019t the real one, that\u2019s why she seemed odd to me and I told you, you deserved better. \u00bb With that said you left to your room. A few hours later, F.R.I.D.A.Y confirmed you that Stark managed to find Sharon Carter tied to a chair in another state. </p><p>It took you five months to forgive Rogers for his attitude. At the beginning you would come with them on missions and follow the instructions but as soon you were at the compound, you shut the Soldier off your life. He was desperate and did everything he could to have your forgiveness, telling you he didn\u2019t mean what he said, that his attitude was horrible and that he trusted you with his whole being. Five months later you forgave him and included him back in your life.\u00a0</p><p><b>*gifs not mine, credit to owner*</b></p><p><b>TAG LIST for the SERIES</b> : <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\" target=\"_blank\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNuJ8C6EqD_67zjxrHZtBbg\" target=\"_blank\">@buckybarneslemons</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOGAtG9_S-lbjf27Nr1pLzg\" target=\"_blank\">@brennan1618</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6KjREyEM6_h8vhKV4C3FtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@alexfayer</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_elqr83Pqn0eGXSptaznaA\" target=\"_blank\">@totally-alexa21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moj7Oc2DZ2MiCZeDDg1yGAw\" target=\"_blank\">@lovesteverogersbaeworld</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRVTn1jahXLpD9Wr4-8Q1cA\" target=\"_blank\">@bulbachu13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg1Cop7_uIHrZgAe6F08DCg\" target=\"_blank\">@oliviajmarvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAS8e4XrbAZVnLM9Fxou_fA\" target=\"_blank\">@the-lachrymose-one</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCQXLBP-e3ar0rrwHcWggg\" target=\"_blank\">@poetic-pixie</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtwAHvrimCwB-xOdfQvTTOw\" target=\"_blank\">@kendrawr-kitkat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_ik-26PqcRnVKl0vbydvCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@5aftermidnight</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmUk-3I9DGdts5TUy6qFHg\" target=\"_blank\">@hoibetty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYzOQjgWuDGRSUGqki9A5sQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thewayilookatbacon</a> @d0nt-apologise <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnACC_JshwcEYFiYErsctjw\" target=\"_blank\">@wakandaforever11</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLcl0ZmD86Dpd16SkT0g-1w\" target=\"_blank\">@multifandom-reallyamess</a> @depressivegoblin <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO2yyIQqQnd0a3gbW8lzk2g\" target=\"_blank\">@xxleannewardxx</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3emKnPL5XbJ9iqsE-l7Imw\" target=\"_blank\">@pixiehex1985</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX7VaMOXaTcQ3PuiE8xX8Pg\" target=\"_blank\">@kittyjs123</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\" target=\"_blank\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r0Z83vxCNxu61ii2DIi6w\" target=\"_blank\">@gaylemonshark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moffUH_LgH-mYCzwxiG99Aw\" target=\"_blank\">@ludmi0u0</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mytAUV2gKaOrbNnxgzTtYfQ\" target=\"_blank\">@missphoenix69</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAFfKJc5cRm1VdTDpK4e3FQ\" target=\"_blank\">@marshmallow-witch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkUlU4PeTjZAC7DVI1SQA2Q\" target=\"_blank\">@everydayisonfire</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-wGk15bGrCJhe6BHElm90A\" target=\"_blank\">@papayapagan</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjt_GfGRXLxFyH2LIuNfPtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@llfuture-disney-princessll-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvzqK2EH3rTaVFiMK8NJ9gA\" target=\"_blank\">@clockworkmorningglory</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmvRpuSWzlyumW0TxBEvYGg\" target=\"_blank\">@angieptt</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSybi4jvI05dGI64klKbnuQ\" target=\"_blank\">@shockwavee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\" target=\"_blank\">@lilulo-12</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\" target=\"_blank\">@introvertedsin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqtrCF2Zs3_quWSX4dAyiJw\" target=\"_blank\">@ismeewhores</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw12zrVmzmGtZLdQ-0rIYTA\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfictionrecommendations-com</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7rXAgLvNHsSUkb8lGnyeg\" target=\"_blank\">@wildsoul1221</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVFWgbxy6uE7nyh7nrquQPw\" target=\"_blank\">@prettybubblesintheair</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muIMbGBGHBRBSh_vW3WaBYg\" target=\"_blank\">@wayward-timetravel-collecter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yiskJOcz7k_nOLRaHq7iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@lokithedancingqueen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6e0nhW809mI7ErYzKY-7ag\" target=\"_blank\">@francezka10</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muanS215gWWOGywv2cvjZuA\" target=\"_blank\">@tnupsweetpie</a></p>",

It\u2019s been three weeks after your mission at the \u2018Chaud\u2019 Club<i><b> <a href=\"http://ticklikeabomb.tumblr.com/post/177728678032/pairing-avengers-x-plus-size-reader-warnings\" target=\"_blank\">(One-shot 1)</a></b></i>. Three weeks you\u2019ve been tracking the intel gathered on Dylan Rim\u2019s phone and three weeks you\u2019ve been vanishing at night to investigate your own leads. You were going out with Maya when you heard someone laugh. Discreetly you walked to the source and discovered Rogers smiling like a kid and talking to no other than Sharon Carter. You stepped in the kitchen, startling them and declared with a fake smile \u00ab Hello \u00bb Rogers shifted a little in his seat and Sharon smiled back at you \u00ab Hi I\u2019m Sharon \u00bb, she said. \u00ab I know \u00bb, you answered emotionless. She giggled and replied \u00ab I guess my reputation preceded me \u00bb You nodded doubtful and provoked her \u00ab What have you been up to. Last time I heard about you was that you were involved in the battle that divided the Avengers. \u00bb Your question caught them off guard but reading Rogers\u2019s mind, you knew he was as intrigued as you. Sharon blushed and cleared her throat \u00ab I..I had to deal with my aunts Peggy\u2019s things. \u00bb You narrowed your eyes and looked at Rogers who immediately fell smitten at the word \u2018Peggy\u2019. Sharon was good, she knew how to turn this in her favor. \u00ab Anyway have a nice day \u00bb, you spat at them. You didn\u2019t know yet but that woman was trouble. </p><p>You met Maya and caught up on your respective lifes. \u00ab How are you? Keeping yourself out of trouble? \u00bb, she asked amused. You fake gasped and replied \u00ab Me? I\u2019m a saint \u00bb, to which she laughed loudly. \u00ab Yeah yeah a saint. Hilarious \u00bb, she mumbled while taking a gulp of her water. You smirked and wiggled your eyebrows. \u00ab What about you? Everything alright? \u00bb She nodded and informed you that life was great on her side and that she missed you. You gave her a small smile and told her that you missed her too. \u00ab Maya can I ask you something? \u00bb She gave you a concerned look and you calmed her down. \u00ab It\u2019s no big deal but just wanted to ask your opinion. \u00bb She nodded and made a sign for you to continue. \u00ab If there\u2019s someone on the team that is reconnecting with someone from their past but you would find that odd or the person in question doubtful and kinda weird in the trusty way, would you tell your team mate? \u00bb She thought about it before replying \u00ab If that person is a cause to create tensions then yes I would, no matter who it is. \u00bb\u00a0</p><p>She looked at you and you sighed after hearing her thoughts. \u00ab Fine. It\u2019s Steve Rogers. I saw him today in the kitchen with Sharon Carter. I don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t trust her. She seemed way \u2018too perfect\u2019 and always using Peggy as her shield, it just makes me sick \u00bb, you revealed. Maya frowned and asked \u00ab What about her thoughts? \u00bb You let a deep breath \u00ab That\u2019s the thing she seemed to really focus and think on how to get Rogers on her bed, but it didn\u2019t fell real. \u00bb Maya nodded and confirmed you that you should tell Rogers about your gut. You ended your day and head back to the compound. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thesoldierchildren:4u_r0nf_Of8_B5ugYC7ixQ:ZgP7Yg2EiZfOT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d60abffb3f030dd533489881c9d75378/tumblr_ogoyhbv1SQ1vzvy02o4_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>You saw Wilson and Barnes on the couch and joined them. \u00ab Hey Tik and Tak, what are you watching? \u00bb, you asked amused. Barnes frowned having no idea what you just called them and Wilson gave you a small sarcastic laugh \u00ab Ha ha ha aren\u2019t you hilarious \u00bb, Wilson said. You smiled brightly and responded \u00ab Yeah I know that\u2019s actually my real talent. \u00bb They chuckled and shook their heads. You sat down with them on whatever movie they were watching when the elevator dinged. Rogers came out of it with Sharon. They were holding hands and he seemed happy. <i>\u2018Why is it always me to have to break that guy\u2019s heart?\u2019</i>, you thought. They shared a cheesy couple kiss and she left, battling her eyelashes. Wilson and Barnes were looking proud at Rogers and you were just suspicious.</p><p>\u00ab How was it? \u00bb, asked Barnes with a smile. Rogers shrugged and replied \u00ab It was really great. \u00bb Wilson congratulated him and so did Barnes. Rogers looked at you expecting your opinion but boy he was not ready for what came next. \u00ab I\u2019m glad you\u2019re good again, I just don\u2019t think going out with her is the best thing. \u00bb He frowned at your comment, hurt. \u00ab Why not? \u00bb, he said annoyed. You stood up and walked his way, trying to say it calmly. \u00ab I don\u2019t know I just think you deserve better. \u00bb He chuckled dryly and started \u00ab What do you care if I deserve better or not. Are you jealous or something? \u00bb</p><p>It was your turn to chuckle \u00ab Me jealous? Why would I be jealous Rogers? \u00bb, you asked annoyed. The tension was beginning to grow and so was our mutual anger. \u00ab Oh I don\u2019t know that maybe someone is into me and not into you \u00bb, he spat. You laughed and declared \u00ab Don\u2019t be ridiculous Rogers, that\u2019s insane. \u00bb He frowned and clenched his jaw \u00ab Well maybe if you weren\u2019t such a horrible person, someone would actually want to date you. Instead you\u2019re there dressing like a slut and making out with some fetishist ! \u00bb, he said bitterly. Your smile vanished and you slapped him hard in the face <b><i><a href=\"http://ticklikeabomb.tumblr.com/post/175479085802/the-marvel-parody-chapter-13-pairing-in-the\" target=\"_blank\">(reference to the Marvel Parody Series, Part 13)</a></i></b>. You stormed out of the place into your room and entered inside. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to lock the door and not open it on any circumstance. </p><p>Barnes and Wilson looked shocked at Rogers behavior and he left his head fall. \u00ab Dude that wasn\u2019t nice \u00bb, exclaimed Wilson. \u00ab I know I just lost it \u00bb, whispered Rogers. Barnes didn\u2019t say anything but his disappointed look told everything his best friend needed to know. Rogers made his way to your room and knocked. \u00ab Y/N\u2026 look I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what came up to me. Open up. \u00bb You gave him no response. He stood in front of your room for hours but you never answered. You stayed in your room a whole week, not wanting to see anyone. Several times a day, people would knock on your door, pleading for you to get out and at least eat something but again you would never respond. </p><p>\u00ab What the fuck Steve \u00bb, yelled Romanoff at the Soldier on day 2. \u00ab I know I know. I\u2019m trying to apologize. \u00bb She shook her head and replied \u00ab It\u2019s gonna take you way more than just stand there in front of a door and just say sorry. You slut-shamed her. You of all people and she just gave you an honest opinion. If it was me saying that Sharon wasn\u2019t the one for you, never in the world you would act that way. You should be ashamed of yourself ! \u00bb, she told him angrily and left. Rogers felt bad and indeed ashamed of his attitude. </p><p>A week later, you got out of your room and headed to the kitchen. When you entered the conversations ended and you just took your cup of coffee. \u00ab Hey Y/N how are you? \u00bb, asked Wilson. \u00ab I\u2019ve never been better \u00bb, you lied. You looked at everyone except for the Soldier who you ignored. \u00ab Is there any mission on the plate today? \u00bb, you asked Stark. \u00ab Yes just reckon. I was gonna send Clint \u00bb, he answered. You nodded and said \u00ab I\u2019ll go with him, if it\u2019s ok with you \u00bb, you turned to the Archer. He gave you a small smile and nodded. You walked out and heard Rogers call for you and on the corner where he couldn\u2019t see you, you vanished. </p><p>The reckon was alright. With Barton you got Hydra\u2019s location and got their evil plan. That\u2019s when you saw her walk. You nodged Barton in the ribs and made him turn you way. He now was your witness - Sharon Carter in flesh and bones with the enemy. He nodded and you both joined the quinjet. \u00ab She was there \u00bb, was all he said. \u00ab Yep, I knew she was fucking shady \u00bb, was the last thing you said. During the briefing Barton told them what you\u2019ve found and that Sharon was there. Again Rogers didn\u2019t want to believe it but Barton insisted that he saw it with his own eyes and he couldn\u2019t deny his friends\u2019s sayings. </p><p>The team was suited and were about to leave when they saw you in your pjs in the couch. \u00ab What the hell are you doing? \u00bb, asked Stark. You continued to read the stupid magazine in your hands and just declared \u00ab Have fun. \u00bb Barnes stepped in front of you and kneeled \u00ab Look we know you\u2019re upset right now but we need you. \u00bb You looked him in the eyes and give him a cold gaze. \u00ab No you don\u2019t and you never did. I\u2019m sure you can handle this all by yourselves. I\u2019m not coming, I\u2019m just a horrible person. \u00bb He sighed and stood up giving Rogers a deadly stare. \u00ab Fine whatever let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll deal with this later \u00bb, told Stark and they left. </p><p>Three hours later, the elevators dinged and everyone came out of it. They were bruised and their suits were half destroyed. \u00ab Seems like you had fun \u00bb, you spat sarcastically. \u00ab That\u2019s enough. You compromised the whole team with your childish behavior \u00bb, exclaimed a furious Rogers. You ignored him and walked to Barnes. \u00ab Hey baby you alright? I missed you \u00bb, you told him and everybody looked shocked. \u00ab I\u2019m ok\u2026doll missed you too. \u00bb You kissed him deeply and embraced him. You stepped out of the kiss and looked him in the eyes before whispering \u00ab You should know your targets more \u00bb and his eyes widened. You then whispered slowly so that no one else could here but only him \u00ab I\u2019m Nyx by the way \u00bb and you saw his horrified face. You took a hidden knife and sliced his throat. Everyone was either shocked or started screaming. Romanoff pointed a gun at your head and Rogers was kneeled in front of Barnes. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"222\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"imaginary-desires:whCKMQJpA1ELbUhnduFBFw:ZZJDLd2SC-9PN\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5688ba88dcc1f3baa1bbb377398bff66/tumblr_ozh7k0ApMB1wvuj0co1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"222\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>The next thing heard in the room was the elevator. Barnes came out of it, confused of the scene in front of him. Rogers looked back at the body in front of him and saw the body transform. \u00ab It\u2019s a shapeshifter \u00bb, you exclaimed. Romanoff put down her gun and you continued \u00ab You really think I was dating Barnes? How couldn\u2019t you notice that it wasn\u2019t him. \u00bb No one said anything. \u00ab How? How? did you? \u00bb, stuttered Rogers. You chuckled dryly. \u00ab Barnes always has an elastic hair on his right wrist in case he wants to put them in a man-bun, his posture was different and when I embraced him his arm, well no metal. And clearly he thought we were together which we aren\u2019t. \u00bb Rogers stood up dumbfounded and you spat at him \u00ab I just solved this case, here in the compound, in my pjs. You\u2019re welcome. \u00bb You were about to leave when you turned around and declared \u00ab Your girl Sharon \u00bb and you pointed to the body, \u00ab It wasn\u2019t the real one, that\u2019s why she seemed odd to me and I told you, you deserved better. \u00bb With that said you left to your room. A few hours later, F.R.I.D.A.Y confirmed you that Stark managed to find Sharon Carter tied to a chair in another state. </p><p>It took you five months to forgive Rogers for his attitude. At the beginning you would come with them on missions and follow the instructions but as soon you were at the compound, you shut the Soldier off your life. He was desperate and did everything he could to have your forgiveness, telling you he didn\u2019t mean what he said, that his attitude was horrible and that he trusted you with his whole being. Five months later you forgave him and included him back in your life.\u00a0</p><p><b>*gifs not mine, credit to owner*</b></p><p><b>TAG LIST for the SERIES</b> : <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\" target=\"_blank\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNuJ8C6EqD_67zjxrHZtBbg\" target=\"_blank\">@buckybarneslemons</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOGAtG9_S-lbjf27Nr1pLzg\" target=\"_blank\">@brennan1618</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6KjREyEM6_h8vhKV4C3FtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@alexfayer</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_elqr83Pqn0eGXSptaznaA\" target=\"_blank\">@totally-alexa21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moj7Oc2DZ2MiCZeDDg1yGAw\" target=\"_blank\">@lovesteverogersbaeworld</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRVTn1jahXLpD9Wr4-8Q1cA\" target=\"_blank\">@bulbachu13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg1Cop7_uIHrZgAe6F08DCg\" target=\"_blank\">@oliviajmarvel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAS8e4XrbAZVnLM9Fxou_fA\" target=\"_blank\">@the-lachrymose-one</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCQXLBP-e3ar0rrwHcWggg\" target=\"_blank\">@poetic-pixie</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtwAHvrimCwB-xOdfQvTTOw\" target=\"_blank\">@kendrawr-kitkat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_ik-26PqcRnVKl0vbydvCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@5aftermidnight</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmUk-3I9DGdts5TUy6qFHg\" target=\"_blank\">@hoibetty</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYzOQjgWuDGRSUGqki9A5sQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thewayilookatbacon</a> @d0nt-apologise <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnACC_JshwcEYFiYErsctjw\" target=\"_blank\">@wakandaforever11</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLcl0ZmD86Dpd16SkT0g-1w\" target=\"_blank\">@multifandom-reallyamess</a> @depressivegoblin <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO2yyIQqQnd0a3gbW8lzk2g\" target=\"_blank\">@xxleannewardxx</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3emKnPL5XbJ9iqsE-l7Imw\" target=\"_blank\">@pixiehex1985</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX7VaMOXaTcQ3PuiE8xX8Pg\" target=\"_blank\">@kittyjs123</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\" target=\"_blank\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r0Z83vxCNxu61ii2DIi6w\" target=\"_blank\">@gaylemonshark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moffUH_LgH-mYCzwxiG99Aw\" target=\"_blank\">@ludmi0u0</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mytAUV2gKaOrbNnxgzTtYfQ\" target=\"_blank\">@missphoenix69</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAFfKJc5cRm1VdTDpK4e3FQ\" target=\"_blank\">@marshmallow-witch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkUlU4PeTjZAC7DVI1SQA2Q\" target=\"_blank\">@everydayisonfire</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-wGk15bGrCJhe6BHElm90A\" target=\"_blank\">@papayapagan</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjt_GfGRXLxFyH2LIuNfPtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@llfuture-disney-princessll-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvzqK2EH3rTaVFiMK8NJ9gA\" target=\"_blank\">@clockworkmorningglory</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmvRpuSWzlyumW0TxBEvYGg\" target=\"_blank\">@angieptt</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSybi4jvI05dGI64klKbnuQ\" target=\"_blank\">@shockwavee</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\" target=\"_blank\">@lilulo-12</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\" target=\"_blank\">@introvertedsin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqtrCF2Zs3_quWSX4dAyiJw\" target=\"_blank\">@ismeewhores</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw12zrVmzmGtZLdQ-0rIYTA\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfictionrecommendations-com</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7rXAgLvNHsSUkb8lGnyeg\" target=\"_blank\">@wildsoul1221</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVFWgbxy6uE7nyh7nrquQPw\" target=\"_blank\">@prettybubblesintheair</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muIMbGBGHBRBSh_vW3WaBYg\" target=\"_blank\">@wayward-timetravel-collecter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yiskJOcz7k_nOLRaHq7iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@lokithedancingqueen</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6e0nhW809mI7ErYzKY-7ag\" target=\"_blank\">@francezka10</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muanS215gWWOGywv2cvjZuA\" target=\"_blank\">@tnupsweetpie</a></p></p>",

Three weeks you\u2019ve been tracking the intel gathered on Dylan Rim\u2019s phone and three weeks you\u2019ve been vanishing at night to investigate your own leads. You were going out with Maya when you heard someone laugh. Discreetly you walked to the source and discovered Rogers smiling like a kid and talking to no other than Sharon Carter. You stepped in the kitchen, startling them and declared with a fake smile \u00ab Hello \u00bb Rogers shifted a little in his seat and Sharon smiled back at you \u00ab Hi I\u2019m Sharon \u00bb, she said. \u00ab I know \u00bb, you answered emotionless. She giggled and replied \u00ab I guess my reputation preceded me \u00bb You nodded doubtful and provoked her \u00ab What have you been up to. Last time I heard about you was that you were involved in the battle that divided the Avengers. \u00bb Your question caught them off guard but reading Rogers\u2019s mind, you knew he was as intrigued as you. Sharon blushed and cleared her throat \u00ab I..I had to deal with my aunts Peggy\u2019s things. \u00bb You narrowed your eyes and looked at Rogers who immediately fell smitten at the word \u2018Peggy\u2019. Sharon was good, she knew how to turn this in her favor. \u00ab Anyway have a nice day \u00bb, you spat at them. You didn\u2019t know yet but that woman was trouble. </p><p>You met Maya and caught up on your respective lifes. \u00ab How are you? Keeping yourself out of trouble? \u00bb, she asked amused. You fake gasped and replied \u00ab Me? I\u2019m a saint \u00bb, to which she laughed loudly. \u00ab Yeah yeah a saint. Hilarious \u00bb, she mumbled while taking a gulp of her water. You smirked and wiggled your eyebrows. \u00ab What about you? Everything alright? \u00bb She nodded and informed you that life was great on her side and that she missed you. You gave her a small smile and told her that you missed her too. \u00ab Maya can I ask you something? \u00bb She gave you a concerned look and you calmed her down. \u00ab It\u2019s no big deal but just wanted to ask your opinion. \u00bb She nodded and made a sign for you to continue. \u00ab If there\u2019s someone on the team that is reconnecting with someone from their past but you would find that odd or the person in question doubtful and kinda weird in the trusty way, would you tell your team mate? \u00bb She thought about it before replying \u00ab If that person is a cause to create tensions then yes I would, no matter who it is. \u00bb\u00a0</p><p>She looked at you and you sighed after hearing her thoughts. \u00ab Fine. It\u2019s Steve Rogers. I saw him today in the kitchen with Sharon Carter. I don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t trust her. She seemed way \u2018too perfect\u2019 and always using Peggy as her shield, it just makes me sick \u00bb, you revealed. Maya frowned and asked \u00ab What about her thoughts? \u00bb You let a deep breath \u00ab That\u2019s the thing she seemed to really focus and think on how to get Rogers on her bed, but it didn\u2019t fell real. \u00bb Maya nodded and confirmed you that you should tell Rogers about your gut. You ended your day and head back to the compound. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thesoldierchildren:4u_r0nf_Of8_B5ugYC7ixQ:ZgP7Yg2EiZfOT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d60abffb3f030dd533489881c9d75378/tumblr_ogoyhbv1SQ1vzvy02o4_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>You saw Wilson and Barnes on the couch and joined them. \u00ab Hey Tik and Tak, what are you watching? \u00bb, you asked amused. Barnes frowned having no idea what you just called them and Wilson gave you a small sarcastic laugh \u00ab Ha ha ha aren\u2019t you hilarious \u00bb, Wilson said. You smiled brightly and responded \u00ab Yeah I know that\u2019s actually my real talent. \u00bb They chuckled and shook their heads. You sat down with them on whatever movie they were watching when the elevator dinged. Rogers came out of it with Sharon. They were holding hands and he seemed happy. <i>\u2018Why is it always me to have to break that guy\u2019s heart?\u2019</i>, you thought. They shared a cheesy couple kiss and she left, battling her eyelashes. Wilson and Barnes were looking proud at Rogers and you were just suspicious.</p><p>\u00ab How was it? \u00bb, asked Barnes with a smile. Rogers shrugged and replied \u00ab It was really great. \u00bb Wilson congratulated him and so did Barnes. Rogers looked at you expecting your opinion but boy he was not ready for what came next. \u00ab I\u2019m glad you\u2019re good again, I just don\u2019t think going out with her is the best thing. \u00bb He frowned at your comment, hurt. \u00ab Why not? \u00bb, he said annoyed. You stood up and walked his way, trying to say it calmly. \u00ab I don\u2019t know I just think you deserve better. \u00bb He chuckled dryly and started \u00ab What do you care if I deserve better or not. Are you jealous or something? \u00bb</p><p>It was your turn to chuckle \u00ab Me jealous? Why would I be jealous Rogers? \u00bb, you asked annoyed. The tension was beginning to grow and so was our mutual anger. \u00ab Oh I don\u2019t know that maybe someone is into me and not into you \u00bb, he spat. You laughed and declared \u00ab Don\u2019t be ridiculous Rogers, that\u2019s insane. \u00bb He frowned and clenched his jaw \u00ab Well maybe if you weren\u2019t such a horrible person, someone would actually want to date you. Instead you\u2019re there dressing like a slut and making out with some fetishist ! \u00bb, he said bitterly. Your smile vanished and you slapped him hard in the face <b><i><a href=\"http://ticklikeabomb.tumblr.com/post/175479085802/the-marvel-parody-chapter-13-pairing-in-the\" target=\"_blank\">(reference to the Marvel Parody Series, Part 13)</a></i></b>. You stormed out of the place into your room and entered inside. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to lock the door and not open it on any circumstance. </p><p>Barnes and Wilson looked shocked at Rogers behavior and he left his head fall. \u00ab Dude that wasn\u2019t nice \u00bb, exclaimed Wilson. \u00ab I know I just lost it \u00bb, whispered Rogers. Barnes didn\u2019t say anything but his disappointed look told everything his best friend needed to know. Rogers made his way to your room and knocked. \u00ab Y/N\u2026 look I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what came up to me. Open up. \u00bb You gave him no response. He stood in front of your room for hours but you never answered. You stayed in your room a whole week, not wanting to see anyone. Several times a day, people would knock on your door, pleading for you to get out and at least eat something but again you would never respond. </p><p>\u00ab What the fuck Steve \u00bb, yelled Romanoff at the Soldier on day 2. \u00ab I know I know. I\u2019m trying to apologize. \u00bb She shook her head and replied \u00ab It\u2019s gonna take you way more than just stand there in front of a door and just say sorry. You slut-shamed her. You of all people and she just gave you an honest opinion. If it was me saying that Sharon wasn\u2019t the one for you, never in the world you would act that way. You should be ashamed of yourself ! \u00bb, she told him angrily and left. Rogers felt bad and indeed ashamed of his attitude. </p><p>A week later, you got out of your room and headed to the kitchen. When you entered the conversations ended and you just took your cup of coffee. \u00ab Hey Y/N how are you? \u00bb, asked Wilson. \u00ab I\u2019ve never been better \u00bb, you lied. You looked at everyone except for the Soldier who you ignored. \u00ab Is there any mission on the plate today? \u00bb, you asked Stark. \u00ab Yes just reckon. I was gonna send Clint \u00bb, he answered. You nodded and said \u00ab I\u2019ll go with him, if it\u2019s ok with you \u00bb, you turned to the Archer. He gave you a small smile and nodded. You walked out and heard Rogers call for you and on the corner where he couldn\u2019t see you, you vanished. </p><p>The reckon was alright. With Barton you got Hydra\u2019s location and got their evil plan. That\u2019s when you saw her walk. You nodged Barton in the ribs and made him turn you way. He now was your witness - Sharon Carter in flesh and bones with the enemy. He nodded and you both joined the quinjet. \u00ab She was there \u00bb, was all he said. \u00ab Yep, I knew she was fucking shady \u00bb, was the last thing you said. During the briefing Barton told them what you\u2019ve found and that Sharon was there. Again Rogers didn\u2019t want to believe it but Barton insisted that he saw it with his own eyes and he couldn\u2019t deny his friends\u2019s sayings. </p><p>The team was suited and were about to leave when they saw you in your pjs in the couch. \u00ab What the hell are you doing? \u00bb, asked Stark. You continued to read the stupid magazine in your hands and just declared \u00ab Have fun. \u00bb Barnes stepped in front of you and kneeled \u00ab Look we know you\u2019re upset right now but we need you. \u00bb You looked him in the eyes and give him a cold gaze. \u00ab No you don\u2019t and you never did. I\u2019m sure you can handle this all by yourselves. I\u2019m not coming, I\u2019m just a horrible person. \u00bb He sighed and stood up giving Rogers a deadly stare. \u00ab Fine whatever let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll deal with this later \u00bb, told Stark and they left. </p><p>Three hours later, the elevators dinged and everyone came out of it. They were bruised and their suits were half destroyed. \u00ab Seems like you had fun \u00bb, you spat sarcastically. \u00ab That\u2019s enough. You compromised the whole team with your childish behavior \u00bb, exclaimed a furious Rogers. You ignored him and walked to Barnes. \u00ab Hey baby you alright? I missed you \u00bb, you told him and everybody looked shocked. \u00ab I\u2019m ok\u2026doll missed you too. \u00bb You kissed him deeply and embraced him. You stepped out of the kiss and looked him in the eyes before whispering \u00ab You should know your targets more \u00bb and his eyes widened. You then whispered slowly so that no one else could here but only him \u00ab I\u2019m Nyx by the way \u00bb and you saw his horrified face. You took a hidden knife and sliced his throat. Everyone was either shocked or started screaming. Romanoff pointed a gun at your head and Rogers was kneeled in front of Barnes. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"222\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"imaginary-desires:whCKMQJpA1ELbUhnduFBFw:ZZJDLd2SC-9PN\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5688ba88dcc1f3baa1bbb377398bff66/tumblr_ozh7k0ApMB1wvuj0co1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"222\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>The next thing heard in the room was the elevator. Barnes came out of it, confused of the scene in front of him. Rogers looked back at the body in front of him and saw the body transform. \u00ab It\u2019s a shapeshifter \u00bb, you exclaimed. Romanoff put down her gun and you continued \u00ab You really think I was dating Barnes? How couldn\u2019t you notice that it wasn\u2019t him. \u00bb No one said anything. \u00ab How? How? did you? \u00bb, stuttered Rogers. You chuckled dryly. \u00ab Barnes always has an elastic hair on his right wrist in case he wants to put them in a man-bun, his posture was different and when I embraced him his arm, well no metal. And clearly he thought we were together which we aren\u2019t. \u00bb Rogers stood up dumbfounded and you spat at him \u00ab I just solved this case, here in the compound, in my pjs. You\u2019re welcome. \u00bb You were about to leave when you turned around and declared \u00ab Your girl Sharon \u00bb and you pointed to the body, \u00ab It wasn\u2019t the real one, that\u2019s why she seemed odd to me and I told you, you deserved better. \u00bb With that said you left to your room. A few hours later, F.R.I.D.A.Y confirmed you that Stark managed to find Sharon Carter tied to a chair in another state. </p><p>It took you five months to forgive Rogers for his attitude.

Three weeks you&rsquo;ve been tracking the intel gathered on Dylan Rim&rsquo;s phone and three weeks you&rsquo;ve been vanishing at night to investigate your own leads. You were going out with Maya when you heard someone laugh. Discreetly you walked to the source and discovered Rogers smiling like a kid and talking to no other than Sharon Carter. You stepped in the kitchen, startling them and declared with a fake smile &laquo; Hello &raquo; Rogers shifted a little in his seat and Sharon smiled back at you &laquo; Hi I&rsquo;m Sharon &raquo;, she said. &laquo; I know &raquo;, you answered emotionless. She giggled and replied &laquo; I guess my reputation preceded me &raquo; You nodded doubtful and provoked her &laquo; What have you been up to. Last time I heard about you was that you were involved in the battle that divided the Avengers. &raquo; Your question caught them off guard but reading Rogers&rsquo;s mind, you knew he was as intrigued as you. Sharon blushed and cleared her throat &laquo; I..I had to deal with my aunts Peggy&rsquo;s things. &raquo; You narrowed your eyes and looked at Rogers who immediately fell smitten at the word &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo;. Sharon was good, she knew how to turn this in her favor. &laquo; Anyway have a nice day &raquo;, you spat at them. You didn&rsquo;t know yet but that woman was trouble. </p><p>You met Maya and caught up on your respective lifes. &laquo; How are you? Keeping yourself out of trouble? &raquo;, she asked amused. You fake gasped and replied &laquo; Me? I&rsquo;m a saint &raquo;, to which she laughed loudly. &laquo; Yeah yeah a saint. Hilarious &raquo;, she mumbled while taking a gulp of her water. You smirked and wiggled your eyebrows. &laquo; What about you? Everything alright? &raquo; She nodded and informed you that life was great on her side and that she missed you. You gave her a small smile and told her that you missed her too. &laquo; Maya can I ask you something? &raquo; She gave you a concerned look and you calmed her down. &laquo; It&rsquo;s no big deal but just wanted to ask your opinion. &raquo; She nodded and made a sign for you to continue. &laquo; If there&rsquo;s someone on the team that is reconnecting with someone from their past but you would find that odd or the person in question doubtful and kinda weird in the trusty way, would you tell your team mate? &raquo; She thought about it before replying &laquo; If that person is a cause to create tensions then yes I would, no matter who it is. &raquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She looked at you and you sighed after hearing her thoughts. &laquo; Fine. It&rsquo;s Steve Rogers. I saw him today in the kitchen with Sharon Carter. I don&rsquo;t know but I don&rsquo;t trust her. She seemed way &lsquo;too perfect&rsquo; and always using Peggy as her shield, it just makes me sick &raquo;, you revealed. Maya frowned and asked &laquo; What about her thoughts? &raquo; You let a deep breath &laquo; That&rsquo;s the thing she seemed to really focus and think on how to get Rogers on her bed, but it didn&rsquo;t fell real. &raquo; Maya nodded and confirmed you that you should tell Rogers about your gut. You ended your day and head back to the compound. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You saw Wilson and Barnes on the couch and joined them. &laquo; Hey Tik and Tak, what are you watching? &raquo;, you asked amused. Barnes frowned having no idea what you just called them and Wilson gave you a small sarcastic laugh &laquo; Ha ha ha aren&rsquo;t you hilarious &raquo;, Wilson said. You smiled brightly and responded &laquo; Yeah I know that&rsquo;s actually my real talent. &raquo; They chuckled and shook their heads. You sat down with them on whatever movie they were watching when the elevator dinged. Rogers came out of it with Sharon. They were holding hands and he seemed happy. <i>&lsquo;Why is it always me to have to break that guy&rsquo;s heart?&rsquo;</i>, you thought. They shared a cheesy couple kiss and she left, battling her eyelashes. Wilson and Barnes were looking proud at Rogers and you were just suspicious.</p><p>&laquo; How was it? &raquo;, asked Barnes with a smile. Rogers shrugged and replied &laquo; It was really great. &raquo; Wilson congratulated him and so did Barnes. Rogers looked at you expecting your opinion but boy he was not ready for what came next. &laquo; I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re good again, I just don&rsquo;t think going out with her is the best thing. &raquo; He frowned at your comment, hurt. &laquo; Why not? &raquo;, he said annoyed. You stood up and walked his way, trying to say it calmly. &laquo; I don&rsquo;t know I just think you deserve better. &raquo; He chuckled dryly and started &laquo; What do you care if I deserve better or not. Are you jealous or something? &raquo;</p><p>It was your turn to chuckle &laquo; Me jealous? Why would I be jealous Rogers? &raquo;, you asked annoyed. The tension was beginning to grow and so was our mutual anger. &laquo; Oh I don&rsquo;t know that maybe someone is into me and not into you &raquo;, he spat. You laughed and declared &laquo; Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous Rogers, that&rsquo;s insane. &raquo; He frowned and clenched his jaw &laquo; Well maybe if you weren&rsquo;t such a horrible person, someone would actually want to date you. Instead you&rsquo;re there dressing like a slut and making out with some fetishist ! &raquo;, he said bitterly. Your smile vanished and you slapped him hard in the face <b><i><a href=\"http://ticklikeabomb.tumblr.com/post/175479085802/the-marvel-parody-chapter-13-pairing-in-the\" target=\"_blank\">(reference to the Marvel Parody Series, Part 13)</a></i></b>. You stormed out of the place into your room and entered inside. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to lock the door and not open it on any circumstance. </p><p>Barnes and Wilson looked shocked at Rogers behavior and he left his head fall. &laquo; Dude that wasn&rsquo;t nice &raquo;, exclaimed Wilson. &laquo; I know I just lost it &raquo;, whispered Rogers. Barnes didn&rsquo;t say anything but his disappointed look told everything his best friend needed to know. Rogers made his way to your room and knocked. &laquo; Y/N&hellip; look I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t know what came up to me. Open up. &raquo; You gave him no response. He stood in front of your room for hours but you never answered. You stayed in your room a whole week, not wanting to see anyone. Several times a day, people would knock on your door, pleading for you to get out and at least eat something but again you would never respond. </p><p>&laquo; What the fuck Steve &raquo;, yelled Romanoff at the Soldier on day 2. &laquo; I know I know. I&rsquo;m trying to apologize. &raquo; She shook her head and replied &laquo; It&rsquo;s gonna take you way more than just stand there in front of a door and just say sorry. You slut-shamed her. You of all people and she just gave you an honest opinion. If it was me saying that Sharon wasn&rsquo;t the one for you, never in the world you would act that way. You should be ashamed of yourself ! &raquo;, she told him angrily and left. Rogers felt bad and indeed ashamed of his attitude. </p><p>A week later, you got out of your room and headed to the kitchen. When you entered the conversations ended and you just took your cup of coffee. &laquo; Hey Y/N how are you? &raquo;, asked Wilson. &laquo; I&rsquo;ve never been better &raquo;, you lied. You looked at everyone except for the Soldier who you ignored. &laquo; Is there any mission on the plate today? &raquo;, you asked Stark. &laquo; Yes just reckon. I was gonna send Clint &raquo;, he answered. You nodded and said &laquo; I&rsquo;ll go with him, if it&rsquo;s ok with you &raquo;, you turned to the Archer. He gave you a small smile and nodded. You walked out and heard Rogers call for you and on the corner where he couldn&rsquo;t see you, you vanished. </p><p>The reckon was alright. With Barton you got Hydra&rsquo;s location and got their evil plan. That&rsquo;s when you saw her walk. You nodged Barton in the ribs and made him turn you way. He now was your witness - Sharon Carter in flesh and bones with the enemy. He nodded and you both joined the quinjet. &laquo; She was there &raquo;, was all he said. &laquo; Yep, I knew she was fucking shady &raquo;, was the last thing you said. During the briefing Barton told them what you&rsquo;ve found and that Sharon was there. Again Rogers didn&rsquo;t want to believe it but Barton insisted that he saw it with his own eyes and he couldn&rsquo;t deny his friends&rsquo;s sayings. </p><p>The team was suited and were about to leave when they saw you in your pjs in the couch. &laquo; What the hell are you doing? &raquo;, asked Stark. You continued to read the stupid magazine in your hands and just declared &laquo; Have fun. &raquo; Barnes stepped in front of you and kneeled &laquo; Look we know you&rsquo;re upset right now but we need you. &raquo; You looked him in the eyes and give him a cold gaze. &laquo; No you don&rsquo;t and you never did. I&rsquo;m sure you can handle this all by yourselves. I&rsquo;m not coming, I&rsquo;m just a horrible person. &raquo; He sighed and stood up giving Rogers a deadly stare. &laquo; Fine whatever let&rsquo;s go. We&rsquo;ll deal with this later &raquo;, told Stark and they left. </p><p>Three hours later, the elevators dinged and everyone came out of it. They were bruised and their suits were half destroyed. &laquo; Seems like you had fun &raquo;, you spat sarcastically. &laquo; That&rsquo;s enough. You compromised the whole team with your childish behavior &raquo;, exclaimed a furious Rogers. You ignored him and walked to Barnes. &laquo; Hey baby you alright? I missed you &raquo;, you told him and everybody looked shocked. &laquo; I&rsquo;m ok&hellip;doll missed you too. &raquo; You kissed him deeply and embraced him. You stepped out of the kiss and looked him in the eyes before whispering &laquo; You should know your targets more &raquo; and his eyes widened. You then whispered slowly so that no one else could here but only him &laquo; I&rsquo;m Nyx by the way &raquo; and you saw his horrified face. You took a hidden knife and sliced his throat. Everyone was either shocked or started screaming. Romanoff pointed a gun at your head and Rogers was kneeled in front of Barnes. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>The next thing heard in the room was the elevator. Barnes came out of it, confused of the scene in front of him. Rogers looked back at the body in front of him and saw the body transform. &laquo; It&rsquo;s a shapeshifter &raquo;, you exclaimed. Romanoff put down her gun and you continued &laquo; You really think I was dating Barnes? How couldn&rsquo;t you notice that it wasn&rsquo;t him. &raquo; No one said anything. &laquo; How? How? did you? &raquo;, stuttered Rogers. You chuckled dryly. &laquo; Barnes always has an elastic hair on his right wrist in case he wants to put them in a man-bun, his posture was different and when I embraced him his arm, well no metal. And clearly he thought we were together which we aren&rsquo;t. &raquo; Rogers stood up dumbfounded and you spat at him &laquo; I just solved this case, here in the compound, in my pjs. You&rsquo;re welcome. &raquo; You were about to leave when you turned around and declared &laquo; Your girl Sharon &raquo; and you pointed to the body, &laquo; It wasn&rsquo;t the real one, that&rsquo;s why she seemed odd to me and I told you, you deserved better. &raquo; With that said you left to your room. A few hours later, F.R.I.D.A.Y confirmed you that Stark managed to find Sharon Carter tied to a chair in another state. </p><p>It took you five months to forgive Rogers for his attitude. At the beginning you would come with them on missions and follow the instructions but as soon you were at the compound, you shut the Soldier off your life. He was desperate and did everything he could to have your forgiveness, telling you he didn&rsquo;t mean what he said, that his attitude was horrible and that he trusted you with his whole being. Five months later you forgave him and included him back in your life.&nbsp;</p><p><b>*gifs not mine, credit to owner*</b></p><p><b>TAG LIST for the SERIES</b> : <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\" target=\"_blank\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNuJ8C6EqD_67zjxrHZtBbg\" target=\"_blank\">@buckybarneslemons</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOGAtG9_S-lbjf27Nr1pLzg\" target=\"_blank\">@brennan1618</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6KjREyEM6_h8vhKV4C3FtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@alexfayer</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_elqr83Pqn0eGXSptaznaA\" target=\"_blank\">@totally-alexa21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moj7Oc2DZ2MiCZeDDg1yGAw\" target=\"_blank\">@lovesteverogersbaeworld</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRVTn1jahXLpD9Wr4-8Q1cA\" target=\"_blank\">@bulbachu13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg1Cop7_uIHrZgAe6F08DCg\" target=\"_blank\">@oliviajmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAS8e4XrbAZVnLM9Fxou_fA\" target=\"_blank\">@the-lachrymose-one</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCQXLBP-e3ar0rrwHcWggg\" target=\"_blank\">@poetic-pixie</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtwAHvrimCwB-xOdfQvTTOw\" target=\"_blank\">@kendrawr-kitkat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_ik-26PqcRnVKl0vbydvCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@5aftermidnight</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmUk-3I9DGdts5TUy6qFHg\" target=\"_blank\">@hoibetty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYzOQjgWuDGRSUGqki9A5sQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thewayilookatbacon</a> @d0nt-apologise <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnACC_JshwcEYFiYErsctjw\" target=\"_blank\">@wakandaforever11</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLcl0ZmD86Dpd16SkT0g-1w\" target=\"_blank\">@multifandom-reallyamess</a> @depressivegoblin <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO2yyIQqQnd0a3gbW8lzk2g\" target=\"_blank\">@xxleannewardxx</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3emKnPL5XbJ9iqsE-l7Imw\" target=\"_blank\">@pixiehex1985</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX7VaMOXaTcQ3PuiE8xX8Pg\" target=\"_blank\">@kittyjs123</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\" target=\"_blank\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r0Z83vxCNxu61ii2DIi6w\" target=\"_blank\">@gaylemonshark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moffUH_LgH-mYCzwxiG99Aw\" target=\"_blank\">@ludmi0u0</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mytAUV2gKaOrbNnxgzTtYfQ\" target=\"_blank\">@missphoenix69</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAFfKJc5cRm1VdTDpK4e3FQ\" target=\"_blank\">@marshmallow-witch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkUlU4PeTjZAC7DVI1SQA2Q\" target=\"_blank\">@everydayisonfire</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-wGk15bGrCJhe6BHElm90A\" target=\"_blank\">@papayapagan</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjt_GfGRXLxFyH2LIuNfPtQ\" target=\"_blank\">@llfuture-disney-princessll-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvzqK2EH3rTaVFiMK8NJ9gA\" target=\"_blank\">@clockworkmorningglory</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmvRpuSWzlyumW0TxBEvYGg\" target=\"_blank\">@angieptt</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSybi4jvI05dGI64klKbnuQ\" target=\"_blank\">@shockwavee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\" target=\"_blank\">@lilulo-12</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\" target=\"_blank\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqtrCF2Zs3_quWSX4dAyiJw\" target=\"_blank\">@ismeewhores</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw12zrVmzmGtZLdQ-0rIYTA\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfictionrecommendations-com</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7rXAgLvNHsSUkb8lGnyeg\" target=\"_blank\">@wildsoul1221</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVFWgbxy6uE7nyh7nrquQPw\" target=\"_blank\">@prettybubblesintheair</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muIMbGBGHBRBSh_vW3WaBYg\" target=\"_blank\">@wayward-timetravel-collecter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yiskJOcz7k_nOLRaHq7iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@lokithedancingqueen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6e0nhW809mI7ErYzKY-7ag\" target=\"_blank\">@francezka10</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muanS215gWWOGywv2cvjZuA\" target=\"_blank\">@tnupsweetpie</a></p></p>",

But the first part contains a few lines I read and think,\u00a0\u201cDang, I did good,\u201d so that\u2019s nice.</p><p>As always, feedback is super appreciated!</p><p>Many thanks to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxu6zPm7j0A8sEf03xcnR9w\">@unwrapping</a> for having a post on how to use the\u00a0\u201ckeep reading\u201d feature. Yay, I can use that now!</p><p><b>Word count:</b>\u00a01514</p><p><b>Warnings:</b>\u00a0That action sequence at the end (bad writing and angst), references to adults doing things that make me wish my mom didn\u2019t read these (she does. *sigh*)</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You landed hard on your back and for a moment you couldn\u2019t\nbreathe. Natasha grinned down at you in victory.</p><p>\u201cAnd I win again. Really, Y/N, I expected you to be better\nat this after a week of training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call this training?\u201d You groaned as you pushed yourself\ninto a sitting position. \u201cIt\u2019s just you showing me a move or two before\nknocking me on my ass for two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, you are improving,\u201d Nat assured you as\nshe grabbed your hand and hauled you to your feet. </p><p>\u201cThen why have I never been this sore before in my life?\u201d\nYou rubbed your back, wincing as you hit what had to be a pretty big bruise.\n\u201cIt keeps compounding. I thought yesterday was bad, but today is definitely\nworse.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll thank me for it the first time you have to work\nthrough pain on a mission.\u201d</p><p>You glared at the pretty Russian. \u201cI\u2019m not joining the team,\nNat. I\u2019m just supposed to be learning how to defend myself.\u201d</p><p>She waved off your protest. \u201cThen you\u2019ll thank me when you\nhave to work through pain when fighting for your life. Until you can at least\nhold your own against me, we\u2019ll keep working. Let\u2019s run it one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Steve back,\u201d you complained.</p><p>\u201cAsk and you shall receive.\u201d</p><p>You whirled around to face the voice behind you, only to\nhave Natasha flip you once again. The floor rushing up to meet you knocked the\nbreath out of your lungs and you swore you saw Jesus.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Nat!\u201d you gasped out.</p><p>\u201cYou were distracted,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I was distracted, my boyfriend\u2019s back!\u201d</p><p>Steve ducked into the ring and glanced at Natasha before\nsmiling down at you. </p><p>\u201cHard at work, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you whined, \u201cNat is being mean to me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and held out a hand for you to grab. You shook\nyour head.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just stay down here for a while. Less distance\nto fall.\u201d</p><p>Clint and Bucky wandered into the gym and saw you on your\nback.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone\u2019s been training with Nat,\u201d Clint teased.\n\u201cHow many times has she beaten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred and fifty-two times. Forty eight of those were\ntoday.\u201d</p><p>He cracked up. \u201cYou\u2019ve been counting?\u201d</p><p>You sighed, sitting up and crossing your legs. \u201cOf course\nI\u2019ve been counting. I get a new bruise each time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s test you out,\u201d Steve said, again holding out his hand\nto pull you up. You reluctantly acquiesced. </p><p>\u201cFine, but I want to fight Clint this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I can hold my own against Nat,\u201d Clint\nobjected indignantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd she beats you every time,\u201d Bucky teased, elbowing him\nin the ribs. \u201cFight the woman.\u201d</p><p>Clint assented and joined you as Steve and Natasha vacated\nthe ring.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, Y/N,\u201d Nat assured you from the ropes.\n\u201cJust remember what we\u2019ve worked on.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Clint wasn\u2019t expecting you to be able to hold your own\nor maybe you really were getting better. For whatever reason, you found\nyourself reacting automatically to his attacks, and soon he was the one to hit\nthe floor. You turned to your cheering fans to bow and he swept out a leg,\nknocking you down next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about getting distracted?\u201d Nat laughed\nas you sat up and shoved Clint.</p><p>\u201cLow blow, Barton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut totally worth the look on your face,\u201d he joked. \u201cNext\ntime I\u2019ll take you down first and you can land the belated attempt to save\nface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time will have to be another day,\u201d you announced as\nyou got up. \u201cI get to go back to work today, and I definitely need a shower\nbefore I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean up and go with you.\u201d Steve picked up his duffle.</p><p>\u201cNo, you,\u201d you ordered, poking him in the chest, \u201care going\nto shower after I do, followed by food or whatever you need to be ready for\nwhen I get back. Tony is going with me.\u201d You stood on your tiptoes and\nwhispered in his ear, \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone a week. I\u2019m jumping you as soon as I\u2019m\noff work. I want you wide awake.\u201d With a sly grin, you stalked off to take your\nshower.</p><p>\u201cWell, something\u2019s got the Captain blushing,\u201d Bucky teased\nas he and Clint followed your exit, headed to their rooms.</p><p>Natasha came up and stood beside Steve, watching you retreat\nacross the gym. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a special one there, Cap. Don\u2019t let her get away.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded, the scarlet slowly leaving his cheeks.\n\u201cBelieve me, I fully intend to keep her.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., tell Happy to bring the car around in fifteen\nminutes. I want him waiting by the curb when we step out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony sipped his coffee and continued to pretend to read. He\nhad tapped into the shop\u2019s security system and was viewing all the camera feeds\non a screen carefully built into his fake newspaper. Your shift had gone\nsmoothly so far, but it was almost 4 p.m. and that meant you were about to\nenter the most vulnerable part of your time outside the tower: travelling.</p><p>Happy pulled up just as you came out of the back with your\npurse. You nodded at Tony and he stood, taking your arm. You were both on high\nalert as he opened the door and you slid in.</p><p>\u201cGive us a different route than the one we took to get\nhere,\u201d Tony called up to Happy as he slid in behind you and shut the door.\n\u201cMake it unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>Happy nodded at him in the rear-view mirror and pulled away\nfrom the curb. He hadn\u2019t even fully entered the flow of traffic when you heard\na small thud from the roof.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., what just landed?\u201d Tony asked, his armor\nstarting to form around him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s some sort of device. I\u2019m scanning it but I\u2019ve never\nseen anything like it before. I have no idea what it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Happy, pull over! We\u2019re going on foot. Ditch the\ncar just in case but wait nearby for backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve alerted the team,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed you both. \u201cA\nquinjet is en route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it on, Y/N. We\u2019re going out.\u201d Tony stepped out of the\ncar and shielded you with himself, scanning the entire area and taking a quick\nlook at the disc attached to the roof of the SUV.</p><p>You reached into your purse and pulled out a metal triangle\nthat Tony had given you. When you pressed it against your chest it spread out,\nenveloping you in some sort of armor.

We\u2019re going out.\u201d Tony stepped out of the\ncar and shielded you with himself, scanning the entire area and taking a quick\nlook at the disc attached to the roof of the SUV.</p><p>You reached into your purse and pulled out a metal triangle\nthat Tony had given you. When you pressed it against your chest it spread out,\nenveloping you in some sort of armor.

Don\u2019t let her get away.\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded, the scarlet slowly leaving his cheeks.\n\u201cBelieve me, I fully intend to keep her.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., tell Happy to bring the car around in fifteen\nminutes. I want him waiting by the curb when we step out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Tony sipped his coffee and continued to pretend to read. He\nhad tapped into the shop\u2019s security system and was viewing all the camera feeds\non a screen carefully built into his fake newspaper. Your shift had gone\nsmoothly so far, but it was almost 4 p.m. and that meant you were about to\nenter the most vulnerable part of your time outside the tower: travelling.</p><p>Happy pulled up just as you came out of the back with your\npurse. You nodded at Tony and he stood, taking your arm. You were both on high\nalert as he opened the door and you slid in.</p><p>\u201cGive us a different route than the one we took to get\nhere,\u201d Tony called up to Happy as he slid in behind you and shut the door.\n\u201cMake it unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>Happy nodded at him in the rear-view mirror and pulled away\nfrom the curb. He hadn\u2019t even fully entered the flow of traffic when you heard\na small thud from the roof.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., what just landed?\u201d Tony asked, his armor\nstarting to form around him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s some sort of device. I\u2019m scanning it but I\u2019ve never\nseen anything like it before. I have no idea what it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Happy, pull over! We\u2019re going on foot. Ditch the\ncar just in case but wait nearby for backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve alerted the team,\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed you both. \u201cA\nquinjet is en route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it on, Y/N. We\u2019re going out.\u201d Tony stepped out of the\ncar and shielded you with himself, scanning the entire area and taking a quick\nlook at the disc attached to the roof of the SUV.</p><p>You reached into your purse and pulled out a metal triangle\nthat Tony had given you. When you pressed it against your chest it spread out,\nenveloping you in some sort of armor. Tony pulled you out behind him and\ndragged you to an alley nearby.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d you breathed nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou are staying behind me and up against this wall,\u201d Tony\ninformed you tersely, his voice sounding metallic through his mask. \u201cI am\nstanding between you and the rest of the world until the quinjet arrives and\nyou\u2019re safe with Cap.\u201d</p><p>Three men slipped from the shadows and attacked. While Tony\nfended them off, you felt yourself being jerked upward. Another attacker had\nrepelled down the building and grabbed you from behind.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d you cried out before a hand clamped over your mouth.\nHe looked up and saw you as snipers began shooting from the roof behind you. He\nleft the men below and dodged the bullets on his way up.</p><p>You were on the roof now and had more space to maneuver. You\nmanaged to shake off the man holding you, but two more were waiting and they\nattacked as soon as you were free. You had never tried to fend off multiple\nattackers before, and found yourself quickly failing.</p><p>Tony landed and began fighting off the others who joined\nyour attackers, but he couldn\u2019t blast at them without fear of hitting you. You\nfelt a rising panic as a helicopter flew up and hovered low over where you were\nfighting. The quinjet was nowhere in sight.</p><p>Arms grabbed you and pinned your hands behind your back,\ndragging you towards a ladder lowering from the helicopter. You couldn\u2019t fight,\nbut you refused to be taken again.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d you yelled, ripping yourself from their arms. At your\nburst of emotion, a wave of energy pulsed from your body. Tony\u2019s armor went\ndark and the helicopter lost power, crashing down the side of the building and\ninto the street below. The energy knocked your attackers back, and before they\ncould regain their footing a shield flew from behind you and knocked three of\nthem out.</p><p>Steve was here, followed by Clint and Bucky. Nat held the quinjet\nin a hover above you and lowered a rope, which you caught so she could pull you\nup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting you out of here,\u201d she called to you as she\npulled the jet around. \u201cThe others will clean up.\u201d</p><p>You looked out the window of the jet, worry curling in your\nstomach as you watched Steve fight through the HYDRA agents. As he shrank in\nthe distance, you prayed he would be all right.</p>",

The floor rushing up to meet you knocked the\nbreath out of your lungs and you swore you saw Jesus.</p><p>&ldquo;Damnit, Nat!&rdquo; you gasped out.</p><p>&ldquo;You were distracted,&rdquo; she smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I was distracted, my boyfriend&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve ducked into the ring and glanced at Natasha before\nsmiling down at you. </p><p>&ldquo;Hard at work, I see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; you whined, &ldquo;Nat is being mean to me.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed and held out a hand for you to grab.
