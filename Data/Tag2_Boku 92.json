        "answer": "<p><b>BET SAY LESS</b></p><h2>Todoroki</h2><p>\u2764\ufe0fY\u2019all (soz guys im from Texas) are the type of couple that people didn\u2019t even know were a couple. Yeah you were one of the few people he talked to on a regular basis, but it still shocked everyone when he leaned over to kiss your cheek. Since when were you dating??</p><p>\ud83d\udc99There are times where he doesn\u2019t speak, and uses certain actions and gestures instead. When he\u2019s proud of you, he\u2019d give you a soft kiss on the forehead. When he wants to hold you and cuddle, he\u2019d squeeze your waist two times, indicating that he wants you to sit in his lap. When he wants to rant about something, he\u2019d lay his head on your lap before getting ready to talk, talk, and talk. Those times are probably the most he does.</p><p>\u2764\ufe0f<strike>Makes you eat soba with him</strike> Eats soba with you like it\u2019s required for your everyday lives. Like it\u2019s some type of mandatory task. You\u2019d be willing to get something else to eat and he\u2019d just say \u201cWe haven\u2019t had soba since last week.\u201d With the most convincing pout he could put on his face. One time when you didn\u2019t get soba, he was actually pretty sad. He said it was okay, but it seemed like every bite of pizza he took brought him closer to just <i>sobbing</i>. His face didn\u2019t show it, but his eyes did.</p><p>\ud83d\udc99When he texts you, every message has proper grammar. No abbreviations, no slang, nothing. From the start, this boy has never seen a meme or vine in his life. You would throw a vine reference at him, maybe, \u201cWhat up, I\u2019m Jared, I\u2019m 19, and I never freaking learned how to read,\u201d and he\u2019d be genuinely confused. \u201cYou\u2019re not Jared. You\u2019re my girlfriend.\u201d Now he understands memes and vines, and would even try to reference them himself. It\u2019s adorable when he tries. One time when you sent him a meme, he wanted you to send pictures of yourself instead. He likes memes, but he loves you.</p><!-- more --><h2>Shinso</h2><p>\ud83d\udc9cY\u2019all are the type of couple that most people would deem the perfect couple. It\u2019s a mystery why people think that, but when the two of you are seen doing something together, someone would most likely say \u201ccouple goals!!\u201d</p><p>\ud83d\udc9cYou want to mess around, get loud, and reference memes? No problem. Shinsou could do that with you all day. However, do expect sleepy cuddles at the end of it all. It\u2019s fun but tiring.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9cLikes taking pictures of you. Whether you\u2019re just waking up, with your hair all over your head, or you\u2019re dressed up for an occasion, this boy takes a lot of pictures in many different angles. One time he even took a photo of you from the top of the cabinet before jumping down and practically scaring the life out of you. What the heck was he doing all the way up there??</p><p>\ud83d\udc9cLoves when you play in his hair. Just patting it, combing your fingers through it, even lightly scratching his scalp. Before the two of you started dating, his hair would normally get a bit greasy before he decided to wash it. Now he washes it on a set schedule so it would never be greasy. \u201cYou\u2019re hands are precious and I want my hair to be in good condition for them.\u201d He explained to you one time. He\u2019s also a nuzzler. Call it what you want, but whenever you guys cuddle, he\u2019d nuzzle his nose into your neck, and would let out this content sigh, similar to a cat\u2019s purr.</p><h2>Kaminari </h2><p>\ud83d\udc9bY\u2019all are the type of couple who EVERYONE knows is a couple. Whether it\u2019s because you both show each other off, or because Kaminari shows you off. I\u2019m talking tons of pictures of you on social media. Screenshots of text messages between the two of you. Heck, he even mentions your name at least once in every conversation he has with his friends. It\u2019s not necessarily showing off, it\u2019s more of him expressing his happiness. And you just happen to be the source.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9bPDA is something you\u2019d be all too familiar with, but it\u2019s kept to a minimum. Because of this, Kaminari is twice as affectionate in private. PDA consists of things like cheek kisses and hand holding. But behind closed doors, he\u2019s like a baby koala clinging onto its mother. </p><p>\ud83d\udc9bHe isn\u2019t worried about your relationship. But one thing he does worry about sometimes is if you ever think he\u2019s too dumb for you. Not only does he have some of the lowest grades in class 1-A, but he\u2019s also a complete fool when he short circuits his brain. The first time you had to take care of him in his foolish state, he was deeply embarrassed afterwards when you started talking about the things he did. What made him embarrassed the most is what you told him about him touching all over you. He may be mildly perverted, but he truly loved you and respected you to an extent. It\u2019s true he clings to you like a koala, but he wouldn\u2019t let his hands roam freely without your consent. For the remainder of that day, he apologized a lot and was afraid to touch you in any way.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9bOn a lighter note: Memes and vines to the max. This dude has them all.</p><h2>Midoriya</h2><p>\ud83d\udc9aY\u2019all are the type of couple no one entirely expected to be a couple. How did Midoriya get a girlfriend as easy as it is for him to get flustered? Not to mention super clumsy. Yes, you were shy as well, but Midoriya\u2019s shyness is a distinct shyness. However, everyone thought you guys were adorable together nonetheless.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9aThings seemed a little too serious at the beginning of the relationship. Of course a relationship is supposed to be serious, but not serious to the point every moment in the relationship has to be about Midoriya proving to you how much of a man he is. This poor boy wasn\u2019t feeling too confident about what you thought of him as your boyfriend. He was worried you thought he was a wimp, or any other of the countless, negative words that came to his mind. Not to worry though, as this battle was fought and won when the two of you sat down and talked about it. After that talk, it was evident that his confidence went up. Relationship wise.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9aHe\u2019s always talking about you to his mom. She probably loves you just as much as he does! It\u2019s so refreshing to his mom that Izu chose the perfect girl to have in his life. If you didn\u2019t already have parents, she would\u2019ve considered adopting you\u2014which is a little strange but uH we love Inko very much. </p><p>\ud83d\udc9aHe\u2019d probably never say this, but he loves laying on your chest <strike>because it\u2019s squishy</strike> because he can hear your heartbeat, which soothes him. But he doesn\u2019t really have to say it. It\u2019s obvious he likes laying on your chest, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t do it almost every time you cuddle.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Posted 3.28.19 18:37</p>",

It\u2019s a mystery why people think that, but when the two of you are seen doing something together, someone would most likely say \u201ccouple goals!!\u201d</p><p>\ud83d\udc9cYou want to mess around, get loud, and reference memes? No problem. Shinsou could do that with you all day. However, do expect sleepy cuddles at the end of it all. It\u2019s fun but tiring.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9cLikes taking pictures of you. Whether you\u2019re just waking up, with your hair all over your head, or you\u2019re dressed up for an occasion, this boy takes a lot of pictures in many different angles. One time he even took a photo of you from the top of the cabinet before jumping down and practically scaring the life out of you. What the heck was he doing all the way up there??</p><p>\ud83d\udc9cLoves when you play in his hair. Just patting it, combing your fingers through it, even lightly scratching his scalp. Before the two of you started dating, his hair would normally get a bit greasy before he decided to wash it. Now he washes it on a set schedule so it would never be greasy. \u201cYou\u2019re hands are precious and I want my hair to be in good condition for them.\u201d He explained to you one time. He\u2019s also a nuzzler. Call it what you want, but whenever you guys cuddle, he\u2019d nuzzle his nose into your neck, and would let out this content sigh, similar to a cat\u2019s purr.</p><h2>Kaminari </h2><p>\ud83d\udc9bY\u2019all are the type of couple who EVERYONE knows is a couple. Whether it\u2019s because you both show each other off, or because Kaminari shows you off. I\u2019m talking tons of pictures of you on social media. Screenshots of text messages between the two of you. Heck, he even mentions your name at least once in every conversation he has with his friends. It\u2019s not necessarily showing off, it\u2019s more of him expressing his happiness. And you just happen to be the source.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9bPDA is something you\u2019d be all too familiar with, but it\u2019s kept to a minimum. Because of this, Kaminari is twice as affectionate in private. PDA consists of things like cheek kisses and hand holding. But behind closed doors, he\u2019s like a baby koala clinging onto its mother. </p><p>\ud83d\udc9bHe isn\u2019t worried about your relationship. But one thing he does worry about sometimes is if you ever think he\u2019s too dumb for you. Not only does he have some of the lowest grades in class 1-A, but he\u2019s also a complete fool when he short circuits his brain. The first time you had to take care of him in his foolish state, he was deeply embarrassed afterwards when you started talking about the things he did. What made him embarrassed the most is what you told him about him touching all over you. He may be mildly perverted, but he truly loved you and respected you to an extent. It\u2019s true he clings to you like a koala, but he wouldn\u2019t let his hands roam freely without your consent. For the remainder of that day, he apologized a lot and was afraid to touch you in any way.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9bOn a lighter note: Memes and vines to the max. This dude has them all.</p><h2>Midoriya</h2><p>\ud83d\udc9aY\u2019all are the type of couple no one entirely expected to be a couple. How did Midoriya get a girlfriend as easy as it is for him to get flustered? Not to mention super clumsy. Yes, you were shy as well, but Midoriya\u2019s shyness is a distinct shyness. However, everyone thought you guys were adorable together nonetheless.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9aThings seemed a little too serious at the beginning of the relationship. Of course a relationship is supposed to be serious, but not serious to the point every moment in the relationship has to be about Midoriya proving to you how much of a man he is. This poor boy wasn\u2019t feeling too confident about what you thought of him as your boyfriend. He was worried you thought he was a wimp, or any other of the countless, negative words that came to his mind. Not to worry though, as this battle was fought and won when the two of you sat down and talked about it. After that talk, it was evident that his confidence went up. Relationship wise.</p><p>\ud83d\udc9aHe\u2019s always talking about you to his mom. She probably loves you just as much as he does!

ALSO, he was perfectly fine with both killing, and later kidnapping literal teenagers. his kill list seems to consist of midoriya and todoroki so far, and he kidnapped bakugou\u2014and here\u2019s a reminder that he treated bakugou more like a business partner rather than a teenager. he even goes so far as to call him a <i>new recruit!</i> and when bakugou showed that he wasn\u2019t going to come willingly? he asked AfO for his power\u2014he was going to strip bakugou of his free will and make him join the LOV whether he wanted to or not.</p><p>what i\u2019m trying to say is that he probably sees how he was raised (read: groomed) as <i>normal</i>, and if he ever happened to take in a child that was in the same vulnerable position as he was, he might continue the cycle of abuse. he needs to care for himself properly before he thinks about caring for another <i>still-developing human being!</i> he needs to recover, people! to learn, and heal, and grow.</p><p>yes, shigaraki is an abuse survivor\u2014and i think he\u2019s a good portrayal of one, at that. at the same time, this fact doesn\u2019t mean he is a good representation of an abuse survivor that is <i>healing</i>. i know that traumatized people will project their trauma into fiction\u2014i am a traumatized person, and i cope like this too! when people project their trauma into fiction, they need to be conscious and mindful of how and where they do it. whether or not they cope publicly is one thing, and if they do choose to cope publicly, they need to know who their audience will be.</p><p>moving on! why is raising a child is the perfect sign of someone being healthy enough to pass as normal? is there something wrong with people that don\u2019t want children? American society seems to think so, at least\u2014whenever i tell my mother that i don\u2019t want a child (specifically because of my traumas and mental illnesses, and my worries that i will end up being a bad parent and traumatizing my future child), she tells me that i am making her very sad, or that i still have time to grow and change that idea, or anything else that insinuates that she doesn\u2019t accept this fact. suggesting that shigaraki should, or even <i>could</i> take care of a child and put them in a healthy, safe environment in the current situation that he\u2019s in makes me think that you need to reevaluate your personal values and views on abuse victims.</p><p>not being made to deal with children is not an inherent flaw, and it\u2019s not something anyone needs to change. some people just aren\u2019t built to take care of children, like me and shigaraki! it doesn\u2019t mean that they dislike children, or don\u2019t care for them\u2014in fact, i personally care about children a lot! it\u2019s just a matter of putting the child first, and wanting them to be in a safer, <i>healthier</i> environment, with a competent caretaker. the fact of the matter is that shigaraki, right now? is not a competent caretaker, and wouldn\u2019t be able to provide the child with the stability and enrichment they need while developing.</p><p>all in all, don\u2019t force children on abuse survivors. taking care of a child isn\u2019t proof that someone is \u201cbetter,\u201d or \u201chealthy,\u201d or any of that. thank you for reading down this far akjfdhsf</p>",

You had\ntried to be patient with them, but there was only so much that you could take,\nespecially when your walls were currently rattling so hard that all of your\nhanging picture frames and decorations had fallen off of them. You didn\u2019t know\nwhy your neighbors were blaring their music so loudly, but it was about time\nfor them to stop. You and Sero had a charity event to attend after he got home\nfrom patrolling, and you really didn\u2019t need that kind of background music distracting\nyou while you were getting ready. </p><p>As the saying goes, you\ncatch more flies with honey than vinegar, so in what was supposed to be a\ngesture of goodwill towards your neighbors, you filled up a cookie tin with\nsome treats that you had made earlier. After that, you then made your way over\nto the apartment that was adjacent to yours, whose door was still somehow miraculously\nhanging on even though it looked like it was literally vibrating because of the\nloud music playing behind it. With a deep, calming breath to help you center\nyourself, you plastered the sweetest grin that you could across your face and\nthen rapped your knuckles against the door. </p><p>Based on the way that the\nmusic didn\u2019t stop, you assumed that they hadn\u2019t heard you, so you knocked again,\nslightly harder this time. Still no reply or pause in the music. You had to\nknock five more times before the music finally lowered (although it wasn\u2019t by\nmuch), and, seeing as you kept increasing your strength with each consecutive\nknock, there were now some nice knuckle-shaped dents on the front of the door.\nYour levels of irritation had increased dramatically in the minutes that it\ntook you to get your neighbors\u2019 attention, but you still kept the smile on your\nface, knowing that Sero would have wanted you to keep this civil. </p><p>Of course, when your\nscowling neighbors finally showed up at the door, yanking it open with a fury\nthat you knew was unjustified, you realized that civility might not be have\nbeen on option in the first place. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t seen your\nneighbors much beforehand; they were relatively new to the apartment complex,\nand you could see now that they were a relatively young couple, probably about\nthe same age as you and Sero. Maybe in another life you could have been friends\nwith them, but as it was currently, they were going to be lucky if they didn\u2019t\nend up getting the same treatment as their door. </p><p>\u201cHi! I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met\nyet, but I\u2019m your next-door neighbor! It\u2019s nice to finally meet you, and I\nbrought you some treats as a welcoming gift!\u201d</p><p>It physically pained you to\nkeep your voice so steady while you greeted them, but you were hoping that the\nsight of a small, gentle-spoken woman would make them lighten up a bit. It\ndidn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cRight, whatever. Are you\njust here to fuck around or do you actually have something important to say?\u201d </p><p>Maybe if rage hadn\u2019t been\nboiling through your veins, you would have noticed your grip on the cookie tin\ntightening, but that was obviously not the case as your smile took on a much more\nmanic quality. </p><p>\u201cWell, actually, your music\nis a little loud, and I was wondering if you could turn it down a bit.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, your neighbors\ndidn\u2019t hear the sound of bending metal, either.</p><p>\u201cFat chance of that,\nShortstack. Leave us the hell alone.\u201d </p><p>They slammed the door right\nin your face, which was definitely not a good idea considering that it was the\nfinal straw that made you drop all sense of propriety. The next thing that your\nneighbors knew, their door had been ripped right off of its hinges and there\nwas crushed cookie tin whirling its way into their apartment. They both paled\nas they looked back to where the door should have been, your tiny form looking\nmuch more terrifying than it had earlier, the chilling look on your face enough\nto let them know that they should have acted just a bit more politely. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna need you to turn\nthat shit off.\u201d</p><p>When they didn\u2019t move\n(which, in hindsight, was probably because they were terrified), you decided to\nhelp them out by ridding them of whatever music system that they had. However,\nas you stepped foot into their apartment, a familiar set of arms wrapped\nthemselves around your waist, and you felt yourself being lifted up before you\nwere carried away from the scene. </p><p>\u201cSorry about that! I\u2019ll take\ncare of the door later!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDamn it, Hanta! Let me at\nthose rude fuckers!\u201d </p><p>He did not let you at those\nrude fuckers, unfortunately, and before you could try to convince him to let\nyou go, he had you back inside your own apartment. He stood between you and the\ndoor in an effort to make sure that you didn\u2019t go back to the other apartment. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>The way that he breathed\nyour name, coupled with the soft grin that he gave you, made you turn your head\naway in embarrassment as a light blush crossed your cheeks. It was an unfair\npower that he had over you, that gorgeous smile of his able to quell your anger\nwithin seconds. It made you embarrassed over how quickly you had lost your\ntemper, and while you would admit that ripping a door off its hinges may have\nbeen a bit of an overreaction, those jerks really did deserve to have some fear\nput in them. </p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to blame you,\nthough, and that smile of his never left as he leaned down to press his face\nagainst your neck. His hands also went to rest on your hips, and the apartment\nwas quiet as Sero took a moment to breathe in your scent before placing a light\nkiss at the juncture of your neck and shoulder. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie, I kind of\nfigured this would happen. I ran into them a few weeks ago, and I just knew it\nwas only a matter of time before their attitudes got them in trouble with you.\nI didn\u2019t expect you to tear their door down, though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, are you still mad,\nY/N?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMm, that\u2019s alright.\u201d </p><p>Sero followed his statement\nwith a few more hot kisses to your neck, lingering with them for a moment to\nmake sure that they gave you chills. His hands also started to wonder, moving\nto caress your thighs as they were exposed by the dress that you were wearing. </p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have you mad while\nyou\u2019re at the charity, now can we? I guess I\u2019ll have to take care of you.\u201d </p><p>He briefly pulled away from\nyou to check the time on his phone, making a disappointed \u2018tsk\u2019 when he saw how\nlate it was. </p><p>\u201cHm, we don\u2019t have a lot of\ntime, though\u2026Well, I can work with it.\u201d </p><p>Before you could question\nwhat he was talking about, Sero dipped back down, this time pressing his lips\nagainst your own. It was such a gentle kiss, but it was still enough to keep\nyou distracted as Sero took both of your arms, holding them above your head and\nspinning you around until you were pressed against the wall. His hold on you\nmomentarily disappeared, but then you heard the ripping of tape, and as Sero\nfinally ended the tender kiss, he taped your hands against the wall. </p><p>\u201cKeep these here for me,\nalright?\u201d </p><p>You couldn\u2019t even properly\nreply to him before his lips were working against yours again, still gentle in\ntheir movements, matching perfectly to the light trailing of his fingers\nagainst your inner thigh. That tender touch climbed higher and higher, until\nSero\u2019s hand finally reached your clothed mound and he stroked you along the\noutside of your underwear. </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let people\nlike that get to you, you know?\u201d</p><p>As Sero slid his hand into\nyour panties, he moved his head back to your shoulder, leaning it there and\nturning his face towards your neck so that you could practically feel his words\nagainst your skin. He teased you for a moment, barely tracing his fingers\nagainst your outer labia as you tensed up with anticipation. </p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve your\ntime or effort.\u201d</p><p>He finally pressed further\ninto you, humming at the warm slickness that his fingers met before he\ncontinued to caress your womanhood. </p><p>\u201cHanta, please just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. I told you that I\u2019d\ntake care of you, right? Just be a little patient.\u201d </p><p>His touch against you was\nsoothing in nature, but it did little to actually calm you. You needed more\nfrom him, and you tried to buck your hips against his hand to get the friction\nthat you craved, but you could only move so far since you were pinned against\nthe wall. You could feel his smile get bigger against your neck, and he finally\nbrought his fingers up to your clit, lightly circling them over the engorged\nbud and causing you to gasp. </p><p>\u201cSee? All you had to do was\ntrust me.\u201d </p><p>You almost groaned when he\ntook his fingers away from you, but before you could get the noise out, he was\nsliding two of his long digits into your waiting entrance, his thumb moving to\npress against your clit. You did end up groaning after that, but it was sound\nof relief instead of frustration. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so amazing, Y/N. You\nhave so much strength hidden in that beautiful body of yours, and it never\nfails to amaze me.\u201d </p><p>You couldn\u2019t reply to him,\nnot through the moan that you let out when he started to pump his fingers in\nand out of you, ever so slightly curling them forward so they could pass over\nthat sweet spot inside of you. He was also putting his thumb to work, slowly\nworking it around your clit as your legs started to tremble from all of the\nstimulation. </p><p>\u201cI feel so lucky to have\nyou, to see you smile every day, to kiss you, to touch you, to make you feel this\ngood.\u201d</p><p>His words only fueled the\nfire that was growing in your belly, and your body grew taut as your climax\ncrept closer and closer to fruition. You couldn\u2019t help but chant his name like\na prayer as he continued to work you, the last verse being shouted as your\norgasm burned through your body. Your hips stuttered against your lover\u2019s hand,\nand he pulled it away from you as you started to whimper from his overbearing\ntouch, settling to just stroke your outer folds again as you finally started to\nrelax. Once your breathing evened out, he pulled his hand away from you\ncompletely, and moved to where he was leaning his forehead against yours. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. We still have\na few minutes to clean up before we have to head out, if you still want to go.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cKind of hard to skip out on\na charity. I just need a minute. And Hanta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time, babe.\u201d </p>",

You had\ntried to be patient with them, but there was only so much that you could take,\nespecially when your walls were currently rattling so hard that all of your\nhanging picture frames and decorations had fallen off of them. You didn\u2019t know\nwhy your neighbors were blaring their music so loudly, but it was about time\nfor them to stop. You and Sero had a charity event to attend after he got home\nfrom patrolling, and you really didn\u2019t need that kind of background music distracting\nyou while you were getting ready. </p><p>As the saying goes, you\ncatch more flies with honey than vinegar, so in what was supposed to be a\ngesture of goodwill towards your neighbors, you filled up a cookie tin with\nsome treats that you had made earlier. After that, you then made your way over\nto the apartment that was adjacent to yours, whose door was still somehow miraculously\nhanging on even though it looked like it was literally vibrating because of the\nloud music playing behind it. With a deep, calming breath to help you center\nyourself, you plastered the sweetest grin that you could across your face and\nthen rapped your knuckles against the door. </p><p>Based on the way that the\nmusic didn\u2019t stop, you assumed that they hadn\u2019t heard you, so you knocked again,\nslightly harder this time. Still no reply or pause in the music. You had to\nknock five more times before the music finally lowered (although it wasn\u2019t by\nmuch), and, seeing as you kept increasing your strength with each consecutive\nknock, there were now some nice knuckle-shaped dents on the front of the door.\nYour levels of irritation had increased dramatically in the minutes that it\ntook you to get your neighbors\u2019 attention, but you still kept the smile on your\nface, knowing that Sero would have wanted you to keep this civil. </p><p>Of course, when your\nscowling neighbors finally showed up at the door, yanking it open with a fury\nthat you knew was unjustified, you realized that civility might not be have\nbeen on option in the first place. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t seen your\nneighbors much beforehand; they were relatively new to the apartment complex,\nand you could see now that they were a relatively young couple, probably about\nthe same age as you and Sero. Maybe in another life you could have been friends\nwith them, but as it was currently, they were going to be lucky if they didn\u2019t\nend up getting the same treatment as their door. </p><p>\u201cHi! I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met\nyet, but I\u2019m your next-door neighbor! It\u2019s nice to finally meet you, and I\nbrought you some treats as a welcoming gift!\u201d</p><p>It physically pained you to\nkeep your voice so steady while you greeted them, but you were hoping that the\nsight of a small, gentle-spoken woman would make them lighten up a bit. It\ndidn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cRight, whatever. Are you\njust here to fuck around or do you actually have something important to say?\u201d </p><p>Maybe if rage hadn\u2019t been\nboiling through your veins, you would have noticed your grip on the cookie tin\ntightening, but that was obviously not the case as your smile took on a much more\nmanic quality. </p><p>\u201cWell, actually, your music\nis a little loud, and I was wondering if you could turn it down a bit.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, your neighbors\ndidn\u2019t hear the sound of bending metal, either.</p><p>\u201cFat chance of that,\nShortstack. Leave us the hell alone.\u201d </p><p>They slammed the door right\nin your face, which was definitely not a good idea considering that it was the\nfinal straw that made you drop all sense of propriety. The next thing that your\nneighbors knew, their door had been ripped right off of its hinges and there\nwas crushed cookie tin whirling its way into their apartment. They both paled\nas they looked back to where the door should have been, your tiny form looking\nmuch more terrifying than it had earlier, the chilling look on your face enough\nto let them know that they should have acted just a bit more politely. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna need you to turn\nthat shit off.\u201d</p><p>When they didn\u2019t move\n(which, in hindsight, was probably because they were terrified), you decided to\nhelp them out by ridding them of whatever music system that they had. However,\nas you stepped foot into their apartment, a familiar set of arms wrapped\nthemselves around your waist, and you felt yourself being lifted up before you\nwere carried away from the scene. </p><p>\u201cSorry about that! I\u2019ll take\ncare of the door later!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDamn it, Hanta! Let me at\nthose rude fuckers!\u201d </p><p>He did not let you at those\nrude fuckers, unfortunately, and before you could try to convince him to let\nyou go, he had you back inside your own apartment. He stood between you and the\ndoor in an effort to make sure that you didn\u2019t go back to the other apartment. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>The way that he breathed\nyour name, coupled with the soft grin that he gave you, made you turn your head\naway in embarrassment as a light blush crossed your cheeks. It was an unfair\npower that he had over you, that gorgeous smile of his able to quell your anger\nwithin seconds. It made you embarrassed over how quickly you had lost your\ntemper, and while you would admit that ripping a door off its hinges may have\nbeen a bit of an overreaction, those jerks really did deserve to have some fear\nput in them. </p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to blame you,\nthough, and that smile of his never left as he leaned down to press his face\nagainst your neck. His hands also went to rest on your hips, and the apartment\nwas quiet as Sero took a moment to breathe in your scent before placing a light\nkiss at the juncture of your neck and shoulder. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie, I kind of\nfigured this would happen. I ran into them a few weeks ago, and I just knew it\nwas only a matter of time before their attitudes got them in trouble with you.\nI didn\u2019t expect you to tear their door down, though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, are you still mad,\nY/N?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMm, that\u2019s alright.\u201d </p><p>Sero followed his statement\nwith a few more hot kisses to your neck, lingering with them for a moment to\nmake sure that they gave you chills. His hands also started to wonder, moving\nto caress your thighs as they were exposed by the dress that you were wearing. </p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have you mad while\nyou\u2019re at the charity, now can we? I guess I\u2019ll have to take care of you.\u201d </p><p>He briefly pulled away from\nyou to check the time on his phone, making a disappointed \u2018tsk\u2019 when he saw how\nlate it was. </p><p>\u201cHm, we don\u2019t have a lot of\ntime, though\u2026Well, I can work with it.\u201d </p><p>Before you could question\nwhat he was talking about, Sero dipped back down, this time pressing his lips\nagainst your own. It was such a gentle kiss, but it was still enough to keep\nyou distracted as Sero took both of your arms, holding them above your head and\nspinning you around until you were pressed against the wall. His hold on you\nmomentarily disappeared, but then you heard the ripping of tape, and as Sero\nfinally ended the tender kiss, he taped your hands against the wall. </p><p>\u201cKeep these here for me,\nalright?\u201d </p><p>You couldn\u2019t even properly\nreply to him before his lips were working against yours again, still gentle in\ntheir movements, matching perfectly to the light trailing of his fingers\nagainst your inner thigh. That tender touch climbed higher and higher, until\nSero\u2019s hand finally reached your clothed mound and he stroked you along the\noutside of your underwear. </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let people\nlike that get to you, you know?\u201d</p><p>As Sero slid his hand into\nyour panties, he moved his head back to your shoulder, leaning it there and\nturning his face towards your neck so that you could practically feel his words\nagainst your skin. He teased you for a moment, barely tracing his fingers\nagainst your outer labia as you tensed up with anticipation. </p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t deserve your\ntime or effort.\u201d</p><p>He finally pressed further\ninto you, humming at the warm slickness that his fingers met before he\ncontinued to caress your womanhood. </p><p>\u201cHanta, please just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. I told you that I\u2019d\ntake care of you, right? Just be a little patient.\u201d </p><p>His touch against you was\nsoothing in nature, but it did little to actually calm you. You needed more\nfrom him, and you tried to buck your hips against his hand to get the friction\nthat you craved, but you could only move so far since you were pinned against\nthe wall. You could feel his smile get bigger against your neck, and he finally\nbrought his fingers up to your clit, lightly circling them over the engorged\nbud and causing you to gasp. </p><p>\u201cSee? All you had to do was\ntrust me.\u201d </p><p>You almost groaned when he\ntook his fingers away from you, but before you could get the noise out, he was\nsliding two of his long digits into your waiting entrance, his thumb moving to\npress against your clit. You did end up groaning after that, but it was sound\nof relief instead of frustration. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so amazing, Y/N. You\nhave so much strength hidden in that beautiful body of yours, and it never\nfails to amaze me.\u201d </p><p>You couldn\u2019t reply to him,\nnot through the moan that you let out when he started to pump his fingers in\nand out of you, ever so slightly curling them forward so they could pass over\nthat sweet spot inside of you. He was also putting his thumb to work, slowly\nworking it around your clit as your legs started to tremble from all of the\nstimulation. </p><p>\u201cI feel so lucky to have\nyou, to see you smile every day, to kiss you, to touch you, to make you feel this\ngood.\u201d</p><p>His words only fueled the\nfire that was growing in your belly, and your body grew taut as your climax\ncrept closer and closer to fruition. You couldn\u2019t help but chant his name like\na prayer as he continued to work you, the last verse being shouted as your\norgasm burned through your body. Your hips stuttered against your lover\u2019s hand,\nand he pulled it away from you as you started to whimper from his overbearing\ntouch, settling to just stroke your outer folds again as you finally started to\nrelax. Once your breathing evened out, he pulled his hand away from you\ncompletely, and moved to where he was leaning his forehead against yours. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. We still have\na few minutes to clean up before we have to head out, if you still want to go.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cKind of hard to skip out on\na charity. I just need a minute. And Hanta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time, babe.\u201d </p>",
