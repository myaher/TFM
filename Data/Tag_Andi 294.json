Stop acting as if I\u2019m a bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you just&hellip; did that!\u201d Cyrus protested, hands a bit sweaty, \u201cWho just does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho just jumps on someone and kisses them?\u201d TJ countered and Cyrus shut his mouth.</p><p>Cyrus hasn\u2019t had much experience in the hand holding department. He used to boast about being the first one of his friends to hold someone else\u2019s hand, but that didn\u2019t mean he was actually an expert. It wasn\u2019t helping that nearly the entire student body was watching him fail terribly at the simple act. It had officially spread to everyone.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Cyrus could see Denise Ackerman staring at them. Her mouth fell open and her eyebrows raised as if she couldn\u2019t believe her own eyes. Denise was Kip\u2019s best friend. His number one lacky. Cyrus was about to pull away at that look alone when TJ leaned closer to whisper in his ear, pointing at her with their interlocked fingers, \u201cTake a picture, it\u2019d last longer.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt bad for laughing at that and quickly slapped his free hand over his mouth. TJ let out a laugh too and pulled his hand down, \u201cStop. It\u2019s okay to laugh, you don\u2019t have to be embarrassed, you have a cute laugh.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nods and puts his hand down while TJ turns to talk to a someone in the hall, gesturing wildly with his freehand. Cyrus felt normal, which was abnormal. He was holding hands with a boy, his boyfriend. He had a boyfriend he was just casually holding hands with! Well, a fake one but still. Maybe Cyrus was a natural at this whole thing. </p><p>But then Cyrus starts to freak out again as TJ\u2019s friend turns to face him, \u201cSo you\u2019re Cyrus right? TJ\u2019s new boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah!\u201d Cyrus squeaks out. Damn it Cyrus, Kip probably never lost his cool around TJ\u2019s friends. He cleared his throat and tried again, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s my boyfriend. The guy I\u2019m dating. Don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without him haha! Probably falling down a flight of stairs or something since I have two left feet! Or maybe-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is kinda funny,\u201d The guy starts laughing and nods at TJ.</p><p>TJ gives one last smile before he tugs Cyrus in the direction of Cyrus\u2019 locker. Once they were safely there, without anymore pit stops or too prolonged stares, they let go of eachother. Cyrus nervously fiddled with his lock, tugging it open on the third try. When he turned around, TJ had been standing too close and their heads bumped loudly. TJ rubbed at the stinging spot, \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you standing so close to me?\u201d Cyrus scowled at the pain, eyes watering a bit. He could swear he was seeing stars. Fuckin\u2019 A that hurt a lot.</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes, \u201cI was trying to kiss you, duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus looked at him incredulously. Why would he try doing that? Was that a thing they were going to have to try to do?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dating Cyrus,\u201d TJ felt like he was talking to a six year old, \u201cKissing is kind of a thing couples do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus can\u2019t do that. Not without exploding. He\u2019d never get used to that kind of affection right off the bat, it was too much lying. Cause then he\u2019d not only be lying to everyone around them, but he\u2019d have to start lying to himself. He\u2019d have to tell himself that it didn\u2019t bother him that none of it meant anything, because even if it was all fake the intimacy was real. He wanted to have something like that, but for real.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to talk about that,\u201d Cyrus put a hand on TJ\u2019s chest, pushing him away a tiny bit, \u201cCome up with some rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d TJ snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus closes his locker and slips out from the way TJ had boxed him in, \u201cRules and boundaries and the story. You know?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed as he caught up to him, \u201cOkay, fine. It might be good so you don\u2019t back out on all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Cyrus waved him off as if the thought hadn\u2019t crossed his mind about 50 times since he agreed to do it, \u201cWho do you take me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were thinking about it Cyrus,\u201d TJ said like he was sure of it, \u201cI can see you coming up with one hundred and one excuses not to do it already.\u201d</p><p>How was he so sure? He was right, but how was he so sure of himself? The confidence on the guy was outstanding.</p><p>Cyrus was looking around for a place to talk but all around them there were other students who were whispering behind hands and shifting their eyes between them. They couldn\u2019t talk there, there were too many people around. Too many people that could find out the truth.</p><p>He must have been straying pretty far away from the school unconsciously because TJ suddenly tugged on his arm, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe park,\u201d Cyrus\u2019 mouth moved before his brain was able to process what he was saying, \u201cNo one from school will be there.\u201d</p><p>TJ seemed to accept this explanation and followed him diligently. Cyrus was too busy trying to come up with what he wanted to say to be paying attention to where he was going. His pace slowed does and he was looking down at his feet in a daze, caught up in his thoughts. TJ ended up dragging them the rest of the way there, stopping at the old swing set, \u201cThe swings TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He let his backpack drop to the ground, \u201cWe used to come here all the time together. It seemed appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was surprised he remembered something from almost four years ago now, but it didn\u2019t stop him from sitting down and dragging his feet. He had pulled out his notebook and a pencil, \u201cOkay. So first I think we should come up with how we got together. If we don\u2019t have matching stories people will be able to tell we\u2019re faking right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems reasonable,\u201d TJ was pumping his legs a little, making sure not to go too high so they could still talk, \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus seemed to smile at that, the romantic in him was giddy, \u201cHow about this. You found me after I crashed my car and comforted me. You decided to wait with me until the tow truck came and you decided to drive me home, you were all nervous. You wrung your hands because you\u2019ve kinda been into me since middle school,\u201d Cyrus clasped his hands together and lowered his voice a ridiculous amount, \u201cOh Cyrus! How I love thee. And since I was your first kiss you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know if you were my first kiss?\u201d TJ interrupted.</p><p>Cyrus continued without paying any attention to his comment, \u201cSince I was your first kiss you\u2019ve always thought there was something special there. You had to take a chance so you did because you\u2019re 95% confidence and 5% hair gel and we started dating ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to believe that,\u201d TJ shook his head, \u201cEspecially not Kip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best lies are the ones closest to the truth, TJ,\u201d Cyrus said in a matter of fact tone, \u201cWe did kiss in middle school. It was a first for at least one of us. And you did stop when I got into that accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s just that I went to see Kip that day,\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow, \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay minor detail,\u201d Cyrus waved it off, \u201cI was in your head when you went to go see Kip and when he broke it off you took it as a sign. So then you rushed right over to my house with flowers and asked me out on my front porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the all figured out, don\u2019t you Underdog?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m really okay at. But while we&rsquo;re at it, we need to talk about rules. For example, I don\u2019t want you to kiss me anymore.\u201d</p><p>TJ let his feet drag against the mulch until he was still, \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not like I want to either. My head still kinda hurts from earlier, I don\u2019t want to get any more concussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. But we should write this all down,\u201d Cyrus started to scribble in his notebook. He neatly writes Contract on the top of the page before skipping down and placing \u2018No Kissing\u2019 next to the first bullet point.</p><p>TJ tried to look over, nearly falling out of the swing, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of writing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor proof. Just in case we break a rule and one of use tries to claim that it wasn\u2019t on there.\u201d</p><p>TJ let out a breathy laugh, \u201cOkay, but I doubt anyone is going to believe we\u2019re a couple if I can\u2019t touch you. Again, kissing is kind of a big couple thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of other ways to show that you care about a person that doesn\u2019t involve PDA,\u201d Cyrus nervously bites the bottom of his lip. PDA would help sell their story faster though, and this thing wasn\u2019t supposed to last too long. No! He couldn\u2019t get distracted.</p><p>\u201cWell no one&rsquo;s going to believe that I turned into a saint to date you,\u201d TJ huffed, \u201cYou gotta let me do something. How about I put my hand in the back pocket of your jeans?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyebrows scrunched up in concern, \u201cI don\u2019t wear jeans that often. Mostly khakis or corduroys.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed at that. The jean thing was so not the point, \u201cWell do they have back pockets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Cyrus turned got up off of the swing and turned his head back as far as he could. He was wearing a pair of his favorite khakis right now. He thinks he saw a pocket, but it was hard to tell and with the notebook and pencil in his hand he didn\u2019t want to fumble to reach and check, \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ shook his head, \u201cThey do. So I can do that, strictly as a business thing.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods and sits back down to write it in the notebook \u2018TJ can put his hand in Cyrus\u2019 back pocket\u2019. \u201cBut no kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me remind you that you started that whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I just wish that I could do that for real, you know?\u201d Cyrus sighs and halts his writing, \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that before, it\u2019s probably why I banged out heads together. Sorry about that. I just thought that the first time I\u2019d get to do all this stuff I\u2019d actually be dating someone who liked me. And who I liked just as much back. This situation isn\u2019t exactly ideal for all these firsts.\u201d</p><p>TJ seemed to take a moment to process all of it, nodding slowly, \u201cOkay. So we can save some things for you to do. For when this is all real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t want to steal all of your firsts,\u201d TJ\u2019s laugh was light and he gave Cyrus a sly look, \u201cI already have your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could tell that TJ was trying to lighten the mood. He was trying to be nice and considerate. Go figure.</p><p>\u201cSo that also means that I won\u2019t pay for anything,\u201d TJ shrugged and started swinging again, the creaks from the old chains made him have to talk a bit louder, \u201cSomeone who really likes you can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to pay for my own stuff anyways,\u201d Cyrus frowned at that, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anything from you.\u201d</p><p>TJ didn\u2019t pay any mind to it, \u201cI won\u2019t walk you to class, or buy you flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied curtly, \u201cWas there anything the you and Kip did that was special?\u201d</p><p>TJ came to an abrupt halt, staring down at his hands, \u201cNotes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ shook his head in an annoyed manner, \u201cHe made me write him all these notes. I don\u2019t understand why, my handwriting isn&rsquo;t \u00a0the best and it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t text each other.\u201d</p><p>But Cyrus could understand why Kip would want notes. They were sweet because it did require some sort of effort to write them. And it was something he could just stare at and hold and keep close to his chest. Something he could re-read on a bad day just as a pick me up kind of thing. It was hard cold proof that TJ cared about him, loved him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you one everyday,\u201d TJ said suddenly, a confident and bright smile on his face, \u201cIt\u2019ll drive him crazy.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nods and writes it down, \u2018TJ will write Cyrus a note (everyday?)\u2019</p><p>\u201cAlso write down that you have to come to some parties with me,\u201d TJ adds, pointing down at the notebook, \u201cAnd no weird Sci-fi movies unless it\u2019s something cool like Star Wars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offended by that nerd stereotype,\u201d Cyrus glared up at him, \u201cI don\u2019t watch only Sci-fi movies.\u201d</p><p>TJ clicks his tongue, \u201cOh yeah I forgot. You like to watch those lizard documentaries right? Well none of those either, unless you want me to fall asleep on you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was honestly too shocked that TJ remembered that detail about him to really care. He\u2019d probably make TJ watch one anyways, and then maybe he\u2019d see how amazing they were.</p><p>Suddenly TJ is grabbing the pencil and notebook from his hands, writing down \u2018Cyrus will make a picture of TJ his phone background. Cyrus snatched it back, \u201cYou too!\u201d He pulled his phone out quickly to try and catch TJ off guard, \u201cSay cheese!\u201d</p><p>He still looks unfairly handsome in the picture. A nice and light smile on his lips and his eyes filled with amusement. The higher powers were really unfair sometimes. </p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d TJ points his camera in Cyrus\u2019 direction and snaps a quick photo. He sits there for a moment, looking it over and fiddling with his phone to set it as his wallpaper, \u201cCute.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tried not to blush, but he know he lost that battle when the heat hit his cheeks. Out of all the damn things that happened, this was the thing that made him blush the most? \u201cOkay, last rule. We can tell absolutely no one about this. No one. If Buffy or Andi found out what I was doing, they\u2019d be so mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst rule of fight club.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nodded like he understood the reference. He\u2019d have to google it later. He sighed, \u201cWhat about an end date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a deadline. How long are we going to do this for? A week? Month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just see where it goes?\u201d TJ shrugs like it\u2019s no big deal. </p><p>Cyrus started to stumble over his words, \u201cBut- If we don\u2019t have something set- I just feel like-\u201d</p><p>TJ laughs and cuts him off, grabbing the chains attached to Cyrus\u2019 swing, \u201cCyrus, you have to just relax. Not everything has to be planned down to a T. Go with the flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice from the great TJ Kippen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here all week,\u201d TJ jokes back, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods a bit before stopping himself, \u201cOkay but we have to be over by Christmas. Too many relatives come around and I hate lying to all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely have no problem by then,\u201d TJ said confidently. Like he always does.</p><p>They both sign on the lines that Cyrus drew, sealing the contract. There was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus hopped off the swing, \u201cI should get going.\u201d</p><p>TJ agreed and started walking back towards the school, confused when Cyrus started walking in the opposite direction, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Cyrus perked up, confused. He just wanted to pull out his earbuds and walk home in peace.</p><p>TJ tilted his head, \u201cYou\u2019re walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my car remember?\u201d Cyrus raised an inquisitive eyebrow, \u201cI\u2019ve been walking everywhere. It\u2019s actually been quite a good work out. Buffy is not happy about the fact that we have to walk to school now though.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled, \u201cWell I could give you a ride home if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Cyrus declined politely, \u201cThere is no way that I\u2019m ever going to get into that death trap of a car you have. All of my friends and I agreed that we would never buy a car that doesn\u2019t have at least seven safety features.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d TJ shrugged and walked off. </p><p>Cyrus plugged his earbuds in and started the rest of his walk home. He was almost out of the park until he hit the entrance by the small pond. Jonah. Jonah was there playing frisbee with some person he couldn\u2019t remember the name of. It seemed like Jonah noticed him too because he started to wave Cyrus over.</p><p>\u201cHey Cy-guy! What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much!\u201d Cyrus smiled back, \u201cGuess what? TJ and I aren\u2019t broken up. It was a just big misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Jonah\u2019s face scrunched up in thought for a split second, concern in his eyes. But it disappeared just as quickly as it had appeared, replaced with the signature Jonah Beck smile, \u201cThat\u2019s great news! I\u2019m happy for you. If he ever does anything though, you can always count on me to rough him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary,\u201d Cyrus nervously laughed, \u201cBut thanks for the thought.\u201d</p><p>Jonah shrugged, \u201cIt was kind of an empty threat anyways, I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019d last in a fight. I better get back to practice though, talk later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Cyrus watched as Jonah waved and skipped back over to the guy he had been throwing with. Now that Jonah knew for a fact that Cyrus wasn\u2019t in love with him and that he was with TJ now, maybe things would go back to normal. Like the stupid letter never happened. </p><p>He was so happy that the plan was working that he couldn\u2019t stop smiling all night. And he must have still been smiling the next morning too because Buffy nugged him on the walk to school, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the weird smile Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d Cyrus mumbled before clapping his hands together, \u201cJust thinking about stuff.\u201d</p><p>Buffy scrunched her nose up, her voice laced with thinly veiled disgust, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>Which was good, because he wasn\u2019t telling. The weather was cold, as is it normally is in the middle of fall. Cyrus was wrapped up in a navy cable knit sweater and his dark gray peacoat. He had accidentally forgot his gloves but he had a nice, puffy white knit scarf and his trusty black beanie on to make up for the loss. It was weather like this that made him wish that he liked driving. He knew Buffy wasn\u2019t too pleased to be waddling around in fall layers either, but she complained less once she saw exactly how distressed Cyrus seemed.</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy whispered suddenly, pulling him out of his thoughts, \u201cDon\u2019t make it obvious, but look. Is that car following us?\u201d</p><p>He had to resist the urge to panic and whip his head around. He slowly looked, yes that van was slowly creeping on them. Should he run? Did they have time to run? Buffy probably could escape but what could he do? He little legs were basically useless!</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to figure it out because the car pulled up next to them and the window rolled down. Cyrus squeezed his eyes shut and blocked his face with his hands, squeaking out, \u201cPlease I have nothing valuable don\u2019t kidnap me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises Underdog, you\u2019re looking pretty adorable in that scarf,\u201d He cracked an eye open and saw TJ behind the wheel. Of a minivan. The definition of a soccer mom car. The two on the sidewalk must have been staring for a second too long because he rolled his eyes and pointed to the back door, \u201cAre you guys getting in or?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you driving?\u201d Buffy asked, laughing in shock as she climbed in to the back, motioning for Cyrus to take the front.</p><p>\u201cA mini-van Buffy,\u201d TJ gave her a pointed look in the mirror, smirking, \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Buffy buckled in, \u201cI just wasn\u2019t aware that you knew how to drive something other than that accident on wheels.\u201d</p><p>Once Cyrus was in the car, the door slamming, TJ smiled, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too,\u201d Cyrus said, unsure of what to say, \u201cThanks for driving us.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting the car back into drive, \u201cWhat kind of boyfriend would I be if I let you walk all the way in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is really for real?\u201d Buffy leaned forward, poking her head between the two seats, \u201cFor some reason this all still feels like a freakish dream. Or a nightmare, I\u2019m trying to pick between the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were friends Buffy,\u201d TJ offered an exaggerated pout, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Buffy huffed, \u201cWatch it Kippen. I will snap your neck if Cyrus so much as frowns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t happen Driscoll,\u201d TJ said, easily taking one of Cyrus\u2019 hands off of the middle consol, lacing their fingers together slowly for show, \u201cI am the perfect boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Buffy let out a loud snort, \u201cHa! Perfect my ass TJ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d TJ said, Buffy slightly flinching at the words, \u201cCyrus is the perfect boyfriend. Aren\u2019t you muffin?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus pulled their hands into his lap, tempted to swipe his hand away, \u201cI\u2019m not getting involved this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut thanks,\u201d Buffy said reluctantly, \u201cFor the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d TJ lets a small smile slip out.</p><p>Cyrus could live like this. Maybe. He still felt bad about lying to his best friends, but this. This felt normal. It felt nostalgic. It felt right. They haven\u2019t all hung out in so long, and he missed it. Even if Buffy and TJ argued a lot. It didn\u2019t stop his stomach from dropping once he realize that it would all be gone within the next month. Would he and TJ still even be friends after all of this? Or would it all go back? Cyrus hoped that they would still talk. He didn\u2019t realize how much he missed it until they started again.</p><hr><p>Thanks so much for reading! If you want to be on the tag list lemme know!

It did not take that long for Cyrus to find out what it would be like when everyone stared at him. It was even more staring and whispering than the morning that Cyrus jumped him, which he didn\u2019t think was possible.<b><br></b></p><p>TJ sighed, mouth pulled into an amused smile, \u201cRelax. Stop acting as if I\u2019m a bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you just\u2026 did that!\u201d Cyrus protested, hands a bit sweaty, \u201cWho just does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho just jumps on someone and kisses them?\u201d TJ countered and Cyrus shut his mouth.</p><p>Cyrus hasn\u2019t had much experience in the hand holding department. He used to boast about being the first one of his friends to hold someone else\u2019s hand, but that didn\u2019t mean he was actually an expert. It wasn\u2019t helping that nearly the entire student body was watching him fail terribly at the simple act. It had officially spread to everyone.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Cyrus could see Denise Ackerman staring at them. Her mouth fell open and her eyebrows raised as if she couldn\u2019t believe her own eyes. Denise was Kip\u2019s best friend. His number one lacky. Cyrus was about to pull away at that look alone when TJ leaned closer to whisper in his ear, pointing at her with their interlocked fingers, \u201cTake a picture, it\u2019d last longer.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt bad for laughing at that and quickly slapped his free hand over his mouth. TJ let out a laugh too and pulled his hand down, \u201cStop. It\u2019s okay to laugh, you don\u2019t have to be embarrassed, you have a cute laugh.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nods and puts his hand down while TJ turns to talk to a someone in the hall, gesturing wildly with his freehand. Cyrus felt normal, which was abnormal. He was holding hands with a boy, his boyfriend. He had a boyfriend he was just casually holding hands with! Well, a fake one but still. Maybe Cyrus was a natural at this whole thing. </p><p>But then Cyrus starts to freak out again as TJ\u2019s friend turns to face him, \u201cSo you\u2019re Cyrus right? TJ\u2019s new boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah!\u201d Cyrus squeaks out. Damn it Cyrus, Kip probably never lost his cool around TJ\u2019s friends. He cleared his throat and tried again, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s my boyfriend. The guy I\u2019m dating. Don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without him haha! Probably falling down a flight of stairs or something since I have two left feet! Or maybe-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is kinda funny,\u201d The guy starts laughing and nods at TJ.</p><p>TJ gives one last smile before he tugs Cyrus in the direction of Cyrus\u2019 locker. Once they were safely there, without anymore pit stops or too prolonged stares, they let go of eachother. Cyrus nervously fiddled with his lock, tugging it open on the third try. When he turned around, TJ had been standing too close and their heads bumped loudly. TJ rubbed at the stinging spot, \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you standing so close to me?\u201d Cyrus scowled at the pain, eyes watering a bit. He could swear he was seeing stars. Fuckin\u2019 A that hurt a lot.</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes, \u201cI was trying to kiss you, duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus looked at him incredulously. Why would he try doing that? Was that a thing they were going to have to try to do?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dating Cyrus,\u201d TJ felt like he was talking to a six year old, \u201cKissing is kind of a thing couples do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus can\u2019t do that. Not without exploding. He\u2019d never get used to that kind of affection right off the bat, it was too much lying. Cause then he\u2019d not only be lying to everyone around them, but he\u2019d have to start lying to himself. He\u2019d have to tell himself that it didn\u2019t bother him that none of it meant anything, because even if it was all fake the intimacy was real. He wanted to have something like that, but for real.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to talk about that,\u201d Cyrus put a hand on TJ\u2019s chest, pushing him away a tiny bit, \u201cCome up with some rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d TJ snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus closes his locker and slips out from the way TJ had boxed him in, \u201cRules and boundaries and the story. You know?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed as he caught up to him, \u201cOkay, fine. It might be good so you don\u2019t back out on all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Cyrus waved him off as if the thought hadn\u2019t crossed his mind about 50 times since he agreed to do it, \u201cWho do you take me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were thinking about it Cyrus,\u201d TJ said like he was sure of it, \u201cI can see you coming up with one hundred and one excuses not to do it already.\u201d</p><p>How was he so sure? He was right, but how was he so sure of himself? The confidence on the guy was outstanding.</p><p>Cyrus was looking around for a place to talk but all around them there were other students who were whispering behind hands and shifting their eyes between them. They couldn\u2019t talk there, there were too many people around. Too many people that could find out the truth.</p><p>He must have been straying pretty far away from the school unconsciously because TJ suddenly tugged on his arm, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe park,\u201d Cyrus\u2019 mouth moved before his brain was able to process what he was saying, \u201cNo one from school will be there.\u201d</p><p>TJ seemed to accept this explanation and followed him diligently. Cyrus was too busy trying to come up with what he wanted to say to be paying attention to where he was going. His pace slowed does and he was looking down at his feet in a daze, caught up in his thoughts. TJ ended up dragging them the rest of the way there, stopping at the old swing set, \u201cThe swings TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He let his backpack drop to the ground, \u201cWe used to come here all the time together. It seemed appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was surprised he remembered something from almost four years ago now, but it didn\u2019t stop him from sitting down and dragging his feet. He had pulled out his notebook and a pencil, \u201cOkay. So first I think we should come up with how we got together. If we don\u2019t have matching stories people will be able to tell we\u2019re faking right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems reasonable,\u201d TJ was pumping his legs a little, making sure not to go too high so they could still talk, \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus seemed to smile at that, the romantic in him was giddy, \u201cHow about this. You found me after I crashed my car and comforted me. You decided to wait with me until the tow truck came and you decided to drive me home, you were all nervous. You wrung your hands because you\u2019ve kinda been into me since middle school,\u201d Cyrus clasped his hands together and lowered his voice a ridiculous amount, \u201cOh Cyrus! How I love thee. And since I was your first kiss you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know if you were my first kiss?\u201d TJ interrupted.</p><p>Cyrus continued without paying any attention to his comment, \u201cSince I was your first kiss you\u2019ve always thought there was something special there. You had to take a chance so you did because you\u2019re 95% confidence and 5% hair gel and we started dating ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to believe that,\u201d TJ shook his head, \u201cEspecially not Kip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best lies are the ones closest to the truth, TJ,\u201d Cyrus said in a matter of fact tone, \u201cWe did kiss in middle school. It was a first for at least one of us. And you did stop when I got into that accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s just that I went to see Kip that day,\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow, \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay minor detail,\u201d Cyrus waved it off, \u201cI was in your head when you went to go see Kip and when he broke it off you took it as a sign. So then you rushed right over to my house with flowers and asked me out on my front porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the all figured out, don\u2019t you Underdog?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m really okay at. But while we\u2019re at it, we need to talk about rules. For example, I don\u2019t want you to kiss me anymore.\u201d</p><p>TJ let his feet drag against the mulch until he was still, \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not like I want to either. My head still kinda hurts from earlier, I don\u2019t want to get any more concussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. But we should write this all down,\u201d Cyrus started to scribble in his notebook. He neatly writes Contract on the top of the page before skipping down and placing \u2018No Kissing\u2019 next to the first bullet point.</p><p>TJ tried to look over, nearly falling out of the swing, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of writing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor proof. Just in case we break a rule and one of use tries to claim that it wasn\u2019t on there.\u201d</p><p>TJ let out a breathy laugh, \u201cOkay, but I doubt anyone is going to believe we\u2019re a couple if I can\u2019t touch you. Again, kissing is kind of a big couple thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of other ways to show that you care about a person that doesn\u2019t involve PDA,\u201d Cyrus nervously bites the bottom of his lip. PDA would help sell their story faster though, and this thing wasn\u2019t supposed to last too long. No! He couldn\u2019t get distracted.</p><p>\u201cWell no one\u2019s going to believe that I turned into a saint to date you,\u201d TJ huffed, \u201cYou gotta let me do something. How about I put my hand in the back pocket of your jeans?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyebrows scrunched up in concern, \u201cI don\u2019t wear jeans that often. Mostly khakis or corduroys.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed at that. The jean thing was so not the point, \u201cWell do they have back pockets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Cyrus turned got up off of the swing and turned his head back as far as he could. He was wearing a pair of his favorite khakis right now. He thinks he saw a pocket, but it was hard to tell and with the notebook and pencil in his hand he didn\u2019t want to fumble to reach and check, \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ shook his head, \u201cThey do. So I can do that, strictly as a business thing.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods and sits back down to write it in the notebook \u2018TJ can put his hand in Cyrus\u2019 back pocket\u2019. \u201cBut no kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me remind you that you started that whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I just wish that I could do that for real, you know?\u201d Cyrus sighs and halts his writing, \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that before, it\u2019s probably why I banged out heads together. Sorry about that. I just thought that the first time I\u2019d get to do all this stuff I\u2019d actually be dating someone who liked me. And who I liked just as much back. This situation isn\u2019t exactly ideal for all these firsts.\u201d</p><p>TJ seemed to take a moment to process all of it, nodding slowly, \u201cOkay. So we can save some things for you to do. For when this is all real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t want to steal all of your firsts,\u201d TJ\u2019s laugh was light and he gave Cyrus a sly look, \u201cI already have your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could tell that TJ was trying to lighten the mood. He was trying to be nice and considerate. Go figure.</p><p>\u201cSo that also means that I won\u2019t pay for anything,\u201d TJ shrugged and started swinging again, the creaks from the old chains made him have to talk a bit louder, \u201cSomeone who really likes you can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to pay for my own stuff anyways,\u201d Cyrus frowned at that, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anything from you.\u201d</p><p>TJ didn\u2019t pay any mind to it, \u201cI won\u2019t walk you to class, or buy you flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied curtly, \u201cWas there anything the you and Kip did that was special?\u201d</p><p>TJ came to an abrupt halt, staring down at his hands, \u201cNotes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ shook his head in an annoyed manner, \u201cHe made me write him all these notes. I don\u2019t understand why, my handwriting isn\u2019t \u00a0the best and it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t text each other.\u201d</p><p>But Cyrus could understand why Kip would want notes. They were sweet because it did require some sort of effort to write them. And it was something he could just stare at and hold and keep close to his chest. Something he could re-read on a bad day just as a pick me up kind of thing. It was hard cold proof that TJ cared about him, loved him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you one everyday,\u201d TJ said suddenly, a confident and bright smile on his face, \u201cIt\u2019ll drive him crazy.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nods and writes it down, \u2018TJ will write Cyrus a note (everyday?)\u2019</p><p>\u201cAlso write down that you have to come to some parties with me,\u201d TJ adds, pointing down at the notebook, \u201cAnd no weird Sci-fi movies unless it\u2019s something cool like Star Wars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offended by that nerd stereotype,\u201d Cyrus glared up at him, \u201cI don\u2019t watch only Sci-fi movies.\u201d</p><p>TJ clicks his tongue, \u201cOh yeah I forgot. You like to watch those lizard documentaries right? Well none of those either, unless you want me to fall asleep on you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was honestly too shocked that TJ remembered that detail about him to really care. He\u2019d probably make TJ watch one anyways, and then maybe he\u2019d see how amazing they were.</p><p>Suddenly TJ is grabbing the pencil and notebook from his hands, writing down \u2018Cyrus will make a picture of TJ his phone background. Cyrus snatched it back, \u201cYou too!\u201d He pulled his phone out quickly to try and catch TJ off guard, \u201cSay cheese!\u201d</p><p>He still looks unfairly handsome in the picture. A nice and light smile on his lips and his eyes filled with amusement. The higher powers were really unfair sometimes. </p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d TJ points his camera in Cyrus\u2019 direction and snaps a quick photo. He sits there for a moment, looking it over and fiddling with his phone to set it as his wallpaper, \u201cCute.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tried not to blush, but he know he lost that battle when the heat hit his cheeks. Out of all the damn things that happened, this was the thing that made him blush the most? \u201cOkay, last rule. We can tell absolutely no one about this. No one. If Buffy or Andi found out what I was doing, they\u2019d be so mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst rule of fight club.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nodded like he understood the reference. He\u2019d have to google it later. He sighed, \u201cWhat about an end date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a deadline. How long are we going to do this for? A week? Month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just see where it goes?\u201d TJ shrugs like it\u2019s no big deal. </p><p>Cyrus started to stumble over his words, \u201cBut- If we don\u2019t have something set- I just feel like-\u201d</p><p>TJ laughs and cuts him off, grabbing the chains attached to Cyrus\u2019 swing, \u201cCyrus, you have to just relax. Not everything has to be planned down to a T. Go with the flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice from the great TJ Kippen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here all week,\u201d TJ jokes back, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods a bit before stopping himself, \u201cOkay but we have to be over by Christmas. Too many relatives come around and I hate lying to all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely have no problem by then,\u201d TJ said confidently. Like he always does.</p><p>They both sign on the lines that Cyrus drew, sealing the contract. There was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus hopped off the swing, \u201cI should get going.\u201d</p><p>TJ agreed and started walking back towards the school, confused when Cyrus started walking in the opposite direction, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Cyrus perked up, confused. He just wanted to pull out his earbuds and walk home in peace.</p><p>TJ tilted his head, \u201cYou\u2019re walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my car remember?\u201d Cyrus raised an inquisitive eyebrow, \u201cI\u2019ve been walking everywhere. It\u2019s actually been quite a good work out. Buffy is not happy about the fact that we have to walk to school now though.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled, \u201cWell I could give you a ride home if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Cyrus declined politely, \u201cThere is no way that I\u2019m ever going to get into that death trap of a car you have. All of my friends and I agreed that we would never buy a car that doesn\u2019t have at least seven safety features.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d TJ shrugged and walked off. </p><p>Cyrus plugged his earbuds in and started the rest of his walk home. He was almost out of the park until he hit the entrance by the small pond. Jonah. Jonah was there playing frisbee with some person he couldn\u2019t remember the name of. It seemed like Jonah noticed him too because he started to wave Cyrus over.</p><p>\u201cHey Cy-guy! What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much!\u201d Cyrus smiled back, \u201cGuess what? TJ and I aren\u2019t broken up. It was a just big misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Jonah\u2019s face scrunched up in thought for a split second, concern in his eyes. But it disappeared just as quickly as it had appeared, replaced with the signature Jonah Beck smile, \u201cThat\u2019s great news! I\u2019m happy for you. If he ever does anything though, you can always count on me to rough him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary,\u201d Cyrus nervously laughed, \u201cBut thanks for the thought.\u201d</p><p>Jonah shrugged, \u201cIt was kind of an empty threat anyways, I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019d last in a fight. I better get back to practice though, talk later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Cyrus watched as Jonah waved and skipped back over to the guy he had been throwing with. Now that Jonah knew for a fact that Cyrus wasn\u2019t in love with him and that he was with TJ now, maybe things would go back to normal. Like the stupid letter never happened. </p><p>He was so happy that the plan was working that he couldn\u2019t stop smiling all night. And he must have still been smiling the next morning too because Buffy nugged him on the walk to school, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the weird smile Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d Cyrus mumbled before clapping his hands together, \u201cJust thinking about stuff.\u201d</p><p>Buffy scrunched her nose up, her voice laced with thinly veiled disgust, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>Which was good, because he wasn\u2019t telling. The weather was cold, as is it normally is in the middle of fall. Cyrus was wrapped up in a navy cable knit sweater and his dark gray peacoat. He had accidentally forgot his gloves but he had a nice, puffy white knit scarf and his trusty black beanie on to make up for the loss. It was weather like this that made him wish that he liked driving. He knew Buffy wasn\u2019t too pleased to be waddling around in fall layers either, but she complained less once she saw exactly how distressed Cyrus seemed.</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy whispered suddenly, pulling him out of his thoughts, \u201cDon\u2019t make it obvious, but look. Is that car following us?\u201d</p><p>He had to resist the urge to panic and whip his head around. He slowly looked, yes that van was slowly creeping on them. Should he run? Did they have time to run? Buffy probably could escape but what could he do? He little legs were basically useless!</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to figure it out because the car pulled up next to them and the window rolled down. Cyrus squeezed his eyes shut and blocked his face with his hands, squeaking out, \u201cPlease I have nothing valuable don\u2019t kidnap me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises Underdog, you\u2019re looking pretty adorable in that scarf,\u201d He cracked an eye open and saw TJ behind the wheel. Of a minivan. The definition of a soccer mom car. The two on the sidewalk must have been staring for a second too long because he rolled his eyes and pointed to the back door, \u201cAre you guys getting in or?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you driving?\u201d Buffy asked, laughing in shock as she climbed in to the back, motioning for Cyrus to take the front.</p><p>\u201cA mini-van Buffy,\u201d TJ gave her a pointed look in the mirror, smirking, \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Buffy buckled in, \u201cI just wasn\u2019t aware that you knew how to drive something other than that accident on wheels.\u201d</p><p>Once Cyrus was in the car, the door slamming, TJ smiled, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too,\u201d Cyrus said, unsure of what to say, \u201cThanks for driving us.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting the car back into drive, \u201cWhat kind of boyfriend would I be if I let you walk all the way in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is really for real?\u201d Buffy leaned forward, poking her head between the two seats, \u201cFor some reason this all still feels like a freakish dream. Or a nightmare, I\u2019m trying to pick between the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were friends Buffy,\u201d TJ offered an exaggerated pout, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Buffy huffed, \u201cWatch it Kippen. I will snap your neck if Cyrus so much as frowns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t happen Driscoll,\u201d TJ said, easily taking one of Cyrus\u2019 hands off of the middle consol, lacing their fingers together slowly for show, \u201cI am the perfect boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Buffy let out a loud snort, \u201cHa! Perfect my ass TJ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d TJ said, Buffy slightly flinching at the words, \u201cCyrus is the perfect boyfriend. Aren\u2019t you muffin?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus pulled their hands into his lap, tempted to swipe his hand away, \u201cI\u2019m not getting involved this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut thanks,\u201d Buffy said reluctantly, \u201cFor the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d TJ lets a small smile slip out.</p><p>Cyrus could live like this. Maybe. He still felt bad about lying to his best friends, but this. This felt normal. It felt nostalgic. It felt right. They haven\u2019t all hung out in so long, and he missed it. Even if Buffy and TJ argued a lot. It didn\u2019t stop his stomach from dropping once he realize that it would all be gone within the next month. Would he and TJ still even be friends after all of this? Or would it all go back? Cyrus hoped that they would still talk. He didn\u2019t realize how much he missed it until they started again.</p><hr><p>Thanks so much for reading! If you want to be on the tag list lemme know!

It did not take that long for Cyrus to find out what it would be like when everyone stared at him. It was even more staring and whispering than the morning that Cyrus jumped him, which he didn\u2019t think was possible.<b><br></b></p><p>TJ sighed, mouth pulled into an amused smile, \u201cRelax. Stop acting as if I\u2019m a bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you just\u2026 did that!\u201d Cyrus protested, hands a bit sweaty, \u201cWho just does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho just jumps on someone and kisses them?\u201d TJ countered and Cyrus shut his mouth.</p><p>Cyrus hasn\u2019t had much experience in the hand holding department. He used to boast about being the first one of his friends to hold someone else\u2019s hand, but that didn\u2019t mean he was actually an expert. It wasn\u2019t helping that nearly the entire student body was watching him fail terribly at the simple act. It had officially spread to everyone.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Cyrus could see Denise Ackerman staring at them. Her mouth fell open and her eyebrows raised as if she couldn\u2019t believe her own eyes. Denise was Kip\u2019s best friend. His number one lacky. Cyrus was about to pull away at that look alone when TJ leaned closer to whisper in his ear, pointing at her with their interlocked fingers, \u201cTake a picture, it\u2019d last longer.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt bad for laughing at that and quickly slapped his free hand over his mouth. TJ let out a laugh too and pulled his hand down, \u201cStop. It\u2019s okay to laugh, you don\u2019t have to be embarrassed, you have a cute laugh.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nods and puts his hand down while TJ turns to talk to a someone in the hall, gesturing wildly with his freehand. Cyrus felt normal, which was abnormal. He was holding hands with a boy, his boyfriend. He had a boyfriend he was just casually holding hands with! Well, a fake one but still. Maybe Cyrus was a natural at this whole thing. </p><p>But then Cyrus starts to freak out again as TJ\u2019s friend turns to face him, \u201cSo you\u2019re Cyrus right? TJ\u2019s new boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yeah!\u201d Cyrus squeaks out. Damn it Cyrus, Kip probably never lost his cool around TJ\u2019s friends. He cleared his throat and tried again, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s my boyfriend. The guy I\u2019m dating. Don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without him haha! Probably falling down a flight of stairs or something since I have two left feet! Or maybe-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is kinda funny,\u201d The guy starts laughing and nods at TJ.</p><p>TJ gives one last smile before he tugs Cyrus in the direction of Cyrus\u2019 locker. Once they were safely there, without anymore pit stops or too prolonged stares, they let go of eachother. Cyrus nervously fiddled with his lock, tugging it open on the third try. When he turned around, TJ had been standing too close and their heads bumped loudly. TJ rubbed at the stinging spot, \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you standing so close to me?\u201d Cyrus scowled at the pain, eyes watering a bit. He could swear he was seeing stars. Fuckin\u2019 A that hurt a lot.</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes, \u201cI was trying to kiss you, duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus looked at him incredulously. Why would he try doing that? Was that a thing they were going to have to try to do?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dating Cyrus,\u201d TJ felt like he was talking to a six year old, \u201cKissing is kind of a thing couples do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus can\u2019t do that. Not without exploding. He\u2019d never get used to that kind of affection right off the bat, it was too much lying. Cause then he\u2019d not only be lying to everyone around them, but he\u2019d have to start lying to himself. He\u2019d have to tell himself that it didn\u2019t bother him that none of it meant anything, because even if it was all fake the intimacy was real. He wanted to have something like that, but for real.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to talk about that,\u201d Cyrus put a hand on TJ\u2019s chest, pushing him away a tiny bit, \u201cCome up with some rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d TJ snorted.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus closes his locker and slips out from the way TJ had boxed him in, \u201cRules and boundaries and the story. You know?\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed as he caught up to him, \u201cOkay, fine. It might be good so you don\u2019t back out on all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Cyrus waved him off as if the thought hadn\u2019t crossed his mind about 50 times since he agreed to do it, \u201cWho do you take me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were thinking about it Cyrus,\u201d TJ said like he was sure of it, \u201cI can see you coming up with one hundred and one excuses not to do it already.\u201d</p><p>How was he so sure? He was right, but how was he so sure of himself? The confidence on the guy was outstanding.</p><p>Cyrus was looking around for a place to talk but all around them there were other students who were whispering behind hands and shifting their eyes between them. They couldn\u2019t talk there, there were too many people around. Too many people that could find out the truth.</p><p>He must have been straying pretty far away from the school unconsciously because TJ suddenly tugged on his arm, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe park,\u201d Cyrus\u2019 mouth moved before his brain was able to process what he was saying, \u201cNo one from school will be there.\u201d</p><p>TJ seemed to accept this explanation and followed him diligently. Cyrus was too busy trying to come up with what he wanted to say to be paying attention to where he was going. His pace slowed does and he was looking down at his feet in a daze, caught up in his thoughts. TJ ended up dragging them the rest of the way there, stopping at the old swing set, \u201cThe swings TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He let his backpack drop to the ground, \u201cWe used to come here all the time together. It seemed appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was surprised he remembered something from almost four years ago now, but it didn\u2019t stop him from sitting down and dragging his feet. He had pulled out his notebook and a pencil, \u201cOkay. So first I think we should come up with how we got together. If we don\u2019t have matching stories people will be able to tell we\u2019re faking right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems reasonable,\u201d TJ was pumping his legs a little, making sure not to go too high so they could still talk, \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus seemed to smile at that, the romantic in him was giddy, \u201cHow about this. You found me after I crashed my car and comforted me. You decided to wait with me until the tow truck came and you decided to drive me home, you were all nervous. You wrung your hands because you\u2019ve kinda been into me since middle school,\u201d Cyrus clasped his hands together and lowered his voice a ridiculous amount, \u201cOh Cyrus! How I love thee. And since I was your first kiss you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know if you were my first kiss?\u201d TJ interrupted.</p><p>Cyrus continued without paying any attention to his comment, \u201cSince I was your first kiss you\u2019ve always thought there was something special there. You had to take a chance so you did because you\u2019re 95% confidence and 5% hair gel and we started dating ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is going to believe that,\u201d TJ shook his head, \u201cEspecially not Kip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best lies are the ones closest to the truth, TJ,\u201d Cyrus said in a matter of fact tone, \u201cWe did kiss in middle school. It was a first for at least one of us. And you did stop when I got into that accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s just that I went to see Kip that day,\u201d TJ raised an eyebrow, \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay minor detail,\u201d Cyrus waved it off, \u201cI was in your head when you went to go see Kip and when he broke it off you took it as a sign. So then you rushed right over to my house with flowers and asked me out on my front porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the all figured out, don\u2019t you Underdog?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m really okay at. But while we\u2019re at it, we need to talk about rules. For example, I don\u2019t want you to kiss me anymore.\u201d</p><p>TJ let his feet drag against the mulch until he was still, \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s not like I want to either. My head still kinda hurts from earlier, I don\u2019t want to get any more concussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. But we should write this all down,\u201d Cyrus started to scribble in his notebook. He neatly writes Contract on the top of the page before skipping down and placing \u2018No Kissing\u2019 next to the first bullet point.</p><p>TJ tried to look over, nearly falling out of the swing, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of writing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor proof. Just in case we break a rule and one of use tries to claim that it wasn\u2019t on there.\u201d</p><p>TJ let out a breathy laugh, \u201cOkay, but I doubt anyone is going to believe we\u2019re a couple if I can\u2019t touch you. Again, kissing is kind of a big couple thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of other ways to show that you care about a person that doesn\u2019t involve PDA,\u201d Cyrus nervously bites the bottom of his lip. PDA would help sell their story faster though, and this thing wasn\u2019t supposed to last too long. No! He couldn\u2019t get distracted.</p><p>\u201cWell no one\u2019s going to believe that I turned into a saint to date you,\u201d TJ huffed, \u201cYou gotta let me do something. How about I put my hand in the back pocket of your jeans?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyebrows scrunched up in concern, \u201cI don\u2019t wear jeans that often. Mostly khakis or corduroys.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed at that. The jean thing was so not the point, \u201cWell do they have back pockets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Cyrus turned got up off of the swing and turned his head back as far as he could. He was wearing a pair of his favorite khakis right now. He thinks he saw a pocket, but it was hard to tell and with the notebook and pencil in his hand he didn\u2019t want to fumble to reach and check, \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ shook his head, \u201cThey do. So I can do that, strictly as a business thing.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods and sits back down to write it in the notebook \u2018TJ can put his hand in Cyrus\u2019 back pocket\u2019. \u201cBut no kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me remind you that you started that whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I just wish that I could do that for real, you know?\u201d Cyrus sighs and halts his writing, \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that before, it\u2019s probably why I banged out heads together. Sorry about that. I just thought that the first time I\u2019d get to do all this stuff I\u2019d actually be dating someone who liked me. And who I liked just as much back. This situation isn\u2019t exactly ideal for all these firsts.\u201d</p><p>TJ seemed to take a moment to process all of it, nodding slowly, \u201cOkay. So we can save some things for you to do. For when this is all real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t want to steal all of your firsts,\u201d TJ\u2019s laugh was light and he gave Cyrus a sly look, \u201cI already have your first kiss.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could tell that TJ was trying to lighten the mood. He was trying to be nice and considerate. Go figure.</p><p>\u201cSo that also means that I won\u2019t pay for anything,\u201d TJ shrugged and started swinging again, the creaks from the old chains made him have to talk a bit louder, \u201cSomeone who really likes you can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to pay for my own stuff anyways,\u201d Cyrus frowned at that, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anything from you.\u201d</p><p>TJ didn\u2019t pay any mind to it, \u201cI won\u2019t walk you to class, or buy you flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied curtly, \u201cWas there anything the you and Kip did that was special?\u201d</p><p>TJ came to an abrupt halt, staring down at his hands, \u201cNotes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d TJ shook his head in an annoyed manner, \u201cHe made me write him all these notes. I don\u2019t understand why, my handwriting isn\u2019t \u00a0the best and it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t text each other.\u201d</p><p>But Cyrus could understand why Kip would want notes. They were sweet because it did require some sort of effort to write them. And it was something he could just stare at and hold and keep close to his chest. Something he could re-read on a bad day just as a pick me up kind of thing. It was hard cold proof that TJ cared about him, loved him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you one everyday,\u201d TJ said suddenly, a confident and bright smile on his face, \u201cIt\u2019ll drive him crazy.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nods and writes it down, \u2018TJ will write Cyrus a note (everyday?)\u2019</p><p>\u201cAlso write down that you have to come to some parties with me,\u201d TJ adds, pointing down at the notebook, \u201cAnd no weird Sci-fi movies unless it\u2019s something cool like Star Wars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offended by that nerd stereotype,\u201d Cyrus glared up at him, \u201cI don\u2019t watch only Sci-fi movies.\u201d</p><p>TJ clicks his tongue, \u201cOh yeah I forgot. You like to watch those lizard documentaries right? Well none of those either, unless you want me to fall asleep on you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was honestly too shocked that TJ remembered that detail about him to really care. He\u2019d probably make TJ watch one anyways, and then maybe he\u2019d see how amazing they were.</p><p>Suddenly TJ is grabbing the pencil and notebook from his hands, writing down \u2018Cyrus will make a picture of TJ his phone background. Cyrus snatched it back, \u201cYou too!\u201d He pulled his phone out quickly to try and catch TJ off guard, \u201cSay cheese!\u201d</p><p>He still looks unfairly handsome in the picture. A nice and light smile on his lips and his eyes filled with amusement. The higher powers were really unfair sometimes. </p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d TJ points his camera in Cyrus\u2019 direction and snaps a quick photo. He sits there for a moment, looking it over and fiddling with his phone to set it as his wallpaper, \u201cCute.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tried not to blush, but he know he lost that battle when the heat hit his cheeks. Out of all the damn things that happened, this was the thing that made him blush the most? \u201cOkay, last rule. We can tell absolutely no one about this. No one. If Buffy or Andi found out what I was doing, they\u2019d be so mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst rule of fight club.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just nodded like he understood the reference. He\u2019d have to google it later. He sighed, \u201cWhat about an end date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a deadline. How long are we going to do this for? A week? Month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just see where it goes?\u201d TJ shrugs like it\u2019s no big deal. </p><p>Cyrus started to stumble over his words, \u201cBut- If we don\u2019t have something set- I just feel like-\u201d</p><p>TJ laughs and cuts him off, grabbing the chains attached to Cyrus\u2019 swing, \u201cCyrus, you have to just relax. Not everything has to be planned down to a T. Go with the flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice from the great TJ Kippen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here all week,\u201d TJ jokes back, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nods a bit before stopping himself, \u201cOkay but we have to be over by Christmas. Too many relatives come around and I hate lying to all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely have no problem by then,\u201d TJ said confidently. Like he always does.</p><p>They both sign on the lines that Cyrus drew, sealing the contract. There was no going back now.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus hopped off the swing, \u201cI should get going.\u201d</p><p>TJ agreed and started walking back towards the school, confused when Cyrus started walking in the opposite direction, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Cyrus perked up, confused. He just wanted to pull out his earbuds and walk home in peace.</p><p>TJ tilted his head, \u201cYou\u2019re walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my car remember?\u201d Cyrus raised an inquisitive eyebrow, \u201cI\u2019ve been walking everywhere. It\u2019s actually been quite a good work out. Buffy is not happy about the fact that we have to walk to school now though.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled, \u201cWell I could give you a ride home if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Cyrus declined politely, \u201cThere is no way that I\u2019m ever going to get into that death trap of a car you have. All of my friends and I agreed that we would never buy a car that doesn\u2019t have at least seven safety features.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d TJ shrugged and walked off. </p><p>Cyrus plugged his earbuds in and started the rest of his walk home. He was almost out of the park until he hit the entrance by the small pond. Jonah. Jonah was there playing frisbee with some person he couldn\u2019t remember the name of. It seemed like Jonah noticed him too because he started to wave Cyrus over.</p><p>\u201cHey Cy-guy! What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much!\u201d Cyrus smiled back, \u201cGuess what? TJ and I aren\u2019t broken up. It was a just big misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Jonah\u2019s face scrunched up in thought for a split second, concern in his eyes. But it disappeared just as quickly as it had appeared, replaced with the signature Jonah Beck smile, \u201cThat\u2019s great news! I\u2019m happy for you. If he ever does anything though, you can always count on me to rough him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary,\u201d Cyrus nervously laughed, \u201cBut thanks for the thought.\u201d</p><p>Jonah shrugged, \u201cIt was kind of an empty threat anyways, I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019d last in a fight. I better get back to practice though, talk later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Cyrus watched as Jonah waved and skipped back over to the guy he had been throwing with. Now that Jonah knew for a fact that Cyrus wasn\u2019t in love with him and that he was with TJ now, maybe things would go back to normal. Like the stupid letter never happened. </p><p>He was so happy that the plan was working that he couldn\u2019t stop smiling all night. And he must have still been smiling the next morning too because Buffy nugged him on the walk to school, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the weird smile Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d Cyrus mumbled before clapping his hands together, \u201cJust thinking about stuff.\u201d</p><p>Buffy scrunched her nose up, her voice laced with thinly veiled disgust, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>Which was good, because he wasn\u2019t telling. The weather was cold, as is it normally is in the middle of fall. Cyrus was wrapped up in a navy cable knit sweater and his dark gray peacoat. He had accidentally forgot his gloves but he had a nice, puffy white knit scarf and his trusty black beanie on to make up for the loss. It was weather like this that made him wish that he liked driving. He knew Buffy wasn\u2019t too pleased to be waddling around in fall layers either, but she complained less once she saw exactly how distressed Cyrus seemed.</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d Buffy whispered suddenly, pulling him out of his thoughts, \u201cDon\u2019t make it obvious, but look. Is that car following us?\u201d</p><p>He had to resist the urge to panic and whip his head around. He slowly looked, yes that van was slowly creeping on them. Should he run? Did they have time to run? Buffy probably could escape but what could he do? He little legs were basically useless!</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to figure it out because the car pulled up next to them and the window rolled down. Cyrus squeezed his eyes shut and blocked his face with his hands, squeaking out, \u201cPlease I have nothing valuable don\u2019t kidnap me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises Underdog, you\u2019re looking pretty adorable in that scarf,\u201d He cracked an eye open and saw TJ behind the wheel. Of a minivan. The definition of a soccer mom car. The two on the sidewalk must have been staring for a second too long because he rolled his eyes and pointed to the back door, \u201cAre you guys getting in or?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you driving?\u201d Buffy asked, laughing in shock as she climbed in to the back, motioning for Cyrus to take the front.</p><p>\u201cA mini-van Buffy,\u201d TJ gave her a pointed look in the mirror, smirking, \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Buffy buckled in, \u201cI just wasn\u2019t aware that you knew how to drive something other than that accident on wheels.\u201d</p><p>Once Cyrus was in the car, the door slamming, TJ smiled, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too,\u201d Cyrus said, unsure of what to say, \u201cThanks for driving us.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting the car back into drive, \u201cWhat kind of boyfriend would I be if I let you walk all the way in the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is really for real?\u201d Buffy leaned forward, poking her head between the two seats, \u201cFor some reason this all still feels like a freakish dream. Or a nightmare, I\u2019m trying to pick between the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were friends Buffy,\u201d TJ offered an exaggerated pout, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Buffy huffed, \u201cWatch it Kippen. I will snap your neck if Cyrus so much as frowns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t happen Driscoll,\u201d TJ said, easily taking one of Cyrus\u2019 hands off of the middle consol, lacing their fingers together slowly for show, \u201cI am the perfect boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Buffy let out a loud snort, \u201cHa! Perfect my ass TJ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d TJ said, Buffy slightly flinching at the words, \u201cCyrus is the perfect boyfriend. Aren\u2019t you muffin?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus pulled their hands into his lap, tempted to swipe his hand away, \u201cI\u2019m not getting involved this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut thanks,\u201d Buffy said reluctantly, \u201cFor the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d TJ lets a small smile slip out.</p><p>Cyrus could live like this. Maybe. He still felt bad about lying to his best friends, but this. This felt normal. It felt nostalgic. It felt right. They haven\u2019t all hung out in so long, and he missed it. Even if Buffy and TJ argued a lot. It didn\u2019t stop his stomach from dropping once he realize that it would all be gone within the next month. Would he and TJ still even be friends after all of this? Or would it all go back? Cyrus hoped that they would still talk. He didn\u2019t realize how much he missed it until they started again.</p><hr><p>Thanks so much for reading! If you want to be on the tag list lemme know!

It did not take that long for Cyrus to find out what it would be like when everyone stared at him. It was even more staring and whispering than the morning that Cyrus jumped him, which he didn&rsquo;t think was possible.<b><br /></b></p><p>TJ sighed, mouth pulled into an amused smile, &ldquo;Relax. Stop acting as if I&rsquo;m a bomb.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard when you just&hellip; did that!&rdquo; Cyrus protested, hands a bit sweaty, &ldquo;Who just does that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who just jumps on someone and kisses them?&rdquo; TJ countered and Cyrus shut his mouth.</p><p>Cyrus hasn&rsquo;t had much experience in the hand holding department. He used to boast about being the first one of his friends to hold someone else&rsquo;s hand, but that didn&rsquo;t mean he was actually an expert. It wasn&rsquo;t helping that nearly the entire student body was watching him fail terribly at the simple act. It had officially spread to everyone.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Cyrus could see Denise Ackerman staring at them. Her mouth fell open and her eyebrows raised as if she couldn&rsquo;t believe her own eyes. Denise was Kip&rsquo;s best friend. His number one lacky. Cyrus was about to pull away at that look alone when TJ leaned closer to whisper in his ear, pointing at her with their interlocked fingers, &ldquo;Take a picture, it&rsquo;d last longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus felt bad for laughing at that and quickly slapped his free hand over his mouth. TJ let out a laugh too and pulled his hand down, &ldquo;Stop. It&rsquo;s okay to laugh, you don&rsquo;t have to be embarrassed, you have a cute laugh.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just nods and puts his hand down while TJ turns to talk to a someone in the hall, gesturing wildly with his freehand. Cyrus felt normal, which was abnormal. He was holding hands with a boy, his boyfriend. He had a boyfriend he was just casually holding hands with! Well, a fake one but still. Maybe Cyrus was a natural at this whole thing. </p><p>But then Cyrus starts to freak out again as TJ&rsquo;s friend turns to face him, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Cyrus right? TJ&rsquo;s new boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah!&rdquo; Cyrus squeaks out. Damn it Cyrus, Kip probably never lost his cool around TJ&rsquo;s friends. He cleared his throat and tried again, &ldquo;Yeah. He&rsquo;s my boyfriend. The guy I&rsquo;m dating. Don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;d be without him haha! Probably falling down a flight of stairs or something since I have two left feet! Or maybe-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, he is kinda funny,&rdquo; The guy starts laughing and nods at TJ.</p><p>TJ gives one last smile before he tugs Cyrus in the direction of Cyrus&rsquo; locker. Once they were safely there, without anymore pit stops or too prolonged stares, they let go of eachother. Cyrus nervously fiddled with his lock, tugging it open on the third try. When he turned around, TJ had been standing too close and their heads bumped loudly. TJ rubbed at the stinging spot, &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why were you standing so close to me?&rdquo; Cyrus scowled at the pain, eyes watering a bit. He could swear he was seeing stars. Fuckin&rsquo; A that hurt a lot.</p><p>TJ rolled his eyes, &ldquo;I was trying to kiss you, duh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cyrus looked at him incredulously. Why would he try doing that? Was that a thing they were going to have to try to do?</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dating Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ felt like he was talking to a six year old, &ldquo;Kissing is kind of a thing couples do.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus can&rsquo;t do that. Not without exploding. He&rsquo;d never get used to that kind of affection right off the bat, it was too much lying. Cause then he&rsquo;d not only be lying to everyone around them, but he&rsquo;d have to start lying to himself. He&rsquo;d have to tell himself that it didn&rsquo;t bother him that none of it meant anything, because even if it was all fake the intimacy was real. He wanted to have something like that, but for real.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to talk about that,&rdquo; Cyrus put a hand on TJ&rsquo;s chest, pushing him away a tiny bit, &ldquo;Come up with some rules.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rules?&rdquo; TJ snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus closes his locker and slips out from the way TJ had boxed him in, &ldquo;Rules and boundaries and the story. You know?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughed as he caught up to him, &ldquo;Okay, fine. It might be good so you don&rsquo;t back out on all of this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Cyrus waved him off as if the thought hadn&rsquo;t crossed his mind about 50 times since he agreed to do it, &ldquo;Who do you take me for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you were thinking about it Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ said like he was sure of it, &ldquo;I can see you coming up with one hundred and one excuses not to do it already.&rdquo;</p><p>How was he so sure? He was right, but how was he so sure of himself? The confidence on the guy was outstanding.</p><p>Cyrus was looking around for a place to talk but all around them there were other students who were whispering behind hands and shifting their eyes between them. They couldn&rsquo;t talk there, there were too many people around. Too many people that could find out the truth.</p><p>He must have been straying pretty far away from the school unconsciously because TJ suddenly tugged on his arm, &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The park,&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; mouth moved before his brain was able to process what he was saying, &ldquo;No one from school will be there.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ seemed to accept this explanation and followed him diligently. Cyrus was too busy trying to come up with what he wanted to say to be paying attention to where he was going. His pace slowed does and he was looking down at his feet in a daze, caught up in his thoughts. TJ ended up dragging them the rest of the way there, stopping at the old swing set, &ldquo;The swings TJ?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; He let his backpack drop to the ground, &ldquo;We used to come here all the time together. It seemed appropriate.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was surprised he remembered something from almost four years ago now, but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from sitting down and dragging his feet. He had pulled out his notebook and a pencil, &ldquo;Okay. So first I think we should come up with how we got together. If we don&rsquo;t have matching stories people will be able to tell we&rsquo;re faking right away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seems reasonable,&rdquo; TJ was pumping his legs a little, making sure not to go too high so they could still talk, &ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus seemed to smile at that, the romantic in him was giddy, &ldquo;How about this. You found me after I crashed my car and comforted me. You decided to wait with me until the tow truck came and you decided to drive me home, you were all nervous. You wrung your hands because you&rsquo;ve kinda been into me since middle school,&rdquo; Cyrus clasped his hands together and lowered his voice a ridiculous amount, &ldquo;Oh Cyrus! How I love thee. And since I was your first kiss you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know if you were my first kiss?&rdquo; TJ interrupted.</p><p>Cyrus continued without paying any attention to his comment, &ldquo;Since I was your first kiss you&rsquo;ve always thought there was something special there. You had to take a chance so you did because you&rsquo;re 95% confidence and 5% hair gel and we started dating ever since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one is going to believe that,&rdquo; TJ shook his head, &ldquo;Especially not Kip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The best lies are the ones closest to the truth, TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus said in a matter of fact tone, &ldquo;We did kiss in middle school. It was a first for at least one of us. And you did stop when I got into that accident.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s just that I went to see Kip that day,&rdquo; TJ raised an eyebrow, &ldquo;Remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay minor detail,&rdquo; Cyrus waved it off, &ldquo;I was in your head when you went to go see Kip and when he broke it off you took it as a sign. So then you rushed right over to my house with flowers and asked me out on my front porch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the all figured out, don&rsquo;t you Underdog?&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus nodded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;m really okay at. But while we&rsquo;re at it, we need to talk about rules. For example, I don&rsquo;t want you to kiss me anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ let his feet drag against the mulch until he was still, &ldquo;Trust me, it&rsquo;s not like I want to either. My head still kinda hurts from earlier, I don&rsquo;t want to get any more concussions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very funny. But we should write this all down,&rdquo; Cyrus started to scribble in his notebook. He neatly writes Contract on the top of the page before skipping down and placing &lsquo;No Kissing&rsquo; next to the first bullet point.</p><p>TJ tried to look over, nearly falling out of the swing, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of writing it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For proof. Just in case we break a rule and one of use tries to claim that it wasn&rsquo;t on there.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ let out a breathy laugh, &ldquo;Okay, but I doubt anyone is going to believe we&rsquo;re a couple if I can&rsquo;t touch you. Again, kissing is kind of a big couple thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are plenty of other ways to show that you care about a person that doesn&rsquo;t involve PDA,&rdquo; Cyrus nervously bites the bottom of his lip. PDA would help sell their story faster though, and this thing wasn&rsquo;t supposed to last too long. No! He couldn&rsquo;t get distracted.</p><p>&ldquo;Well no one&rsquo;s going to believe that I turned into a saint to date you,&rdquo; TJ huffed, &ldquo;You gotta let me do something. How about I put my hand in the back pocket of your jeans?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyebrows scrunched up in concern, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wear jeans that often. Mostly khakis or corduroys.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughed at that. The jean thing was so not the point, &ldquo;Well do they have back pockets?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Cyrus turned got up off of the swing and turned his head back as far as he could. He was wearing a pair of his favorite khakis right now. He thinks he saw a pocket, but it was hard to tell and with the notebook and pencil in his hand he didn&rsquo;t want to fumble to reach and check, &ldquo;Right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; TJ shook his head, &ldquo;They do. So I can do that, strictly as a business thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nods and sits back down to write it in the notebook &lsquo;TJ can put his hand in Cyrus&rsquo; back pocket&rsquo;. &ldquo;But no kissing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me remind you that you started that whole thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I just wish that I could do that for real, you know?&rdquo; Cyrus sighs and halts his writing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done anything like that before, it&rsquo;s probably why I banged out heads together. Sorry about that. I just thought that the first time I&rsquo;d get to do all this stuff I&rsquo;d actually be dating someone who liked me. And who I liked just as much back. This situation isn&rsquo;t exactly ideal for all these firsts.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ seemed to take a moment to process all of it, nodding slowly, &ldquo;Okay. So we can save some things for you to do. For when this is all real.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. I don&rsquo;t want to steal all of your firsts,&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s laugh was light and he gave Cyrus a sly look, &ldquo;I already have your first kiss.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus could tell that TJ was trying to lighten the mood. He was trying to be nice and considerate. Go figure.</p><p>&ldquo;So that also means that I won&rsquo;t pay for anything,&rdquo; TJ shrugged and started swinging again, the creaks from the old chains made him have to talk a bit louder, &ldquo;Someone who really likes you can do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was going to pay for my own stuff anyways,&rdquo; Cyrus frowned at that, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t expecting anything from you.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ didn&rsquo;t pay any mind to it, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t walk you to class, or buy you flowers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get it TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus replied curtly, &ldquo;Was there anything the you and Kip did that was special?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ came to an abrupt halt, staring down at his hands, &ldquo;Notes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Notes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; TJ shook his head in an annoyed manner, &ldquo;He made me write him all these notes. I don&rsquo;t understand why, my handwriting isn&rsquo;t &nbsp;the best and it&rsquo;s not like we didn&rsquo;t text each other.&rdquo;</p><p>But Cyrus could understand why Kip would want notes. They were sweet because it did require some sort of effort to write them. And it was something he could just stare at and hold and keep close to his chest. Something he could re-read on a bad day just as a pick me up kind of thing. It was hard cold proof that TJ cared about him, loved him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write you one everyday,&rdquo; TJ said suddenly, a confident and bright smile on his face, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll drive him crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just nods and writes it down, &lsquo;TJ will write Cyrus a note (everyday?)&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Also write down that you have to come to some parties with me,&rdquo; TJ adds, pointing down at the notebook, &ldquo;And no weird Sci-fi movies unless it&rsquo;s something cool like Star Wars.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m offended by that nerd stereotype,&rdquo; Cyrus glared up at him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t watch only Sci-fi movies.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ clicks his tongue, &ldquo;Oh yeah I forgot. You like to watch those lizard documentaries right? Well none of those either, unless you want me to fall asleep on you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was honestly too shocked that TJ remembered that detail about him to really care. He&rsquo;d probably make TJ watch one anyways, and then maybe he&rsquo;d see how amazing they were.</p><p>Suddenly TJ is grabbing the pencil and notebook from his hands, writing down &lsquo;Cyrus will make a picture of TJ his phone background. Cyrus snatched it back, &ldquo;You too!&rdquo; He pulled his phone out quickly to try and catch TJ off guard, &ldquo;Say cheese!&rdquo;</p><p>He still looks unfairly handsome in the picture. A nice and light smile on his lips and his eyes filled with amusement. The higher powers were really unfair sometimes. </p><p>&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; TJ points his camera in Cyrus&rsquo; direction and snaps a quick photo. He sits there for a moment, looking it over and fiddling with his phone to set it as his wallpaper, &ldquo;Cute.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus tried not to blush, but he know he lost that battle when the heat hit his cheeks. Out of all the damn things that happened, this was the thing that made him blush the most? &ldquo;Okay, last rule. We can tell absolutely no one about this. No one. If Buffy or Andi found out what I was doing, they&rsquo;d be so mad at me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First rule of fight club.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just nodded like he understood the reference. He&rsquo;d have to google it later. He sighed, &ldquo;What about an end date.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like a deadline. How long are we going to do this for? A week? Month?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just see where it goes?&rdquo; TJ shrugs like it&rsquo;s no big deal. </p><p>Cyrus started to stumble over his words, &ldquo;But- If we don&rsquo;t have something set- I just feel like-&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughs and cuts him off, grabbing the chains attached to Cyrus&rsquo; swing, &ldquo;Cyrus, you have to just relax. Not everything has to be planned down to a T. Go with the flow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Advice from the great TJ Kippen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here all week,&rdquo; TJ jokes back, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nods a bit before stopping himself, &ldquo;Okay but we have to be over by Christmas. Too many relatives come around and I hate lying to all of them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll definitely have no problem by then,&rdquo; TJ said confidently. Like he always does.</p><p>They both sign on the lines that Cyrus drew, sealing the contract. There was no going back now.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cyrus hopped off the swing, &ldquo;I should get going.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ agreed and started walking back towards the school, confused when Cyrus started walking in the opposite direction, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Home?&rdquo; Cyrus perked up, confused. He just wanted to pull out his earbuds and walk home in peace.</p><p>TJ tilted his head, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re walking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, my car remember?&rdquo; Cyrus raised an inquisitive eyebrow, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking everywhere. It&rsquo;s actually been quite a good work out. Buffy is not happy about the fact that we have to walk to school now though.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckled, &ldquo;Well I could give you a ride home if you need.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; Cyrus declined politely, &ldquo;There is no way that I&rsquo;m ever going to get into that death trap of a car you have. All of my friends and I agreed that we would never buy a car that doesn&rsquo;t have at least seven safety features.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; TJ shrugged and walked off. </p><p>Cyrus plugged his earbuds in and started the rest of his walk home. He was almost out of the park until he hit the entrance by the small pond. Jonah. Jonah was there playing frisbee with some person he couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of. It seemed like Jonah noticed him too because he started to wave Cyrus over.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Cy-guy! What are you up to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing much!&rdquo; Cyrus smiled back, &ldquo;Guess what? TJ and I aren&rsquo;t broken up. It was a just big misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah&rsquo;s face scrunched up in thought for a split second, concern in his eyes. But it disappeared just as quickly as it had appeared, replaced with the signature Jonah Beck smile, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great news! I&rsquo;m happy for you. If he ever does anything though, you can always count on me to rough him up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that will be necessary,&rdquo; Cyrus nervously laughed, &ldquo;But thanks for the thought.&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah shrugged, &ldquo;It was kind of an empty threat anyways, I&rsquo;m not sure how long I&rsquo;d last in a fight. I better get back to practice though, talk later?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Cyrus watched as Jonah waved and skipped back over to the guy he had been throwing with. Now that Jonah knew for a fact that Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t in love with him and that he was with TJ now, maybe things would go back to normal. Like the stupid letter never happened. </p><p>He was so happy that the plan was working that he couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling all night. And he must have still been smiling the next morning too because Buffy nugged him on the walk to school, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the weird smile Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh nothing,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled before clapping his hands together, &ldquo;Just thinking about stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy scrunched her nose up, her voice laced with thinly veiled disgust, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna know.&rdquo;</p><p>Which was good, because he wasn&rsquo;t telling. The weather was cold, as is it normally is in the middle of fall. Cyrus was wrapped up in a navy cable knit sweater and his dark gray peacoat. He had accidentally forgot his gloves but he had a nice, puffy white knit scarf and his trusty black beanie on to make up for the loss. It was weather like this that made him wish that he liked driving. He knew Buffy wasn&rsquo;t too pleased to be waddling around in fall layers either, but she complained less once she saw exactly how distressed Cyrus seemed.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; Buffy whispered suddenly, pulling him out of his thoughts, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it obvious, but look. Is that car following us?&rdquo;</p><p>He had to resist the urge to panic and whip his head around. He slowly looked, yes that van was slowly creeping on them. Should he run? Did they have time to run? Buffy probably could escape but what could he do? He little legs were basically useless!</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t have time to figure it out because the car pulled up next to them and the window rolled down. Cyrus squeezed his eyes shut and blocked his face with his hands, squeaking out, &ldquo;Please I have nothing valuable don&rsquo;t kidnap me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No promises Underdog, you&rsquo;re looking pretty adorable in that scarf,&rdquo; He cracked an eye open and saw TJ behind the wheel. Of a minivan. The definition of a soccer mom car. The two on the sidewalk must have been staring for a second too long because he rolled his eyes and pointed to the back door, &ldquo;Are you guys getting in or?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you driving?&rdquo; Buffy asked, laughing in shock as she climbed in to the back, motioning for Cyrus to take the front.</p><p>&ldquo;A mini-van Buffy,&rdquo; TJ gave her a pointed look in the mirror, smirking, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never heard of one?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I have,&rdquo; Buffy buckled in, &ldquo;I just wasn&rsquo;t aware that you knew how to drive something other than that accident on wheels.&rdquo;</p><p>Once Cyrus was in the car, the door slamming, TJ smiled, &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning to you too,&rdquo; Cyrus said, unsure of what to say, &ldquo;Thanks for driving us.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shrugged, putting the car back into drive, &ldquo;What kind of boyfriend would I be if I let you walk all the way in the cold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So this is really for real?&rdquo; Buffy leaned forward, poking her head between the two seats, &ldquo;For some reason this all still feels like a freakish dream. Or a nightmare, I&rsquo;m trying to pick between the two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought we were friends Buffy,&rdquo; TJ offered an exaggerated pout, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy huffed, &ldquo;Watch it Kippen. I will snap your neck if Cyrus so much as frowns.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t happen Driscoll,&rdquo; TJ said, easily taking one of Cyrus&rsquo; hands off of the middle consol, lacing their fingers together slowly for show, &ldquo;I am the perfect boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy let out a loud snort, &ldquo;Ha! Perfect my ass TJ!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; TJ said, Buffy slightly flinching at the words, &ldquo;Cyrus is the perfect boyfriend. Aren&rsquo;t you muffin?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus pulled their hands into his lap, tempted to swipe his hand away, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting involved this time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But thanks,&rdquo; Buffy said reluctantly, &ldquo;For the ride.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem,&rdquo; TJ lets a small smile slip out.</p><p>Cyrus could live like this. Maybe. He still felt bad about lying to his best friends, but this. This felt normal. It felt nostalgic. It felt right. They haven&rsquo;t all hung out in so long, and he missed it. Even if Buffy and TJ argued a lot. It didn&rsquo;t stop his stomach from dropping once he realize that it would all be gone within the next month. Would he and TJ still even be friends after all of this? Or would it all go back? Cyrus hoped that they would still talk. He didn&rsquo;t realize how much he missed it until they started again.</p><hr /><p>Thanks so much for reading! If you want to be on the tag list lemme know!
