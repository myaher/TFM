Awe I love you large amount as well and I hope you enjoy this little drabble thing \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc96</p>\n\n<p>Getting Harry out of bed can be rather difficult if he\u2019s in the mood to have a long lazy cuddle with you that last until the both of your tummy\u2019s growl. He will pout and he will try to make his grip on your as tight as he could when you start to wiggle away from him so you can go start breakfast, even then he is right behind you with his chin on your shoulder and his hands on your waist as he watches you because the only way he was getting out of bed was \u201cif I can watch you cook, M\u2019not movin if I can\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Most of the time he\u2019s a little more easier since he is quite the morning person, so when the alarm goes off you\u2019ll roll over and see his eyes are already open and a sleepy little smile is on his face. He still wants a few moments to just hold you and get mentally prepared for the day and this normally includes him mumbling the days plans into your ear as he pulls your back flush with his front. \u201cBest part of the day is this,\u201d his voice is deep from just waking up and the kisses he placed on your neck make you giggle. \u201cCan\u2019t start the day without cuddles.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>While other times when you wake up you\u2019ll turn over and see the bed is empty, you won\u2019t have to pout and worry for long though because Harry will walk into the bedroom with his gym clothes on and it\u2019ll all make sense. He often wakes up way before you even think of opening your eyes on the days he goes to the gym or for a run, he likes to go when the city is still quiet and most people are still asleep warm in their beds. You will automatically know what about to happen when he gives you a cheeky little grin and before you can even react he is laying on top of you and peppering kisses all over your face while his damp hair falls from where he had it pushed back making it tickle your cheeks when he\u2019s kissing your nose. \u201cMissed you my love. Didn\u2019t mean to be gone so long was trying to sneak back into bed before you woke up.\u201d His voice would be muffled by the hoodie that the two of your were working on getting off of his body making you laugh when he finally pulled it off and tossed it to the side of the room. \u201cYou need a shower.\u201d With that he\u2019d be off of you just long enough to grab your hands and pull you out of bed and led you to the bathroom. </p>\n\n<p><br/>\nThen there is the time that he first comes home from tour or a long trip overseas and when your alarm goes off Harry doesn\u2019t even flinch because he\u2019s in a deep sleep. You don\u2019t bother waking him or even trying to because you know he needs his rest or he will be grumpy and grouchy all day and you just don\u2019t like dealing with that. You gently place a kiss to his cheek before climbing out of bed, the noise of the floorboards creaking making him stir a bit but not open his eyes. On mornings like this you know better than to let him sleep well into the day because he likes to try to get back on his regular sleeping schedule so you wait until around ten in the morning to go and try to pry him out of bed. Mornings like this normally end up with you opening all the curtains and windows allowing the natural light to come into the room and shine on him making him roll onto his tummy and hide his face in a pillow making you laugh as you pull the covers down to the foot of the bed causing a groan to escape him as you leave to head into the kitchen. You\u2019re well aware that he\u2019s in the process of waking up so you begin making his breakfast and the smell of eggs and his coffee will make him slowly trudge his way into the kitchen. \ud83d\udc96</p>",

Awe I love you large amount as well and I hope you enjoy this little drabble thing \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc96</p>\n\n<p>Getting Harry out of bed can be rather difficult if he\u2019s in the mood to have a long lazy cuddle with you that last until the both of your tummy\u2019s growl. He will pout and he will try to make his grip on your as tight as he could when you start to wiggle away from him so you can go start breakfast, even then he is right behind you with his chin on your shoulder and his hands on your waist as he watches you because the only way he was getting out of bed was \u201cif I can watch you cook, M\u2019not movin if I can\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Most of the time he\u2019s a little more easier since he is quite the morning person, so when the alarm goes off you\u2019ll roll over and see his eyes are already open and a sleepy little smile is on his face. He still wants a few moments to just hold you and get mentally prepared for the day and this normally includes him mumbling the days plans into your ear as he pulls your back flush with his front. \u201cBest part of the day is this,\u201d his voice is deep from just waking up and the kisses he placed on your neck make you giggle. \u201cCan\u2019t start the day without cuddles.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>While other times when you wake up you\u2019ll turn over and see the bed is empty, you won\u2019t have to pout and worry for long though because Harry will walk into the bedroom with his gym clothes on and it\u2019ll all make sense. He often wakes up way before you even think of opening your eyes on the days he goes to the gym or for a run, he likes to go when the city is still quiet and most people are still asleep warm in their beds. You will automatically know what about to happen when he gives you a cheeky little grin and before you can even react he is laying on top of you and peppering kisses all over your face while his damp hair falls from where he had it pushed back making it tickle your cheeks when he\u2019s kissing your nose. \u201cMissed you my love. Didn\u2019t mean to be gone so long was trying to sneak back into bed before you woke up.\u201d His voice would be muffled by the hoodie that the two of your were working on getting off of his body making you laugh when he finally pulled it off and tossed it to the side of the room. \u201cYou need a shower.\u201d With that he\u2019d be off of you just long enough to grab your hands and pull you out of bed and led you to the bathroom. </p>\n\n<p><br>\nThen there is the time that he first comes home from tour or a long trip overseas and when your alarm goes off Harry doesn\u2019t even flinch because he\u2019s in a deep sleep. You don\u2019t bother waking him or even trying to because you know he needs his rest or he will be grumpy and grouchy all day and you just don\u2019t like dealing with that. You gently place a kiss to his cheek before climbing out of bed, the noise of the floorboards creaking making him stir a bit but not open his eyes. On mornings like this you know better than to let him sleep well into the day because he likes to try to get back on his regular sleeping schedule so you wait until around ten in the morning to go and try to pry him out of bed. Mornings like this normally end up with you opening all the curtains and windows allowing the natural light to come into the room and shine on him making him roll onto his tummy and hide his face in a pillow making you laugh as you pull the covers down to the foot of the bed causing a groan to escape him as you leave to head into the kitchen. You\u2019re well aware that he\u2019s in the process of waking up so you begin making his breakfast and the smell of eggs and his coffee will make him slowly trudge his way into the kitchen. \ud83d\udc96</p>",

Not that you were actively hoping that she was exponentially less impressive or captivating in person, but you definitely never thought she\u2019d be able to live up to the flawless image of a woman that Harry had created in his endless fawning over her throughout the past few weeks. While he had initially come to you with a heart heavy with the fact that she allegedly claimed he \u201cwasn\u2019t her type\u201d, any little doubt anyone had harbored about her eventually falling to his charm was decidedly crushed at the vision of them standing hip-to-hip with his arm securely wrapped around her slim waist as they both laughed at whatever hilarious anecdote Mitch seemed to be reenacting in front of them. You, however, knew from the very beginning that they would end up together, because, well, with your luck, didn\u2019t they always?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not even that pretty,\u201d Nick commented, taking another lengthy sip of the bright blue cocktail the bartender had concocted from behind the bar at one of the most exclusive clubs in Beverly Hills. Both of you were leaning against said bar, sipping away at each of your drinks as you casually inspected Harry and his new girlfriend from across the dance floor as they mingled with the rest of Harry\u2019s band in a booth.\u00a0</p><p>Harry had made the decision to rent out the entire establishment in celebration of the fact that he had, just a couple weeks ago, concluded his first world tour as a solo artist. The numbers alone that the Harry Styles: Live on Tour expedition generated were mindblowing, and among the pain at seeing him so affectionate with his new girlfriend, you felt this immeasurable pride swell in your chest at the impact that this man was making on the world, a small stop in his venture to make the world a better place. Just the fact that he was able to donate over a million dollars to charities all around the world made you want to throw your own celebratory party for him with your own money (not that you were even close to being financially able to, but you know, it\u2019s the sentiment that counts).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGrimmy,\u201d you admonished, shoving your and Harry\u2019s friend lightly with a little laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged unabashedly, giving you a pointed look. \u201cJust sayin\u2019, Y/N. By the way he went on about her, I expected nothing short of a female Adonis on his arm tonight, and instead, I set eyes on this aspiring Instagram model who publicly celebrates every 10k follower milestone with a watered down shot of vodka on a livestream.\u201d</p><p>You gave Nick a dead stare, shaking your head slightly. \u201cThat was&hellip; oddly specific.\u201d You set down your drink on the counter behind you, slumping down onto one of the high stools. \u201cShe\u2019s <i>actually</i> a uni student studying criminal psychology as a junior at USC, and she spends more time volunteering at the animal shelter down the street from her apartment than she does taking vodka shots.\u201d You pause. \u201cAnd she only has 736 followers, so your Instagram theory is completely wrong on more than one level.\u201d</p><p>Nick blinked slowly, tilting his head to the side. \u201c<i>That</i> was oddly specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what Harry tells me,\u201d you muttered, grabbing your drink from the table and downing it all in one go. \u201cNot like <i>I </i>stalk her in my free time.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed heavily, downing his drink before lifting his hand to get the bartender\u2019s attention and ordering two palomas. \u201cListen, love, my point was that she isn\u2019t as eye-catching as H made her up to be.\u201d He thanked the bartender with a smile and a nod of gratitude before handing you a drink. \u201cOn any account, she\u2019s no match to <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, taking a small sip from your new cocktail before coughing at the burn it left sliding down your throat. \u201cThat is way too much tequila.\u201d</p><p>Nick took a sip in response, licking his teeth before shrugging lightly and continuing on with his original point. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t just tell \u2018im you\u2019re completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with him so you can move along with your happily ever after, missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019ll just casually walk up to him with a, \u2018<i>Hi, how are you, just dropping by to say how completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with you I am, have a nice day!</i>\u2019\u201d you said sarcastically, taking another tentative sip of your paloma.\u00a0</p><p>Nick scoffed. \u201cYou can do it with a little more class than that, Y/N.\u201d You narrowed your eyes at him, opening your mouth to respond but being cut off. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re so afraid of, love! He\u2019s obviously very smitten with your cute little self, or else he wouldn\u2019t have gone through all this trouble of procuring a cover-up girlfriend-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-to make it seem like he\u2019s completely in love with someone else, when in reality, he\u2019s just trying to draw you out with jealousy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am <i>not</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-before he finally confesses that he\u2019s been trying to get with your arse since he met you all those years ago and fell for the way your eyes are <i>\u2018deep and complex like a flowing river\u2019</i> or how the sheen of your hair <i>\u2018looks golden under the perfect natural lighting\u2019</i> or some Jane Austen-esque shit like that.\u201d</p><p>You reached out and hit Nick on the shoulder, careful not to jostle your drink around too much as he held up his hands in surrender. \u201cShut <i>up,</i> Nick!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in what appeared to be disbelief, taking a lengthy sip from his glass as if to prepare himself for what he was about to say to you. \u201cWhat is it that makes you think he doesn\u2019t feel the same way? Is it the family? Anne not fancy you much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Anne lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Gem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, <i>you </i>like me so-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not like <i>him </i>enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the fame? Spotlight too much for ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, don\u2019t be-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I got it</i>. It\u2019s the Gucci, eh? Too lavish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, I swear to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should reconsider if it\u2019s the Gucci. His girlfriend at the mo\u2019 seems to be just fine with it. Honestly-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>That</i>,\u201d you interrupt loudly, setting your glass down on the table. \u201cThe <i>girlfriend</i>, Grim. It\u2019s the girlfriend part that makes me think he might not be as in love with me as I am with him. Call me crazy, but the last time I checked, you don\u2019t ask out someone if you\u2019ve fallen for someone else.\u201d</p><p>Nick paused, putting his drink next to yours on the table before leaning towards you and placing his hands on your legs as if to prove he\u2019s serious now. \u201cBabes, I am one of his best mates. Believe me when I say that what he feels for her doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to even an ounce of love I\u2019ve seen he has for you.\u201d His grip on you tightened, eyes boring into yours with an intensity so rare for someone as playful and fun-loving as him. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of feeling so depressed? Ignored? <i>Loveless</i>?\u201d</p><p>You sighed deeply, Nick\u2019s words pulling at your heartstrings as you momentarily considered that maybe, just maybe, Harry felt more than what he\u2019s led on towards you, and you were being too ignorant to acknowledge it. \u201cI\u2019m not <i>loveless</i>, Nick.\u201d You shook your head, as if ridding any hopeful thought Nick had planted in your head. \u201cBesides, even if he did, at one point, like me back, it doesn\u2019t matter now. You said it yourself; he practically worships the ground Peyton walks on. Just because she\u2019s not as impressive as we thought she was, Harry obviously feels very strongly about her, or he would\u2019ve never talked about her the way he did.\u201d You paused, closing your eyes momentarily. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not a homewrecker, and I\u2019m not going to start just because I took too long to confess my feelings to him. As his best mate, and mine, you should respect that, Grimmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs one of your best friends, that is the reason why I can\u2019t just sit here and watch on as you pine after a man who would drop everything for you in a second,\u201d Nick insisted, cupping your face in his hands and leaning even closer. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for him, and Peyton? She\u2019s not it. You are what\u2019s best for him. And that is why&hellip;\u201d You watched as he shut his eyes, taking in a deep dramatic breath as if preparing for something huge. You felt your heart begin to beat faster, knowing that when Nick put his mind to something, it was next to impossible to convince him out of it. \u201cYou are going to talk to him. Tonight. Right now, actually.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed, reaching up to grasp his wrists and pull his hands away from your face. \u201cEven if I wanted to, what about Peyton?\u201d</p><p>A quick flash of a mischievous smirk flitted across his face, one of his eyes dropping into a cheeky wink. \u201cI\u2019ll handle her.\u201d</p><p>With that, Nick abruptly got up from the bar stool and began to dramatically scream out the words of the rap song currently pounding through the speakers, drunkenly swaying his hips from side to side as he pretended to stumble his way across the dance floor towards Harry and Peyton. You watched as their entire table\u2019s attention was captured by Nick\u2019s gyrating figure as he reached their table, serenading Peyton with what you were positive were the wrong words along with Kanye West. \u201c<i>Eighteen years, eighteen years, she got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years&hellip;</i>\u201d</p><p>Watching Nick embarrass himself for a moment more, you took a deep breath and closed your eyes, beginning a mental pep talk to hype yourself up before you went over there. \u2018<i>Nick went through all this trouble to get you to talk to him, so get up off your ass, stop being a little bitch, and just talk to him. It\u2019s just Harry. He\u2019s your best friend. What could possibly go wrong?</i>\u2019</p><p>For a shot of extra luck (quite literally), you downed the rest of your obscenely strong drink in one go and shook your head to clear the resulting fog from your vision before getting up and making your way towards them. You felt like you needed to walk with purpose, as this might\u2019ve been the prelude to a defining moment in your and Harry\u2019s relationship, the thing that kickstarts the rest of your lives together (or just the prologue to your depressing autobiography, whichever seemed more plausible). But you probably just looked like how David did when he first set eyes on Goliath.</p><p>As you approached, you noticed that Nick had seamlessly executed his plan at coercing Peyton away from Harry\u2019s side and out onto the dance floor, their retreating figures visible as Harry watched amusedly from his seat. Nick continued to scream out Kanye West lyrics, having moved on from simple swaying to a whole routine consisting of thrusting and rolling his hips while spinning in a slow circle, an odd combination loosely inspired by the Magic Mike routine you\u2019d both witnessed at the strip club he\u2019d dragged you to a few days prior (fortunately or unfortunately, it was a bit of a toss-up). Needless to say, Peyton was certainly occupied.</p><p>\u201cH?\u201d you asked tentatively, rocking onto the heels of your feet as Harry turned his attention away from his best friend now animatedly attempting to engage Peyton in dancing with him instead of laughing at him.\u00a0</p><p>Familiar green eyes settled on your face, your nervous smile considerably less enthusiastic than the bright grin that lit up Harry\u2019s face at the sight of you. Aside from the brief hug and introduction to his girlfriend at the beginning of the party, you hadn\u2019t had the chance to talk to him at all that night, instead choosing to drown yourself in a plethora of Nick\u2019s eclectic taste in cocktails up until this very moment.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he exclaimed, immediately sliding over to make room for you in the booth. You settled down next to him, his arm pulling you into a tight side embrace with a small peck on your temple. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been? I haven\u2019t seen you all night.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile at his show of affection, shrugging as if you hadn\u2019t been staring at him love on his girlfriend for the past three hours. \u201cYou\u2019re a busy man,\u201d you responded lightly, shoving him playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t have time for commoners like me anymore.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, cupping your face in his giant hands and lightly squeezing your cheeks. \u201cAlways have time for you, love.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, another person\u2019s voice breaks into your bubble with sarcastic offense. \u201c<i>Hi, Mitch. How are you, Mitch? Oh, I\u2019m doing great, Y/N, thank you so much for caring about literally anyone else but your lover boy over there.</i>\u201d</p><p>Your eyes flashed to Mitch, who you admittedly hadn\u2019t really paid much mind to until he spoke up. He had a smug smirk on his face, knowing his comment about your \u201clover boy\u201d was nearing dangerous territory of Harry getting suspicious. Then again, you were also well aware that Harry had been contentedly naive for however long you\u2019d been in love with him, with people like his entire band and Nick being privy to your affection and constantly pushing towards a very public confession.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShove off, Mitch,\u201d Harry laughed, throwing an arm on the back of the booth behind you. \u201cPeyton might hear you. Don\u2019t wanna get the missus upset, eh?\u201d</p><p>You felt yourself stiffen at the mention of his girlfriend, the impending confession weighing even heavier at the tip of your tongue. The familiar sensation of your heart cracking just a bit more made you slump down a bit in your seat, your smile transforming into a fake grimace. Your eyes met Mitch\u2019s across the table, and the sympathetic glance he sent your way didn\u2019t make you feel any better about what you were going to do. \u2018<i>Not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker&hellip;\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cY\u2019alright?\u201d Your attention was pulled back to the boy next to you, whose eyebrows were now furrowed in slight concern at your sudden shift in mood. It hurt just slightly knowing that he was so in tune with your emotions that he could detect the smallest changes in emotion in you, falsely convincing you that he just maybe paid as much attention to you as you did to him. \u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your lips into your mouth, a quick \u2018now or never\u2019 flitting through your head before you felt the words fall out of your mouth at a pace way faster than normal. \u201cActually, I need to talk t\u2019you about something.\u201d</p><p>The worry on his face just deepened at your response, turning his body towards you more and leaning in closer. \u201cSure, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;\u201d you hummed, suddenly very aware that you were sat in a very public club at a table with someone else that was most likely listening to every word you were saying. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda important.\u201d You glanced around the perimeter of the club, eyes flitting over the spiral staircase in the corner of the room that led up to what appeared to be a much more private area of the club. \u201cIs there somewhere more private we could talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Harry answered, grabbing your hand and pulling you up from your seat before gently ushering you out of the booth. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he called to Mitch, who had been distracted chatting with one of Harry\u2019s tour assistants that had just approached the table. Mitch nodded in return, locking eyes with you and winking subtly before turning away completely.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you made your way through the throng of his friends and colleagues dancing closely together to the beat of whatever new rap song the DJ had blaring through the speakers, Harry briefly being stopped multiple times by congratulations as he caught the attention of almost everyone you passed. He quickly thanked them, shaking hands with a few and halting completely to embrace others while you stood quietly behind him, silently giving yourself a mental pep talk about the best way to go about what you had to tell him. After all, there isn\u2019t really a \u201cConfessing You\u2019re In Love with Someone for Dummies\u201d to help you out.</p><p>Once you both broke out of the crowd, Harry took a loose hold of your hand again and pulled you towards the spiral staircase you had spotted earlier, checking behind him one last time before beginning to climb the steps two at a time with his long legs. As you ascended the stairs behind him, you glanced back down onto the club laid out under you, catching Nick\u2019s eyes as he continued to dance with Peyton and sending him a wide-eyed look of panic. He grinned back, sending you a thumbs-up and mouthing a \u201cgood luck\u201d before Harry pulled you up onto the second floor and Nick fell out of view.\u00a0</p><p>You faced a long, quiet hallway extending from both sides of the staircase, the floor lined with a deep red velvet carpet that cushioned yours and Harry\u2019s steps so that neither could be heard as he continued to lead you into the first room to your right.\u00a0</p><p>It was what appeared to be a room reserved for private parties for small, exclusive groups of peoples, with a few couches and tables spread throughout the room and a small mini bar set up on the opposite side of the room, an impressive glass case stocked with foreign liquors you could neither recognize nor name.\u00a0</p><p>Harry sat you down on the couch nearest to you, your figure sinking into the deep cushions as you took a seat next to him. The silence surrounding you was almost suffocating, your heartbeat racing as you suddenly realized that this was a make-or-break situation on your hands. After you confess, there were really only two outcomes: he\u2019d miraculously reciprocate your feelings, or he\u2019d reject you as gently as he could before rushing off to take comfort in his actual girlfriend for the rest of his life. Either way, you were unprepared to see what came out of your mouth after months, possibly even years, of suppressing every feeling of love or affection you\u2019d experienced towards him.\u00a0</p><p>Your frantic train of thought was broken by the culprit of your racing heart himself, his hands placed casually on his knees as he turned towards you. \u201cWhat did y\u2019need to talk \u2018bout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-Well&hellip;\u201d you began nervously, swallowing thickly before tucking a rogue strand of hair behind your ear. \u201cOkay, so, I didn\u2019t expect to tell you like this. I actually wasn\u2019t even planning to tell you at all tonight until Nick practically forced me-\u201d</p><p>A chuckle left Harry\u2019s mouth, his nose scrunching in the cute way that it normally did when he found something particularly amusing. \u201cNever let Grimmy of all people force you into things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you countered, rolling your eyes. As much as you were dreading what was about to happen, you also knew that, in the back of your head, you always figured it\u2019d be Nick\u2019s doing if you ever confessed. Call it a hunch, but it was just in his person to push his friends to do the things they were terrified of. \u201cBut I guess this time he had a point.\u201d</p><p>The amused grin remained on Harry\u2019s face, completely unaware of what you were about to say. \u201cAnd what point was that?\u201d</p><p><i>Deep breath</i>. \u201cThat I need to stop being an emotional little bitch and finally confess to something that I\u2019ve known for quite some time now.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyebrows raised in surprise at your vulgar language, not expecting something like that out of you during what he figured was a serious situation. He opened his mouth to interrupt, but you knew that the only way you\u2019d ever actually say what you needed to was if you plowed through what you had already started. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of homewreckers, and never in my life have I ever wanted to be one, but my timing in life is just so inherently terrible that every time I even let myself think of telling you, you\u2019d suddenly come to me about a new girl that you\u2019d begun to like. Every single time, I\u2019ve just pushed whatever I was feeling to the back of my mind, because all I\u2019ve ever wanted for you was to be as happy as you could be, but I guess in the process, I\u2019ve kind of pushed off my own happiness, too.\u201d</p><p>Harry reached out a hand and laid it on your arm, all amusement gone from his face now as your words sunk in. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking \u2018bout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m saying this because I expect something out of you, or if it\u2019s because Nick has been bothering me about it for weeks now and I\u2019m actually <i>very</i> drunk, or if I really just need to get this out of my system and into the universe, but&hellip;\u201d You paused. <i>Deep breath. Close your eyes. Let it out. Open</i>. \u201cI love you. And I have for quite some time now, actually.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, a slow blink, a breathless stutter, a tight grip still on your forearm. \u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>You let out a little giggle of disbelief, keeping your eyes locked onto his. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m kind of- well, in love with you. And it feels really good to say that out loud. Finally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, actually? R-Really?\u201d Harry stuttered, his emerald eyes still wide with disbelief. It seemed as if his brain had short-circuited, his mind not completely able to comprehend what you had just said.</p><p>\u201cActually, really,\u201d you answered, slightly smiling in hopes that he had something (literally, anything) else to say to you. \u201cListen, you don\u2019t have to say anything back. I know you\u2019re with Peyton, and this was completely uncalled for with the worst timing in the world, but&hellip;\u201d You let out a sigh, not knowing what else to do but shrug a bit hopelessly. \u201cI just needed to say that. For you, for me, I dunno. But I really needed to.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s train of thought seemed to finally catch up to present time, his expression transforming into a mix of surprise and confusion. He let go of his grip on your arm, his hands falling into his lap and twisting together. \u201cI-I just-\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, a soft voice permeated the walls and caught your and his attention, your heart dropping as it got closer and closer to the door, more recognizable with each call. \u201cHarry? Are you up here?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened once again, this time in shock as he registered who was outside the door. You bit your lip nervously, heart falling at the knowledge that as soon as she found the two of you, any moment the two of you could\u2019ve had was now not going to happen. Your gaze flickered towards the door as you heard a knock, Harry\u2019s eyes following your own before- \u201cHa- oh. There you are, bub, I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes flicked between Peyton, who was now standing in the doorway of the room, and you, who was now staring down at your feet in the hopes that your confession wouldn\u2019t reach the ears of the girl he was with. He seemed to contemplate something, his hand twitching towards you as if wanting to stay and talk through the eruption of complicated emotions you had just thrown at him, but after one more look at the petite girl waiting for a response, he stood up from the couch slowly. \u201cY-Yeah, sorry, love. Y/N needed t\u2019talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she muttered, crossing her arms across her chest as to fight off a chill. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p><p>Whether or not she meant that question for you, you stood up from the couch and spun to face her, flashing a small smile at her. \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine. Just personal stuff.\u201d You turned back towards Harry, at a loss as to how to say anything at all to him now with his girlfriend standing mere feet away. You felt a myriad of emotions, ranging from relief to hope to heartbreak, before swallowing your pride and shoving them back into the deep recesses of your head. You might have just confessed your love to him, but now was not the time for you (<i>Was it ever going to be?</i>). \u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d</p><p>A tentative question, filled with \u2018<i>Are we okay? Will you talk to me? Does this change us? Am I going to lose you? Do you still need me?\u2019.\u00a0</i></p><p>An answer, assured, comforting, and to you, just a little bit hopeful. \u201cOf course. Always.\u201d</p><p><b>word\u00a0count: 4.2k</b></p>",

Not that you were actively hoping that she was exponentially less impressive or captivating in person, but you definitely never thought she\u2019d be able to live up to the flawless image of a woman that Harry had created in his endless fawning over her throughout the past few weeks. While he had initially come to you with a heart heavy with the fact that she allegedly claimed he \u201cwasn\u2019t her type\u201d, any little doubt anyone had harbored about her eventually falling to his charm was decidedly crushed at the vision of them standing hip-to-hip with his arm securely wrapped around her slim waist as they both laughed at whatever hilarious anecdote Mitch seemed to be reenacting in front of them. You, however, knew from the very beginning that they would end up together, because, well, with your luck, didn\u2019t they always?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not even that pretty,\u201d Nick commented, taking another lengthy sip of the bright blue cocktail the bartender had concocted from behind the bar at one of the most exclusive clubs in Beverly Hills. Both of you were leaning against said bar, sipping away at each of your drinks as you casually inspected Harry and his new girlfriend from across the dance floor as they mingled with the rest of Harry\u2019s band in a booth.\u00a0</p><p>Harry had made the decision to rent out the entire establishment in celebration of the fact that he had, just a couple weeks ago, concluded his first world tour as a solo artist. The numbers alone that the Harry Styles: Live on Tour expedition generated were mindblowing, and among the pain at seeing him so affectionate with his new girlfriend, you felt this immeasurable pride swell in your chest at the impact that this man was making on the world, a small stop in his venture to make the world a better place. Just the fact that he was able to donate over a million dollars to charities all around the world made you want to throw your own celebratory party for him with your own money (not that you were even close to being financially able to, but you know, it\u2019s the sentiment that counts).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGrimmy,\u201d you admonished, shoving your and Harry\u2019s friend lightly with a little laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged unabashedly, giving you a pointed look. \u201cJust sayin\u2019, Y/N. By the way he went on about her, I expected nothing short of a female Adonis on his arm tonight, and instead, I set eyes on this aspiring Instagram model who publicly celebrates every 10k follower milestone with a watered down shot of vodka on a livestream.\u201d</p><p>You gave Nick a dead stare, shaking your head slightly. \u201cThat was\u2026 oddly specific.\u201d You set down your drink on the counter behind you, slumping down onto one of the high stools. \u201cShe\u2019s <i>actually</i> a uni student studying criminal psychology as a junior at USC, and she spends more time volunteering at the animal shelter down the street from her apartment than she does taking vodka shots.\u201d You pause. \u201cAnd she only has 736 followers, so your Instagram theory is completely wrong on more than one level.\u201d</p><p>Nick blinked slowly, tilting his head to the side. \u201c<i>That</i> was oddly specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what Harry tells me,\u201d you muttered, grabbing your drink from the table and downing it all in one go. \u201cNot like <i>I </i>stalk her in my free time.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed heavily, downing his drink before lifting his hand to get the bartender\u2019s attention and ordering two palomas. \u201cListen, love, my point was that she isn\u2019t as eye-catching as H made her up to be.\u201d He thanked the bartender with a smile and a nod of gratitude before handing you a drink. \u201cOn any account, she\u2019s no match to <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, taking a small sip from your new cocktail before coughing at the burn it left sliding down your throat. \u201cThat is way too much tequila.\u201d</p><p>Nick took a sip in response, licking his teeth before shrugging lightly and continuing on with his original point. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t just tell \u2018im you\u2019re completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with him so you can move along with your happily ever after, missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019ll just casually walk up to him with a, \u2018<i>Hi, how are you, just dropping by to say how completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with you I am, have a nice day!</i>\u2019\u201d you said sarcastically, taking another tentative sip of your paloma.\u00a0</p><p>Nick scoffed. \u201cYou can do it with a little more class than that, Y/N.\u201d You narrowed your eyes at him, opening your mouth to respond but being cut off. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re so afraid of, love! He\u2019s obviously very smitten with your cute little self, or else he wouldn\u2019t have gone through all this trouble of procuring a cover-up girlfriend-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-to make it seem like he\u2019s completely in love with someone else, when in reality, he\u2019s just trying to draw you out with jealousy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am <i>not</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-before he finally confesses that he\u2019s been trying to get with your arse since he met you all those years ago and fell for the way your eyes are <i>\u2018deep and complex like a flowing river\u2019</i> or how the sheen of your hair <i>\u2018looks golden under the perfect natural lighting\u2019</i> or some Jane Austen-esque shit like that.\u201d</p><p>You reached out and hit Nick on the shoulder, careful not to jostle your drink around too much as he held up his hands in surrender. \u201cShut <i>up,</i> Nick!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in what appeared to be disbelief, taking a lengthy sip from his glass as if to prepare himself for what he was about to say to you. \u201cWhat is it that makes you think he doesn\u2019t feel the same way? Is it the family? Anne not fancy you much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Anne lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Gem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, <i>you </i>like me so-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not like <i>him </i>enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the fame? Spotlight too much for ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, don\u2019t be-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I got it</i>. It\u2019s the Gucci, eh? Too lavish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, I swear to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should reconsider if it\u2019s the Gucci. His girlfriend at the mo\u2019 seems to be just fine with it. Honestly-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>That</i>,\u201d you interrupt loudly, setting your glass down on the table. \u201cThe <i>girlfriend</i>, Grim. It\u2019s the girlfriend part that makes me think he might not be as in love with me as I am with him. Call me crazy, but the last time I checked, you don\u2019t ask out someone if you\u2019ve fallen for someone else.\u201d</p><p>Nick paused, putting his drink next to yours on the table before leaning towards you and placing his hands on your legs as if to prove he\u2019s serious now. \u201cBabes, I am one of his best mates. Believe me when I say that what he feels for her doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to even an ounce of love I\u2019ve seen he has for you.\u201d His grip on you tightened, eyes boring into yours with an intensity so rare for someone as playful and fun-loving as him. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of feeling so depressed? Ignored? <i>Loveless</i>?\u201d</p><p>You sighed deeply, Nick\u2019s words pulling at your heartstrings as you momentarily considered that maybe, just maybe, Harry felt more than what he\u2019s led on towards you, and you were being too ignorant to acknowledge it. \u201cI\u2019m not <i>loveless</i>, Nick.\u201d You shook your head, as if ridding any hopeful thought Nick had planted in your head. \u201cBesides, even if he did, at one point, like me back, it doesn\u2019t matter now. You said it yourself; he practically worships the ground Peyton walks on. Just because she\u2019s not as impressive as we thought she was, Harry obviously feels very strongly about her, or he would\u2019ve never talked about her the way he did.\u201d You paused, closing your eyes momentarily. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not a homewrecker, and I\u2019m not going to start just because I took too long to confess my feelings to him. As his best mate, and mine, you should respect that, Grimmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs one of your best friends, that is the reason why I can\u2019t just sit here and watch on as you pine after a man who would drop everything for you in a second,\u201d Nick insisted, cupping your face in his hands and leaning even closer. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for him, and Peyton? She\u2019s not it. You are what\u2019s best for him. And that is why\u2026\u201d You watched as he shut his eyes, taking in a deep dramatic breath as if preparing for something huge. You felt your heart begin to beat faster, knowing that when Nick put his mind to something, it was next to impossible to convince him out of it. \u201cYou are going to talk to him. Tonight. Right now, actually.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed, reaching up to grasp his wrists and pull his hands away from your face. \u201cEven if I wanted to, what about Peyton?\u201d</p><p>A quick flash of a mischievous smirk flitted across his face, one of his eyes dropping into a cheeky wink. \u201cI\u2019ll handle her.\u201d</p><p>With that, Nick abruptly got up from the bar stool and began to dramatically scream out the words of the rap song currently pounding through the speakers, drunkenly swaying his hips from side to side as he pretended to stumble his way across the dance floor towards Harry and Peyton. You watched as their entire table\u2019s attention was captured by Nick\u2019s gyrating figure as he reached their table, serenading Peyton with what you were positive were the wrong words along with Kanye West. \u201c<i>Eighteen years, eighteen years, she got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years\u2026</i>\u201d</p><p>Watching Nick embarrass himself for a moment more, you took a deep breath and closed your eyes, beginning a mental pep talk to hype yourself up before you went over there. \u2018<i>Nick went through all this trouble to get you to talk to him, so get up off your ass, stop being a little bitch, and just talk to him. It\u2019s just Harry. He\u2019s your best friend. What could possibly go wrong?</i>\u2019</p><p>For a shot of extra luck (quite literally), you downed the rest of your obscenely strong drink in one go and shook your head to clear the resulting fog from your vision before getting up and making your way towards them. You felt like you needed to walk with purpose, as this might\u2019ve been the prelude to a defining moment in your and Harry\u2019s relationship, the thing that kickstarts the rest of your lives together (or just the prologue to your depressing autobiography, whichever seemed more plausible). But you probably just looked like how David did when he first set eyes on Goliath.</p><p>As you approached, you noticed that Nick had seamlessly executed his plan at coercing Peyton away from Harry\u2019s side and out onto the dance floor, their retreating figures visible as Harry watched amusedly from his seat. Nick continued to scream out Kanye West lyrics, having moved on from simple swaying to a whole routine consisting of thrusting and rolling his hips while spinning in a slow circle, an odd combination loosely inspired by the Magic Mike routine you\u2019d both witnessed at the strip club he\u2019d dragged you to a few days prior (fortunately or unfortunately, it was a bit of a toss-up). Needless to say, Peyton was certainly occupied.</p><p>\u201cH?\u201d you asked tentatively, rocking onto the heels of your feet as Harry turned his attention away from his best friend now animatedly attempting to engage Peyton in dancing with him instead of laughing at him.\u00a0</p><p>Familiar green eyes settled on your face, your nervous smile considerably less enthusiastic than the bright grin that lit up Harry\u2019s face at the sight of you. Aside from the brief hug and introduction to his girlfriend at the beginning of the party, you hadn\u2019t had the chance to talk to him at all that night, instead choosing to drown yourself in a plethora of Nick\u2019s eclectic taste in cocktails up until this very moment.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he exclaimed, immediately sliding over to make room for you in the booth. You settled down next to him, his arm pulling you into a tight side embrace with a small peck on your temple. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been? I haven\u2019t seen you all night.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile at his show of affection, shrugging as if you hadn\u2019t been staring at him love on his girlfriend for the past three hours. \u201cYou\u2019re a busy man,\u201d you responded lightly, shoving him playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t have time for commoners like me anymore.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, cupping your face in his giant hands and lightly squeezing your cheeks. \u201cAlways have time for you, love.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, another person\u2019s voice breaks into your bubble with sarcastic offense. \u201c<i>Hi, Mitch. How are you, Mitch? Oh, I\u2019m doing great, Y/N, thank you so much for caring about literally anyone else but your lover boy over there.</i>\u201d</p><p>Your eyes flashed to Mitch, who you admittedly hadn\u2019t really paid much mind to until he spoke up. He had a smug smirk on his face, knowing his comment about your \u201clover boy\u201d was nearing dangerous territory of Harry getting suspicious. Then again, you were also well aware that Harry had been contentedly naive for however long you\u2019d been in love with him, with people like his entire band and Nick being privy to your affection and constantly pushing towards a very public confession.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShove off, Mitch,\u201d Harry laughed, throwing an arm on the back of the booth behind you. \u201cPeyton might hear you. Don\u2019t wanna get the missus upset, eh?\u201d</p><p>You felt yourself stiffen at the mention of his girlfriend, the impending confession weighing even heavier at the tip of your tongue. The familiar sensation of your heart cracking just a bit more made you slump down a bit in your seat, your smile transforming into a fake grimace. Your eyes met Mitch\u2019s across the table, and the sympathetic glance he sent your way didn\u2019t make you feel any better about what you were going to do. \u2018<i>Not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cY\u2019alright?\u201d Your attention was pulled back to the boy next to you, whose eyebrows were now furrowed in slight concern at your sudden shift in mood. It hurt just slightly knowing that he was so in tune with your emotions that he could detect the smallest changes in emotion in you, falsely convincing you that he just maybe paid as much attention to you as you did to him. \u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your lips into your mouth, a quick \u2018now or never\u2019 flitting through your head before you felt the words fall out of your mouth at a pace way faster than normal. \u201cActually, I need to talk t\u2019you about something.\u201d</p><p>The worry on his face just deepened at your response, turning his body towards you more and leaning in closer. \u201cSure, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d you hummed, suddenly very aware that you were sat in a very public club at a table with someone else that was most likely listening to every word you were saying. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda important.\u201d You glanced around the perimeter of the club, eyes flitting over the spiral staircase in the corner of the room that led up to what appeared to be a much more private area of the club. \u201cIs there somewhere more private we could talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Harry answered, grabbing your hand and pulling you up from your seat before gently ushering you out of the booth. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he called to Mitch, who had been distracted chatting with one of Harry\u2019s tour assistants that had just approached the table. Mitch nodded in return, locking eyes with you and winking subtly before turning away completely.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you made your way through the throng of his friends and colleagues dancing closely together to the beat of whatever new rap song the DJ had blaring through the speakers, Harry briefly being stopped multiple times by congratulations as he caught the attention of almost everyone you passed. He quickly thanked them, shaking hands with a few and halting completely to embrace others while you stood quietly behind him, silently giving yourself a mental pep talk about the best way to go about what you had to tell him. After all, there isn\u2019t really a \u201cConfessing You\u2019re In Love with Someone for Dummies\u201d to help you out.</p><p>Once you both broke out of the crowd, Harry took a loose hold of your hand again and pulled you towards the spiral staircase you had spotted earlier, checking behind him one last time before beginning to climb the steps two at a time with his long legs. As you ascended the stairs behind him, you glanced back down onto the club laid out under you, catching Nick\u2019s eyes as he continued to dance with Peyton and sending him a wide-eyed look of panic. He grinned back, sending you a thumbs-up and mouthing a \u201cgood luck\u201d before Harry pulled you up onto the second floor and Nick fell out of view.\u00a0</p><p>You faced a long, quiet hallway extending from both sides of the staircase, the floor lined with a deep red velvet carpet that cushioned yours and Harry\u2019s steps so that neither could be heard as he continued to lead you into the first room to your right.\u00a0</p><p>It was what appeared to be a room reserved for private parties for small, exclusive groups of peoples, with a few couches and tables spread throughout the room and a small mini bar set up on the opposite side of the room, an impressive glass case stocked with foreign liquors you could neither recognize nor name.\u00a0</p><p>Harry sat you down on the couch nearest to you, your figure sinking into the deep cushions as you took a seat next to him. The silence surrounding you was almost suffocating, your heartbeat racing as you suddenly realized that this was a make-or-break situation on your hands. After you confess, there were really only two outcomes: he\u2019d miraculously reciprocate your feelings, or he\u2019d reject you as gently as he could before rushing off to take comfort in his actual girlfriend for the rest of his life. Either way, you were unprepared to see what came out of your mouth after months, possibly even years, of suppressing every feeling of love or affection you\u2019d experienced towards him.\u00a0</p><p>Your frantic train of thought was broken by the culprit of your racing heart himself, his hands placed casually on his knees as he turned towards you. \u201cWhat did y\u2019need to talk \u2018bout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-Well\u2026\u201d you began nervously, swallowing thickly before tucking a rogue strand of hair behind your ear. \u201cOkay, so, I didn\u2019t expect to tell you like this. I actually wasn\u2019t even planning to tell you at all tonight until Nick practically forced me-\u201d</p><p>A chuckle left Harry\u2019s mouth, his nose scrunching in the cute way that it normally did when he found something particularly amusing. \u201cNever let Grimmy of all people force you into things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you countered, rolling your eyes. As much as you were dreading what was about to happen, you also knew that, in the back of your head, you always figured it\u2019d be Nick\u2019s doing if you ever confessed. Call it a hunch, but it was just in his person to push his friends to do the things they were terrified of. \u201cBut I guess this time he had a point.\u201d</p><p>The amused grin remained on Harry\u2019s face, completely unaware of what you were about to say. \u201cAnd what point was that?\u201d</p><p><i>Deep breath</i>. \u201cThat I need to stop being an emotional little bitch and finally confess to something that I\u2019ve known for quite some time now.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyebrows raised in surprise at your vulgar language, not expecting something like that out of you during what he figured was a serious situation. He opened his mouth to interrupt, but you knew that the only way you\u2019d ever actually say what you needed to was if you plowed through what you had already started. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of homewreckers, and never in my life have I ever wanted to be one, but my timing in life is just so inherently terrible that every time I even let myself think of telling you, you\u2019d suddenly come to me about a new girl that you\u2019d begun to like. Every single time, I\u2019ve just pushed whatever I was feeling to the back of my mind, because all I\u2019ve ever wanted for you was to be as happy as you could be, but I guess in the process, I\u2019ve kind of pushed off my own happiness, too.\u201d</p><p>Harry reached out a hand and laid it on your arm, all amusement gone from his face now as your words sunk in. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking \u2018bout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m saying this because I expect something out of you, or if it\u2019s because Nick has been bothering me about it for weeks now and I\u2019m actually <i>very</i> drunk, or if I really just need to get this out of my system and into the universe, but\u2026\u201d You paused. <i>Deep breath. Close your eyes. Let it out. Open</i>. \u201cI love you. And I have for quite some time now, actually.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, a slow blink, a breathless stutter, a tight grip still on your forearm. \u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>You let out a little giggle of disbelief, keeping your eyes locked onto his. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m kind of- well, in love with you. And it feels really good to say that out loud. Finally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, actually? R-Really?\u201d Harry stuttered, his emerald eyes still wide with disbelief. It seemed as if his brain had short-circuited, his mind not completely able to comprehend what you had just said.</p><p>\u201cActually, really,\u201d you answered, slightly smiling in hopes that he had something (literally, anything) else to say to you. \u201cListen, you don\u2019t have to say anything back. I know you\u2019re with Peyton, and this was completely uncalled for with the worst timing in the world, but\u2026\u201d You let out a sigh, not knowing what else to do but shrug a bit hopelessly. \u201cI just needed to say that. For you, for me, I dunno. But I really needed to.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s train of thought seemed to finally catch up to present time, his expression transforming into a mix of surprise and confusion. He let go of his grip on your arm, his hands falling into his lap and twisting together. \u201cI-I just-\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, a soft voice permeated the walls and caught your and his attention, your heart dropping as it got closer and closer to the door, more recognizable with each call. \u201cHarry? Are you up here?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened once again, this time in shock as he registered who was outside the door. You bit your lip nervously, heart falling at the knowledge that as soon as she found the two of you, any moment the two of you could\u2019ve had was now not going to happen. Your gaze flickered towards the door as you heard a knock, Harry\u2019s eyes following your own before- \u201cHa- oh. There you are, bub, I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes flicked between Peyton, who was now standing in the doorway of the room, and you, who was now staring down at your feet in the hopes that your confession wouldn\u2019t reach the ears of the girl he was with. He seemed to contemplate something, his hand twitching towards you as if wanting to stay and talk through the eruption of complicated emotions you had just thrown at him, but after one more look at the petite girl waiting for a response, he stood up from the couch slowly. \u201cY-Yeah, sorry, love. Y/N needed t\u2019talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she muttered, crossing her arms across her chest as to fight off a chill. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p><p>Whether or not she meant that question for you, you stood up from the couch and spun to face her, flashing a small smile at her. \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine. Just personal stuff.\u201d You turned back towards Harry, at a loss as to how to say anything at all to him now with his girlfriend standing mere feet away. You felt a myriad of emotions, ranging from relief to hope to heartbreak, before swallowing your pride and shoving them back into the deep recesses of your head. You might have just confessed your love to him, but now was not the time for you (<i>Was it ever going to be?</i>). \u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d</p><p>A tentative question, filled with \u2018<i>Are we okay? Will you talk to me? Does this change us? Am I going to lose you? Do you still need me?\u2019.\u00a0</i></p><p>An answer, assured, comforting, and to you, just a little bit hopeful. \u201cOf course. Always.\u201d</p><p><b>word\u00a0count: 4.2k</b></p></p>",

Not that you were actively hoping that she was exponentially less impressive or captivating in person, but you definitely never thought she\u2019d be able to live up to the flawless image of a woman that Harry had created in his endless fawning over her throughout the past few weeks. While he had initially come to you with a heart heavy with the fact that she allegedly claimed he \u201cwasn\u2019t her type\u201d, any little doubt anyone had harbored about her eventually falling to his charm was decidedly crushed at the vision of them standing hip-to-hip with his arm securely wrapped around her slim waist as they both laughed at whatever hilarious anecdote Mitch seemed to be reenacting in front of them. You, however, knew from the very beginning that they would end up together, because, well, with your luck, didn\u2019t they always?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not even that pretty,\u201d Nick commented, taking another lengthy sip of the bright blue cocktail the bartender had concocted from behind the bar at one of the most exclusive clubs in Beverly Hills. Both of you were leaning against said bar, sipping away at each of your drinks as you casually inspected Harry and his new girlfriend from across the dance floor as they mingled with the rest of Harry\u2019s band in a booth.\u00a0</p><p>Harry had made the decision to rent out the entire establishment in celebration of the fact that he had, just a couple weeks ago, concluded his first world tour as a solo artist. The numbers alone that the Harry Styles: Live on Tour expedition generated were mindblowing, and among the pain at seeing him so affectionate with his new girlfriend, you felt this immeasurable pride swell in your chest at the impact that this man was making on the world, a small stop in his venture to make the world a better place. Just the fact that he was able to donate over a million dollars to charities all around the world made you want to throw your own celebratory party for him with your own money (not that you were even close to being financially able to, but you know, it\u2019s the sentiment that counts).\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGrimmy,\u201d you admonished, shoving your and Harry\u2019s friend lightly with a little laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged unabashedly, giving you a pointed look. \u201cJust sayin\u2019, Y/N. By the way he went on about her, I expected nothing short of a female Adonis on his arm tonight, and instead, I set eyes on this aspiring Instagram model who publicly celebrates every 10k follower milestone with a watered down shot of vodka on a livestream.\u201d</p><p>You gave Nick a dead stare, shaking your head slightly. \u201cThat was\u2026 oddly specific.\u201d You set down your drink on the counter behind you, slumping down onto one of the high stools. \u201cShe\u2019s <i>actually</i> a uni student studying criminal psychology as a junior at USC, and she spends more time volunteering at the animal shelter down the street from her apartment than she does taking vodka shots.\u201d You pause. \u201cAnd she only has 736 followers, so your Instagram theory is completely wrong on more than one level.\u201d</p><p>Nick blinked slowly, tilting his head to the side. \u201c<i>That</i> was oddly specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what Harry tells me,\u201d you muttered, grabbing your drink from the table and downing it all in one go. \u201cNot like <i>I </i>stalk her in my free time.\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed heavily, downing his drink before lifting his hand to get the bartender\u2019s attention and ordering two palomas. \u201cListen, love, my point was that she isn\u2019t as eye-catching as H made her up to be.\u201d He thanked the bartender with a smile and a nod of gratitude before handing you a drink. \u201cOn any account, she\u2019s no match to <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, taking a small sip from your new cocktail before coughing at the burn it left sliding down your throat. \u201cThat is way too much tequila.\u201d</p><p>Nick took a sip in response, licking his teeth before shrugging lightly and continuing on with his original point. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t just tell \u2018im you\u2019re completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with him so you can move along with your happily ever after, missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019ll just casually walk up to him with a, \u2018<i>Hi, how are you, just dropping by to say how completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with you I am, have a nice day!</i>\u2019\u201d you said sarcastically, taking another tentative sip of your paloma.\u00a0</p><p>Nick scoffed. \u201cYou can do it with a little more class than that, Y/N.\u201d You narrowed your eyes at him, opening your mouth to respond but being cut off. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re so afraid of, love! He\u2019s obviously very smitten with your cute little self, or else he wouldn\u2019t have gone through all this trouble of procuring a cover-up girlfriend-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-to make it seem like he\u2019s completely in love with someone else, when in reality, he\u2019s just trying to draw you out with jealousy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am <i>not</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-before he finally confesses that he\u2019s been trying to get with your arse since he met you all those years ago and fell for the way your eyes are <i>\u2018deep and complex like a flowing river\u2019</i> or how the sheen of your hair <i>\u2018looks golden under the perfect natural lighting\u2019</i> or some Jane Austen-esque shit like that.\u201d</p><p>You reached out and hit Nick on the shoulder, careful not to jostle your drink around too much as he held up his hands in surrender. \u201cShut <i>up,</i> Nick!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in what appeared to be disbelief, taking a lengthy sip from his glass as if to prepare himself for what he was about to say to you. \u201cWhat is it that makes you think he doesn\u2019t feel the same way? Is it the family? Anne not fancy you much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Anne lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Gem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, <i>you </i>like me so-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not like <i>him </i>enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the fame? Spotlight too much for ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, don\u2019t be-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I got it</i>. It\u2019s the Gucci, eh? Too lavish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, I swear to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should reconsider if it\u2019s the Gucci. His girlfriend at the mo\u2019 seems to be just fine with it. Honestly-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>That</i>,\u201d you interrupt loudly, setting your glass down on the table. \u201cThe <i>girlfriend</i>, Grim. It\u2019s the girlfriend part that makes me think he might not be as in love with me as I am with him. Call me crazy, but the last time I checked, you don\u2019t ask out someone if you\u2019ve fallen for someone else.\u201d</p><p>Nick paused, putting his drink next to yours on the table before leaning towards you and placing his hands on your legs as if to prove he\u2019s serious now. \u201cBabes, I am one of his best mates. Believe me when I say that what he feels for her doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to even an ounce of love I\u2019ve seen he has for you.\u201d His grip on you tightened, eyes boring into yours with an intensity so rare for someone as playful and fun-loving as him. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of feeling so depressed? Ignored? <i>Loveless</i>?\u201d</p><p>You sighed deeply, Nick\u2019s words pulling at your heartstrings as you momentarily considered that maybe, just maybe, Harry felt more than what he\u2019s led on towards you, and you were being too ignorant to acknowledge it. \u201cI\u2019m not <i>loveless</i>, Nick.\u201d You shook your head, as if ridding any hopeful thought Nick had planted in your head. \u201cBesides, even if he did, at one point, like me back, it doesn\u2019t matter now. You said it yourself; he practically worships the ground Peyton walks on. Just because she\u2019s not as impressive as we thought she was, Harry obviously feels very strongly about her, or he would\u2019ve never talked about her the way he did.\u201d You paused, closing your eyes momentarily. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m not a homewrecker, and I\u2019m not going to start just because I took too long to confess my feelings to him. As his best mate, and mine, you should respect that, Grimmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs one of your best friends, that is the reason why I can\u2019t just sit here and watch on as you pine after a man who would drop everything for you in a second,\u201d Nick insisted, cupping your face in his hands and leaning even closer. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for him, and Peyton? She\u2019s not it. You are what\u2019s best for him. And that is why\u2026\u201d You watched as he shut his eyes, taking in a deep dramatic breath as if preparing for something huge. You felt your heart begin to beat faster, knowing that when Nick put his mind to something, it was next to impossible to convince him out of it. \u201cYou are going to talk to him. Tonight. Right now, actually.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed, reaching up to grasp his wrists and pull his hands away from your face. \u201cEven if I wanted to, what about Peyton?\u201d</p><p>A quick flash of a mischievous smirk flitted across his face, one of his eyes dropping into a cheeky wink. \u201cI\u2019ll handle her.\u201d</p><p>With that, Nick abruptly got up from the bar stool and began to dramatically scream out the words of the rap song currently pounding through the speakers, drunkenly swaying his hips from side to side as he pretended to stumble his way across the dance floor towards Harry and Peyton. You watched as their entire table\u2019s attention was captured by Nick\u2019s gyrating figure as he reached their table, serenading Peyton with what you were positive were the wrong words along with Kanye West. \u201c<i>Eighteen years, eighteen years, she got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years\u2026</i>\u201d</p><p>Watching Nick embarrass himself for a moment more, you took a deep breath and closed your eyes, beginning a mental pep talk to hype yourself up before you went over there. \u2018<i>Nick went through all this trouble to get you to talk to him, so get up off your ass, stop being a little bitch, and just talk to him. It\u2019s just Harry. He\u2019s your best friend. What could possibly go wrong?</i>\u2019</p><p>For a shot of extra luck (quite literally), you downed the rest of your obscenely strong drink in one go and shook your head to clear the resulting fog from your vision before getting up and making your way towards them. You felt like you needed to walk with purpose, as this might\u2019ve been the prelude to a defining moment in your and Harry\u2019s relationship, the thing that kickstarts the rest of your lives together (or just the prologue to your depressing autobiography, whichever seemed more plausible). But you probably just looked like how David did when he first set eyes on Goliath.</p><p>As you approached, you noticed that Nick had seamlessly executed his plan at coercing Peyton away from Harry\u2019s side and out onto the dance floor, their retreating figures visible as Harry watched amusedly from his seat. Nick continued to scream out Kanye West lyrics, having moved on from simple swaying to a whole routine consisting of thrusting and rolling his hips while spinning in a slow circle, an odd combination loosely inspired by the Magic Mike routine you\u2019d both witnessed at the strip club he\u2019d dragged you to a few days prior (fortunately or unfortunately, it was a bit of a toss-up). Needless to say, Peyton was certainly occupied.</p><p>\u201cH?\u201d you asked tentatively, rocking onto the heels of your feet as Harry turned his attention away from his best friend now animatedly attempting to engage Peyton in dancing with him instead of laughing at him.\u00a0</p><p>Familiar green eyes settled on your face, your nervous smile considerably less enthusiastic than the bright grin that lit up Harry\u2019s face at the sight of you. Aside from the brief hug and introduction to his girlfriend at the beginning of the party, you hadn\u2019t had the chance to talk to him at all that night, instead choosing to drown yourself in a plethora of Nick\u2019s eclectic taste in cocktails up until this very moment.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d he exclaimed, immediately sliding over to make room for you in the booth. You settled down next to him, his arm pulling you into a tight side embrace with a small peck on your temple. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been? I haven\u2019t seen you all night.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile at his show of affection, shrugging as if you hadn\u2019t been staring at him love on his girlfriend for the past three hours. \u201cYou\u2019re a busy man,\u201d you responded lightly, shoving him playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t have time for commoners like me anymore.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, cupping your face in his giant hands and lightly squeezing your cheeks. \u201cAlways have time for you, love.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, another person\u2019s voice breaks into your bubble with sarcastic offense. \u201c<i>Hi, Mitch. How are you, Mitch? Oh, I\u2019m doing great, Y/N, thank you so much for caring about literally anyone else but your lover boy over there.</i>\u201d</p><p>Your eyes flashed to Mitch, who you admittedly hadn\u2019t really paid much mind to until he spoke up. He had a smug smirk on his face, knowing his comment about your \u201clover boy\u201d was nearing dangerous territory of Harry getting suspicious. Then again, you were also well aware that Harry had been contentedly naive for however long you\u2019d been in love with him, with people like his entire band and Nick being privy to your affection and constantly pushing towards a very public confession.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShove off, Mitch,\u201d Harry laughed, throwing an arm on the back of the booth behind you. \u201cPeyton might hear you. Don\u2019t wanna get the missus upset, eh?\u201d</p><p>You felt yourself stiffen at the mention of his girlfriend, the impending confession weighing even heavier at the tip of your tongue. The familiar sensation of your heart cracking just a bit more made you slump down a bit in your seat, your smile transforming into a fake grimace. Your eyes met Mitch\u2019s across the table, and the sympathetic glance he sent your way didn\u2019t make you feel any better about what you were going to do. \u2018<i>Not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cY\u2019alright?\u201d Your attention was pulled back to the boy next to you, whose eyebrows were now furrowed in slight concern at your sudden shift in mood. It hurt just slightly knowing that he was so in tune with your emotions that he could detect the smallest changes in emotion in you, falsely convincing you that he just maybe paid as much attention to you as you did to him. \u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your lips into your mouth, a quick \u2018now or never\u2019 flitting through your head before you felt the words fall out of your mouth at a pace way faster than normal. \u201cActually, I need to talk t\u2019you about something.\u201d</p><p>The worry on his face just deepened at your response, turning his body towards you more and leaning in closer. \u201cSure, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d you hummed, suddenly very aware that you were sat in a very public club at a table with someone else that was most likely listening to every word you were saying. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda important.\u201d You glanced around the perimeter of the club, eyes flitting over the spiral staircase in the corner of the room that led up to what appeared to be a much more private area of the club. \u201cIs there somewhere more private we could talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Harry answered, grabbing your hand and pulling you up from your seat before gently ushering you out of the booth. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he called to Mitch, who had been distracted chatting with one of Harry\u2019s tour assistants that had just approached the table. Mitch nodded in return, locking eyes with you and winking subtly before turning away completely.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you made your way through the throng of his friends and colleagues dancing closely together to the beat of whatever new rap song the DJ had blaring through the speakers, Harry briefly being stopped multiple times by congratulations as he caught the attention of almost everyone you passed. He quickly thanked them, shaking hands with a few and halting completely to embrace others while you stood quietly behind him, silently giving yourself a mental pep talk about the best way to go about what you had to tell him. After all, there isn\u2019t really a \u201cConfessing You\u2019re In Love with Someone for Dummies\u201d to help you out.</p><p>Once you both broke out of the crowd, Harry took a loose hold of your hand again and pulled you towards the spiral staircase you had spotted earlier, checking behind him one last time before beginning to climb the steps two at a time with his long legs. As you ascended the stairs behind him, you glanced back down onto the club laid out under you, catching Nick\u2019s eyes as he continued to dance with Peyton and sending him a wide-eyed look of panic. He grinned back, sending you a thumbs-up and mouthing a \u201cgood luck\u201d before Harry pulled you up onto the second floor and Nick fell out of view.\u00a0</p><p>You faced a long, quiet hallway extending from both sides of the staircase, the floor lined with a deep red velvet carpet that cushioned yours and Harry\u2019s steps so that neither could be heard as he continued to lead you into the first room to your right.\u00a0</p><p>It was what appeared to be a room reserved for private parties for small, exclusive groups of peoples, with a few couches and tables spread throughout the room and a small mini bar set up on the opposite side of the room, an impressive glass case stocked with foreign liquors you could neither recognize nor name.\u00a0</p><p>Harry sat you down on the couch nearest to you, your figure sinking into the deep cushions as you took a seat next to him. The silence surrounding you was almost suffocating, your heartbeat racing as you suddenly realized that this was a make-or-break situation on your hands. After you confess, there were really only two outcomes: he\u2019d miraculously reciprocate your feelings, or he\u2019d reject you as gently as he could before rushing off to take comfort in his actual girlfriend for the rest of his life. Either way, you were unprepared to see what came out of your mouth after months, possibly even years, of suppressing every feeling of love or affection you\u2019d experienced towards him.\u00a0</p><p>Your frantic train of thought was broken by the culprit of your racing heart himself, his hands placed casually on his knees as he turned towards you. \u201cWhat did y\u2019need to talk \u2018bout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-Well\u2026\u201d you began nervously, swallowing thickly before tucking a rogue strand of hair behind your ear. \u201cOkay, so, I didn\u2019t expect to tell you like this. I actually wasn\u2019t even planning to tell you at all tonight until Nick practically forced me-\u201d</p><p>A chuckle left Harry\u2019s mouth, his nose scrunching in the cute way that it normally did when he found something particularly amusing. \u201cNever let Grimmy of all people force you into things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you countered, rolling your eyes. As much as you were dreading what was about to happen, you also knew that, in the back of your head, you always figured it\u2019d be Nick\u2019s doing if you ever confessed. Call it a hunch, but it was just in his person to push his friends to do the things they were terrified of. \u201cBut I guess this time he had a point.\u201d</p><p>The amused grin remained on Harry\u2019s face, completely unaware of what you were about to say. \u201cAnd what point was that?\u201d</p><p><i>Deep breath</i>. \u201cThat I need to stop being an emotional little bitch and finally confess to something that I\u2019ve known for quite some time now.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyebrows raised in surprise at your vulgar language, not expecting something like that out of you during what he figured was a serious situation. He opened his mouth to interrupt, but you knew that the only way you\u2019d ever actually say what you needed to was if you plowed through what you had already started. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of homewreckers, and never in my life have I ever wanted to be one, but my timing in life is just so inherently terrible that every time I even let myself think of telling you, you\u2019d suddenly come to me about a new girl that you\u2019d begun to like. Every single time, I\u2019ve just pushed whatever I was feeling to the back of my mind, because all I\u2019ve ever wanted for you was to be as happy as you could be, but I guess in the process, I\u2019ve kind of pushed off my own happiness, too.\u201d</p><p>Harry reached out a hand and laid it on your arm, all amusement gone from his face now as your words sunk in. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking \u2018bout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m saying this because I expect something out of you, or if it\u2019s because Nick has been bothering me about it for weeks now and I\u2019m actually <i>very</i> drunk, or if I really just need to get this out of my system and into the universe, but\u2026\u201d You paused. <i>Deep breath. Close your eyes. Let it out. Open</i>. \u201cI love you. And I have for quite some time now, actually.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, a slow blink, a breathless stutter, a tight grip still on your forearm. \u201cW-What?\u201d</p><p>You let out a little giggle of disbelief, keeping your eyes locked onto his. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m kind of- well, in love with you. And it feels really good to say that out loud. Finally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, actually? R-Really?\u201d Harry stuttered, his emerald eyes still wide with disbelief. It seemed as if his brain had short-circuited, his mind not completely able to comprehend what you had just said.</p><p>\u201cActually, really,\u201d you answered, slightly smiling in hopes that he had something (literally, anything) else to say to you. \u201cListen, you don\u2019t have to say anything back. I know you\u2019re with Peyton, and this was completely uncalled for with the worst timing in the world, but\u2026\u201d You let out a sigh, not knowing what else to do but shrug a bit hopelessly. \u201cI just needed to say that. For you, for me, I dunno. But I really needed to.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s train of thought seemed to finally catch up to present time, his expression transforming into a mix of surprise and confusion. He let go of his grip on your arm, his hands falling into his lap and twisting together. \u201cI-I just-\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, a soft voice permeated the walls and caught your and his attention, your heart dropping as it got closer and closer to the door, more recognizable with each call. \u201cHarry? Are you up here?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened once again, this time in shock as he registered who was outside the door. You bit your lip nervously, heart falling at the knowledge that as soon as she found the two of you, any moment the two of you could\u2019ve had was now not going to happen. Your gaze flickered towards the door as you heard a knock, Harry\u2019s eyes following your own before- \u201cHa- oh. There you are, bub, I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes flicked between Peyton, who was now standing in the doorway of the room, and you, who was now staring down at your feet in the hopes that your confession wouldn\u2019t reach the ears of the girl he was with. He seemed to contemplate something, his hand twitching towards you as if wanting to stay and talk through the eruption of complicated emotions you had just thrown at him, but after one more look at the petite girl waiting for a response, he stood up from the couch slowly. \u201cY-Yeah, sorry, love. Y/N needed t\u2019talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she muttered, crossing her arms across her chest as to fight off a chill. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p><p>Whether or not she meant that question for you, you stood up from the couch and spun to face her, flashing a small smile at her. \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine. Just personal stuff.\u201d You turned back towards Harry, at a loss as to how to say anything at all to him now with his girlfriend standing mere feet away. You felt a myriad of emotions, ranging from relief to hope to heartbreak, before swallowing your pride and shoving them back into the deep recesses of your head. You might have just confessed your love to him, but now was not the time for you (<i>Was it ever going to be?</i>). \u201cI\u2019ll see you later?\u201d</p><p>A tentative question, filled with \u2018<i>Are we okay? Will you talk to me? Does this change us? Am I going to lose you? Do you still need me?\u2019.\u00a0</i></p><p>An answer, assured, comforting, and to you, just a little bit hopeful. \u201cOf course. Always.\u201d</p><p><b>word\u00a0count: 4.2k</b></p></p>",

Not that you were actively hoping that she was exponentially less impressive or captivating in person, but you definitely never thought she&rsquo;d be able to live up to the flawless image of a woman that Harry had created in his endless fawning over her throughout the past few weeks. While he had initially come to you with a heart heavy with the fact that she allegedly claimed he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t her type&rdquo;, any little doubt anyone had harbored about her eventually falling to his charm was decidedly crushed at the vision of them standing hip-to-hip with his arm securely wrapped around her slim waist as they both laughed at whatever hilarious anecdote Mitch seemed to be reenacting in front of them. You, however, knew from the very beginning that they would end up together, because, well, with your luck, didn&rsquo;t they always?</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not even that pretty,&rdquo; Nick commented, taking another lengthy sip of the bright blue cocktail the bartender had concocted from behind the bar at one of the most exclusive clubs in Beverly Hills. Both of you were leaning against said bar, sipping away at each of your drinks as you casually inspected Harry and his new girlfriend from across the dance floor as they mingled with the rest of Harry&rsquo;s band in a booth.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry had made the decision to rent out the entire establishment in celebration of the fact that he had, just a couple weeks ago, concluded his first world tour as a solo artist. The numbers alone that the Harry Styles: Live on Tour expedition generated were mindblowing, and among the pain at seeing him so affectionate with his new girlfriend, you felt this immeasurable pride swell in your chest at the impact that this man was making on the world, a small stop in his venture to make the world a better place. Just the fact that he was able to donate over a million dollars to charities all around the world made you want to throw your own celebratory party for him with your own money (not that you were even close to being financially able to, but you know, it&rsquo;s the sentiment that counts).&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Grimmy,&rdquo; you admonished, shoving your and Harry&rsquo;s friend lightly with a little laugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p><p>Nick shrugged unabashedly, giving you a pointed look. &ldquo;Just sayin&rsquo;, Y/N. By the way he went on about her, I expected nothing short of a female Adonis on his arm tonight, and instead, I set eyes on this aspiring Instagram model who publicly celebrates every 10k follower milestone with a watered down shot of vodka on a livestream.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave Nick a dead stare, shaking your head slightly. &ldquo;That was&hellip; oddly specific.&rdquo; You set down your drink on the counter behind you, slumping down onto one of the high stools. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>actually</i> a uni student studying criminal psychology as a junior at USC, and she spends more time volunteering at the animal shelter down the street from her apartment than she does taking vodka shots.&rdquo; You pause. &ldquo;And she only has 736 followers, so your Instagram theory is completely wrong on more than one level.&rdquo;</p><p>Nick blinked slowly, tilting his head to the side. &ldquo;<i>That</i> was oddly specific.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just what Harry tells me,&rdquo; you muttered, grabbing your drink from the table and downing it all in one go. &ldquo;Not like <i>I </i>stalk her in my free time.&rdquo;</p><p>Nick sighed heavily, downing his drink before lifting his hand to get the bartender&rsquo;s attention and ordering two palomas. &ldquo;Listen, love, my point was that she isn&rsquo;t as eye-catching as H made her up to be.&rdquo; He thanked the bartender with a smile and a nod of gratitude before handing you a drink. &ldquo;On any account, she&rsquo;s no match to <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes, taking a small sip from your new cocktail before coughing at the burn it left sliding down your throat. &ldquo;That is way too much tequila.&rdquo;</p><p>Nick took a sip in response, licking his teeth before shrugging lightly and continuing on with his original point. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand why you won&rsquo;t just tell &lsquo;im you&rsquo;re completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with him so you can move along with your happily ever after, missy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;ll just casually walk up to him with a, &lsquo;<i>Hi, how are you, just dropping by to say how completely, one hundred percent, head-over-heels in love with you I am, have a nice day!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; you said sarcastically, taking another tentative sip of your paloma.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick scoffed. &ldquo;You can do it with a little more class than that, Y/N.&rdquo; You narrowed your eyes at him, opening your mouth to respond but being cut off. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re so afraid of, love! He&rsquo;s obviously very smitten with your cute little self, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone through all this trouble of procuring a cover-up girlfriend-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-to make it seem like he&rsquo;s completely in love with someone else, when in reality, he&rsquo;s just trying to draw you out with jealousy-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am <i>not</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-before he finally confesses that he&rsquo;s been trying to get with your arse since he met you all those years ago and fell for the way your eyes are <i>&lsquo;deep and complex like a flowing river&rsquo;</i> or how the sheen of your hair <i>&lsquo;looks golden under the perfect natural lighting&rsquo;</i> or some Jane Austen-esque shit like that.&rdquo;</p><p>You reached out and hit Nick on the shoulder, careful not to jostle your drink around too much as he held up his hands in surrender. &ldquo;Shut <i>up,</i> Nick!&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head in what appeared to be disbelief, taking a lengthy sip from his glass as if to prepare himself for what he was about to say to you. &ldquo;What is it that makes you think he doesn&rsquo;t feel the same way? Is it the family? Anne not fancy you much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Anne lo-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it Gem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Evie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So friends?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, <i>you </i>like me so-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you not like <i>him </i>enough?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I lo-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it the fame? Spotlight too much for ya?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nick, don&rsquo;t be-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I got it</i>. It&rsquo;s the Gucci, eh? Too lavish?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nick, I swear to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you should reconsider if it&rsquo;s the Gucci. His girlfriend at the mo&rsquo; seems to be just fine with it. Honestly-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>That</i>,&rdquo; you interrupt loudly, setting your glass down on the table. &ldquo;The <i>girlfriend</i>, Grim. It&rsquo;s the girlfriend part that makes me think he might not be as in love with me as I am with him. Call me crazy, but the last time I checked, you don&rsquo;t ask out someone if you&rsquo;ve fallen for someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>Nick paused, putting his drink next to yours on the table before leaning towards you and placing his hands on your legs as if to prove he&rsquo;s serious now. &ldquo;Babes, I am one of his best mates. Believe me when I say that what he feels for her doesn&rsquo;t even hold a candle to even an ounce of love I&rsquo;ve seen he has for you.&rdquo; His grip on you tightened, eyes boring into yours with an intensity so rare for someone as playful and fun-loving as him. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you tired of feeling so depressed? Ignored? <i>Loveless</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed deeply, Nick&rsquo;s words pulling at your heartstrings as you momentarily considered that maybe, just maybe, Harry felt more than what he&rsquo;s led on towards you, and you were being too ignorant to acknowledge it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not <i>loveless</i>, Nick.&rdquo; You shook your head, as if ridding any hopeful thought Nick had planted in your head. &ldquo;Besides, even if he did, at one point, like me back, it doesn&rsquo;t matter now. You said it yourself; he practically worships the ground Peyton walks on. Just because she&rsquo;s not as impressive as we thought she was, Harry obviously feels very strongly about her, or he would&rsquo;ve never talked about her the way he did.&rdquo; You paused, closing your eyes momentarily. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;m not a homewrecker, and I&rsquo;m not going to start just because I took too long to confess my feelings to him. As his best mate, and mine, you should respect that, Grimmy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As one of your best friends, that is the reason why I can&rsquo;t just sit here and watch on as you pine after a man who would drop everything for you in a second,&rdquo; Nick insisted, cupping your face in his hands and leaning even closer. &ldquo;I want what&rsquo;s best for him, and Peyton? She&rsquo;s not it. You are what&rsquo;s best for him. And that is why&hellip;&rdquo; You watched as he shut his eyes, taking in a deep dramatic breath as if preparing for something huge. You felt your heart begin to beat faster, knowing that when Nick put his mind to something, it was next to impossible to convince him out of it. &ldquo;You are going to talk to him. Tonight. Right now, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyebrows furrowed, reaching up to grasp his wrists and pull his hands away from your face. &ldquo;Even if I wanted to, what about Peyton?&rdquo;</p><p>A quick flash of a mischievous smirk flitted across his face, one of his eyes dropping into a cheeky wink. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll handle her.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, Nick abruptly got up from the bar stool and began to dramatically scream out the words of the rap song currently pounding through the speakers, drunkenly swaying his hips from side to side as he pretended to stumble his way across the dance floor towards Harry and Peyton. You watched as their entire table&rsquo;s attention was captured by Nick&rsquo;s gyrating figure as he reached their table, serenading Peyton with what you were positive were the wrong words along with Kanye West. &ldquo;<i>Eighteen years, eighteen years, she got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years&hellip;</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Watching Nick embarrass himself for a moment more, you took a deep breath and closed your eyes, beginning a mental pep talk to hype yourself up before you went over there. &lsquo;<i>Nick went through all this trouble to get you to talk to him, so get up off your ass, stop being a little bitch, and just talk to him. It&rsquo;s just Harry. He&rsquo;s your best friend. What could possibly go wrong?</i>&rsquo;</p><p>For a shot of extra luck (quite literally), you downed the rest of your obscenely strong drink in one go and shook your head to clear the resulting fog from your vision before getting up and making your way towards them. You felt like you needed to walk with purpose, as this might&rsquo;ve been the prelude to a defining moment in your and Harry&rsquo;s relationship, the thing that kickstarts the rest of your lives together (or just the prologue to your depressing autobiography, whichever seemed more plausible). But you probably just looked like how David did when he first set eyes on Goliath.</p><p>As you approached, you noticed that Nick had seamlessly executed his plan at coercing Peyton away from Harry&rsquo;s side and out onto the dance floor, their retreating figures visible as Harry watched amusedly from his seat. Nick continued to scream out Kanye West lyrics, having moved on from simple swaying to a whole routine consisting of thrusting and rolling his hips while spinning in a slow circle, an odd combination loosely inspired by the Magic Mike routine you&rsquo;d both witnessed at the strip club he&rsquo;d dragged you to a few days prior (fortunately or unfortunately, it was a bit of a toss-up). Needless to say, Peyton was certainly occupied.</p><p>&ldquo;H?&rdquo; you asked tentatively, rocking onto the heels of your feet as Harry turned his attention away from his best friend now animatedly attempting to engage Peyton in dancing with him instead of laughing at him.&nbsp;</p><p>Familiar green eyes settled on your face, your nervous smile considerably less enthusiastic than the bright grin that lit up Harry&rsquo;s face at the sight of you. Aside from the brief hug and introduction to his girlfriend at the beginning of the party, you hadn&rsquo;t had the chance to talk to him at all that night, instead choosing to drown yourself in a plethora of Nick&rsquo;s eclectic taste in cocktails up until this very moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; he exclaimed, immediately sliding over to make room for you in the booth. You settled down next to him, his arm pulling you into a tight side embrace with a small peck on your temple. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been? I haven&rsquo;t seen you all night.&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at his show of affection, shrugging as if you hadn&rsquo;t been staring at him love on his girlfriend for the past three hours. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a busy man,&rdquo; you responded lightly, shoving him playfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have time for commoners like me anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>He rolled his eyes, cupping your face in his giant hands and lightly squeezing your cheeks. &ldquo;Always have time for you, love.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, another person&rsquo;s voice breaks into your bubble with sarcastic offense. &ldquo;<i>Hi, Mitch. How are you, Mitch? Oh, I&rsquo;m doing great, Y/N, thank you so much for caring about literally anyone else but your lover boy over there.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes flashed to Mitch, who you admittedly hadn&rsquo;t really paid much mind to until he spoke up. He had a smug smirk on his face, knowing his comment about your &ldquo;lover boy&rdquo; was nearing dangerous territory of Harry getting suspicious. Then again, you were also well aware that Harry had been contentedly naive for however long you&rsquo;d been in love with him, with people like his entire band and Nick being privy to your affection and constantly pushing towards a very public confession.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shove off, Mitch,&rdquo; Harry laughed, throwing an arm on the back of the booth behind you. &ldquo;Peyton might hear you. Don&rsquo;t wanna get the missus upset, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>You felt yourself stiffen at the mention of his girlfriend, the impending confession weighing even heavier at the tip of your tongue. The familiar sensation of your heart cracking just a bit more made you slump down a bit in your seat, your smile transforming into a fake grimace. Your eyes met Mitch&rsquo;s across the table, and the sympathetic glance he sent your way didn&rsquo;t make you feel any better about what you were going to do. &lsquo;<i>Not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker, not a homewrecker&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;alright?&rdquo; Your attention was pulled back to the boy next to you, whose eyebrows were now furrowed in slight concern at your sudden shift in mood. It hurt just slightly knowing that he was so in tune with your emotions that he could detect the smallest changes in emotion in you, falsely convincing you that he just maybe paid as much attention to you as you did to him. &ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your lips into your mouth, a quick &lsquo;now or never&rsquo; flitting through your head before you felt the words fall out of your mouth at a pace way faster than normal. &ldquo;Actually, I need to talk t&rsquo;you about something.&rdquo;</p><p>The worry on his face just deepened at your response, turning his body towards you more and leaning in closer. &ldquo;Sure, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo; you hummed, suddenly very aware that you were sat in a very public club at a table with someone else that was most likely listening to every word you were saying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kinda important.&rdquo; You glanced around the perimeter of the club, eyes flitting over the spiral staircase in the corner of the room that led up to what appeared to be a much more private area of the club. &ldquo;Is there somewhere more private we could talk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; Harry answered, grabbing your hand and pulling you up from your seat before gently ushering you out of the booth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; he called to Mitch, who had been distracted chatting with one of Harry&rsquo;s tour assistants that had just approached the table. Mitch nodded in return, locking eyes with you and winking subtly before turning away completely.&nbsp;</p><p>The two of you made your way through the throng of his friends and colleagues dancing closely together to the beat of whatever new rap song the DJ had blaring through the speakers, Harry briefly being stopped multiple times by congratulations as he caught the attention of almost everyone you passed. He quickly thanked them, shaking hands with a few and halting completely to embrace others while you stood quietly behind him, silently giving yourself a mental pep talk about the best way to go about what you had to tell him. After all, there isn&rsquo;t really a &ldquo;Confessing You&rsquo;re In Love with Someone for Dummies&rdquo; to help you out.</p><p>Once you both broke out of the crowd, Harry took a loose hold of your hand again and pulled you towards the spiral staircase you had spotted earlier, checking behind him one last time before beginning to climb the steps two at a time with his long legs. As you ascended the stairs behind him, you glanced back down onto the club laid out under you, catching Nick&rsquo;s eyes as he continued to dance with Peyton and sending him a wide-eyed look of panic. He grinned back, sending you a thumbs-up and mouthing a &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; before Harry pulled you up onto the second floor and Nick fell out of view.&nbsp;</p><p>You faced a long, quiet hallway extending from both sides of the staircase, the floor lined with a deep red velvet carpet that cushioned yours and Harry&rsquo;s steps so that neither could be heard as he continued to lead you into the first room to your right.&nbsp;</p><p>It was what appeared to be a room reserved for private parties for small, exclusive groups of peoples, with a few couches and tables spread throughout the room and a small mini bar set up on the opposite side of the room, an impressive glass case stocked with foreign liquors you could neither recognize nor name.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry sat you down on the couch nearest to you, your figure sinking into the deep cushions as you took a seat next to him. The silence surrounding you was almost suffocating, your heartbeat racing as you suddenly realized that this was a make-or-break situation on your hands. After you confess, there were really only two outcomes: he&rsquo;d miraculously reciprocate your feelings, or he&rsquo;d reject you as gently as he could before rushing off to take comfort in his actual girlfriend for the rest of his life. Either way, you were unprepared to see what came out of your mouth after months, possibly even years, of suppressing every feeling of love or affection you&rsquo;d experienced towards him.&nbsp;</p><p>Your frantic train of thought was broken by the culprit of your racing heart himself, his hands placed casually on his knees as he turned towards you. &ldquo;What did y&rsquo;need to talk &lsquo;bout?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;W-Well&hellip;&rdquo; you began nervously, swallowing thickly before tucking a rogue strand of hair behind your ear. &ldquo;Okay, so, I didn&rsquo;t expect to tell you like this. I actually wasn&rsquo;t even planning to tell you at all tonight until Nick practically forced me-&rdquo;</p><p>A chuckle left Harry&rsquo;s mouth, his nose scrunching in the cute way that it normally did when he found something particularly amusing. &ldquo;Never let Grimmy of all people force you into things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; you countered, rolling your eyes. As much as you were dreading what was about to happen, you also knew that, in the back of your head, you always figured it&rsquo;d be Nick&rsquo;s doing if you ever confessed. Call it a hunch, but it was just in his person to push his friends to do the things they were terrified of. &ldquo;But I guess this time he had a point.&rdquo;</p><p>The amused grin remained on Harry&rsquo;s face, completely unaware of what you were about to say. &ldquo;And what point was that?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Deep breath</i>. &ldquo;That I need to stop being an emotional little bitch and finally confess to something that I&rsquo;ve known for quite some time now.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyebrows raised in surprise at your vulgar language, not expecting something like that out of you during what he figured was a serious situation. He opened his mouth to interrupt, but you knew that the only way you&rsquo;d ever actually say what you needed to was if you plowed through what you had already started. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of homewreckers, and never in my life have I ever wanted to be one, but my timing in life is just so inherently terrible that every time I even let myself think of telling you, you&rsquo;d suddenly come to me about a new girl that you&rsquo;d begun to like. Every single time, I&rsquo;ve just pushed whatever I was feeling to the back of my mind, because all I&rsquo;ve ever wanted for you was to be as happy as you could be, but I guess in the process, I&rsquo;ve kind of pushed off my own happiness, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry reached out a hand and laid it on your arm, all amusement gone from his face now as your words sunk in. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you talking &lsquo;bout?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m saying this because I expect something out of you, or if it&rsquo;s because Nick has been bothering me about it for weeks now and I&rsquo;m actually <i>very</i> drunk, or if I really just need to get this out of my system and into the universe, but&hellip;&rdquo; You paused. <i>Deep breath. Close your eyes. Let it out. Open</i>. &ldquo;I love you. And I have for quite some time now, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence. Then, a slow blink, a breathless stutter, a tight grip still on your forearm. &ldquo;W-What?&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a little giggle of disbelief, keeping your eyes locked onto his. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m kind of- well, in love with you. And it feels really good to say that out loud. Finally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like, actually? R-Really?&rdquo; Harry stuttered, his emerald eyes still wide with disbelief. It seemed as if his brain had short-circuited, his mind not completely able to comprehend what you had just said.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, really,&rdquo; you answered, slightly smiling in hopes that he had something (literally, anything) else to say to you. &ldquo;Listen, you don&rsquo;t have to say anything back. I know you&rsquo;re with Peyton, and this was completely uncalled for with the worst timing in the world, but&hellip;&rdquo; You let out a sigh, not knowing what else to do but shrug a bit hopelessly. &ldquo;I just needed to say that. For you, for me, I dunno. But I really needed to.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s train of thought seemed to finally catch up to present time, his expression transforming into a mix of surprise and confusion. He let go of his grip on your arm, his hands falling into his lap and twisting together. &ldquo;I-I just-&rdquo;</p><p>Before he could finish, a soft voice permeated the walls and caught your and his attention, your heart dropping as it got closer and closer to the door, more recognizable with each call. &ldquo;Harry? Are you up here?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes widened once again, this time in shock as he registered who was outside the door. You bit your lip nervously, heart falling at the knowledge that as soon as she found the two of you, any moment the two of you could&rsquo;ve had was now not going to happen. Your gaze flickered towards the door as you heard a knock, Harry&rsquo;s eyes following your own before- &ldquo;Ha- oh. There you are, bub, I&rsquo;ve been looking for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes flicked between Peyton, who was now standing in the doorway of the room, and you, who was now staring down at your feet in the hopes that your confession wouldn&rsquo;t reach the ears of the girl he was with. He seemed to contemplate something, his hand twitching towards you as if wanting to stay and talk through the eruption of complicated emotions you had just thrown at him, but after one more look at the petite girl waiting for a response, he stood up from the couch slowly. &ldquo;Y-Yeah, sorry, love. Y/N needed t&rsquo;talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she muttered, crossing her arms across her chest as to fight off a chill. &ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Whether or not she meant that question for you, you stood up from the couch and spun to face her, flashing a small smile at her. &ldquo;Yeah, everything&rsquo;s fine. Just personal stuff.&rdquo; You turned back towards Harry, at a loss as to how to say anything at all to him now with his girlfriend standing mere feet away. You felt a myriad of emotions, ranging from relief to hope to heartbreak, before swallowing your pride and shoving them back into the deep recesses of your head. You might have just confessed your love to him, but now was not the time for you (<i>Was it ever going to be?</i>). &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later?&rdquo;</p><p>A tentative question, filled with &lsquo;<i>Are we okay? Will you talk to me? Does this change us? Am I going to lose you? Do you still need me?&rsquo;.&nbsp;</i></p><p>An answer, assured, comforting, and to you, just a little bit hopeful. &ldquo;Of course. Always.&rdquo;</p><p><b>word&nbsp;count: 4.2k</b></p></p>",
