Seeing the joy on the kids&rsquo; faces as they met their favourite superhero in person was a privilege to photograph and everybody deserved to see it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;That necklace is beautiful,&rdquo; she said to one of the young girls, a grin on her lips. &ldquo;Did you make it yourself?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>The young girl nodded as she stared in wonder at Carol, who was kneeling down to be the same height as her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Dana, sweetie, do you want to give Captain Marvel something?&rdquo; a nurse said kindly, smiling down at the young girl. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana nodded enthusiastically, reaching into her pocket and pulling out some bracelets. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I made these for you,&rdquo; she said adorably, and I snapped a photo as she held out her hand to Carol, who was watching her with adoration. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;For me? Oh my!&rdquo; Carol accepted the two bracelets and studied them carefully. &ldquo;How lucky am I, Dana? These are gorgeous!&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana grinned, showing her missing teeth, and I felt my heart swell at how cute she was. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;You could keep one and give the other,&rdquo; she said, pausing to take a breath, &ldquo;give the other to someone else.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Really?

Dana joined in and I felt my heart warming at the sight. My eyes automatically drew to Carol as she stared at Dana lovingly, a grin on her face. She glanced my way, as if to say 'look how cute she is!&rsquo;, before looking back to Dana. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I was too distracted by Carol, though. She was absolutely amazing and I was insanely lucky to have her as my girlfriend. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>And maybe, I guess, I had fallen in love with her. </p><p><b>when you both tell each other 'I love you&rsquo;&hellip;</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;How is it going with the editing?&rdquo; Carol asked from the kitchen. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I looked up and saw her at her stove, cooking away.

I shut my laptop and went over to her, feeling guilty for not giving her the attention she deserved. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done for the night,&rdquo; I mumbled, wrapping my arms around her waist and leaning my head on her shoulder. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;ve got deadlines, I get that,&rdquo; she said reassuringly, glancing at me with a smile, before paying attention to the wok in front of her. &ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re here, I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled, feeling those familiar butterflies in my stomach as she finished stirring the sauce to some pasta dish she was putting together.

I laced mine around her shoulder, grinning up at her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Dinner is ready,&rdquo; she muttered, mirroring my grin as she looked down at me. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I almost didn&rsquo;t register what she said because as clich\u00e9 as it sounded, I was too distracted by her golden-brown eyes, staring into mine with love and adoration. I hadn&rsquo;t stopped thinking about what I had heard her say that night not long ago when she thought I was asleep. She loved me, but she hadn&rsquo;t said it yet. She moved slow, and I was sure it was because of me. So, I took the first step. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I said honestly. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She raised her eyebrows a little, but her smile didn&rsquo;t waiver. &ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded, the butterflies in my stomach flying higher and higher. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She nodded, swallowing visibly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good because I love you, too.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled and she leaned forward, closing the gap between us to seal the deal with a kiss.

I finished the chocolate bar before pulling the blanket over my shoulders, trying to concentrate on the TV. But my cramps were hurting too much. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I want to die,&rdquo; I groaned over-dramatically, pulling my hot water bottle out from under my blanket and turning so I was facing the ceiling instead of the TV.

I need the hot water bottle back.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;How about something better?&rdquo; Carol said, already moving to squeeze by my side on the couch. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She got under the blanket with me and rested a hand on my abdomen gently.

What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She slammed the fridge shut, making it tremble under her strength, before breathing out slowly. I noticed her hands were glowing, something they did when she was angry or frustrated, so I rested a hand on her forearm and pulled her close. I watched as the light faded and she leaned into me, her head in my shoulder. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;C'mon, let&rsquo;s go sit down,&rdquo; I said quietly into her ear, pressing a kiss to her neck before leading her to the couch. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I turned the TV off as she laid down, her head on my lap and facing the TV.

My heart broke as I watched her hurting, but she finally spoke, which made me hold off from doing anything further. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a shitty day and nothing is going right,&rdquo; she spoke quietly, clutching my hand tighter, pulling it close to her chest. &ldquo;My mind keeps going to places I don&rsquo;t want it to and I don&rsquo;t know what to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I continued to stoke her hair, knowing she liked the comforting feeling, and said, &ldquo;Everybody has those days where nothing goes right.

We can try to make them better though.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She sighed, using her other hand to wipe her tears before turning around in my lap, so she was looking up at me.

She was always so strong, but even superheroes had their moments of vulnerability. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;I wish I could take your pain away somehow.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol cuddled closer to me, if that was even possible, and said, &ldquo;I like it when you hold me.

She tightened her grip, making me step on her foot and elbow her again, harder.

She didn&rsquo;t know about my self-defence training, and for very good reason. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Y/N, who hurt you?&rdquo; she said through gritted teeth, her eyes tearing up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath, before opening them again and saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault.

Well, personal training, I guess. My instructor, Fatima, teaches me basic self-defence moves and I guess sometimes I take it a little too far and sustain some bruising, but nothing serious.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Nothing serious? Your hip is purple, Y/N!&rdquo; Carol shouted, letting go of my hands. &ldquo;Why the hell do you need to go to self-defence?&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Carol, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal,&rdquo; I said, keeping my voice at its normal volume. &ldquo;I just want to be able to protect myself.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I thought I&hellip; I try to protect the both of us, Y/N,&rdquo; Carol said, her voice lowering. &ldquo;Do I not do a good enough job?&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; I said, resting a hand on her knee. &ldquo;You keep me safe, Carol, but you&rsquo;re not always around. I want to be able to defend myself if you&rsquo;re not there.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol bit her lip, shaking her head as she looked away from me. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you hid this from me&hellip; When exactly am I not here, Y/N? I try my hardest!&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I clenched my jaw, feeling my own eyes tearing up now. &ldquo;Carol, this isn&rsquo;t about you. I know you do the best you can. But you&rsquo;re not my personal bodyguard.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;What are you scared of?!&rdquo; she asked, meeting my eyes desperately. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Your enemies! Okay?! I&rsquo;m scared of your enemies!&rdquo; I yelled, a tear escaping my eye. &ldquo;Have you forgotten when that HYDRA agent broke into our flat and tried to kill me five months ago?!&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol&rsquo;s angry expression faded as she saw me being deadly serious. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t there, Carol! And I&rsquo;m not blaming you! But if I had known, even a <i>little </i>bit of knowledge on how to protect myself, maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t have almost died! I was terrified, okay?! I don&rsquo;t want to feel like that again!&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol watched as I regained control of my breathing and I didn&rsquo;t know what else to say. I wiped away any stray tears of mine and stood up, wincing a little at my sore body. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t up to you,&rdquo; I said, angrily. &ldquo;This is <i>my </i>choice.

I sighed as I crawled into our bed, staring at the ceiling. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She didn&rsquo;t get to tell me what to do this time. She wouldn&rsquo;t understand. She&rsquo;s this omnipotent being with the ability to hurt anyone who tried to hurt her. She didn&rsquo;t understand what it was like to be vulnerable. She didn&rsquo;t get to tell me what to do. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>This was <i>my </i>choice. </p><p><b>when you&rsquo;re mad at her&hellip;</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just three weeks and I&rsquo;ll be back before you know it,&rdquo; Carol tried to sound hopeful, but I couldn&rsquo;t even look at her without feeling the urge to yell. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She was leaving for yet another mission assigned by S.H.I.E.L.D. - by Nick Fury himself. She had only just come back from a mission a week ago and was already preparing to leave for another. I knew it came with the job. She was a superhero, she saved people, made them feel safe. But it wasn&rsquo;t fair. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I knew she would have to leave at times, I understood why. But it didn&rsquo;t make it any easier. At first, I could say goodbye and see her again without feeling anything other than longing. I missed her, but she always came back. Now, I only ever felt angry and I hated it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; she called, her voice soft and careful as she stepped closer to me. &ldquo;Is that okay?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I breathed out slowly before looking to her. &ldquo;When have you ever needed my permission?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She seemed taken aback as she held my stare with uncertainty. &ldquo;If you tell me not to go, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I searched her eyes for something, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure what. I just knew that the longer I stared at the golden flecks swirling around, the more I found this whole thing funny. I even let out a little chuckle. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; she asked, furrowing her brows. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shook my head distastefully. &ldquo;How much of an arsehole would I be if I told you not to go?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She stepped forward, but I stepped back. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;You said I could tell you not to go, but we both know that&rsquo;s not true at all,&rdquo; I said harshly, glaring at her as my sight grew blurry with tears. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s selfish of me. To deny some poor planet out there of your help. You can save them. Why would I stop you from going? Because I miss you? How pathetic of me.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Y/N, that&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; she said instantly, grabbing my hand and squeezing it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s how it is,&rdquo; I said, yanking my hand away. &ldquo;Forget it. Three weeks, right? Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll see you in three weeks, Carol.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Y/N, please don&rsquo;t be like this,&rdquo; she tried to say, frowning, but I ignored her as I turned around and left our bedroom, heading to the kitchen to cool off. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I hated that I could never ask her to stay. I wished she would, but she couldn&rsquo;t. And there was nothing I could do about it. \u00a0</p><p><b>when you&rsquo;re in an argument + when she gets jealous&hellip;</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I pursed my lips as I assembled my burger. I glanced up through my eyelashes, seeing Carol sat on the couch, engrossed in the television. I narrowed my eyes with annoyance before looking back to my burger, putting some lettuce and onions on it. I headed to the fridge to grab the jar of pickles and set it on the counter, attempting to open it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I groaned as I twisted with all my might, but the stupid lid wouldn&rsquo;t budge. It was a brand new jar and I had no upper body strength whatsoever which made me sigh. I <i>really </i>wanted pickles, they were my favourite. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sucked up a deep breath and tried again, only to no avail. I clenched my jaw, using a tea towel to try and develop a grip before attempting to open it again. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I muttered, my stubbornness getting the best of me. No way in hell was I going to ask Carol for help. Not after we&rsquo;d just had a stupid argument about how she never emptied the dishwasher. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I used a knife to try and hit it against the lid, before attempting to open it again, but of course, nothing. I breathed out with annoyance and gave up, finishing adding sauce to my burger before taking a bite out of it. It was tasty, but damn, I really wanted pickles. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I rolled my eyes before setting down my burger and grabbing the jar. I headed to Carol, who paid no attention to me until I cleared my throat loudly. She glanced at me, paused the TV, and gave me an expressionless stare. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; she asked bitterly. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes in front of her as I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t open the pickle jar.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She suppressed a smirk as she raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh, so you want my help?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I glared at her. &ldquo;Are you going to open it or not?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She smiled smugly, shaking her head. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m alright, but thanks for asking.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed and rolled my eyes before turning around, pissed at how childish she was acting. I set the jar back on the counter and frowned, really wanting the damn pickles. Before I could brainstorm another way to open the jar, I heard a knock on the flat door. I glanced at Carol, seeing she was invested in the TV again, so I decided to answer the door. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>When I opened it, I almost closed it again. It was our neighbour, Cole, who had a helpless crush on me and would nonstop flirt with me, even in front of Carol, who he knew was my girlfriend. I tried my best to avoid him, but there was only so much I could do when he lived next to us. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Cole, what can I do for you?&rdquo; I asked, forcing a smile his way. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He smirked, eyes checking me out, causing me to grip the door handle out of annoyance. &ldquo;Y/N, you look as gorgeous as ever.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed. &ldquo;Do you need something?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He nodded and held out some letters. &ldquo;Your mail got delivered to me by accident. I thought I&rsquo;d return it like the amazing neighbour I am.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I accepted the mail, setting it on the table by the door. &ldquo;Gee, thanks, Cole.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Anything for a pretty lady like yourself,&rdquo; he said flirtatiously, smiling cockily. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Usually I would have slammed the door in his face by now, but I stood up straight, smiling for real. &ldquo;Anything, you say?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He chuckled, though was confused. &ldquo;I guess, why?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Can you open my pickle jar?&rdquo; I blurted out. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>His eyes widened, before his cocky smile returned. &ldquo;I-&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a literal pickle jar,&rdquo; I told him, giving him a knowing look, &ldquo;before you get any ideas.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He grinned. &ldquo;A damsel in distress? Of course I will help you, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He followed me to the kitchen, going on about how he was happy to be my knight in shining armour. I nodded along like I was listening, but really I was thinking about the pickles I was finally going to be able to eat. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I said, passing him the jar. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He opened it without a struggle before handing it back to me. I smiled to myself, setting the jar on the counter. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said, giving him an appreciative smile. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Anytime, lovely lady,&rdquo; he said obnoxiously, sliding closer to me, forcing me to step back uncomfortably. &ldquo;Say&hellip; why are Carol&rsquo;s eyes glowing like that?&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I followed his gaze and saw Carol still sat on the couch, but now she was looking our way, her eyes glowing golden. I shook my head and rolled my eyes, knowing she was jealous. As fun as it was to piss her off, I really didn&rsquo;t want to have to deal with her photon blasting Cole through the wall. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Cole, thanks for your help once again,&rdquo; I said, pushing him towards the door. &ldquo;And thanks for the mail.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He was intrigued by Carol&rsquo;s eyes, but eventually got the hint when I shoved him into the hallway. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. I guess I&rsquo;ll see you around?&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I forced a smile. &ldquo;Maybe. Bye.&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shut the door before he could say anything else and sighed before heading back to the kitchen, looking forward to eating my burger finally. Only, when I got there, I saw Carol stood by the counter, a hand resting on the jar and glowing, heating it up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Carol!&rdquo; I shouted, shoving her away from it, before trying to grab the jar, only to yank my hand away with annoyance because it was still steaming hot. I frowned, looking into the jar to see all of the pickles gooey and gross. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;No pickles,&rdquo; she said, and I looked up to see her shrugging, unbothered. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I glared at her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting like a child! If you had just opened the jar <i>for </i>me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to ask Cole! You&rsquo;re a jealous, annoying freakin&rsquo; child, ugh!&rdquo; I looked back to my pickles, frowning again. &ldquo;I finally got the jar open, damn&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I heard Carol groan and was about to fight her about it, but I saw her heading to the door. I followed her, watching as she put on her leather jacket and grabbed her car keys. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Where are you going now?&rdquo; I asked, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;First you ruin my burger and now you&rsquo;re just gonna leave?&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to buy you some damn pickles,&rdquo; she got out through gritted teeth, a little guiltily, before leaving the flat, slamming the door behind her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I stood there for a moment, arms crossed as I stared at the door, only to hate myself for smiling and not feeling so mad anymore. \u00a0</p><p><b>when you get jealous&hellip; </b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed, staring at the bannister and wondering why I was here. I wasn&rsquo;t one for parties and\u2013 actually? Scratch that. I wasn&rsquo;t one for parties where the freakin&rsquo; Avengers attended. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol and I were at a party being hosted by the one and only Tony Stark and it should have been a dream come true, except it was the seventh party I&rsquo;d been to and the same thing happened every time. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol was amazing and I loved her, but she was oblivious to the fact that she&rsquo;d leave me out and I would feel out of place. She loved the Avengers and would always hang out with them, leaving me to attempt to mingle with people I didn&rsquo;t know. So, I always found myself hiding in this same spot for most of the time \u2013 the staircase. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I was deciding what I could possibly do to pass time when the door opened, startling me and making me sit up straight on the steps. It was Natasha Romanoff. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I felt my cheeks grow warm as I said, &ldquo;Erm, sorry, I can go if\u2013&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She shook her head, smiling softly. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine, sorry to disturb.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so she closed the door, stepping inside, and the music from the party went back to being muffled in the distance. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;You okay over here?&rdquo; she asked, a hint of concern in her voice. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded unconvincingly. &ldquo;Erm, yeah. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be enjoying the party?&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She snickered, taking a seat a few steps below me.

You could never come in second place to any of us.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I frowned, glancing down at my hands again. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Have you told her how you feel?&rdquo; she asked gently. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled sadly. &ldquo;I could never do that. I don&rsquo;t want to be <i>that</i> girlfriend, you know? The jealous one who makes her girl feel bad for hanging out with her friends. I don&rsquo;t want to start an argument or anything. Besides, Carol doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m here, so I&rsquo;ll go back to the party later or something. It&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Natasha nodded. &ldquo;I get you, but you should try talking to her, Y/N. She loves you a lot and I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t mean to make you feel like this.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I know she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I agreed, before breathing out slowly. &ldquo;Maybe another time, Nat. For now, I think I&rsquo;ll stay here. Unless you wanna kick me out.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Nat laughed, beginning to stand up. &ldquo;The staircase is all yours, Y/N. I just wanted to check in on you.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled up at her as she approached the door. &ldquo;Thank you. And erm, please can you not mention any of this to Carol? I don&rsquo;t wanna freak her out.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Natasha smiled. &ldquo;I promise not to say anything.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded gratefully and watched her leave. I stayed sat on the staircase for another twenty minutes or so, just thinking. At first, I thought I should have made more of on effort instead of hiding, but then I was reminded of all the times before now when I had done that, and I&rsquo;d just ended up miserable. I hated that I felt second best to literal superheroes. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I finally returned to the party after sulking for a while, seeing the penthouse was pretty much the same save for the few extra smashed vases, probably from drunken dares. I saw the Avengers dotted around, all of them enjoying themselves to the fullest. Though I couldn&rsquo;t see Carol anywhere. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Y/N, there you are!&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Speak of the devil. I turned around and saw Carol approaching me, a concerned expression on her face. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; I said, smiling half-heartedly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She grabbed my hand, squeezing it gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you. I was hoping we could talk.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I saw the seriousness in her eyes and nodded, wondering what she wanted. I allowed her to lead me outside on the balcony. There was nobody out there which was probably why she took me there, and I found us both standing by the edge, leaning on the gate and looking out into the city. Tony Stark was one lucky man to be able to afford to see this view every day. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>It was a little chilly though, and Carol must have noticed because she shrugged off her jacket and gave it to me. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; I asked, reluctantly accepting the jacket. </p><p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201c</b>Super powers, remember?&ldquo; she reminded me, raising a glowing hand. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled before putting her jacket on, instantly in a trance because of her smell hugging me close. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&quot;What did you need?&rdquo; I asked, remembering why we were out here. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She frowned, holding both of my hands now. &ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m so sorry. Nat told me about what you said earlier.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I closed my eyes, sighing. &ldquo;God damn, Nat&hellip; it&rsquo;s literally in her job description to keep secrets and she can&rsquo;t keep this one thing to herself&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Y/N\u2013&rdquo;</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;Look, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I said,&rdquo; I said, opening my eyes and looking into Carol&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Nat caught me at a bad time. I was just venting. I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol shook her head, lifting her hand to rest against my cheek. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not acceptable. I didn&rsquo;t realise I was neglecting you. I just get so excited around the others and I never meant to leave you out. I don&rsquo;t want you to feel bad.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I rested my hand on hers, pulling it from my face and kissing it gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Carol. Jealousy is an ugly colour on everyone. Especially me.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol sighed quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. You mean the world to me, Y/N. You&rsquo;re always first place in my mind. It&rsquo;s not even a competition. You&rsquo;d win every time.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I cracked a smile. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I love you because you get me,&rdquo; she continued, her eyes glistening with honesty. &ldquo;You get me more than the Avengers. Yeah, they&rsquo;re pretty cool, but you&rsquo;re the one who knows me best. You know I like my blankets put in the dryer to warm them up before bed, or that I like to wear my Goose-themed slippers around the flat. Or that I like to be held when I&rsquo;ve had a rough day. You know all of these things and more. They don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I wrapped my arms around her shoulders, allowing her to wrap hers around my waist and pull me close to her, so our bodies were practically touching. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; she said quietly, her hazel eyes meeting mine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>My heart was beating faster than usual. &ldquo;I love you, too. And you&rsquo;re forgiven.&rdquo; </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She smiled, her eyes squinting adorably, before leaning forward to close the gap between us. Her lips moved in perfect rhythm with mine and I felt her grasp on my waist tighten as she pulled us as close as possible. Any chill in the air that I felt was no longer there, and when I smiled, unfortunately breaking the kiss, I realised she was glowing golden and warming me up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;I will never get used to that,&rdquo; I said, letting out a small laugh as I saw her whole self lighting up in the dark. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>&ldquo;What can I say? You have that effect on me,&rdquo; she said knowingly, a smug smile on her lips. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I laughed and shook my head at how cringey she was. She grinned and pressed a kiss to my forehead before pulling me close again, the two of us hugging and looking out over the balcony. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I loved her so much.</p>",

Eventually though, I heard her speaking. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI love you so much, Y/N,\u201d she whispered, and I realised she must have thought I was asleep because she sounded so sure of herself and I felt her moving strands of hair from my face. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you eventually, I promise. Not yet. But I love you. I\u2019ll stay forever, if you\u2019ll have me.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I felt her lips press to my forehead before she tucked her head into my shoulder. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cGod, Carol, you\u2019re such a nerd,\u201d she mumbled to herself, and I truly had to resist the urge to smile. </p><p><i><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She loves me. </i></p><p><b>when you realise you love her\u2026</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I continued to take photos of Carol, or \u2018Captain Marvel\u2019 I guess, as she met with the sick children at the children\u2019s hospital. I was covering the story for the local paper \u2013 Captain Marvel paying a visit to the children\u2019s hospital. It was sweet and I was happy to do it. Seeing the joy on the kids\u2019 faces as they met their favourite superhero in person was a privilege to photograph and everybody deserved to see it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cThat necklace is beautiful,\u201d she said to one of the young girls, a grin on her lips. \u201cDid you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>The young girl nodded as she stared in wonder at Carol, who was kneeling down to be the same height as her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cDana, sweetie, do you want to give Captain Marvel something?\u201d a nurse said kindly, smiling down at the young girl. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana nodded enthusiastically, reaching into her pocket and pulling out some bracelets. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI made these for you,\u201d she said adorably, and I snapped a photo as she held out her hand to Carol, who was watching her with adoration. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cFor me? Oh my!\u201d Carol accepted the two bracelets and studied them carefully. \u201cHow lucky am I, Dana? These are gorgeous!\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana grinned, showing her missing teeth, and I felt my heart swell at how cute she was. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou could keep one and give the other,\u201d she said, pausing to take a breath, \u201cgive the other to someone else.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cReally?

I forgot about my camera for a moment, as I watched Carol put one bracelet on her wrist and hold the other. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWell, I guess that means I have to give this to someone I love!\u201d she said, eyebrows raised with excitement, making Dana laugh. \u201cIs that okay with you?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana nodded eagerly, causing Carol to laugh all over again. Dana joined in and I felt my heart warming at the sight. My eyes automatically drew to Carol as she stared at Dana lovingly, a grin on her face. She glanced my way, as if to say 'look how cute she is!\u2019, before looking back to Dana. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I was too distracted by Carol, though. She was absolutely amazing and I was insanely lucky to have her as my girlfriend. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>And maybe, I guess, I had fallen in love with her. </p><p><b>when you both tell each other 'I love you\u2019\u2026</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHow is it going with the editing?\u201d Carol asked from the kitchen. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I looked up and saw her at her stove, cooking away. She had invited me over, wanting to cook me dinner at her place, and here I was, doing work. I shut my laptop and went over to her, feeling guilty for not giving her the attention she deserved. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cIt\u2019s done for the night,\u201d I mumbled, wrapping my arms around her waist and leaning my head on her shoulder. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019ve got deadlines, I get that,\u201d she said reassuringly, glancing at me with a smile, before paying attention to the wok in front of her. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re here, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled, feeling those familiar butterflies in my stomach as she finished stirring the sauce to some pasta dish she was putting together. She turned off the gas and set the spoon down before turning around and wrapping her arms around my waist. I laced mine around her shoulder, grinning up at her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cDinner is ready,\u201d she muttered, mirroring my grin as she looked down at me. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I almost didn\u2019t register what she said because as clich\u00e9 as it sounded, I was too distracted by her golden-brown eyes, staring into mine with love and adoration. I hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about what I had heard her say that night not long ago when she thought I was asleep. She loved me, but she hadn\u2019t said it yet. She moved slow, and I was sure it was because of me. So, I took the first step. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said honestly. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She raised her eyebrows a little, but her smile didn\u2019t waiver. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded, the butterflies in my stomach flying higher and higher. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She nodded, swallowing visibly. \u201cThat\u2019s good because I love you, too.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled and she leaned forward, closing the gap between us to seal the deal with a kiss. A wonderful, beautiful, amazing, <i>loving </i>kiss. </p><p><b>when she comforts you\u2026</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI hate everything,\u201d I mumbled into my couch cushion. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cExcept chocolate,\u201d Carol pointed out, approaching me on the couch before kneeling before me, a smile on her lips. She held out a chocolate bar. \u201cYou love chocolate.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Even if I felt like I was dying, my period killing me as each second passed, nothing could stop me from smiling at how thoughtful Carol was. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I accepted the chocolate bar, already taking the wrapper off. \u201cI love you so much, you absolute babe.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She laughed and took a seat at the end of the couch, lifting my feet before setting them on her lap. I finished the chocolate bar before pulling the blanket over my shoulders, trying to concentrate on the TV. But my cramps were hurting too much. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI want to die,\u201d I groaned over-dramatically, pulling my hot water bottle out from under my blanket and turning so I was facing the ceiling instead of the TV. I tossed the hot water bottle across the room with annoyance, mumbling, \u201cPointless piece of shit.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cBabe, do you\u2013\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said sharply, sighing with annoyance.

I felt her hand heating up slowly, eventually staying at the perfect temperature and soothing the cramps that were once taking over. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cOh my god\u2026,\u201d I said, closing my eyes in relief. \u201cThat feels so good.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I heard Carol chuckle from beside me and I opened my eyes to turn to her. She was smiling, her eyes never leaving mine. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cSorry for being a bitch,\u201d I said, resting my hand on hers. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol suppressed a laugh, kissing the tip of my nose. \u201cI know, Y/N.

I looked away from the screen and saw Carol cursing to herself as she bent down to the floor, only to stand up, holding a spoon. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cStupid spoon,\u201d she mumbled, throwing it into the sink with a loud <i>clang</i>. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I noticed how annoyed she looked as she put the yoghurt she got out back into the fridge, probably changing her mind on eating it, but when she opened the fridge, an orange juice carton fell out onto the floor. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d she yelled, aggressively picking the carton from the floor and shoving it into the fridge with anger. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCarol,\u201d I said softly, standing up and going to her. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just juice. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She slammed the fridge shut, making it tremble under her strength, before breathing out slowly. I noticed her hands were glowing, something they did when she was angry or frustrated, so I rested a hand on her forearm and pulled her close. I watched as the light faded and she leaned into me, her head in my shoulder. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cC'mon, let\u2019s go sit down,\u201d I said quietly into her ear, pressing a kiss to her neck before leading her to the couch. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I turned the TV off as she laid down, her head on my lap and facing the TV. I pulled the blanket on top of her, wrapping her up, before holding one of her hands and running my other hand through her hair. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou wanna tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked gently, not wanting to push her into speaking. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She didn\u2019t say anything at first, so I assumed she wasn\u2019t in the mood, but then I saw her sniffle and realised tears were running down her cheeks. My heart broke as I watched her hurting, but she finally spoke, which made me hold off from doing anything further. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m having a shitty day and nothing is going right,\u201d she spoke quietly, clutching my hand tighter, pulling it close to her chest. \u201cMy mind keeps going to places I don\u2019t want it to and I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I continued to stoke her hair, knowing she liked the comforting feeling, and said, \u201cEverybody has those days where nothing goes right. It sucks, but without them, we can\u2019t appreciate the good days. It\u2019s horrible, but we can\u2019t get rid of them. We can try to make them better though.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She sighed, using her other hand to wipe her tears before turning around in my lap, so she was looking up at me.

I saw an absent look in her eyes as she continued. \u201cThey almost convinced me that I was one of them. I know it was a long time ago, but I can\u2019t help but think\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cThink what, Carol?\u201d I asked, holding her gaze. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She blinked and her glassy eyes released another tear. \u201cWhat if they got away with it? Successfully made me forget about my life here? I could still be killing innocents right now if I didn\u2019t realise the truth.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She sat up before I could say anything and I watched as she leaned into her hands, taking a deep breath. I frowned, rubbing her back slowly as she tried to get herself together. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou\u2019re having an off day and that can put your thoughts in some bad places,\u201d I told her, pressing a kiss to her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about the what if\u2019s. It\u2019s not helping. You\u2019re just overthinking.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI know,\u201d she mumbled, crawling back onto my lap, \u201cbut I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I wrapped my arms around her as she tucked her head into my neck, sniffling slightly. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, but try focusing on the present,\u201d I said gently. \u201cThink about what you have.

Don\u2019t think about anything else but now.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I felt her nod into my chest and I sighed quietly, feeling guilty that I couldn\u2019t think to do anything else. I couldn\u2019t imagine what she\u2019d been through and how it had affected her. She was always so strong, but even superheroes had their moments of vulnerability. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI wish I could take your pain away somehow.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol cuddled closer to me, if that was even possible, and said, \u201cI like it when you hold me.

I gasped as she tried to cut off my breathing, but I remembered what she taught me and elbowed her in the stomach before trying to step aside. She tightened her grip, making me step on her foot and elbow her again, harder. She shoved me off and I turned around, only to be charged at and thrown to the floor \u2013 thankfully there were mats otherwise that definitely would have hurt more than it did. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou need to regain control otherwise your attacker could come and do, well, that,\u201d Fatima explained, hands on her knees as she caught her breath. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cGotcha,\u201d I said, giving her a thumbs up, all whilst groaning and clutching my back. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna leave a bruise\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, I can go easier on you,\u201d Fatima said, helping me to stand up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shook my head immediately. \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t.

Now, I only ever felt angry and I hated it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N?\u201d she called, her voice soft and careful as she stepped closer to me. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I breathed out slowly before looking to her. \u201cWhen have you ever needed my permission?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She seemed taken aback as she held my stare with uncertainty. \u201cIf you tell me not to go, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I searched her eyes for something, though I wasn\u2019t sure what. I just knew that the longer I stared at the golden flecks swirling around, the more I found this whole thing funny. I even let out a little chuckle. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked, furrowing her brows. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shook my head distastefully. \u201cHow much of an arsehole would I be if I told you not to go?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She stepped forward, but I stepped back. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou said I could tell you not to go, but we both know that\u2019s not true at all,\u201d I said harshly, glaring at her as my sight grew blurry with tears. \u201cThat\u2019s selfish of me. To deny some poor planet out there of your help. You can save them. Why would I stop you from going? Because I miss you? How pathetic of me.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d she said instantly, grabbing my hand and squeezing it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI know it isn\u2019t, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d I said, yanking my hand away. \u201cForget it. Three weeks, right? Well, I guess I\u2019ll see you in three weeks, Carol.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, please don\u2019t be like this,\u201d she tried to say, frowning, but I ignored her as I turned around and left our bedroom, heading to the kitchen to cool off. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I hated that I could never ask her to stay. I wished she would, but she couldn\u2019t. And there was nothing I could do about it. \u00a0</p><p><b>when you\u2019re in an argument + when she gets jealous\u2026</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I pursed my lips as I assembled my burger. I glanced up through my eyelashes, seeing Carol sat on the couch, engrossed in the television. I narrowed my eyes with annoyance before looking back to my burger, putting some lettuce and onions on it. I headed to the fridge to grab the jar of pickles and set it on the counter, attempting to open it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I groaned as I twisted with all my might, but the stupid lid wouldn\u2019t budge. It was a brand new jar and I had no upper body strength whatsoever which made me sigh. I <i>really </i>wanted pickles, they were my favourite. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sucked up a deep breath and tried again, only to no avail. I clenched my jaw, using a tea towel to try and develop a grip before attempting to open it again. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d I muttered, my stubbornness getting the best of me. No way in hell was I going to ask Carol for help. Not after we\u2019d just had a stupid argument about how she never emptied the dishwasher. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I used a knife to try and hit it against the lid, before attempting to open it again, but of course, nothing. I breathed out with annoyance and gave up, finishing adding sauce to my burger before taking a bite out of it. It was tasty, but damn, I really wanted pickles. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I rolled my eyes before setting down my burger and grabbing the jar. I headed to Carol, who paid no attention to me until I cleared my throat loudly. She glanced at me, paused the TV, and gave me an expressionless stare. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked bitterly. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes in front of her as I said, \u201cI can\u2019t open the pickle jar.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She suppressed a smirk as she raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh, so you want my help?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I glared at her. \u201cAre you going to open it or not?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She smiled smugly, shaking her head. \u201cI think I\u2019m alright, but thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed and rolled my eyes before turning around, pissed at how childish she was acting. I set the jar back on the counter and frowned, really wanting the damn pickles. Before I could brainstorm another way to open the jar, I heard a knock on the flat door. I glanced at Carol, seeing she was invested in the TV again, so I decided to answer the door. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>When I opened it, I almost closed it again. It was our neighbour, Cole, who had a helpless crush on me and would nonstop flirt with me, even in front of Carol, who he knew was my girlfriend. I tried my best to avoid him, but there was only so much I could do when he lived next to us. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCole, what can I do for you?\u201d I asked, forcing a smile his way. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He smirked, eyes checking me out, causing me to grip the door handle out of annoyance. \u201cY/N, you look as gorgeous as ever.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed. \u201cDo you need something?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He nodded and held out some letters. \u201cYour mail got delivered to me by accident. I thought I\u2019d return it like the amazing neighbour I am.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I accepted the mail, setting it on the table by the door. \u201cGee, thanks, Cole.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cAnything for a pretty lady like yourself,\u201d he said flirtatiously, smiling cockily. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Usually I would have slammed the door in his face by now, but I stood up straight, smiling for real. \u201cAnything, you say?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He chuckled, though was confused. \u201cI guess, why?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCan you open my pickle jar?\u201d I blurted out. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>His eyes widened, before his cocky smile returned. \u201cI-\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cIt\u2019s a literal pickle jar,\u201d I told him, giving him a knowing look, \u201cbefore you get any ideas.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He grinned. \u201cA damsel in distress? Of course I will help you, Y/N.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He followed me to the kitchen, going on about how he was happy to be my knight in shining armour. I nodded along like I was listening, but really I was thinking about the pickles I was finally going to be able to eat. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, passing him the jar. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He opened it without a struggle before handing it back to me. I smiled to myself, setting the jar on the counter. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, giving him an appreciative smile. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cAnytime, lovely lady,\u201d he said obnoxiously, sliding closer to me, forcing me to step back uncomfortably. \u201cSay\u2026 why are Carol\u2019s eyes glowing like that?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I followed his gaze and saw Carol still sat on the couch, but now she was looking our way, her eyes glowing golden. I shook my head and rolled my eyes, knowing she was jealous. As fun as it was to piss her off, I really didn\u2019t want to have to deal with her photon blasting Cole through the wall. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCole, thanks for your help once again,\u201d I said, pushing him towards the door. \u201cAnd thanks for the mail.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He was intrigued by Carol\u2019s eyes, but eventually got the hint when I shoved him into the hallway. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I guess I\u2019ll see you around?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I forced a smile. \u201cMaybe. Bye.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shut the door before he could say anything else and sighed before heading back to the kitchen, looking forward to eating my burger finally. Only, when I got there, I saw Carol stood by the counter, a hand resting on the jar and glowing, heating it up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCarol!\u201d I shouted, shoving her away from it, before trying to grab the jar, only to yank my hand away with annoyance because it was still steaming hot. I frowned, looking into the jar to see all of the pickles gooey and gross. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cNo pickles,\u201d she said, and I looked up to see her shrugging, unbothered. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I glared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a child! If you had just opened the jar <i>for </i>me, I wouldn\u2019t have had to ask Cole! You\u2019re a jealous, annoying freakin\u2019 child, ugh!\u201d I looked back to my pickles, frowning again. \u201cI finally got the jar open, damn\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I heard Carol groan and was about to fight her about it, but I saw her heading to the door. I followed her, watching as she put on her leather jacket and grabbed her car keys. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d I asked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cFirst you ruin my burger and now you\u2019re just gonna leave?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy you some damn pickles,\u201d she got out through gritted teeth, a little guiltily, before leaving the flat, slamming the door behind her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I stood there for a moment, arms crossed as I stared at the door, only to hate myself for smiling and not feeling so mad anymore. \u00a0</p><p><b>when you get jealous\u2026 </b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed, staring at the bannister and wondering why I was here. I wasn\u2019t one for parties and\u2013 actually? Scratch that. I wasn\u2019t one for parties where the freakin\u2019 Avengers attended. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol and I were at a party being hosted by the one and only Tony Stark and it should have been a dream come true, except it was the seventh party I\u2019d been to and the same thing happened every time. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol was amazing and I loved her, but she was oblivious to the fact that she\u2019d leave me out and I would feel out of place. She loved the Avengers and would always hang out with them, leaving me to attempt to mingle with people I didn\u2019t know. So, I always found myself hiding in this same spot for most of the time \u2013 the staircase. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I was deciding what I could possibly do to pass time when the door opened, startling me and making me sit up straight on the steps. It was Natasha Romanoff. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I felt my cheeks grow warm as I said, \u201cErm, sorry, I can go if\u2013\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She shook her head, smiling softly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, sorry to disturb.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I didn\u2019t know what to say, so she closed the door, stepping inside, and the music from the party went back to being muffled in the distance. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou okay over here?\u201d she asked, a hint of concern in her voice. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded unconvincingly. \u201cErm, yeah. Shouldn\u2019t you be enjoying the party?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She snickered, taking a seat a few steps below me. She leaned back against the bannister, glancing up at me with a raised eyebrow. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I cracked a small smile. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She sighed, her smile fading. \u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong? Are you and Carol fighting or something?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She shrugged. \u201cYou guys haven\u2019t exactly been close this evening. And you\u2019re sat in here alone when she\u2019s out there having fun.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I looked down at my hands in my lap, avoiding Nat\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re fine\u2026\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I met her amused expression. \u201cIt\u2019s silly.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>A hint of a smile was on her lips as she said, \u201cMost of my life is serious, so enlighten me with this silliness of yours.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I mirrored her expression before looking ahead of me. \u201cIt\u2019s just, whenever we get invited to a party with you guys, I feel like Carol prefers hanging out with all of you instead of me. She just seems more interested in you guys and I mean, I get it. You\u2019re the Avengers. But I don\u2019t know, I feel stupid for getting jealous. You all know her better than I do and that\u2019s why I feel left out. Like I\u2019m second place or something.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I looked to Natasha and saw her giving me a knowing look. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cOkay, that totally wasn\u2019t silly, so I\u2019m slightly annoyed you got my hopes up,\u201d she began, making me chuckle, \u201cand Carol adores you, Y/N. You could never come in second place to any of us.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I frowned, glancing down at my hands again. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHave you told her how you feel?\u201d she asked gently. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled sadly. \u201cI could never do that. I don\u2019t want to be <i>that</i> girlfriend, you know? The jealous one who makes her girl feel bad for hanging out with her friends. I don\u2019t want to start an argument or anything. Besides, Carol doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, so I\u2019ll go back to the party later or something. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Natasha nodded. \u201cI get you, but you should try talking to her, Y/N. She loves you a lot and I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t mean to make you feel like this.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI know she doesn\u2019t,\u201d I agreed, before breathing out slowly. \u201cMaybe another time, Nat. For now, I think I\u2019ll stay here. Unless you wanna kick me out.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Nat laughed, beginning to stand up. \u201cThe staircase is all yours, Y/N. I just wanted to check in on you.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled up at her as she approached the door. \u201cThank you. And erm, please can you not mention any of this to Carol? I don\u2019t wanna freak her out.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Natasha smiled. \u201cI promise not to say anything.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded gratefully and watched her leave. I stayed sat on the staircase for another twenty minutes or so, just thinking. At first, I thought I should have made more of on effort instead of hiding, but then I was reminded of all the times before now when I had done that, and I\u2019d just ended up miserable. I hated that I felt second best to literal superheroes. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I finally returned to the party after sulking for a while, seeing the penthouse was pretty much the same save for the few extra smashed vases, probably from drunken dares. I saw the Avengers dotted around, all of them enjoying themselves to the fullest. Though I couldn\u2019t see Carol anywhere. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, there you are!\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Speak of the devil. I turned around and saw Carol approaching me, a concerned expression on her face. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHere I am,\u201d I said, smiling half-heartedly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She grabbed my hand, squeezing it gently. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you. I was hoping we could talk.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I saw the seriousness in her eyes and nodded, wondering what she wanted. I allowed her to lead me outside on the balcony. There was nobody out there which was probably why she took me there, and I found us both standing by the edge, leaning on the gate and looking out into the city. Tony Stark was one lucky man to be able to afford to see this view every day. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>It was a little chilly though, and Carol must have noticed because she shrugged off her jacket and gave it to me. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou sure?\u201d I asked, reluctantly accepting the jacket. </p><p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201c</b>Super powers, remember?\u201c she reminded me, raising a glowing hand. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled before putting her jacket on, instantly in a trance because of her smell hugging me close. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\"What did you need?\u201d I asked, remembering why we were out here. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She frowned, holding both of my hands now. \u201cY/N, I\u2019m so sorry. Nat told me about what you said earlier.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I closed my eyes, sighing. \u201cGod damn, Nat\u2026 it\u2019s literally in her job description to keep secrets and she can\u2019t keep this one thing to herself\u2026\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N\u2013\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter what I said,\u201d I said, opening my eyes and looking into Carol\u2019s. \u201cNat caught me at a bad time. I was just venting. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol shook her head, lifting her hand to rest against my cheek. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not acceptable. I didn\u2019t realise I was neglecting you. I just get so excited around the others and I never meant to leave you out. I don\u2019t want you to feel bad.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I rested my hand on hers, pulling it from my face and kissing it gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Carol. Jealousy is an ugly colour on everyone. Especially me.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol sighed quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You mean the world to me, Y/N. You\u2019re always first place in my mind. It\u2019s not even a competition. You\u2019d win every time.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I cracked a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI love you because you get me,\u201d she continued, her eyes glistening with honesty. \u201cYou get me more than the Avengers. Yeah, they\u2019re pretty cool, but you\u2019re the one who knows me best. You know I like my blankets put in the dryer to warm them up before bed, or that I like to wear my Goose-themed slippers around the flat. Or that I like to be held when I\u2019ve had a rough day. You know all of these things and more. They don\u2019t.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I wrapped my arms around her shoulders, allowing her to wrap hers around my waist and pull me close to her, so our bodies were practically touching. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she said quietly, her hazel eyes meeting mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>My heart was beating faster than usual. \u201cI love you, too. And you\u2019re forgiven.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She smiled, her eyes squinting adorably, before leaning forward to close the gap between us. Her lips moved in perfect rhythm with mine and I felt her grasp on my waist tighten as she pulled us as close as possible. Any chill in the air that I felt was no longer there, and when I smiled, unfortunately breaking the kiss, I realised she was glowing golden and warming me up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI will never get used to that,\u201d I said, letting out a small laugh as I saw her whole self lighting up in the dark. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWhat can I say? You have that effect on me,\u201d she said knowingly, a smug smile on her lips. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I laughed and shook my head at how cringey she was. She grinned and pressed a kiss to my forehead before pulling me close again, the two of us hugging and looking out over the balcony. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I loved her so much.</p>",

I was covering the story for the local paper \u2013 Captain Marvel paying a visit to the children\u2019s hospital. It was sweet and I was happy to do it. Seeing the joy on the kids\u2019 faces as they met their favourite superhero in person was a privilege to photograph and everybody deserved to see it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cThat necklace is beautiful,\u201d she said to one of the young girls, a grin on her lips. \u201cDid you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>The young girl nodded as she stared in wonder at Carol, who was kneeling down to be the same height as her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cDana, sweetie, do you want to give Captain Marvel something?\u201d a nurse said kindly, smiling down at the young girl. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana nodded enthusiastically, reaching into her pocket and pulling out some bracelets. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI made these for you,\u201d she said adorably, and I snapped a photo as she held out her hand to Carol, who was watching her with adoration. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cFor me? Oh my!\u201d Carol accepted the two bracelets and studied them carefully. \u201cHow lucky am I, Dana? These are gorgeous!\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana grinned, showing her missing teeth, and I felt my heart swell at how cute she was. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou could keep one and give the other,\u201d she said, pausing to take a breath, \u201cgive the other to someone else.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cReally?

I forgot about my camera for a moment, as I watched Carol put one bracelet on her wrist and hold the other. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWell, I guess that means I have to give this to someone I love!\u201d she said, eyebrows raised with excitement, making Dana laugh. \u201cIs that okay with you?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Dana nodded eagerly, causing Carol to laugh all over again. Dana joined in and I felt my heart warming at the sight. My eyes automatically drew to Carol as she stared at Dana lovingly, a grin on her face. She glanced my way, as if to say 'look how cute she is!\u2019, before looking back to Dana. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I was too distracted by Carol, though. She was absolutely amazing and I was insanely lucky to have her as my girlfriend. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>And maybe, I guess, I had fallen in love with her. </p><p><b>when you both tell each other 'I love you\u2019\u2026</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHow is it going with the editing?\u201d Carol asked from the kitchen. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I looked up and saw her at her stove, cooking away. She had invited me over, wanting to cook me dinner at her place, and here I was, doing work. I shut my laptop and went over to her, feeling guilty for not giving her the attention she deserved. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cIt\u2019s done for the night,\u201d I mumbled, wrapping my arms around her waist and leaning my head on her shoulder. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, you\u2019ve got deadlines, I get that,\u201d she said reassuringly, glancing at me with a smile, before paying attention to the wok in front of her. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re here, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled, feeling those familiar butterflies in my stomach as she finished stirring the sauce to some pasta dish she was putting together. She turned off the gas and set the spoon down before turning around and wrapping her arms around my waist. I laced mine around her shoulder, grinning up at her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cDinner is ready,\u201d she muttered, mirroring my grin as she looked down at me. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I almost didn\u2019t register what she said because as clich\u00e9 as it sounded, I was too distracted by her golden-brown eyes, staring into mine with love and adoration. I hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about what I had heard her say that night not long ago when she thought I was asleep. She loved me, but she hadn\u2019t said it yet. She moved slow, and I was sure it was because of me. So, I took the first step. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said honestly. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She raised her eyebrows a little, but her smile didn\u2019t waiver. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded, the butterflies in my stomach flying higher and higher. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She nodded, swallowing visibly. \u201cThat\u2019s good because I love you, too.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled and she leaned forward, closing the gap between us to seal the deal with a kiss. A wonderful, beautiful, amazing, <i>loving </i>kiss. </p><p><b>when she comforts you\u2026</b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI hate everything,\u201d I mumbled into my couch cushion. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cExcept chocolate,\u201d Carol pointed out, approaching me on the couch before kneeling before me, a smile on her lips. She held out a chocolate bar. \u201cYou love chocolate.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Even if I felt like I was dying, my period killing me as each second passed, nothing could stop me from smiling at how thoughtful Carol was. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I accepted the chocolate bar, already taking the wrapper off. \u201cI love you so much, you absolute babe.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She laughed and took a seat at the end of the couch, lifting my feet before setting them on her lap. I finished the chocolate bar before pulling the blanket over my shoulders, trying to concentrate on the TV. But my cramps were hurting too much. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI want to die,\u201d I groaned over-dramatically, pulling my hot water bottle out from under my blanket and turning so I was facing the ceiling instead of the TV. I tossed the hot water bottle across the room with annoyance, mumbling, \u201cPointless piece of shit.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cBabe, do you\u2013\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said sharply, sighing with annoyance.

I noticed her hands were glowing, something they did when she was angry or frustrated, so I rested a hand on her forearm and pulled her close. I watched as the light faded and she leaned into me, her head in my shoulder. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cC'mon, let\u2019s go sit down,\u201d I said quietly into her ear, pressing a kiss to her neck before leading her to the couch. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I turned the TV off as she laid down, her head on my lap and facing the TV.

My heart broke as I watched her hurting, but she finally spoke, which made me hold off from doing anything further. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m having a shitty day and nothing is going right,\u201d she spoke quietly, clutching my hand tighter, pulling it close to her chest. \u201cMy mind keeps going to places I don\u2019t want it to and I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I continued to stoke her hair, knowing she liked the comforting feeling, and said, \u201cEverybody has those days where nothing goes right. It sucks, but without them, we can\u2019t appreciate the good days. It\u2019s horrible, but we can\u2019t get rid of them.

Don\u2019t think about anything else but now.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I felt her nod into my chest and I sighed quietly, feeling guilty that I couldn\u2019t think to do anything else. I couldn\u2019t imagine what she\u2019d been through and how it had affected her. She was always so strong, but even superheroes had their moments of vulnerability. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI wish I could take your pain away somehow.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol cuddled closer to me, if that was even possible, and said, \u201cI like it when you hold me.

I gasped as she tried to cut off my breathing, but I remembered what she taught me and elbowed her in the stomach before trying to step aside. She tightened her grip, making me step on her foot and elbow her again, harder. She shoved me off and I turned around, only to be charged at and thrown to the floor \u2013 thankfully there were mats otherwise that definitely would have hurt more than it did. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou need to regain control otherwise your attacker could come and do, well, that,\u201d Fatima explained, hands on her knees as she caught her breath. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cGotcha,\u201d I said, giving her a thumbs up, all whilst groaning and clutching my back. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna leave a bruise\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, I can go easier on you,\u201d Fatima said, helping me to stand up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shook my head immediately. \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t.

I even let out a little chuckle. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked, furrowing her brows. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shook my head distastefully. \u201cHow much of an arsehole would I be if I told you not to go?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She stepped forward, but I stepped back. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou said I could tell you not to go, but we both know that\u2019s not true at all,\u201d I said harshly, glaring at her as my sight grew blurry with tears. \u201cThat\u2019s selfish of me. To deny some poor planet out there of your help. You can save them. Why would I stop you from going? Because I miss you? How pathetic of me.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d she said instantly, grabbing my hand and squeezing it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI know it isn\u2019t, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d I said, yanking my hand away. \u201cForget it.

Well, I guess I\u2019ll see you in three weeks, Carol.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, please don\u2019t be like this,\u201d she tried to say, frowning, but I ignored her as I turned around and left our bedroom, heading to the kitchen to cool off. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I hated that I could never ask her to stay. I wished she would, but she couldn\u2019t.

I glanced up through my eyelashes, seeing Carol sat on the couch, engrossed in the television. I narrowed my eyes with annoyance before looking back to my burger, putting some lettuce and onions on it. I headed to the fridge to grab the jar of pickles and set it on the counter, attempting to open it. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I groaned as I twisted with all my might, but the stupid lid wouldn\u2019t budge. It was a brand new jar and I had no upper body strength whatsoever which made me sigh. I <i>really </i>wanted pickles, they were my favourite. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sucked up a deep breath and tried again, only to no avail.

No way in hell was I going to ask Carol for help. Not after we\u2019d just had a stupid argument about how she never emptied the dishwasher. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I used a knife to try and hit it against the lid, before attempting to open it again, but of course, nothing. I breathed out with annoyance and gave up, finishing adding sauce to my burger before taking a bite out of it. It was tasty, but damn, I really wanted pickles. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I rolled my eyes before setting down my burger and grabbing the jar. I headed to Carol, who paid no attention to me until I cleared my throat loudly. She glanced at me, paused the TV, and gave me an expressionless stare. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked bitterly. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes in front of her as I said, \u201cI can\u2019t open the pickle jar.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She suppressed a smirk as she raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh, so you want my help?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I glared at her. \u201cAre you going to open it or not?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She smiled smugly, shaking her head. \u201cI think I\u2019m alright, but thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed and rolled my eyes before turning around, pissed at how childish she was acting. I set the jar back on the counter and frowned, really wanting the damn pickles. Before I could brainstorm another way to open the jar, I heard a knock on the flat door. I glanced at Carol, seeing she was invested in the TV again, so I decided to answer the door. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>When I opened it, I almost closed it again. It was our neighbour, Cole, who had a helpless crush on me and would nonstop flirt with me, even in front of Carol, who he knew was my girlfriend. I tried my best to avoid him, but there was only so much I could do when he lived next to us. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCole, what can I do for you?\u201d I asked, forcing a smile his way. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He smirked, eyes checking me out, causing me to grip the door handle out of annoyance. \u201cY/N, you look as gorgeous as ever.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed. \u201cDo you need something?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He nodded and held out some letters. \u201cYour mail got delivered to me by accident. I thought I\u2019d return it like the amazing neighbour I am.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I accepted the mail, setting it on the table by the door. \u201cGee, thanks, Cole.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cAnything for a pretty lady like yourself,\u201d he said flirtatiously, smiling cockily. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Usually I would have slammed the door in his face by now, but I stood up straight, smiling for real. \u201cAnything, you say?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He chuckled, though was confused. \u201cI guess, why?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCan you open my pickle jar?\u201d I blurted out. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>His eyes widened, before his cocky smile returned. \u201cI-\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cIt\u2019s a literal pickle jar,\u201d I told him, giving him a knowing look, \u201cbefore you get any ideas.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He grinned. \u201cA damsel in distress? Of course I will help you, Y/N.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He followed me to the kitchen, going on about how he was happy to be my knight in shining armour. I nodded along like I was listening, but really I was thinking about the pickles I was finally going to be able to eat. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, passing him the jar. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He opened it without a struggle before handing it back to me. I smiled to myself, setting the jar on the counter. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, giving him an appreciative smile. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cAnytime, lovely lady,\u201d he said obnoxiously, sliding closer to me, forcing me to step back uncomfortably. \u201cSay\u2026 why are Carol\u2019s eyes glowing like that?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I followed his gaze and saw Carol still sat on the couch, but now she was looking our way, her eyes glowing golden. I shook my head and rolled my eyes, knowing she was jealous. As fun as it was to piss her off, I really didn\u2019t want to have to deal with her photon blasting Cole through the wall. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCole, thanks for your help once again,\u201d I said, pushing him towards the door. \u201cAnd thanks for the mail.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>He was intrigued by Carol\u2019s eyes, but eventually got the hint when I shoved him into the hallway. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I guess I\u2019ll see you around?\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I forced a smile. \u201cMaybe. Bye.\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I shut the door before he could say anything else and sighed before heading back to the kitchen, looking forward to eating my burger finally. Only, when I got there, I saw Carol stood by the counter, a hand resting on the jar and glowing, heating it up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cCarol!\u201d I shouted, shoving her away from it, before trying to grab the jar, only to yank my hand away with annoyance because it was still steaming hot. I frowned, looking into the jar to see all of the pickles gooey and gross. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cNo pickles,\u201d she said, and I looked up to see her shrugging, unbothered. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I glared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a child! If you had just opened the jar <i>for </i>me, I wouldn\u2019t have had to ask Cole! You\u2019re a jealous, annoying freakin\u2019 child, ugh!\u201d I looked back to my pickles, frowning again. \u201cI finally got the jar open, damn\u2026\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I heard Carol groan and was about to fight her about it, but I saw her heading to the door. I followed her, watching as she put on her leather jacket and grabbed her car keys. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d I asked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cFirst you ruin my burger and now you\u2019re just gonna leave?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy you some damn pickles,\u201d she got out through gritted teeth, a little guiltily, before leaving the flat, slamming the door behind her. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I stood there for a moment, arms crossed as I stared at the door, only to hate myself for smiling and not feeling so mad anymore. \u00a0</p><p><b>when you get jealous\u2026 </b></p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I sighed, staring at the bannister and wondering why I was here. I wasn\u2019t one for parties and\u2013 actually? Scratch that. I wasn\u2019t one for parties where the freakin\u2019 Avengers attended. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol and I were at a party being hosted by the one and only Tony Stark and it should have been a dream come true, except it was the seventh party I\u2019d been to and the same thing happened every time. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol was amazing and I loved her, but she was oblivious to the fact that she\u2019d leave me out and I would feel out of place. She loved the Avengers and would always hang out with them, leaving me to attempt to mingle with people I didn\u2019t know. So, I always found myself hiding in this same spot for most of the time \u2013 the staircase. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I was deciding what I could possibly do to pass time when the door opened, startling me and making me sit up straight on the steps. It was Natasha Romanoff. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I felt my cheeks grow warm as I said, \u201cErm, sorry, I can go if\u2013\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She shook her head, smiling softly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, sorry to disturb.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I didn\u2019t know what to say, so she closed the door, stepping inside, and the music from the party went back to being muffled in the distance. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou okay over here?\u201d she asked, a hint of concern in her voice. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded unconvincingly. \u201cErm, yeah. Shouldn\u2019t you be enjoying the party?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She snickered, taking a seat a few steps below me. She leaned back against the bannister, glancing up at me with a raised eyebrow. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I cracked a small smile. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She sighed, her smile fading. \u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong? Are you and Carol fighting or something?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She shrugged. \u201cYou guys haven\u2019t exactly been close this evening. And you\u2019re sat in here alone when she\u2019s out there having fun.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I looked down at my hands in my lap, avoiding Nat\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re fine\u2026\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I met her amused expression. \u201cIt\u2019s silly.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>A hint of a smile was on her lips as she said, \u201cMost of my life is serious, so enlighten me with this silliness of yours.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I mirrored her expression before looking ahead of me. \u201cIt\u2019s just, whenever we get invited to a party with you guys, I feel like Carol prefers hanging out with all of you instead of me. She just seems more interested in you guys and I mean, I get it. You\u2019re the Avengers. But I don\u2019t know, I feel stupid for getting jealous. You all know her better than I do and that\u2019s why I feel left out. Like I\u2019m second place or something.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I looked to Natasha and saw her giving me a knowing look. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cOkay, that totally wasn\u2019t silly, so I\u2019m slightly annoyed you got my hopes up,\u201d she began, making me chuckle, \u201cand Carol adores you, Y/N. You could never come in second place to any of us.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I frowned, glancing down at my hands again. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHave you told her how you feel?\u201d she asked gently. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled sadly. \u201cI could never do that. I don\u2019t want to be <i>that</i> girlfriend, you know? The jealous one who makes her girl feel bad for hanging out with her friends. I don\u2019t want to start an argument or anything. Besides, Carol doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, so I\u2019ll go back to the party later or something. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Natasha nodded. \u201cI get you, but you should try talking to her, Y/N. She loves you a lot and I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t mean to make you feel like this.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI know she doesn\u2019t,\u201d I agreed, before breathing out slowly. \u201cMaybe another time, Nat. For now, I think I\u2019ll stay here. Unless you wanna kick me out.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Nat laughed, beginning to stand up. \u201cThe staircase is all yours, Y/N. I just wanted to check in on you.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled up at her as she approached the door. \u201cThank you. And erm, please can you not mention any of this to Carol? I don\u2019t wanna freak her out.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Natasha smiled. \u201cI promise not to say anything.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I nodded gratefully and watched her leave. I stayed sat on the staircase for another twenty minutes or so, just thinking. At first, I thought I should have made more of on effort instead of hiding, but then I was reminded of all the times before now when I had done that, and I\u2019d just ended up miserable. I hated that I felt second best to literal superheroes. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I finally returned to the party after sulking for a while, seeing the penthouse was pretty much the same save for the few extra smashed vases, probably from drunken dares. I saw the Avengers dotted around, all of them enjoying themselves to the fullest. Though I couldn\u2019t see Carol anywhere. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N, there you are!\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Speak of the devil. I turned around and saw Carol approaching me, a concerned expression on her face. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cHere I am,\u201d I said, smiling half-heartedly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She grabbed my hand, squeezing it gently. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you. I was hoping we could talk.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I saw the seriousness in her eyes and nodded, wondering what she wanted. I allowed her to lead me outside on the balcony. There was nobody out there which was probably why she took me there, and I found us both standing by the edge, leaning on the gate and looking out into the city. Tony Stark was one lucky man to be able to afford to see this view every day. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>It was a little chilly though, and Carol must have noticed because she shrugged off her jacket and gave it to me. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cYou sure?\u201d I asked, reluctantly accepting the jacket. </p><p><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201c</b>Super powers, remember?\u201c she reminded me, raising a glowing hand. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I smiled before putting her jacket on, instantly in a trance because of her smell hugging me close. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\"What did you need?\u201d I asked, remembering why we were out here. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She frowned, holding both of my hands now. \u201cY/N, I\u2019m so sorry. Nat told me about what you said earlier.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I closed my eyes, sighing. \u201cGod damn, Nat\u2026 it\u2019s literally in her job description to keep secrets and she can\u2019t keep this one thing to herself\u2026\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cY/N\u2013\u201d</p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter what I said,\u201d I said, opening my eyes and looking into Carol\u2019s. \u201cNat caught me at a bad time. I was just venting. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol shook her head, lifting her hand to rest against my cheek. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not acceptable. I didn\u2019t realise I was neglecting you. I just get so excited around the others and I never meant to leave you out. I don\u2019t want you to feel bad.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I rested my hand on hers, pulling it from my face and kissing it gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Carol. Jealousy is an ugly colour on everyone. Especially me.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>Carol sighed quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You mean the world to me, Y/N. You\u2019re always first place in my mind. It\u2019s not even a competition. You\u2019d win every time.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I cracked a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI love you because you get me,\u201d she continued, her eyes glistening with honesty. \u201cYou get me more than the Avengers. Yeah, they\u2019re pretty cool, but you\u2019re the one who knows me best. You know I like my blankets put in the dryer to warm them up before bed, or that I like to wear my Goose-themed slippers around the flat. Or that I like to be held when I\u2019ve had a rough day. You know all of these things and more. They don\u2019t.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I wrapped my arms around her shoulders, allowing her to wrap hers around my waist and pull me close to her, so our bodies were practically touching. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she said quietly, her hazel eyes meeting mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>My heart was beating faster than usual. \u201cI love you, too. And you\u2019re forgiven.\u201d </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>She smiled, her eyes squinting adorably, before leaning forward to close the gap between us. Her lips moved in perfect rhythm with mine and I felt her grasp on my waist tighten as she pulled us as close as possible. Any chill in the air that I felt was no longer there, and when I smiled, unfortunately breaking the kiss, I realised she was glowing golden and warming me up. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cI will never get used to that,\u201d I said, letting out a small laugh as I saw her whole self lighting up in the dark. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>\u201cWhat can I say? You have that effect on me,\u201d she said knowingly, a smug smile on her lips. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I laughed and shook my head at how cringey she was. She grinned and pressed a kiss to my forehead before pulling me close again, the two of us hugging and looking out over the balcony. </p><p><b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</b>I loved her so much.</p>",

I&rsquo;ll stay forever, if you&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I felt her lips press to my forehead before she tucked her head into my shoulder. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;God, Carol, you&rsquo;re such a nerd,&rdquo; she mumbled to herself, and I truly had to resist the urge to smile. </p><p><i><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She loves me. </i></p><p><b>when you realise you love her&hellip;</b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I continued to take photos of Carol, or &lsquo;Captain Marvel&rsquo; I guess, as she met with the sick children at the children&rsquo;s hospital. I was covering the story for the local paper &ndash; Captain Marvel paying a visit to the children&rsquo;s hospital. It was sweet and I was happy to do it. Seeing the joy on the kids&rsquo; faces as they met their favourite superhero in person was a privilege to photograph and everybody deserved to see it. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;That necklace is beautiful,&rdquo; she said to one of the young girls, a grin on her lips. &ldquo;Did you make it yourself?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>The young girl nodded as she stared in wonder at Carol, who was kneeling down to be the same height as her. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Dana, sweetie, do you want to give Captain Marvel something?&rdquo; a nurse said kindly, smiling down at the young girl. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Dana nodded enthusiastically, reaching into her pocket and pulling out some bracelets. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I made these for you,&rdquo; she said adorably, and I snapped a photo as she held out her hand to Carol, who was watching her with adoration. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;For me? Oh my!&rdquo; Carol accepted the two bracelets and studied them carefully. &ldquo;How lucky am I, Dana? These are gorgeous!&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Dana grinned, showing her missing teeth, and I felt my heart swell at how cute she was. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You could keep one and give the other,&rdquo; she said, pausing to take a breath, &ldquo;give the other to someone else.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Really? And who do you think I should give it to?&rdquo; Carol asked her, a beautiful smile on her face as she looked to Dana. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Whoever you want!&rdquo; Dana said, shrugging. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Well, why did you give it to me?&rdquo; Carol asked her, holding Dana&rsquo;s hand gently. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Dana grinned. &ldquo;Because I love you!&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol laughed and the nurse watched with amusement. I forgot about my camera for a moment, as I watched Carol put one bracelet on her wrist and hold the other. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Well, I guess that means I have to give this to someone I love!&rdquo; she said, eyebrows raised with excitement, making Dana laugh. &ldquo;Is that okay with you?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Dana nodded eagerly, causing Carol to laugh all over again. Dana joined in and I felt my heart warming at the sight. My eyes automatically drew to Carol as she stared at Dana lovingly, a grin on her face. She glanced my way, as if to say 'look how cute she is!&rsquo;, before looking back to Dana. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I was too distracted by Carol, though. She was absolutely amazing and I was insanely lucky to have her as my girlfriend. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>And maybe, I guess, I had fallen in love with her. </p><p><b>when you both tell each other 'I love you&rsquo;&hellip;</b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;How is it going with the editing?&rdquo; Carol asked from the kitchen. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I looked up and saw her at her stove, cooking away. She had invited me over, wanting to cook me dinner at her place, and here I was, doing work. I shut my laptop and went over to her, feeling guilty for not giving her the attention she deserved. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done for the night,&rdquo; I mumbled, wrapping my arms around her waist and leaning my head on her shoulder. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;ve got deadlines, I get that,&rdquo; she said reassuringly, glancing at me with a smile, before paying attention to the wok in front of her. &ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re here, I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I smiled, feeling those familiar butterflies in my stomach as she finished stirring the sauce to some pasta dish she was putting together. She turned off the gas and set the spoon down before turning around and wrapping her arms around my waist. I laced mine around her shoulder, grinning up at her. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Dinner is ready,&rdquo; she muttered, mirroring my grin as she looked down at me. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I almost didn&rsquo;t register what she said because as clich&eacute; as it sounded, I was too distracted by her golden-brown eyes, staring into mine with love and adoration. I hadn&rsquo;t stopped thinking about what I had heard her say that night not long ago when she thought I was asleep. She loved me, but she hadn&rsquo;t said it yet. She moved slow, and I was sure it was because of me. So, I took the first step. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I said honestly. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She raised her eyebrows a little, but her smile didn&rsquo;t waiver. &ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I nodded, the butterflies in my stomach flying higher and higher. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She nodded, swallowing visibly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good because I love you, too.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I smiled and she leaned forward, closing the gap between us to seal the deal with a kiss. A wonderful, beautiful, amazing, <i>loving </i>kiss. </p><p><b>when she comforts you&hellip;</b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I hate everything,&rdquo; I mumbled into my couch cushion. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Except chocolate,&rdquo; Carol pointed out, approaching me on the couch before kneeling before me, a smile on her lips. She held out a chocolate bar. &ldquo;You love chocolate.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Even if I felt like I was dying, my period killing me as each second passed, nothing could stop me from smiling at how thoughtful Carol was. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I accepted the chocolate bar, already taking the wrapper off. &ldquo;I love you so much, you absolute babe.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She laughed and took a seat at the end of the couch, lifting my feet before setting them on her lap. I finished the chocolate bar before pulling the blanket over my shoulders, trying to concentrate on the TV. But my cramps were hurting too much. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I want to die,&rdquo; I groaned over-dramatically, pulling my hot water bottle out from under my blanket and turning so I was facing the ceiling instead of the TV. I tossed the hot water bottle across the room with annoyance, mumbling, &ldquo;Pointless piece of shit.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Babe, do you&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I said sharply, sighing with annoyance. Another cramp struck though and I pulled a face. &ldquo;Damn. I need the hot water bottle back.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;How about something better?&rdquo; Carol said, already moving to squeeze by my side on the couch. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She got under the blanket with me and rested a hand on my abdomen gently. I felt her hand heating up slowly, eventually staying at the perfect temperature and soothing the cramps that were once taking over. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Oh my god&hellip;,&rdquo; I said, closing my eyes in relief. &ldquo;That feels so good.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I heard Carol chuckle from beside me and I opened my eyes to turn to her. She was smiling, her eyes never leaving mine. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Sorry for being a bitch,&rdquo; I said, resting my hand on hers. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol suppressed a laugh, kissing the tip of my nose. &ldquo;I know, Y/N. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so much better than a hot water bottle,&rdquo; I said, leaning my head on her shoulder and closing my eyes again, not feeling so uptight now that my ovaries weren&rsquo;t exploding. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; she said, and I could sense the amusement in her voice.</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I smiled to myself, grateful that my photon-blasting, plane-flying, planet-saving girlfriend had some warm, loving hands to make me feel better. </p><p><b>when you comfort her&hellip;</b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I was watching TV when I heard the sound of metal scratching against tile from the kitchen. I looked away from the screen and saw Carol cursing to herself as she bent down to the floor, only to stand up, holding a spoon. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Stupid spoon,&rdquo; she mumbled, throwing it into the sink with a loud <i>clang</i>. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I noticed how annoyed she looked as she put the yoghurt she got out back into the fridge, probably changing her mind on eating it, but when she opened the fridge, an orange juice carton fell out onto the floor. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she yelled, aggressively picking the carton from the floor and shoving it into the fridge with anger. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; I said softly, standing up and going to her. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s just juice. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She slammed the fridge shut, making it tremble under her strength, before breathing out slowly. I noticed her hands were glowing, something they did when she was angry or frustrated, so I rested a hand on her forearm and pulled her close. I watched as the light faded and she leaned into me, her head in my shoulder. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;C'mon, let&rsquo;s go sit down,&rdquo; I said quietly into her ear, pressing a kiss to her neck before leading her to the couch. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I turned the TV off as she laid down, her head on my lap and facing the TV. I pulled the blanket on top of her, wrapping her up, before holding one of her hands and running my other hand through her hair. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You wanna tell me what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; I asked gently, not wanting to push her into speaking. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She didn&rsquo;t say anything at first, so I assumed she wasn&rsquo;t in the mood, but then I saw her sniffle and realised tears were running down her cheeks. My heart broke as I watched her hurting, but she finally spoke, which made me hold off from doing anything further. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a shitty day and nothing is going right,&rdquo; she spoke quietly, clutching my hand tighter, pulling it close to her chest. &ldquo;My mind keeps going to places I don&rsquo;t want it to and I don&rsquo;t know what to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I continued to stoke her hair, knowing she liked the comforting feeling, and said, &ldquo;Everybody has those days where nothing goes right. It sucks, but without them, we can&rsquo;t appreciate the good days. It&rsquo;s horrible, but we can&rsquo;t get rid of them. We can try to make them better though.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She sighed, using her other hand to wipe her tears before turning around in my lap, so she was looking up at me. I smiled down at her reassuringly and she forced a small smile in return. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;The Kree soldiers almost got away with it,&rdquo; she suddenly said, her smile disappearing. I saw an absent look in her eyes as she continued. &ldquo;They almost convinced me that I was one of them. I know it was a long time ago, but I can&rsquo;t help but think&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Think what, Carol?&rdquo; I asked, holding her gaze. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She blinked and her glassy eyes released another tear. &ldquo;What if they got away with it? Successfully made me forget about my life here? I could still be killing innocents right now if I didn&rsquo;t realise the truth.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She sat up before I could say anything and I watched as she leaned into her hands, taking a deep breath. I frowned, rubbing her back slowly as she tried to get herself together. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re having an off day and that can put your thoughts in some bad places,&rdquo; I told her, pressing a kiss to her shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking about the what if&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s not helping. You&rsquo;re just overthinking.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she mumbled, crawling back onto my lap, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I wrapped my arms around her as she tucked her head into my neck, sniffling slightly. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard, but try focusing on the present,&rdquo; I said gently. &ldquo;Think about what you have. What&rsquo;s right in front of you. Don&rsquo;t think about anything else but now.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I felt her nod into my chest and I sighed quietly, feeling guilty that I couldn&rsquo;t think to do anything else. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what she&rsquo;d been through and how it had affected her. She was always so strong, but even superheroes had their moments of vulnerability. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;I wish I could take your pain away somehow.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol cuddled closer to me, if that was even possible, and said, &ldquo;I like it when you hold me. I feel safe.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I cracked a smile, glancing down at her. She had her eyes closed contently, a ghost of a smile on her lips. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; I said, pressing a kiss to her head. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Not more than I love you,&rdquo; she replied quietly, and my smile widened. </p><p><b>when she&rsquo;s mad at you&hellip;</b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I nodded, raising my hands in defence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>My self defence instructor, Fatima, took a deep breath before coming forward, grabbing me in a headlock. I gasped as she tried to cut off my breathing, but I remembered what she taught me and elbowed her in the stomach before trying to step aside. She tightened her grip, making me step on her foot and elbow her again, harder. She shoved me off and I turned around, only to be charged at and thrown to the floor &ndash; thankfully there were mats otherwise that definitely would have hurt more than it did. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You need to regain control otherwise your attacker could come and do, well, that,&rdquo; Fatima explained, hands on her knees as she caught her breath. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Gotcha,&rdquo; I said, giving her a thumbs up, all whilst groaning and clutching my back. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s gonna leave a bruise&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N, I can go easier on you,&rdquo; Fatima said, helping me to stand up. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I shook my head immediately. &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t. If I was actually getting attacked, they wouldn&rsquo;t take it easy on me.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Fatima nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I said, ignoring the existent-bruises on my body and getting into a fighting stance. &ldquo;Again.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I was laying on the couch, watching TV and resting my body from training when I heard the front door opening. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re in the exact same place I left you in,&rdquo; Carol commented when she walked in, an amused smile on her lips. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I chuckled, muting the TV as she dropped her coat by the door before running towards me and laying on top of me. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; I whined, though I secretly loved it. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She laughed and placed her hands by my head to balance herself above me. She grinned down at me, her hair falling by her face and framing her beautiful smile. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I missed you today,&rdquo; she said, her eyes meeting mine. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I mirrored her smile, tucking some of her hair behind her ear. &ldquo;I missed you, too. How was work?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about that. I just want to be with you.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>My heart warmed as she leaned forward and pressed her lips to mine, sending a surge of butterflies in my stomach. I was exhausted and sore, wanting to push her off, but I missed her too much and found myself kissing her back, my hand on the nape of her neck as she pressed her body to mine. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She sucked on my lower lip which elicited a moan from me, making her smirk beneath me before she moved down to my neck and started to suck on the sensitive skin. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; I moaned, my eyes rolling backwards in satisfaction. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Maybe we should take this elsewhere,&rdquo; she mumbled, working her way back up my neck and to my lips. She disconnected our lips so she could place her hands around my waist to lift me up, but I groaned loudly when her hands gripped one of my bruises. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Oh my god, Y/N, I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; she said quickly, her eyes widening as she pulled away, rolling off me to stand up. &ldquo;Did I hurt you?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I breathed out and sat up, pulling a face at how quickly my limbs went stiff from not moving. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Carol, it wasn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; I assured her, seeing the guilt in her expression. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She kneeled down in front of me, shaking her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t think I held you that strong, oh my god. Here, let me check.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She reached to my shirt to pull it up and I tried to stop her, but she&rsquo;d already done it and her eyes widened even more, if possible. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Oh my god! Did I do that?!&rdquo; she asked, her hand wavering over her mouth in shock. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Carol, no, of course not!&rdquo; I said, grabbing her hands and squeezing them gently. I got her attention by catching her eyes and said, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t you, I promise.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Who&ndash; who did that to you?!&rdquo; she asked, sitting beside me, her eyes now on my bruised hip, though it was covered by my shirt. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Carol, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I tried to reassure her, but I knew this wouldn&rsquo;t end well. She didn&rsquo;t know about my self-defence training, and for very good reason. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N, who hurt you?&rdquo; she said through gritted teeth, her eyes tearing up. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath, before opening them again and saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault. I&hellip; I sometimes get hurt when I go to my self-defence classes.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She blinked several times, finally meeting my eyes. &ldquo;Your&hellip; your <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I kept ahold of her hands as I said, &ldquo;I take self-defence classes, Carol. Well, personal training, I guess. My instructor, Fatima, teaches me basic self-defence moves and I guess sometimes I take it a little too far and sustain some bruising, but nothing serious.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Nothing serious? Your hip is purple, Y/N!&rdquo; Carol shouted, letting go of my hands. &ldquo;Why the hell do you need to go to self-defence?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Carol, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal,&rdquo; I said, keeping my voice at its normal volume. &ldquo;I just want to be able to protect myself.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I thought I&hellip; I try to protect the both of us, Y/N,&rdquo; Carol said, her voice lowering. &ldquo;Do I not do a good enough job?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; I said, resting a hand on her knee. &ldquo;You keep me safe, Carol, but you&rsquo;re not always around. I want to be able to defend myself if you&rsquo;re not there.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol bit her lip, shaking her head as she looked away from me. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you hid this from me&hellip; When exactly am I not here, Y/N? I try my hardest!&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I clenched my jaw, feeling my own eyes tearing up now. &ldquo;Carol, this isn&rsquo;t about you. I know you do the best you can. But you&rsquo;re not my personal bodyguard.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;What are you scared of?!&rdquo; she asked, meeting my eyes desperately. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Your enemies! Okay?! I&rsquo;m scared of your enemies!&rdquo; I yelled, a tear escaping my eye. &ldquo;Have you forgotten when that HYDRA agent broke into our flat and tried to kill me five months ago?!&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol&rsquo;s angry expression faded as she saw me being deadly serious. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t there, Carol! And I&rsquo;m not blaming you! But if I had known, even a <i>little </i>bit of knowledge on how to protect myself, maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t have almost died! I was terrified, okay?! I don&rsquo;t want to feel like that again!&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol watched as I regained control of my breathing and I didn&rsquo;t know what else to say. I wiped away any stray tears of mine and stood up, wincing a little at my sore body. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t up to you,&rdquo; I said, angrily. &ldquo;This is <i>my </i>choice. You don&rsquo;t <i>get </i>to be angry.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I didn&rsquo;t spare her a glance as I left the living-room and headed straight to our bedroom, making sure to slam the door behind me so she knew not to follow me. I sighed as I crawled into our bed, staring at the ceiling. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She didn&rsquo;t get to tell me what to do this time. She wouldn&rsquo;t understand. She&rsquo;s this omnipotent being with the ability to hurt anyone who tried to hurt her. She didn&rsquo;t understand what it was like to be vulnerable. She didn&rsquo;t get to tell me what to do. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>This was <i>my </i>choice. </p><p><b>when you&rsquo;re mad at her&hellip;</b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just three weeks and I&rsquo;ll be back before you know it,&rdquo; Carol tried to sound hopeful, but I couldn&rsquo;t even look at her without feeling the urge to yell. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She was leaving for yet another mission assigned by S.H.I.E.L.D. - by Nick Fury himself. She had only just come back from a mission a week ago and was already preparing to leave for another. I knew it came with the job. She was a superhero, she saved people, made them feel safe. But it wasn&rsquo;t fair. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I knew she would have to leave at times, I understood why. But it didn&rsquo;t make it any easier. At first, I could say goodbye and see her again without feeling anything other than longing. I missed her, but she always came back. Now, I only ever felt angry and I hated it. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; she called, her voice soft and careful as she stepped closer to me. &ldquo;Is that okay?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I breathed out slowly before looking to her. &ldquo;When have you ever needed my permission?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She seemed taken aback as she held my stare with uncertainty. &ldquo;If you tell me not to go, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I searched her eyes for something, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure what. I just knew that the longer I stared at the golden flecks swirling around, the more I found this whole thing funny. I even let out a little chuckle. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; she asked, furrowing her brows. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I shook my head distastefully. &ldquo;How much of an arsehole would I be if I told you not to go?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She stepped forward, but I stepped back. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You said I could tell you not to go, but we both know that&rsquo;s not true at all,&rdquo; I said harshly, glaring at her as my sight grew blurry with tears. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s selfish of me. To deny some poor planet out there of your help. You can save them. Why would I stop you from going? Because I miss you? How pathetic of me.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N, that&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; she said instantly, grabbing my hand and squeezing it. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s how it is,&rdquo; I said, yanking my hand away. &ldquo;Forget it. Three weeks, right? Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll see you in three weeks, Carol.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N, please don&rsquo;t be like this,&rdquo; she tried to say, frowning, but I ignored her as I turned around and left our bedroom, heading to the kitchen to cool off. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I hated that I could never ask her to stay. I wished she would, but she couldn&rsquo;t. And there was nothing I could do about it. &nbsp;</p><p><b>when you&rsquo;re in an argument + when she gets jealous&hellip;</b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I pursed my lips as I assembled my burger. I glanced up through my eyelashes, seeing Carol sat on the couch, engrossed in the television. I narrowed my eyes with annoyance before looking back to my burger, putting some lettuce and onions on it. I headed to the fridge to grab the jar of pickles and set it on the counter, attempting to open it. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I groaned as I twisted with all my might, but the stupid lid wouldn&rsquo;t budge. It was a brand new jar and I had no upper body strength whatsoever which made me sigh. I <i>really </i>wanted pickles, they were my favourite. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I sucked up a deep breath and tried again, only to no avail. I clenched my jaw, using a tea towel to try and develop a grip before attempting to open it again. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I muttered, my stubbornness getting the best of me. No way in hell was I going to ask Carol for help. Not after we&rsquo;d just had a stupid argument about how she never emptied the dishwasher. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I used a knife to try and hit it against the lid, before attempting to open it again, but of course, nothing. I breathed out with annoyance and gave up, finishing adding sauce to my burger before taking a bite out of it. It was tasty, but damn, I really wanted pickles. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I rolled my eyes before setting down my burger and grabbing the jar. I headed to Carol, who paid no attention to me until I cleared my throat loudly. She glanced at me, paused the TV, and gave me an expressionless stare. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; she asked bitterly. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes in front of her as I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t open the pickle jar.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She suppressed a smirk as she raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh, so you want my help?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I glared at her. &ldquo;Are you going to open it or not?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She smiled smugly, shaking her head. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m alright, but thanks for asking.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I sighed and rolled my eyes before turning around, pissed at how childish she was acting. I set the jar back on the counter and frowned, really wanting the damn pickles. Before I could brainstorm another way to open the jar, I heard a knock on the flat door. I glanced at Carol, seeing she was invested in the TV again, so I decided to answer the door. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>When I opened it, I almost closed it again. It was our neighbour, Cole, who had a helpless crush on me and would nonstop flirt with me, even in front of Carol, who he knew was my girlfriend. I tried my best to avoid him, but there was only so much I could do when he lived next to us. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Cole, what can I do for you?&rdquo; I asked, forcing a smile his way. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>He smirked, eyes checking me out, causing me to grip the door handle out of annoyance. &ldquo;Y/N, you look as gorgeous as ever.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I sighed. &ldquo;Do you need something?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>He nodded and held out some letters. &ldquo;Your mail got delivered to me by accident. I thought I&rsquo;d return it like the amazing neighbour I am.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I accepted the mail, setting it on the table by the door. &ldquo;Gee, thanks, Cole.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Anything for a pretty lady like yourself,&rdquo; he said flirtatiously, smiling cockily. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Usually I would have slammed the door in his face by now, but I stood up straight, smiling for real. &ldquo;Anything, you say?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>He chuckled, though was confused. &ldquo;I guess, why?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Can you open my pickle jar?&rdquo; I blurted out. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>His eyes widened, before his cocky smile returned. &ldquo;I-&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a literal pickle jar,&rdquo; I told him, giving him a knowing look, &ldquo;before you get any ideas.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>He grinned. &ldquo;A damsel in distress? Of course I will help you, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>He followed me to the kitchen, going on about how he was happy to be my knight in shining armour. I nodded along like I was listening, but really I was thinking about the pickles I was finally going to be able to eat. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I said, passing him the jar. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>He opened it without a struggle before handing it back to me. I smiled to myself, setting the jar on the counter. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said, giving him an appreciative smile. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Anytime, lovely lady,&rdquo; he said obnoxiously, sliding closer to me, forcing me to step back uncomfortably. &ldquo;Say&hellip; why are Carol&rsquo;s eyes glowing like that?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I followed his gaze and saw Carol still sat on the couch, but now she was looking our way, her eyes glowing golden. I shook my head and rolled my eyes, knowing she was jealous. As fun as it was to piss her off, I really didn&rsquo;t want to have to deal with her photon blasting Cole through the wall. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Cole, thanks for your help once again,&rdquo; I said, pushing him towards the door. &ldquo;And thanks for the mail.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>He was intrigued by Carol&rsquo;s eyes, but eventually got the hint when I shoved him into the hallway. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. I guess I&rsquo;ll see you around?&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I forced a smile. &ldquo;Maybe. Bye.&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I shut the door before he could say anything else and sighed before heading back to the kitchen, looking forward to eating my burger finally. Only, when I got there, I saw Carol stood by the counter, a hand resting on the jar and glowing, heating it up. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Carol!&rdquo; I shouted, shoving her away from it, before trying to grab the jar, only to yank my hand away with annoyance because it was still steaming hot. I frowned, looking into the jar to see all of the pickles gooey and gross. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;No pickles,&rdquo; she said, and I looked up to see her shrugging, unbothered. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I glared at her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting like a child! If you had just opened the jar <i>for </i>me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to ask Cole! You&rsquo;re a jealous, annoying freakin&rsquo; child, ugh!&rdquo; I looked back to my pickles, frowning again. &ldquo;I finally got the jar open, damn&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I heard Carol groan and was about to fight her about it, but I saw her heading to the door. I followed her, watching as she put on her leather jacket and grabbed her car keys. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Where are you going now?&rdquo; I asked, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;First you ruin my burger and now you&rsquo;re just gonna leave?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to buy you some damn pickles,&rdquo; she got out through gritted teeth, a little guiltily, before leaving the flat, slamming the door behind her. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I stood there for a moment, arms crossed as I stared at the door, only to hate myself for smiling and not feeling so mad anymore. &nbsp;</p><p><b>when you get jealous&hellip; </b></p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I sighed, staring at the bannister and wondering why I was here. I wasn&rsquo;t one for parties and&ndash; actually? Scratch that. I wasn&rsquo;t one for parties where the freakin&rsquo; Avengers attended. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol and I were at a party being hosted by the one and only Tony Stark and it should have been a dream come true, except it was the seventh party I&rsquo;d been to and the same thing happened every time. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol was amazing and I loved her, but she was oblivious to the fact that she&rsquo;d leave me out and I would feel out of place. She loved the Avengers and would always hang out with them, leaving me to attempt to mingle with people I didn&rsquo;t know. So, I always found myself hiding in this same spot for most of the time &ndash; the staircase. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I was deciding what I could possibly do to pass time when the door opened, startling me and making me sit up straight on the steps. It was Natasha Romanoff. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I felt my cheeks grow warm as I said, &ldquo;Erm, sorry, I can go if&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She shook her head, smiling softly. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine, sorry to disturb.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so she closed the door, stepping inside, and the music from the party went back to being muffled in the distance. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You okay over here?&rdquo; she asked, a hint of concern in her voice. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I nodded unconvincingly. &ldquo;Erm, yeah. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be enjoying the party?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She snickered, taking a seat a few steps below me. She leaned back against the bannister, glancing up at me with a raised eyebrow. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I cracked a small smile. &ldquo;Touch&eacute;.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She sighed, her smile fading. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s wrong? Are you and Carol fighting or something?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I furrowed my eyebrows. &ldquo;Why would you think that?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She shrugged. &ldquo;You guys haven&rsquo;t exactly been close this evening. And you&rsquo;re sat in here alone when she&rsquo;s out there having fun.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I looked down at my hands in my lap, avoiding Nat&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You sure about that?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I met her amused expression. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>A hint of a smile was on her lips as she said, &ldquo;Most of my life is serious, so enlighten me with this silliness of yours.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I mirrored her expression before looking ahead of me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, whenever we get invited to a party with you guys, I feel like Carol prefers hanging out with all of you instead of me. She just seems more interested in you guys and I mean, I get it. You&rsquo;re the Avengers. But I don&rsquo;t know, I feel stupid for getting jealous. You all know her better than I do and that&rsquo;s why I feel left out. Like I&rsquo;m second place or something.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I looked to Natasha and saw her giving me a knowing look. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Okay, that totally wasn&rsquo;t silly, so I&rsquo;m slightly annoyed you got my hopes up,&rdquo; she began, making me chuckle, &ldquo;and Carol adores you, Y/N. You could never come in second place to any of us.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I frowned, glancing down at my hands again. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Have you told her how you feel?&rdquo; she asked gently. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I smiled sadly. &ldquo;I could never do that. I don&rsquo;t want to be <i>that</i> girlfriend, you know? The jealous one who makes her girl feel bad for hanging out with her friends. I don&rsquo;t want to start an argument or anything. Besides, Carol doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m here, so I&rsquo;ll go back to the party later or something. It&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Natasha nodded. &ldquo;I get you, but you should try talking to her, Y/N. She loves you a lot and I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t mean to make you feel like this.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I know she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I agreed, before breathing out slowly. &ldquo;Maybe another time, Nat. For now, I think I&rsquo;ll stay here. Unless you wanna kick me out.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Nat laughed, beginning to stand up. &ldquo;The staircase is all yours, Y/N. I just wanted to check in on you.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I smiled up at her as she approached the door. &ldquo;Thank you. And erm, please can you not mention any of this to Carol? I don&rsquo;t wanna freak her out.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Natasha smiled. &ldquo;I promise not to say anything.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I nodded gratefully and watched her leave. I stayed sat on the staircase for another twenty minutes or so, just thinking. At first, I thought I should have made more of on effort instead of hiding, but then I was reminded of all the times before now when I had done that, and I&rsquo;d just ended up miserable. I hated that I felt second best to literal superheroes. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I finally returned to the party after sulking for a while, seeing the penthouse was pretty much the same save for the few extra smashed vases, probably from drunken dares. I saw the Avengers dotted around, all of them enjoying themselves to the fullest. Though I couldn&rsquo;t see Carol anywhere. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N, there you are!&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Speak of the devil. I turned around and saw Carol approaching me, a concerned expression on her face. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; I said, smiling half-heartedly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She grabbed my hand, squeezing it gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you. I was hoping we could talk.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I saw the seriousness in her eyes and nodded, wondering what she wanted. I allowed her to lead me outside on the balcony. There was nobody out there which was probably why she took me there, and I found us both standing by the edge, leaning on the gate and looking out into the city. Tony Stark was one lucky man to be able to afford to see this view every day. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>It was a little chilly though, and Carol must have noticed because she shrugged off her jacket and gave it to me. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; I asked, reluctantly accepting the jacket. </p><p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;</b>Super powers, remember?&ldquo; she reminded me, raising a glowing hand. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I smiled before putting her jacket on, instantly in a trance because of her smell hugging me close. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>\"What did you need?&rdquo; I asked, remembering why we were out here. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She frowned, holding both of my hands now. &ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m so sorry. Nat told me about what you said earlier.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I closed my eyes, sighing. &ldquo;God damn, Nat&hellip; it&rsquo;s literally in her job description to keep secrets and she can&rsquo;t keep this one thing to herself&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Y/N&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Look, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I said,&rdquo; I said, opening my eyes and looking into Carol&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Nat caught me at a bad time. I was just venting. I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol shook her head, lifting her hand to rest against my cheek. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not acceptable. I didn&rsquo;t realise I was neglecting you. I just get so excited around the others and I never meant to leave you out. I don&rsquo;t want you to feel bad.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I rested my hand on hers, pulling it from my face and kissing it gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Carol. Jealousy is an ugly colour on everyone. Especially me.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Carol sighed quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. You mean the world to me, Y/N. You&rsquo;re always first place in my mind. It&rsquo;s not even a competition. You&rsquo;d win every time.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I cracked a smile. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I love you because you get me,&rdquo; she continued, her eyes glistening with honesty. &ldquo;You get me more than the Avengers. Yeah, they&rsquo;re pretty cool, but you&rsquo;re the one who knows me best. You know I like my blankets put in the dryer to warm them up before bed, or that I like to wear my Goose-themed slippers around the flat. Or that I like to be held when I&rsquo;ve had a rough day. You know all of these things and more. They don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I wrapped my arms around her shoulders, allowing her to wrap hers around my waist and pull me close to her, so our bodies were practically touching. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; she said quietly, her hazel eyes meeting mine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>My heart was beating faster than usual. &ldquo;I love you, too. And you&rsquo;re forgiven.&rdquo; </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>She smiled, her eyes squinting adorably, before leaning forward to close the gap between us. Her lips moved in perfect rhythm with mine and I felt her grasp on my waist tighten as she pulled us as close as possible. Any chill in the air that I felt was no longer there, and when I smiled, unfortunately breaking the kiss, I realised she was glowing golden and warming me up. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;I will never get used to that,&rdquo; I said, letting out a small laugh as I saw her whole self lighting up in the dark. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>&ldquo;What can I say? You have that effect on me,&rdquo; she said knowingly, a smug smile on her lips. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I laughed and shook my head at how cringey she was. She grinned and pressed a kiss to my forehead before pulling me close again, the two of us hugging and looking out over the balcony. </p><p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>I loved her so much.</p>",
