Moments of when you would cry in frustration because you had a bad shooting day. Moments of when Harry would bring you lunch on set, a small note with a \u201cHave a good day! Kick arses! I love you. x\u201d attached to it. </p><p>It had been tiring. And for Harry, it had been worrying too.</p><p>When you came home with a busted lip and a deep red scratch near your eye? He lost it. Eyes wide, hands sweating and a still body.</p><p>\u201cI know it looks like I had been at a fight, I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m okay, I promise.\u201d You had said slowly, wanting to get it through his head that no, you didn\u2019t need to go to the hospital and no, he shouldn\u2019t start setting 15 alarms on your phone to remind you to take your vitamins.</p><p>You and Harry met through Lou. Your makeup artist had gotten sick when you needed her and it seemed like watching a YouTube tutorial gave you next to no knowledge on how to accurately apply eyeliner. Your manager contacted another makeup artist who was fortunately free at the time of your event; the one and only Lou Teasdale.</p><p>From there, she was your go-to. Ditching the videos that taught you nothing but how much of a beginner you were and how there were much more than just lipstick to apply on your lips, Lou became a friend and a tutor.</p><p>She had taught you how to apply the \u201cno makeup-makeup\u201d look and after trying it on yourself and liking it, you wanted to try it on someone else. </p><p>It just so happened that Harry was visiting her.</p><p>Harry knew you were both friends at the time, having had ticked Lou off and almost begged her to let you both meet, he was gobsmacked when he saw you sitting on her sofa with w makeup brush in your hand and a bright smile on your face,</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew who you were. Everyone did. How can no one know the academy award winner who appeared in most successful and hit movies of the last few years? </p><p>It went upwards from there and it led to the relationship of three years and a cat, Evie.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Harry asks from outside the door, wide grin on his face as it beams with excitement, he\u2019s eager.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute!\u201d You reply, applying the last coat of mascara on your face and taking one last look at yourself.</p><p>You were in a black tuxedo, no shirt underneath as the blazer was buttoned with a long V-neck, hair slicked back, red lipstick on your lips.</p><p>You take a deep breath before opening the door, flinching when you realise just how close Harry was to the door.</p><p>His eyes widen, eyebrows going up as he looks at you up and down before releasing a wolf whistle that had you rolling your eyes as you blush, trying to suppress your giggle. </p><p>\u201cYou really are a superwoman.\u201d</p><p>You laugh, shaking your head, \u201cThat has to be the worst line you have ever used on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ve been practicing it all day.\u201d He jokes, smiling childishly as he looks at you before wrapping his arms around your waist, \u201cYou look so fucking good right now. You\u2019re,\u201d He pauses, squinting his eyes, \u201cEndgame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re awful!\u201d </p><p>Arriving at the premiere, the fans and cameras seemed to be anticipating your arrival because as soon as you and Harry step out of the car, it goes wild.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand is around your waist as you both walk, both of you giggling to each other about the reaction.</p><p>\u201cWas waiting for you!\u201d Tom Holland approaches you with a grin, perky as he hugs you before moving to Harry, \u201cBeen so long since I\u2019ve seen you, mate!

For being from the nice people, she d-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to spoil something.\u201d You warn cautiously.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I get that she has a rough past but my character seems to tick her off, although at the end, she hu-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTom.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-ugs me and I think it shows that we\u2019re going to have a siblings bond.

One is of you, Harry and Tom, Tom in the middle as he wraps his arms around both of your shoulders, looking as a kid whose parents took him to the zoo.</p><p>Robert takes one of the both of you kissing each of his cheeks, having claimed that you and Harry were his love children numerous times. </p><p>\u201cHey, you hogged them up without telling us!\u201d Mark attempts to seem cross but makes you laugh nevertheless, seeing him walking towards you with Scarlett and Paul, who pulls you into a group hug.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re not ready to see her in the movie.\u201d Paul raises his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he points at Harry.</p><p>Harry grins, wrapping his arm around your waist as you all smile to the cameras, \u201cI\u2019m never ready when it comes to her.\u201d He leans forward, pecking your cheek quickly, knowing well what it\u2019d do for the paps and fans.</p><p>\u201cAlright, couple photos. Let\u2019s leave them. Come on, party\u2019s over.\u201d Robert waves your cast mates off jokingly, looking back at you and giving you a wink which have you and Harry laughing.</p><p>\u201cParty just started, old man.\u201d You grin widely as Chris Evans walks towards you.</p><p>\u201cSave your breath, he\u2019s still team Tony.\u201d Robert puts his hand up, stopping Chris from reaching Harry.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, Harry\u2019s team Cap.

You look amazing tonight!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you, you look great yourself.\u201d You smile, hearing Harry thanking the man as well.</p><p>\u201cWho are you wearing, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing Gucci tonight. Feeling Gucci.\u201d You look down at yourself before smiling up.</p><p>\u201cWould you say that\u2019s Harry\u2019s impact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt definitely is,\u201d Harry chuckles, \u201cIt definitely is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, are you excited to see the movie? Any predictions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very excited. Very proud of this one right here. And no,\u201d He shakes his head slightly, \u201cNo predictions.

By the 10th minute, he stopped eating popcorn and you know it isn\u2019t because he was full, Lord knows he can finish 3 buckets on his own, but he was way too engrossed in the movie to miss a single letter over the noisy grains.</p><p>Seeing your hard work come to life is one the best feelings in the world, but seeing how Harry was into the movie, that\u2019s a whole other thing.</p><p>He gasped, muttered incoherent words under his breath, gave quiet orders to the characters as if they heard him and he cried. You watch as he grins when you appear in front of Thanos, absentmindedly giving one clap of excitement that leaves you amused as you watch him lovingly.</p><p>However, his grin falters when your character is thrown in the air by Thanos, going to the edge of his seat.</p><p>You mentally prepare yourself for the next scene, now knowing fully well that your boyfriend won\u2019t take it well.</p><p>In the scene, Thanos walks towards you, grips your throat as he raises you in the air, words of spite thrown at you.</p><p>\u201cThat fucker, no.\u201d Harry mumbles under his breath, \u201cI swear to God if she dies,\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get to finish his sentence when Captain America hits Thanos, making you drop as your character begins to catch breath.</p><p>This seems to be satisfying Harry because he releases a sigh of relief, sinking back in his chair before turning to look at you, \u201cThank God you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re still amused and flattered by his reaction, not processing when he leans to quickly peck your lips before going back to watching the movie.</p><p>By the end of the movie, Harry was emotional. As the movie ends, your boyfriend is the first person to stand and clap, everyone copying a second later as they applaud the cast and crew. Your eyes tear up, throwing yourself on Harry as you cry tears of joy.</p><p>His arms are wrapped tightly around you, head buried into your neck as he peppers your skin with soft kisses.</p><p>\u201cThat was so fucking good, that was so good,\u201d He cups your face, \u201cI\u2019m mad proud of you. I have no words.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He nods rapidly, face beaming with pride as he leans down to press his lips against yours, \u201cThat was incredible. You were incredible, I can\u2019t believe I get to call you my girlfriend.\u201d </p><p>You smile through the tears, holding tightly to his hands on your cheeks as you press yourself closer to him, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I feeling?\u201d He laughs, \u201cI\u2019m fucking wrecked, baby. I\u2019m,\u201d He stops to laugh slightly as he sniffles, \u201cThis ended me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stop the puns, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon, no.\u201d</p><p>With one last kiss, you leave Harry as you walk with the cast towards the stage, accepting Chris Evans\u2019s hand as he helps you up the stairs before you all stand side to side, you between Chris Pratt and Sebastian.</p><p>\u201cYour man\u2019s crying tears of pride right now.\u201d Chris leans to the side towards you, pointing at Harry as he stands clapping with everyone else, eyes set solely on you.</p><p>You giggle as you gave him a shrug, \u201cWon the lottery with that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell did.\u201d Seb agrees.</p><p>\u201cDo you all seriously have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him?! You can\u2019t blame us.\u201d</p><p>You smirk, pointing at Seb with a tilt of your head, \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s the last one to sit, a wide grin on his face as Robert begins to talk, making eye contact with you and giving you eager thumbs up and blowing you a kiss, mouthing a cheeky \u201cI love you\u201d.</p><p>You\u2019re a giggling mess, discreetly flipping Seb off as he cooes, waving at Harry with the other as you mouth back, \u201cI love you\u201d.</p><p>Harry is full of pride, he\u2019s sure that if it was possible, he literally would be smiling from ear to ear. And when it was your turn to talk? He couldn\u2019t not stand.</p><p>\u201cGod, this has been a journey,\u201d You chuckle as you talk into the microphone, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in life that will come close to how this lifetime experience felt. This was never about going to set, shooting and going home. It was about making a family out every single one of this cast. This has felt like home and no matter what happens, this will always be home. So many people I\u2019d like to thank but that\u2019s going to take all night so let me just say that, I love you all so much,\u201d You turn to look at your castmates who watch you with love and smiles, \u201cThank you so much for the opportunity and thank you,\u201d You smile at the audience as you reach your arm out, \u201cFor being amazing and,\u201d Your eyes fall on Harry as he stands with a hand on his heart, looking at you, \u201c<i>For supporting us.</i>\u201d </p><p>//</p><p>proud!boyfriend!harry is what we all need </p>",

Moments of when you would cry in frustration because you had a bad shooting day. Moments of when Harry would bring you lunch on set, a small note with a \u201cHave a good day! Kick arses! I love you. x\u201d attached to it. </p><p>It had been tiring. And for Harry, it had been worrying too.</p><p>When you came home with a busted lip and a deep red scratch near your eye? He lost it. Eyes wide, hands sweating and a still body.</p><p>\u201cI know it looks like I had been at a fight, I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m okay, I promise.\u201d You had said slowly, wanting to get it through his head that no, you didn\u2019t need to go to the hospital and no, he shouldn\u2019t start setting 15 alarms on your phone to remind you to take your vitamins.</p><p>You and Harry met through Lou. Your makeup artist had gotten sick when you needed her and it seemed like watching a YouTube tutorial gave you next to no knowledge on how to accurately apply eyeliner. Your manager contacted another makeup artist who was fortunately free at the time of your event; the one and only Lou Teasdale.</p><p>From there, she was your go-to. Ditching the videos that taught you nothing but how much of a beginner you were and how there were much more than just lipstick to apply on your lips, Lou became a friend and a tutor.</p><p>She had taught you how to apply the \u201cno makeup-makeup\u201d look and after trying it on yourself and liking it, you wanted to try it on someone else. </p><p>It just so happened that Harry was visiting her.</p><p>Harry knew you were both friends at the time, having had ticked Lou off and almost begged her to let you both meet, he was gobsmacked when he saw you sitting on her sofa with w makeup brush in your hand and a bright smile on your face,</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew who you were. Everyone did.

How are you?\u201d</p><p>You giggle at Tom\u2019s eager character, watching as him and your boyfriend interact before the three of you stand and pose for the camera, you in the middle.</p><p>\u201cYour girlfriend slapped the shit out of me in the movie. For being from the nice people, she d-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to spoil something.\u201d You warn cautiously.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I get that she has a rough past but my character seems to tick her off, although at the end, she hu-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTom.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-ugs me and I think it shows that we\u2019re going to have a siblings bond.

One is of you, Harry and Tom, Tom in the middle as he wraps his arms around both of your shoulders, looking as a kid whose parents took him to the zoo.</p><p>Robert takes one of the both of you kissing each of his cheeks, having claimed that you and Harry were his love children numerous times. </p><p>\u201cHey, you hogged them up without telling us!\u201d Mark attempts to seem cross but makes you laugh nevertheless, seeing him walking towards you with Scarlett and Paul, who pulls you into a group hug.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re not ready to see her in the movie.\u201d Paul raises his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he points at Harry.</p><p>Harry grins, wrapping his arm around your waist as you all smile to the cameras, \u201cI\u2019m never ready when it comes to her.\u201d He leans forward, pecking your cheek quickly, knowing well what it\u2019d do for the paps and fans.</p><p>\u201cAlright, couple photos. Let\u2019s leave them. Come on, party\u2019s over.\u201d Robert waves your cast mates off jokingly, looking back at you and giving you a wink which have you and Harry laughing.</p><p>\u201cParty just started, old man.\u201d You grin widely as Chris Evans walks towards you.</p><p>\u201cSave your breath, he\u2019s still team Tony.\u201d Robert puts his hand up, stopping Chris from reaching Harry.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, Harry\u2019s team Cap. He knows better.\u201d Chris feigns shock.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why he\u2019s team Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t believe that you both aren\u2019t 6.\u201d You shake your head jokingly.</p><p>You and Harry walk towards the reporters, hands intertwined securely with each other as you approach a man.</p><p>\u201cY/N, Harry! You look amazing tonight!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you, you look great yourself.\u201d You smile, hearing Harry thanking the man as well.</p><p>\u201cWho are you wearing, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing Gucci tonight.

By the 10th minute, he stopped eating popcorn and you know it isn\u2019t because he was full, Lord knows he can finish 3 buckets on his own, but he was way too engrossed in the movie to miss a single letter over the noisy grains.</p><p>Seeing your hard work come to life is one the best feelings in the world, but seeing how Harry was into the movie, that\u2019s a whole other thing.</p><p>He gasped, muttered incoherent words under his breath, gave quiet orders to the characters as if they heard him and he cried. You watch as he grins when you appear in front of Thanos, absentmindedly giving one clap of excitement that leaves you amused as you watch him lovingly.</p><p>However, his grin falters when your character is thrown in the air by Thanos, going to the edge of his seat.</p><p>You mentally prepare yourself for the next scene, now knowing fully well that your boyfriend won\u2019t take it well.</p><p>In the scene, Thanos walks towards you, grips your throat as he raises you in the air, words of spite thrown at you.</p><p>\u201cThat fucker, no.\u201d Harry mumbles under his breath, \u201cI swear to God if she dies,\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get to finish his sentence when Captain America hits Thanos, making you drop as your character begins to catch breath.</p><p>This seems to be satisfying Harry because he releases a sigh of relief, sinking back in his chair before turning to look at you, \u201cThank God you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re still amused and flattered by his reaction, not processing when he leans to quickly peck your lips before going back to watching the movie.</p><p>By the end of the movie, Harry was emotional. As the movie ends, your boyfriend is the first person to stand and clap, everyone copying a second later as they applaud the cast and crew. Your eyes tear up, throwing yourself on Harry as you cry tears of joy.</p><p>His arms are wrapped tightly around you, head buried into your neck as he peppers your skin with soft kisses.</p><p>\u201cThat was so fucking good, that was so good,\u201d He cups your face, \u201cI\u2019m mad proud of you.

Moments of when you would cry in frustration because you had a bad shooting day. Moments of when Harry would bring you lunch on set, a small note with a \u201cHave a good day! Kick arses! I love you. x\u201d attached to it. </p><p>It had been tiring. And for Harry, it had been worrying too.</p><p>When you came home with a busted lip and a deep red scratch near your eye? He lost it. Eyes wide, hands sweating and a still body.</p><p>\u201cI know it looks like I had been at a fight, I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m okay, I promise.\u201d You had said slowly, wanting to get it through his head that no, you didn\u2019t need to go to the hospital and no, he shouldn\u2019t start setting 15 alarms on your phone to remind you to take your vitamins.</p><p>You and Harry met through Lou. Your makeup artist had gotten sick when you needed her and it seemed like watching a YouTube tutorial gave you next to no knowledge on how to accurately apply eyeliner. Your manager contacted another makeup artist who was fortunately free at the time of your event; the one and only Lou Teasdale.</p><p>From there, she was your go-to. Ditching the videos that taught you nothing but how much of a beginner you were and how there were much more than just lipstick to apply on your lips, Lou became a friend and a tutor.</p><p>She had taught you how to apply the \u201cno makeup-makeup\u201d look and after trying it on yourself and liking it, you wanted to try it on someone else. </p><p>It just so happened that Harry was visiting her.</p><p>Harry knew you were both friends at the time, having had ticked Lou off and almost begged her to let you both meet, he was gobsmacked when he saw you sitting on her sofa with w makeup brush in your hand and a bright smile on your face,</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew who you were. Everyone did. How can no one know the academy award winner who appeared in most successful and hit movies of the last few years? </p><p>It went upwards from there and it led to the relationship of three years and a cat, Evie.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Harry asks from outside the door, wide grin on his face as it beams with excitement, he\u2019s eager.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute!\u201d You reply, applying the last coat of mascara on your face and taking one last look at yourself.</p><p>You were in a black tuxedo, no shirt underneath as the blazer was buttoned with a long V-neck, hair slicked back, red lipstick on your lips.</p><p>You take a deep breath before opening the door, flinching when you realise just how close Harry was to the door.</p><p>His eyes widen, eyebrows going up as he looks at you up and down before releasing a wolf whistle that had you rolling your eyes as you blush, trying to suppress your giggle. </p><p>\u201cYou really are a superwoman.\u201d</p><p>You laugh, shaking your head, \u201cThat has to be the worst line you have ever used on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ve been practicing it all day.\u201d He jokes, smiling childishly as he looks at you before wrapping his arms around your waist, \u201cYou look so fucking good right now. You\u2019re,\u201d He pauses, squinting his eyes, \u201cEndgame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you\u2019re awful!\u201d </p><p>Arriving at the premiere, the fans and cameras seemed to be anticipating your arrival because as soon as you and Harry step out of the car, it goes wild.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand is around your waist as you both walk, both of you giggling to each other about the reaction.</p><p>\u201cWas waiting for you!\u201d Tom Holland approaches you with a grin, perky as he hugs you before moving to Harry, \u201cBeen so long since I\u2019ve seen you, mate! How are you?\u201d</p><p>You giggle at Tom\u2019s eager character, watching as him and your boyfriend interact before the three of you stand and pose for the camera, you in the middle.</p><p>\u201cYour girlfriend slapped the shit out of me in the movie. For being from the nice people, she d-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to spoil something.\u201d You warn cautiously.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I get that she has a rough past but my character seems to tick her off, although at the end, she hu-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTom.\u201d</p><p>\u201c-ugs me and I think it shows that we\u2019re going to have a siblings bond. You know she\u2019s appearing my next SpiderMan movie, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Tom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes widen and as does his smile, \u201cBaby, you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because,\u201d You smile sarcastically as you look at Tom, \u201cIt was supposed to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes go wide, hand clasping to his mouth, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid causing you trouble?\u201d Everyone would know that voice anywhere. Robert appears in front of you, \u201cNice to see you, Harry. Still Team Tony, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles, hugging the man, \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong movie reference, rockstar.\u201d Chris Hemsworth jokes, \u201cLet me hug him, Rob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make your crush on my boyfriend any clearer?\u201d You joke, putting your arm around Tom\u2019s shoulders as he stands shorter than you.</p><p>\u201cIf I try, I\u2019m going to end up marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough of me to share.\u201d Harry adds, making everyone laugh as you begin to stand next to each other, posing for the eager cameras.</p><p>One photo is with Harry in the middle, you pretending to pull his left arm while Chris pulls the right one, Harry smirking for the cameras. One is of you, Harry and Tom, Tom in the middle as he wraps his arms around both of your shoulders, looking as a kid whose parents took him to the zoo.</p><p>Robert takes one of the both of you kissing each of his cheeks, having claimed that you and Harry were his love children numerous times. </p><p>\u201cHey, you hogged them up without telling us!\u201d Mark attempts to seem cross but makes you laugh nevertheless, seeing him walking towards you with Scarlett and Paul, who pulls you into a group hug.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019re not ready to see her in the movie.\u201d Paul raises his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he points at Harry.</p><p>Harry grins, wrapping his arm around your waist as you all smile to the cameras, \u201cI\u2019m never ready when it comes to her.\u201d He leans forward, pecking your cheek quickly, knowing well what it\u2019d do for the paps and fans.</p><p>\u201cAlright, couple photos. Let\u2019s leave them. Come on, party\u2019s over.\u201d Robert waves your cast mates off jokingly, looking back at you and giving you a wink which have you and Harry laughing.</p><p>\u201cParty just started, old man.\u201d You grin widely as Chris Evans walks towards you.</p><p>\u201cSave your breath, he\u2019s still team Tony.\u201d Robert puts his hand up, stopping Chris from reaching Harry.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, Harry\u2019s team Cap. He knows better.\u201d Chris feigns shock.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why he\u2019s team Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t believe that you both aren\u2019t 6.\u201d You shake your head jokingly.</p><p>You and Harry walk towards the reporters, hands intertwined securely with each other as you approach a man.</p><p>\u201cY/N, Harry! You look amazing tonight!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you, you look great yourself.\u201d You smile, hearing Harry thanking the man as well.</p><p>\u201cWho are you wearing, Y/N?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing Gucci tonight. Feeling Gucci.\u201d You look down at yourself before smiling up.</p><p>\u201cWould you say that\u2019s Harry\u2019s impact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt definitely is,\u201d Harry chuckles, \u201cIt definitely is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, are you excited to see the movie? Any predictions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very excited. Very proud of this one right here. And no,\u201d He shakes his head slightly, \u201cNo predictions. Every time I predict something, it never happens and my mind gets blown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved his breath this time.\u201d You pat Harry\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a smart decision,\u201d The reporter jokes, \u201cWell have a good night!\u201d</p><p>You both pose for more pictures, you pose for solo ones and cast ones and before you know it, it\u2019s time to see the movie.</p><p>\u201cVery tempted to throw popcorn at people right now.\u201d You say as you sit, Harry sitting beside you with your popcorn bucket in his hand.</p><p>He hushes you with a giggle, putting on his 3D glasses, \u201cMy girl\u2019s in that movie and I\u2019d rather watch her than get kicked out.\u201d</p><p>You blush, wearing your glasses as if it\u2019d hide the flustered look on your face.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe you fuck villains up and get shy when I say stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, movie\u2019s starting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say so, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>It\u2019s like Harry entered a world of his own. By the 10th minute, he stopped eating popcorn and you know it isn\u2019t because he was full, Lord knows he can finish 3 buckets on his own, but he was way too engrossed in the movie to miss a single letter over the noisy grains.</p><p>Seeing your hard work come to life is one the best feelings in the world, but seeing how Harry was into the movie, that\u2019s a whole other thing.</p><p>He gasped, muttered incoherent words under his breath, gave quiet orders to the characters as if they heard him and he cried. You watch as he grins when you appear in front of Thanos, absentmindedly giving one clap of excitement that leaves you amused as you watch him lovingly.</p><p>However, his grin falters when your character is thrown in the air by Thanos, going to the edge of his seat.</p><p>You mentally prepare yourself for the next scene, now knowing fully well that your boyfriend won\u2019t take it well.</p><p>In the scene, Thanos walks towards you, grips your throat as he raises you in the air, words of spite thrown at you.</p><p>\u201cThat fucker, no.\u201d Harry mumbles under his breath, \u201cI swear to God if she dies,\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get to finish his sentence when Captain America hits Thanos, making you drop as your character begins to catch breath.</p><p>This seems to be satisfying Harry because he releases a sigh of relief, sinking back in his chair before turning to look at you, \u201cThank God you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re still amused and flattered by his reaction, not processing when he leans to quickly peck your lips before going back to watching the movie.</p><p>By the end of the movie, Harry was emotional. As the movie ends, your boyfriend is the first person to stand and clap, everyone copying a second later as they applaud the cast and crew. Your eyes tear up, throwing yourself on Harry as you cry tears of joy.</p><p>His arms are wrapped tightly around you, head buried into your neck as he peppers your skin with soft kisses.</p><p>\u201cThat was so fucking good, that was so good,\u201d He cups your face, \u201cI\u2019m mad proud of you. I have no words.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He nods rapidly, face beaming with pride as he leans down to press his lips against yours, \u201cThat was incredible. You were incredible, I can\u2019t believe I get to call you my girlfriend.\u201d </p><p>You smile through the tears, holding tightly to his hands on your cheeks as you press yourself closer to him, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I feeling?\u201d He laughs, \u201cI\u2019m fucking wrecked, baby. I\u2019m,\u201d He stops to laugh slightly as he sniffles, \u201cThis ended me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stop the puns, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon, no.\u201d</p><p>With one last kiss, you leave Harry as you walk with the cast towards the stage, accepting Chris Evans\u2019s hand as he helps you up the stairs before you all stand side to side, you between Chris Pratt and Sebastian.</p><p>\u201cYour man\u2019s crying tears of pride right now.\u201d Chris leans to the side towards you, pointing at Harry as he stands clapping with everyone else, eyes set solely on you.</p><p>You giggle as you gave him a shrug, \u201cWon the lottery with that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell did.\u201d Seb agrees.</p><p>\u201cDo you all seriously have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him?! You can\u2019t blame us.\u201d</p><p>You smirk, pointing at Seb with a tilt of your head, \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s the last one to sit, a wide grin on his face as Robert begins to talk, making eye contact with you and giving you eager thumbs up and blowing you a kiss, mouthing a cheeky \u201cI love you\u201d.</p><p>You\u2019re a giggling mess, discreetly flipping Seb off as he cooes, waving at Harry with the other as you mouth back, \u201cI love you\u201d.</p><p>Harry is full of pride, he\u2019s sure that if it was possible, he literally would be smiling from ear to ear.

For being from the nice people, she d-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to spoil something.&rdquo; You warn cautiously.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I get that she has a rough past but my character seems to tick her off, although at the end, she hu-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-ugs me and I think it shows that we&rsquo;re going to have a siblings bond. You know she&rsquo;s appearing my next SpiderMan movie, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake, Tom!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes widen and as does his smile, &ldquo;Baby, you didn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because,&rdquo; You smile sarcastically as you look at Tom, &ldquo;It was supposed to be a surprise.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom&rsquo;s eyes go wide, hand clasping to his mouth, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid causing you trouble?&rdquo; Everyone would know that voice anywhere. Robert appears in front of you, &ldquo;Nice to see you, Harry. Still Team Tony, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry chuckles, hugging the man, &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wrong movie reference, rockstar.&rdquo; Chris Hemsworth jokes, &ldquo;Let me hug him, Rob.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you make your crush on my boyfriend any clearer?&rdquo; You joke, putting your arm around Tom&rsquo;s shoulders as he stands shorter than you.</p><p>&ldquo;If I try, I&rsquo;m going to end up marrying him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough of me to share.&rdquo; Harry adds, making everyone laugh as you begin to stand next to each other, posing for the eager cameras.</p><p>One photo is with Harry in the middle, you pretending to pull his left arm while Chris pulls the right one, Harry smirking for the cameras. One is of you, Harry and Tom, Tom in the middle as he wraps his arms around both of your shoulders, looking as a kid whose parents took him to the zoo.</p><p>Robert takes one of the both of you kissing each of his cheeks, having claimed that you and Harry were his love children numerous times. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you hogged them up without telling us!&rdquo; Mark attempts to seem cross but makes you laugh nevertheless, seeing him walking towards you with Scarlett and Paul, who pulls you into a group hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you&rsquo;re not ready to see her in the movie.&rdquo; Paul raises his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he points at Harry.</p><p>Harry grins, wrapping his arm around your waist as you all smile to the cameras, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never ready when it comes to her.&rdquo; He leans forward, pecking your cheek quickly, knowing well what it&rsquo;d do for the paps and fans.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, couple photos. Let&rsquo;s leave them. Come on, party&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; Robert waves your cast mates off jokingly, looking back at you and giving you a wink which have you and Harry laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Party just started, old man.&rdquo; You grin widely as Chris Evans walks towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Save your breath, he&rsquo;s still team Tony.&rdquo; Robert puts his hand up, stopping Chris from reaching Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Harry&rsquo;s team Cap. He knows better.&rdquo; Chris feigns shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Which is why he&rsquo;s team Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I can&rsquo;t believe that you both aren&rsquo;t 6.&rdquo; You shake your head jokingly.</p><p>You and Harry walk towards the reporters, hands intertwined securely with each other as you approach a man.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, Harry! You look amazing tonight!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, you look great yourself.&rdquo; You smile, hearing Harry thanking the man as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you wearing, Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing Gucci tonight. Feeling Gucci.&rdquo; You look down at yourself before smiling up.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you say that&rsquo;s Harry&rsquo;s impact?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It definitely is,&rdquo; Harry chuckles, &ldquo;It definitely is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, are you excited to see the movie? Any predictions?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited. Very proud of this one right here. And no,&rdquo; He shakes his head slightly, &ldquo;No predictions. Every time I predict something, it never happens and my mind gets blown.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He saved his breath this time.&rdquo; You pat Harry&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a smart decision,&rdquo; The reporter jokes, &ldquo;Well have a good night!&rdquo;</p><p>You both pose for more pictures, you pose for solo ones and cast ones and before you know it, it&rsquo;s time to see the movie.</p><p>&ldquo;Very tempted to throw popcorn at people right now.&rdquo; You say as you sit, Harry sitting beside you with your popcorn bucket in his hand.</p><p>He hushes you with a giggle, putting on his 3D glasses, &ldquo;My girl&rsquo;s in that movie and I&rsquo;d rather watch her than get kicked out.&rdquo;</p><p>You blush, wearing your glasses as if it&rsquo;d hide the flustered look on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe you fuck villains up and get shy when I say stuff like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush, movie&rsquo;s starting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you say so, gorgeous.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>It&rsquo;s like Harry entered a world of his own. By the 10th minute, he stopped eating popcorn and you know it isn&rsquo;t because he was full, Lord knows he can finish 3 buckets on his own, but he was way too engrossed in the movie to miss a single letter over the noisy grains.</p><p>Seeing your hard work come to life is one the best feelings in the world, but seeing how Harry was into the movie, that&rsquo;s a whole other thing.</p><p>He gasped, muttered incoherent words under his breath, gave quiet orders to the characters as if they heard him and he cried. You watch as he grins when you appear in front of Thanos, absentmindedly giving one clap of excitement that leaves you amused as you watch him lovingly.</p><p>However, his grin falters when your character is thrown in the air by Thanos, going to the edge of his seat.</p><p>You mentally prepare yourself for the next scene, now knowing fully well that your boyfriend won&rsquo;t take it well.</p><p>In the scene, Thanos walks towards you, grips your throat as he raises you in the air, words of spite thrown at you.</p><p>&ldquo;That fucker, no.&rdquo; Harry mumbles under his breath, &ldquo;I swear to God if she dies,&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t get to finish his sentence when Captain America hits Thanos, making you drop as your character begins to catch breath.</p><p>This seems to be satisfying Harry because he releases a sigh of relief, sinking back in his chair before turning to look at you, &ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re still amused and flattered by his reaction, not processing when he leans to quickly peck your lips before going back to watching the movie.</p><p>By the end of the movie, Harry was emotional. As the movie ends, your boyfriend is the first person to stand and clap, everyone copying a second later as they applaud the cast and crew. Your eyes tear up, throwing yourself on Harry as you cry tears of joy.</p><p>His arms are wrapped tightly around you, head buried into your neck as he peppers your skin with soft kisses.</p><p>&ldquo;That was so fucking good, that was so good,&rdquo; He cups your face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mad proud of you. I have no words.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; He nods rapidly, face beaming with pride as he leans down to press his lips against yours, &ldquo;That was incredible. You were incredible, I can&rsquo;t believe I get to call you my girlfriend.&rdquo; </p><p>You smile through the tears, holding tightly to his hands on your cheeks as you press yourself closer to him, &ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How am I feeling?&rdquo; He laughs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fucking wrecked, baby. I&rsquo;m,&rdquo; He stops to laugh slightly as he sniffles, &ldquo;This ended me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to stop the puns, are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not anytime soon, no.&rdquo;</p><p>With one last kiss, you leave Harry as you walk with the cast towards the stage, accepting Chris Evans&rsquo;s hand as he helps you up the stairs before you all stand side to side, you between Chris Pratt and Sebastian.</p><p>&ldquo;Your man&rsquo;s crying tears of pride right now.&rdquo; Chris leans to the side towards you, pointing at Harry as he stands clapping with everyone else, eyes set solely on you.</p><p>You giggle as you gave him a shrug, &ldquo;Won the lottery with that one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sure as hell did.&rdquo; Seb agrees.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you all seriously have a crush on him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen him?! You can&rsquo;t blame us.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirk, pointing at Seb with a tilt of your head, &ldquo;Good point.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s the last one to sit, a wide grin on his face as Robert begins to talk, making eye contact with you and giving you eager thumbs up and blowing you a kiss, mouthing a cheeky &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;.</p><p>You&rsquo;re a giggling mess, discreetly flipping Seb off as he cooes, waving at Harry with the other as you mouth back, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;.</p><p>Harry is full of pride, he&rsquo;s sure that if it was possible, he literally would be smiling from ear to ear. And when it was your turn to talk? He couldn&rsquo;t not stand.</p><p>&ldquo;God, this has been a journey,&rdquo; You chuckle as you talk into the microphone, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in life that will come close to how this lifetime experience felt. This was never about going to set, shooting and going home. It was about making a family out every single one of this cast. This has felt like home and no matter what happens, this will always be home. So many people I&rsquo;d like to thank but that&rsquo;s going to take all night so let me just say that, I love you all so much,&rdquo; You turn to look at your castmates who watch you with love and smiles, &ldquo;Thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you,&rdquo; You smile at the audience as you reach your arm out, &ldquo;For being amazing and,&rdquo; Your eyes fall on Harry as he stands with a hand on his heart, looking at you, &ldquo;<i>For supporting us.</i>&rdquo; </p><p>//</p><p>proud!boyfriend!harry is what we all need </p></p>",
