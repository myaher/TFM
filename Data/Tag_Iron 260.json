He hated the snow, he hated the cold and he hated that he had to wear lots of clothes to not freeze to death. </p><p>Tony on the other hand seemed to love them even if he stated otherwise. He said he didn\u2019t like the winters but then, it was him who suggested to go out into the park, it was him who initiated a snowball fight with a group of children, it was him who helped them build a snowman and Clint smiled happily when he saw his man playing in the snow like a child. And he would\u2019ve suggested to go ice skating on the small pond nearby but the ice was still too thin. Tony laughed and all the worry lines in his face were gone and he was so beautiful to look at at the moment. </p><p>\u201cHey, grumpy pants,\u201d he called and jogged over to him, \u201cI could need your help. They are winning,\u201d Tony grinned and pointed at the group of boys just making more snowballs. </p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Clint smiled and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019d be unfair.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Tony took his hand and tried to pull him to the kids. \u201cHelp!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Clint said. \u201cThere\u2019s a coffee shop over there,\u201d he pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, \u201cand I\u2019ll get us some coffee. I guess you should\u2019ve defeated your dangerous enemies by then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cParty pooper,\u201d Tony grinned but before he went back to the kids he stole a quick kiss from Clint. </p><p>Clint walked over to the coffee shop and groaned when he saw the line but he joined the end of the queue and kept watching Tony playing with the kids under the watchful eyes of their moms or nannies. But then his eyes were drawn to a young woman, walking in the park with a leash in her hand and calling someone, probably her dog. She seemed worried, Clint could see that even if she was far away. There was a reason why he got called Hawkeye. </p><p>But then it was his turn and he bought two coffees and two cookies and left the shop. He wanted to go back to Tony when the woman came up to him.</p><p>\u201cSir, have you seen my dog?\u201d she asked and Clint looked around. Maybe he could spot the dog but it was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he said and shrugged apologetically. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d the woman said and walked away. Clint turned to go back to Tony when he passed the small pond. In summer there were ducks and frogs but now there was ice on it\u2026 or should be. Because right now there was a hole and Clint could see the water underneath moving. </p><p>\u201cAww, dog, no,\u201d he cursed when he saw the tail of a dog for a second. And without a thought he put the coffee and the cookies down on a bench and went to the pond, tried to lie down on the ice and to rob to the hole but - still - the ice was too thin and he fell through, too. </p><p>From one moment to the next it felt as if his breath froze in his lungs and he gasped for air, his thick jacket was soaked through in an instant. Fortunately the pond wasn\u2019t too deep, just to his waist so at least he didn\u2019t have to swim. </p><p>He found the dog, who was weakly struggling by now and Clint grabbed it and pulled it out of the water. </p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he could hear the woman from behind him. \u201cDodger! You found him!\u201d </p><p>Clint\u2019s teeth chattered and he went back but thanks to the struggling dog he slid and fell on his knee and the ice cold water hit his chin. With a curse on his lips he rose and managed to get out of the pond and he put the dog down. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the woman breathed and wrapped it in her jacket. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d She hurried away and Clint fell down on his knees. He felt dizzy and really, really tired. He wasn\u2019t too long in the water but it\u2019s been so cold. He wrapped his arms around himself. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he slurred and tried to rise but his knees refused to work properly. The woman was hurried away and had left him sitting beside the pond.

            "comment": "<p><b>Whumptober - Day 11: Hypothermia</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>Winter in New York wasn\u2019t like the winters back home in Iowa, but one thing they had in common. Clint hated them. He hated the snow, he hated the cold and he hated that he had to wear lots of clothes to not freeze to death. </p><p>Tony on the other hand seemed to love them even if he stated otherwise. He said he didn\u2019t like the winters but then, it was him who suggested to go out into the park, it was him who initiated a snowball fight with a group of children, it was him who helped them build a snowman and Clint smiled happily when he saw his man playing in the snow like a child. And he would\u2019ve suggested to go ice skating on the small pond nearby but the ice was still too thin. Tony laughed and all the worry lines in his face were gone and he was so beautiful to look at at the moment. </p><p>\u201cHey, grumpy pants,\u201d he called and jogged over to him, \u201cI could need your help. They are winning,\u201d Tony grinned and pointed at the group of boys just making more snowballs. </p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Clint smiled and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019d be unfair.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Tony took his hand and tried to pull him to the kids. \u201cHelp!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Clint said. \u201cThere\u2019s a coffee shop over there,\u201d he pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, \u201cand I\u2019ll get us some coffee. I guess you should\u2019ve defeated your dangerous enemies by then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cParty pooper,\u201d Tony grinned but before he went back to the kids he stole a quick kiss from Clint. </p><p>Clint walked over to the coffee shop and groaned when he saw the line but he joined the end of the queue and kept watching Tony playing with the kids under the watchful eyes of their moms or nannies. But then his eyes were drawn to a young woman, walking in the park with a leash in her hand and calling someone, probably her dog. She seemed worried, Clint could see that even if she was far away. There was a reason why he got called Hawkeye. </p><p>But then it was his turn and he bought two coffees and two cookies and left the shop. He wanted to go back to Tony when the woman came up to him.</p><p>\u201cSir, have you seen my dog?\u201d she asked and Clint looked around. Maybe he could spot the dog but it was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he said and shrugged apologetically. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d the woman said and walked away. Clint turned to go back to Tony when he passed the small pond. In summer there were ducks and frogs but now there was ice on it\u2026 or should be. Because right now there was a hole and Clint could see the water underneath moving. </p><p>\u201cAww, dog, no,\u201d he cursed when he saw the tail of a dog for a second. And without a thought he put the coffee and the cookies down on a bench and went to the pond, tried to lie down on the ice and to rob to the hole but - still - the ice was too thin and he fell through, too. </p><p>From one moment to the next it felt as if his breath froze in his lungs and he gasped for air, his thick jacket was soaked through in an instant. Fortunately the pond wasn\u2019t too deep, just to his waist so at least he didn\u2019t have to swim. </p><p>He found the dog, who was weakly struggling by now and Clint grabbed it and pulled it out of the water. </p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he could hear the woman from behind him. \u201cDodger! You found him!\u201d </p><p>Clint\u2019s teeth chattered and he went back but thanks to the struggling dog he slid and fell on his knee and the ice cold water hit his chin. With a curse on his lips he rose and managed to get out of the pond and he put the dog down. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the woman breathed and wrapped it in her jacket. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d She hurried away and Clint fell down on his knees. He felt dizzy and really, really tired. He wasn\u2019t too long in the water but it\u2019s been so cold. He wrapped his arms around himself. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he slurred and tried to rise but his knees refused to work properly. The woman was hurried away and had left him sitting beside the pond. He looked around and saw Tony in the distance, building a snow castle with the kids. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he whispered. His teeth clattered so badly now and he crawled on his knees to the bench. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, Clint!\u201d Tony had finally seen him and came over.

Coffee is her fuel in life, and constant walking just makes her happy.</p><p>Y/n is almost home when she sees a rather large portal in the sky of upper New York. </p><p>She puffs out her cheeks in annoyance and confusion. She whispers &ldquo;I thought I just took out a bad guy.. being a hero is hard.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/n put her mask back on and threw her coffee in a nearby dumpster. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m most definitely going to get sick mid fight because of that damn coffee..&rsquo; she thought. After all, she always did. </p><p>She ran and jumped over a car with her skills of agility, and jumped onto a zip line that took her closer to the major battle happening in the heart of the city. </p><p>As the battle of New York increased, y/n only got closer and closer. When the line could no longer go any futher, she jumped by using the bulit up momentum to a nearby building. </p><p>She strapped the bookbag onto her back for safety, then analyzed the area with her mask.. to oddly read Hawkeye&rsquo;s bio. Her mask narrowed onto his form on a roof top. </p><p>&ldquo;The Avengers are here..&rdquo; she mumbled. Y/n wondered, should she fight with them and expose herself or leave the city to it&rsquo;s own devices? </p><p>She inhaled deeply, and turnt around, while the battle for New York pushed onward.</p><p>&ldquo;Not worth it. It&rsquo;s no use to expose myself now when there could be a much more pressing matter in the future.&rdquo; She explained to the recorder, that was in her right hand. &ldquo;I wish them luck.&rdquo; </p><p>                       <span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">&#8906;&#8903;&#8903;&#8905;</span></p><p>On the other side of New York, Tony Stark turnt to the general area y/n was just standing.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir. .
