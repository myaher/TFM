        "body": "<h2><b>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: Hermione\u2019s Secret</b></h2><p>Good God Snape, can you stop being obsessed with revenge for five minutes?</p><p>Well since Snape treats any other student like shit, yes you could say he treats Harry like any other student</p><p>Aww look at that, for the first time, all three of them are in the hospital wing together</p><p>What is the remedy for facing a dementor for someone who really doesn\u2019t like chocolate?</p><p>Lol, Madame Pomfrey just stuffing chocolate into Harry\u2019s mouth to shut him up and then shoving him into bed is hilarious, sorry Harry</p><p>Poppy Pomfrey is a nice name</p><p>I wonder what compelled Dumbledore to go to Harry and Hermione to fix this, like, what made him believe Sirius? Did Sirius turn into a dog to show him the truth? That if he\u2019s an unregistered Animagus, then the possibility of Pettigrew being one is also high? Did the expression of grief or remorse on Sirius\u2019 face convince Dumbledore? Will we ever know?</p><p>I <i>cannot believe</i> that Hermione, the brightest witch of her age, just <i>FORGOT </i>she had a device that could manipulate time\u2026 I get that a lot of stuff happened tonight, but like, when she was lying in the hospital bed at least, couldn\u2019t she have remembered? Was she panicking too much to remember? Ok, I\u2019ll give her that\u2026 she is only human, and also a child</p><p>Oh snap, they went from the hospital wing to the deserted entrance hall\u2026 but how? Does it take you back to where you last were at that specific time? Isn\u2019t that bad for when you\u2019re trying not to get caught by your other self?</p><p>Wooow, so all that stuff happened within three hours?? They weren\u2019t passed out for too long I guess, or all that other stuff happened pretty quick and they were passed out for a couple of hours</p><p>I love how Dumbledore had full faith that they\u2019d pull off this insane plan\u2026 I suppose he literally had no other option, and he himself couldn\u2019t do it</p><p>Gosh, I wonder how many times Hermione has done third year then\u2026 that\u2019s basically what this means right? Going back in time and re-using the same hours</p><p>I love this Harry Hermione quality time adventure\u2026 this is actually one of the things that made me think that they were going to end up together lol</p><p>The map of Hogwarts that they provided at the start of the book is proving itself very handy now</p><p>Lol yeah, I still don\u2019t know how they pulled off the Buckbeak rescue thing, especially since they had to wait for the ministry people to see that Buckbeak was tied outside \u2018&hellip;\u201dThat gives us about sixty seconds,\u201d&hellip;\u2019 lol</p><p>OH, I just realised! What if Dumbledore already saw them saving Buckbeak? So maybe that\u2019s how he knew that they were meant to be the ones to follow through with this plan!</p><p>Wait a minute\u2026 if he saw them he\u2019d have just assumed that it\u2019s the regular Harry and Hermione, not the future ones\u2026 ah let\u2019s continue and see if we find any more clues</p><p>Wow, the stakes are really high with this time-turner\u2026 people have ended up accidentally killing their past/future selves! And McGonagall gave it to Hermione! I know she\u2019s smart and responsible and all\u2026 but she\u2019s also <i>thirteen</i></p><p>OK, IT\u2019S TIME GUYS! GO GO GO</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I never noticed that the executioner\u2019s name is <i>Walden</i>\u2026 that\u2019s such a dumb name lol</p><p>OH OK! So Dumbledore saw that Buckbeak escaped somehow and when he found out what happened at the lake, he realised something was up and it probably had something to do with the time-turner! So that\u2019s what convinced him\u2026 things that had already happened</p><p>It\u2019s very difficult to wrap my head around it lol\u2026 how have people with time-turners not gone crazy? Why didn\u2019t McGonagall just tell Hermione that she couldn\u2019t choose all the subjects and had to just make up her mind already? Especially considering the amount of energy she\u2019d have to use</p><p>Aww this time they could hear Hagrid\u2019s words through the sobs</p><p>\u2018&hellip; Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy\u2026\u2019 LOL I like that they used the same words for the movie</p><p>Gasp! Harry thought he saw his <i>dad</i>? His dad who is dead? But\u2026 how can that be?? Dun dun <i>duuuuun</i></p><p>Harry kept beating around the bushes before he finally told Hermione he thought he saw his dad for good reason because then Hermione reacted with alarm <i>and </i>pity</p><p>I always feel sad when he\u2019s trying to explain to Hermione that he\u2019d seen photos of his father and the person at the lake looked like his father</p><p>Aww\u2026 he\u2019s \u00a0so hopeful that he could\u2019ve seen his dad</p><p>We learn so much about James in this book</p><p>Ok so they were in the tree for over an hour, that means they were passed out for a fairly short time, how long are people usually passed out for?</p><p>TGFH</p><p>Oh\u2026 I see&hellip; They had to do it before Sirius was given up to the dementors because if they knew that he was gone, they\u2019d have failed the mission, so they had to go back in time before that happened so that they could have a chance of saving him\u2026 does that make sense? Like, they didn\u2019t know what the outcome was going to be, and with that in mind, they were basically free to do whatever they could to save him because they didn\u2019t know if they were going to fail or not. With Buckbeak, Dumbledore knew they\u2019d succeeded, and keeping that in mind, he had to tell them to save Sirius too before he accompanied Fudge to give Sirius up to the dementors\u2026 I get it now</p><p>I suppose the takeaway here is that whatever you decide to do now, that\u2019s what matters the most</p><p>OH WOW OK, so I guess I keep remembering the movie and forgetting the book lol, they absolutely avoided a terrible fate with the werewolf very quickly there\u2026 good thinking Harry</p><p>Oh yeah\u2026 whoever had sent that Patronus is going to show up soon!</p><p>GUYS GET READY IT\u2019S THE BEST PART</p><p>Here it is, he\u2019s waiting for someone to come, waiting for someone to save him, but no one\u2019s coming&hellip;</p><p>Oh? He\u2019d seen himself you say?

And he mistook himself for his father??</p><p>The only person that could save him, was himself&hellip; it&rsquo;s a lesson that we are stronger than we think and able to overcome more than we know, it&rsquo;s such an important lesson!</p><p>I also love that Hermione was like, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do the thing I told you not to do&rdquo; and then he does exactly that lol, I suppose it&rsquo;s what saved him and he&rsquo;s lucky that he&rsquo;d basically passed out, so he didn&rsquo;t see exactly who saved him, but also he realised that he&rsquo;d already seen himself do it so it was instrumental in a way?</p><p>It was a stag? Interesting&hellip;</p><p>Prongs!</p><p>I like that they didn&rsquo;t tell us what James&rsquo; animal form was earlier&hellip; finding out this way is infinitely better</p><p>And in a way, his father did save him through himself</p><p>Oooh, about to get ripped apart by Hermione!</p><p>It must&rsquo;ve been really hard to knock on the window while Buckbeak was flying</p><p>I like how Sirius is at a loss for words and they&rsquo;re just like, &lsquo;can you hurry up and escape already? THEY ARE GOING TO KILL YOU SIRIUS! Jeez!&rsquo; LOL</p><p>I also like that Sirius asked about Ron&hellip; aww</p><p>They did it!</p></p>",
