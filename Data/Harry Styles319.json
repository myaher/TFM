He knew that there was a court order that said he couldn\u2019t have any contact with Oliver, but he didn\u2019t think that the nursery staff would know that. He straightened his shirt and opened the door to the nursery room, to be greeted by an older lady putting things away in the children\u2019s bags. </p><p>\u201cHi Sir\u201d she said \u201ccan I help you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here to pick up Oliver\u201d </p><p>She looked him up and down sternly, \u201cOliver\u2019s mum said his dad would be picking him up this afternoon\u201d </p><p>A smile spread across Danny\u2019s face \u201cI\u2019m his dad\u201d he said proudly </p><!-- more --><p>The lady grew even more confused with that statement \u201cI\u2019ve met Oliver\u2019s dad before sir, are you on his contact list?\u201d She finished putting things in bags and turned to face Danny directly </p><p>\u201cI should be\u201d he lied, knowing perfectly well that he wasn\u2019t </p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll just check that before I take you through\u201d she smiled \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDaniel Watts\u201d </p><p>She frowned not recognising the name \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask you to wait here while I check\u201d she turned around and exited the room, making her way towards the play room where they kept the information of all the children\u2019s contacts in an easily accessible file. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sarah, one of the other educators asked </p><p>\u201cOli\u2019s real dad is here and I\u2019m not sure y/n or Harry know anything about it\u201d Margaret grimaced </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they have a court order against him\u201d Bonnie added </p><p>Margaret read down Oli\u2019s list of contacts seeing only yourself, Harry and Gemma on there. </p><p>\u201cWell he\u2019s not in the list\u201d she frowned and looked around the room for oli \u201cwhere is oli?\u201d She asked the two other girls </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still asleep\u201d Bonnie added </p><p>\u201cOk, can you keep an eye on him while I go and talk to this man, and Sarah, do you mind giving y/n a call and telling her what\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>They both nodded and Margaret handed Sarah the contact list so that she could find your number </p><p>\u201cY/N said this morning when she dropped him off to call Harry if we needed anything\u201d Bonnie said, she was only the early shift, which meant that she had taken messages from all the parents that day.</p><p>\u201cOk, call Harry then, but first call out to reception and let Clara know what going on so she can give me a hand, I have a feeling he won\u2019t leave easily\u201d </p><p>Clara was the manager of the centre and was the best person to turn to in these situations, so Sarah dialled the extension that connected to the front office and asked Clara to come into the babies room to help out. Once she\u2019s done that, Margaret went back out into the locker room to confront him. </p><p>\u201cMr Watts\u201d she smiled, closing the door behind her \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not on Oliver\u2019s contact list, so I can\u2019t let you take him today\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit\u201d he yelled \u201che\u2019s my son\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask that you keep your voice down sir, we have babies that are still asleep\u201d Clara said walking into the room. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son and I won\u2019t be leaving without him\u201d Danny said firmly</p><p>\u201cWe have one of other staff \u00a0members on the phone to his dad-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep-dad\u201d Danny interrupted </p><p>Margaret drew her lips into a sharp line \u201cif he doesn\u2019t give the ok for you to take oli than I will have to ask you to leave\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be leaving, that prick has no right to my son\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Watts\u201d Clara said, making him focus on her \u201cI\u2019m going to ask that you step into my office, while we wait for Mr Styles to be contacted, I can\u2019t have you waiting here like this\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d he said with fire in his voice \u201chas no right to be contacted\u201d </p><p>\u201cAccording to our files, Mr Styles is Oliver\u2019s legal guardian, there\u2019s a note in his file that says you have no legal rights to to him, so while we\u2019re on the in the phone to his legal guardian I\u2019ll ask that \u00a0you step \u00a0outside\u201d Clara said ushering him out the door. He obliged, knowing that she had every right to have him removed from the premises if he didn\u2019t do as he was asked. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHello\u201d Harry said into the his phone as he ducked out of the studio </p><p>\u201cHi Harry, it\u2019s Sarah here from Oliver\u2019s nursery\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi Sarah, is everything ok?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOli\u2019s fine, he\u2019s still having his nap, but we\u2019re having a situation here\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkayyy\u201d Harry said confused \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have a Mr Daniel Watts here, trying to to pick Oli up, we haven\u2019t allowed him into the play room, but he\u2019s refusing to leave\u201d </p><p>\u201cShit\u201d he said with a sense of urgency in his voice \u201che\u2019s Oli\u2019s biological dad, but he we\u2019ve got a court order against him, he\u2019s not allowed any contact\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we thought\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come in and get Oli\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll try and wake him up, thank you Harry\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem, see you soon\u201d he hung up the phone and quickly walked back to the studio to get his things. </p><p>\u201cI have to go\u201d he said darkly, unable to focus on anything else. He trusted the nursery to keep Oli safe, but he didn\u2019t trust Danny to leave before he got his way. The car was parked in a side street a block away but the nursery was a block away in the other direction, so he lifted his hoodie up over his head and began jogging toward his sons school. At this point, he was glad that he\u2019d been training hard in the gym, and as the nursery appeared in view he slowed down to a walk, composing himself before he walked him. </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d Clara said with a smile on her face \u201cthank you for coming on such short notice\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem\u201d he smiled back </p><p>\u201cMr Watts is in my office if you\u2019d like to speak to him.\u201d </p><p>Harry could tell by the tone of her voice that she needed the extra help to try and get him to leave. </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d he followed her into the office, thinking that it would be best to talk to him without Oli around. </p><p>\u201cHarry\u201d Danny said, taking a step toward him </p><p>\u201cMr Watts\u201d Harry said, reaching out to shake his hand, meeting his eyes with a sharp stare \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up my son\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your son until he\u2019s two and you file for parental rights again, and I don\u2019t believe this little incident will look good on your record, and trust me\u201d Harry smirked \u201cit will be on your record, because as soon as I get Oli home I\u2019ll be calling my lawyers\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnce he turns two they\u2019ll have no choice but to grant me parental rights\u201d Danny added in a snarky tone </p><p>\u201cMr Watts,\u201d Clara interpreted the two of them, aware of the commotion it was causing \u201csince Mr Styles here has made it clear that you are not legally allowed contact with Oliver, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave the premises\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going until I see my son\u201d Danny stood his ground. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll have to call the police then\u201d she picked up the phone and dialled the number of the local police, watching as Danny remained still in his place. Harry shook his head at the idiocy Danny was displaying, but remained quietly hopeful that it would mean that He would be able to officially adopt Oli sooner than he thought.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on their way to escort you off the premises\u201d Clara said hanging up the phone and walked towards the door, ushering Harry out as she left Danny standing frozen in his spot. </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry said as she closed the door behind her </p><p>\u201cNo problem Harry\u201d she smiled and rested her hand on his shoulder \u201cit\u2019s my job, you go get your son\u201d </p><p>He nodded \u201cI\u2019ll stick around until the police get here, in case he causes anymore trouble\u201d he smirked \u201cand so I can watch him get escorted away\u201d </p><p>She laughed \u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted, they said they\u2019d only be about five minutes\u201d </p><p>Harry nodded and turned and walked into the babies room to find Margaret and Sarah gathered around the door, trying to eavesdrop on what was going on. </p><p>\u201cHello ladies\u201d Harry said, cheeky smile spread across his face </p><p>\u201cHi Harry\u201d Margaret said \u201ceverything ok out there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep, police are on their way to escort him away from the area\u201d </p><p>\u201cPolice!?\u201d Thats intense\u201d Sarah said, sounding concerned </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s refusing to leave\u201d Harry shrugged \u201cnot the best idea if you ask me, our court order runs out when ol turns two and he can file again, but with attempted kidnaping to his name that\u2019s not going to end well.\u201d Now that he knew that Oli was safe, Harry found the whole situation quite funny. </p><p>\u201cOli\u2019s better off with you, we can all testify to that\u201d Margaret said </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d Harry smiled \u201cwhere is the little man?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBonnie\u2019s still trying to wake up\u201d Sarah gestured towards the room where he was still sleeping soundly. </p><p>\u201cCan I go into the cot room?\u201d Harry asked </p><p>Margaret checked the chart outside the door \u201cOf course, but there\u2019s a few others in there, so keep it down, we need them to sleep longer\u201d she smiled </p><p>Harry slid the door open and saw Bonnie gently trying to wake Oliver from his sleep. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hard to wake\u201d Harry said softly, walking towards his cot \u201cOli,\u201d he cooed \u201cdaddy\u2019s here to take you home\u201d</p><p>He stirred slightly at the sound of Harry\u2019s voice, but remained asleep. Not wanting to miss Danny being escorted away, Harry took down the side of the cot and gently lifted him up into his arms, allowing him to rest his head on his shoulder and remain asleep.</p><p>\u201cIs he back tomorrow?\u201d Bonnie asked before she took the sheets from his bed </p><p>\u201cNormally yes\u201d Harry said softly \u201cbut I think I\u2019ll take tomorrow off keep him home\u201d</p><p>Bonnie nodded and stripped the bed, handing the sheets to Harry \u201cI\u2019ll give you these then\u201d she smiled and lead Harry out of the room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep him home tomorrow\u201d Harry said to Margaret, who was the room leader, as he walked out, and she nodded at him. </p><p>\u201cGood idea, we\u2019ll see you next week then\u201d Margaret said and handed Harry Oli\u2019s bag \u201cenjoy watching him get escorted out\u201d she laughed </p><p>\u201cOh I will\u201d he laughed quietly, aware that Oli was still sleeping on his shoulder. </p><p>Harry walked out of the babies room as the Police were being greeted by Clara. </p><p>\u201cHow long has he been here?\u201d one of the officers asked, taking his notepad out. </p><p>\u201cOnly about half an hour, he came in and went straight into our under two\u2019s room, and asked to pick up one of the children\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd what did your staff do at that point? - We need this information in case the parents of the child want to take him to court.\u201d the officer had already taken down some notes and Harry stood in the corner watching on, subtly taking a seat in one of the arm chairs and searching through Oli\u2019s bag, making sure itchy was in there. </p><p>\u201cThey asked him to stay in the locker room away from the children, and checked our files to see if he was on the contact list for the child, when he wasn\u2019t, he was asked to leave, and we contacted his legal guardian\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect\u201d the officer said \u201cso the parents are aware of this happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes\u201d clara nodded \u201cMr Styles, his legal guardian, is here now to collect him\u201d </p><p>\u201cHello\u201d Harry interrupted, standing up from his chair. </p><p>\u201cOh Harry\u201d Clara laughed \u201cI didn\u2019t see you come out of there- little angel still sleeping?\u201d she smiled at Oli who was snoring on Harry\u2019s shoulder </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s impossible to wake\u201d Harry smiled </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d the officer said \u201cOfficer Bentley\u201d he held out his hand and Harry shook it , \u201cyou mind if I ask a few questions about the court order you and your wife have against Mr Watts?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d Harry shifted Oli gently in his arms </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt\u201d Clara said before the officer had a chance to take ask harry a question \u201cbut do you mind if we take this into the staff room, we quite often get parents coming to pick their children up around this time, and I\u2019d like to make sure Harry has as much privacy with all of this as possible\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou lead the way\u201d Officer Bentley smiled, closing his notepad. Clara led them both down the hallway into a room filled with sofas and a large white table where Harry sat across from the officer, shifting Oli so that he could sleep on Harry\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cAll the staff have had their breaks, so you won\u2019t be interrupted\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d Harry smiled </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you want this on record Mr Styles?\u201d Bentley said as Clara closed the door behind her. </p><p>\u201cI would, yes\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d he nodded and took out his notepad again \u201cbecause he never left the premises with your child, we can\u2019t press any charges, but we can make record of it\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Harry said, trying to keep his voice down </p><p>\u201cMy colleague is talking to Mr Watts briefly before we escort him away, but I\u2019d just like to get some information from you about the court order, so could you tell what that says about your relationship to, Oliver?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUntil he\u2019s two I\u2019m his step father, I have parental responsibility and myself and my wife have full custody\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd what happens when he turns two?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Watts is able to file for parental responsibility, and if a judge can see that he has improved his situation it will be granted, if he doesn\u2019t file, or his request is denied, then I am able to adopt him\u201d </p><p>Bentley took notes as Harry spoke \u201cand how old is oliver now?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201c18 months\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd does the court order say anything about visitation within those two years?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not allowed any contact\u201d Harry said flatly and officer bentley drew his lips into a sharp line. </p><p>\u201cWell unfortunately, because the staff here have done such a good job at keeping your son safe, he\u2019s not technically in violation of the order because no contact was made, but the attempt will be noted and brought to the attention of the judge when and if he files in the next six months\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Harry said \u201cThanks for your help\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy pleasure Mr Styles\u201d he smiled at Harry and stood up \u201cNow, would you like the pleasure of watching him escorted off the premises?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely\u201d Harry said, with a cheeky grin spreading across his face and he stood up, again careful not to wake Oli. Bentley lead harry from the staff room and into the main foyer where his colleague was standing with Danny, holding on tightly to his arm. </p><p> \u201cMr Watts\u201d Bentley said \u201cWe\u2019re going to go now, and you\u2019re not going to make a fuss or we will arrest you for being on private property\u201d </p><p>Oli stirred in Harry\u2019s arms, blinking his eyes open while Harry watched Danny shrug his shoulders and walk quietly out of the centre, with both officers holding onto him. </p><p>\u201cHi little man\u201d Harry cooed quietly so that Danny wouldn\u2019t hear him and cause a scene realising that Oli was awake. Oli lifted his had from Harry\u2019s chest and looked around the room, waking up a little confused and Harry shifted him onto his hip so that he could see what was happening around him. </p><p>\u201cOli wave bye bye?\u201d Harry asked in a soothing tone, waving his hand to show Oli what to do. </p><p>\u201cBye Bye\u201d Oli said softly, waving his hand at Danny. </p>",

He knew that there was a court order that said he couldn\u2019t have any contact with Oliver, but he didn\u2019t think that the nursery staff would know that. He straightened his shirt and opened the door to the nursery room, to be greeted by an older lady putting things away in the children\u2019s bags. </p><p>\u201cHi Sir\u201d she said \u201ccan I help you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here to pick up Oliver\u201d </p><p>She looked him up and down sternly, \u201cOliver\u2019s mum said his dad would be picking him up this afternoon\u201d </p><p>A smile spread across Danny\u2019s face \u201cI\u2019m his dad\u201d he said proudly </p>[[MORE]]<p>The lady grew even more confused with that statement \u201cI\u2019ve met Oliver\u2019s dad before sir, are you on his contact list?\u201d She finished putting things in bags and turned to face Danny directly </p><p>\u201cI should be\u201d he lied, knowing perfectly well that he wasn\u2019t </p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll just check that before I take you through\u201d she smiled \u201cwhat\u2019s your name?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDaniel Watts\u201d </p><p>She frowned not recognising the name \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask you to wait here while I check\u201d she turned around and exited the room, making her way towards the play room where they kept the information of all the children\u2019s contacts in an easily accessible file. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sarah, one of the other educators asked </p><p>\u201cOli\u2019s real dad is here and I\u2019m not sure y/n or Harry know anything about it\u201d Margaret grimaced </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they have a court order against him\u201d Bonnie added </p><p>Margaret read down Oli\u2019s list of contacts seeing only yourself, Harry and Gemma on there. </p><p>\u201cWell he\u2019s not in the list\u201d she frowned and looked around the room for oli \u201cwhere is oli?\u201d She asked the two other girls </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still asleep\u201d Bonnie added </p><p>\u201cOk, can you keep an eye on him while I go and talk to this man, and Sarah, do you mind giving y/n a call and telling her what\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>They both nodded and Margaret handed Sarah the contact list so that she could find your number </p><p>\u201cY/N said this morning when she dropped him off to call Harry if we needed anything\u201d Bonnie said, she was only the early shift, which meant that she had taken messages from all the parents that day.</p><p>\u201cOk, call Harry then, but first call out to reception and let Clara know what going on so she can give me a hand, I have a feeling he won\u2019t leave easily\u201d </p><p>Clara was the manager of the centre and was the best person to turn to in these situations, so Sarah dialled the extension that connected to the front office and asked Clara to come into the babies room to help out. Once she\u2019s done that, Margaret went back out into the locker room to confront him. </p><p>\u201cMr Watts\u201d she smiled, closing the door behind her \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not on Oliver\u2019s contact list, so I can\u2019t let you take him today\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit\u201d he yelled \u201che\u2019s my son\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask that you keep your voice down sir, we have babies that are still asleep\u201d Clara said walking into the room. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son and I won\u2019t be leaving without him\u201d Danny said firmly</p><p>\u201cWe have one of other staff \u00a0members on the phone to his dad-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep-dad\u201d Danny interrupted </p><p>Margaret drew her lips into a sharp line \u201cif he doesn\u2019t give the ok for you to take oli than I will have to ask you to leave\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be leaving, that prick has no right to my son\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Watts\u201d Clara said, making him focus on her \u201cI\u2019m going to ask that you step into my office, while we wait for Mr Styles to be contacted, I can\u2019t have you waiting here like this\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d he said with fire in his voice \u201chas no right to be contacted\u201d </p><p>\u201cAccording to our files, Mr Styles is Oliver\u2019s legal guardian, there\u2019s a note in his file that says you have no legal rights to to him, so while we\u2019re on the in the phone to his legal guardian I\u2019ll ask that \u00a0you step \u00a0outside\u201d Clara said ushering him out the door. He obliged, knowing that she had every right to have him removed from the premises if he didn\u2019t do as he was asked. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHello\u201d Harry said into the his phone as he ducked out of the studio </p><p>\u201cHi Harry, it\u2019s Sarah here from Oliver\u2019s nursery\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi Sarah, is everything ok?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOli\u2019s fine, he\u2019s still having his nap, but we\u2019re having a situation here\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkayyy\u201d Harry said confused \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe have a Mr Daniel Watts here, trying to to pick Oli up, we haven\u2019t allowed him into the play room, but he\u2019s refusing to leave\u201d </p><p>\u201cShit\u201d he said with a sense of urgency in his voice \u201che\u2019s Oli\u2019s biological dad, but he we\u2019ve got a court order against him, he\u2019s not allowed any contact\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we thought\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come in and get Oli\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll try and wake him up, thank you Harry\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem, see you soon\u201d he hung up the phone and quickly walked back to the studio to get his things. </p><p>\u201cI have to go\u201d he said darkly, unable to focus on anything else. He trusted the nursery to keep Oli safe, but he didn\u2019t trust Danny to leave before he got his way. The car was parked in a side street a block away but the nursery was a block away in the other direction, so he lifted his hoodie up over his head and began jogging toward his sons school. At this point, he was glad that he\u2019d been training hard in the gym, and as the nursery appeared in view he slowed down to a walk, composing himself before he walked him. </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d Clara said with a smile on her face \u201cthank you for coming on such short notice\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem\u201d he smiled back </p><p>\u201cMr Watts is in my office if you\u2019d like to speak to him.\u201d </p><p>Harry could tell by the tone of her voice that she needed the extra help to try and get him to leave. </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d he followed her into the office, thinking that it would be best to talk to him without Oli around. </p><p>\u201cHarry\u201d Danny said, taking a step toward him </p><p>\u201cMr Watts\u201d Harry said, reaching out to shake his hand, meeting his eyes with a sharp stare \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up my son\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your son until he\u2019s two and you file for parental rights again, and I don\u2019t believe this little incident will look good on your record, and trust me\u201d Harry smirked \u201cit will be on your record, because as soon as I get Oli home I\u2019ll be calling my lawyers\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnce he turns two they\u2019ll have no choice but to grant me parental rights\u201d Danny added in a snarky tone </p><p>\u201cMr Watts,\u201d Clara interpreted the two of them, aware of the commotion it was causing \u201csince Mr Styles here has made it clear that you are not legally allowed contact with Oliver, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave the premises\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going until I see my son\u201d Danny stood his ground. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll have to call the police then\u201d she picked up the phone and dialled the number of the local police, watching as Danny remained still in his place. Harry shook his head at the idiocy Danny was displaying, but remained quietly hopeful that it would mean that He would be able to officially adopt Oli sooner than he thought.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on their way to escort you off the premises\u201d Clara said hanging up the phone and walked towards the door, ushering Harry out as she left Danny standing frozen in his spot. </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry said as she closed the door behind her </p><p>\u201cNo problem Harry\u201d she smiled and rested her hand on his shoulder \u201cit\u2019s my job, you go get your son\u201d </p><p>He nodded \u201cI\u2019ll stick around until the police get here, in case he causes anymore trouble\u201d he smirked \u201cand so I can watch him get escorted away\u201d </p><p>She laughed \u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted, they said they\u2019d only be about five minutes\u201d </p><p>Harry nodded and turned and walked into the babies room to find Margaret and Sarah gathered around the door, trying to eavesdrop on what was going on. </p><p>\u201cHello ladies\u201d Harry said, cheeky smile spread across his face </p><p>\u201cHi Harry\u201d Margaret said \u201ceverything ok out there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep, police are on their way to escort him away from the area\u201d </p><p>\u201cPolice!?\u201d Thats intense\u201d Sarah said, sounding concerned </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s refusing to leave\u201d Harry shrugged \u201cnot the best idea if you ask me, our court order runs out when ol turns two and he can file again, but with attempted kidnaping to his name that\u2019s not going to end well.\u201d Now that he knew that Oli was safe, Harry found the whole situation quite funny. </p><p>\u201cOli\u2019s better off with you, we can all testify to that\u201d Margaret said </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d Harry smiled \u201cwhere is the little man?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBonnie\u2019s still trying to wake up\u201d Sarah gestured towards the room where he was still sleeping soundly. </p><p>\u201cCan I go into the cot room?\u201d Harry asked </p><p>Margaret checked the chart outside the door \u201cOf course, but there\u2019s a few others in there, so keep it down, we need them to sleep longer\u201d she smiled </p><p>Harry slid the door open and saw Bonnie gently trying to wake Oliver from his sleep. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hard to wake\u201d Harry said softly, walking towards his cot \u201cOli,\u201d he cooed \u201cdaddy\u2019s here to take you home\u201d</p><p>He stirred slightly at the sound of Harry\u2019s voice, but remained asleep. Not wanting to miss Danny being escorted away, Harry took down the side of the cot and gently lifted him up into his arms, allowing him to rest his head on his shoulder and remain asleep.</p><p>\u201cIs he back tomorrow?\u201d Bonnie asked before she took the sheets from his bed </p><p>\u201cNormally yes\u201d Harry said softly \u201cbut I think I\u2019ll take tomorrow off keep him home\u201d</p><p>Bonnie nodded and stripped the bed, handing the sheets to Harry \u201cI\u2019ll give you these then\u201d she smiled and lead Harry out of the room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep him home tomorrow\u201d Harry said to Margaret, who was the room leader, as he walked out, and she nodded at him. </p><p>\u201cGood idea, we\u2019ll see you next week then\u201d Margaret said and handed Harry Oli\u2019s bag \u201cenjoy watching him get escorted out\u201d she laughed </p><p>\u201cOh I will\u201d he laughed quietly, aware that Oli was still sleeping on his shoulder. </p><p>Harry walked out of the babies room as the Police were being greeted by Clara. </p><p>\u201cHow long has he been here?\u201d one of the officers asked, taking his notepad out. </p><p>\u201cOnly about half an hour, he came in and went straight into our under two\u2019s room, and asked to pick up one of the children\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd what did your staff do at that point? - We need this information in case the parents of the child want to take him to court.\u201d the officer had already taken down some notes and Harry stood in the corner watching on, subtly taking a seat in one of the arm chairs and searching through Oli\u2019s bag, making sure itchy was in there. </p><p>\u201cThey asked him to stay in the locker room away from the children, and checked our files to see if he was on the contact list for the child, when he wasn\u2019t, he was asked to leave, and we contacted his legal guardian\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect\u201d the officer said \u201cso the parents are aware of this happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes\u201d clara nodded \u201cMr Styles, his legal guardian, is here now to collect him\u201d </p><p>\u201cHello\u201d Harry interrupted, standing up from his chair. </p><p>\u201cOh Harry\u201d Clara laughed \u201cI didn\u2019t see you come out of there- little angel still sleeping?\u201d she smiled at Oli who was snoring on Harry\u2019s shoulder </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s impossible to wake\u201d Harry smiled </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d the officer said \u201cOfficer Bentley\u201d he held out his hand and Harry shook it , \u201cyou mind if I ask a few questions about the court order you and your wife have against Mr Watts?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d Harry shifted Oli gently in his arms </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt\u201d Clara said before the officer had a chance to take ask harry a question \u201cbut do you mind if we take this into the staff room, we quite often get parents coming to pick their children up around this time, and I\u2019d like to make sure Harry has as much privacy with all of this as possible\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou lead the way\u201d Officer Bentley smiled, closing his notepad. Clara led them both down the hallway into a room filled with sofas and a large white table where Harry sat across from the officer, shifting Oli so that he could sleep on Harry\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cAll the staff have had their breaks, so you won\u2019t be interrupted\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d Harry smiled </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you want this on record Mr Styles?\u201d Bentley said as Clara closed the door behind her. </p><p>\u201cI would, yes\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d he nodded and took out his notepad again \u201cbecause he never left the premises with your child, we can\u2019t press any charges, but we can make record of it\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Harry said, trying to keep his voice down </p><p>\u201cMy colleague is talking to Mr Watts briefly before we escort him away, but I\u2019d just like to get some information from you about the court order, so could you tell what that says about your relationship to, Oliver?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUntil he\u2019s two I\u2019m his step father, I have parental responsibility and myself and my wife have full custody\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd what happens when he turns two?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Watts is able to file for parental responsibility, and if a judge can see that he has improved his situation it will be granted, if he doesn\u2019t file, or his request is denied, then I am able to adopt him\u201d </p><p>Bentley took notes as Harry spoke \u201cand how old is oliver now?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201c18 months\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd does the court order say anything about visitation within those two years?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not allowed any contact\u201d Harry said flatly and officer bentley drew his lips into a sharp line. </p><p>\u201cWell unfortunately, because the staff here have done such a good job at keeping your son safe, he\u2019s not technically in violation of the order because no contact was made, but the attempt will be noted and brought to the attention of the judge when and if he files in the next six months\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Harry said \u201cThanks for your help\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy pleasure Mr Styles\u201d he smiled at Harry and stood up \u201cNow, would you like the pleasure of watching him escorted off the premises?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely\u201d Harry said, with a cheeky grin spreading across his face and he stood up, again careful not to wake Oli. Bentley lead harry from the staff room and into the main foyer where his colleague was standing with Danny, holding on tightly to his arm. </p><p> \u201cMr Watts\u201d Bentley said \u201cWe\u2019re going to go now, and you\u2019re not going to make a fuss or we will arrest you for being on private property\u201d </p><p>Oli stirred in Harry\u2019s arms, blinking his eyes open while Harry watched Danny shrug his shoulders and walk quietly out of the centre, with both officers holding onto him. </p><p>\u201cHi little man\u201d Harry cooed quietly so that Danny wouldn\u2019t hear him and cause a scene realising that Oli was awake. Oli lifted his had from Harry\u2019s chest and looked around the room, waking up a little confused and Harry shifted him onto his hip so that he could see what was happening around him. </p><p>\u201cOli wave bye bye?\u201d Harry asked in a soothing tone, waving his hand to show Oli what to do. </p><p>\u201cBye Bye\u201d Oli said softly, waving his hand at Danny. </p>",

He trusted the nursery to keep Oli safe, but he didn\u2019t trust Danny to leave before he got his way. The car was parked in a side street a block away but the nursery was a block away in the other direction, so he lifted his hoodie up over his head and began jogging toward his sons school. At this point, he was glad that he\u2019d been training hard in the gym, and as the nursery appeared in view he slowed down to a walk, composing himself before he walked him. </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d Clara said with a smile on her face \u201cthank you for coming on such short notice\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo problem\u201d he smiled back </p><p>\u201cMr Watts is in my office if you\u2019d like to speak to him.\u201d </p><p>Harry could tell by the tone of her voice that she needed the extra help to try and get him to leave. </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d he followed her into the office, thinking that it would be best to talk to him without Oli around. </p><p>\u201cHarry\u201d Danny said, taking a step toward him </p><p>\u201cMr Watts\u201d Harry said, reaching out to shake his hand, meeting his eyes with a sharp stare \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up my son\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your son until he\u2019s two and you file for parental rights again, and I don\u2019t believe this little incident will look good on your record, and trust me\u201d Harry smirked \u201cit will be on your record, because as soon as I get Oli home I\u2019ll be calling my lawyers\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnce he turns two they\u2019ll have no choice but to grant me parental rights\u201d Danny added in a snarky tone </p><p>\u201cMr Watts,\u201d Clara interpreted the two of them, aware of the commotion it was causing \u201csince Mr Styles here has made it clear that you are not legally allowed contact with Oliver, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave the premises\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going until I see my son\u201d Danny stood his ground. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll have to call the police then\u201d she picked up the phone and dialled the number of the local police, watching as Danny remained still in his place. Harry shook his head at the idiocy Danny was displaying, but remained quietly hopeful that it would mean that He would be able to officially adopt Oli sooner than he thought.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on their way to escort you off the premises\u201d Clara said hanging up the phone and walked towards the door, ushering Harry out as she left Danny standing frozen in his spot. </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry said as she closed the door behind her </p><p>\u201cNo problem Harry\u201d she smiled and rested her hand on his shoulder \u201cit\u2019s my job, you go get your son\u201d </p><p>He nodded \u201cI\u2019ll stick around until the police get here, in case he causes anymore trouble\u201d he smirked \u201cand so I can watch him get escorted away\u201d </p><p>She laughed \u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted, they said they\u2019d only be about five minutes\u201d </p><p>Harry nodded and turned and walked into the babies room to find Margaret and Sarah gathered around the door, trying to eavesdrop on what was going on. </p><p>\u201cHello ladies\u201d Harry said, cheeky smile spread across his face </p><p>\u201cHi Harry\u201d Margaret said \u201ceverything ok out there?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep, police are on their way to escort him away from the area\u201d </p><p>\u201cPolice!?\u201d Thats intense\u201d Sarah said, sounding concerned </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s refusing to leave\u201d Harry shrugged \u201cnot the best idea if you ask me, our court order runs out when ol turns two and he can file again, but with attempted kidnaping to his name that\u2019s not going to end well.\u201d Now that he knew that Oli was safe, Harry found the whole situation quite funny. </p><p>\u201cOli\u2019s better off with you, we can all testify to that\u201d Margaret said </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d Harry smiled \u201cwhere is the little man?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBonnie\u2019s still trying to wake up\u201d Sarah gestured towards the room where he was still sleeping soundly. </p><p>\u201cCan I go into the cot room?\u201d Harry asked </p><p>Margaret checked the chart outside the door \u201cOf course, but there\u2019s a few others in there, so keep it down, we need them to sleep longer\u201d she smiled </p><p>Harry slid the door open and saw Bonnie gently trying to wake Oliver from his sleep. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hard to wake\u201d Harry said softly, walking towards his cot \u201cOli,\u201d he cooed \u201cdaddy\u2019s here to take you home\u201d</p><p>He stirred slightly at the sound of Harry\u2019s voice, but remained asleep. Not wanting to miss Danny being escorted away, Harry took down the side of the cot and gently lifted him up into his arms, allowing him to rest his head on his shoulder and remain asleep.</p><p>\u201cIs he back tomorrow?\u201d Bonnie asked before she took the sheets from his bed </p><p>\u201cNormally yes\u201d Harry said softly \u201cbut I think I\u2019ll take tomorrow off keep him home\u201d</p><p>Bonnie nodded and stripped the bed, handing the sheets to Harry \u201cI\u2019ll give you these then\u201d she smiled and lead Harry out of the room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep him home tomorrow\u201d Harry said to Margaret, who was the room leader, as he walked out, and she nodded at him. </p><p>\u201cGood idea, we\u2019ll see you next week then\u201d Margaret said and handed Harry Oli\u2019s bag \u201cenjoy watching him get escorted out\u201d she laughed </p><p>\u201cOh I will\u201d he laughed quietly, aware that Oli was still sleeping on his shoulder. </p><p>Harry walked out of the babies room as the Police were being greeted by Clara. </p><p>\u201cHow long has he been here?\u201d one of the officers asked, taking his notepad out. </p><p>\u201cOnly about half an hour, he came in and went straight into our under two\u2019s room, and asked to pick up one of the children\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd what did your staff do at that point? - We need this information in case the parents of the child want to take him to court.\u201d the officer had already taken down some notes and Harry stood in the corner watching on, subtly taking a seat in one of the arm chairs and searching through Oli\u2019s bag, making sure itchy was in there. </p><p>\u201cThey asked him to stay in the locker room away from the children, and checked our files to see if he was on the contact list for the child, when he wasn\u2019t, he was asked to leave, and we contacted his legal guardian\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerfect\u201d the officer said \u201cso the parents are aware of this happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes\u201d clara nodded \u201cMr Styles, his legal guardian, is here now to collect him\u201d </p><p>\u201cHello\u201d Harry interrupted, standing up from his chair. </p><p>\u201cOh Harry\u201d Clara laughed \u201cI didn\u2019t see you come out of there- little angel still sleeping?\u201d she smiled at Oli who was snoring on Harry\u2019s shoulder </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s impossible to wake\u201d Harry smiled </p><p>\u201cMr Styles\u201d the officer said \u201cOfficer Bentley\u201d he held out his hand and Harry shook it , \u201cyou mind if I ask a few questions about the court order you and your wife have against Mr Watts?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d Harry shifted Oli gently in his arms </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt\u201d Clara said before the officer had a chance to take ask harry a question \u201cbut do you mind if we take this into the staff room, we quite often get parents coming to pick their children up around this time, and I\u2019d like to make sure Harry has as much privacy with all of this as possible\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou lead the way\u201d Officer Bentley smiled, closing his notepad. Clara led them both down the hallway into a room filled with sofas and a large white table where Harry sat across from the officer, shifting Oli so that he could sleep on Harry\u2019s chest. </p><p>\u201cAll the staff have had their breaks, so you won\u2019t be interrupted\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d Harry smiled </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you want this on record Mr Styles?\u201d Bentley said as Clara closed the door behind her. </p><p>\u201cI would, yes\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright\u201d he nodded and took out his notepad again \u201cbecause he never left the premises with your child, we can\u2019t press any charges, but we can make record of it\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Harry said, trying to keep his voice down </p><p>\u201cMy colleague is talking to Mr Watts briefly before we escort him away, but I\u2019d just like to get some information from you about the court order, so could you tell what that says about your relationship to, Oliver?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUntil he\u2019s two I\u2019m his step father, I have parental responsibility and myself and my wife have full custody\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd what happens when he turns two?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMr Watts is able to file for parental responsibility, and if a judge can see that he has improved his situation it will be granted, if he doesn\u2019t file, or his request is denied, then I am able to adopt him\u201d </p><p>Bentley took notes as Harry spoke \u201cand how old is oliver now?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201c18 months\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd does the court order say anything about visitation within those two years?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not allowed any contact\u201d Harry said flatly and officer bentley drew his lips into a sharp line. </p><p>\u201cWell unfortunately, because the staff here have done such a good job at keeping your son safe, he\u2019s not technically in violation of the order because no contact was made, but the attempt will be noted and brought to the attention of the judge when and if he files in the next six months\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Harry said \u201cThanks for your help\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy pleasure Mr Styles\u201d he smiled at Harry and stood up \u201cNow, would you like the pleasure of watching him escorted off the premises?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely\u201d Harry said, with a cheeky grin spreading across his face and he stood up, again careful not to wake Oli.

At this point, he was glad that he&rsquo;d been training hard in the gym, and as the nursery appeared in view he slowed down to a walk, composing himself before he walked him. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Styles&rdquo; Clara said with a smile on her face &ldquo;thank you for coming on such short notice&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No problem&rdquo; he smiled back </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Watts is in my office if you&rsquo;d like to speak to him.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry could tell by the tone of her voice that she needed the extra help to try and get him to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course&rdquo; he followed her into the office, thinking that it would be best to talk to him without Oli around. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rdquo; Danny said, taking a step toward him </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Watts&rdquo; Harry said, reaching out to shake his hand, meeting his eyes with a sharp stare &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to pick up my son&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not your son until he&rsquo;s two and you file for parental rights again, and I don&rsquo;t believe this little incident will look good on your record, and trust me&rdquo; Harry smirked &ldquo;it will be on your record, because as soon as I get Oli home I&rsquo;ll be calling my lawyers&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Once he turns two they&rsquo;ll have no choice but to grant me parental rights&rdquo; Danny added in a snarky tone </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Watts,&rdquo; Clara interpreted the two of them, aware of the commotion it was causing &ldquo;since Mr Styles here has made it clear that you are not legally allowed contact with Oliver, I&rsquo;m going to have to ask you to leave the premises&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going until I see my son&rdquo; Danny stood his ground. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll have to call the police then&rdquo; she picked up the phone and dialled the number of the local police, watching as Danny remained still in his place. Harry shook his head at the idiocy Danny was displaying, but remained quietly hopeful that it would mean that He would be able to officially adopt Oli sooner than he thought.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on their way to escort you off the premises&rdquo; Clara said hanging up the phone and walked towards the door, ushering Harry out as she left Danny standing frozen in his spot. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Harry said as she closed the door behind her </p><p>&ldquo;No problem Harry&rdquo; she smiled and rested her hand on his shoulder &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my job, you go get your son&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick around until the police get here, in case he causes anymore trouble&rdquo; he smirked &ldquo;and so I can watch him get escorted away&rdquo; </p><p>She laughed &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you posted, they said they&rsquo;d only be about five minutes&rdquo; </p><p>Harry nodded and turned and walked into the babies room to find Margaret and Sarah gathered around the door, trying to eavesdrop on what was going on. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello ladies&rdquo; Harry said, cheeky smile spread across his face </p><p>&ldquo;Hi Harry&rdquo; Margaret said &ldquo;everything ok out there?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep, police are on their way to escort him away from the area&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Police!?&rdquo; Thats intense&rdquo; Sarah said, sounding concerned </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s refusing to leave&rdquo; Harry shrugged &ldquo;not the best idea if you ask me, our court order runs out when ol turns two and he can file again, but with attempted kidnaping to his name that&rsquo;s not going to end well.&rdquo; Now that he knew that Oli was safe, Harry found the whole situation quite funny. </p><p>&ldquo;Oli&rsquo;s better off with you, we can all testify to that&rdquo; Margaret said </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; Harry smiled &ldquo;where is the little man?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bonnie&rsquo;s still trying to wake up&rdquo; Sarah gestured towards the room where he was still sleeping soundly. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I go into the cot room?&rdquo; Harry asked </p><p>Margaret checked the chart outside the door &ldquo;Of course, but there&rsquo;s a few others in there, so keep it down, we need them to sleep longer&rdquo; she smiled </p><p>Harry slid the door open and saw Bonnie gently trying to wake Oliver from his sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hard to wake&rdquo; Harry said softly, walking towards his cot &ldquo;Oli,&rdquo; he cooed &ldquo;daddy&rsquo;s here to take you home&rdquo;</p><p>He stirred slightly at the sound of Harry&rsquo;s voice, but remained asleep. Not wanting to miss Danny being escorted away, Harry took down the side of the cot and gently lifted him up into his arms, allowing him to rest his head on his shoulder and remain asleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he back tomorrow?&rdquo; Bonnie asked before she took the sheets from his bed </p><p>&ldquo;Normally yes&rdquo; Harry said softly &ldquo;but I think I&rsquo;ll take tomorrow off keep him home&rdquo;</p><p>Bonnie nodded and stripped the bed, handing the sheets to Harry &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you these then&rdquo; she smiled and lead Harry out of the room. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep him home tomorrow&rdquo; Harry said to Margaret, who was the room leader, as he walked out, and she nodded at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Good idea, we&rsquo;ll see you next week then&rdquo; Margaret said and handed Harry Oli&rsquo;s bag &ldquo;enjoy watching him get escorted out&rdquo; she laughed </p><p>&ldquo;Oh I will&rdquo; he laughed quietly, aware that Oli was still sleeping on his shoulder. </p><p>Harry walked out of the babies room as the Police were being greeted by Clara. </p><p>&ldquo;How long has he been here?&rdquo; one of the officers asked, taking his notepad out. </p><p>&ldquo;Only about half an hour, he came in and went straight into our under two&rsquo;s room, and asked to pick up one of the children&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And what did your staff do at that point? - We need this information in case the parents of the child want to take him to court.&rdquo; the officer had already taken down some notes and Harry stood in the corner watching on, subtly taking a seat in one of the arm chairs and searching through Oli&rsquo;s bag, making sure itchy was in there. </p><p>&ldquo;They asked him to stay in the locker room away from the children, and checked our files to see if he was on the contact list for the child, when he wasn&rsquo;t, he was asked to leave, and we contacted his legal guardian&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; the officer said &ldquo;so the parents are aware of this happening?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; clara nodded &ldquo;Mr Styles, his legal guardian, is here now to collect him&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; Harry interrupted, standing up from his chair. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh Harry&rdquo; Clara laughed &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you come out of there- little angel still sleeping?&rdquo; she smiled at Oli who was snoring on Harry&rsquo;s shoulder </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s impossible to wake&rdquo; Harry smiled </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Styles&rdquo; the officer said &ldquo;Officer Bentley&rdquo; he held out his hand and Harry shook it , &ldquo;you mind if I ask a few questions about the court order you and your wife have against Mr Watts?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course&rdquo; Harry shifted Oli gently in his arms </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt&rdquo; Clara said before the officer had a chance to take ask harry a question &ldquo;but do you mind if we take this into the staff room, we quite often get parents coming to pick their children up around this time, and I&rsquo;d like to make sure Harry has as much privacy with all of this as possible&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You lead the way&rdquo; Officer Bentley smiled, closing his notepad. Clara led them both down the hallway into a room filled with sofas and a large white table where Harry sat across from the officer, shifting Oli so that he could sleep on Harry&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>&ldquo;All the staff have had their breaks, so you won&rsquo;t be interrupted&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; Harry smiled </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming you want this on record Mr Styles?&rdquo; Bentley said as Clara closed the door behind her. </p><p>&ldquo;I would, yes&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright&rdquo; he nodded and took out his notepad again &ldquo;because he never left the premises with your child, we can&rsquo;t press any charges, but we can make record of it&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; Harry said, trying to keep his voice down </p><p>&ldquo;My colleague is talking to Mr Watts briefly before we escort him away, but I&rsquo;d just like to get some information from you about the court order, so could you tell what that says about your relationship to, Oliver?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Until he&rsquo;s two I&rsquo;m his step father, I have parental responsibility and myself and my wife have full custody&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And what happens when he turns two?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Watts is able to file for parental responsibility, and if a judge can see that he has improved his situation it will be granted, if he doesn&rsquo;t file, or his request is denied, then I am able to adopt him&rdquo; </p><p>Bentley took notes as Harry spoke &ldquo;and how old is oliver now?&rdquo; he asked </p><p>&ldquo;18 months&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And does the court order say anything about visitation within those two years?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not allowed any contact&rdquo; Harry said flatly and officer bentley drew his lips into a sharp line. </p><p>&ldquo;Well unfortunately, because the staff here have done such a good job at keeping your son safe, he&rsquo;s not technically in violation of the order because no contact was made, but the attempt will be noted and brought to the attention of the judge when and if he files in the next six months&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; Harry said &ldquo;Thanks for your help&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My pleasure Mr Styles&rdquo; he smiled at Harry and stood up &ldquo;Now, would you like the pleasure of watching him escorted off the premises?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely&rdquo; Harry said, with a cheeky grin spreading across his face and he stood up, again careful not to wake Oli. Bentley lead harry from the staff room and into the main foyer where his colleague was standing with Danny, holding on tightly to his arm. </p><p> &ldquo;Mr Watts&rdquo; Bentley said &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to go now, and you&rsquo;re not going to make a fuss or we will arrest you for being on private property&rdquo; </p><p>Oli stirred in Harry&rsquo;s arms, blinking his eyes open while Harry watched Danny shrug his shoulders and walk quietly out of the centre, with both officers holding onto him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi little man&rdquo; Harry cooed quietly so that Danny wouldn&rsquo;t hear him and cause a scene realising that Oli was awake. Oli lifted his had from Harry&rsquo;s chest and looked around the room, waking up a little confused and Harry shifted him onto his hip so that he could see what was happening around him. </p><p>&ldquo;Oli wave bye bye?&rdquo; Harry asked in a soothing tone, waving his hand to show Oli what to do. </p><p>&ldquo;Bye Bye&rdquo; Oli said softly, waving his hand at Danny. </p>",

He knew that there was a court order that said he couldn&rsquo;t have any contact with Oliver, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the nursery staff would know that. He straightened his shirt and opened the door to the nursery room, to be greeted by an older lady putting things away in the children&rsquo;s bags. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hi Sir&rdquo; she said &ldquo;can I help you?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here to pick up Oliver&rdquo; </p>\n<p>She looked him up and down sternly, &ldquo;Oliver&rsquo;s mum said his dad would be picking him up this afternoon&rdquo; </p>\n<p>A smile spread across Danny&rsquo;s face &ldquo;I&rsquo;m his dad&rdquo; he said proudly </p>\n</p>",

He kept on thinking how he fucked up so bad, knowing he\u2019s all the reason behind this madness. Many hours staring at the ceiling, thinking of a way to fix this problem. </p><p><i>But, he knew, this can\u2019t be fixed by anything.</i></p><p>His show is in 5 hours, and he didn\u2019t went into any soundchecks, meeting or anything related with it. He wasn\u2019t prepared, he\u2019s still on his bed, hugging your pillow with a little bit of scent now. </p><p>He missed you, the way you always giggle whenever he kiss you goodnight, your hugs and touches are all to die for. The arousing scent of your hair were ghosting over his nose as he pressed himself harder at your pillow. </p><p>You left his house the second you exit the venue, you didn\u2019t thought about it, you just made your decision right there. The madness took over you and did the <i>wrong</i> thing. </p><p>His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his phone going off, still wishing it\u2019s Y/N, but he knew, she could never call him again, she blocked him on everything.</p><p>He looked at the caller ID and saw it was Jeff, he groaned, a little bit pissed at him knowing that he was the one who didn\u2019t checked and kept on track on time. After a few rings, Harry finally picked up, not saying anything.</p><p>\u201cHarry, mat\u2014\u201c</p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Mate\u2019 me after what you just did.\u201d</i> He rolled his eyes, his voice were raspy, cracking and deep because of his screams when the minute he knew you left him. He heard him sigh and went silent for a little while. </p><p>\u201cI got this, I\u2019ll explain the truth, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. Despite everything\u2019s that has been happening, he still thought about his fans, he couldn\u2019t cancel them, they paid so hard to get in, and he couldn\u2019t just think about himself. </p><p>-</p><p>Harry sat alone in his dressing room, looking at the ground completely distracted. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you, how you broke down in front of him, and how you explained your feelings towards him. It hurts him. </p><p>\u201cHarry? Come on now, it\u2019s about to start.\u201d Clare\u2019s voice were heard behind the door. He looked at it, unsure if he\u2019s <i>still</i> gonna continue this.</p><p><i>But, he will, for his fans.</i></p><p>Clare looked at him in pity, she knows what happened since Harry always share his stories with her. She wrapped her arm around his waist and gave him a smile, which he returned and put his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d She asked while they\u2019re walking together towards backstage. </p><p>Harry sighed, he didn\u2019t know how to answer or how to answer her question. Even him doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s feeling right now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying my best.\u201d He gave her a reassuring smile. </p><p><i>\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s sing, rockstar.\u201d</i></p><p>-</p><p>The fans\u2019 faces were pure of worries as they noticed that Harry wasn\u2019t smiling or laughing anymore. It bothered him, he want to do the same old things he used to do, but he can\u2019t. He can\u2019t find the motivation to keep him happy or enegerized. </p><p>His dances were minimum, he wasn\u2019t groovy like he used to be. The way he talks to fans were short and simple, he would just place the flag on his mic stand and not wave it around on stage. </p><p><i>\u201cI dedicate this song to a very special person in my life. Please sing it with me, this is sweet creature.\u201d </i>He loved singing it to you whenever you are stressed, busy or tired. It was also your favorite song of his album, so it was special for him.</p><p>He wished that you were there to watch him play, and keep him motivated. </p><p><i>And you were.</i></p><p>Jeff explained everything when you woke up, knowing that he was the one who kept Harry late in the bar. You knew it was his show today, so you didn\u2019t bother showing yourself to him since you asked help from his team to lead you in a hidden place. </p><p>You were still proud at your sight, but also sad seeing him very down, blue and hopeless. You were a crying mess when you heard him singing your favorite song of his, it never grows old whenever he\u2019s singing it. You missed every piece of him, everything about him is being missed by you. </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t run, but walked fastly towards the backstage so he can go back to his dressing room. He stopped his tracks when he smelled a familiar scent of someone, his heart beat was beating too fast when he was realizing who it was. </p><p>He prayed it was <i>you.</i></p><p>And it was. </p><p>He almost dropped his knees at the sight of you, sitting on one of the chairs on the room. Your hair was messy, you wore simple clothes, no make up at all. He loved that kind of Y/N, bare and simple, he couldn\u2019t get tired seeing it everyday. </p><p>\u201cJeff told me.\u201d You whispered. Your voice wasn\u2019t the same old happy and jolly like you used to, and it bothered him. Your voice is his favorite in you. He looked at the ground, not answering anything, but he knew he need to say something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He croaked out. </p><p>He heard you sigh, and stood up from your seat. </p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault anyways.\u201d </i>Harry\u2019s ears lit up from your words, he wanted you to know that it wasn\u2019t his intention to miss your event. </p><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t mean miss your event, I swear to God.\u201d Harry grabbed your hands, he took a shaky breathe as he felt how cold it was. You nodded, looking at the ground. You were still not sure if you could trust him. Breaking his promise is the least thing you wanted him to do, but still, he did it. </p><p>\u201cD\u2019you still love me?\u201d He whispered. </p><p><i>\u201cHow could I love you again, if I don\u2019t even know if I still trust you?\u201d</i></p><p>Your words were like knife stabbing on his chest, he don\u2019t know how or what to answer that. He understands completely how hard it is for you to love him again, and it wasn\u2019t an easy favor for you to do. </p><p><i>You want to love him again. You really want to.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I want you to know that.\u201d His voice were always breaking in every words he says. You sighed finally looking at him, you loved seeing his face, the structures and features of it are keeping you safe and contented.</p><p><i>\u201cI really want to trust you again, I do, but I don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d </i>You finally said, earning a small sigh from him, he looked at his side, blinking away some tears and sniffed a little. You suddenly felt that he\u2019s very sincere in everything he said. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give up on us.\u201d </p><p><i>\u201cWhat if you need to?\u201d</i></p><p>Those 5 words made him drop into his knees, completely defeated by it. You gasped into his actions and quickly kneeled beside him, you went over to grab his hands, and gave him some reassuring words. </p><p><i>\u201cFuck, couldn\u2019t even see myself saying that to you.\u201d</i></p><p>Your eyes teared up a bit, at the view you were seeing. You just want to see his daily smile whenever you spend some time with him, you want this fight to end. </p><p><i>\u201cJust don\u2019t state promises that you can\u2019t keep.\u201d</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s heart started to beat fast as he looked at you. His hands were shaking, he would do anything for him to fix this problem. </p><p>You both were silent for a while, until you let out a smile, Harry was about to return it, but it was replaced by a bigger one once he saw you opening your arms, it was a sign that he knows that you guys are finally okay. </p><p>You laughed as he crashed his body into yours, his hold was completely tight, but he still tried to keep it comfortable for you. You didn\u2019t bother anything, you want to bring him back into your life, you love him. </p><p>\u201cI love you, so so much.\u201d He murmured against your neck, you felt water were coming down to his cheeks making your heart flutter in happiness. The room was filled with cries, and broken voices, but it\u2019s now replaced by laughters and joy voices. </p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t asked for anything else, he just wants to be with the person he loves and nobody else. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll always be on your side, I promise you.\u201d</i></p>",

He kept on thinking how he fucked up so bad, knowing he\u2019s all the reason behind this madness. Many hours staring at the ceiling, thinking of a way to fix this problem. </p><p><i>But, he knew, this can\u2019t be fixed by anything.</i></p><p>His show is in 5 hours, and he didn\u2019t went into any soundchecks, meeting or anything related with it. He wasn\u2019t prepared, he\u2019s still on his bed, hugging your pillow with a little bit of scent now. </p><p>He missed you, the way you always giggle whenever he kiss you goodnight, your hugs and touches are all to die for. The arousing scent of your hair were ghosting over his nose as he pressed himself harder at your pillow. </p><p>You left his house the second you exit the venue, you didn\u2019t thought about it, you just made your decision right there. The madness took over you and did the <i>wrong</i> thing. </p><p>His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his phone going off, still wishing it\u2019s Y/N, but he knew, she could never call him again, she blocked him on everything.</p><p>He looked at the caller ID and saw it was Jeff, he groaned, a little bit pissed at him knowing that he was the one who didn\u2019t checked and kept on track on time. After a few rings, Harry finally picked up, not saying anything.</p><p>\u201cHarry, mat\u2014\u201c</p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Mate\u2019 me after what you just did.\u201d</i> He rolled his eyes, his voice were raspy, cracking and deep because of his screams when the minute he knew you left him. He heard him sigh and went silent for a little while. </p><p>\u201cI got this, I\u2019ll explain the truth, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. Despite everything\u2019s that has been happening, he still thought about his fans, he couldn\u2019t cancel them, they paid so hard to get in, and he couldn\u2019t just think about himself. </p><p>-</p><p>Harry sat alone in his dressing room, looking at the ground completely distracted. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you, how you broke down in front of him, and how you explained your feelings towards him. It hurts him. </p><p>\u201cHarry? Come on now, it\u2019s about to start.\u201d Clare\u2019s voice were heard behind the door. He looked at it, unsure if he\u2019s <i>still</i> gonna continue this.</p><p><i>But, he will, for his fans.</i></p><p>Clare looked at him in pity, she knows what happened since Harry always share his stories with her. She wrapped her arm around his waist and gave him a smile, which he returned and put his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d She asked while they\u2019re walking together towards backstage. </p><p>Harry sighed, he didn\u2019t know how to answer or how to answer her question. Even him doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s feeling right now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying my best.\u201d He gave her a reassuring smile. </p><p><i>\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s sing, rockstar.\u201d</i></p><p>-</p><p>The fans\u2019 faces were pure of worries as they noticed that Harry wasn\u2019t smiling or laughing anymore. It bothered him, he want to do the same old things he used to do, but he can\u2019t. He can\u2019t find the motivation to keep him happy or enegerized. </p><p>His dances were minimum, he wasn\u2019t groovy like he used to be. The way he talks to fans were short and simple, he would just place the flag on his mic stand and not wave it around on stage. </p><p><i>\u201cI dedicate this song to a very special person in my life. Please sing it with me, this is sweet creature.\u201d </i>He loved singing it to you whenever you are stressed, busy or tired. It was also your favorite song of his album, so it was special for him.</p><p>He wished that you were there to watch him play, and keep him motivated. </p><p><i>And you were.</i></p><p>Jeff explained everything when you woke up, knowing that he was the one who kept Harry late in the bar. You knew it was his show today, so you didn\u2019t bother showing yourself to him since you asked help from his team to lead you in a hidden place. </p><p>You were still proud at your sight, but also sad seeing him very down, blue and hopeless. You were a crying mess when you heard him singing your favorite song of his, it never grows old whenever he\u2019s singing it. You missed every piece of him, everything about him is being missed by you. </p><p>Harry didn\u2019t run, but walked fastly towards the backstage so he can go back to his dressing room. He stopped his tracks when he smelled a familiar scent of someone, his heart beat was beating too fast when he was realizing who it was. </p><p>He prayed it was <i>you.</i></p><p>And it was. </p><p>He almost dropped his knees at the sight of you, sitting on one of the chairs on the room. Your hair was messy, you wore simple clothes, no make up at all. He loved that kind of Y/N, bare and simple, he couldn\u2019t get tired seeing it everyday. </p><p>\u201cJeff told me.\u201d You whispered. Your voice wasn\u2019t the same old happy and jolly like you used to, and it bothered him. Your voice is his favorite in you. He looked at the ground, not answering anything, but he knew he need to say something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He croaked out. </p><p>He heard you sigh, and stood up from your seat. </p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault anyways.\u201d </i>Harry\u2019s ears lit up from your words, he wanted you to know that it wasn\u2019t his intention to miss your event. </p><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t mean miss your event, I swear to God.\u201d Harry grabbed your hands, he took a shaky breathe as he felt how cold it was. You nodded, looking at the ground. You were still not sure if you could trust him. Breaking his promise is the least thing you wanted him to do, but still, he did it. </p><p>\u201cD\u2019you still love me?\u201d He whispered. </p><p><i>\u201cHow could I love you again, if I don\u2019t even know if I still trust you?\u201d</i></p><p>Your words were like knife stabbing on his chest, he don\u2019t know how or what to answer that. He understands completely how hard it is for you to love him again, and it wasn\u2019t an easy favor for you to do. </p><p><i>You want to love him again. You really want to.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I want you to know that.\u201d His voice were always breaking in every words he says. You sighed finally looking at him, you loved seeing his face, the structures and features of it are keeping you safe and contented.</p><p><i>\u201cI really want to trust you again, I do, but I don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t know what to believe.\u201d </i>You finally said, earning a small sigh from him, he looked at his side, blinking away some tears and sniffed a little. You suddenly felt that he\u2019s very sincere in everything he said. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to give up on us.\u201d </p><p><i>\u201cWhat if you need to?\u201d</i></p><p>Those 5 words made him drop into his knees, completely defeated by it. You gasped into his actions and quickly kneeled beside him, you went over to grab his hands, and gave him some reassuring words. </p><p><i>\u201cFuck, couldn\u2019t even see myself saying that to you.\u201d</i></p><p>Your eyes teared up a bit, at the view you were seeing. You just want to see his daily smile whenever you spend some time with him, you want this fight to end. </p><p><i>\u201cJust don\u2019t state promises that you can\u2019t keep.\u201d</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s heart started to beat fast as he looked at you. His hands were shaking, he would do anything for him to fix this problem. </p><p>You both were silent for a while, until you let out a smile, Harry was about to return it, but it was replaced by a bigger one once he saw you opening your arms, it was a sign that he knows that you guys are finally okay. </p><p>You laughed as he crashed his body into yours, his hold was completely tight, but he still tried to keep it comfortable for you. You didn\u2019t bother anything, you want to bring him back into your life, you love him. </p><p>\u201cI love you, so so much.\u201d He murmured against your neck, you felt water were coming down to his cheeks making your heart flutter in happiness. The room was filled with cries, and broken voices, but it\u2019s now replaced by laughters and joy voices. </p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t asked for anything else, he just wants to be with the person he loves and nobody else. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll always be on your side, I promise you.\u201d</i></p></p>",
