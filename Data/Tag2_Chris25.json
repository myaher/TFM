Over that few day course, Bucky had made the decision to temporarily go back on the ice until the technicians could figure out how to stop his Russian mind control problem.<br/></p><p>They said it would probably only be a few weeks at most, as they were highly advanced in the medical and technological field. He just wanted to be sure he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone until they could figure it out. He knew what he was like when he wasn\u2019t in control.\n</p><p>After he went under, Steve and you had devised a plan to break everyone out of the prison. Sharon Carter had given him the whereabouts of the floating Alcatraz and soon you guys arranged how you were going to do it.\n</p><p>You would pilot the ship, hovering it over the sea and he would swim out to the imprisonment. Simultaneously you would use your tech wiz skills to knock out the security so he could not only get in, but get himself and several others out.  \n</p><p>You would then stall the lockdown alert from getting to the mainland security just in time for you guys to get far away from the scene in order to keep them from tracking you.\n</p><p>It was the perfect plan and you were ready to help your captain at all costs, especially if it meant getting your team back. They were the closest thing you had to a family, and soon you would all be back together. \n</p><p>Suiting up was a lot more fun, Shurri and her tech crew had amped up the wow factor a little bit by adding micro tech and vibranium in your suit. It was cool to see it practically slither around your body. The normal silver metal was lined with glowing purple as it shined through the cracks. The arc reactor also had a purple glow to it now.\n</p><p>Looking across the room, Steve had strapped his gloves on, nodding to you to signify he was ready to go. \n</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d he asked you, you nodding as soon as he did.\n</p><p>\u201cBorn ready.\u201d \n</p><p>You saw the familiar smirk form on his face at the phrase. You both stood up, collecting your things before heading down to the quinjet. T\u2019challa stood there, holding two small devices in his hand, they looked almost like compasses but you couldn\u2019t be sure.\n</p><p>\u201cCaptain. I have something for you and the iron maiden.\u201d He glanced in your direction at the last part, making you blush from the nickname. He then placed the small devices in both of your hands, even you were not sure what they were.\n</p><p>\u201cThese are homing beacons. If you press that button, we can track you and find you if you\u2019re in need of help. You may not need them, but just in case.\u201d \n</p><p>You were so entranced in the small thing, you almost ignored what he said.\n</p><p>\u201cThank you T\u2019challa, for everything. What you\u2019ve done will always make me an ally.\u201d Steve finished as he shook the young king\u2019s hand. \n</p><p>\u201cAs long as you are an ally, Barnes will be well taken care of.\u201d He smiled, before turning to you. You had become quite fond of him the last few days, as you&rsquo;d spent some time conversing over the amazing technology of the place. \n</p><p>\u201cAnd as for you, miss iron girl\u2026 you are welcome here anytime you wish to stay.\u201d He smiled warmly before crossing his arms over his chest in an x shape, nodding to you both before he walked away.\n</p><p>You and Steve climbed aboard the transport, not even giving a second glance back when you closed the ramp. Taking your seat next to him you buckled yourself in, feeling the right straps hold you in place. You glanced up to your left, eyes meeting his with a smirk.\n</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get em\u2019 Cap.\u201d \n</p><p>-\n</p><p>Later that evening everyone was huddled together inside the quinjet, which you guys had chosen to land in the mountains so no one could find you. You were careful not to let anyone or anything track you after you successfully accomplished the rescue.\n</p><p>They were all a bit shaken up, but now that you\u2019d gotten them back they were okay. \n</p><p>Wanda hadn&rsquo;t really talked all night, but you figured you could change that pretty easily. You went over and sat by her. You opened your mouth to speak but she beat you to it.\n</p><p>\u201cY/n, I know that we are free. But they\u2019re still going to be after us. They will chase us down if they have to. Your father is going to enforce that by any means,\u201d she paused to rethink what she was about to say. \u201cI think that maybe all of us should split up. Make it harder for them to get us.\u201d \n</p><p>When she finished you knew where she was coming from, and in all sense it really would have been the smart thing to do, but it would take a lot of convincing for Steve to let it happen. He always wanted everyone to stick together. \n</p><p>Contemplating her words, and figuring out a way to make the plan possible, you nodded your head to her. She looked down at her hands then back up to you.\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say we should leave each other right away. This would take some planning. I do have an idea though of where we can hide before we figure everything out.\u201d \n</p><p>You turned your head, now intrigued at the place she had in mind. Knowing her it would be a safe place to possibly stay the week in. Maybe even longer, if needed be.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Steve.\u201d You nodded towards her and She gave you a smirk.\n</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with Steve?\u201d she chided, knowing full well of the \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 you two had been blooming over the years.\n</p><p>\u201cThey're\u2026. Going.\u201d You cut short, not wanting to go into full detail about your love confession right now. She just rolled her eyes and shrugged, not forcing you to speak about it any further.\n</p><p>\u201cThe place is a bunker not far from here,\u201d she spoke up again, changing the subject as quick as she could. \u201cWe could probably make it there by nightfall.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cYou think you could fly the ship there?\u201d You asked softly, slinking back in your seat as you spoke.\n</p><p>\u201cYes. But we\u2019d have to get moving.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that then.\u201d \n</p><p>You stood up from you seat and over to Steve where Wanda watched you speak with him about the matter. She saw him look at you with a stern look before relaxing a bit and nodding his head. He turned to look at Maximoff, nodding his head at her too, giving her the signal that it was okay to fly the ship to a new place. She stood up and smiled, walking to the front of the transport and using her powers to get everything started up.\n</p><p>The flight wasn&rsquo;t long, even shorter than she had said it would be, and you all touched down before the sun set completely.\n</p><p>Outside was a small motel, no more than 20 rooms possibly, but it was low key and would for sure keep you guys hidden and safe from the public for the time being. You all unloaded and Sam went in and got rooms for everyone.\n</p><p>He came out about a minute later, holding key cards in his hands. \n</p><p>\u201cI could only get 3 rooms. Some of us are gonna have to bunk up.\u201d He said passing them around.\n</p><p>\u201cI can go with Scott.\u201d Clint took one of the key cards, heading in the direction of the rooms to put his stuff down.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with Wanda.\u201d You said, heading in the same direction as Clint with Wanda following close behind. \n</p><p>\u201cGuess you&rsquo;re stuck with me cap.\u201d Sam smirked and elbowed Steve in the arm making him chuckle.\n</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d \n</p><p>They soon followed suit of the rest of you, heading into their rooms as well. Each room had two queen sized beds, although the quality wasn&rsquo;t the greatest, you were okay to be there as long as it was a safe roof over your heads. \n</p><p>As the time passed the next day, you made sure to tell Steve about Wanda\u2019s plan to split up. He though it was genuinely a good idea as you would need to keep a low profile and traveling in a big group would draw attention.\n</p><p>To your surprise, someone came knocking on your door later in the afternoon. It was Natasha. You welcomed her with warm open arms as you knew she wasn\u2019t there to take any of you guys in. Steve had told you what she did for the team, so everyone was happy to welcome not only her but Vision into the group. He followed along because he didn\u2019t want to be away from Wanda in case anything happened. \n</p><p>Steve was almost worried about it but then later that night something happened that he did not expect. A phone call. A phone call from a number that belonged to the flip phone he had sent Tony in a the mail a few days prior. \n</p><p>He hesitantly picked it up, answering it as best he could. Tony immediately started talking.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve. I didn\u2019t think I would do this, but I know she&rsquo;s with you. How is she?\u201d he asked, speeding out his words with a wavering voice. \n</p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s fine, she&rsquo;s been warn out but she\u2019s fine.\u201d He replied, sitting down on the edge of the bed. Sam was in the shower at the time so Steve didn\u2019t have to worry about having him eavesdropping. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere are you guys?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cTony you know I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d \n</p><p>Tony heaved a heavy breath before sighing at those words.\n</p><p>\u201cI deserve to know where my daughter is Rogers. I can\u2019t be sure she&rsquo;s safe if I don&rsquo;t.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cTony I would never let anything happen to her. Ever. I will keep her safe at all costs.\u201d He was quick to tell him what he would do for you, letting him know his intentions. \n</p><p>\u201cSteve if you&rsquo;re planning to run you can\u2019t bring her with you.\u201d He spoke with a sincere voice, trying to approach the situation calmly.\n</p><p>\u201cTony I told you I won\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cThat might not be your decision cap. If they find you and she\u2019s with you, they won\u2019t hesitate to grab her as soon as you let your guard down. You know that.\u201d In his mind it made sense to bring you with him, but the way Tony put it was the more logical thing that might happen.\n</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose I do then, I can\u2019t just leave her?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re stashing Barnes somewhere, if she stays in one place away from you she won\u2019t get caught. Take her there and make sure she&rsquo;ll be safe.\u201d \n</p><p>Steve covered half his face with his hand, stressed out at the conversation. He is not only worried about you, but also conflicted because he wants to keep you with him. He thought about it for a moment before responding. \n</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cDeal. I\u2019ll put her somewhere safe but you have to promise not to try and find her yourself. I promise you she&rsquo;ll be safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI can promise that.\u201d Tony said before abruptly hang in up the phone. Little did Steve know that was the last time he would talk to Tony for a long time.\n</p><p>Sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands, he had to think about how he was going to tell you. How he was going to leave you. He didn\u2019t want to, he would give anything not to. But he promised Tony he would do it for your safety, and your safety was more important than anything.\n</p><p>As if on cue, he heard crying coming from next door. He was about to stand up and walk out the door but as soon as he did he saw Natasha standing in front of him.\n</p><p>You and her were now bunking up because Vision insisted on staying with Wanda.\n</p><p>She woke up when you started crying and went to get Steve right away.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve she keeps saying your name I figured I should get you.\u201d He nodded and immediately went in to calm you down. Natasha went inside his room and got settled in, figuring that you would want Steve to stay with you tonight.\n</p><p><i>It was dark. There was a single light in the distance. Under the light was a small table with a knife and a note laying on top of it. The knife was covered in blood and when you looked down your hands were too. \n</i></p><p><i>You turned around at a loud sound, it sounded like a gun shot. You saw someone standing in the dark holding the gun, but it was pointed towards you. When you looked down there was a bullet hole right in your abdomen where you\u2019d been shot before. \n</i></p><p><i>The blood dropped down your body and onto your legs. You lost your balance and came crashing to the floor. You struggled to breathe and with all the blood you were losing, you were struggling to stay awake as well.\n</i></p><p><i>That was when you saw him. Steve came rushing to your side, holding you close to him. He had tears dripping down his face as he looked at you. He looked up towards the dark figure in the shadows holding a gun and shouted.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot her, me.\u201d\n</i></p><p><i>You were about to go completely into the darkness when you heard it again. A gunshot even louder than the first one sounded through your head. You suddenly were wide awake and had a surge of strength return to your body. You sat up and turned to the side, seeing Steve now laying instead on the floor, the life slowly draining from him. Bullet hole right in the middle of his chest as he laid there.\n</i></p><p><i>You clung to him as right as you could, lowering your face to kiss his lips once, twice and then tree times. It did nothing, he was still  dying there in your arms.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cSteve please don&rsquo;t leave me. Please don\u2019t leave me I love you Steve please. No.\u201d You cried, but your cries went unanswered, his eyes finally closing and his breath stopping.\n</i></p><p>You were shaken awake by a familiar presence, breathing fast as it all came crashing down. Your teary eyes opened to see Steve sitting next to you and you pulled him close to you, practically squeezing the life out of him as you did. \n</p><p>\u201cShh angel it&rsquo;s okay, I\u2019ve got you doll, I\u2019m here.\u201d He soothed, putting his other hand to the back of our head, cradling you head close to him.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. You&rsquo;re okay.\u201d You began to stop the tears that flowed, slowing your breathing and running your hands up and down his back. \n</p><p>He pulled back from you at arms length, cupping your face with his hand, stroking your cheek with his thumb.\n</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d\n</p><p>You were slightly hesitant at first, but then relaxed a bit, knowing that Steve was here for you and always was. Knowing that he adored you and would help you with this.\n</p><p>\u201cI was back in that room. There was a knife, it had blood on it, my blood. I heard a gunshot and the bullet went through me and I didn\u2019t even know it. You were there. You were with me but then he shot you. I wasn\u2019t hurt anymore but you died.\u201d Your breathing was rapid again, talking about it this time didn\u2019t seem to be helping you.\n</p><p>\u201cDoll I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m here,\u201d he kept trying to calm you down but to no avail, You kept shaking and began crying again. \u201cAngel I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cSteve please promise me you\u2019ll never leave me. I need you. Please promise me Steve.\u201d You could not even start to describe what would happen to you if something happened to him. You didn\u2019t want to think about what you might do to yourself, but it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.\n</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can promise that. Doll I have to tell you something.\u201d He lifted you chin so your eyes met his, tear streaked cheeks and all gazing up at him.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve please tell me whatever it is won\u2019t separate us. I can&rsquo;t do it. Not without you.\u201d You cried harder and harder, trying to contemplate what he was actually trying to say to you.\n</p><p>\u201cAngel it\u2019ll be okay. You are so strong. Tony called me, he thinks it might be a good idea to take you to Wakanda with Bucky. You&rsquo;ll be safe there and-\u201c I \n</p><p>\u201cNo Steve, please don&rsquo;t. Don\u2019t leave me there please. Steve let me come with you.\u201d You were having a full blown panic attack by now, not able to keep a coherent thought except for to try and convince him to stay with you.\n</p><p>\u201cBaby doll I can\u2019t put you in danger. Tony said they&rsquo;d come for you. I\u2019m not risking it, I can\u2019t risk it.\u201d He tried to reason with you but you weren\u2019t having it. You were not letting this one go. Every other time you would sit on the sidelines because Steve insists it was for you safety, but not this time. You weren\u2019t going down this time without a fight. You dried your tears as best you could, trying to make your voice as level as possible.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve no. I\u2019m not going to stay back without you. I need you. And as long as we&rsquo;re together it\u2019s worth the risk. I can handle myself and I want to be there for you.\u201d You spoke with a shaky, yet somewhat composed voice, but he knew how you were feeling on the inside, and this was killing him. \n</p><p>\u201cY/n this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about you.\u201d\n</p><p>His intentions seemed to be only one sided, and you knew just by looking at him that he didn\u2019t want to do this as much as you didn&rsquo;t.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve it is not just about me. What if something happened to you and I wasn\u2019t there. That would haunt me forever. Steve I already have dreams about it. If I wasn\u2019t there I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d You reached up to his face, trying to make him look you in the eye, as before then he\u2019d been looking anywhere but you. \u201cSteve we can\u2019t just split up purely because my dad said something about it to you. For all we know he could have just said that to get you to leave me somewhere so he can come get me himself.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe he would do that?\u201d this time it was you who didn\u2019t want to look him in the eye. Your dad wouldn\u2019t do that to you, not in a million years. He was the one who let you go, to be with Steve and fight with him.\n</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way we can compromise. I don\u2019t want to leave you so I won\u2019t. But here&rsquo;s the deal, wherever we go to hide out, you have to stay unless I\u2019m there with you to go out. And if there\u2019s even one instance where they come after you, then I\u2019m gonna take you to Wakanda.\u201d This was the ultimatum, but fortunately for you, it was a good one and meant you&rsquo;d get to stay with him. \n</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d You sniffled once more, and held your hand out for him to shake, which he did with a soft smile. \n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He let go of your hand and wrapped his arms around your small frame. You tucked your head under his chin with your face buried in his chest. \u201cDo you want me to stay with you tonight?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cIsn&rsquo;t Natasha supposed to be in here?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cNo she switched with me so I could stay with you.\u201d\n</p><p>You nodded your head and laid down, him gently doing the same behind you and bringing his arms around your waist like he did at home. But that wasn\u2019t really your home, neither was anywhere else. You were home right in this moment, with Steve. He was your home and he always would be. \n</p><p>With peace and a now sound mind, you and Steve fell into a quiet slumber.</p><h2>Tags:</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\">@stickyqueenbouquetsstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\">@vxidnik</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\">@oliviaharddyy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\">@sunflowersun0212</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\">@gwynethjodie</a></p>",

Over that few day course, Bucky had made the decision to temporarily go back on the ice until the technicians could figure out how to stop his Russian mind control problem.<br></p><p>They said it would probably only be a few weeks at most, as they were highly advanced in the medical and technological field. He just wanted to be sure he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone until they could figure it out. He knew what he was like when he wasn\u2019t in control.\n</p><p>After he went under, Steve and you had devised a plan to break everyone out of the prison. Sharon Carter had given him the whereabouts of the floating Alcatraz and soon you guys arranged how you were going to do it.\n</p><p>You would pilot the ship, hovering it over the sea and he would swim out to the imprisonment. Simultaneously you would use your tech wiz skills to knock out the security so he could not only get in, but get himself and several others out.  \n</p><p>You would then stall the lockdown alert from getting to the mainland security just in time for you guys to get far away from the scene in order to keep them from tracking you.\n</p><p>It was the perfect plan and you were ready to help your captain at all costs, especially if it meant getting your team back. They were the closest thing you had to a family, and soon you would all be back together. \n</p><p>Suiting up was a lot more fun, Shurri and her tech crew had amped up the wow factor a little bit by adding micro tech and vibranium in your suit. It was cool to see it practically slither around your body. The normal silver metal was lined with glowing purple as it shined through the cracks. The arc reactor also had a purple glow to it now.\n</p><p>Looking across the room, Steve had strapped his gloves on, nodding to you to signify he was ready to go. \n</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d he asked you, you nodding as soon as he did.\n</p><p>\u201cBorn ready.\u201d \n</p><p>You saw the familiar smirk form on his face at the phrase. You both stood up, collecting your things before heading down to the quinjet. T\u2019challa stood there, holding two small devices in his hand, they looked almost like compasses but you couldn\u2019t be sure.\n</p><p>\u201cCaptain. I have something for you and the iron maiden.\u201d He glanced in your direction at the last part, making you blush from the nickname. He then placed the small devices in both of your hands, even you were not sure what they were.\n</p><p>\u201cThese are homing beacons. If you press that button, we can track you and find you if you\u2019re in need of help. You may not need them, but just in case.\u201d \n</p><p>You were so entranced in the small thing, you almost ignored what he said.\n</p><p>\u201cThank you T\u2019challa, for everything. What you\u2019ve done will always make me an ally.\u201d Steve finished as he shook the young king\u2019s hand. \n</p><p>\u201cAs long as you are an ally, Barnes will be well taken care of.\u201d He smiled, before turning to you. You had become quite fond of him the last few days, as you\u2019d spent some time conversing over the amazing technology of the place. \n</p><p>\u201cAnd as for you, miss iron girl\u2026 you are welcome here anytime you wish to stay.\u201d He smiled warmly before crossing his arms over his chest in an x shape, nodding to you both before he walked away.\n</p><p>You and Steve climbed aboard the transport, not even giving a second glance back when you closed the ramp. Taking your seat next to him you buckled yourself in, feeling the right straps hold you in place. You glanced up to your left, eyes meeting his with a smirk.\n</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get em\u2019 Cap.\u201d \n</p><p>-\n</p><p>Later that evening everyone was huddled together inside the quinjet, which you guys had chosen to land in the mountains so no one could find you. You were careful not to let anyone or anything track you after you successfully accomplished the rescue.\n</p><p>They were all a bit shaken up, but now that you\u2019d gotten them back they were okay. \n</p><p>Wanda hadn\u2019t really talked all night, but you figured you could change that pretty easily. You went over and sat by her. You opened your mouth to speak but she beat you to it.\n</p><p>\u201cY/n, I know that we are free. But they\u2019re still going to be after us. They will chase us down if they have to. Your father is going to enforce that by any means,\u201d she paused to rethink what she was about to say. \u201cI think that maybe all of us should split up. Make it harder for them to get us.\u201d \n</p><p>When she finished you knew where she was coming from, and in all sense it really would have been the smart thing to do, but it would take a lot of convincing for Steve to let it happen. He always wanted everyone to stick together. \n</p><p>Contemplating her words, and figuring out a way to make the plan possible, you nodded your head to her. She looked down at her hands then back up to you.\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say we should leave each other right away. This would take some planning. I do have an idea though of where we can hide before we figure everything out.\u201d \n</p><p>You turned your head, now intrigued at the place she had in mind. Knowing her it would be a safe place to possibly stay the week in. Maybe even longer, if needed be.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Steve.\u201d You nodded towards her and She gave you a smirk.\n</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with Steve?\u201d she chided, knowing full well of the \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 you two had been blooming over the years.\n</p><p>\u201cThey're\u2026. Going.\u201d You cut short, not wanting to go into full detail about your love confession right now. She just rolled her eyes and shrugged, not forcing you to speak about it any further.\n</p><p>\u201cThe place is a bunker not far from here,\u201d she spoke up again, changing the subject as quick as she could. \u201cWe could probably make it there by nightfall.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cYou think you could fly the ship there?\u201d You asked softly, slinking back in your seat as you spoke.\n</p><p>\u201cYes. But we\u2019d have to get moving.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that then.\u201d \n</p><p>You stood up from you seat and over to Steve where Wanda watched you speak with him about the matter. She saw him look at you with a stern look before relaxing a bit and nodding his head. He turned to look at Maximoff, nodding his head at her too, giving her the signal that it was okay to fly the ship to a new place. She stood up and smiled, walking to the front of the transport and using her powers to get everything started up.\n</p><p>The flight wasn\u2019t long, even shorter than she had said it would be, and you all touched down before the sun set completely.\n</p><p>Outside was a small motel, no more than 20 rooms possibly, but it was low key and would for sure keep you guys hidden and safe from the public for the time being. You all unloaded and Sam went in and got rooms for everyone.\n</p><p>He came out about a minute later, holding key cards in his hands. \n</p><p>\u201cI could only get 3 rooms. Some of us are gonna have to bunk up.\u201d He said passing them around.\n</p><p>\u201cI can go with Scott.\u201d Clint took one of the key cards, heading in the direction of the rooms to put his stuff down.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with Wanda.\u201d You said, heading in the same direction as Clint with Wanda following close behind. \n</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re stuck with me cap.\u201d Sam smirked and elbowed Steve in the arm making him chuckle.\n</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d \n</p><p>They soon followed suit of the rest of you, heading into their rooms as well. Each room had two queen sized beds, although the quality wasn\u2019t the greatest, you were okay to be there as long as it was a safe roof over your heads. \n</p><p>As the time passed the next day, you made sure to tell Steve about Wanda\u2019s plan to split up. He though it was genuinely a good idea as you would need to keep a low profile and traveling in a big group would draw attention.\n</p><p>To your surprise, someone came knocking on your door later in the afternoon. It was Natasha. You welcomed her with warm open arms as you knew she wasn\u2019t there to take any of you guys in. Steve had told you what she did for the team, so everyone was happy to welcome not only her but Vision into the group. He followed along because he didn\u2019t want to be away from Wanda in case anything happened. \n</p><p>Steve was almost worried about it but then later that night something happened that he did not expect. A phone call. A phone call from a number that belonged to the flip phone he had sent Tony in a the mail a few days prior. \n</p><p>He hesitantly picked it up, answering it as best he could. Tony immediately started talking.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve. I didn\u2019t think I would do this, but I know she\u2019s with you. How is she?\u201d he asked, speeding out his words with a wavering voice. \n</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, she\u2019s been warn out but she\u2019s fine.\u201d He replied, sitting down on the edge of the bed. Sam was in the shower at the time so Steve didn\u2019t have to worry about having him eavesdropping. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere are you guys?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cTony you know I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d \n</p><p>Tony heaved a heavy breath before sighing at those words.\n</p><p>\u201cI deserve to know where my daughter is Rogers. I can\u2019t be sure she\u2019s safe if I don\u2019t.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cTony I would never let anything happen to her. Ever. I will keep her safe at all costs.\u201d He was quick to tell him what he would do for you, letting him know his intentions. \n</p><p>\u201cSteve if you\u2019re planning to run you can\u2019t bring her with you.\u201d He spoke with a sincere voice, trying to approach the situation calmly.\n</p><p>\u201cTony I told you I won\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cThat might not be your decision cap. If they find you and she\u2019s with you, they won\u2019t hesitate to grab her as soon as you let your guard down. You know that.\u201d In his mind it made sense to bring you with him, but the way Tony put it was the more logical thing that might happen.\n</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose I do then, I can\u2019t just leave her?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re stashing Barnes somewhere, if she stays in one place away from you she won\u2019t get caught. Take her there and make sure she\u2019ll be safe.\u201d \n</p><p>Steve covered half his face with his hand, stressed out at the conversation. He is not only worried about you, but also conflicted because he wants to keep you with him. He thought about it for a moment before responding. \n</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cDeal. I\u2019ll put her somewhere safe but you have to promise not to try and find her yourself. I promise you she\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI can promise that.\u201d Tony said before abruptly hang in up the phone. Little did Steve know that was the last time he would talk to Tony for a long time.\n</p><p>Sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands, he had to think about how he was going to tell you. How he was going to leave you. He didn\u2019t want to, he would give anything not to. But he promised Tony he would do it for your safety, and your safety was more important than anything.\n</p><p>As if on cue, he heard crying coming from next door. He was about to stand up and walk out the door but as soon as he did he saw Natasha standing in front of him.\n</p><p>You and her were now bunking up because Vision insisted on staying with Wanda.\n</p><p>She woke up when you started crying and went to get Steve right away.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve she keeps saying your name I figured I should get you.\u201d He nodded and immediately went in to calm you down. Natasha went inside his room and got settled in, figuring that you would want Steve to stay with you tonight.\n</p><p><i>It was dark. There was a single light in the distance. Under the light was a small table with a knife and a note laying on top of it. The knife was covered in blood and when you looked down your hands were too. \n</i></p><p><i>You turned around at a loud sound, it sounded like a gun shot. You saw someone standing in the dark holding the gun, but it was pointed towards you. When you looked down there was a bullet hole right in your abdomen where you\u2019d been shot before. \n</i></p><p><i>The blood dropped down your body and onto your legs. You lost your balance and came crashing to the floor. You struggled to breathe and with all the blood you were losing, you were struggling to stay awake as well.\n</i></p><p><i>That was when you saw him. Steve came rushing to your side, holding you close to him. He had tears dripping down his face as he looked at you. He looked up towards the dark figure in the shadows holding a gun and shouted.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot her, me.\u201d\n</i></p><p><i>You were about to go completely into the darkness when you heard it again. A gunshot even louder than the first one sounded through your head. You suddenly were wide awake and had a surge of strength return to your body. You sat up and turned to the side, seeing Steve now laying instead on the floor, the life slowly draining from him. Bullet hole right in the middle of his chest as he laid there.\n</i></p><p><i>You clung to him as right as you could, lowering your face to kiss his lips once, twice and then tree times. It did nothing, he was still  dying there in your arms.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cSteve please don\u2019t leave me. Please don\u2019t leave me I love you Steve please. No.\u201d You cried, but your cries went unanswered, his eyes finally closing and his breath stopping.\n</i></p><p>You were shaken awake by a familiar presence, breathing fast as it all came crashing down. Your teary eyes opened to see Steve sitting next to you and you pulled him close to you, practically squeezing the life out of him as you did. \n</p><p>\u201cShh angel it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got you doll, I\u2019m here.\u201d He soothed, putting his other hand to the back of our head, cradling you head close to him.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. You\u2019re okay.\u201d You began to stop the tears that flowed, slowing your breathing and running your hands up and down his back. \n</p><p>He pulled back from you at arms length, cupping your face with his hand, stroking your cheek with his thumb.\n</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d\n</p><p>You were slightly hesitant at first, but then relaxed a bit, knowing that Steve was here for you and always was. Knowing that he adored you and would help you with this.\n</p><p>\u201cI was back in that room. There was a knife, it had blood on it, my blood. I heard a gunshot and the bullet went through me and I didn\u2019t even know it. You were there. You were with me but then he shot you. I wasn\u2019t hurt anymore but you died.\u201d Your breathing was rapid again, talking about it this time didn\u2019t seem to be helping you.\n</p><p>\u201cDoll I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m here,\u201d he kept trying to calm you down but to no avail, You kept shaking and began crying again. \u201cAngel I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cSteve please promise me you\u2019ll never leave me. I need you. Please promise me Steve.\u201d You could not even start to describe what would happen to you if something happened to him. You didn\u2019t want to think about what you might do to yourself, but it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.\n</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can promise that. Doll I have to tell you something.\u201d He lifted you chin so your eyes met his, tear streaked cheeks and all gazing up at him.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve please tell me whatever it is won\u2019t separate us. I can\u2019t do it. Not without you.\u201d You cried harder and harder, trying to contemplate what he was actually trying to say to you.\n</p><p>\u201cAngel it\u2019ll be okay. You are so strong. Tony called me, he thinks it might be a good idea to take you to Wakanda with Bucky. You\u2019ll be safe there and-\u201c I \n</p><p>\u201cNo Steve, please don\u2019t. Don\u2019t leave me there please. Steve let me come with you.\u201d You were having a full blown panic attack by now, not able to keep a coherent thought except for to try and convince him to stay with you.\n</p><p>\u201cBaby doll I can\u2019t put you in danger. Tony said they\u2019d come for you. I\u2019m not risking it, I can\u2019t risk it.\u201d He tried to reason with you but you weren\u2019t having it. You were not letting this one go. Every other time you would sit on the sidelines because Steve insists it was for you safety, but not this time. You weren\u2019t going down this time without a fight. You dried your tears as best you could, trying to make your voice as level as possible.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve no. I\u2019m not going to stay back without you. I need you. And as long as we\u2019re together it\u2019s worth the risk. I can handle myself and I want to be there for you.\u201d You spoke with a shaky, yet somewhat composed voice, but he knew how you were feeling on the inside, and this was killing him. \n</p><p>\u201cY/n this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about you.\u201d\n</p><p>His intentions seemed to be only one sided, and you knew just by looking at him that he didn\u2019t want to do this as much as you didn\u2019t.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve it is not just about me. What if something happened to you and I wasn\u2019t there. That would haunt me forever. Steve I already have dreams about it. If I wasn\u2019t there I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d You reached up to his face, trying to make him look you in the eye, as before then he\u2019d been looking anywhere but you. \u201cSteve we can\u2019t just split up purely because my dad said something about it to you. For all we know he could have just said that to get you to leave me somewhere so he can come get me himself.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe he would do that?\u201d this time it was you who didn\u2019t want to look him in the eye. Your dad wouldn\u2019t do that to you, not in a million years. He was the one who let you go, to be with Steve and fight with him.\n</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way we can compromise. I don\u2019t want to leave you so I won\u2019t. But here\u2019s the deal, wherever we go to hide out, you have to stay unless I\u2019m there with you to go out. And if there\u2019s even one instance where they come after you, then I\u2019m gonna take you to Wakanda.\u201d This was the ultimatum, but fortunately for you, it was a good one and meant you\u2019d get to stay with him. \n</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d You sniffled once more, and held your hand out for him to shake, which he did with a soft smile. \n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He let go of your hand and wrapped his arms around your small frame. You tucked your head under his chin with your face buried in his chest. \u201cDo you want me to stay with you tonight?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Natasha supposed to be in here?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cNo she switched with me so I could stay with you.\u201d\n</p><p>You nodded your head and laid down, him gently doing the same behind you and bringing his arms around your waist like he did at home. But that wasn\u2019t really your home, neither was anywhere else. You were home right in this moment, with Steve. He was your home and he always would be. \n</p><p>With peace and a now sound mind, you and Steve fell into a quiet slumber.</p><h2>Tags:</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\">@stickyqueenbouquetsstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\">@vxidnik</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\">@oliviaharddyy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\">@sunflowersun0212</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\">@gwynethjodie</a></p>",

Over that few day course, Bucky had made the decision to temporarily go back on the ice until the technicians could figure out how to stop his Russian mind control problem.<br></p><p>They said it would probably only be a few weeks at most, as they were highly advanced in the medical and technological field. He just wanted to be sure he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone until they could figure it out. He knew what he was like when he wasn\u2019t in control.\n</p><p>After he went under, Steve and you had devised a plan to break everyone out of the prison. Sharon Carter had given him the whereabouts of the floating Alcatraz and soon you guys arranged how you were going to do it.\n</p><p>You would pilot the ship, hovering it over the sea and he would swim out to the imprisonment. Simultaneously you would use your tech wiz skills to knock out the security so he could not only get in, but get himself and several others out.  \n</p><p>You would then stall the lockdown alert from getting to the mainland security just in time for you guys to get far away from the scene in order to keep them from tracking you.\n</p><p>It was the perfect plan and you were ready to help your captain at all costs, especially if it meant getting your team back. They were the closest thing you had to a family, and soon you would all be back together. \n</p><p>Suiting up was a lot more fun, Shurri and her tech crew had amped up the wow factor a little bit by adding micro tech and vibranium in your suit. It was cool to see it practically slither around your body. The normal silver metal was lined with glowing purple as it shined through the cracks. The arc reactor also had a purple glow to it now.\n</p><p>Looking across the room, Steve had strapped his gloves on, nodding to you to signify he was ready to go. \n</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d he asked you, you nodding as soon as he did.\n</p><p>\u201cBorn ready.\u201d \n</p><p>You saw the familiar smirk form on his face at the phrase. You both stood up, collecting your things before heading down to the quinjet. T\u2019challa stood there, holding two small devices in his hand, they looked almost like compasses but you couldn\u2019t be sure.\n</p><p>\u201cCaptain. I have something for you and the iron maiden.\u201d He glanced in your direction at the last part, making you blush from the nickname. He then placed the small devices in both of your hands, even you were not sure what they were.\n</p><p>\u201cThese are homing beacons. If you press that button, we can track you and find you if you\u2019re in need of help. You may not need them, but just in case.\u201d \n</p><p>You were so entranced in the small thing, you almost ignored what he said.\n</p><p>\u201cThank you T\u2019challa, for everything. What you\u2019ve done will always make me an ally.\u201d Steve finished as he shook the young king\u2019s hand. \n</p><p>\u201cAs long as you are an ally, Barnes will be well taken care of.\u201d He smiled, before turning to you. You had become quite fond of him the last few days, as you\u2019d spent some time conversing over the amazing technology of the place. \n</p><p>\u201cAnd as for you, miss iron girl\u2026 you are welcome here anytime you wish to stay.\u201d He smiled warmly before crossing his arms over his chest in an x shape, nodding to you both before he walked away.\n</p><p>You and Steve climbed aboard the transport, not even giving a second glance back when you closed the ramp. Taking your seat next to him you buckled yourself in, feeling the right straps hold you in place. You glanced up to your left, eyes meeting his with a smirk.\n</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get em\u2019 Cap.\u201d \n</p><p>-\n</p><p>Later that evening everyone was huddled together inside the quinjet, which you guys had chosen to land in the mountains so no one could find you. You were careful not to let anyone or anything track you after you successfully accomplished the rescue.\n</p><p>They were all a bit shaken up, but now that you\u2019d gotten them back they were okay. \n</p><p>Wanda hadn\u2019t really talked all night, but you figured you could change that pretty easily. You went over and sat by her. You opened your mouth to speak but she beat you to it.\n</p><p>\u201cY/n, I know that we are free. But they\u2019re still going to be after us. They will chase us down if they have to. Your father is going to enforce that by any means,\u201d she paused to rethink what she was about to say. \u201cI think that maybe all of us should split up. Make it harder for them to get us.\u201d \n</p><p>When she finished you knew where she was coming from, and in all sense it really would have been the smart thing to do, but it would take a lot of convincing for Steve to let it happen. He always wanted everyone to stick together. \n</p><p>Contemplating her words, and figuring out a way to make the plan possible, you nodded your head to her. She looked down at her hands then back up to you.\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not to say we should leave each other right away. This would take some planning. I do have an idea though of where we can hide before we figure everything out.\u201d \n</p><p>You turned your head, now intrigued at the place she had in mind. Knowing her it would be a safe place to possibly stay the week in. Maybe even longer, if needed be.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Steve.\u201d You nodded towards her and She gave you a smirk.\n</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with Steve?\u201d she chided, knowing full well of the \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 you two had been blooming over the years.\n</p><p>\u201cThey're\u2026. Going.\u201d You cut short, not wanting to go into full detail about your love confession right now. She just rolled her eyes and shrugged, not forcing you to speak about it any further.\n</p><p>\u201cThe place is a bunker not far from here,\u201d she spoke up again, changing the subject as quick as she could. \u201cWe could probably make it there by nightfall.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cYou think you could fly the ship there?\u201d You asked softly, slinking back in your seat as you spoke.\n</p><p>\u201cYes. But we\u2019d have to get moving.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on that then.\u201d \n</p><p>You stood up from you seat and over to Steve where Wanda watched you speak with him about the matter. She saw him look at you with a stern look before relaxing a bit and nodding his head. He turned to look at Maximoff, nodding his head at her too, giving her the signal that it was okay to fly the ship to a new place. She stood up and smiled, walking to the front of the transport and using her powers to get everything started up.\n</p><p>The flight wasn\u2019t long, even shorter than she had said it would be, and you all touched down before the sun set completely.\n</p><p>Outside was a small motel, no more than 20 rooms possibly, but it was low key and would for sure keep you guys hidden and safe from the public for the time being. You all unloaded and Sam went in and got rooms for everyone.\n</p><p>He came out about a minute later, holding key cards in his hands. \n</p><p>\u201cI could only get 3 rooms. Some of us are gonna have to bunk up.\u201d He said passing them around.\n</p><p>\u201cI can go with Scott.\u201d Clint took one of the key cards, heading in the direction of the rooms to put his stuff down.\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with Wanda.\u201d You said, heading in the same direction as Clint with Wanda following close behind. \n</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re stuck with me cap.\u201d Sam smirked and elbowed Steve in the arm making him chuckle.\n</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d \n</p><p>They soon followed suit of the rest of you, heading into their rooms as well. Each room had two queen sized beds, although the quality wasn\u2019t the greatest, you were okay to be there as long as it was a safe roof over your heads. \n</p><p>As the time passed the next day, you made sure to tell Steve about Wanda\u2019s plan to split up. He though it was genuinely a good idea as you would need to keep a low profile and traveling in a big group would draw attention.\n</p><p>To your surprise, someone came knocking on your door later in the afternoon. It was Natasha. You welcomed her with warm open arms as you knew she wasn\u2019t there to take any of you guys in. Steve had told you what she did for the team, so everyone was happy to welcome not only her but Vision into the group. He followed along because he didn\u2019t want to be away from Wanda in case anything happened. \n</p><p>Steve was almost worried about it but then later that night something happened that he did not expect. A phone call. A phone call from a number that belonged to the flip phone he had sent Tony in a the mail a few days prior. \n</p><p>He hesitantly picked it up, answering it as best he could. Tony immediately started talking.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve. I didn\u2019t think I would do this, but I know she\u2019s with you. How is she?\u201d he asked, speeding out his words with a wavering voice. \n</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, she\u2019s been warn out but she\u2019s fine.\u201d He replied, sitting down on the edge of the bed. Sam was in the shower at the time so Steve didn\u2019t have to worry about having him eavesdropping. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere are you guys?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cTony you know I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d \n</p><p>Tony heaved a heavy breath before sighing at those words.\n</p><p>\u201cI deserve to know where my daughter is Rogers. I can\u2019t be sure she\u2019s safe if I don\u2019t.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cTony I would never let anything happen to her. Ever. I will keep her safe at all costs.\u201d He was quick to tell him what he would do for you, letting him know his intentions. \n</p><p>\u201cSteve if you\u2019re planning to run you can\u2019t bring her with you.\u201d He spoke with a sincere voice, trying to approach the situation calmly.\n</p><p>\u201cTony I told you I won\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cThat might not be your decision cap. If they find you and she\u2019s with you, they won\u2019t hesitate to grab her as soon as you let your guard down. You know that.\u201d In his mind it made sense to bring you with him, but the way Tony put it was the more logical thing that might happen.\n</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose I do then, I can\u2019t just leave her?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re stashing Barnes somewhere, if she stays in one place away from you she won\u2019t get caught. Take her there and make sure she\u2019ll be safe.\u201d \n</p><p>Steve covered half his face with his hand, stressed out at the conversation. He is not only worried about you, but also conflicted because he wants to keep you with him. He thought about it for a moment before responding. \n</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cDeal. I\u2019ll put her somewhere safe but you have to promise not to try and find her yourself. I promise you she\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cI can promise that.\u201d Tony said before abruptly hang in up the phone. Little did Steve know that was the last time he would talk to Tony for a long time.\n</p><p>Sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands, he had to think about how he was going to tell you. How he was going to leave you. He didn\u2019t want to, he would give anything not to. But he promised Tony he would do it for your safety, and your safety was more important than anything.\n</p><p>As if on cue, he heard crying coming from next door. He was about to stand up and walk out the door but as soon as he did he saw Natasha standing in front of him.\n</p><p>You and her were now bunking up because Vision insisted on staying with Wanda.\n</p><p>She woke up when you started crying and went to get Steve right away.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve she keeps saying your name I figured I should get you.\u201d He nodded and immediately went in to calm you down. Natasha went inside his room and got settled in, figuring that you would want Steve to stay with you tonight.\n</p><p><i>It was dark. There was a single light in the distance. Under the light was a small table with a knife and a note laying on top of it. The knife was covered in blood and when you looked down your hands were too. \n</i></p><p><i>You turned around at a loud sound, it sounded like a gun shot. You saw someone standing in the dark holding the gun, but it was pointed towards you. When you looked down there was a bullet hole right in your abdomen where you\u2019d been shot before. \n</i></p><p><i>The blood dropped down your body and onto your legs. You lost your balance and came crashing to the floor. You struggled to breathe and with all the blood you were losing, you were struggling to stay awake as well.\n</i></p><p><i>That was when you saw him. Steve came rushing to your side, holding you close to him. He had tears dripping down his face as he looked at you. He looked up towards the dark figure in the shadows holding a gun and shouted.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot her, me.\u201d\n</i></p><p><i>You were about to go completely into the darkness when you heard it again. A gunshot even louder than the first one sounded through your head. You suddenly were wide awake and had a surge of strength return to your body. You sat up and turned to the side, seeing Steve now laying instead on the floor, the life slowly draining from him. Bullet hole right in the middle of his chest as he laid there.\n</i></p><p><i>You clung to him as right as you could, lowering your face to kiss his lips once, twice and then tree times. It did nothing, he was still  dying there in your arms.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cSteve please don\u2019t leave me. Please don\u2019t leave me I love you Steve please. No.\u201d You cried, but your cries went unanswered, his eyes finally closing and his breath stopping.\n</i></p><p>You were shaken awake by a familiar presence, breathing fast as it all came crashing down. Your teary eyes opened to see Steve sitting next to you and you pulled him close to you, practically squeezing the life out of him as you did. \n</p><p>\u201cShh angel it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got you doll, I\u2019m here.\u201d He soothed, putting his other hand to the back of our head, cradling you head close to him.\n</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. You\u2019re okay.\u201d You began to stop the tears that flowed, slowing your breathing and running your hands up and down his back. \n</p><p>He pulled back from you at arms length, cupping your face with his hand, stroking your cheek with his thumb.\n</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d\n</p><p>You were slightly hesitant at first, but then relaxed a bit, knowing that Steve was here for you and always was. Knowing that he adored you and would help you with this.\n</p><p>\u201cI was back in that room. There was a knife, it had blood on it, my blood. I heard a gunshot and the bullet went through me and I didn\u2019t even know it. You were there. You were with me but then he shot you. I wasn\u2019t hurt anymore but you died.\u201d Your breathing was rapid again, talking about it this time didn\u2019t seem to be helping you.\n</p><p>\u201cDoll I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m here,\u201d he kept trying to calm you down but to no avail, You kept shaking and began crying again. \u201cAngel I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cSteve please promise me you\u2019ll never leave me. I need you. Please promise me Steve.\u201d You could not even start to describe what would happen to you if something happened to him. You didn\u2019t want to think about what you might do to yourself, but it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.\n</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can promise that. Doll I have to tell you something.\u201d He lifted you chin so your eyes met his, tear streaked cheeks and all gazing up at him.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve please tell me whatever it is won\u2019t separate us. I can\u2019t do it. Not without you.\u201d You cried harder and harder, trying to contemplate what he was actually trying to say to you.\n</p><p>\u201cAngel it\u2019ll be okay. You are so strong. Tony called me, he thinks it might be a good idea to take you to Wakanda with Bucky. You\u2019ll be safe there and-\u201c I \n</p><p>\u201cNo Steve, please don\u2019t. Don\u2019t leave me there please. Steve let me come with you.\u201d You were having a full blown panic attack by now, not able to keep a coherent thought except for to try and convince him to stay with you.\n</p><p>\u201cBaby doll I can\u2019t put you in danger. Tony said they\u2019d come for you. I\u2019m not risking it, I can\u2019t risk it.\u201d He tried to reason with you but you weren\u2019t having it. You were not letting this one go. Every other time you would sit on the sidelines because Steve insists it was for you safety, but not this time. You weren\u2019t going down this time without a fight. You dried your tears as best you could, trying to make your voice as level as possible.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve no. I\u2019m not going to stay back without you. I need you. And as long as we\u2019re together it\u2019s worth the risk. I can handle myself and I want to be there for you.\u201d You spoke with a shaky, yet somewhat composed voice, but he knew how you were feeling on the inside, and this was killing him. \n</p><p>\u201cY/n this isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about you.\u201d\n</p><p>His intentions seemed to be only one sided, and you knew just by looking at him that he didn\u2019t want to do this as much as you didn\u2019t.\n</p><p>\u201cSteve it is not just about me. What if something happened to you and I wasn\u2019t there. That would haunt me forever. Steve I already have dreams about it. If I wasn\u2019t there I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d You reached up to his face, trying to make him look you in the eye, as before then he\u2019d been looking anywhere but you. \u201cSteve we can\u2019t just split up purely because my dad said something about it to you. For all we know he could have just said that to get you to leave me somewhere so he can come get me himself.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe he would do that?\u201d this time it was you who didn\u2019t want to look him in the eye. Your dad wouldn\u2019t do that to you, not in a million years. He was the one who let you go, to be with Steve and fight with him.\n</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way we can compromise. I don\u2019t want to leave you so I won\u2019t. But here\u2019s the deal, wherever we go to hide out, you have to stay unless I\u2019m there with you to go out. And if there\u2019s even one instance where they come after you, then I\u2019m gonna take you to Wakanda.\u201d This was the ultimatum, but fortunately for you, it was a good one and meant you\u2019d get to stay with him. \n</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d You sniffled once more, and held your hand out for him to shake, which he did with a soft smile. \n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He let go of your hand and wrapped his arms around your small frame. You tucked your head under his chin with your face buried in his chest. \u201cDo you want me to stay with you tonight?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Natasha supposed to be in here?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cNo she switched with me so I could stay with you.\u201d\n</p><p>You nodded your head and laid down, him gently doing the same behind you and bringing his arms around your waist like he did at home. But that wasn\u2019t really your home, neither was anywhere else. You were home right in this moment, with Steve. He was your home and he always would be. \n</p><p>With peace and a now sound mind, you and Steve fell into a quiet slumber.</p><h2>Tags:</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\">@stickyqueenbouquetsstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\">@vxidnik</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\">@oliviaharddyy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\">@sunflowersun0212</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\">@gwynethjodie</a></p>",

Over that few day course, Bucky had made the decision to temporarily go back on the ice until the technicians could figure out how to stop his Russian mind control problem.<br /></p><p>They said it would probably only be a few weeks at most, as they were highly advanced in the medical and technological field. He just wanted to be sure he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anyone until they could figure it out. He knew what he was like when he wasn&rsquo;t in control.\n</p><p>After he went under, Steve and you had devised a plan to break everyone out of the prison. Sharon Carter had given him the whereabouts of the floating Alcatraz and soon you guys arranged how you were going to do it.\n</p><p>You would pilot the ship, hovering it over the sea and he would swim out to the imprisonment. Simultaneously you would use your tech wiz skills to knock out the security so he could not only get in, but get himself and several others out.  \n</p><p>You would then stall the lockdown alert from getting to the mainland security just in time for you guys to get far away from the scene in order to keep them from tracking you.\n</p><p>It was the perfect plan and you were ready to help your captain at all costs, especially if it meant getting your team back. They were the closest thing you had to a family, and soon you would all be back together. \n</p><p>Suiting up was a lot more fun, Shurri and her tech crew had amped up the wow factor a little bit by adding micro tech and vibranium in your suit. It was cool to see it practically slither around your body. The normal silver metal was lined with glowing purple as it shined through the cracks. The arc reactor also had a purple glow to it now.\n</p><p>Looking across the room, Steve had strapped his gloves on, nodding to you to signify he was ready to go. \n</p><p>&ldquo;You ready to do this?&rdquo; he asked you, you nodding as soon as he did.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Born ready.&rdquo; \n</p><p>You saw the familiar smirk form on his face at the phrase. You both stood up, collecting your things before heading down to the quinjet. T&rsquo;challa stood there, holding two small devices in his hand, they looked almost like compasses but you couldn&rsquo;t be sure.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Captain. I have something for you and the iron maiden.&rdquo; He glanced in your direction at the last part, making you blush from the nickname. He then placed the small devices in both of your hands, even you were not sure what they were.\n</p><p>&ldquo;These are homing beacons. If you press that button, we can track you and find you if you&rsquo;re in need of help. You may not need them, but just in case.&rdquo; \n</p><p>You were so entranced in the small thing, you almost ignored what he said.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you T&rsquo;challa, for everything. What you&rsquo;ve done will always make me an ally.&rdquo; Steve finished as he shook the young king&rsquo;s hand. \n</p><p>&ldquo;As long as you are an ally, Barnes will be well taken care of.&rdquo; He smiled, before turning to you. You had become quite fond of him the last few days, as you&rsquo;d spent some time conversing over the amazing technology of the place. \n</p><p>&ldquo;And as for you, miss iron girl&hellip; you are welcome here anytime you wish to stay.&rdquo; He smiled warmly before crossing his arms over his chest in an x shape, nodding to you both before he walked away.\n</p><p>You and Steve climbed aboard the transport, not even giving a second glance back when you closed the ramp. Taking your seat next to him you buckled yourself in, feeling the right straps hold you in place. You glanced up to your left, eyes meeting his with a smirk.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go get em&rsquo; Cap.&rdquo; \n</p><p>-\n</p><p>Later that evening everyone was huddled together inside the quinjet, which you guys had chosen to land in the mountains so no one could find you. You were careful not to let anyone or anything track you after you successfully accomplished the rescue.\n</p><p>They were all a bit shaken up, but now that you&rsquo;d gotten them back they were okay. \n</p><p>Wanda hadn&rsquo;t really talked all night, but you figured you could change that pretty easily. You went over and sat by her. You opened your mouth to speak but she beat you to it.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I know that we are free. But they&rsquo;re still going to be after us. They will chase us down if they have to. Your father is going to enforce that by any means,&rdquo; she paused to rethink what she was about to say. &ldquo;I think that maybe all of us should split up. Make it harder for them to get us.&rdquo; \n</p><p>When she finished you knew where she was coming from, and in all sense it really would have been the smart thing to do, but it would take a lot of convincing for Steve to let it happen. He always wanted everyone to stick together. \n</p><p>Contemplating her words, and figuring out a way to make the plan possible, you nodded your head to her. She looked down at her hands then back up to you.\n</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not to say we should leave each other right away. This would take some planning. I do have an idea though of where we can hide before we figure everything out.&rdquo; \n</p><p>You turned your head, now intrigued at the place she had in mind. Knowing her it would be a safe place to possibly stay the week in. Maybe even longer, if needed be.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Steve.&rdquo; You nodded towards her and She gave you a smirk.\n</p><p>&ldquo;How are things going with Steve?&rdquo; she chided, knowing full well of the &lsquo;complicated relationship&rsquo; you two had been blooming over the years.\n</p><p>&ldquo;They're&hellip;. Going.&rdquo; You cut short, not wanting to go into full detail about your love confession right now. She just rolled her eyes and shrugged, not forcing you to speak about it any further.\n</p><p>&ldquo;The place is a bunker not far from here,&rdquo; she spoke up again, changing the subject as quick as she could. &ldquo;We could probably make it there by nightfall.&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;You think you could fly the ship there?&rdquo; You asked softly, slinking back in your seat as you spoke.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. But we&rsquo;d have to get moving.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get right on that then.&rdquo; \n</p><p>You stood up from you seat and over to Steve where Wanda watched you speak with him about the matter. She saw him look at you with a stern look before relaxing a bit and nodding his head. He turned to look at Maximoff, nodding his head at her too, giving her the signal that it was okay to fly the ship to a new place. She stood up and smiled, walking to the front of the transport and using her powers to get everything started up.\n</p><p>The flight wasn&rsquo;t long, even shorter than she had said it would be, and you all touched down before the sun set completely.\n</p><p>Outside was a small motel, no more than 20 rooms possibly, but it was low key and would for sure keep you guys hidden and safe from the public for the time being. You all unloaded and Sam went in and got rooms for everyone.\n</p><p>He came out about a minute later, holding key cards in his hands. \n</p><p>&ldquo;I could only get 3 rooms. Some of us are gonna have to bunk up.&rdquo; He said passing them around.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I can go with Scott.&rdquo; Clint took one of the key cards, heading in the direction of the rooms to put his stuff down.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with Wanda.&rdquo; You said, heading in the same direction as Clint with Wanda following close behind. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re stuck with me cap.&rdquo; Sam smirked and elbowed Steve in the arm making him chuckle.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Guess so.&rdquo; \n</p><p>They soon followed suit of the rest of you, heading into their rooms as well. Each room had two queen sized beds, although the quality wasn&rsquo;t the greatest, you were okay to be there as long as it was a safe roof over your heads. \n</p><p>As the time passed the next day, you made sure to tell Steve about Wanda&rsquo;s plan to split up. He though it was genuinely a good idea as you would need to keep a low profile and traveling in a big group would draw attention.\n</p><p>To your surprise, someone came knocking on your door later in the afternoon. It was Natasha. You welcomed her with warm open arms as you knew she wasn&rsquo;t there to take any of you guys in. Steve had told you what she did for the team, so everyone was happy to welcome not only her but Vision into the group. He followed along because he didn&rsquo;t want to be away from Wanda in case anything happened. \n</p><p>Steve was almost worried about it but then later that night something happened that he did not expect. A phone call. A phone call from a number that belonged to the flip phone he had sent Tony in a the mail a few days prior. \n</p><p>He hesitantly picked it up, answering it as best he could. Tony immediately started talking.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Steve. I didn&rsquo;t think I would do this, but I know she&rsquo;s with you. How is she?&rdquo; he asked, speeding out his words with a wavering voice. \n</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine, she&rsquo;s been warn out but she&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; He replied, sitting down on the edge of the bed. Sam was in the shower at the time so Steve didn&rsquo;t have to worry about having him eavesdropping. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you guys?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Tony you know I can&rsquo;t tell you that.&rdquo; \n</p><p>Tony heaved a heavy breath before sighing at those words.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I deserve to know where my daughter is Rogers. I can&rsquo;t be sure she&rsquo;s safe if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Tony I would never let anything happen to her. Ever. I will keep her safe at all costs.&rdquo; He was quick to tell him what he would do for you, letting him know his intentions. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Steve if you&rsquo;re planning to run you can&rsquo;t bring her with you.&rdquo; He spoke with a sincere voice, trying to approach the situation calmly.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Tony I told you I won&rsquo;t let anything happen to her.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;That might not be your decision cap. If they find you and she&rsquo;s with you, they won&rsquo;t hesitate to grab her as soon as you let your guard down. You know that.&rdquo; In his mind it made sense to bring you with him, but the way Tony put it was the more logical thing that might happen.\n</p><p>&ldquo;What do you suppose I do then, I can&rsquo;t just leave her?&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re stashing Barnes somewhere, if she stays in one place away from you she won&rsquo;t get caught. Take her there and make sure she&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo; \n</p><p>Steve covered half his face with his hand, stressed out at the conversation. He is not only worried about you, but also conflicted because he wants to keep you with him. He thought about it for a moment before responding. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Alright?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Deal. I&rsquo;ll put her somewhere safe but you have to promise not to try and find her yourself. I promise you she&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;I can promise that.&rdquo; Tony said before abruptly hang in up the phone. Little did Steve know that was the last time he would talk to Tony for a long time.\n</p><p>Sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands, he had to think about how he was going to tell you. How he was going to leave you. He didn&rsquo;t want to, he would give anything not to. But he promised Tony he would do it for your safety, and your safety was more important than anything.\n</p><p>As if on cue, he heard crying coming from next door. He was about to stand up and walk out the door but as soon as he did he saw Natasha standing in front of him.\n</p><p>You and her were now bunking up because Vision insisted on staying with Wanda.\n</p><p>She woke up when you started crying and went to get Steve right away.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Steve she keeps saying your name I figured I should get you.&rdquo; He nodded and immediately went in to calm you down. Natasha went inside his room and got settled in, figuring that you would want Steve to stay with you tonight.\n</p><p><i>It was dark. There was a single light in the distance. Under the light was a small table with a knife and a note laying on top of it. The knife was covered in blood and when you looked down your hands were too. \n</i></p><p><i>You turned around at a loud sound, it sounded like a gun shot. You saw someone standing in the dark holding the gun, but it was pointed towards you. When you looked down there was a bullet hole right in your abdomen where you&rsquo;d been shot before. \n</i></p><p><i>The blood dropped down your body and onto your legs. You lost your balance and came crashing to the floor. You struggled to breathe and with all the blood you were losing, you were struggling to stay awake as well.\n</i></p><p><i>That was when you saw him. Steve came rushing to your side, holding you close to him. He had tears dripping down his face as he looked at you. He looked up towards the dark figure in the shadows holding a gun and shouted.\n</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Not her, me.&rdquo;\n</i></p><p><i>You were about to go completely into the darkness when you heard it again. A gunshot even louder than the first one sounded through your head. You suddenly were wide awake and had a surge of strength return to your body. You sat up and turned to the side, seeing Steve now laying instead on the floor, the life slowly draining from him. Bullet hole right in the middle of his chest as he laid there.\n</i></p><p><i>You clung to him as right as you could, lowering your face to kiss his lips once, twice and then tree times. It did nothing, he was still  dying there in your arms.\n</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Steve please don&rsquo;t leave me. Please don&rsquo;t leave me I love you Steve please. No.&rdquo; You cried, but your cries went unanswered, his eyes finally closing and his breath stopping.\n</i></p><p>You were shaken awake by a familiar presence, breathing fast as it all came crashing down. Your teary eyes opened to see Steve sitting next to you and you pulled him close to you, practically squeezing the life out of him as you did. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Shh angel it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ve got you doll, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; He soothed, putting his other hand to the back of our head, cradling you head close to him.\n</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here. You&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; You began to stop the tears that flowed, slowing your breathing and running your hands up and down his back. \n</p><p>He pulled back from you at arms length, cupping your face with his hand, stroking your cheek with his thumb.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna talk about it?&rdquo;\n</p><p>You were slightly hesitant at first, but then relaxed a bit, knowing that Steve was here for you and always was. Knowing that he adored you and would help you with this.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I was back in that room. There was a knife, it had blood on it, my blood. I heard a gunshot and the bullet went through me and I didn&rsquo;t even know it. You were there. You were with me but then he shot you. I wasn&rsquo;t hurt anymore but you died.&rdquo; Your breathing was rapid again, talking about it this time didn&rsquo;t seem to be helping you.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Doll I&rsquo;m okay, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he kept trying to calm you down but to no avail, You kept shaking and began crying again. &ldquo;Angel I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Steve please promise me you&rsquo;ll never leave me. I need you. Please promise me Steve.&rdquo; You could not even start to describe what would happen to you if something happened to him. You didn&rsquo;t want to think about what you might do to yourself, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be pretty.\n</p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know if I can promise that. Doll I have to tell you something.&rdquo; He lifted you chin so your eyes met his, tear streaked cheeks and all gazing up at him.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Steve please tell me whatever it is won&rsquo;t separate us. I can&rsquo;t do it. Not without you.&rdquo; You cried harder and harder, trying to contemplate what he was actually trying to say to you.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Angel it&rsquo;ll be okay. You are so strong. Tony called me, he thinks it might be a good idea to take you to Wakanda with Bucky. You&rsquo;ll be safe there and-&ldquo; I \n</p><p>&ldquo;No Steve, please don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t leave me there please. Steve let me come with you.&rdquo; You were having a full blown panic attack by now, not able to keep a coherent thought except for to try and convince him to stay with you.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Baby doll I can&rsquo;t put you in danger. Tony said they&rsquo;d come for you. I&rsquo;m not risking it, I can&rsquo;t risk it.&rdquo; He tried to reason with you but you weren&rsquo;t having it. You were not letting this one go. Every other time you would sit on the sidelines because Steve insists it was for you safety, but not this time. You weren&rsquo;t going down this time without a fight. You dried your tears as best you could, trying to make your voice as level as possible.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Steve no. I&rsquo;m not going to stay back without you. I need you. And as long as we&rsquo;re together it&rsquo;s worth the risk. I can handle myself and I want to be there for you.&rdquo; You spoke with a shaky, yet somewhat composed voice, but he knew how you were feeling on the inside, and this was killing him. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n this isn&rsquo;t about me, it&rsquo;s about you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>His intentions seemed to be only one sided, and you knew just by looking at him that he didn&rsquo;t want to do this as much as you didn&rsquo;t.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Steve it is not just about me. What if something happened to you and I wasn&rsquo;t there. That would haunt me forever. Steve I already have dreams about it. If I wasn&rsquo;t there I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo; You reached up to his face, trying to make him look you in the eye, as before then he&rsquo;d been looking anywhere but you. &ldquo;Steve we can&rsquo;t just split up purely because my dad said something about it to you. For all we know he could have just said that to get you to leave me somewhere so he can come get me himself.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really believe he would do that?&rdquo; this time it was you who didn&rsquo;t want to look him in the eye. Your dad wouldn&rsquo;t do that to you, not in a million years. He was the one who let you go, to be with Steve and fight with him.\n</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a way we can compromise. I don&rsquo;t want to leave you so I won&rsquo;t. But here&rsquo;s the deal, wherever we go to hide out, you have to stay unless I&rsquo;m there with you to go out. And if there&rsquo;s even one instance where they come after you, then I&rsquo;m gonna take you to Wakanda.&rdquo; This was the ultimatum, but fortunately for you, it was a good one and meant you&rsquo;d get to stay with him. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo; You sniffled once more, and held your hand out for him to shake, which he did with a soft smile. \n</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my girl.&rdquo; He let go of your hand and wrapped his arms around your small frame. You tucked your head under his chin with your face buried in his chest. &ldquo;Do you want me to stay with you tonight?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Natasha supposed to be in here?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;No she switched with me so I could stay with you.&rdquo;\n</p><p>You nodded your head and laid down, him gently doing the same behind you and bringing his arms around your waist like he did at home. But that wasn&rsquo;t really your home, neither was anywhere else. You were home right in this moment, with Steve. He was your home and he always would be. \n</p><p>With peace and a now sound mind, you and Steve fell into a quiet slumber.</p><h2>Tags:</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPhfL9jc1ee0KRAd5XTowgA\">@h0tshotstark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpg-_glgqi79I98SYY0CUsQ\">@stickyqueenbouquetsstuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\">@vxidnik</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBQmx7WtYl_6UuZc9UVj3g\">@oliviaharddyy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7w1GVSVfK083A666bGjVHw\">@sunflowersun0212</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRlFp3ibHYRP2PtzAH-bdUg\">@gwynethjodie</a></p>",

They\u2019d gotten an array of both sympathetic looks and annoyed ones from a number of passengers while walking him up and down the aisle to try and console him a little bit. He hadn\u2019t completely calmed down until they were on the ground again. Thankfully, he hadn\u2019t been seizing or trembling at all since they left the hospital. The treatments had seemed to work. They\u2019d still have to keep a close eye on him for the following month but it really seemed like the withdrawals were over. </p><p>-</p><p>Currently they were in their SUV on the way home. Sebastian was sitting in the back seat with Luca. Luca was greedily drinking from his bottle. His little greenish-blue eyes looking up at his dad from underneath a soft little baby blue hat. His tiny hands were still covered with mittens so he didn\u2019t hurt himself And his small body was swaddled to keep him calm and warm. It was fall but it felt like winter here in New England. </p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d Sebastian asked as he pulled the bottle away. Luca snuffed and murmured and his little arms flailed in an answer. Sebastian lifted him out of the seat to put him over his shoulder to burp him and with two good burps he pulled him away whispering praises. </p><p>\u201cAh, good burp, good for you,\u201d he said. As he put him back into his car seat and buckled him back up. Chris looked up and smiled as he caught a glimpse of the two in his rear view. Sebastian then took a moment to look outside. They were almost home. Another ten minutes and they\u2019d be there. </p><p>-</p><p>The sun was just beginning it\u2019s slow decent in the sky. It was a little after midday when Chris pulled into their garage. The car turned off and the two new parents got out of the car. Chris got the luggage from the trunk while Sebastian handled Luca. Luca was quietly wiggling around in his car seat looking around with wonder and trying to fit his covered hands into his mouth. He made a happy little cooing sound as he was moved from the car and carried by Sebastian over to the stairs to get inside. </p><p>\u201cDodger\u2019s here, do you think we should introduce them now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, he\u2019s been around plenty of babies and children before, but let me go in and greet him separately first and then we can switch so he has a moment to get excited before we bring Luca in. You know he gets excited when we come home,\u201d Sebastian nodded. </p><p>Chris went in first. He put the keys down on the counter and called out for Dodger in a moment the happy mutt was barreling towards him. Tongue lulling out and and jumping up at him, they hadn\u2019t seen each other in two and a half weeks so the excitement was warranted. </p><p>\u201cHey bubba! Hey, yes. I missed you too! I missed you so much,\u201d Dodger happily yipped and jumped and licked at Chris\u2019s face as he greeted him. \u201cGood boy,\u201d Chris said. \u201cNow stay,\u201d Dodger stayed where he was asked. Tail wagging happily. A few moments later Sebastian entered and was given the same treatment as Chris with happily excited licks to the face and paws on his shoulders as he knelt down to greet him. </p><p>\u201cYou are such a good boy, I missed you too, yes I did, you\u2019re the best,\u201d he praised the dog and continued to generously pet him all over. \u201cNow, guess what? We\u2019ve got someone for you to meet, come here,\u201d he said, he clipped Dodger\u2019s leash on him. Dodger looked confused. They knew he\u2019d just been on a walk because their Dog Walker had just updated them that he\u2019d been on one before they came home. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he promised the dog. He knocked on the outside door that led to the garage to signal that it was okay for Chris to come inside with the baby. The door opened slowly and Chris stepped inside. Luca in the car seat. Dodgers ears immediately perked up when he heard the soft sounds of the baby cooing and gurgling from the seat he did a little round about, walking in a circle. His tail wagging as he got closer to Chris who was holding the carriage up high. </p><p>\u201cDodger, this is your new little brother, do you want to say hi? If so you have to sit,\u201d he told the dog. Dodger sat down, right there in the side of the entrance way and let his tail thump on the ground lightly as he waited for farther instruction. Slowly Chris lowered the carriage to the floor, telling Dodger to stay as he did so. Dodger didn\u2019t move from his spot as Chris waited.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Chris told Dodger and that was Dodger\u2019s cue to stand. As if on instinct he came up to the baby carriage and sniffed around. Not licking or jumping or doing anything wrong. He\u2019d been around babies before but it was like he was taking extra care around this one. He kept his distance and didn\u2019t put his face into the seat. Staying around the boarder as he sniffed. Luca cooed again, little hands coming out far enough to touch Dodger. Dodger just let the baby gently bat at him. Finally he got closer. His nose gently nudging at Luca\u2019s little head as he sniffed him. Luca\u2019s head moved as he tried to follow the dog\u2019s movements. Neither one seemed distressed. Only curious about one and other. Dodger slowly sniffed down Luca\u2019s little body before sitting down in front of the baby carrier. He tilted his head one way and then another before leaning in again and getting right up into Luca\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cWhoa, Dodger-\u201c Sebastian cut himself off when Luca gave a happy squeal snuffle and his arms flailed around as Dodger licked the side of his face. Luca was laughing. It was a sound they\u2019d only heard one other time and it warned both of their hearts to hear it for the second time directed back at Dodger. Dodger didn\u2019t bark or startle at the sudden loud noise. He just sniffed again at the top of Luca\u2019s head before sitting back and then looking up at Chris. A wide doggy smile on his face. As if to say \u201cI like it, what is it? Are we keeping it?\u201d All in one. Chris gave Dodger a pat on the head and told him he was a good boy once again as he went to get a baby wipe from the counter to wipe off Luca\u2019s face from dog slobber. After Luca was clean Sebastian headed upstairs with him nestled into his arms, while Chris took a moment to  take a few work phone calls he\u2019d been putting off. Dodger followed Sebastian up stairs. Taking the steps two by two and arriving at the top first. Dodger trotted over to the nursery without prompting. A very smart dog indeed, Sebastian thought. He smiled at Dodger as he entered into the room. Dodger followed him inside. Sebastian took a seat in the comfortable rocker. He unswaddled Luca partway, Not wanting him to overheat inside. He let the blanket draped across his arm and lap as he held Luca on top of it as he rocked him slowly to sleep. It didn\u2019t take long, the baby was tired. Dodger had taken a vigilant watch a few feet away from Sebastian. He was relaxed but still alert. Lying on his stomach but with his head up and panting. Ready to jump up at a moments notice of danger. When Sebastian stood Dodger did as well. Sebastian slowly lowered Luca into the crib, he turned the mobile above his crib on, it was a set of glowing stars and moons. The mobile could be hooked up through Bluetooth to play lullabies or simply just spin and twinkle. He put it on the latter setting this time. Dodger sat by the crib. Watching as Sebastian brushed a soft hand over Luca\u2019s tiny head before he leaned against the crib to just watch him sleep for a while. Luca didn\u2019t move much in his sleep. Occasionally he smacked his little lips together and his hand would twitch but there were no violent seizing motions or twitches like there had been early on before the withdrawal. Then it had been hard to watch him sleep. Too painful of a reminder that there was nothing more they could do to help his pain and suffering, now that he was sleeping calmly Sebastian felt like he could watch him for hours as his tiny chest rose and fell Sebastian felt himself falling more and more in love.</p><p>Finally after another fifteen minutes of watching him sleep Sebastian straightened up. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Dodger stand at attention as well. Sebastian reached down to pet him. </p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d he said, \u201ccome on, this way, let\u2019s let him sleep.\u201d Sebastian was standing in the door frame. He hadn\u2019t heard he tinkle of Dodger\u2019s collar following so he looked back. Dodger looked unsure as he stood between Luca and Sebastian. He glanced back at Luca in the crib, as if to say, \u201cyou\u2019re just gonna leave him? Are you sure that he\u2019s gonna be okay?\u201d As if to prove his thoughts Dodger turned his head back and gave a little whine. Sebastian chuffed at the sweet gesture. </p><p>\u201cCome on bud, he\u2019ll be fine. He needs to sleep for now. You two can hang out later,\u201d he told him. And with a few more cursory glances back Dodger finally trotted over to the open door. Sebastian hooked the baby monitor to his belt and turned the volume all the way up as he cracked the door behind him. </p><p>-</p><p>Sebastian reached the top of the stairs ready to head down. Once again caught off guard when Dodger wasn\u2019t at his heels. He looked back, Dodger was again glancing back at the half closed door. Sebastian let out a low chuckle, </p><p>\u201cCome on Bub, Luca will be okay, I promise,\u201d Sebastian went back over to Dodger and knelt down in front of him to scratch him behind the ear. </p><p>\u201cI promise, he\u2019ll be okay, let\u2019s let him sleep for now, you want to go outside? Dad brought you back some new dog treats? Maybe we can play fetch, huh? How does that sound?\u201d He asked Dodger at the word \u201cTreats\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d his ears perked up and he was following Sebastian down the stairs with a pep in his steps. </p><p>-</p><p>The next day Chris had Luca propped up in a baby chair in the living room as he sorted through a pile of paperwork. Sebastian was somewhere else in the house doing some sort of chore. Probably laundry. But Chris didn\u2019t know. Every few moments he\u2019d find himself looking up and smiling at the sight in front of him. Luca was in his chair playfully batting at the dangling rattling, crinkly, and shiny objects hanging from the handle above him while dodger lied out half curled around the chair with his head in his paws. Dodger had really taken to the two month old in the last 24 hours. As soon as Sebastian had woken up at the cries in the middle of the night Dodger had too. He had followed Sebastian into the baby\u2019s room and stayed with Sebastian and Luca until Luca was quiet and sleeping again. This happened three more times throughout the night and each time Dodger was up and alert and ready to protect and watch. He even did his own check of the crib every time before leaving the room and it warmed Sebastian and Chris\u2019s hearts to see.</p><p>-</p><p>Luca was in his baby carrier crying his eyes out. They\u2019d taken him to the doctor after the fourth day of near constant crying. Dodger, the poor pup, had only been able to take so much before retreating outside to his Doghouse. It wasn\u2019t colic and Sebastian and Chris were glad of that. They\u2019d done all they could think of. He didn\u2019t need a change, he didn\u2019t want food, didn\u2019t need to be burped, rocked, held, or anything else. It was breaking Chris\u2019s heart to have to watch and was quite frankly, driving Sebastian slightly mad. But he remained calm. Doing all he could think of. Currently Luca was in his carrier on the floor, still bawling his little hands and legs flailing as he did so. Chris came in from Dodger\u2019s morning walk. Unlike usual for the past few days Dodger didn\u2019t immediately head outside. This time he slowly and cautiously walked up to the carriage. Chris was about to call him back but Dodger didn\u2019t bark or pounce, he instead placed his paw on it and began to rock it slightly. Still crying, Luca opened his eyes. And for the first time in a few hours he paused in his crying. His hands coming out and reaching for the dog. Dodger moves forward. He began licking Luca\u2019s head and Luca\u2019s little fists fisted themselves in his fur. Dodger pulled away and stopped licking but he sat down, resting his body over the baby carrier completely and just lying there. Chris and Sebastian watched on with awe as Luca slowly stopped crying his cries fading to quiet whimpers and then silence before soft and content cooing sounds replaced them as Luca continued to run his little hands through Dodger\u2019s fur. </p><p>\u201cWell would you look at that?\u201d Chris commented coming over to Sebastian. Sebastian was still shocked himself. </p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have tried this three days ago Dodge?\u201d He wondered aloud. Chris laughed,  </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Good boy,\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat he is,\u201d Sebastian said as he sighed. Closing his eyes for a moment and relishing in the silence for the first time in days. </p><p>-</p><p>From then on whenever Luca would start wailing Dodger would come running. If Luca was crying in his crib Dodger would stick a paw or a snout through the bars and as soon as Luca saw him he\u2019d begin to calm down. It was almost like magic. When Luca would be playing on his play mat during the day dodger would sit and watch from his spot close by where the sun would shine in through the window. When Luca would push a ball a little out of his reach (before he started crawling) Dodger would be sure to nudge it back before the whimpering started. </p><p>Dodger was taking his duties as big brother very seriously and it warmed Chris\u2019s heart the most to see baby and dog bonding so well. </p><p>The only place they drew the line at was when Luca was sleeping at night. Dodger wasn\u2019t allowed in the room and there was a baby gate that opened and closed for that reason at Luca\u2019s door. Dodger was the best baby monitor there was at night though, because he\u2019d be jumping onto Chris and Sebastian\u2019s bed before the cries got loud enough to wake them up to let them know Luca was up and needing attention.</p>",

Poor little Luca had been fussy and uncomfortable the whole time. And on top of that, they\u2019d been in coach. They\u2019d gotten an array of both sympathetic looks and annoyed ones from a number of passengers while walking him up and down the aisle to try and console him a little bit. He hadn\u2019t completely calmed down until they were on the ground again. Thankfully, he hadn\u2019t been seizing or trembling at all since they left the hospital. The treatments had seemed to work. They\u2019d still have to keep a close eye on him for the following month but it really seemed like the withdrawals were over. </p><p>-</p><p>Currently they were in their SUV on the way home. Sebastian was sitting in the back seat with Luca. Luca was greedily drinking from his bottle. His little greenish-blue eyes looking up at his dad from underneath a soft little baby blue hat. His tiny hands were still covered with mittens so he didn\u2019t hurt himself And his small body was swaddled to keep him calm and warm. It was fall but it felt like winter here in New England. </p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d Sebastian asked as he pulled the bottle away. Luca snuffed and murmured and his little arms flailed in an answer. Sebastian lifted him out of the seat to put him over his shoulder to burp him and with two good burps he pulled him away whispering praises. </p><p>\u201cAh, good burp, good for you,\u201d he said. As he put him back into his car seat and buckled him back up. Chris looked up and smiled as he caught a glimpse of the two in his rear view. Sebastian then took a moment to look outside. They were almost home. Another ten minutes and they\u2019d be there. </p><p>-</p><p>The sun was just beginning it\u2019s slow decent in the sky. It was a little after midday when Chris pulled into their garage. The car turned off and the two new parents got out of the car. Chris got the luggage from the trunk while Sebastian handled Luca. Luca was quietly wiggling around in his car seat looking around with wonder and trying to fit his covered hands into his mouth. He made a happy little cooing sound as he was moved from the car and carried by Sebastian over to the stairs to get inside. </p><p>\u201cDodger\u2019s here, do you think we should introduce them now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, he\u2019s been around plenty of babies and children before, but let me go in and greet him separately first and then we can switch so he has a moment to get excited before we bring Luca in. You know he gets excited when we come home,\u201d Sebastian nodded. </p><p>Chris went in first. He put the keys down on the counter and called out for Dodger in a moment the happy mutt was barreling towards him. Tongue lulling out and and jumping up at him, they hadn\u2019t seen each other in two and a half weeks so the excitement was warranted. </p><p>\u201cHey bubba! Hey, yes. I missed you too! I missed you so much,\u201d Dodger happily yipped and jumped and licked at Chris\u2019s face as he greeted him. \u201cGood boy,\u201d Chris said. \u201cNow stay,\u201d Dodger stayed where he was asked. Tail wagging happily. A few moments later Sebastian entered and was given the same treatment as Chris with happily excited licks to the face and paws on his shoulders as he knelt down to greet him. </p><p>\u201cYou are such a good boy, I missed you too, yes I did, you\u2019re the best,\u201d he praised the dog and continued to generously pet him all over. \u201cNow, guess what? We\u2019ve got someone for you to meet, come here,\u201d he said, he clipped Dodger\u2019s leash on him. Dodger looked confused. They knew he\u2019d just been on a walk because their Dog Walker had just updated them that he\u2019d been on one before they came home. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he promised the dog. He knocked on the outside door that led to the garage to signal that it was okay for Chris to come inside with the baby. The door opened slowly and Chris stepped inside. Luca in the car seat. Dodgers ears immediately perked up when he heard the soft sounds of the baby cooing and gurgling from the seat he did a little round about, walking in a circle. His tail wagging as he got closer to Chris who was holding the carriage up high. </p><p>\u201cDodger, this is your new little brother, do you want to say hi? If so you have to sit,\u201d he told the dog. Dodger sat down, right there in the side of the entrance way and let his tail thump on the ground lightly as he waited for farther instruction. Slowly Chris lowered the carriage to the floor, telling Dodger to stay as he did so. Dodger didn\u2019t move from his spot as Chris waited.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Chris told Dodger and that was Dodger\u2019s cue to stand. As if on instinct he came up to the baby carriage and sniffed around. Not licking or jumping or doing anything wrong. He\u2019d been around babies before but it was like he was taking extra care around this one. He kept his distance and didn\u2019t put his face into the seat. Staying around the boarder as he sniffed. Luca cooed again, little hands coming out far enough to touch Dodger. Dodger just let the baby gently bat at him. Finally he got closer. His nose gently nudging at Luca\u2019s little head as he sniffed him. Luca\u2019s head moved as he tried to follow the dog\u2019s movements. Neither one seemed distressed. Only curious about one and other. Dodger slowly sniffed down Luca\u2019s little body before sitting down in front of the baby carrier. He tilted his head one way and then another before leaning in again and getting right up into Luca\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cWhoa, Dodger-\u201c Sebastian cut himself off when Luca gave a happy squeal snuffle and his arms flailed around as Dodger licked the side of his face. Luca was laughing. It was a sound they\u2019d only heard one other time and it warned both of their hearts to hear it for the second time directed back at Dodger. Dodger didn\u2019t bark or startle at the sudden loud noise. He just sniffed again at the top of Luca\u2019s head before sitting back and then looking up at Chris. A wide doggy smile on his face. As if to say \u201cI like it, what is it? Are we keeping it?\u201d All in one. Chris gave Dodger a pat on the head and told him he was a good boy once again as he went to get a baby wipe from the counter to wipe off Luca\u2019s face from dog slobber. After Luca was clean Sebastian headed upstairs with him nestled into his arms, while Chris took a moment to  take a few work phone calls he\u2019d been putting off. Dodger followed Sebastian up stairs. Taking the steps two by two and arriving at the top first. Dodger trotted over to the nursery without prompting. A very smart dog indeed, Sebastian thought. He smiled at Dodger as he entered into the room. Dodger followed him inside. Sebastian took a seat in the comfortable rocker. He unswaddled Luca partway, Not wanting him to overheat inside. He let the blanket draped across his arm and lap as he held Luca on top of it as he rocked him slowly to sleep. It didn\u2019t take long, the baby was tired. Dodger had taken a vigilant watch a few feet away from Sebastian. He was relaxed but still alert. Lying on his stomach but with his head up and panting. Ready to jump up at a moments notice of danger. When Sebastian stood Dodger did as well. Sebastian slowly lowered Luca into the crib, he turned the mobile above his crib on, it was a set of glowing stars and moons. The mobile could be hooked up through Bluetooth to play lullabies or simply just spin and twinkle. He put it on the latter setting this time. Dodger sat by the crib. Watching as Sebastian brushed a soft hand over Luca\u2019s tiny head before he leaned against the crib to just watch him sleep for a while. Luca didn\u2019t move much in his sleep. Occasionally he smacked his little lips together and his hand would twitch but there were no violent seizing motions or twitches like there had been early on before the withdrawal. Then it had been hard to watch him sleep. Too painful of a reminder that there was nothing more they could do to help his pain and suffering, now that he was sleeping calmly Sebastian felt like he could watch him for hours as his tiny chest rose and fell Sebastian felt himself falling more and more in love.</p><p>Finally after another fifteen minutes of watching him sleep Sebastian straightened up. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Dodger stand at attention as well. Sebastian reached down to pet him. </p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d he said, \u201ccome on, this way, let\u2019s let him sleep.\u201d Sebastian was standing in the door frame. He hadn\u2019t heard he tinkle of Dodger\u2019s collar following so he looked back. Dodger looked unsure as he stood between Luca and Sebastian. He glanced back at Luca in the crib, as if to say, \u201cyou\u2019re just gonna leave him? Are you sure that he\u2019s gonna be okay?\u201d As if to prove his thoughts Dodger turned his head back and gave a little whine. Sebastian chuffed at the sweet gesture. </p><p>\u201cCome on bud, he\u2019ll be fine. He needs to sleep for now. You two can hang out later,\u201d he told him. And with a few more cursory glances back Dodger finally trotted over to the open door. Sebastian hooked the baby monitor to his belt and turned the volume all the way up as he cracked the door behind him. </p><p>-</p><p>Sebastian reached the top of the stairs ready to head down. Once again caught off guard when Dodger wasn\u2019t at his heels. He looked back, Dodger was again glancing back at the half closed door. Sebastian let out a low chuckle, </p><p>\u201cCome on Bub, Luca will be okay, I promise,\u201d Sebastian went back over to Dodger and knelt down in front of him to scratch him behind the ear. </p><p>\u201cI promise, he\u2019ll be okay, let\u2019s let him sleep for now, you want to go outside? Dad brought you back some new dog treats? Maybe we can play fetch, huh? How does that sound?\u201d He asked Dodger at the word \u201cTreats\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d his ears perked up and he was following Sebastian down the stairs with a pep in his steps. </p><p>-</p><p>The next day Chris had Luca propped up in a baby chair in the living room as he sorted through a pile of paperwork. Sebastian was somewhere else in the house doing some sort of chore. Probably laundry. But Chris didn\u2019t know. Every few moments he\u2019d find himself looking up and smiling at the sight in front of him. Luca was in his chair playfully batting at the dangling rattling, crinkly, and shiny objects hanging from the handle above him while dodger lied out half curled around the chair with his head in his paws. Dodger had really taken to the two month old in the last 24 hours. As soon as Sebastian had woken up at the cries in the middle of the night Dodger had too. He had followed Sebastian into the baby\u2019s room and stayed with Sebastian and Luca until Luca was quiet and sleeping again. This happened three more times throughout the night and each time Dodger was up and alert and ready to protect and watch. He even did his own check of the crib every time before leaving the room and it warmed Sebastian and Chris\u2019s hearts to see.</p><p>-</p><p>Luca was in his baby carrier crying his eyes out. They\u2019d taken him to the doctor after the fourth day of near constant crying. Dodger, the poor pup, had only been able to take so much before retreating outside to his Doghouse. It wasn\u2019t colic and Sebastian and Chris were glad of that. They\u2019d done all they could think of. He didn\u2019t need a change, he didn\u2019t want food, didn\u2019t need to be burped, rocked, held, or anything else. It was breaking Chris\u2019s heart to have to watch and was quite frankly, driving Sebastian slightly mad. But he remained calm. Doing all he could think of. Currently Luca was in his carrier on the floor, still bawling his little hands and legs flailing as he did so. Chris came in from Dodger\u2019s morning walk. Unlike usual for the past few days Dodger didn\u2019t immediately head outside. This time he slowly and cautiously walked up to the carriage. Chris was about to call him back but Dodger didn\u2019t bark or pounce, he instead placed his paw on it and began to rock it slightly. Still crying, Luca opened his eyes. And for the first time in a few hours he paused in his crying. His hands coming out and reaching for the dog. Dodger moves forward. He began licking Luca\u2019s head and Luca\u2019s little fists fisted themselves in his fur. Dodger pulled away and stopped licking but he sat down, resting his body over the baby carrier completely and just lying there. Chris and Sebastian watched on with awe as Luca slowly stopped crying his cries fading to quiet whimpers and then silence before soft and content cooing sounds replaced them as Luca continued to run his little hands through Dodger\u2019s fur. </p><p>\u201cWell would you look at that?\u201d Chris commented coming over to Sebastian. Sebastian was still shocked himself. </p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have tried this three days ago Dodge?\u201d He wondered aloud. Chris laughed,  </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Good boy,\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat he is,\u201d Sebastian said as he sighed. Closing his eyes for a moment and relishing in the silence for the first time in days. </p><p>-</p><p>From then on whenever Luca would start wailing Dodger would come running. If Luca was crying in his crib Dodger would stick a paw or a snout through the bars and as soon as Luca saw him he\u2019d begin to calm down. It was almost like magic. When Luca would be playing on his play mat during the day dodger would sit and watch from his spot close by where the sun would shine in through the window. When Luca would push a ball a little out of his reach (before he started crawling) Dodger would be sure to nudge it back before the whimpering started. </p><p>Dodger was taking his duties as big brother very seriously and it warmed Chris\u2019s heart the most to see baby and dog bonding so well. </p><p>The only place they drew the line at was when Luca was sleeping at night. Dodger wasn\u2019t allowed in the room and there was a baby gate that opened and closed for that reason at Luca\u2019s door.

Luca was in his chair playfully batting at the dangling rattling, crinkly, and shiny objects hanging from the handle above him while dodger lied out half curled around the chair with his head in his paws. Dodger had really taken to the two month old in the last 24 hours. As soon as Sebastian had woken up at the cries in the middle of the night Dodger had too. He had followed Sebastian into the baby&rsquo;s room and stayed with Sebastian and Luca until Luca was quiet and sleeping again. This happened three more times throughout the night and each time Dodger was up and alert and ready to protect and watch. He even did his own check of the crib every time before leaving the room and it warmed Sebastian and Chris&rsquo;s hearts to see.</p><p>-</p><p>Luca was in his baby carrier crying his eyes out. They&rsquo;d taken him to the doctor after the fourth day of near constant crying. Dodger, the poor pup, had only been able to take so much before retreating outside to his Doghouse. It wasn&rsquo;t colic and Sebastian and Chris were glad of that. They&rsquo;d done all they could think of. He didn&rsquo;t need a change, he didn&rsquo;t want food, didn&rsquo;t need to be burped, rocked, held, or anything else. It was breaking Chris&rsquo;s heart to have to watch and was quite frankly, driving Sebastian slightly mad. But he remained calm. Doing all he could think of. Currently Luca was in his carrier on the floor, still bawling his little hands and legs flailing as he did so. Chris came in from Dodger&rsquo;s morning walk. Unlike usual for the past few days Dodger didn&rsquo;t immediately head outside. This time he slowly and cautiously walked up to the carriage. Chris was about to call him back but Dodger didn&rsquo;t bark or pounce, he instead placed his paw on it and began to rock it slightly. Still crying, Luca opened his eyes. And for the first time in a few hours he paused in his crying. His hands coming out and reaching for the dog. Dodger moves forward. He began licking Luca&rsquo;s head and Luca&rsquo;s little fists fisted themselves in his fur. Dodger pulled away and stopped licking but he sat down, resting his body over the baby carrier completely and just lying there. Chris and Sebastian watched on with awe as Luca slowly stopped crying his cries fading to quiet whimpers and then silence before soft and content cooing sounds replaced them as Luca continued to run his little hands through Dodger&rsquo;s fur. </p><p>&ldquo;Well would you look at that?&rdquo; Chris commented coming over to Sebastian. Sebastian was still shocked himself. </p><p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have tried this three days ago Dodge?&rdquo; He wondered aloud. Chris laughed,  </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Good boy,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That he is,&rdquo; Sebastian said as he sighed. Closing his eyes for a moment and relishing in the silence for the first time in days. </p><p>-</p><p>From then on whenever Luca would start wailing Dodger would come running. If Luca was crying in his crib Dodger would stick a paw or a snout through the bars and as soon as Luca saw him he&rsquo;d begin to calm down. It was almost like magic. When Luca would be playing on his play mat during the day dodger would sit and watch from his spot close by where the sun would shine in through the window. When Luca would push a ball a little out of his reach (before he started crawling) Dodger would be sure to nudge it back before the whimpering started. </p><p>Dodger was taking his duties as big brother very seriously and it warmed Chris&rsquo;s heart the most to see baby and dog bonding so well. </p><p>The only place they drew the line at was when Luca was sleeping at night. Dodger wasn&rsquo;t allowed in the room and there was a baby gate that opened and closed for that reason at Luca&rsquo;s door. Dodger was the best baby monitor there was at night though, because he&rsquo;d be jumping onto Chris and Sebastian&rsquo;s bed before the cries got loud enough to wake them up to let them know Luca was up and needing attention.</p></p>",

You walked\nup to the fountain and stared at the steady stream of water. You were 15\nminutes early. The anticipation of seeing Chris again was getting the best of\nyou. Your heart was beating a thousand times per minute and you had to bite\nyour nails to avoid running your hands through your hair.</p><p><i><b>I feel a little\nnauseous and my hands are shaking</b><b><br/>\nI guess that means you&rsquo;re close by<br/>\nMy throat is getting dry and my heart is racing<br/>\nI haven&rsquo;t been by your side<br/>\nIn a minute, but I think about it sometimes<br/>\nEven though I know it&rsquo;s not so distant<br/>\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it</b></i></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>You\nheard Dodger before you saw him or Chris. He was excitedly barking, running\ntoward you while Chris jogged behind. Chris had a huge smile on his face. He\nwas dressed in jeans and a navy-blue t-shirt. A navy ball cap on his head\npulled down low, covering his eyes. But you couldn\u2019t miss that smile. That million-watt\nsmile. Your own smile burst at the seams. You chuckled as they reached you. You\nwanted to reach for Chris but Dodger bumped you first, putting his paws on your\nknees. Bending forward you rubbed his face and body before crouching down and accepting\nhis kisses. </p><p>Feeling\nbrave all of a sudden. \u201cI guess your not the only one who missed me.\u201d </p><p>Chris\nlowered his head, clearly blushing and then threw it back again. He opened and\nclosed his mouth a few times before he hummed in response.</p><p>You\ntook the leash from Chris\u2019 hand as you usually did. You wanted to reach out and\ntake his hand instead, but since he still hadn\u2019t said anything, it didn\u2019t feel\nright. You started to walk, Chris catching up and walking beside you. Your mind\nflashed back to the last time you were at the park. The arguing, the tears, the\nkiss. Maybe this was all too soon. Maybe Chris was uncomfortable.</p><p><i><b>I know we\ndidn&rsquo;t end it like we&rsquo;re supposed to</b><b><br/>\nAnd now we get a bit tense<br/>\nI wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad\nparts<br/>\nI know we didn&rsquo;t make sense<br/>\nI admit it that I think about it sometimes<br/>\nEven though I know it&rsquo;s not so distant<br/>\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it</b></i></p><p><b>\u00a0</b></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d\nHe places his hand on your shoulder to stop you. \u201cCan we stop for a minute?\u201d His\nhand slowly slides down your arm until it reaches your hand and all you could\ndo is watch. He takes the leash from you and loops it through his own. He\nreturns his hand to yours and holds it. You nod your head, it\u2019s all you can do.\nHe\u2019s holding your hand. This is what you wanted.</p><p><i>Just breathe.\nJust breathe.</i></p><p>\u201cI was\nthinking back to the first time we met. Right here, in this park. I still can\u2019t\nbelieve I yelled at you.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou chuckle. \u201cMe either. Not that it matters,\nbut I had no idea who you were other than this stranger yelling at me. And the\nonly thing I could think about was returning this precious boy to his owner.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p><p>\u201cI need\nto learn how to read a situation better.\u201d He grins. \u201cThis adorable rambling\nwoman threw me through a loop.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmack his hand with your free one. \u201cYou love it!\u201d</p><p>He\nslowly nods his head. \u201cI kind of actually do.\u201d</p><p>You let out a staggered breath and you\nknow he heard it. He squeezes your hand and gives you a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you became one of my closest\nfriends in a short period of time. I hope you being here is you saying you want\nthat again. I miss you sweetheart, and I want us back.\u201d</p><p>Tears prick the corners of your eyes.\nYou try desperately to hold them in, but there\u2019s no use as a couple escape\nflowing down your cheeks. Chris reaches with his free hand to wipe them away\nsoftly with his thumb. Closing your eyes at the touch of his hand, a few more\nescape. You feel lips on your forehead. It\u2019s soft and tender and everything you\nwant. Your eyes shoot open to see Chris slowly pulling away.</p><p>\u201cI do want that.\u201d You say. He smiles\nsoftly. He pulls his hat off and stuffs it in his back pocket. Now you have a\nclear view of those gorgeous eyes and can see unshed tears. \u201cI wanted to stay\nangry at you for so long, but you make that pretty damn hard.\u201d He lets out a\nwatery laugh and you squeeze his hand. You look down at your combined hands,\ntoo afraid to look him in the eyes. \u201cBut you really did hurt me. You can\u2019t do\nthat again. There won\u2019t be another chance. I may seem strong and brave and all\nthat, but I\u2019m not. Not really. I\u2019m still developing this new me and I need\npeople with me who are going to help me flourish, not break me down.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s his turn to let out a ragged\nbreath. You look up to see those unshed tears streaming down his face. Lifting\nyour hand to wipe them away, he grabs it with his free hand and shakes his\nhead. \u201cNever again. I\u2019m a fool. I was an asshole and I\u2019ll never be that way to\nyou again. I need you in my life and I promise to talk to you about what I\u2019m\nfeeling. I should have from the beginning. I think about game night and how I\njust ignored you like you were an extra guest someone just brought.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s rambling and you can\u2019t take it\nanymore. Not that it\u2019s not important, but your heart has already forgiven him\nand you want to move on, but you want more. Your eyes slowly drift to his lips.\nThey\u2019re moving but you can\u2019t concentrate on what they\u2019re saying. You feel bad,\nyou really do. You\u2019ll ask him to repeat it later, but it\u2019s your turn to make\nthat big move. Maybe it\u2019s a mistake. Maybe this will be the end, but it\u2019s what\nyou want and taking chances has been your thing since the day you put your\nhouse up for sale. </p><p>\n\nYou\npull both hands away from his and he looks shocked for a moment. His eyes slowly\nturn to fear and you want nothing more than to soothe him. Slowly your hands\nreach up to his face. Thumbs caressing his cheeks and your fingers brush\nagainst his hairline. He relaxes in your touch and begins to part his lips to\nspeak, but you\u2019re already pulling his face to yours. Holding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour breath, you come closer and closer together\nuntil your lips touch. It\u2019s soft and patient. Even though your holding his\nface, you\u2019re gentle enough that he can easily pull away. But he doesn\u2019t.\nNeither of your lips are moving, they\u2019re just pressed together. The other kiss\nwas hard and hurried. It was pure desperation. This kiss is undemanding and\nsweet. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p>You begin to part your lips and press\nthem against his again. Again, he doesn\u2019t pull away, but he remains still and\nyou don\u2019t know what that means. Those negative thoughts make their way into\nyour brain again. This was a mistake. This isn\u2019t what he wants anymore. Maybe\nhe never did want this and he\u2019s just one of those guys who want what they can\u2019t\nhave. But then you feel his hand on your hip and he\u2019s tugging your body against\nhis. His other hand finds the back of your head, fingers weaving into your\nhair. His mouth parts and you follow suit. Your lips are working in sync and\nyour finally able to release that breath you\u2019d been holding. It comes out as a\nsigh and you feel his grin against your mouth. You suck in a quick breath and\ncapture his lips once more. Your noses are bumping each other but neither of\nyou care as you seem to fit together better the more you continue to kiss.</p><p><i><b>I think\nof the night in the park, it was getting dark</b><b><br/>\nAnd we stayed up for hours<br/>\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time<br/>\nYou clinged to my body like you wanted it\nforever<br/>\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time<br/>\nFor you and I<br/>\nWhat a time, what a time<br/>\nFor you and I </b></i></p><p><b>\u00a0</b></p><p>Out of breath once again, you pull your face\naway slowly and lean your forehead against his. He\u2019s breathing heavy, eyes\nclosed, but all you can see is his flushed cheeks and nose. You lick your lips\nand release your hands from his face settling them on his shoulders, slowly\nsliding them down his chest. One hand still on your hip and the other holding\nyour head. He pulls your lips to his once again for a kiss. It\u2019s short and over\nway too soon, but it\u2019s everything. He initiated it. He wanted it.</p><p>The hand that was holding your head finds its\nway to your other hip and he squeezes it. You\u2019ve both pulled back some so that\nyou can study each other\u2019s faces. His face is still flushed and you don\u2019t doubt\nthat yours is as well. His eyes are shiny but they seem happy. You wonder what\nyou look like and you hope he knows that you are happy as well.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt what you were\nsaying, but I really needed to do that. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He quirks a bashful smile and hums in response.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think I minded that one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, I do miss us, and I do want us back.\nBut..\u201d</p><p>His thumbs are rubbing soothing circles on your\nhips and it\u2019s distracting you in the best way. Your hands are still pressed\nagainst his chest, but they start to ever so slightly move up and down.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d He asks. His voice is soft, barely above\na whisper. The warm glow of the sun on his face and all you can think about is\nhow this strong, handsome man had tears in his eyes and kissed you back.</p><p>\u201cBut, I want more.\u201d He smiles and captures your\nlips with his once again. You pull back and he pouts. You push on his chest and\nhe lets out a chuckle. \u201cI want to try being together, but I don\u2019t want games. I\ndon\u2019t want to see anyone else. I want to give us a real chance. At least that\u2019s\nwhat I want.\u201d </p><p><i>Maybe\nI\u2019ve said too much. Me and my stupid mouth.</i></p><p>\u201cI want that too. I don\u2019t need to see anyone\nelse. But I want to do this right. I want to take you out, wine and dine you.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head and let out a little\ngiggle. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t need all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. Give you pizza and you\u2019re a happy\ngirl. But let me woo you. Please.\u201d</p><p>You smile big and nod. You grab his face once\nagain and kiss his nose. He sighs, pulling back to kiss your forehead. </p><p>\u201cCan you just promise that you won\u2019t shave\nunless its for a movie?\u201d You grab his bearded face with your hand. </p><p>He lets out a big huff of a laugh. \u201cI can\npromise that.\u201d</p><p><i><b>For you\nand I</b><b><br/>\nFor you and I<br/>\nFor you and I<br/>\nWhat a time, what a time for you and I<br/>\nWhat a time for you and I, yeah<br/>\nWhat a time, what a time for you and I</b></i></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWlXU_tkFGl50_6o7QzSDQ\">@lookwhatyoumademequeue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12_H4vOR6Yg6oQ7DIkgl1w\">@the&ndash;blackdahlia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvfaKCaSRME5COH2CQ6-ovA\">@crimeshowtrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6DSHP6G1vpP7li5LmR6CQ\">@flamencodiva</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JrTGsFTiMAO9fKLcL-lvQ\">@cocomel0613</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKdHrEp3ArmzlDlksyCfjEg\">@thefandomzoneisdangerous</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m32gA_h2XVKj-lmfoTHN9nw\">@maddie-laufeyson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfHeOC5QKdkvC5il44pAkvA\">@ly-cia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnPlqAPa7IwakHwqFG5A5Q\">@shameless-pope</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m639hcuSi1UGZxR0GtJGL-A\">@pivans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrbVOq7dBun4OlAYbNJYUA\">@symonlyjen5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQpaow9hD50-M6p3h_4v4A\">@inlovewith3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5sxGUUI1xQXrPWP8Y2Frg\">@fanfiiiiiiics</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNpq6fCujEef3jJxaomtzZA\">@violetadefebrero</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLMzGhcPlZ6nf01yyvdOnOQ\">@not-another-tmblr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXZKEpKJPMCLdMnz0gqteXA\">@thenormreedus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\">@estillion14</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxf4DMfA5y6VQvTy4-MRXA\">@smoothdogsgirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-20P6Yp67PXawboI2n8Ryw\">@chita0027</a></b></p>",

When the memories of your shared\nhome become too much even after two years, you make a drastic change and move\nto California. A new career, a new way of life, and an attractive new friend\nhelp you move on to find the happiness you need. </p><p><b>Pairings: </b>Chris Evans x Reader \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p><b>Warnings for this chapter: \u00a0</b>Fluff! All the fluff! A little cursing. It\u2019s me, you should\nexpect that by now.</p><p><b>A/N:</b> This is a little bit of a different\nchapter and you\u2019ll now understand why I separated it from the first half of\nchapter 17. It\u2019s also longer than I thought it would be, but I\u2019m sure no one is\nmad about that. When I heard the song <b>What\na Time</b> by Julia Michaels (ft. Niall Horan) I knew I had to throw it into\nthis series somewhere as some of the lyrics really relate. Give it a listen.</p><p>Song Lyrics\nare in bold below. I didn\u2019t use the whole song, just the ones that pertained to\nthe story. (They aren\u2019t bold in mobile, I apologize that it looks a jumbled mess)</p><p>You were out\nof the shower and dressed in less than 20 minutes. You threw on a pair jeans\nand a cute wide neck top that exposed one shoulder. Since you had time you\nstyled your hair and put on some light makeup. You put on a pair of sandals,\ngrabbed your key and tucked your phone into your back pocket.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The walk to\nthe park seemed to go a lot faster than it normally did, granted you were\nnormally going for a longer walk that included a trip to the park. You walked\nup to the fountain and stared at the steady stream of water. You were 15\nminutes early. The anticipation of seeing Chris again was getting the best of\nyou. Your heart was beating a thousand times per minute and you had to bite\nyour nails to avoid running your hands through your hair.</p><p><i><b>I feel a little\nnauseous and my hands are shaking</b><b><br>\nI guess that means you\u2019re close by<br>\nMy throat is getting dry and my heart is racing<br>\nI haven\u2019t been by your side<br>\nIn a minute, but I think about it sometimes<br>\nEven though I know it\u2019s not so distant<br>\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it</b></i></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>You\nheard Dodger before you saw him or Chris. He was excitedly barking, running\ntoward you while Chris jogged behind. Chris had a huge smile on his face. He\nwas dressed in jeans and a navy-blue t-shirt. A navy ball cap on his head\npulled down low, covering his eyes. But you couldn\u2019t miss that smile. That million-watt\nsmile. Your own smile burst at the seams. You chuckled as they reached you. You\nwanted to reach for Chris but Dodger bumped you first, putting his paws on your\nknees. Bending forward you rubbed his face and body before crouching down and accepting\nhis kisses. </p><p>Feeling\nbrave all of a sudden. \u201cI guess your not the only one who missed me.\u201d </p><p>Chris\nlowered his head, clearly blushing and then threw it back again. He opened and\nclosed his mouth a few times before he hummed in response.</p><p>You\ntook the leash from Chris\u2019 hand as you usually did. You wanted to reach out and\ntake his hand instead, but since he still hadn\u2019t said anything, it didn\u2019t feel\nright. You started to walk, Chris catching up and walking beside you. Your mind\nflashed back to the last time you were at the park. The arguing, the tears, the\nkiss. Maybe this was all too soon. Maybe Chris was uncomfortable.</p><p><i><b>I know we\ndidn\u2019t end it like we\u2019re supposed to</b><b><br>\nAnd now we get a bit tense<br>\nI wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad\nparts<br>\nI know we didn\u2019t make sense<br>\nI admit it that I think about it sometimes<br>\nEven though I know it\u2019s not so distant<br>\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it</b></i></p><p><b>\u00a0</b></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d\nHe places his hand on your shoulder to stop you. \u201cCan we stop for a minute?\u201d His\nhand slowly slides down your arm until it reaches your hand and all you could\ndo is watch. He takes the leash from you and loops it through his own. He\nreturns his hand to yours and holds it. You nod your head, it\u2019s all you can do.\nHe\u2019s holding your hand. This is what you wanted.</p><p><i>Just breathe.\nJust breathe.</i></p><p>\u201cI was\nthinking back to the first time we met. Right here, in this park. I still can\u2019t\nbelieve I yelled at you.\u201d</p><p>\n\nYou chuckle. \u201cMe either. Not that it matters,\nbut I had no idea who you were other than this stranger yelling at me. And the\nonly thing I could think about was returning this precious boy to his owner.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p><p>\u201cI need\nto learn how to read a situation better.\u201d He grins. \u201cThis adorable rambling\nwoman threw me through a loop.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmack his hand with your free one. \u201cYou love it!\u201d</p><p>He\nslowly nods his head. \u201cI kind of actually do.\u201d</p><p>You let out a staggered breath and you\nknow he heard it. He squeezes your hand and gives you a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you became one of my closest\nfriends in a short period of time. I hope you being here is you saying you want\nthat again. I miss you sweetheart, and I want us back.\u201d</p><p>Tears prick the corners of your eyes.\nYou try desperately to hold them in, but there\u2019s no use as a couple escape\nflowing down your cheeks. Chris reaches with his free hand to wipe them away\nsoftly with his thumb. Closing your eyes at the touch of his hand, a few more\nescape. You feel lips on your forehead. It\u2019s soft and tender and everything you\nwant. Your eyes shoot open to see Chris slowly pulling away.</p><p>\u201cI do want that.\u201d You say. He smiles\nsoftly. He pulls his hat off and stuffs it in his back pocket. Now you have a\nclear view of those gorgeous eyes and can see unshed tears. \u201cI wanted to stay\nangry at you for so long, but you make that pretty damn hard.\u201d He lets out a\nwatery laugh and you squeeze his hand. You look down at your combined hands,\ntoo afraid to look him in the eyes. \u201cBut you really did hurt me. You can\u2019t do\nthat again. There won\u2019t be another chance. I may seem strong and brave and all\nthat, but I\u2019m not. Not really. I\u2019m still developing this new me and I need\npeople with me who are going to help me flourish, not break me down.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s his turn to let out a ragged\nbreath. You look up to see those unshed tears streaming down his face. Lifting\nyour hand to wipe them away, he grabs it with his free hand and shakes his\nhead. \u201cNever again. I\u2019m a fool. I was an asshole and I\u2019ll never be that way to\nyou again. I need you in my life and I promise to talk to you about what I\u2019m\nfeeling. I should have from the beginning. I think about game night and how I\njust ignored you like you were an extra guest someone just brought.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s rambling and you can\u2019t take it\nanymore. Not that it\u2019s not important, but your heart has already forgiven him\nand you want to move on, but you want more.

You pull back and he pouts. You push on his chest and\nhe lets out a chuckle. \u201cI want to try being together, but I don\u2019t want games. I\ndon\u2019t want to see anyone else. I want to give us a real chance. At least that\u2019s\nwhat I want.\u201d </p><p><i>Maybe\nI\u2019ve said too much. Me and my stupid mouth.</i></p><p>\u201cI want that too. I don\u2019t need to see anyone\nelse. But I want to do this right. I want to take you out, wine and dine you.\u201d</p><p>You shake your head and let out a little\ngiggle. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t need all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. Give you pizza and you\u2019re a happy\ngirl. But let me woo you. Please.\u201d</p><p>You smile big and nod. You grab his face once\nagain and kiss his nose. He sighs, pulling back to kiss your forehead. </p><p>\u201cCan you just promise that you won\u2019t shave\nunless its for a movie?\u201d You grab his bearded face with your hand. </p><p>He lets out a big huff of a laugh. \u201cI can\npromise that.\u201d</p><p><i><b>For you\nand I</b><b><br>\nFor you and I<br>\nFor you and I<br>\nWhat a time, what a time for you and I<br>\nWhat a time for you and I, yeah<br>\nWhat a time, what a time for you and I</b></i></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moWlXU_tkFGl50_6o7QzSDQ\">@lookwhatyoumademequeue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12_H4vOR6Yg6oQ7DIkgl1w\">@the\u2013blackdahlia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvfaKCaSRME5COH2CQ6-ovA\">@crimeshowtrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6DSHP6G1vpP7li5LmR6CQ\">@flamencodiva</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1JrTGsFTiMAO9fKLcL-lvQ\">@cocomel0613</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKdHrEp3ArmzlDlksyCfjEg\">@thefandomzoneisdangerous</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m32gA_h2XVKj-lmfoTHN9nw\">@maddie-laufeyson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfHeOC5QKdkvC5il44pAkvA\">@ly-cia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnPlqAPa7IwakHwqFG5A5Q\">@shameless-pope</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAQl1tDxUNP7jYj8APgR9EQ\">@tessvillegas</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m639hcuSi1UGZxR0GtJGL-A\">@pivans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXrbVOq7dBun4OlAYbNJYUA\">@symonlyjen5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYQpaow9hD50-M6p3h_4v4A\">@inlovewith3</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxvEGvtLloe7leiTGiV4zhg\">@humandasaster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QYi0Yga7MBSRVawzYSYaw\">@sleepylunarwolf</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5sxGUUI1xQXrPWP8Y2Frg\">@fanfiiiiiiics</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNpq6fCujEef3jJxaomtzZA\">@violetadefebrero</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLMzGhcPlZ6nf01yyvdOnOQ\">@not-another-tmblr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXZKEpKJPMCLdMnz0gqteXA\">@thenormreedus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJa6FroirmgJOdcmN1nJ7XQ\">@estillion14</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBxf4DMfA5y6VQvTy4-MRXA\">@smoothdogsgirl</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-20P6Yp67PXawboI2n8Ryw\">@chita0027</a></b></p>",

When the memories of your shared\nhome become too much even after two years, you make a drastic change and move\nto California. A new career, a new way of life, and an attractive new friend\nhelp you move on to find the happiness you need. </p><p><b>Pairings: </b>Chris Evans x Reader &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><b>Warnings for this chapter: &nbsp;</b>Fluff! All the fluff! A little cursing. It&rsquo;s me, you should\nexpect that by now.</p><p><b>A/N:</b> This is a little bit of a different\nchapter and you&rsquo;ll now understand why I separated it from the first half of\nchapter 17. It&rsquo;s also longer than I thought it would be, but I&rsquo;m sure no one is\nmad about that. When I heard the song <b>What\na Time</b> by Julia Michaels (ft. Niall Horan) I knew I had to throw it into\nthis series somewhere as some of the lyrics really relate. Give it a listen.</p><p>Song Lyrics\nare in bold below. I didn&rsquo;t use the whole song, just the ones that pertained to\nthe story. (They aren&rsquo;t bold in mobile, I apologize that it looks a jumbled mess)</p><p>You were out\nof the shower and dressed in less than 20 minutes. You threw on a pair jeans\nand a cute wide neck top that exposed one shoulder. Since you had time you\nstyled your hair and put on some light makeup. You put on a pair of sandals,\ngrabbed your key and tucked your phone into your back pocket.</p><p>The walk to\nthe park seemed to go a lot faster than it normally did, granted you were\nnormally going for a longer walk that included a trip to the park. You walked\nup to the fountain and stared at the steady stream of water. You were 15\nminutes early. The anticipation of seeing Chris again was getting the best of\nyou. Your heart was beating a thousand times per minute and you had to bite\nyour nails to avoid running your hands through your hair.</p><p><i><b>I feel a little\nnauseous and my hands are shaking</b><b><br />\nI guess that means you&rsquo;re close by<br />\nMy throat is getting dry and my heart is racing<br />\nI haven&rsquo;t been by your side<br />\nIn a minute, but I think about it sometimes<br />\nEven though I know it&rsquo;s not so distant<br />\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it</b></i></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p>You\nheard Dodger before you saw him or Chris. He was excitedly barking, running\ntoward you while Chris jogged behind. Chris had a huge smile on his face. He\nwas dressed in jeans and a navy-blue t-shirt. A navy ball cap on his head\npulled down low, covering his eyes. But you couldn&rsquo;t miss that smile. That million-watt\nsmile. Your own smile burst at the seams. You chuckled as they reached you. You\nwanted to reach for Chris but Dodger bumped you first, putting his paws on your\nknees. Bending forward you rubbed his face and body before crouching down and accepting\nhis kisses. </p><p>Feeling\nbrave all of a sudden. &ldquo;I guess your not the only one who missed me.&rdquo; </p><p>Chris\nlowered his head, clearly blushing and then threw it back again. He opened and\nclosed his mouth a few times before he hummed in response.</p><p>You\ntook the leash from Chris&rsquo; hand as you usually did. You wanted to reach out and\ntake his hand instead, but since he still hadn&rsquo;t said anything, it didn&rsquo;t feel\nright. You started to walk, Chris catching up and walking beside you. Your mind\nflashed back to the last time you were at the park. The arguing, the tears, the\nkiss. Maybe this was all too soon. Maybe Chris was uncomfortable.</p><p><i><b>I know we\ndidn&rsquo;t end it like we&rsquo;re supposed to</b><b><br />\nAnd now we get a bit tense<br />\nI wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad\nparts<br />\nI know we didn&rsquo;t make sense<br />\nI admit it that I think about it sometimes<br />\nEven though I know it&rsquo;s not so distant<br />\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it</b></i></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;\nHe places his hand on your shoulder to stop you. &ldquo;Can we stop for a minute?&rdquo; His\nhand slowly slides down your arm until it reaches your hand and all you could\ndo is watch. He takes the leash from you and loops it through his own. He\nreturns his hand to yours and holds it. You nod your head, it&rsquo;s all you can do.\nHe&rsquo;s holding your hand. This is what you wanted.</p><p><i>Just breathe.\nJust breathe.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I was\nthinking back to the first time we met. Right here, in this park. I still can&rsquo;t\nbelieve I yelled at you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nYou chuckle. &ldquo;Me either. Not that it matters,\nbut I had no idea who you were other than this stranger yelling at me. And the\nonly thing I could think about was returning this precious boy to his owner.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;I need\nto learn how to read a situation better.&rdquo; He grins. &ldquo;This adorable rambling\nwoman threw me through a loop.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nsmack his hand with your free one. &ldquo;You love it!&rdquo;</p><p>He\nslowly nods his head. &ldquo;I kind of actually do.&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a staggered breath and you\nknow he heard it. He squeezes your hand and gives you a soft smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you became one of my closest\nfriends in a short period of time. I hope you being here is you saying you want\nthat again. I miss you sweetheart, and I want us back.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears prick the corners of your eyes.\nYou try desperately to hold them in, but there&rsquo;s no use as a couple escape\nflowing down your cheeks. Chris reaches with his free hand to wipe them away\nsoftly with his thumb. Closing your eyes at the touch of his hand, a few more\nescape. You feel lips on your forehead. It&rsquo;s soft and tender and everything you\nwant. Your eyes shoot open to see Chris slowly pulling away.</p><p>&ldquo;I do want that.&rdquo; You say. He smiles\nsoftly. He pulls his hat off and stuffs it in his back pocket. Now you have a\nclear view of those gorgeous eyes and can see unshed tears. &ldquo;I wanted to stay\nangry at you for so long, but you make that pretty damn hard.&rdquo; He lets out a\nwatery laugh and you squeeze his hand. You look down at your combined hands,\ntoo afraid to look him in the eyes. &ldquo;But you really did hurt me. You can&rsquo;t do\nthat again. There won&rsquo;t be another chance. I may seem strong and brave and all\nthat, but I&rsquo;m not. Not really. I&rsquo;m still developing this new me and I need\npeople with me who are going to help me flourish, not break me down.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s his turn to let out a ragged\nbreath. You look up to see those unshed tears streaming down his face. Lifting\nyour hand to wipe them away, he grabs it with his free hand and shakes his\nhead. &ldquo;Never again. I&rsquo;m a fool. I was an asshole and I&rsquo;ll never be that way to\nyou again. I need you in my life and I promise to talk to you about what I&rsquo;m\nfeeling. I should have from the beginning. I think about game night and how I\njust ignored you like you were an extra guest someone just brought.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s rambling and you can&rsquo;t take it\nanymore. Not that it&rsquo;s not important, but your heart has already forgiven him\nand you want to move on, but you want more. Your eyes slowly drift to his lips.\nThey&rsquo;re moving but you can&rsquo;t concentrate on what they&rsquo;re saying. You feel bad,\nyou really do. You&rsquo;ll ask him to repeat it later, but it&rsquo;s your turn to make\nthat big move. Maybe it&rsquo;s a mistake. Maybe this will be the end, but it&rsquo;s what\nyou want and taking chances has been your thing since the day you put your\nhouse up for sale. </p><p>\n\nYou\npull both hands away from his and he looks shocked for a moment. His eyes slowly\nturn to fear and you want nothing more than to soothe him. Slowly your hands\nreach up to his face. Thumbs caressing his cheeks and your fingers brush\nagainst his hairline. He relaxes in your touch and begins to part his lips to\nspeak, but you&rsquo;re already pulling his face to yours. Holding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour breath, you come closer and closer together\nuntil your lips touch. It&rsquo;s soft and patient. Even though your holding his\nface, you&rsquo;re gentle enough that he can easily pull away. But he doesn&rsquo;t.\nNeither of your lips are moving, they&rsquo;re just pressed together. The other kiss\nwas hard and hurried. It was pure desperation. This kiss is undemanding and\nsweet. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n</p><p>You begin to part your lips and press\nthem against his again. Again, he doesn&rsquo;t pull away, but he remains still and\nyou don&rsquo;t know what that means. Those negative thoughts make their way into\nyour brain again. This was a mistake. This isn&rsquo;t what he wants anymore. Maybe\nhe never did want this and he&rsquo;s just one of those guys who want what they can&rsquo;t\nhave. But then you feel his hand on your hip and he&rsquo;s tugging your body against\nhis. His other hand finds the back of your head, fingers weaving into your\nhair. His mouth parts and you follow suit. Your lips are working in sync and\nyour finally able to release that breath you&rsquo;d been holding. It comes out as a\nsigh and you feel his grin against your mouth. You suck in a quick breath and\ncapture his lips once more. Your noses are bumping each other but neither of\nyou care as you seem to fit together better the more you continue to kiss.</p><p><i><b>I think\nof the night in the park, it was getting dark</b><b><br />\nAnd we stayed up for hours<br />\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time<br />\nYou clinged to my body like you wanted it\nforever<br />\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time<br />\nFor you and I<br />\nWhat a time, what a time<br />\nFor you and I </b></i></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Out of breath once again, you pull your face\naway slowly and lean your forehead against his. He&rsquo;s breathing heavy, eyes\nclosed, but all you can see is his flushed cheeks and nose. You lick your lips\nand release your hands from his face settling them on his shoulders, slowly\nsliding them down his chest. One hand still on your hip and the other holding\nyour head. He pulls your lips to his once again for a kiss. It&rsquo;s short and over\nway too soon, but it&rsquo;s everything. He initiated it. He wanted it.</p><p>The hand that was holding your head finds its\nway to your other hip and he squeezes it. You&rsquo;ve both pulled back some so that\nyou can study each other&rsquo;s faces. His face is still flushed and you don&rsquo;t doubt\nthat yours is as well. His eyes are shiny but they seem happy. You wonder what\nyou look like and you hope he knows that you are happy as well.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt what you were\nsaying, but I really needed to do that. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>He quirks a bashful smile and hums in response.\n&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think I minded that one bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see, I do miss us, and I do want us back.\nBut..&rdquo;</p><p>His thumbs are rubbing soothing circles on your\nhips and it&rsquo;s distracting you in the best way. Your hands are still pressed\nagainst his chest, but they start to ever so slightly move up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo; He asks. His voice is soft, barely above\na whisper. The warm glow of the sun on his face and all you can think about is\nhow this strong, handsome man had tears in his eyes and kissed you back.</p><p>&ldquo;But, I want more.&rdquo; He smiles and captures your\nlips with his once again. You pull back and he pouts. You push on his chest and\nhe lets out a chuckle. &ldquo;I want to try being together, but I don&rsquo;t want games. I\ndon&rsquo;t want to see anyone else.
