He was staring into it like he was contemplating drowning himself in it rather than drinking it. <br/>&ldquo;Not your scene?&rdquo;<br/>Caleb jumped violently, apparently not having noticed the conspicuous purple tiefling appear next to him but didn&rsquo;t flinch away. Molly made a mental note not to sneak up on the contemplative wizard again.<br/>He made a non-committal sound in his throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit loud for me I&rsquo;m afraid, Mollymauk.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Shame, that. I was hoping to see you let loose a little.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d know how. I never really had an opportunity for\u2026 all that.&rdquo;<br/>Molly tilted his head to get a better look at Caleb, noting\u2014not for the first time\u2014the ever-present dark circles beneath his eyes and tight line of his lips. He got the sense that Caleb looked a good deal older than he actually was. There were more lines in the man&rsquo;s face that he had any right to. Molly knew very little about Caleb, but it was clear to all of them that he had been through a lot, whatever it may have been.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Inexplicably, he felt a strange sense of identity with Caleb. That was rare, for him, since his identity comprised of very little experience. They both seemed lost, in one way or another, both running from a past they&rsquo;d rather not think about. Both avoiding a background they felt betrayed by, unsure whether their actions were their own fault or someone else&rsquo;s. Caleb had never told him anything about his life at all, but Molly could read it in him. In his unsure gaze, in the lines of his posture. In the determined mindset but directionless soul. <br/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Molly began again, &ldquo;Maybe you should take the opportunity now.&rdquo;<br/>Finally, Caleb looked at him. He eyed him from beneath his ginger eyelashes, his hunched shoulders heaved in a sigh before straightening up at last. &ldquo;I should need to be a great deal drunker; I think.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Then let me buy you another drink or two.&rdquo; <br/>Caleb actually looked up at him then, tilted his head and gave a slow, rare smile. A flicker of amusement. Of endearment. &ldquo;Are you trying to seduce me, Mollymauk?&rdquo;<br/>Molly held Caleb&rsquo;s gaze, putting their eyes on a level. &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;Are you seducible?&rdquo;<br/>He scoffed, his drink shifting in his bandage wrapped hands, but he didn&rsquo;t break eye contact. <br/>A sense of triumph stirred in his chest. Caleb deserved a little bit of fun, a little bit of flirting. Just something to get him out of his own head. God knew he was stuck in there far too often. And if he was willing to participate, even better.<br/>&ldquo;That also depends,&rdquo; Caleb replied, and Molly thought he saw a flicker of surprise in the blue eyes of his companion. Good. One should always aim to surprise one&rsquo;s self.<br/>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;On how expensive those drinks are,&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo;<br/>Molly chuckled\u2014it was rare that Caleb told a joke\u2014and took a moment to pull himself away from Caleb&rsquo;s unblinking gaze. There was something a little addictive about those gradual, reluctant smiles and the intensity in those dark blue, thoughtful eyes.\u00a0</p><p>He went to the bar and ordered two of the most expensive drinks he could afford. This, of course, was what money was for. <br/>Returning to Caleb, he was relieved to find that he had not returned to brooding over his ale but had instead drained it. Proudly, Molly presented him with the two drinks, and he gawped at him. &ldquo;Molly, I know what I said, but these are a little too expensive.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he replied, dropping back into the seat beside Caleb. It pleased Molly to hear him use his nickname. He usually used his full name; it came across as something of a linguistic quirk. Molly had to admit; it was very endearing. Even more so when it was eventually foregone in favour of the nickname. It felt like progress.<br/>&ldquo;You take one. I am not such a drinker.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly could not complain about the compromise as he claimed one of the deliciously expensive drinks.</p><p>It was the most comfortable silence that Molly had experienced in a long time, sitting there in the loneliest corner of this busy bar with Caleb Widogast, drinking ridiculously expensive drinks whilst Jester and Beauregard did an exuberant drunken tango around the floor space.</p><p>He watched Caleb with something akin to fascination as he worked on his drink. He was really very handsome underneath the lines and the now mostly vacant layer of grime.</p><p>Caleb didn&rsquo;t seem to mind him watching.</p><p>Ah, yes. A little bit of flirting is good for the soul. Even one that is perhaps a little fractured; in need of attention.<br/>&ldquo;We should join them,&rdquo; He suggested with a grin, glancing over to Jester and Beau, now laughing their heads off as they switched to the clumsiest waltz ever to exist. Caleb huffed something that was very nearly a laugh but wasn&rsquo;t quite.<br/>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see when you reach the bottom of that drink.&rdquo; <br/>Caleb huffed again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly consider myself to be a dancer, my friend.&rdquo;<br/>Molly nearly asked what Caleb did consider himself to be but stopped himself at the last moment. He was sure the answer probably wasn&rsquo;t good, considering what he knew about Caleb, and he wasn&rsquo;t about to consciously bring the mood down. He wanted to distract Caleb from whatever had been watching him back as he&rsquo;d stared into that mug of ale.<br/>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I know how to dance,&rdquo; he corrected, &ldquo;I can certainly waltz better than Jester and Beau.&rdquo; He nodded in their direction. It had been a mistake on Beau&rsquo;s part to convince Jester to drink with her. All the windows crashed open for about the fifth time that evening.<br/>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all coming out now, Widogast.&rdquo; He nudged him with an elbow, sighing dramatically, &ldquo;Never trust a man who can dance.&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;I have trouble believing that you of all people don&rsquo;t know how to dance.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;And did I ever say I was trustworthy?&rdquo;<br/>Caleb really did chuckle then, and it was an awfully out of practice sound. They&rsquo;d have to fix that. Soon.</p><p>They both surveyed their now empty drinks, placed next to each other on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s time to dance, Caleb Widogast.&rdquo; Molly&rsquo;s grin was surely wide enough for the both of them, but Caleb was smiling again, consistently now. Reluctant, but uniquely unburdened. He stood, turning with his arm extended in a sweeping arc of invitation.<br/>&ldquo;Make me,&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Maybe I will,&rdquo; He raised a rather suggestive eyebrow.<br/>&ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;<br/>Ha. The ultimatum. The gauntlet had been thrown.<br/>Mollymauk Tealeaf was going to dance with Caleb Widogast if it was the last thing either of them ever did.<br/>In one graceful swoop, Molly wrapped his arms around Caleb&rsquo;s stick-thin torso and lifted him clean from the bench seat. The man made a strangled cry that wasn&rsquo;t quite a protest and more like another laugh so Molly continued to lift Caleb bodily toward where the girls danced so clumsily.</p><p>The night went on. Caleb and Molly danced with laughter in their heads and hearts and with worries left behind them. They danced with flirtatious remarks and serious undertones. They danced with wandering thoughts and focused minds. They danced with joy. They danced with freedom. They danced with each other. <br/>It felt like a release.</p><p>Molly liked the feel of Caleb&rsquo;s hands in his and Caleb liked the way Molly&hellip; Well. He just liked Molly.</p>",

He was staring into it like he was contemplating drowning himself in it rather than drinking it. <br>\u201cNot your scene?\u201d<br>Caleb jumped violently, apparently not having noticed the conspicuous purple tiefling appear next to him but didn\u2019t flinch away. Molly made a mental note not to sneak up on the contemplative wizard again.<br>He made a non-committal sound in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit loud for me I\u2019m afraid, Mollymauk.\u201d<br>\u201cShame, that. I was hoping to see you let loose a little.\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d know how. I never really had an opportunity for\u2026 all that.\u201d<br>Molly tilted his head to get a better look at Caleb, noting\u2014not for the first time\u2014the ever-present dark circles beneath his eyes and tight line of his lips. He got the sense that Caleb looked a good deal older than he actually was. There were more lines in the man\u2019s face that he had any right to. Molly knew very little about Caleb, but it was clear to all of them that he had been through a lot, whatever it may have been.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Inexplicably, he felt a strange sense of identity with Caleb. That was rare, for him, since his identity comprised of very little experience. They both seemed lost, in one way or another, both running from a past they\u2019d rather not think about. Both avoiding a background they felt betrayed by, unsure whether their actions were their own fault or someone else\u2019s. Caleb had never told him anything about his life at all, but Molly could read it in him. In his unsure gaze, in the lines of his posture. In the determined mindset but directionless soul. <br>\u201cWell,\u201d Molly began again, \u201cMaybe you should take the opportunity now.\u201d<br>Finally, Caleb looked at him. He eyed him from beneath his ginger eyelashes, his hunched shoulders heaved in a sigh before straightening up at last. \u201cI should need to be a great deal drunker; I think.\u201d<br>\u201cThen let me buy you another drink or two.\u201d <br>Caleb actually looked up at him then, tilted his head and gave a slow, rare smile. A flicker of amusement. Of endearment. \u201cAre you trying to seduce me, Mollymauk?\u201d<br>Molly held Caleb\u2019s gaze, putting their eyes on a level. \u201cThat depends,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cAre you seducible?\u201d<br>He scoffed, his drink shifting in his bandage wrapped hands, but he didn\u2019t break eye contact. <br>A sense of triumph stirred in his chest. Caleb deserved a little bit of fun, a little bit of flirting. Just something to get him out of his own head. God knew he was stuck in there far too often. And if he was willing to participate, even better.<br>\u201cThat also depends,\u201d Caleb replied, and Molly thought he saw a flicker of surprise in the blue eyes of his companion. Good. One should always aim to surprise one\u2019s self.<br>\u201cOn what?\u201d<br>\u201cOn how expensive those drinks are,\u201d<br>\u201cFair enough.\u201d<br>Molly chuckled\u2014it was rare that Caleb told a joke\u2014and took a moment to pull himself away from Caleb\u2019s unblinking gaze. There was something a little addictive about those gradual, reluctant smiles and the intensity in those dark blue, thoughtful eyes.\u00a0</p><p>He went to the bar and ordered two of the most expensive drinks he could afford. This, of course, was what money was for. <br>Returning to Caleb, he was relieved to find that he had not returned to brooding over his ale but had instead drained it. Proudly, Molly presented him with the two drinks, and he gawped at him. \u201cMolly, I know what I said, but these are a little too expensive.\u201d<br>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied, dropping back into the seat beside Caleb. It pleased Molly to hear him use his nickname. He usually used his full name; it came across as something of a linguistic quirk. Molly had to admit; it was very endearing. Even more so when it was eventually foregone in favour of the nickname. It felt like progress.<br>\u201cYou take one. I am not such a drinker.\u201d</p><p>Molly could not complain about the compromise as he claimed one of the deliciously expensive drinks.</p><p>It was the most comfortable silence that Molly had experienced in a long time, sitting there in the loneliest corner of this busy bar with Caleb Widogast, drinking ridiculously expensive drinks whilst Jester and Beauregard did an exuberant drunken tango around the floor space.</p><p>He watched Caleb with something akin to fascination as he worked on his drink. He was really very handsome underneath the lines and the now mostly vacant layer of grime.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t seem to mind him watching.</p><p>Ah, yes. A little bit of flirting is good for the soul. Even one that is perhaps a little fractured; in need of attention.<br>\u201cWe should join them,\u201d He suggested with a grin, glancing over to Jester and Beau, now laughing their heads off as they switched to the clumsiest waltz ever to exist. Caleb huffed something that was very nearly a laugh but wasn\u2019t quite.<br>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d<br>\u201cWe\u2019ll see when you reach the bottom of that drink.\u201d <br>Caleb huffed again. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly consider myself to be a dancer, my friend.\u201d<br>Molly nearly asked what Caleb did consider himself to be but stopped himself at the last moment. He was sure the answer probably wasn\u2019t good, considering what he knew about Caleb, and he wasn\u2019t about to consciously bring the mood down. He wanted to distract Caleb from whatever had been watching him back as he\u2019d stared into that mug of ale.<br>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how?\u201d<br>\u201cI know how to dance,\u201d he corrected, \u201cI can certainly waltz better than Jester and Beau.\u201d He nodded in their direction. It had been a mistake on Beau\u2019s part to convince Jester to drink with her. All the windows crashed open for about the fifth time that evening.<br>\u201cOh, it\u2019s all coming out now, Widogast.\u201d He nudged him with an elbow, sighing dramatically, \u201cNever trust a man who can dance.\u201d <br>\u201cI have trouble believing that you of all people don\u2019t know how to dance.\u201d<br>\u201cAnd did I ever say I was trustworthy?\u201d<br>Caleb really did chuckle then, and it was an awfully out of practice sound. They\u2019d have to fix that. Soon.</p><p>They both surveyed their now empty drinks, placed next to each other on the table.</p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s time to dance, Caleb Widogast.\u201d Molly\u2019s grin was surely wide enough for the both of them, but Caleb was smiling again, consistently now. Reluctant, but uniquely unburdened. He stood, turning with his arm extended in a sweeping arc of invitation.<br>\u201cMake me,\u201d<br>\u201cMaybe I will,\u201d He raised a rather suggestive eyebrow.<br>\u201cProve it.\u201d<br>Ha. The ultimatum. The gauntlet had been thrown.<br>Mollymauk Tealeaf was going to dance with Caleb Widogast if it was the last thing either of them ever did.<br>In one graceful swoop, Molly wrapped his arms around Caleb\u2019s stick-thin torso and lifted him clean from the bench seat. The man made a strangled cry that wasn\u2019t quite a protest and more like another laugh so Molly continued to lift Caleb bodily toward where the girls danced so clumsily.</p><p>The night went on. Caleb and Molly danced with laughter in their heads and hearts and with worries left behind them. They danced with flirtatious remarks and serious undertones. They danced with wandering thoughts and focused minds. They danced with joy. They danced with freedom. They danced with each other. <br>It felt like a release.</p><p>Molly liked the feel of Caleb\u2019s hands in his and Caleb liked the way Molly\u2026 Well. He just liked Molly.</p></p>",
