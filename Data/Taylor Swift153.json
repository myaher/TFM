as he licked at her core twirling his tongue around her centre eating every bit of her.</p><p><br></p><p>He pressed a strong kiss on her uterus and kept pecking until he got to her folds his teeth lightly grazed over them sending Taylor into a few screams.He raised his head looking at the beautiful sight in frount of him.Taylor was in complete pleasure before she came joe handed her the condom \u2018you wanna put it princess?\u2019 Knowing she would \u2018of course\u2019 she said smiling ear to ear.</p><p><br></p><p>Once on she pumped him a few times ,he entered slowly yet roughly Taylor

hastily.The pair were moaning lustily,filling the room with their sounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Their orgasms were more than loud Taylor\u2019s screams filled the room as joe finished her.He took off his condom throwing it into the garbish can beside the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>The pair stared into one another\u2019s eyes lustfily   Before they could finish they could hear the sound of a small hand knocking on the door \u2018what do we do\u2019 Taylor whispered in a panicked tone \u2018get under the bed\u2019 he said while putting his boxers back on.</p><p><br></p><p>She squeezed her self under the small crack under the bed and hoped for the best.Joe jogged over to the door to unlock it.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2018Daddy the movie finished and we\u2019re hungry\u2019 Ava said excitedly

Sighed in relief as he accomplished not waking her.she was happy and sleeping so peacefully and he found her so pretty especially when she smiles throughout her sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>He took this free time upon himself to find a babysitter for the night they had never gone on a \u2018proper\u2019 date infact hasn\u2019t gone on one at  all.he dialled his mother\u2019s number who just landed for a simple visit ,he hoped that she would be able to look after the girls for the night.</p><p><br></p><p>The call with his mother was successful she was ecstatic to watch the girls for a few hours.She also requested to meet Taylor whom he knew wouldnt want to do so this early into a relationship.he decided he would need to ask her in advanced as he already learnt she hates procrastination and leaving things last minute.he sat on the edge of his bed and put an arm around sleepy state Taylor \u2018my mum would love to look after the girls but she also wants to meet you\u2019</p><p><br></p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck securely locking her body too his.\u2019what time are we going out and where\u2019 she replied still struggling to wake up \u2018I dont know love,I wanted you too choose a resturant with me as I don\u2019t know what you like to eat and my mother is coming over for a cup of tea in half an hour so I suggest we put our clothes on\u2019 he replied caressing her soft cheeks with his slender veiny hands.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2018Umm I don\u2019t have any clothes apart from my dirty ones from yesterday nor a hairbrush and makeup\u2019 she said stretching her arms behind her head ,trying to fall out of her sleepy state \u2018I had my assistant get everything you need she should have been here 5 minutes ago so any minute now plus you don\u2019t even need makeup anyway you so fucking gorgeous \u2019.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2018Alright and back to the food thing could you bring up some possible places while I get ready when my stuff arrives\u2019. She said whilst lovingly touching his chin.</p><p><br></p><p>\u2018Oh love just in time your stuffs arrived\u2019 Joe replied chucking his phone onto the bed and running down stairs.Taylor was more than nervous to meet Joes mother they hadn\u2019t even started dating yet.All she knew was that joe had a very protective mother whom loved him very much.she walked into the bathroom and stripped off her clothes to step into the hot shower.The steamy water beamed down causing her body so appear red.She relaxed under the hot sensation and grabbed some of joes body wash,she rubbed it over her smooth skin she devoured his smell and now could smell the same.Hoping he didn\u2019t mind she also grabbed some of his 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner and massaged it into her hair she rinsed the rest out and turned the shower off. </p><p><br></p><p>She wrapped the towel around her body as if it was a dress she used her free hand to open the door and ask for her things.\u2019joe could I have my

you like I find it so hot of you to do so\u2019 she smiled softly at his reply  \u2018you need to get ready too bud your also just in a towel\u2019 he placed a kiss on her temple before entering his closet.</p><p><br></p><p>Taylor quickly brushed her teeth and rinsed with mouthwash ,she pulled her hairbrush out of her bag and brushed out her golden locks and blow dried them and decided to leave her hair down the way joe said he adored it.As she put on her baby blue romper with flower patterns she heard a car pull up to the house she heard joe rush downstairs and decided to look outside.</p><p><br></p><p>She later through the window and saw Joe exchange a hug with a tall women in a flowery dress and short brown hair Who  He walked inside with.Taylors heart beated rapidly she

than nervous to meet Joes mother they hadn\u2019t even started dating yet.All she knew was that joe had a very protective mother whom loved him very much.she walked into the bathroom and stripped off her clothes to step into the hot shower.The steamy water beamed down causing her body so appear red.She relaxed under the hot sensation and grabbed some of joes body wash,she rubbed it over her smooth

closet.</p><p><br></p><p>Taylor quickly brushed her teeth and rinsed with mouthwash ,she pulled her hairbrush out of her bag and brushed out her golden locks and blow dried them and decided to leave her hair down the way joe said he adored it.As she put on her baby blue romper with flower patterns she heard a car pull up to the house she heard joe rush downstairs and decided to look outside.</p><p><br></p><p>She later through the window and saw Joe exchange a hug with a tall women in a flowery dress and short brown hair Who  He walked inside with.Taylors heart beated rapidly she didn\u2019t realise the time and how fast it went Joes mother was already here.She applied a touch of red lipstick to complete the look.she has some donut socks on but didn\u2019t think anyone would be judgemental of it.</p><p><br></p><p>She walked down stairs and walked towards the island in the kitchen where joe was cleaning up juice the kids had spilt everywhere.She sat down next to joes mother \u2018hello\u2019 Taylor said with a friendly smile \u2018hi ,you must be Taylor I\u2019m Elizabeth ,I\u2019ve heard many great things about you\u2019 </p><p> \u2018Really\u2019 she said taking

possible</p><p><br></p><p>\u2018Oh you too are so cute\u2019 Elizabeth said smiling while placing Ava on her lap pulling her in for a cuddle.\u2019Taylor why don\u2019t you go up stairs and look at some restaurants while I catch up with my mother\u2019 Joe whispered while caressing her soft cheeks with his slender thumb.\u2019yes\u2019 she replied quietly and walked off upstairs.</p><p><br></p><p>She turned on the light in his mess of an office and sat down in his leather chair his computer was surprisingly left open.She felt like takeaways or a home cooked meal but after all he did have his mother looking after the kids ,something Taylor hasn\u2019t had in quite a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>she choose out a Chinese restaurant and went into Joes reminders to set one for dinner before she could set one at the top of his urgent reminders had one labeled \u201cSnapchat abby\u2764\ufe0f\u201d  her heart started to sink \u2018who\u2019s abby\u2019.She muttered to herself only to see joe and Elizabeth walk into the room \u2018found somewhere to eat??\u2019 He said while leaning over Taylor\u2019s shoulder \u2018I don\u2019t feel to well I think I need to go home\u2019 she replied her voice breaking as she did \u2018mum could you go downstairs for a minute\u2019 joe asked his mother who was in complete worry and confusion </p><p>\u2018Of course\u2019 she replied and sped out of the room. </p><p><br></p><p>\u2018Love what\u2019s the sudden change one minute ago you couldn\u2019t wait to go out ,and now you dread too\u2019 he asked whilst starting to massage her shoulders slowly Taylor resisted the touch and squirmed to the side.</p><p>\u2018 I said I don\u2019t feel well now leave me alone and stop touching me your not even my boyfriend\u2019.She said storming off into the bathroom ,slamming the doors as she did so .Joe sat down in the chair Taylor was previously in ,he didn\u2019t know where he went wrong.She was right he wasn\u2019t Taylor\u2019s boyfriend but it felt like it the long nights full of flirtatious text and calls  the sex the kisses and hugs the hours he spent cuddling and assuring Taylor everything would be ok.He wanted to help her feel loved and feel appreciated but couldn\u2019t as she needed to cool off.Joes mother sat down beside him hanging an arm around his shoulder \u2018hey girls act up all the time I\u2019m sure in 10 minutes she\u2019ll feel better she\u2019s probably just got nervous butterflies or maybe on her period whatever it is she loves you Joe the smile on her face whenever you look at her is pure and rare\u2019 </p></p>",

he placed a kiss on her temple before entering his closet.</p><p><br /></p><p>Taylor quickly brushed her teeth and rinsed with mouthwash ,she pulled her hairbrush out of her bag and brushed out her golden locks and blow dried them and decided to leave her hair down the way joe said he adored it.As she put on her baby blue romper with flower patterns she heard a car pull up to the house she heard joe rush downstairs and decided to look outside.</p><p><br /></p><p>She later through the window and saw Joe exchange a hug with a tall women in a flowery dress and short brown hair Who  He walked inside with.Taylors heart beated rapidly she didn&rsquo;t realise the time and how fast it went Joes mother was already here.She applied a touch of red lipstick to complete the look.she has some donut socks on but didn&rsquo;t think anyone would be judgemental of it.</p><p><br /></p><p>She walked down stairs and walked towards the island in the kitchen where joe was cleaning up juice the kids had spilt everywhere.She sat down next to joes mother &lsquo;hello&rsquo; Taylor said with a friendly smile &lsquo;hi ,you must be Taylor I&rsquo;m Elizabeth ,I&rsquo;ve heard many great things about you&rsquo; </p><p> &lsquo;Really&rsquo; she said taking a sip of the tea joe just placed on the counter for them both.&rsquo;Joe really adores you love ,he&rsquo;s so in love with you he thinks your the best person he&rsquo;s ever met&rsquo; Taylor grinned widely whilst Joe attempted to stop his mother from rambling on about his love for her constantly and annoyingly kept &lsquo;muuuuuummmm&rsquo; ing Elizabeth.In the most boyish way possible</p><p><br /></p><p>&lsquo;Oh you too are so cute&rsquo; Elizabeth said smiling while placing Ava on her lap pulling her in for a cuddle.&rsquo;Taylor why don&rsquo;t you go up stairs and look at some restaurants while I catch up with my mother&rsquo; Joe whispered while caressing her soft cheeks with his slender thumb.&rsquo;yes&rsquo; she replied quietly and walked off upstairs.</p><p><br /></p><p>She turned on the light in his mess of an office and sat down in his leather chair his computer was surprisingly left open.She felt like takeaways or a home cooked meal but after all he did have his mother looking after the kids ,something Taylor hasn&rsquo;t had in quite a long time.</p><p><br /></p><p>she choose out a Chinese restaurant and went into Joes reminders to set one for dinner before she could set one at the top of his urgent reminders had one labeled &ldquo;Snapchat abby&#10084;&#65039;&rdquo;  her heart started to sink &lsquo;who&rsquo;s abby&rsquo;.She muttered to herself only to see joe and Elizabeth walk into the room &lsquo;found somewhere to eat??&rsquo; He said while leaning over Taylor&rsquo;s shoulder &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel to well I think I need to go home&rsquo; she replied her voice breaking as she did &lsquo;mum could you go downstairs for a minute&rsquo; joe asked his mother who was in complete worry and confusion </p><p>&lsquo;Of course&rsquo; she replied and sped out of the room. </p><p><br /></p><p>&lsquo;Love what&rsquo;s the sudden change one minute ago you couldn&rsquo;t wait to go out ,and now you dread too&rsquo; he asked whilst starting to massage her shoulders slowly Taylor resisted the touch and squirmed to the side.</p><p>&lsquo; I said I don&rsquo;t feel well now leave me alone and stop touching me your not even my boyfriend&rsquo;.She said storming off into the bathroom ,slamming the doors as she did so .Joe sat down in the chair Taylor was previously in ,he didn&rsquo;t know where he went wrong.She was right he wasn&rsquo;t Taylor&rsquo;s boyfriend but it felt like it the long nights full of flirtatious text and calls  the sex the kisses and hugs the hours he spent cuddling and assuring Taylor everything would be ok.He wanted to help her feel loved and feel appreciated but couldn&rsquo;t as she needed to cool off.Joes mother sat down beside him hanging an arm around his shoulder &lsquo;hey girls act up all the time I&rsquo;m sure in 10 minutes she&rsquo;ll feel better she&rsquo;s probably just got nervous butterflies or maybe on her period whatever it is she loves you Joe the smile on her face whenever you look at her is pure and rare&rsquo; </p></p>",
