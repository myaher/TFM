Despite all his enhancements and the fact that his body ran hotter than anyone else\u2019s in the Commandos, he was still freezing. A few paces ahead of him, his men were all huddled around the pathetic fire, covered in ratty blankets and whatever coats they could find in an attempt to keep warm. They were all talking and laughing, though- probably because they knew they were getting a week\u2019s leave back to the US soon. The hard times were far from over, but if they survived the night, they could at least get a break from it all.</p><p>Steve was glad. The Commandos had all been working themselves to the bone in the hunt for the Red Skull recently- they deserved a rest.\u00a0</p><p>Shuffling a little and pulling out the yellowed envelope with shaking hands, he smiled to himself and let his fingers trace over his own name,Tony\u2019s familiar scrawl already warming a place in his chest up. It was the reason he\u2019d tucked himself away into a little corner of the trench, rather than warm himself with the rest of the team. Letters from home were few and far between, and when they <i>did </i>come, Steve wanted to take the proper time to read it in private. It was silly, but this sometimes felt like the only part of himself that was wholly his own- Tony\u2019s letter and Tony\u2019s words, just for him and no-one else. Not a lot of things were private in the army (he was almost certain the rest of the team already knew he and Tony weren\u2019t the\u00a0\u2018good friends\u2019 Steve always said they were, although they never commented) , but Steve wanted to keep these moments to himself, if he could.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He ripped the envelope open and unfolded the letter. It had dampened on the journey and some of the words were smudged, but it was still legible. Still Tony\u2019s.</p><!-- more --><p><i>Steve,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I\u2019d like to start off by saying I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to forgive you for breaking the sonic transmitter I\u2019d got the boys to send over to you JUST LAST MONTH. I worked on that for hours, you clumsy lug, and then you go and break it on it\u2019s first time out? Poor baby, I got it back in about a hundred different pieces! Even after specifically designing it for durable use! What the hell did you do, throw it off a damn cliff?</i></p><p>Steve chuckled to himself, feeling sheepish as he remembered. In his defence, it hadn\u2019t been a cliff exactly- a very busy intersection would be a better way of describing it. It had worked a treat whilst it had been in one piece though. He\u2019d thank Tony for that later.</p><p><i>Anyway- expensive inventions aside, let\u2019s get on to the more important matters. Like when the hell you\u2019re getting home. The higher-ups are being very vague with me, but they keep saying it\u2019s soon. They better be telling the truth- I miss you. My brain doesn\u2019t work right when you\u2019re not here. It\u2019s been five months, Steve. Five! I had a brief panic about whether or not you even remembered how handsome my face was, so I\u2019ve sent a picture along in the envelope, just in case.\u00a0</i></p><p>Steve raised his eyebrows and huffed in amusement, looking back down at the envelope he\u2019d placed on his lap. Picking it up again, he tipped it upside down and then caught the small rectangular piece of paper that fluttered from the folds. He felt his heart speed up just a few beats with anticipation- it had been seven months, dammit, he was excited. Not that Tony\u2019s face wasn\u2019t still as crystal clear in his head as the day they\u2019d first met, of course, but still. He looked at it intently, making sure his fingertips were clean before he traced them delicately over the sepia smile stretched over Tony\u2019s beautiful face. His hair had grown out while Steve had been gone. It curled around at the bottom of his neck now, stuck up in tufts at the front of his face, every bit as wild and beautiful as Tony himself was. A storm trapped inside a body. Steve swallowed the lump in his throat and took a small breath in as he shut his eyes and etched the image into his memory. Soon. Soon, he\u2019d be able to touch in real life. Hold Tony\u2019s face between his hands and relearn all the parts of him that had faded with their time apart.\u00a0</p><p>Carefully, delicately, Steve tucked the photograph into the pocket of his coat, patting it once before returning back to the letter itself, the sound of Tony\u2019s voice speaking up in his head as he read each word the man had written for him.</p><p><i>I\u2019m doing okay. Still inventing, still trying to win the war through out-sciencing the Nazis. Please come home soon, though. If you can. It\u2019s selfish, but it\u2019s fucking lonely here. And I hate thinking about you out on the Western Front right now. I swear, you better be using that insulation blanket I sent over right now, or I\u2019m going to get a plane over there and throttle you. I really just&hellip; hate the thought of you being cold. You shouldn\u2019t be cold. You should be here, with me.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>But whatever. There\u2019s a war on, a fight for our freedom, yadda yadda. Guess I can be a grown-up about it for now. Just come home to me soon, darling. Please. I miss your smile. Among other things.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>In the mean-time, please continue fighting fascism\u00a0and being attractively heroic. I\u2019ll just pine quietly for you like every other desperate girlfriend and wife around me is, it\u2019s fine. Remember not to die. And tie your shoelaces before you go into No-Man\u2019s Land. And try to eat something that resembles a fruit, I know you\u2019re all muscly and super-soldiery but you still need your minerals, alright? Promise? I\u2019m going to assume you just promised.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I love you more than anything. I want you to know that, right down to your bones. Carry that with you on the battlefield, okay? I\u2019ll be your good luck charm.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Yours always, Tony.</i></p><p>Steve got to the end, looking down at the inked words and imagining Tony writing them out, a week or two ago maybe, hunched over his desk and running a hand anxiously through his hair as he wondered what he should put. There were small grease-stains around the edges, so maybe he\u2019d just finished working. And maybe once he\u2019d signed his name at the bottom. he\u2019d done exactly what Steve was doing now, and imagining him receiving it in seven days\u2019 time.\u00a0</p><p>God, Steve couldn\u2019t wait to go home to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot long now,\u201d someone said in front of him, and he jumped in surprise, looking up at Bucky as the man smiled gently down at him. He was the only one who Steve had explicitly told about Tony. He\u2019d been there right from the beginning, and treated Tony like a little brother.\u00a0\u201cI know it must be hard, but you\u2019ll be home soon. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a great reunion that I will make sure to be far, far away from.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve went pink and looked down, folding the papers up carefully and tucking them into his pocket too.\u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d he murmured, thinking of how it was going to feel to be able to touch a body that wasn\u2019t caked in mud or blood or dust,\u00a0or an enemy trying to kill him. To touch someone whose skin was warm, and full of care.\u00a0</p><p>He looked up toward the starless sky, tinged with shell-fire fog and filled with the stink of death and decay, and thought of home as the icy cold dug into his exposed skin.\u00a0</p><p>Soon.</p><p>-</p><hr><p><i>Like my work?

Despite all his enhancements and the fact that his body ran hotter than anyone else\u2019s in the Commandos, he was still freezing. A few paces ahead of him, his men were all huddled around the pathetic fire, covered in ratty blankets and whatever coats they could find in an attempt to keep warm. They were all talking and laughing, though- probably because they knew they were getting a week\u2019s leave back to the US soon. The hard times were far from over, but if they survived the night, they could at least get a break from it all.</p><p>Steve was glad.

It was the reason he\u2019d tucked himself away into a little corner of the trench, rather than warm himself with the rest of the team. Letters from home were few and far between, and when they <i>did </i>come, Steve wanted to take the proper time to read it in private. It was silly, but this sometimes felt like the only part of himself that was wholly his own- Tony\u2019s letter and Tony\u2019s words, just for him and no-one else. Not a lot of things were private in the army (he was almost certain the rest of the team already knew he and Tony weren\u2019t the\u00a0\u2018good friends\u2019 Steve always said they were, although they never commented) , but Steve wanted to keep these moments to himself, if he could.\u00a0<br></p><p>He ripped the envelope open and unfolded the letter. It had dampened on the journey and some of the words were smudged, but it was still legible. Still Tony\u2019s.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Steve,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I\u2019d like to start off by saying I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to forgive you for breaking the sonic transmitter I\u2019d got the boys to send over to you JUST LAST MONTH. I worked on that for hours, you clumsy lug, and then you go and break it on it\u2019s first time out? Poor baby, I got it back in about a hundred different pieces! Even after specifically designing it for durable use! What the hell did you do, throw it off a damn cliff?</i></p><p>Steve chuckled to himself, feeling sheepish as he remembered. In his defence, it hadn\u2019t been a cliff exactly- a very busy intersection would be a better way of describing it. It had worked a treat whilst it had been in one piece though. He\u2019d thank Tony for that later.</p><p><i>Anyway- expensive inventions aside, let\u2019s get on to the more important matters. Like when the hell you\u2019re getting home. The higher-ups are being very vague with me, but they keep saying it\u2019s soon. They better be telling the truth- I miss you. My brain doesn\u2019t work right when you\u2019re not here. It\u2019s been five months, Steve. Five! I had a brief panic about whether or not you even remembered how handsome my face was, so I\u2019ve sent a picture along in the envelope, just in case.\u00a0</i></p><p>Steve raised his eyebrows and huffed in amusement, looking back down at the envelope he\u2019d placed on his lap. Picking it up again, he tipped it upside down and then caught the small rectangular piece of paper that fluttered from the folds. He felt his heart speed up just a few beats with anticipation- it had been seven months, dammit, he was excited. Not that Tony\u2019s face wasn\u2019t still as crystal clear in his head as the day they\u2019d first met, of course, but still. He looked at it intently, making sure his fingertips were clean before he traced them delicately over the sepia smile stretched over Tony\u2019s beautiful face. His hair had grown out while Steve had been gone. It curled around at the bottom of his neck now, stuck up in tufts at the front of his face, every bit as wild and beautiful as Tony himself was. A storm trapped inside a body. Steve swallowed the lump in his throat and took a small breath in as he shut his eyes and etched the image into his memory. Soon. Soon, he\u2019d be able to touch in real life. Hold Tony\u2019s face between his hands and relearn all the parts of him that had faded with their time apart.\u00a0</p><p>Carefully, delicately, Steve tucked the photograph into the pocket of his coat, patting it once before returning back to the letter itself, the sound of Tony\u2019s voice speaking up in his head as he read each word the man had written for him.</p><p><i>I\u2019m doing okay. Still inventing, still trying to win the war through out-sciencing the Nazis. Please come home soon, though. If you can. It\u2019s selfish, but it\u2019s fucking lonely here. And I hate thinking about you out on the Western Front right now. I swear, you better be using that insulation blanket I sent over right now, or I\u2019m going to get a plane over there and throttle you. I really just\u2026 hate the thought of you being cold. You shouldn\u2019t be cold. You should be here, with me.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>But whatever. There\u2019s a war on, a fight for our freedom, yadda yadda. Guess I can be a grown-up about it for now. Just come home to me soon, darling. Please. I miss your smile. Among other things.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>In the mean-time, please continue fighting fascism\u00a0and being attractively heroic. I\u2019ll just pine quietly for you like every other desperate girlfriend and wife around me is, it\u2019s fine. Remember not to die. And tie your shoelaces before you go into No-Man\u2019s Land. And try to eat something that resembles a fruit, I know you\u2019re all muscly and super-soldiery but you still need your minerals, alright? Promise?

I\u2019ll be your good luck charm.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Yours always, Tony.</i></p><p>Steve got to the end, looking down at the inked words and imagining Tony writing them out, a week or two ago maybe, hunched over his desk and running a hand anxiously through his hair as he wondered what he should put. There were small grease-stains around the edges, so maybe he\u2019d just finished working. And maybe once he\u2019d signed his name at the bottom. he\u2019d done exactly what Steve was doing now, and imagining him receiving it in seven days\u2019 time.\u00a0</p><p>God, Steve couldn\u2019t wait to go home to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot long now,\u201d someone said in front of him, and he jumped in surprise, looking up at Bucky as the man smiled gently down at him.
