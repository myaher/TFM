One more chapter after this and the epilogue! <!-- more --></p><p>Phil misses work the next few days and he doesn\u2019t bother to tell anyone else why. Martyn tries to come and visit him but when Martyn rings his doorbell, Phil pretends he isn\u2019t home and just lays on the couch. Spike whimpers a bit and tries to scratch at the door but because Martyn doesn\u2019t have his key anymore to the flat, he can\u2019t come in.\u00a0</p><p>Martyn texts him later that day and asks him where he went and Phil just said he needed to go for a breather. It was all he\u2019s said to anyone since his last Skype call with Dan.\u00a0</p><p>He was hurt, deeply so. His heart felt shattered and his brain like mush. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he could move past any of this. In the four short months that he\u2019s grown to know who Dan was, nothing has felt like this.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s been through break ups. He\u2019s been through bad relationships. But no break up has hurt as bad as Dan telling him that he thinks they should take a break. What happened to Dan promising him that they wouldn\u2019t give up on each other and he made the promise back? Did the promise fall on deaf ears? Did Dan not really mean anything that he said?\u00a0</p><p>Phil doesn\u2019t want to believe that\u2019s the case.\u00a0</p><p>Per Dan\u2019s request, he hasn\u2019t tried to get ahold of him. He also took the initiative to delete his social media apps off from his phone so that why he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to check Dan\u2019s Twitter or Instagram and see how he\u2019s doing. The news has been quiet lately, not mentioning Dan\u2019s name. And Phil guesses that he\u2019s grateful for that. But in a selfish way, he wishes that some entertainment news site would talk about Dan so he could know what Dan was doing.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s four days later when Phil decides that he needs to actually do something. He needs to get off his arse and actually start living again. He\u2019s sat in his flat, wallowing in his own misery and barely showering. Even Spike has begun to find it a bit weird that Phil hasn\u2019t taken him for a proper walk to the park. He can tell by Spike\u2019s anxious prancing around the flat.\u00a0</p><p>He showers That\u2019s morning, dresses in a pair of his black jeans and his black shirt with the word vibes on it to add a bit of color to his dark mind. He puts in contacts instead of wearing his glasses and he styles his hair. Already, just by doing that, he feels a bit better.\u00a0</p><p>But instead of going out, he sets up behind a camera and puts some lights on him and he just sits down and takes a breath. He needs to do this. Even if he never posts the video, he needs to just let everything go.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019s going to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey everyone.\u201d He begins, voice wavering a bit. \u201cToday, I\u2019m making a video not as amazingphil but as Phil Lester. There is a lot I need to get off from my chest because of recent events and this is me doing so. In January of this year, I met Daniel Howell on the set of the new film he was working on. As some of you know, I work for the BBC as a graphic designer and I often am working in the offices doing advertising and posters and websites. But enough of that. I met Dan when I was told I was going to be an extra on the set of the film. I thought it was stupid. I was and at the BBC for bringing me in on what would be my day off to film as some extra in some big pretentious movie stars film. But that actually wasn\u2019t it at all. I met Dan on the set and my life completely changed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil took a breath and then let it out slowly as he tried to find his composure again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I exchanged numbers and he asked me to do a favor for him by showing him around London. I thought really nothing of it. He was asking as if he was a friend and I\u2019m not someone to turn down a friends request. So I went around with him in London then the paparazzi flooded us at the eye and that was when everyone saw us for the first time. At that time in our lives, we were just budding friends. We were nothing more.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil looked up his ceiling in an attempt to ground himself. He couldn\u2019t believe he was telling all of this right now to a camera but it also felt so good to just spew all of this out when he\u2019s had to hide it for so long.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I kept in contact and when he came to London a short time later, he stayed at my flat with me and I think that was when I realized he was someone I wanted to spend more time with and get to know better. So we agreed for me to come to Los Angeles to spend a week with him and I did. And it was then during that time that we solidified our relationship.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil felt his eyes prick a bit with tears as he took in a deep shuddering breath, promising to edit it out later if he ever does actually edit this video to be posted later. All he can think of is him in Dan in LA, kissing in Dan\u2019s bed and then fucking just a short time later. Phil\u2019s spins tingles as he thinks about what it was like to have sex with Dan for the first time and how amazing it had felt for him. How much love he had felt being poured from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe told each other that we were together and we wanted to be together but then the paparazzi got in our way and we couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Our relationship was going so well but then the fucking paparazzi came out and they followed us. They followed me around London where I once lived without worry. They followed Dan around Los Angeles when he isn\u2019t comfortable with it. And they ruined us. The ruined us because they caught an intimate moment between us at my flat and completely breached our privacy. And I know people are probably going to be like \u201cbut Phil, you\u2019re airing everything out into the open now\u201d and my answer to that is that I\u2019m doing it on my own terms. Dan and I wanted to come out on our own terms and it got ripped away from us by some selfish pricks we wanted it make quick money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tears are rolling freely down Phil\u2019s cheeks now. He reaches up and wipes them away as best he can but it looks like he just smeared them over his cheeks and not really wiped them away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I are taking a break now because of what the paparazzi did. Because we need to figure out how to move on with our relationship aired out because we were ready. And no one will understand the pain that I\u2019m feeling right now to love someone so damn much and have him be ripped away from me because of people who have no care for other people\u2019s privacy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A sob rips from his throat and he lurches forward as he buries his head into his hands and lets out all of the emotions that he has been feeling and bottling up these last few days. He\u2019s angry. And he\u2019s sad. And frankly, he kind of wants to be out for blood right now, yelling at people. But he\u2019s trying to keep composure and it\u2019s getting more and more difficult.\u00a0</p><p>When his tears dry up a bit and he lets himself settle, he takes a few deep breaths and then speaks again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Dan will ever see this video. For all I know, this video could separate us further than we already are. But if he is, I wanted to speak to him directly and just say some things. Dan, I love you. I know I didn\u2019t say it to you when you told me you loved me in Los Angels but I\u2019m saying it now. I love you so much and I don\u2019t want to lose you. I know you probably didn\u2019t want a video like this just airing everything out but please, please understand me. I want to be able to be with you, completely and unabashedly. I want to wake up next to you again and kiss you and, sorry for being vulgar, but I want to keep making love with you. I want to be with you&hellip;.I love you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil stands up and pushes the button on the camera to stop it from recording as he lets out the rest of his sobs and wipes off his eyes with the backs of his hands. This was a stupid, stupid idea. But yet, he still found himself opening up his camera\u2019s base and pulling out the SD card and bringing it to his laptop.\u00a0</p><p>He exports the video onto his laptop and he doesn\u2019t even edit it. He doesn\u2019t do anything with. He goes right to YouTube and he uploads it and titles to \u201cThe Truth\u201d. It\u2019s 35 minutes long with everything form his crying to his raw emotions and he doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>He presses public on the video and then takes a deep breath and shuts his laptop and picks up his phone. He calls PJ.\u00a0</p><p>****\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas everything you said in the video the truth?\u201d PJ asks Phil as they sit on his couch and each have a glass of some strong liquor that PJ had brought. Phil thinks it\u2019s whiskey which he doesn\u2019t like but it does numb his mind a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you and Dan are broken up?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d Phil says. \u201cWhen Dan Skyped me the other night, he told me it wasn\u2019t a break up and we were on a break but then he told me not to contact him and he wasn\u2019t gong to contact me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why you haven\u2019t been to work?\u201d PJ asks and Phil nods. \u201cLouise told us you went on a personal leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t go to work.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even get up the energy to shower or go and get food.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLouise was saying that she knew it was about what happened with Dan but she isn\u2019t happy with having you miss work over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m quitting anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ\u2019s eyes widen and he looks at Phil with a confused look. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quitting the BBC.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Phil begins, resting back onto the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to quit for a while and honestly, I kind of want to just like\u2026stop working there and focus on something new. I could use something new in my life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to focus more on my YouTube channel and if life goes that way, I\u2019ll be traveling with Dan and supporting him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t talk to him since you uploaded the video right?\u201d PJ asks. \u201cHow do you think he\u2019s going to react to it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil shrugs and takes a sip of his drink. It burns a bit when it goes down and he winces. But within a few minutes, his mind will feel clouded again and he\u2019ll be able to feel something more than just hollow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should probably try and speak to him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can yet.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can face him yet after I just aired all of our dirty laundry into the open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2018dirty laundry\u2019. It\u2019s your real life that the tabloids were exploiting. The paparazzi deserved to be called out like you did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make what I do as right.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They sit in silence for a few moments, nothing more than just the sound of them breathing in the room and the sound of Spike gnawing on a bone in the corner of the flat.\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly, Phil\u2019s phone vibrates loudly on the couch and he jumps, reaching for it and picking it up. On the screen, it\u2019s a picture of Dan saying \u2018Dan would like to Facetime\u2019. Phil swallows and puts his finger up to PJ to keep him quiet and he nods in acknowledgement.\u00a0</p><p>He swipes the screen and answers and Dan is laying in his bed on the other side, his face red and puffy and his eyes very badly bloodshot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you make that video?\u201d Dan asks, his voice really hoarse and his words hanging between them like a tight string.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\u2019s heart began to beat faster as he begin to think of every possible reasoning he could tell Dan but frankly, none of them would be true. They would all be fibs. So he lets out a breath and then answers. \u201cI wanted people to know our story.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s voice sounds young and childlike, almost as if he\u2019s asking a parent why he couldn\u2019t have a sweet before his dinner. Phil swallows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wanted people to know what they did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan breaks eye contact with the screen and looks down at his bedsheets, his fingers appear to be picking at a piece of thread.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can delete the video if you want me to.\u201d Phil says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for posting the video.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The words catch Phil off guard. He was expecting Dan to yell at him, maybe even threaten legal action for speaking out about their relationship. But those words\u2026they were like a punch in Phil\u2019s gut in the best way possible.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen Marianne told me that you had posted that video, I initially was really upset because I thought you were doing it to maybe spite what I had asked of us on our Skype call or to even, I don\u2019t know, exploit our own relationship.\u201d Dan sniffled. \u201cMarianne barred me from watching the video but I just caved and watched it and Phil, what you said at the end, I want all of that too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil feels his eyes prick a bit with happy tears and he looks up to see PJ\u2019s own eyes have gone a bit glassy as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to wake up next to you each morning and I want to kiss you whenever I want, where I want to.\u201d Dan let out a laugh. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be real, definitely more sex because that has been incredible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ snickers in the background and Phil shushes him with a wave out of view.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut more than anything, I just want to be with you.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI want to be able to go in public with you and post photos with you and not feel like I had to hide. I\u2019ve been hiding for so long and I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d He lets out a breath. \u201cI just want to be with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dan.\u201d It\u2019s the first time Phil has said it to Dan directly and it feels a bit overwhelming but it also feels right at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI love you more than I\u2019ve ever loved anyone else before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil lets a few tears fall and Dan smiles and laughs a bit as he wipes his own tears on the other side of the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re such saps.\u201d Dan laughs and Phil laughs with him because they are. They really are but Phil doesn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a post on Instagram and Twitter confirming what you said in the video and I\u2019m going to ask for our privacy. Is that okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil nods and smiles. \u201cThat is more than okay. I think I\u2019m going to do that same.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI have to get going now because I have to get ready for Jimmy Fallon tonight, perfect timing right? But anyway, I have to start preparing but I\u2019ll make the post and everything. I\u2019m sure this will be a talking point on Jimmy Fallon if you want to tune in later?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil nods. It\u2019ll be really really late for him but he needs to watch Dan on Jimmy Fallon. He has to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later?\u201d Dan asks, breaking Phil\u2019s thoughts and Phil nods quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMmm. Love you.\u201d Dan says, a smile playing on his lips again. \u201cI like being able to say that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Phil says. \u201cLove you too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan ends the video call and Phil is left staring at his own reflection in the black screen. He immediately turns to PJ who is half pouring a new glass of whiskey and half wiping a few tears from his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you please stay with me to watch Jimmy Fallon tonight?\u201d Phil pleads.\u00a0</p><p>PJ looks at Phil and nods quickly. \u201cOf course but I have work in the morning and you do too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil shakes his head and lets out a sigh. \u201cForget work tomorrow. Just\u2026please be with me to watch Dan on there. Please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ nods and lets out a soft smile. \u201cI\u2019ll call Soph and have her bring us some snacks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should probably call my brother and my mum.\u201d Phil says, speaking out loud.\u00a0</p><p>PJ nods and Phil let\u2019s out a long sigh and picks up his phone again. He remembers how he told Dan that he\u2019ll write a note on Instagram and Twitter so he opens his notes app and just types.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAs you all know I posted the video today about Dan and I\u2019s relationship. Although that was all private information, Dan and I have since spoken and neither one of us believe the video did any harm. We\u2019re asking for everyone to respect our privacy during this time as we rebuild our relationship. Thank you all, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Just as Phil posts his note, Dan\u2019s note comes onto his timeline and he reads it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEarlier today, Phil posted a video regarding mine and his relationship these last few months. Although all of what he said is 100% accurate, we\u2019re asking you all to respect us during this time and keep our privacy as just that. I will still be on Jimmy Fallon tonight but I would like to remind everyone to keep us in your thoughts and to please leave us to settle what we need to in private. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil smiles at bit at the note and then goes to the contacts in his phone and presses his mum\u2019s name for the first time in over a week.\u00a0</p>",

Martyn tries to come and visit him but when Martyn rings his doorbell, Phil pretends he isn\u2019t home and just lays on the couch. Spike whimpers a bit and tries to scratch at the door but because Martyn doesn\u2019t have his key anymore to the flat, he can\u2019t come in.\u00a0</p><p>Martyn texts him later that day and asks him where he went and Phil just said he needed to go for a breather. It was all he\u2019s said to anyone since his last Skype call with Dan.\u00a0</p><p>He was hurt, deeply so. His heart felt shattered and his brain like mush. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he could move past any of this. In the four short months that he\u2019s grown to know who Dan was, nothing has felt like this.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s been through break ups. He\u2019s been through bad relationships. But no break up has hurt as bad as Dan telling him that he thinks they should take a break. What happened to Dan promising him that they wouldn\u2019t give up on each other and he made the promise back? Did the promise fall on deaf ears? Did Dan not really mean anything that he said?\u00a0</p><p>Phil doesn\u2019t want to believe that\u2019s the case.\u00a0</p><p>Per Dan\u2019s request, he hasn\u2019t tried to get ahold of him. He also took the initiative to delete his social media apps off from his phone so that why he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to check Dan\u2019s Twitter or Instagram and see how he\u2019s doing. The news has been quiet lately, not mentioning Dan\u2019s name. And Phil guesses that he\u2019s grateful for that. But in a selfish way, he wishes that some entertainment news site would talk about Dan so he could know what Dan was doing.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s four days later when Phil decides that he needs to actually do something. He needs to get off his arse and actually start living again. He\u2019s sat in his flat, wallowing in his own misery and barely showering. Even Spike has begun to find it a bit weird that Phil hasn\u2019t taken him for a proper walk to the park. He can tell by Spike\u2019s anxious prancing around the flat.\u00a0</p><p>He showers That\u2019s morning, dresses in a pair of his black jeans and his black shirt with the word vibes on it to add a bit of color to his dark mind. He puts in contacts instead of wearing his glasses and he styles his hair. Already, just by doing that, he feels a bit better.\u00a0</p><p>But instead of going out, he sets up behind a camera and puts some lights on him and he just sits down and takes a breath. He needs to do this. Even if he never posts the video, he needs to just let everything go.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019s going to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey everyone.\u201d He begins, voice wavering a bit. \u201cToday, I\u2019m making a video not as amazingphil but as Phil Lester. There is a lot I need to get off from my chest because of recent events and this is me doing so. In January of this year, I met Daniel Howell on the set of the new film he was working on. As some of you know, I work for the BBC as a graphic designer and I often am working in the offices doing advertising and posters and websites. But enough of that. I met Dan when I was told I was going to be an extra on the set of the film. I thought it was stupid. I was and at the BBC for bringing me in on what would be my day off to film as some extra in some big pretentious movie stars film. But that actually wasn\u2019t it at all. I met Dan on the set and my life completely changed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil took a breath and then let it out slowly as he tried to find his composure again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I exchanged numbers and he asked me to do a favor for him by showing him around London. I thought really nothing of it. He was asking as if he was a friend and I\u2019m not someone to turn down a friends request. So I went around with him in London then the paparazzi flooded us at the eye and that was when everyone saw us for the first time. At that time in our lives, we were just budding friends. We were nothing more.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil looked up his ceiling in an attempt to ground himself. He couldn\u2019t believe he was telling all of this right now to a camera but it also felt so good to just spew all of this out when he\u2019s had to hide it for so long.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I kept in contact and when he came to London a short time later, he stayed at my flat with me and I think that was when I realized he was someone I wanted to spend more time with and get to know better. So we agreed for me to come to Los Angeles to spend a week with him and I did. And it was then during that time that we solidified our relationship.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil felt his eyes prick a bit with tears as he took in a deep shuddering breath, promising to edit it out later if he ever does actually edit this video to be posted later. All he can think of is him in Dan in LA, kissing in Dan\u2019s bed and then fucking just a short time later. Phil\u2019s spins tingles as he thinks about what it was like to have sex with Dan for the first time and how amazing it had felt for him. How much love he had felt being poured from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe told each other that we were together and we wanted to be together but then the paparazzi got in our way and we couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Our relationship was going so well but then the fucking paparazzi came out and they followed us. They followed me around London where I once lived without worry. They followed Dan around Los Angeles when he isn\u2019t comfortable with it. And they ruined us. The ruined us because they caught an intimate moment between us at my flat and completely breached our privacy. And I know people are probably going to be like \u201cbut Phil, you\u2019re airing everything out into the open now\u201d and my answer to that is that I\u2019m doing it on my own terms. Dan and I wanted to come out on our own terms and it got ripped away from us by some selfish pricks we wanted it make quick money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tears are rolling freely down Phil\u2019s cheeks now. He reaches up and wipes them away as best he can but it looks like he just smeared them over his cheeks and not really wiped them away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I are taking a break now because of what the paparazzi did. Because we need to figure out how to move on with our relationship aired out because we were ready. And no one will understand the pain that I\u2019m feeling right now to love someone so damn much and have him be ripped away from me because of people who have no care for other people\u2019s privacy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A sob rips from his throat and he lurches forward as he buries his head into his hands and lets out all of the emotions that he has been feeling and bottling up these last few days. He\u2019s angry. And he\u2019s sad. And frankly, he kind of wants to be out for blood right now, yelling at people. But he\u2019s trying to keep composure and it\u2019s getting more and more difficult.\u00a0</p><p>When his tears dry up a bit and he lets himself settle, he takes a few deep breaths and then speaks again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Dan will ever see this video. For all I know, this video could separate us further than we already are. But if he is, I wanted to speak to him directly and just say some things. Dan, I love you. I know I didn\u2019t say it to you when you told me you loved me in Los Angels but I\u2019m saying it now. I love you so much and I don\u2019t want to lose you. I know you probably didn\u2019t want a video like this just airing everything out but please, please understand me. I want to be able to be with you, completely and unabashedly. I want to wake up next to you again and kiss you and, sorry for being vulgar, but I want to keep making love with you. I want to be with you\u2026.I love you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil stands up and pushes the button on the camera to stop it from recording as he lets out the rest of his sobs and wipes off his eyes with the backs of his hands. This was a stupid, stupid idea. But yet, he still found himself opening up his camera\u2019s base and pulling out the SD card and bringing it to his laptop.\u00a0</p><p>He exports the video onto his laptop and he doesn\u2019t even edit it. He doesn\u2019t do anything with. He goes right to YouTube and he uploads it and titles to \u201cThe Truth\u201d. It\u2019s 35 minutes long with everything form his crying to his raw emotions and he doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>He presses public on the video and then takes a deep breath and shuts his laptop and picks up his phone. He calls PJ.\u00a0</p><p>****\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas everything you said in the video the truth?\u201d PJ asks Phil as they sit on his couch and each have a glass of some strong liquor that PJ had brought. Phil thinks it\u2019s whiskey which he doesn\u2019t like but it does numb his mind a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you and Dan are broken up?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d Phil says. \u201cWhen Dan Skyped me the other night, he told me it wasn\u2019t a break up and we were on a break but then he told me not to contact him and he wasn\u2019t gong to contact me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why you haven\u2019t been to work?\u201d PJ asks and Phil nods. \u201cLouise told us you went on a personal leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t go to work.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even get up the energy to shower or go and get food.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLouise was saying that she knew it was about what happened with Dan but she isn\u2019t happy with having you miss work over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m quitting anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ\u2019s eyes widen and he looks at Phil with a confused look. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quitting the BBC.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Phil begins, resting back onto the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to quit for a while and honestly, I kind of want to just like\u2026stop working there and focus on something new. I could use something new in my life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to focus more on my YouTube channel and if life goes that way, I\u2019ll be traveling with Dan and supporting him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t talk to him since you uploaded the video right?\u201d PJ asks. \u201cHow do you think he\u2019s going to react to it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil shrugs and takes a sip of his drink. It burns a bit when it goes down and he winces. But within a few minutes, his mind will feel clouded again and he\u2019ll be able to feel something more than just hollow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should probably try and speak to him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can yet.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can face him yet after I just aired all of our dirty laundry into the open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2018dirty laundry\u2019. It\u2019s your real life that the tabloids were exploiting. The paparazzi deserved to be called out like you did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make what I do as right.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They sit in silence for a few moments, nothing more than just the sound of them breathing in the room and the sound of Spike gnawing on a bone in the corner of the flat.\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly, Phil\u2019s phone vibrates loudly on the couch and he jumps, reaching for it and picking it up. On the screen, it\u2019s a picture of Dan saying \u2018Dan would like to Facetime\u2019. Phil swallows and puts his finger up to PJ to keep him quiet and he nods in acknowledgement.\u00a0</p><p>He swipes the screen and answers and Dan is laying in his bed on the other side, his face red and puffy and his eyes very badly bloodshot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you make that video?\u201d Dan asks, his voice really hoarse and his words hanging between them like a tight string.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\u2019s heart began to beat faster as he begin to think of every possible reasoning he could tell Dan but frankly, none of them would be true. They would all be fibs. So he lets out a breath and then answers. \u201cI wanted people to know our story.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s voice sounds young and childlike, almost as if he\u2019s asking a parent why he couldn\u2019t have a sweet before his dinner. Phil swallows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wanted people to know what they did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan breaks eye contact with the screen and looks down at his bedsheets, his fingers appear to be picking at a piece of thread.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can delete the video if you want me to.\u201d Phil says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for posting the video.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The words catch Phil off guard. He was expecting Dan to yell at him, maybe even threaten legal action for speaking out about their relationship. But those words\u2026they were like a punch in Phil\u2019s gut in the best way possible.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen Marianne told me that you had posted that video, I initially was really upset because I thought you were doing it to maybe spite what I had asked of us on our Skype call or to even, I don\u2019t know, exploit our own relationship.\u201d Dan sniffled. \u201cMarianne barred me from watching the video but I just caved and watched it and Phil, what you said at the end, I want all of that too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil feels his eyes prick a bit with happy tears and he looks up to see PJ\u2019s own eyes have gone a bit glassy as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to wake up next to you each morning and I want to kiss you whenever I want, where I want to.\u201d Dan let out a laugh. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be real, definitely more sex because that has been incredible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ snickers in the background and Phil shushes him with a wave out of view.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut more than anything, I just want to be with you.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI want to be able to go in public with you and post photos with you and not feel like I had to hide. I\u2019ve been hiding for so long and I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d He lets out a breath. \u201cI just want to be with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dan.\u201d It\u2019s the first time Phil has said it to Dan directly and it feels a bit overwhelming but it also feels right at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI love you more than I\u2019ve ever loved anyone else before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil lets a few tears fall and Dan smiles and laughs a bit as he wipes his own tears on the other side of the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re such saps.\u201d Dan laughs and Phil laughs with him because they are. They really are but Phil doesn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a post on Instagram and Twitter confirming what you said in the video and I\u2019m going to ask for our privacy. Is that okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil nods and smiles. \u201cThat is more than okay. I think I\u2019m going to do that same.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI have to get going now because I have to get ready for Jimmy Fallon tonight, perfect timing right? But anyway, I have to start preparing but I\u2019ll make the post and everything. I\u2019m sure this will be a talking point on Jimmy Fallon if you want to tune in later?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil nods. It\u2019ll be really really late for him but he needs to watch Dan on Jimmy Fallon. He has to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later?\u201d Dan asks, breaking Phil\u2019s thoughts and Phil nods quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMmm. Love you.\u201d Dan says, a smile playing on his lips again. \u201cI like being able to say that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Phil says. \u201cLove you too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan ends the video call and Phil is left staring at his own reflection in the black screen. He immediately turns to PJ who is half pouring a new glass of whiskey and half wiping a few tears from his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you please stay with me to watch Jimmy Fallon tonight?\u201d Phil pleads.\u00a0</p><p>PJ looks at Phil and nods quickly. \u201cOf course but I have work in the morning and you do too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil shakes his head and lets out a sigh. \u201cForget work tomorrow. Just\u2026please be with me to watch Dan on there. Please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ nods and lets out a soft smile. \u201cI\u2019ll call Soph and have her bring us some snacks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should probably call my brother and my mum.\u201d Phil says, speaking out loud.\u00a0</p><p>PJ nods and Phil let\u2019s out a long sigh and picks up his phone again. He remembers how he told Dan that he\u2019ll write a note on Instagram and Twitter so he opens his notes app and just types.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAs you all know I posted the video today about Dan and I\u2019s relationship. Although that was all private information, Dan and I have since spoken and neither one of us believe the video did any harm. We\u2019re asking for everyone to respect our privacy during this time as we rebuild our relationship. Thank you all, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Just as Phil posts his note, Dan\u2019s note comes onto his timeline and he reads it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEarlier today, Phil posted a video regarding mine and his relationship these last few months. Although all of what he said is 100% accurate, we\u2019re asking you all to respect us during this time and keep our privacy as just that. I will still be on Jimmy Fallon tonight but I would like to remind everyone to keep us in your thoughts and to please leave us to settle what we need to in private. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil smiles at bit at the note and then goes to the contacts in his phone and presses his mum\u2019s name for the first time in over a week.\u00a0</p>",

Martyn tries to come and visit him but when Martyn rings his doorbell, Phil pretends he isn\u2019t home and just lays on the couch. Spike whimpers a bit and tries to scratch at the door but because Martyn doesn\u2019t have his key anymore to the flat, he can\u2019t come in.\u00a0</p><p>Martyn texts him later that day and asks him where he went and Phil just said he needed to go for a breather. It was all he\u2019s said to anyone since his last Skype call with Dan.\u00a0</p><p>He was hurt, deeply so. His heart felt shattered and his brain like mush. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he could move past any of this. In the four short months that he\u2019s grown to know who Dan was, nothing has felt like this.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s been through break ups. He\u2019s been through bad relationships. But no break up has hurt as bad as Dan telling him that he thinks they should take a break. What happened to Dan promising him that they wouldn\u2019t give up on each other and he made the promise back? Did the promise fall on deaf ears? Did Dan not really mean anything that he said?\u00a0</p><p>Phil doesn\u2019t want to believe that\u2019s the case.\u00a0</p><p>Per Dan\u2019s request, he hasn\u2019t tried to get ahold of him. He also took the initiative to delete his social media apps off from his phone so that why he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to check Dan\u2019s Twitter or Instagram and see how he\u2019s doing. The news has been quiet lately, not mentioning Dan\u2019s name. And Phil guesses that he\u2019s grateful for that. But in a selfish way, he wishes that some entertainment news site would talk about Dan so he could know what Dan was doing.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s four days later when Phil decides that he needs to actually do something. He needs to get off his arse and actually start living again. He\u2019s sat in his flat, wallowing in his own misery and barely showering. Even Spike has begun to find it a bit weird that Phil hasn\u2019t taken him for a proper walk to the park. He can tell by Spike\u2019s anxious prancing around the flat.\u00a0</p><p>He showers That\u2019s morning, dresses in a pair of his black jeans and his black shirt with the word vibes on it to add a bit of color to his dark mind. He puts in contacts instead of wearing his glasses and he styles his hair. Already, just by doing that, he feels a bit better.\u00a0</p><p>But instead of going out, he sets up behind a camera and puts some lights on him and he just sits down and takes a breath. He needs to do this. Even if he never posts the video, he needs to just let everything go.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019s going to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey everyone.\u201d He begins, voice wavering a bit. \u201cToday, I\u2019m making a video not as amazingphil but as Phil Lester. There is a lot I need to get off from my chest because of recent events and this is me doing so. In January of this year, I met Daniel Howell on the set of the new film he was working on. As some of you know, I work for the BBC as a graphic designer and I often am working in the offices doing advertising and posters and websites. But enough of that. I met Dan when I was told I was going to be an extra on the set of the film. I thought it was stupid. I was and at the BBC for bringing me in on what would be my day off to film as some extra in some big pretentious movie stars film. But that actually wasn\u2019t it at all. I met Dan on the set and my life completely changed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil took a breath and then let it out slowly as he tried to find his composure again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I exchanged numbers and he asked me to do a favor for him by showing him around London. I thought really nothing of it. He was asking as if he was a friend and I\u2019m not someone to turn down a friends request. So I went around with him in London then the paparazzi flooded us at the eye and that was when everyone saw us for the first time. At that time in our lives, we were just budding friends. We were nothing more.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil looked up his ceiling in an attempt to ground himself. He couldn\u2019t believe he was telling all of this right now to a camera but it also felt so good to just spew all of this out when he\u2019s had to hide it for so long.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I kept in contact and when he came to London a short time later, he stayed at my flat with me and I think that was when I realized he was someone I wanted to spend more time with and get to know better. So we agreed for me to come to Los Angeles to spend a week with him and I did. And it was then during that time that we solidified our relationship.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil felt his eyes prick a bit with tears as he took in a deep shuddering breath, promising to edit it out later if he ever does actually edit this video to be posted later. All he can think of is him in Dan in LA, kissing in Dan\u2019s bed and then fucking just a short time later. Phil\u2019s spins tingles as he thinks about what it was like to have sex with Dan for the first time and how amazing it had felt for him. How much love he had felt being poured from Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe told each other that we were together and we wanted to be together but then the paparazzi got in our way and we couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Our relationship was going so well but then the fucking paparazzi came out and they followed us. They followed me around London where I once lived without worry. They followed Dan around Los Angeles when he isn\u2019t comfortable with it. And they ruined us. The ruined us because they caught an intimate moment between us at my flat and completely breached our privacy. And I know people are probably going to be like \u201cbut Phil, you\u2019re airing everything out into the open now\u201d and my answer to that is that I\u2019m doing it on my own terms. Dan and I wanted to come out on our own terms and it got ripped away from us by some selfish pricks we wanted it make quick money.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tears are rolling freely down Phil\u2019s cheeks now. He reaches up and wipes them away as best he can but it looks like he just smeared them over his cheeks and not really wiped them away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDan and I are taking a break now because of what the paparazzi did. Because we need to figure out how to move on with our relationship aired out because we were ready. And no one will understand the pain that I\u2019m feeling right now to love someone so damn much and have him be ripped away from me because of people who have no care for other people\u2019s privacy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A sob rips from his throat and he lurches forward as he buries his head into his hands and lets out all of the emotions that he has been feeling and bottling up these last few days. He\u2019s angry. And he\u2019s sad. And frankly, he kind of wants to be out for blood right now, yelling at people. But he\u2019s trying to keep composure and it\u2019s getting more and more difficult.\u00a0</p><p>When his tears dry up a bit and he lets himself settle, he takes a few deep breaths and then speaks again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Dan will ever see this video. For all I know, this video could separate us further than we already are. But if he is, I wanted to speak to him directly and just say some things. Dan, I love you. I know I didn\u2019t say it to you when you told me you loved me in Los Angels but I\u2019m saying it now. I love you so much and I don\u2019t want to lose you. I know you probably didn\u2019t want a video like this just airing everything out but please, please understand me. I want to be able to be with you, completely and unabashedly. I want to wake up next to you again and kiss you and, sorry for being vulgar, but I want to keep making love with you. I want to be with you\u2026.I love you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil stands up and pushes the button on the camera to stop it from recording as he lets out the rest of his sobs and wipes off his eyes with the backs of his hands. This was a stupid, stupid idea. But yet, he still found himself opening up his camera\u2019s base and pulling out the SD card and bringing it to his laptop.\u00a0</p><p>He exports the video onto his laptop and he doesn\u2019t even edit it. He doesn\u2019t do anything with. He goes right to YouTube and he uploads it and titles to \u201cThe Truth\u201d. It\u2019s 35 minutes long with everything form his crying to his raw emotions and he doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>He presses public on the video and then takes a deep breath and shuts his laptop and picks up his phone. He calls PJ.\u00a0</p><p>****\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas everything you said in the video the truth?\u201d PJ asks Phil as they sit on his couch and each have a glass of some strong liquor that PJ had brought. Phil thinks it\u2019s whiskey which he doesn\u2019t like but it does numb his mind a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you and Dan are broken up?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d Phil says. \u201cWhen Dan Skyped me the other night, he told me it wasn\u2019t a break up and we were on a break but then he told me not to contact him and he wasn\u2019t gong to contact me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rough.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs that why you haven\u2019t been to work?\u201d PJ asks and Phil nods. \u201cLouise told us you went on a personal leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t go to work.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even get up the energy to shower or go and get food.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLouise was saying that she knew it was about what happened with Dan but she isn\u2019t happy with having you miss work over it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m quitting anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ\u2019s eyes widen and he looks at Phil with a confused look. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quitting the BBC.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Phil begins, resting back onto the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to quit for a while and honestly, I kind of want to just like\u2026stop working there and focus on something new. I could use something new in my life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to focus more on my YouTube channel and if life goes that way, I\u2019ll be traveling with Dan and supporting him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t talk to him since you uploaded the video right?\u201d PJ asks. \u201cHow do you think he\u2019s going to react to it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil shrugs and takes a sip of his drink. It burns a bit when it goes down and he winces. But within a few minutes, his mind will feel clouded again and he\u2019ll be able to feel something more than just hollow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should probably try and speak to him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can yet.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can face him yet after I just aired all of our dirty laundry into the open.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2018dirty laundry\u2019. It\u2019s your real life that the tabloids were exploiting. The paparazzi deserved to be called out like you did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make what I do as right.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They sit in silence for a few moments, nothing more than just the sound of them breathing in the room and the sound of Spike gnawing on a bone in the corner of the flat.\u00a0</p><p>Suddenly, Phil\u2019s phone vibrates loudly on the couch and he jumps, reaching for it and picking it up. On the screen, it\u2019s a picture of Dan saying \u2018Dan would like to Facetime\u2019. Phil swallows and puts his finger up to PJ to keep him quiet and he nods in acknowledgement.\u00a0</p><p>He swipes the screen and answers and Dan is laying in his bed on the other side, his face red and puffy and his eyes very badly bloodshot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy did you make that video?\u201d Dan asks, his voice really hoarse and his words hanging between them like a tight string.\u00a0</p><p>Phil\u2019s heart began to beat faster as he begin to think of every possible reasoning he could tell Dan but frankly, none of them would be true. They would all be fibs. So he lets out a breath and then answers. \u201cI wanted people to know our story.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s voice sounds young and childlike, almost as if he\u2019s asking a parent why he couldn\u2019t have a sweet before his dinner. Phil swallows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wanted people to know what they did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan breaks eye contact with the screen and looks down at his bedsheets, his fingers appear to be picking at a piece of thread.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can delete the video if you want me to.\u201d Phil says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for posting the video.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The words catch Phil off guard. He was expecting Dan to yell at him, maybe even threaten legal action for speaking out about their relationship. But those words\u2026they were like a punch in Phil\u2019s gut in the best way possible.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen Marianne told me that you had posted that video, I initially was really upset because I thought you were doing it to maybe spite what I had asked of us on our Skype call or to even, I don\u2019t know, exploit our own relationship.\u201d Dan sniffled. \u201cMarianne barred me from watching the video but I just caved and watched it and Phil, what you said at the end, I want all of that too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil feels his eyes prick a bit with happy tears and he looks up to see PJ\u2019s own eyes have gone a bit glassy as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to wake up next to you each morning and I want to kiss you whenever I want, where I want to.\u201d Dan let out a laugh. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be real, definitely more sex because that has been incredible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ snickers in the background and Phil shushes him with a wave out of view.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut more than anything, I just want to be with you.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI want to be able to go in public with you and post photos with you and not feel like I had to hide. I\u2019ve been hiding for so long and I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d He lets out a breath. \u201cI just want to be with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dan.\u201d It\u2019s the first time Phil has said it to Dan directly and it feels a bit overwhelming but it also feels right at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI love you more than I\u2019ve ever loved anyone else before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil lets a few tears fall and Dan smiles and laughs a bit as he wipes his own tears on the other side of the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re such saps.\u201d Dan laughs and Phil laughs with him because they are. They really are but Phil doesn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a post on Instagram and Twitter confirming what you said in the video and I\u2019m going to ask for our privacy. Is that okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil nods and smiles. \u201cThat is more than okay. I think I\u2019m going to do that same.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI have to get going now because I have to get ready for Jimmy Fallon tonight, perfect timing right? But anyway, I have to start preparing but I\u2019ll make the post and everything. I\u2019m sure this will be a talking point on Jimmy Fallon if you want to tune in later?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil nods. It\u2019ll be really really late for him but he needs to watch Dan on Jimmy Fallon. He has to.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later?\u201d Dan asks, breaking Phil\u2019s thoughts and Phil nods quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMmm. Love you.\u201d Dan says, a smile playing on his lips again. \u201cI like being able to say that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Phil says. \u201cLove you too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan ends the video call and Phil is left staring at his own reflection in the black screen. He immediately turns to PJ who is half pouring a new glass of whiskey and half wiping a few tears from his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you please stay with me to watch Jimmy Fallon tonight?\u201d Phil pleads.\u00a0</p><p>PJ looks at Phil and nods quickly. \u201cOf course but I have work in the morning and you do too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil shakes his head and lets out a sigh. \u201cForget work tomorrow. Just\u2026please be with me to watch Dan on there. Please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>PJ nods and lets out a soft smile. \u201cI\u2019ll call Soph and have her bring us some snacks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should probably call my brother and my mum.\u201d Phil says, speaking out loud.\u00a0</p><p>PJ nods and Phil let\u2019s out a long sigh and picks up his phone again. He remembers how he told Dan that he\u2019ll write a note on Instagram and Twitter so he opens his notes app and just types.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAs you all know I posted the video today about Dan and I\u2019s relationship. Although that was all private information, Dan and I have since spoken and neither one of us believe the video did any harm. We\u2019re asking for everyone to respect our privacy during this time as we rebuild our relationship. Thank you all, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Just as Phil posts his note, Dan\u2019s note comes onto his timeline and he reads it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEarlier today, Phil posted a video regarding mine and his relationship these last few months. Although all of what he said is 100% accurate, we\u2019re asking you all to respect us during this time and keep our privacy as just that. I will still be on Jimmy Fallon tonight but I would like to remind everyone to keep us in your thoughts and to please leave us to settle what we need to in private. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phil smiles at bit at the note and then goes to the contacts in his phone and presses his mum\u2019s name for the first time in over a week.\u00a0</p>",

I thought really nothing of it. He was asking as if he was a friend and I&rsquo;m not someone to turn down a friends request. So I went around with him in London then the paparazzi flooded us at the eye and that was when everyone saw us for the first time. At that time in our lives, we were just budding friends. We were nothing more.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil looked up his ceiling in an attempt to ground himself. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he was telling all of this right now to a camera but it also felt so good to just spew all of this out when he&rsquo;s had to hide it for so long.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan and I kept in contact and when he came to London a short time later, he stayed at my flat with me and I think that was when I realized he was someone I wanted to spend more time with and get to know better. So we agreed for me to come to Los Angeles to spend a week with him and I did. And it was then during that time that we solidified our relationship.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil felt his eyes prick a bit with tears as he took in a deep shuddering breath, promising to edit it out later if he ever does actually edit this video to be posted later. All he can think of is him in Dan in LA, kissing in Dan&rsquo;s bed and then fucking just a short time later. Phil&rsquo;s spins tingles as he thinks about what it was like to have sex with Dan for the first time and how amazing it had felt for him. How much love he had felt being poured from Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We told each other that we were together and we wanted to be together but then the paparazzi got in our way and we couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore. Our relationship was going so well but then the fucking paparazzi came out and they followed us. They followed me around London where I once lived without worry. They followed Dan around Los Angeles when he isn&rsquo;t comfortable with it. And they ruined us. The ruined us because they caught an intimate moment between us at my flat and completely breached our privacy. And I know people are probably going to be like &ldquo;but Phil, you&rsquo;re airing everything out into the open now&rdquo; and my answer to that is that I&rsquo;m doing it on my own terms. Dan and I wanted to come out on our own terms and it got ripped away from us by some selfish pricks we wanted it make quick money.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tears are rolling freely down Phil&rsquo;s cheeks now. He reaches up and wipes them away as best he can but it looks like he just smeared them over his cheeks and not really wiped them away.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan and I are taking a break now because of what the paparazzi did. Because we need to figure out how to move on with our relationship aired out because we were ready. And no one will understand the pain that I&rsquo;m feeling right now to love someone so damn much and have him be ripped away from me because of people who have no care for other people&rsquo;s privacy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>A sob rips from his throat and he lurches forward as he buries his head into his hands and lets out all of the emotions that he has been feeling and bottling up these last few days. He&rsquo;s angry. And he&rsquo;s sad. And frankly, he kind of wants to be out for blood right now, yelling at people. But he&rsquo;s trying to keep composure and it&rsquo;s getting more and more difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>When his tears dry up a bit and he lets himself settle, he takes a few deep breaths and then speaks again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if Dan will ever see this video. For all I know, this video could separate us further than we already are. But if he is, I wanted to speak to him directly and just say some things. Dan, I love you. I know I didn&rsquo;t say it to you when you told me you loved me in Los Angels but I&rsquo;m saying it now. I love you so much and I don&rsquo;t want to lose you. I know you probably didn&rsquo;t want a video like this just airing everything out but please, please understand me. I want to be able to be with you, completely and unabashedly. I want to wake up next to you again and kiss you and, sorry for being vulgar, but I want to keep making love with you. I want to be with you&hellip;.I love you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil stands up and pushes the button on the camera to stop it from recording as he lets out the rest of his sobs and wipes off his eyes with the backs of his hands. This was a stupid, stupid idea. But yet, he still found himself opening up his camera&rsquo;s base and pulling out the SD card and bringing it to his laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>He exports the video onto his laptop and he doesn&rsquo;t even edit it. He doesn&rsquo;t do anything with. He goes right to YouTube and he uploads it and titles to &ldquo;The Truth&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s 35 minutes long with everything form his crying to his raw emotions and he doesn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp;</p><p>He presses public on the video and then takes a deep breath and shuts his laptop and picks up his phone. He calls PJ.&nbsp;</p><p>****&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Was everything you said in the video the truth?&rdquo; PJ asks Phil as they sit on his couch and each have a glass of some strong liquor that PJ had brought. Phil thinks it&rsquo;s whiskey which he doesn&rsquo;t like but it does numb his mind a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So you and Dan are broken up?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and no.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;When Dan Skyped me the other night, he told me it wasn&rsquo;t a break up and we were on a break but then he told me not to contact him and he wasn&rsquo;t gong to contact me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rough.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that why you haven&rsquo;t been to work?&rdquo; PJ asks and Phil nods. &ldquo;Louise told us you went on a personal leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go to work.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even get up the energy to shower or go and get food.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Louise was saying that she knew it was about what happened with Dan but she isn&rsquo;t happy with having you miss work over it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quitting anyway.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>PJ&rsquo;s eyes widen and he looks at Phil with a confused look. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quitting the BBC.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Phil begins, resting back onto the couch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to quit for a while and honestly, I kind of want to just like&hellip;stop working there and focus on something new. I could use something new in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to focus more on my YouTube channel and if life goes that way, I&rsquo;ll be traveling with Dan and supporting him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t talk to him since you uploaded the video right?&rdquo; PJ asks. &ldquo;How do you think he&rsquo;s going to react to it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil shrugs and takes a sip of his drink. It burns a bit when it goes down and he winces. But within a few minutes, his mind will feel clouded again and he&rsquo;ll be able to feel something more than just hollow.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You should probably try and speak to him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can yet.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can face him yet after I just aired all of our dirty laundry into the open.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;dirty laundry&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s your real life that the tabloids were exploiting. The paparazzi deserved to be called out like you did.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make what I do as right.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>They sit in silence for a few moments, nothing more than just the sound of them breathing in the room and the sound of Spike gnawing on a bone in the corner of the flat.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, Phil&rsquo;s phone vibrates loudly on the couch and he jumps, reaching for it and picking it up. On the screen, it&rsquo;s a picture of Dan saying &lsquo;Dan would like to Facetime&rsquo;. Phil swallows and puts his finger up to PJ to keep him quiet and he nods in acknowledgement.&nbsp;</p><p>He swipes the screen and answers and Dan is laying in his bed on the other side, his face red and puffy and his eyes very badly bloodshot.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you make that video?&rdquo; Dan asks, his voice really hoarse and his words hanging between them like a tight string.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s heart began to beat faster as he begin to think of every possible reasoning he could tell Dan but frankly, none of them would be true. They would all be fibs. So he lets out a breath and then answers. &ldquo;I wanted people to know our story.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s voice sounds young and childlike, almost as if he&rsquo;s asking a parent why he couldn&rsquo;t have a sweet before his dinner. Phil swallows.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted people to know what they did.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan breaks eye contact with the screen and looks down at his bedsheets, his fingers appear to be picking at a piece of thread.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can delete the video if you want me to.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for posting the video.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The words catch Phil off guard. He was expecting Dan to yell at him, maybe even threaten legal action for speaking out about their relationship. But those words&hellip;they were like a punch in Phil&rsquo;s gut in the best way possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When Marianne told me that you had posted that video, I initially was really upset because I thought you were doing it to maybe spite what I had asked of us on our Skype call or to even, I don&rsquo;t know, exploit our own relationship.&rdquo; Dan sniffled. &ldquo;Marianne barred me from watching the video but I just caved and watched it and Phil, what you said at the end, I want all of that too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil feels his eyes prick a bit with happy tears and he looks up to see PJ&rsquo;s own eyes have gone a bit glassy as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to wake up next to you each morning and I want to kiss you whenever I want, where I want to.&rdquo; Dan let out a laugh. &ldquo;And let&rsquo;s be real, definitely more sex because that has been incredible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>PJ snickers in the background and Phil shushes him with a wave out of view.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But more than anything, I just want to be with you.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I want to be able to go in public with you and post photos with you and not feel like I had to hide. I&rsquo;ve been hiding for so long and I&rsquo;m sick of it.&rdquo; He lets out a breath. &ldquo;I just want to be with you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Dan.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the first time Phil has said it to Dan directly and it feels a bit overwhelming but it also feels right at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I love you more than I&rsquo;ve ever loved anyone else before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil lets a few tears fall and Dan smiles and laughs a bit as he wipes his own tears on the other side of the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re such saps.&rdquo; Dan laughs and Phil laughs with him because they are. They really are but Phil doesn&rsquo;t care. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a post on Instagram and Twitter confirming what you said in the video and I&rsquo;m going to ask for our privacy. Is that okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil nods and smiles. &ldquo;That is more than okay. I think I&rsquo;m going to do that same.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I have to get going now because I have to get ready for Jimmy Fallon tonight, perfect timing right? But anyway, I have to start preparing but I&rsquo;ll make the post and everything. I&rsquo;m sure this will be a talking point on Jimmy Fallon if you want to tune in later?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil nods. It&rsquo;ll be really really late for him but he needs to watch Dan on Jimmy Fallon. He has to.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you later?&rdquo; Dan asks, breaking Phil&rsquo;s thoughts and Phil nods quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm. Love you.&rdquo; Dan says, a smile playing on his lips again. &ldquo;I like being able to say that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Love you too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan ends the video call and Phil is left staring at his own reflection in the black screen. He immediately turns to PJ who is half pouring a new glass of whiskey and half wiping a few tears from his cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you please stay with me to watch Jimmy Fallon tonight?&rdquo; Phil pleads.&nbsp;</p><p>PJ looks at Phil and nods quickly. &ldquo;Of course but I have work in the morning and you do too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil shakes his head and lets out a sigh. &ldquo;Forget work tomorrow. Just&hellip;please be with me to watch Dan on there. Please?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>PJ nods and lets out a soft smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Soph and have her bring us some snacks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I should probably call my brother and my mum.&rdquo; Phil says, speaking out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>PJ nods and Phil let&rsquo;s out a long sigh and picks up his phone again. He remembers how he told Dan that he&rsquo;ll write a note on Instagram and Twitter so he opens his notes app and just types.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;As you all know I posted the video today about Dan and I&rsquo;s relationship. Although that was all private information, Dan and I have since spoken and neither one of us believe the video did any harm. We&rsquo;re asking for everyone to respect our privacy during this time as we rebuild our relationship. Thank you all, Phil.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Phil posts his note, Dan&rsquo;s note comes onto his timeline and he reads it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Earlier today, Phil posted a video regarding mine and his relationship these last few months. Although all of what he said is 100% accurate, we&rsquo;re asking you all to respect us during this time and keep our privacy as just that. I will still be on Jimmy Fallon tonight but I would like to remind everyone to keep us in your thoughts and to please leave us to settle what we need to in private. Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Phil smiles at bit at the note and then goes to the contacts in his phone and presses his mum&rsquo;s name for the first time in over a week.&nbsp;</p>",
