He would be an awesome <i>Ravenclaw</i>, definitely&hellip; Bt he would match in <i>Slytherin</i>, there&rsquo;s no doubt of that. But now that I think about it, maybe <i>Hufflepuff</i> would be the right house for him. He looks like a kind person. I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p><p><b><i>(Y/n)</i></b> - Shut up and choose!

Probably you&rsquo;ll find some lessons difficult at first but,  if you need help, feel free to ask me. Anything you need, eh? Don&rsquo;t be  ashamed, you won&rsquo;t bother me! ANYTHING I think it&rsquo;s cool that there are  new students! Do you know the Hogwart&rsquo;s Houses work? If you don&rsquo;t, I  don&rsquo;t mind telling you.</p><p><b><i>(Y/n)</i></b> - Thank you, but it won&rsquo;t be necesary. Dumbledore  already told me. you really enjoy helping, right? In that case, I&rsquo;m  counting on you. </p><p>After saying that, (Y/n) smiled, half relieved and half happy, and Sirius blushed when he saw that unexpected beautiful smile.</p><p>~\u2664~\u2661~\u25c7~\u2667~</p><p>Once they were at <i>Gryffindor</i>&rsquo;s common room, Sirius presented (Y/n) to his best friends:</p><p><i><b>Sirius </b></i>- Guys!

Apart from his dear &nbsp; friends James, Remus and Peter, he felt like nobody truly knew him.</p><p>When &nbsp;everyone had arrived, like always, all the first year students  were &nbsp;assigned to their houses. After that, Dumbledore made an  announcement:</p><p><i><b>Dumbledore</b></i><i> - </i>I &nbsp;know this doesn&rsquo;t usually  happen, but I have something to tell you. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll have a new student. His  powers appeared for the first time this &nbsp;summer and he knows nothing  about the magic world, but due to his age &nbsp;and his academic results at  the muggle school, we&rsquo;ve decided that it &nbsp;will be better if he goes  directly to fourth year so he can get used to &nbsp;this faster.Please,  (Y/n), come here for a moment.</p><p>(Y/n), following Dumbledore&rsquo;s instructions, he put on the Sorting Hat to know which house was he in:</p><p><b><i>Sorting Hat </i></b>- Mmmm, interesting&hellip; this boy has talent. He would be an awesome <i>Ravenclaw</i>, definitely&hellip; Bt he would match in <i>Slytherin</i>, there&rsquo;s no doubt of that. But now that I think about it, maybe <i>Hufflepuff</i> would be the right house for him. He looks like a kind person. I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p><p><b><i>(Y/n)</i></b> - Shut up and choose! We don&rsquo;t have all day, god!</p><p><b><i>Sorting Hat</i></b> &nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t talk to me like that, have some  respect. Well, at least I can see you&rsquo;re brave. You&rsquo;ll have problems  here since you&rsquo;re new, that for sure, but you still decided to come  here. All right, I&rsquo;ve decided. <i>Gryffindor</i>!</p><p>(Y/n) smiled and ran to the table were all his new classmates were. He sat next to one that looked nice:</p><p><b><i>(Y/n)</i></b> - Hey!
