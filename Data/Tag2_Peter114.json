He woke up with a smile on his face though, glowing in the way that only post-heat Omega\u2019s did, eyes shining and skin flushed and it was a vast contrast to how completely fucked out Wade looked&ndash; exhausted and dehydrated and worn the hell out because <i>wow </i>did heat take a lot of energy.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cTo be fair&ndash;\u201d he groaned when Peter jumped on the bed and clambered over to sit on Wade\u2019s waist. \u201cTo be fair, Alpha\u2019s gotta do all the work with this sort of thing. You just get to lay there and take knots. No wonder you aren\u2019t exhausted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI get to lay there and take knots?!\u201d Peter\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cAre you <i>serious </i>with that!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby boy.\u201d A jaw cracking yawn, and Wade yanked the Omega down to snuggle. \u201cYou take knots like a champ. You should be real proud of that.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>WADE</i>!\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>Even with Wade\u2019s less than stellar conversation skills, it had been a good heat and Peter was a happy, satisfied Omega. </p><p>He\u2019d be happier though, if the Alpha had finished what he\u2019d started so many times, and turned the bruises at Peter\u2019s bonding spot into a full fledged bite, finishing his claim. </p><p>In fact, Peter would have been happy if Wade had told him<i> I love you</i> back just once, but every time the Alpha had just tucked him close and kissed him breathless and left it alone. </p><p>It was fine. The Alpha wanted to take things slow and that was fine. Peter was a little thrown by just how quickly he was ready and willing to bond with Wade, considering how much he\u2019d balked at anything resembling settling down with Harry, and maybe it was <i>crazy </i>but it was also easy, <i>so easy</i> to be with Wade that Peter found himself wondering why he\u2019d wasted any time with any one else. </p><p>So they hadn\u2019t bonded yet. It was fine. </p><p>Wade didn\u2019t claim Peter the second heat together either, even though by that point he had moved the Omega out of the shitty studio apartment and into his shockingly nice place downtown. </p><p>\u201cUh yes, question?\u201d Peter asked the first time Wade brought him home to the high rise complex. \u201cWhy the fuck do you hang out at Weasel\u2019s if you have a place like this to come home to?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d Wade shrugged and dropped the one measly box of Peter\u2019s things in the bedroom closet. \u201cJust didn\u2019t feel right, didn\u2019t really feel like I belonged.\u201d His eyes flickered red then back to hazel as he looked Peter over with a possessive growl. \u201cDidn\u2019t feel like home yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peter\u2019s hand went unconsciously to his neck, scratching over the disappointingly clear skin. \u201cAnd now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cApparently all it took is a hot Omega with legs that don\u2019t quit to make it feel like home.\u201d Wade held out his hand and pulled Peter close, burying his nose in the thick hair and rumbling approvingly. \u201cM\u2019glad you\u2019re here, baby boy. Glad you wanted to move in with me.\u201d </p><p>They\u2019d gone shopping after that, shopping for everything from new sheets to dishes and curtains and then spent the rest of the weekend christening every available surface in the three bedroom apartment, teasing and laughing and saying \u201cI love you\u201d in a hundred different ways, but when Peter\u2019s heat came on, Wade still didn\u2019t bite him. </p><p>Well no, he bit him several times&ndash; at the juncture of hip and thigh just sharp enough to make Peter shriek, softer nibbles along Peter\u2019s jaw, harder in the meat of Peter\u2019s ass before Wade spread him open and took Peter apart with nothing more than his tongue and fingers&ndash;</p><p>But not where Peter wanted him to, not where the Omega <i>needed </i>him to. </p><p>So before his third heat with Wade rolled around, Peter sat his Alpha down and just asked him point blank&ndash; \u201cWhy won\u2019t you bond with me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wade froze with a sandwich halfway to his mouth, right in the middle of carbo-loading to prepare for the next few days since neither of them remembered to eat anything other than granola bars during heat. \u201cWhat&ndash; what do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, this will be our third heat together.\u201d Peter pointed out. \u201cAnd before this, you helped me through three other ones, even if you weren\u2019t you know&ndash;<i>helping </i>me. And I thought you\u2019d bite me the first time when you told me it wasn\u2019t just a trauma bond between us but you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought it was too soon.\u201d Wade swallowed a big bite and cleared his throat. \u201cOur first time&ndash; I didn\u2019t want you to regret it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell what about last time?\u201d Peter countered. \u201cYou moved me in here and I know you love me and I know you imprinted <i>mate </i>on me, and obviously I&ndash;\u201d he blushed and Wade didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get used to how precious that was. \u201c&ndash;obviously I\u2019m fine with it. Omega\u2019s don\u2019t imprint like you Alpha\u2019s do, but I always knew you were good for me, knew I was safe with you, right from the start.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, sweetheart.\u201d Wade\u2019s voice was a little hoarse and he cleared his throat again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you always knew you were safe with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d The Omega bit his lip and peeked up from his lashes shyly, knowing damn well his Alpha couldn\u2019t resist it, and Wade proved his point by just chucking the sandwich and grabbing Peter up into his lap. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you want to bond with me?\u201d </p><p>Wade sighed, sifting his Omega\u2019s hair through his fingers for a long minute as he though. \u201cPete, you don\u2019t want a mate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds fake, but okay.\u201d Peter frowned. \u201cWhy would you think I don\u2019t want a mate?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou left Harry because he wanted a bond and kids and all that sort of crap.\u201d Wade shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to assume you\u2019d change your mind for me. Just because you feel safe with me doesn\u2019t mean you want to deal with the glitter covered trash party that is my general self forever. And you\u2019re so incoherent during your heat, even if you asked me to bite you I\u2019d always feel like&ndash;\u201d </p><p>He stopped, shook his head. \u201c&ndash;I\u2019d always feel like I took advantage of you. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying during heat, in fact you should hear half the shit you say. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love all of it but if someone was listening&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf someone was listening?\u201d Peter interrupted, eyes sparking with laughter. \u201cAnd who exactly would be listening to the nonsense I say during my heat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuckin no one.\u201d Wade snarled, eyes red at even the thought of anyone ever hearing the way Peter talked during heat, anyone else being privy to moments that were meant to be between him and his <i>mate</i>. \u201cNo one else listens.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSuch a big scary Alpha.\u201d Peter pushed their foreheads together and growled playfully, reveling in the freedom he had to tease and push and just be <i>real </i>with his Alpha. It was another thing he hadn\u2019t realized he didn\u2019t have with Harry and he loved that he had it with Wade. </p><p>\u201cAnd by the way?\u201d he continued. \u201c\u201cI left Harry because he refused to get me suppressants so I could continue school. He tore up internship papers because he didn\u2019t want me working outside the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you&ndash;\u201d he inched closer, purring quietly when Wade put both arms around him. \u201c&ndash;you\u2019ve gone out and got me suppressants for over six months now. Yesterday you wrote out a ridiculous sized check so I can go back to school for the spring semester. I turned down a job last month because it meant an hour subway ride each way, so you offered to buy me a car instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my mate, Pete.\u201d The Alpha\u2019s eyes shuttered a possessive shade of red again as he stroked his thumb over the bonding spot at the base of Peter\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna do whatever it takes to keep you happy, just like I did when we first met and just like I\u2019ve been trying to do the last few months. You\u2019re my mate whether there\u2019s a mark on you or not, it\u2019s enough for me Pete.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make it that easy?\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cYou\u2019d give up the security of a bond if you thought I didn\u2019t want it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make it that easy.\u201d Wade confirmed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try and tie you down like Harry did. I want you to be happy and that\u2019s my entire extensive thought process on the matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd if I wanted to be tied to you?\u201d There went Peter with that shy look again, all soft eyes and long lashes and hesitant smile. \u201cWhat about then? Would you still tell me no?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe hell I would. If I knew you wanted me as mate I\u2019d bend you over that chair and fuck you six ways to Sunday.\u201d Wade confirmed. \u201cAnd when your heat comes in a few days, I\u2019m gonna bite the <i>shit </i>out of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so romantic, you make my heart flutter.\u201d Peter teased and Wade growled back at him. \u201cI love you, Alpha my Alpha. Don\u2019t you love me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you, Pete.\u201d Wade whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to make you mine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Alpha.\u201d Peter whispered back. \u201cI\u2019m already yours.\u201d </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>The internship at Stark Industries was everything Peter had ever imagined it would be, and he didn\u2019t know how Wade had managed to even get him an interview, but Peter had been here for just over a month and it was <i>everything </i>he had ever imagined it would be.</p><p>And then it all got even <i>better</i>, when Tony Stark showed up at his desk one day to ask questions about the line of suppressants Peter was working on. </p><p>\u201cSo, no negative side effects?\u201d The Alpha asked, flipping through Peter\u2019s work. \u201cBased off of blood types and specific biology markers? You know, this could be very expensive, manufacturing a different suppressant for every Omega out there. Expensive to the point of almost not viable.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt could be very expensive.\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cAnd lots of companies would take advantage of that, but a company as big as Stark Industries could afford to sell it at a lower price. Plus, if you provided it free of charge to the public health clinics and people on state insurance, then you\u2019d get enough of a tax break as to make it affordable even for people who don\u2019t have insurance, which means every Omega in the country could afford good suppressants which means we could work and go to school which only helps everything about the economy, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd also&ndash;\u201d Peter took a deep breath and kept right on talking, taking the surprised smile on the Alpha\u2019s face as permission. \u201c&ndash; since suddenly having Omegas able to work consistently will raise the numbers of the work force, you could offer more scholarships and open up more internships to bring the best out of the bigger classes here to SI.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve put a lot of thought into this.\u201d Mr. Stark said, scanning a few more pages quickly. \u201cRight up into my financial issues, hm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh well&ndash;\u201d Peter flushed nervously. \u201cI mean&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good.\u201d The Alpha handed him back the file. \u201cMy Omega Steve struggles with suppressant issues, mostly finding correct doses for his size that aren\u2019t toxic. Your ideas could change his life, not to mention the lives of several other Omega\u2019s that I personally know, and of course, literal millions of Omega\u2019s if your ideas actually work. </p><p>\u201cI&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch.\u201d Tony checked his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll buy, you can talk. Do you eat shawarma? It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re going to love it. Come on, lets go.\u201d </p><p>******************</p><p>Later that night over a dinner of steaks and vegetables, Peter was nearly bursting with information about his day, chattering as fast as he could and barely letting Wade get a word in edgewise, and Wade just grinned over it. </p><p>When he finally slowed down a little, Wade snarked&ndash; \u201cEnjoying the internship, are you?\u201d </p><p>The Omega launched himself towards his Alpha, burrowing into his lap and mouthing over his bonding mark and biting at him with soft trills and purrs. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d he muttered, squashing even closer. \u201cSo happy, Alpha. My life is everything I could ever want right now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s real good, Pete.\u201d Wade pretended to think for a minute. \u201cAnd all it took was bonding with me, right? We should bottle that and sell it on TV. Is true happiness just finding the right Alpha? Is really that easy?\u201d </p><p>Peter rolled his eyes, but his smile for his mate was very very soft. \u201cI guess it\u2019s really that easy.\u201d </p><p

You should be real proud of that.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>WADE</i>!\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>Even with Wade\u2019s less than stellar conversation skills, it had been a good heat and Peter was a happy, satisfied Omega. </p><p>He\u2019d be happier though, if the Alpha had finished what he\u2019d started so many times, and turned the bruises at Peter\u2019s bonding spot into a full fledged bite, finishing his claim. </p><p>In fact, Peter would have been happy if Wade had told him<i> I love you</i> back just once, but every time the Alpha had just tucked him close and kissed him breathless and left it alone. </p><p>It was fine. The Alpha wanted to take things slow and that was fine. Peter was a little thrown by just how quickly he was ready and willing to bond with Wade, considering how much he\u2019d balked at anything resembling settling down with Harry, and maybe it was <i>crazy </i>but it was also easy, <i>so easy</i> to be with Wade that Peter found himself wondering why he\u2019d wasted any time with any one else. </p><p>So they hadn\u2019t bonded yet. It was fine. </p><p>Wade didn\u2019t claim Peter the second heat together either, even though by that point he had moved the Omega out of the shitty studio apartment and into his shockingly nice place downtown. </p><p>\u201cUh yes, question?\u201d Peter asked the first time Wade brought him home to the high rise complex. \u201cWhy the fuck do you hang out at Weasel\u2019s if you have a place like this to come home to?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d Wade shrugged and dropped the one measly box of Peter\u2019s things in the bedroom closet. \u201cJust didn\u2019t feel right, didn\u2019t really feel like I belonged.\u201d His eyes flickered red then back to hazel as he looked Peter over with a possessive growl. \u201cDidn\u2019t feel like home yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peter\u2019s hand went unconsciously to his neck, scratching over the disappointingly clear skin. \u201cAnd now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cApparently all it took is a hot Omega with legs that don\u2019t quit to make it feel like home.\u201d Wade held out his hand and pulled Peter close, burying his nose in the thick hair and rumbling approvingly. \u201cM\u2019glad you\u2019re here, baby boy. Glad you wanted to move in with me.\u201d </p><p>They\u2019d gone shopping after that, shopping for everything from new sheets to dishes and curtains and then spent the rest of the weekend christening every available surface in the three bedroom apartment, teasing and laughing and saying \u201cI love you\u201d in a hundred different ways, but when Peter\u2019s heat came on, Wade still didn\u2019t bite him. </p><p>Well no, he bit him several times\u2013 at the juncture of hip and thigh just sharp enough to make Peter shriek, softer nibbles along Peter\u2019s jaw, harder in the meat of Peter\u2019s ass before Wade spread him open and took Peter apart with nothing more than his tongue and fingers\u2013</p><p>But not where Peter wanted him to, not where the Omega <i>needed </i>him to. </p><p>So before his third heat with Wade rolled around, Peter sat his Alpha down and just asked him point blank\u2013 \u201cWhy won\u2019t you bond with me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wade froze with a sandwich halfway to his mouth, right in the middle of carbo-loading to prepare for the next few days since neither of them remembered to eat anything other than granola bars during heat. \u201cWhat\u2013 what do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, this will be our third heat together.\u201d Peter pointed out. \u201cAnd before this, you helped me through three other ones, even if you weren\u2019t you know\u2013<i>helping </i>me. And I thought you\u2019d bite me the first time when you told me it wasn\u2019t just a trauma bond between us but you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought it was too soon.\u201d Wade swallowed a big bite and cleared his throat. \u201cOur first time\u2013 I didn\u2019t want you to regret it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell what about last time?\u201d Peter countered. \u201cYou moved me in here and I know you love me and I know you imprinted <i>mate </i>on me, and obviously I\u2013\u201d he blushed and Wade didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get used to how precious that was. \u201c\u2013obviously I\u2019m fine with it. Omega\u2019s don\u2019t imprint like you Alpha\u2019s do, but I always knew you were good for me, knew I was safe with you, right from the start.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, sweetheart.\u201d Wade\u2019s voice was a little hoarse and he cleared his throat again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you always knew you were safe with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d The Omega bit his lip and peeked up from his lashes shyly, knowing damn well his Alpha couldn\u2019t resist it, and Wade proved his point by just chucking the sandwich and grabbing Peter up into his lap. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you want to bond with me?\u201d </p><p>Wade sighed, sifting his Omega\u2019s hair through his fingers for a long minute as he though. \u201cPete, you don\u2019t want a mate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds fake, but okay.\u201d Peter frowned. \u201cWhy would you think I don\u2019t want a mate?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou left Harry because he wanted a bond and kids and all that sort of crap.\u201d Wade shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to assume you\u2019d change your mind for me. Just because you feel safe with me doesn\u2019t mean you want to deal with the glitter covered trash party that is my general self forever. And you\u2019re so incoherent during your heat, even if you asked me to bite you I\u2019d always feel like\u2013\u201d </p><p>He stopped, shook his head. \u201c\u2013I\u2019d always feel like I took advantage of you. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying during heat, in fact you should hear half the shit you say. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love all of it but if someone was listening\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf someone was listening?\u201d Peter interrupted, eyes sparking with laughter. \u201cAnd who exactly would be listening to the nonsense I say during my heat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuckin no one.\u201d Wade snarled, eyes red at even the thought of anyone ever hearing the way Peter talked during heat, anyone else being privy to moments that were meant to be between him and his <i>mate</i>. \u201cNo one else listens.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSuch a big scary Alpha.\u201d Peter pushed their foreheads together and growled playfully, reveling in the freedom he had to tease and push and just be <i>real </i>with his Alpha. It was another thing he hadn\u2019t realized he didn\u2019t have with Harry and he loved that he had it with Wade. </p><p>\u201cAnd by the way?\u201d he continued. \u201c\u201cI left Harry because he refused to get me suppressants so I could continue school. He tore up internship papers because he didn\u2019t want me working outside the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2013\u201d he inched closer, purring quietly when Wade put both arms around him. \u201c\u2013you\u2019ve gone out and got me suppressants for over six months now. Yesterday you wrote out a ridiculous sized check so I can go back to school for the spring semester. I turned down a job last month because it meant an hour subway ride each way, so you offered to buy me a car instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my mate, Pete.\u201d The Alpha\u2019s eyes shuttered a possessive shade of red again as he stroked his thumb over the bonding spot at the base of Peter\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna do whatever it takes to keep you happy, just like I did when we first met and just like I\u2019ve been trying to do the last few months. You\u2019re my mate whether there\u2019s a mark on you or not, it\u2019s enough for me Pete.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make it that easy?\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cYou\u2019d give up the security of a bond if you thought I didn\u2019t want it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make it that easy.\u201d Wade confirmed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try and tie you down like Harry did. I want you to be happy and that\u2019s my entire extensive thought process on the matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd if I wanted to be tied to you?\u201d There went Peter with that shy look again, all soft eyes and long lashes and hesitant smile. \u201cWhat about then? Would you still tell me no?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe hell I would. If I knew you wanted me as mate I\u2019d bend you over that chair and fuck you six ways to Sunday.\u201d Wade confirmed. \u201cAnd when your heat comes in a few days, I\u2019m gonna bite the <i>shit </i>out of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so romantic, you make my heart flutter.\u201d Peter teased and Wade growled back at him. \u201cI love you, Alpha my Alpha. Don\u2019t you love me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you, Pete.\u201d Wade whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to make you mine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Alpha.\u201d Peter whispered back. \u201cI\u2019m already yours.\u201d </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>The internship at Stark Industries was everything Peter had ever imagined it would be, and he didn\u2019t know how Wade had managed to even get him an interview, but Peter had been here for just over a month and it was <i>everything </i>he had ever imagined it would be.</p><p>And then it all got even <i>better</i>, when Tony Stark showed up at his desk one day to ask questions about the line of suppressants Peter was working on. </p><p>\u201cSo, no negative side effects?\u201d The Alpha asked, flipping through Peter\u2019s work. \u201cBased off of blood types and specific biology markers? You know, this could be very expensive, manufacturing a different suppressant for every Omega out there. Expensive to the point of almost not viable.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt could be very expensive.\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cAnd lots of companies would take advantage of that, but a company as big as Stark Industries could afford to sell it at a lower price. Plus, if you provided it free of charge to the public health clinics and people on state insurance, then you\u2019d get enough of a tax break as to make it affordable even for people who don\u2019t have insurance, which means every Omega in the country could afford good suppressants which means we could work and go to school which only helps everything about the economy, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd also\u2013\u201d Peter took a deep breath and kept right on talking, taking the surprised smile on the Alpha\u2019s face as permission. \u201c\u2013 since suddenly having Omegas able to work consistently will raise the numbers of the work force, you could offer more scholarships and open up more internships to bring the best out of the bigger classes here to SI.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve put a lot of thought into this.\u201d Mr. Stark said, scanning a few more pages quickly. \u201cRight up into my financial issues, hm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh well\u2013\u201d Peter flushed nervously. \u201cI mean\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good.\u201d The Alpha handed him back the file. \u201cMy Omega Steve struggles with suppressant issues, mostly finding correct doses for his size that aren\u2019t toxic. Your ideas could change his life, not to mention the lives of several other Omega\u2019s that I personally know, and of course, literal millions of Omega\u2019s if your ideas actually work. </p><p>\u201cI\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch.\u201d Tony checked his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll buy, you can talk. Do you eat shawarma? It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re going to love it. Come on, lets go.\u201d </p><p>******************</p><p>Later that night over a dinner of steaks and vegetables, Peter was nearly bursting with information about his day, chattering as fast as he could and barely letting Wade get a word in edgewise, and Wade just grinned over it. </p><p>When he finally slowed down a little, Wade snarked\u2013 \u201cEnjoying the internship, are you?\u201d </p><p>The Omega launched himself towards his Alpha, burrowing into his lap and mouthing over his bonding mark and biting at him with soft trills and purrs. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d he muttered, squashing even closer. \u201cSo happy, Alpha. My life is everything I could ever want right now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s real good, Pete.\u201d Wade pretended to think for a minute. \u201cAnd all it took was bonding with me, right? We should bottle that and sell it on TV. Is true happiness just finding the right Alpha? Is really that easy?\u201d </p><p>Peter rolled his eyes, but his smile for his mate was very very soft. \u201cI guess it\u2019s really that easy.\u201d </p><p

He woke up with a smile on his face though, glowing in the way that only post-heat Omega\u2019s did, eyes shining and skin flushed and it was a vast contrast to how completely fucked out Wade looked\u2013 exhausted and dehydrated and worn the hell out because <i>wow </i>did heat take a lot of energy.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cTo be fair\u2013\u201d he groaned when Peter jumped on the bed and clambered over to sit on Wade\u2019s waist. \u201cTo be fair, Alpha\u2019s gotta do all the work with this sort of thing. You just get to lay there and take knots. No wonder you aren\u2019t exhausted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI get to lay there and take knots?!\u201d Peter\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cAre you <i>serious </i>with that!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby boy.\u201d A jaw cracking yawn, and Wade yanked the Omega down to snuggle. \u201cYou take knots like a champ. You should be real proud of that.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>WADE</i>!\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>Even with Wade\u2019s less than stellar conversation skills, it had been a good heat and Peter was a happy, satisfied Omega. </p><p>He\u2019d be happier though, if the Alpha had finished what he\u2019d started so many times, and turned the bruises at Peter\u2019s bonding spot into a full fledged bite, finishing his claim. </p><p>In fact, Peter would have been happy if Wade had told him<i> I love you</i> back just once, but every time the Alpha had just tucked him close and kissed him breathless and left it alone. </p><p>It was fine. The Alpha wanted to take things slow and that was fine. Peter was a little thrown by just how quickly he was ready and willing to bond with Wade, considering how much he\u2019d balked at anything resembling settling down with Harry, and maybe it was <i>crazy </i>but it was also easy, <i>so easy</i> to be with Wade that Peter found himself wondering why he\u2019d wasted any time with any one else. </p><p>So they hadn\u2019t bonded yet. It was fine. </p><p>Wade didn\u2019t claim Peter the second heat together either, even though by that point he had moved the Omega out of the shitty studio apartment and into his shockingly nice place downtown. </p><p>\u201cUh yes, question?\u201d Peter asked the first time Wade brought him home to the high rise complex. \u201cWhy the fuck do you hang out at Weasel\u2019s if you have a place like this to come home to?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d Wade shrugged and dropped the one measly box of Peter\u2019s things in the bedroom closet. \u201cJust didn\u2019t feel right, didn\u2019t really feel like I belonged.\u201d His eyes flickered red then back to hazel as he looked Peter over with a possessive growl. \u201cDidn\u2019t feel like home yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peter\u2019s hand went unconsciously to his neck, scratching over the disappointingly clear skin. \u201cAnd now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cApparently all it took is a hot Omega with legs that don\u2019t quit to make it feel like home.\u201d Wade held out his hand and pulled Peter close, burying his nose in the thick hair and rumbling approvingly. \u201cM\u2019glad you\u2019re here, baby boy. Glad you wanted to move in with me.\u201d </p><p>They\u2019d gone shopping after that, shopping for everything from new sheets to dishes and curtains and then spent the rest of the weekend christening every available surface in the three bedroom apartment, teasing and laughing and saying \u201cI love you\u201d in a hundred different ways, but when Peter\u2019s heat came on, Wade still didn\u2019t bite him. </p><p>Well no, he bit him several times\u2013 at the juncture of hip and thigh just sharp enough to make Peter shriek, softer nibbles along Peter\u2019s jaw, harder in the meat of Peter\u2019s ass before Wade spread him open and took Peter apart with nothing more than his tongue and fingers\u2013</p><p>But not where Peter wanted him to, not where the Omega <i>needed </i>him to. </p><p>So before his third heat with Wade rolled around, Peter sat his Alpha down and just asked him point blank\u2013 \u201cWhy won\u2019t you bond with me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wade froze with a sandwich halfway to his mouth, right in the middle of carbo-loading to prepare for the next few days since neither of them remembered to eat anything other than granola bars during heat. \u201cWhat\u2013 what do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, this will be our third heat together.\u201d Peter pointed out. \u201cAnd before this, you helped me through three other ones, even if you weren\u2019t you know\u2013<i>helping </i>me. And I thought you\u2019d bite me the first time when you told me it wasn\u2019t just a trauma bond between us but you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought it was too soon.\u201d Wade swallowed a big bite and cleared his throat. \u201cOur first time\u2013 I didn\u2019t want you to regret it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell what about last time?\u201d Peter countered. \u201cYou moved me in here and I know you love me and I know you imprinted <i>mate </i>on me, and obviously I\u2013\u201d he blushed and Wade didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get used to how precious that was. \u201c\u2013obviously I\u2019m fine with it. Omega\u2019s don\u2019t imprint like you Alpha\u2019s do, but I always knew you were good for me, knew I was safe with you, right from the start.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, sweetheart.\u201d Wade\u2019s voice was a little hoarse and he cleared his throat again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you always knew you were safe with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d The Omega bit his lip and peeked up from his lashes shyly, knowing damn well his Alpha couldn\u2019t resist it, and Wade proved his point by just chucking the sandwich and grabbing Peter up into his lap. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you want to bond with me?\u201d </p><p>Wade sighed, sifting his Omega\u2019s hair through his fingers for a long minute as he though. \u201cPete, you don\u2019t want a mate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds fake, but okay.\u201d Peter frowned. \u201cWhy would you think I don\u2019t want a mate?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou left Harry because he wanted a bond and kids and all that sort of crap.\u201d Wade shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to assume you\u2019d change your mind for me. Just because you feel safe with me doesn\u2019t mean you want to deal with the glitter covered trash party that is my general self forever. And you\u2019re so incoherent during your heat, even if you asked me to bite you I\u2019d always feel like\u2013\u201d </p><p>He stopped, shook his head. \u201c\u2013I\u2019d always feel like I took advantage of you. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying during heat, in fact you should hear half the shit you say. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love all of it but if someone was listening\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf someone was listening?\u201d Peter interrupted, eyes sparking with laughter. \u201cAnd who exactly would be listening to the nonsense I say during my heat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuckin no one.\u201d Wade snarled, eyes red at even the thought of anyone ever hearing the way Peter talked during heat, anyone else being privy to moments that were meant to be between him and his <i>mate</i>. \u201cNo one else listens.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSuch a big scary Alpha.\u201d Peter pushed their foreheads together and growled playfully, reveling in the freedom he had to tease and push and just be <i>real </i>with his Alpha. It was another thing he hadn\u2019t realized he didn\u2019t have with Harry and he loved that he had it with Wade. </p><p>\u201cAnd by the way?\u201d he continued. \u201c\u201cI left Harry because he refused to get me suppressants so I could continue school. He tore up internship papers because he didn\u2019t want me working outside the home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2013\u201d he inched closer, purring quietly when Wade put both arms around him. \u201c\u2013you\u2019ve gone out and got me suppressants for over six months now. Yesterday you wrote out a ridiculous sized check so I can go back to school for the spring semester. I turned down a job last month because it meant an hour subway ride each way, so you offered to buy me a car instead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my mate, Pete.\u201d The Alpha\u2019s eyes shuttered a possessive shade of red again as he stroked his thumb over the bonding spot at the base of Peter\u2019s neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna do whatever it takes to keep you happy, just like I did when we first met and just like I\u2019ve been trying to do the last few months. You\u2019re my mate whether there\u2019s a mark on you or not, it\u2019s enough for me Pete.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make it that easy?\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cYou\u2019d give up the security of a bond if you thought I didn\u2019t want it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make it that easy.\u201d Wade confirmed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try and tie you down like Harry did. I want you to be happy and that\u2019s my entire extensive thought process on the matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd if I wanted to be tied to you?\u201d There went Peter with that shy look again, all soft eyes and long lashes and hesitant smile. \u201cWhat about then? Would you still tell me no?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe hell I would. If I knew you wanted me as mate I\u2019d bend you over that chair and fuck you six ways to Sunday.\u201d Wade confirmed. \u201cAnd when your heat comes in a few days, I\u2019m gonna bite the <i>shit </i>out of you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so romantic, you make my heart flutter.\u201d Peter teased and Wade growled back at him. \u201cI love you, Alpha my Alpha. Don\u2019t you love me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you, Pete.\u201d Wade whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to make you mine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Alpha.\u201d Peter whispered back. \u201cI\u2019m already yours.\u201d </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>The internship at Stark Industries was everything Peter had ever imagined it would be, and he didn\u2019t know how Wade had managed to even get him an interview, but Peter had been here for just over a month and it was <i>everything </i>he had ever imagined it would be.</p><p>And then it all got even <i>better</i>, when Tony Stark showed up at his desk one day to ask questions about the line of suppressants Peter was working on. </p><p>\u201cSo, no negative side effects?\u201d The Alpha asked, flipping through Peter\u2019s work. \u201cBased off of blood types and specific biology markers? You know, this could be very expensive, manufacturing a different suppressant for every Omega out there. Expensive to the point of almost not viable.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt could be very expensive.\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cAnd lots of companies would take advantage of that, but a company as big as Stark Industries could afford to sell it at a lower price. Plus, if you provided it free of charge to the public health clinics and people on state insurance, then you\u2019d get enough of a tax break as to make it affordable even for people who don\u2019t have insurance, which means every Omega in the country could afford good suppressants which means we could work and go to school which only helps everything about the economy, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd also\u2013\u201d Peter took a deep breath and kept right on talking, taking the surprised smile on the Alpha\u2019s face as permission. \u201c\u2013 since suddenly having Omegas able to work consistently will raise the numbers of the work force, you could offer more scholarships and open up more internships to bring the best out of the bigger classes here to SI.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve put a lot of thought into this.\u201d Mr. Stark said, scanning a few more pages quickly. \u201cRight up into my financial issues, hm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh well\u2013\u201d Peter flushed nervously. \u201cI mean\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good.\u201d The Alpha handed him back the file. \u201cMy Omega Steve struggles with suppressant issues, mostly finding correct doses for his size that aren\u2019t toxic. Your ideas could change his life, not to mention the lives of several other Omega\u2019s that I personally know, and of course, literal millions of Omega\u2019s if your ideas actually work. </p><p>\u201cI\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch.\u201d Tony checked his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll buy, you can talk. Do you eat shawarma? It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re going to love it. Come on, lets go.\u201d </p><p>******************</p><p>Later that night over a dinner of steaks and vegetables, Peter was nearly bursting with information about his day, chattering as fast as he could and barely letting Wade get a word in edgewise, and Wade just grinned over it. </p><p>When he finally slowed down a little, Wade snarked\u2013 \u201cEnjoying the internship, are you?\u201d </p><p>The Omega launched himself towards his Alpha, burrowing into his lap and mouthing over his bonding mark and biting at him with soft trills and purrs. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d he muttered, squashing even closer. \u201cSo happy, Alpha. My life is everything I could ever want right now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s real good, Pete.\u201d Wade pretended to think for a minute. \u201cAnd all it took was bonding with me, right? We should bottle that and sell it on TV. Is true happiness just finding the right Alpha? Is really that easy?\u201d </p><p>Peter rolled his eyes, but his smile for his mate was very very soft. \u201cI guess it\u2019s really that easy.\u201d </p><p

He woke up with a smile on his face though, glowing in the way that only post-heat Omega&rsquo;s did, eyes shining and skin flushed and it was a vast contrast to how completely fucked out Wade looked&ndash; exhausted and dehydrated and worn the hell out because <i>wow </i>did heat take a lot of energy.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;To be fair&ndash;&rdquo; he groaned when Peter jumped on the bed and clambered over to sit on Wade&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;To be fair, Alpha&rsquo;s gotta do all the work with this sort of thing. You just get to lay there and take knots. No wonder you aren&rsquo;t exhausted.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I get to lay there and take knots?!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s mouth fell open. &ldquo;Are you <i>serious </i>with that!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, baby boy.&rdquo; A jaw cracking yawn, and Wade yanked the Omega down to snuggle. &ldquo;You take knots like a champ. You should be real proud of that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>WADE</i>!&rdquo; </p><p>Even with Wade&rsquo;s less than stellar conversation skills, it had been a good heat and Peter was a happy, satisfied Omega. </p><p>He&rsquo;d be happier though, if the Alpha had finished what he&rsquo;d started so many times, and turned the bruises at Peter&rsquo;s bonding spot into a full fledged bite, finishing his claim. </p><p>In fact, Peter would have been happy if Wade had told him<i> I love you</i> back just once, but every time the Alpha had just tucked him close and kissed him breathless and left it alone. </p><p>It was fine. The Alpha wanted to take things slow and that was fine. Peter was a little thrown by just how quickly he was ready and willing to bond with Wade, considering how much he&rsquo;d balked at anything resembling settling down with Harry, and maybe it was <i>crazy </i>but it was also easy, <i>so easy</i> to be with Wade that Peter found himself wondering why he&rsquo;d wasted any time with any one else. </p><p>So they hadn&rsquo;t bonded yet. It was fine. </p><p>Wade didn&rsquo;t claim Peter the second heat together either, even though by that point he had moved the Omega out of the shitty studio apartment and into his shockingly nice place downtown. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh yes, question?&rdquo; Peter asked the first time Wade brought him home to the high rise complex. &ldquo;Why the fuck do you hang out at Weasel&rsquo;s if you have a place like this to come home to?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo; Wade shrugged and dropped the one measly box of Peter&rsquo;s things in the bedroom closet. &ldquo;Just didn&rsquo;t feel right, didn&rsquo;t really feel like I belonged.&rdquo; His eyes flickered red then back to hazel as he looked Peter over with a possessive growl. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t feel like home yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s hand went unconsciously to his neck, scratching over the disappointingly clear skin. &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Apparently all it took is a hot Omega with legs that don&rsquo;t quit to make it feel like home.&rdquo; Wade held out his hand and pulled Peter close, burying his nose in the thick hair and rumbling approvingly. &ldquo;M&rsquo;glad you&rsquo;re here, baby boy. Glad you wanted to move in with me.&rdquo; </p><p>They&rsquo;d gone shopping after that, shopping for everything from new sheets to dishes and curtains and then spent the rest of the weekend christening every available surface in the three bedroom apartment, teasing and laughing and saying &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; in a hundred different ways, but when Peter&rsquo;s heat came on, Wade still didn&rsquo;t bite him. </p><p>Well no, he bit him several times&ndash; at the juncture of hip and thigh just sharp enough to make Peter shriek, softer nibbles along Peter&rsquo;s jaw, harder in the meat of Peter&rsquo;s ass before Wade spread him open and took Peter apart with nothing more than his tongue and fingers&ndash;</p><p>But not where Peter wanted him to, not where the Omega <i>needed </i>him to. </p><p>So before his third heat with Wade rolled around, Peter sat his Alpha down and just asked him point blank&ndash; &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you bond with me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Wade froze with a sandwich halfway to his mouth, right in the middle of carbo-loading to prepare for the next few days since neither of them remembered to eat anything other than granola bars during heat. &ldquo;What&ndash; what do you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, this will be our third heat together.&rdquo; Peter pointed out. &ldquo;And before this, you helped me through three other ones, even if you weren&rsquo;t you know&ndash;<i>helping </i>me. And I thought you&rsquo;d bite me the first time when you told me it wasn&rsquo;t just a trauma bond between us but you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was too soon.&rdquo; Wade swallowed a big bite and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Our first time&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t want you to regret it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well what about last time?&rdquo; Peter countered. &ldquo;You moved me in here and I know you love me and I know you imprinted <i>mate </i>on me, and obviously I&ndash;&rdquo; he blushed and Wade didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever get used to how precious that was. &ldquo;&ndash;obviously I&rsquo;m fine with it. Omega&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t imprint like you Alpha&rsquo;s do, but I always knew you were good for me, knew I was safe with you, right from the start.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, sweetheart.&rdquo; Wade&rsquo;s voice was a little hoarse and he cleared his throat again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you always knew you were safe with me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo; The Omega bit his lip and peeked up from his lashes shyly, knowing damn well his Alpha couldn&rsquo;t resist it, and Wade proved his point by just chucking the sandwich and grabbing Peter up into his lap. &ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you want to bond with me?&rdquo; </p><p>Wade sighed, sifting his Omega&rsquo;s hair through his fingers for a long minute as he though. &ldquo;Pete, you don&rsquo;t want a mate.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sounds fake, but okay.&rdquo; Peter frowned. &ldquo;Why would you think I don&rsquo;t want a mate?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You left Harry because he wanted a bond and kids and all that sort of crap.&rdquo; Wade shrugged. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to assume you&rsquo;d change your mind for me. Just because you feel safe with me doesn&rsquo;t mean you want to deal with the glitter covered trash party that is my general self forever. And you&rsquo;re so incoherent during your heat, even if you asked me to bite you I&rsquo;d always feel like&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>He stopped, shook his head. &ldquo;&ndash;I&rsquo;d always feel like I took advantage of you. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying during heat, in fact you should hear half the shit you say. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love all of it but if someone was listening&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If someone was listening?&rdquo; Peter interrupted, eyes sparking with laughter. &ldquo;And who exactly would be listening to the nonsense I say during my heat?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuckin no one.&rdquo; Wade snarled, eyes red at even the thought of anyone ever hearing the way Peter talked during heat, anyone else being privy to moments that were meant to be between him and his <i>mate</i>. &ldquo;No one else listens.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Such a big scary Alpha.&rdquo; Peter pushed their foreheads together and growled playfully, reveling in the freedom he had to tease and push and just be <i>real </i>with his Alpha. It was another thing he hadn&rsquo;t realized he didn&rsquo;t have with Harry and he loved that he had it with Wade. </p><p>&ldquo;And by the way?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;&ldquo;I left Harry because he refused to get me suppressants so I could continue school. He tore up internship papers because he didn&rsquo;t want me working outside the home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&ndash;&rdquo; he inched closer, purring quietly when Wade put both arms around him. &ldquo;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve gone out and got me suppressants for over six months now. Yesterday you wrote out a ridiculous sized check so I can go back to school for the spring semester. I turned down a job last month because it meant an hour subway ride each way, so you offered to buy me a car instead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my mate, Pete.&rdquo; The Alpha&rsquo;s eyes shuttered a possessive shade of red again as he stroked his thumb over the bonding spot at the base of Peter&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m gonna do whatever it takes to keep you happy, just like I did when we first met and just like I&rsquo;ve been trying to do the last few months. You&rsquo;re my mate whether there&rsquo;s a mark on you or not, it&rsquo;s enough for me Pete.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make it that easy?&rdquo; Peter whispered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d give up the security of a bond if you thought I didn&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d make it that easy.&rdquo; Wade confirmed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to try and tie you down like Harry did. I want you to be happy and that&rsquo;s my entire extensive thought process on the matter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And if I wanted to be tied to you?&rdquo; There went Peter with that shy look again, all soft eyes and long lashes and hesitant smile. &ldquo;What about then? Would you still tell me no?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The hell I would. If I knew you wanted me as mate I&rsquo;d bend you over that chair and fuck you six ways to Sunday.&rdquo; Wade confirmed. &ldquo;And when your heat comes in a few days, I&rsquo;m gonna bite the <i>shit </i>out of you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so romantic, you make my heart flutter.&rdquo; Peter teased and Wade growled back at him. &ldquo;I love you, Alpha my Alpha. Don&rsquo;t you love me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Pete.&rdquo; Wade whispered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to make you mine.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours, Alpha.&rdquo; Peter whispered back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already yours.&rdquo; </p><p>*******************</p><p>*******************</p><p>The internship at Stark Industries was everything Peter had ever imagined it would be, and he didn&rsquo;t know how Wade had managed to even get him an interview, but Peter had been here for just over a month and it was <i>everything </i>he had ever imagined it would be.</p><p>And then it all got even <i>better</i>, when Tony Stark showed up at his desk one day to ask questions about the line of suppressants Peter was working on. </p><p>&ldquo;So, no negative side effects?&rdquo; The Alpha asked, flipping through Peter&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;Based off of blood types and specific biology markers? You know, this could be very expensive, manufacturing a different suppressant for every Omega out there. Expensive to the point of almost not viable.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It could be very expensive.&rdquo; Peter nodded. &ldquo;And lots of companies would take advantage of that, but a company as big as Stark Industries could afford to sell it at a lower price. Plus, if you provided it free of charge to the public health clinics and people on state insurance, then you&rsquo;d get enough of a tax break as to make it affordable even for people who don&rsquo;t have insurance, which means every Omega in the country could afford good suppressants which means we could work and go to school which only helps everything about the economy, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And also&ndash;&rdquo; Peter took a deep breath and kept right on talking, taking the surprised smile on the Alpha&rsquo;s face as permission. &ldquo;&ndash; since suddenly having Omegas able to work consistently will raise the numbers of the work force, you could offer more scholarships and open up more internships to bring the best out of the bigger classes here to SI.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought into this.&rdquo; Mr. Stark said, scanning a few more pages quickly. &ldquo;Right up into my financial issues, hm?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh well&ndash;&rdquo; Peter flushed nervously. &ldquo;I mean&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; The Alpha handed him back the file. &ldquo;My Omega Steve struggles with suppressant issues, mostly finding correct doses for his size that aren&rsquo;t toxic. Your ideas could change his life, not to mention the lives of several other Omega&rsquo;s that I personally know, and of course, literal millions of Omega&rsquo;s if your ideas actually work. </p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have lunch.&rdquo; Tony checked his watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy, you can talk. Do you eat shawarma? It doesn&rsquo;t matter, you&rsquo;re going to love it. Come on, lets go.&rdquo; </p><p>******************</p><p>Later that night over a dinner of steaks and vegetables, Peter was nearly bursting with information about his day, chattering as fast as he could and barely letting Wade get a word in edgewise, and Wade just grinned over it. </p><p>When he finally slowed down a little, Wade snarked&ndash; &ldquo;Enjoying the internship, are you?&rdquo; </p><p>The Omega launched himself towards his Alpha, burrowing into his lap and mouthing over his bonding mark and biting at him with soft trills and purrs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy.&rdquo; he muttered, squashing even closer. &ldquo;So happy, Alpha. My life is everything I could ever want right now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s real good, Pete.&rdquo; Wade pretended to think for a minute. &ldquo;And all it took was bonding with me, right? We should bottle that and sell it on TV. Is true happiness just finding the right Alpha? Is really that easy?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter rolled his eyes, but his smile for his mate was very very soft. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s really that easy.&rdquo;

He woke up with a smile on his face though, glowing in the way that only post-heat Omega&rsquo;s did, eyes shining and skin flushed and it was a vast contrast to how completely fucked out Wade looked&ndash; exhausted and dehydrated and worn the hell out because <i>wow </i>did heat take a lot of energy.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;To be fair&ndash;&rdquo; he groaned when Peter jumped on the bed and clambered over to sit on Wade&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;To be fair, Alpha&rsquo;s gotta do all the work with this sort of thing. You just get to lay there and take knots. No wonder you aren&rsquo;t exhausted.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I get to lay there and take knots?!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s mouth fell open. &ldquo;Are you <i>serious </i>with that!&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, baby boy.&rdquo; A jaw cracking yawn, and Wade yanked the Omega down to snuggle. &ldquo;You take knots like a champ. You should be real proud of that.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>WADE</i>!&rdquo; </p>\n</p>",

Paparazzi was hounding you as you tried to walk to your car. Today you were gonna go down to the studio and read with some guys for the role of Spiderman. You had heard of a few of em, but some of them you couldn\u2019t even remember their names. </p><p>For you it was just a normal, annoying day of work. What with your role of Iron girl and all? It was kind of cool getting to work with your dad and everything, even playing his genius daughter in one of the best movie series there is. But with the contract came other things, like getting up at the crack of dawn so you could go read a script with someone you\u2019ve never heard of. \u00a0</p><p>You went to meet up with your dad in the green room, but when you walked in, you saw a line of the guys in line to play Spiderman. One of them caught your eye, he was a bit taller than you with dark curly hair. His eyes were dark brown too and you could swear you saw your own reflection in them. You turned around to keep walking and one of the managers came and ushered you through to your dad. </p><p>\u201cHey, where were you?\u201d he asked, enveloping you in a hug. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI got caught by paps before I could leave. Chased me down to my car.\u201d you smiled. One of the assistants came in the room holding two pieces of paper. One was for you and the other was for your dad. You quickly read over it, seeing how your character, Kayla, otherwise known as Kay, is all of a sudden going to be the love interest for the new Spiderman. Well then, this seems like an odd turn of events. After the last movie, your character was already in a relationship. Either way you just wanted to get it over with so you could go home and watch Star Wars. </p><p>\u201cShall we get to it?\u201d you asked your dad. He quickly nodded and you were taken to separate rooms, with several boys already in each of them. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the manager said, \u201cFirst up on the list is BUtterfield, Asa.\u201d </p><p>You definetly knew this name. Honestly you were kind of a fan. Asa put so much into every character he played and you were sure that it was almost no competition. He would definitely get it. Of course he wasn&rsquo;t traditionally as attractive as the other boys in the room. Most certainly not as much as the boy you saw earlier. You tried to scan the room for him again and found his dark brown eyes again. He gave you a small smile and nod of his head before another pair of eyes blocked your vision.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey there.&rdquo; Asa reached out his hand for you to shake and you gladly took it, returning him a smile as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey. I&rsquo;m gonna be honest. I&rsquo;m a fan.&rdquo; You giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? A fan? Of me?&rdquo; You nodded to him again and his eyes widened a bit. &ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m a fan of you.&rdquo; He laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then this should be fun.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>After Asa&rsquo;s read, you were convinced they would send everyone else home because it was really good. The chemistry between you two was actually great. However there was still something that the casting directors were looking for that wasn&rsquo;t there with Asa.</p><p>Even though Asa&rsquo;s audition was still the best, they kept having you read with the other boys. You kind of got bored with them until they called up the boy you saw earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Holland, Thomas.&rdquo;</p><p>He walked over to you with a nervous smile, reaching his hand out for you. You shook it and smiled back. You could feel his hand shaking when you touched it. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m Tom.&rdquo; He had an accent like Asa. Must be English. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He replied, his smile had grown and he became more comfortable as his hand stopped shaking. Wait. Why were you still holding his hand. You both dropped you hands at the realization and started over to the camera area.</p><p>By the time he had gone, you had the page memorized and so did he.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, take it from the top but ignore Robert&rsquo;s lines.&rdquo; He nodded and they gave you guys the signal that the camera was rolling.</p><p>&ldquo;You know something? I um, I haven&rsquo;t introduced myself. I-I&rsquo;m Peter. Peter Parker.&rdquo; His accent was now that of a Queens or Brooklyn type and it impressed you how good it sounded. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I guessed as much, my dad said you were gonna be hanging around here for a while.&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t tear yourself from his eyes. It was almost unnatural and seemed unprofessional. Still you guys kept going.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh he did? Did he tell you about about my internship?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, something along the lines of you also being a superhero.&rdquo; You smiled and smirked, giving him the sense of sarcasm.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you know.&rdquo; His shoulders dropped a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;About you being the friendly neighborhood spider-guy? Yeah.&rdquo; You turned around as scripted, laughing as you took a step.</p><p>&ldquo;Its actually Spiderman.&rdquo; He mumbled to which you stopped in your tracks. You turned around.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like 12.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;15.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m 16.&rdquo; You retored, placing your hands on your hips. </p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m older than you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means I&rsquo;ll call you spider guy if I want to.&rdquo; You smiled cheekily. </p><p>He looked slightly annoyed and flustered.</p><p>He looked back down to his feet and didn&rsquo;t seem to have anything else to say. Good.</p><p>&ldquo;See ya later Spiderman.&rdquo;</p><p>You turned and walked away. Unbeknownst to you he was smiling at your last words.</p><p>The director yelled cut and then it all hit you. That wasn&rsquo;t real. It sure did feel real. Wow. That kid was good.</p><p>You guys said your goodbyes and then you were taken back to the green room. After Tom they sent the rest of the guys home. They said that they had all they needed for consideration.</p><p>-</p><p>A few weeks later you were notified that the new spiderman was posted on Instagram. </p><p>You opened insta and clear as day Tom&rsquo;s name was posted.</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t surprised that Asa&rsquo;s name wasn&rsquo;t up there. His performance was good but Tom&rsquo;s was so good you thought it was real.</p><p>You were really excited to be working with him. You honestly thought he was attractive and he seemed to think you were too. Maybe on set he might happen to ask you out or something? Who knows? </p><p>Finally the day came for the first shots with you and Tom. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of filming going on with you two though so you two just kind of thing out in each other&rsquo;s trailers, getting to know each other. The next few weeks went just the same. Filming scenes and then hanging out. </p><p>He was really funny. And cute. And over all a great guy in general. He also had a really cute dog back at home in England, which for you, was a big bonus. You love dogs. His dog was a grey staffie named tessa and was absolutely adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I uh, wanted to ask you if uh maybe you might wanna see a movie with me tomorrow night. I figured cause we both have tomorrow off it might be fun.&rdquo; He got a little but quieter as his anxiety took over.</p><p>&ldquo;I would love to.&rdquo; His head shot up and he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; He started looking at your lips then back at your eyes. You both started leaning in and before you knew it, he closed the gap between you. Not only was this boy the epitome of perfect. He was also a great kisser. </p><p>You both started moving your lips in sync and before either of you knew it, you were straddling his hips, hands on his face and his in your hair.</p><p>All of a sudden your trailer door swung open.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n- hey! What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; You dad walked in and you looked up at him in terror. So did Tom. He looked absolutely mortified.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad we um-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I get it. Tom you better watch yourself.&rdquo; He said to which you crawled off Tom. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir. I was..&rdquo; he trailed off. There really wasn&rsquo;t a good excuse for what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I really need to get a babysitter for you two?&rdquo; He joked, walking over to sit by you.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not going to have to worry about anything am I?&rdquo; He asked, to which you shook your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay cool. I was going to send someone to get coffee I didn&rsquo;t know if you wanted anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually dad, I think I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that he was off.

Paparazzi was hounding you as you tried to walk to your car. Today you were gonna go down to the studio and read with some guys for the role of Spiderman. You had heard of a few of em, but some of them you couldn\u2019t even remember their names. </p><p>For you it was just a normal, annoying day of work. What with your role of Iron girl and all? It was kind of cool getting to work with your dad and everything, even playing his genius daughter in one of the best movie series there is. But with the contract came other things, like getting up at the crack of dawn so you could go read a script with someone you\u2019ve never heard of. \u00a0</p><p>You went to meet up with your dad in the green room, but when you walked in, you saw a line of the guys in line to play Spiderman. One of them caught your eye, he was a bit taller than you with dark curly hair. His eyes were dark brown too and you could swear you saw your own reflection in them. You turned around to keep walking and one of the managers came and ushered you through to your dad. </p><p>\u201cHey, where were you?\u201d he asked, enveloping you in a hug. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI got caught by paps before I could leave. Chased me down to my car.\u201d you smiled. One of the assistants came in the room holding two pieces of paper. One was for you and the other was for your dad. You quickly read over it, seeing how your character, Kayla, otherwise known as Kay, is all of a sudden going to be the love interest for the new Spiderman. Well then, this seems like an odd turn of events. After the last movie, your character was already in a relationship. Either way you just wanted to get it over with so you could go home and watch Star Wars. </p><p>\u201cShall we get to it?\u201d you asked your dad. He quickly nodded and you were taken to separate rooms, with several boys already in each of them. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the manager said, \u201cFirst up on the list is BUtterfield, Asa.\u201d </p><p>You definetly knew this name. Honestly you were kind of a fan. Asa put so much into every character he played and you were sure that it was almost no competition. He would definitely get it. Of course he wasn\u2019t traditionally as attractive as the other boys in the room. Most certainly not as much as the boy you saw earlier. You tried to scan the room for him again and found his dark brown eyes again. He gave you a small smile and nod of his head before another pair of eyes blocked your vision.</p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d Asa reached out his hand for you to shake and you gladly took it, returning him a smile as well.</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m gonna be honest. I\u2019m a fan.\u201d You giggled.</p><p>\u201cReally? A fan? Of me?\u201d You nodded to him again and his eyes widened a bit. \u201cBut, I\u2019m a fan of you.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell then this should be fun.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>After Asa\u2019s read, you were convinced they would send everyone else home because it was really good. The chemistry between you two was actually great. However there was still something that the casting directors were looking for that wasn\u2019t there with Asa.</p><p>Even though Asa\u2019s audition was still the best, they kept having you read with the other boys. You kind of got bored with them until they called up the boy you saw earlier.</p><p>\u201cHolland, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to you with a nervous smile, reaching his hand out for you. You shook it and smiled back. You could feel his hand shaking when you touched it. </p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Tom.\u201d He had an accent like Asa. Must be English. </p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He replied, his smile had grown and he became more comfortable as his hand stopped shaking. Wait. Why were you still holding his hand. You both dropped you hands at the realization and started over to the camera area.</p><p>By the time he had gone, you had the page memorized and so did he.</p><p>\u201cAlright, take it from the top but ignore Robert\u2019s lines.\u201d He nodded and they gave you guys the signal that the camera was rolling.</p><p>\u201cYou know something? I um, I haven\u2019t introduced myself. I-I\u2019m Peter. Peter Parker.\u201d His accent was now that of a Queens or Brooklyn type and it impressed you how good it sounded. </p><p>\u201cYeah I guessed as much, my dad said you were gonna be hanging around here for a while.\u201d You couldn\u2019t tear yourself from his eyes. It was almost unnatural and seemed unprofessional. Still you guys kept going.</p><p>\u201cOh he did? Did he tell you about about my internship?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, something along the lines of you also being a superhero.\u201d You smiled and smirked, giving him the sense of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you know.\u201d His shoulders dropped a bit.</p><p>\u201cAbout you being the friendly neighborhood spider-guy? Yeah.\u201d You turned around as scripted, laughing as you took a step.</p><p>\u201cIts actually Spiderman.\u201d He mumbled to which you stopped in your tracks. You turned around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like 12.\u201d You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201c15.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m 16.\u201d You retored, placing your hands on your hips. </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m older than you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhich means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019ll call you spider guy if I want to.\u201d You smiled cheekily. </p><p>He looked slightly annoyed and flustered.</p><p>He looked back down to his feet and didn\u2019t seem to have anything else to say. Good.</p><p>\u201cSee ya later Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>You turned and walked away. Unbeknownst to you he was smiling at your last words.</p><p>The director yelled cut and then it all hit you. That wasn\u2019t real. It sure did feel real. Wow. That kid was good.</p><p>You guys said your goodbyes and then you were taken back to the green room. After Tom they sent the rest of the guys home. They said that they had all they needed for consideration.</p><p>-</p><p>A few weeks later you were notified that the new spiderman was posted on Instagram. </p><p>You opened insta and clear as day Tom\u2019s name was posted.</p><p>You weren\u2019t surprised that Asa\u2019s name wasn\u2019t up there. His performance was good but Tom\u2019s was so good you thought it was real.</p><p>You were really excited to be working with him. You honestly thought he was attractive and he seemed to think you were too. Maybe on set he might happen to ask you out or something? Who knows? </p><p>Finally the day came for the first shots with you and Tom. There wasn\u2019t a lot of filming going on with you two though so you two just kind of thing out in each other\u2019s trailers, getting to know each other. The next few weeks went just the same. Filming scenes and then hanging out. </p><p>He was really funny. And cute. And over all a great guy in general. He also had a really cute dog back at home in England, which for you, was a big bonus. You love dogs. His dog was a grey staffie named tessa and was absolutely adorable.</p><p>\u201cHey, I uh, wanted to ask you if uh maybe you might wanna see a movie with me tomorrow night. I figured cause we both have tomorrow off it might be fun.\u201d He got a little but quieter as his anxiety took over.</p><p>\u201cI would love to.\u201d His head shot up and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d He started looking at your lips then back at your eyes. You both started leaning in and before you knew it, he closed the gap between you. Not only was this boy the epitome of perfect. He was also a great kisser. </p><p>You both started moving your lips in sync and before either of you knew it, you were straddling his hips, hands on his face and his in your hair.</p><p>All of a sudden your trailer door swung open.</p><p>\u201cY/n- hey! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d You dad walked in and you looked up at him in terror. So did Tom. He looked absolutely mortified.</p><p>\u201cDad we um-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I get it. Tom you better watch yourself.\u201d He said to which you crawled off Tom. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir. I was..\u201d he trailed off. There really wasn\u2019t a good excuse for what was happening.</p><p>\u201cDo I really need to get a babysitter for you two?\u201d He joked, walking over to sit by you.</p><p>\u201cI am not going to have to worry about anything am I?\u201d He asked, to which you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cOkay cool. I was going to send someone to get coffee I didn\u2019t know if you wanted anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually dad, I think I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>And with that he was off. He left your trailer door open so you went over and shut it.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d you trailed off, looking at Tom. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d </p><h2>- Tags-</h2><h1><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkhiyoDZaEsVuCR54E7D-rA\">@frogmoutholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEDrWQqVrzS8Bra4ly5uU-w\">@parkeret</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqLl0ejJDMoaJw31Etn_-g\">@letsgetfuckingsuperwholocked</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFObkVMIk7X1FPDuTv9riUw\">@letitbefiction</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO4sKu-bNAJn7CaEo2a2Ozg\">@built4broadway</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrsLnAcj7FbNVWTYnNDv9-w\">@dean-the-smol-bean</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0grQLJzEgTqrFMkW2BQeIA\">@donttellpeterparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHq62L049STfdlTXHEJk0lA\">@ivvitm1109</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7r9zYIQBdQvtnzrtg4SwXw\">@rainywagonpicklemug</a> </h1></p>",

Idek anymore but like no swearing for once.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Being RDJ&rsquo;s daughter was about as good as it sounded, therefore it was also as bad as it sounded. Paparazzi was hounding you as you tried to walk to your car. Today you were gonna go down to the studio and read with some guys for the role of Spiderman. You had heard of a few of em, but some of them you couldn&rsquo;t even remember their names. </p><p>For you it was just a normal, annoying day of work. What with your role of Iron girl and all? It was kind of cool getting to work with your dad and everything, even playing his genius daughter in one of the best movie series there is. But with the contract came other things, like getting up at the crack of dawn so you could go read a script with someone you&rsquo;ve never heard of. &nbsp;</p><p>You went to meet up with your dad in the green room, but when you walked in, you saw a line of the guys in line to play Spiderman. One of them caught your eye, he was a bit taller than you with dark curly hair. His eyes were dark brown too and you could swear you saw your own reflection in them. You turned around to keep walking and one of the managers came and ushered you through to your dad. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, where were you?&rdquo; he asked, enveloping you in a hug. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I got caught by paps before I could leave. Chased me down to my car.&rdquo; you smiled. One of the assistants came in the room holding two pieces of paper. One was for you and the other was for your dad. You quickly read over it, seeing how your character, Kayla, otherwise known as Kay, is all of a sudden going to be the love interest for the new Spiderman. Well then, this seems like an odd turn of events. After the last movie, your character was already in a relationship. Either way you just wanted to get it over with so you could go home and watch Star Wars. </p><p>&ldquo;Shall we get to it?&rdquo; you asked your dad. He quickly nodded and you were taken to separate rooms, with several boys already in each of them. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; the manager said, &ldquo;First up on the list is BUtterfield, Asa.&rdquo; </p><p>You definetly knew this name. Honestly you were kind of a fan. Asa put so much into every character he played and you were sure that it was almost no competition. He would definitely get it. Of course he wasn&rsquo;t traditionally as attractive as the other boys in the room. Most certainly not as much as the boy you saw earlier. You tried to scan the room for him again and found his dark brown eyes again. He gave you a small smile and nod of his head before another pair of eyes blocked your vision.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey there.&rdquo; Asa reached out his hand for you to shake and you gladly took it, returning him a smile as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey. I&rsquo;m gonna be honest. I&rsquo;m a fan.&rdquo; You giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? A fan? Of me?&rdquo; You nodded to him again and his eyes widened a bit. &ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m a fan of you.&rdquo; He laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then this should be fun.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>After Asa&rsquo;s read, you were convinced they would send everyone else home because it was really good. The chemistry between you two was actually great. However there was still something that the casting directors were looking for that wasn&rsquo;t there with Asa.</p><p>Even though Asa&rsquo;s audition was still the best, they kept having you read with the other boys. You kind of got bored with them until they called up the boy you saw earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Holland, Thomas.&rdquo;</p><p>He walked over to you with a nervous smile, reaching his hand out for you. You shook it and smiled back. You could feel his hand shaking when you touched it. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m Tom.&rdquo; He had an accent like Asa. Must be English. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He replied, his smile had grown and he became more comfortable as his hand stopped shaking. Wait. Why were you still holding his hand. You both dropped you hands at the realization and started over to the camera area.</p><p>By the time he had gone, you had the page memorized and so did he.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, take it from the top but ignore Robert&rsquo;s lines.&rdquo; He nodded and they gave you guys the signal that the camera was rolling.</p><p>&ldquo;You know something? I um, I haven&rsquo;t introduced myself. I-I&rsquo;m Peter. Peter Parker.&rdquo; His accent was now that of a Queens or Brooklyn type and it impressed you how good it sounded. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I guessed as much, my dad said you were gonna be hanging around here for a while.&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t tear yourself from his eyes. It was almost unnatural and seemed unprofessional. Still you guys kept going.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh he did? Did he tell you about about my internship?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, something along the lines of you also being a superhero.&rdquo; You smiled and smirked, giving him the sense of sarcasm.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you know.&rdquo; His shoulders dropped a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;About you being the friendly neighborhood spider-guy? Yeah.&rdquo; You turned around as scripted, laughing as you took a step.</p><p>&ldquo;Its actually Spiderman.&rdquo; He mumbled to which you stopped in your tracks. You turned around.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like 12.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;15.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m 16.&rdquo; You retored, placing your hands on your hips. </p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m older than you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means I&rsquo;ll call you spider guy if I want to.&rdquo; You smiled cheekily. </p><p>He looked slightly annoyed and flustered.</p><p>He looked back down to his feet and didn&rsquo;t seem to have anything else to say. Good.</p><p>&ldquo;See ya later Spiderman.&rdquo;</p><p>You turned and walked away. Unbeknownst to you he was smiling at your last words.</p><p>The director yelled cut and then it all hit you. That wasn&rsquo;t real. It sure did feel real. Wow. That kid was good.</p><p>You guys said your goodbyes and then you were taken back to the green room. After Tom they sent the rest of the guys home. They said that they had all they needed for consideration.</p><p>-</p><p>A few weeks later you were notified that the new spiderman was posted on Instagram. </p><p>You opened insta and clear as day Tom&rsquo;s name was posted.</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t surprised that Asa&rsquo;s name wasn&rsquo;t up there. His performance was good but Tom&rsquo;s was so good you thought it was real.</p><p>You were really excited to be working with him. You honestly thought he was attractive and he seemed to think you were too. Maybe on set he might happen to ask you out or something? Who knows? </p><p>Finally the day came for the first shots with you and Tom. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of filming going on with you two though so you two just kind of thing out in each other&rsquo;s trailers, getting to know each other. The next few weeks went just the same. Filming scenes and then hanging out. </p><p>He was really funny. And cute. And over all a great guy in general. He also had a really cute dog back at home in England, which for you, was a big bonus. You love dogs. His dog was a grey staffie named tessa and was absolutely adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I uh, wanted to ask you if uh maybe you might wanna see a movie with me tomorrow night. I figured cause we both have tomorrow off it might be fun.&rdquo; He got a little but quieter as his anxiety took over.</p><p>&ldquo;I would love to.&rdquo; His head shot up and he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; He started looking at your lips then back at your eyes. You both started leaning in and before you knew it, he closed the gap between you. Not only was this boy the epitome of perfect. He was also a great kisser. </p><p>You both started moving your lips in sync and before either of you knew it, you were straddling his hips, hands on his face and his in your hair.</p><p>All of a sudden your trailer door swung open.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n- hey! What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; You dad walked in and you looked up at him in terror. So did Tom. He looked absolutely mortified.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad we um-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I get it. Tom you better watch yourself.&rdquo; He said to which you crawled off Tom. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir. I was..&rdquo; he trailed off. There really wasn&rsquo;t a good excuse for what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I really need to get a babysitter for you two?&rdquo; He joked, walking over to sit by you.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not going to have to worry about anything am I?&rdquo; He asked, to which you shook your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay cool. I was going to send someone to get coffee I didn&rsquo;t know if you wanted anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually dad, I think I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that he was off.
