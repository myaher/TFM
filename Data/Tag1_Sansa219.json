        "question": "Can we just talk for 5 secs about how useless the ramsay/sansa r*pe scene was. Horrifying. Disgusting plot line. At the end of S4 we saw a stronger savvy Sansa and then she becomes a victim again. Why tf did she agree to marry ramsay? Why didn\u2019t she just insist on waiting till stannis came to take back Winterfell? remember baelish said stannis would come so why couldn\u2019t she have just waited it out at the Vale? It was a useless plot line that continued for shock value",

At least, not dainty prim and proper princesses with ideals who enjoy cake and fashion and want a cute husband. They need those ideals and frivolous things tortured out of them.</p><p>Sansa liked the court life and romance better than what d&amp;d think heroines should enjoy, and worse, she romantically and sexually rejected their favorite character, so she needed to be Taught a Lesson to realize how <i>good</i> she at it before, with a true gentlesir as a husband, and back in her dreary home where her siblings made fun of her and her dad all but ignored her and nobody related to her interests. What better way to do that than shove her into Ramsay&rsquo;s grasp? </p><p>Also, they were five seasons in and probably just running out of ways to effectively ~shock people, so they went back to the ol&rsquo; tried-and-true way of letting women get sexually abused. </p><p>I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir here but it&rsquo;s just glorified (and terrible) fanfiction at this point.

When they had left Winterfell her uniform had still fitted perfectly, but now it was getting a little too tight. She was growing. She was growing from a girl into a woman.</p><p>And Jon had no idea how to handle it. Every time he looked at her, he felt a strange kinda warmth spreading through his entire body and parts of him were reacting in an almost embarrassing way. \u201cOw, yes, undoubtedly.\u201d He nodded firmly and he licked his dry lips while he tried to focus on his study book instead of Sansa. </p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Sansa leaned towards him and Jon was forced to look up. She probably had no idea what she did to him. She didn\u2019t know that tilting her head like that almost drove him crazy. And she couldn\u2019t know either. What if she thought it was weird or stupid? What if she never wanted anything to do with him anymore?</p><p>Jon shrugged. \u201cEuh\u2026\u201d He quickly turned a few pages. His mind was entirely blank. He couldn\u2019t come up with a useful thing to say, with an answer that made sense. \u201cWhich one would you want?\u201d </p><p>It was a tactic Robb had taught him and surprisingly enough it always seemed to be working. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! There are way too many awesome ones!\u201d Her enthusiasm was contagious and Jon felt a smile spreading across his face. \u201cI think Nifflers look pretty cute, but I fear that I will never be able to find my necklaces and earrings anymore. I\u2019d totally hate that.

I got the impression that we had\nsome conditions to be met before our King bends the knee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Conditions?&rdquo; Daenerys asks, looking between Sansa and\nJon. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember there being any conditions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Sansa continues innocently. &ldquo;Nothing about\ndefeating the enemy to the north?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The enemy <i>will be </i>defeated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear that, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you still refuse to acknowledge my dominion, is\nthat it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be our Queen soon enough. My brother\nstrongly believes in your capability to defeat the Night King, and I trust him\ncompletely.&rdquo; She can hear Jon exhaling loudly behind her but she doesn&rsquo;t turn.\n&ldquo;We have the chambers prepared for you and your company. I imagine you would like\nto retire and warm up before we call a meeting. Lord Tyrion, lord Varys,&rdquo; she\nturns to Daenerys&rsquo; advisers, &ldquo;I am glad to see you alive and well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Likewise, lady Stark,&rdquo; Varys says sweetly. &ldquo;Look how\ntall you gotten, fair as the moon, yet hard as steel. You remind me of your\nlady Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>Years have passed, and somehow it still hurts Sansa to\nthink of her. How many times has she woken up, scared and cold, and wished\nCatelyn Stark could be there to braid her hair, or kiss her forehead? How many\ntimes has she swallowed the tears and held her head high, thinking: &ldquo;Mother wouldn&rsquo;t\ncry. Mother would be stronger&rdquo;?</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, lord Varys. That&rsquo;s very kind of you,&rdquo; she\nhears herself answering in a calm, dispassionate tone.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s gloved hand brushes against her forearm as he\ntakes a step forward to stand alongside her.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold outside, and we are all tired. Let&rsquo;s leave\nall the small talk for a later time.&rdquo;</p><p>As everybody rushes towards the castle, Sansa dares\nherself to look at Daenerys again, and finds her still gazing at Sansa with hostility.</p><p>Jon won&rsquo;t be happy about how she treated his future\nqueen and wife, Sansa is sure he will confront her as soon as they are left\nalone. Something inside her yearns for that confrontation&ndash;oh, there are so many\nthings she wants to yell at him for.</p><p>She refuses to move even after the last person\nvanishes behind the heavy castle doors, trying to decide what her next step should\nbe. The lords will not accept this, they will not accept <i>her</i>, Sansa doesn&rsquo;t\ndoubt it in the slightest. Is her role as the Lady of Winterfell to stand\nbehind them and try and enforce their wishes? Or does she sacrifice the northern\nindependence for the greater good?</p><p><i>What would Father do?</i></p><p>Jon clears his throat and takes a step towards her,\nshe can feel his warm breath on her neck when he leans in and whispers into her\near: &ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice comes out colder than the icy wind when she\nanswers: &ldquo;Then talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My solar?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After you.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s all quiet and polite, very ladylike of her, very\nkingly of him. But they both know they are now sailing towards a storm&ndash;and it\nwill be loud, and brutal, and destructive. They know that even though they will\nboth get out of it alive, they will never be the same.</p><p>Her heels echo across the empty halls. She doesn&rsquo;t\nlook back.</p>",

In an ideal situation their relationship should be a simple brother and sister dynamic but it\u2019s not. Their history and the circumstances they face make it anything but that and it\u2019s \u201cmessy and complicated.\u201d </p><p>For Jon I\u2019ve always been on the fence about whether or not his feelings are subconscious or if he\u2019s fully aware about how he feels about Sansa. Right now, I think he\u2019s somewhere in between the two. I think he\u2019s fully aware about the affect Sansa has on him but is deeply conflicted about his feelings and tries to ignore them or pass it off. The thing is Jon struggles to hide how he feels and his feelings tend to manifest in times that should make any audience raise their eyebrow.  The moments that particularly stick out to me are all the encounters he\u2019s had with Sansa\u2019s male suitors, both battlement scenes, the tent scene and the North is Yours scene. </p><p>I think in these moments it really shows Jon not only manifesting his true feelings for Sansa but also I think it shows that Jon himself being surprised by the wave emotions he has for her and how much she truly affects hims.</p><p>Thanks for the ask.</p>",
