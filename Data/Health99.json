I still bench the same baby weights that I did when I started out.</p> <p>Any tips?</p> </div><br><br>\nSubmitted February 12, 2019 at 03:11AM by rmonik<br>\nvia reddit <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2SLuMA2\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2SLuMA2</a></p>",

A mammogram &ndash; a low-dose X-ray image of the breast &ndash; is considered by medical professionals to be the gold standard for screening for breast cancer.</p><p>\u201cPatients who undergo a thermography test alone should not be reassured of the findings,\u201d a public statement issued by the FDA in 2017 reads. \u201cThermography has not been shown to be effective as a standalone test for either breast cancer screening or diagnosis in detecting early stage breast cancer.&ldquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"342\" data-orig-width=\"608\" data-orig-src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/linda-greg-abc-jef-190208_hpEmbed_16x9_608.jpg\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d061055cf86847eebcbb5985010bcc0/tumblr_inline_pnz3cm6KuY1tuwonz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"342\" data-orig-width=\"608\" data-orig-src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/linda-greg-abc-jef-190208_hpEmbed_16x9_608.jpg\"/></figure><p>According to an article titled \u201cHarmonizing Breast Cancer Screening Recommendations: Metrics and Accountability\u201d published in the American Journal of Roentgenology, \u201cThe American Cancer Society states that no study has ever shown that it is an effective tool for detecting breast cancer. Both the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) do not endorse thermography for detecting clinically occult breast cancer.\u201d</p><p>But in 2018, Hayes allowed ABC News producers to film her pitch at a business expo. Hayes told them \u201cno one needs a mammogram,\u201d regardless of whether they\u2019ve had a thermal reading. A brochure she distributed at the event advertises thermography as a first and potentially life-saving step toward detecting cancer. \u201cShare with your friends &amp; family that there is an alternative to mammography that &hellip; is far more efficient at detecting cancer,\u201d it reads.</p><p>Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the acting chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, is skeptical of these statements.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-disparities-black-women-white-women-die-58494016\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: Black women more likely than white women to die from breast cancer in the US)</a></p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know anyone who I consider a credible resource or expert who would suggest that thermography in the absence of a mammogram or another breast cancer detection test is adequate to save lives,\u201d Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>After the interview with ABC News, Total Thermal said that it changed its brochures.</p><h3>When thermography wasn&rsquo;t enough</h3><p>\u201cPeople have looked at thermography as an early detection tool. The data just doesn&rsquo;t support it as being effective,\u201d Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society said. \u201cYou have to show that it works. Otherwise, you end up in situations where people believe it, they don&rsquo;t get the test that&rsquo;s been proven to be beneficial, and the results may speak for themselves.\u201d</p><p>Alma Arciniegas\u2019 family said the result of her reliance on thermography was devastating.

When she returned to Total Thermal four months after her initial scan, her symptoms had grown dramatically worse.</p><p>&ldquo;All of the sudden, I just said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m such a fool. Why did I even come here?&rsquo;&rdquo; Delain said, adding that she refused another set of scans.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/promising-drug-aggressive-stage-iv-breast-cancer-encounters-60458201\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: Promising new drug for aggressive stage IV breast cancer encounters setback)</a></p><p>In an interview, we showed Melvin Delain&rsquo;s report from 2012. He said he did not remember Delain, but that her report displayed &ldquo;significant findings.&rdquo; When asked why he didn&rsquo;t make an immediate referral with those findings, he said that they must wait three months to do a comparative scan to understand the results.</p><p>Melvin later told ABC News via email that Delain didn&rsquo;t follow his recommendations, did not return for a follow-up to the initial examination in three months and pointed out a line at the bottom of the intake form: &ldquo;The report will not tell me whether I have an illness, disease, or other condition.&rdquo;</p><p>Unemployed and uninsured, Delain said it took her several more months to get an appointment for a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/breast-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">mammogram</a>, and then a biopsy, and then a diagnosis: Stage 3 breast cancer.</p><h3>A diagnosis in need of a cure</h3><p>Thermography is approved by the FDA for breast cancer screening, but only when used with what the administration considers a primary test, like mammography. A mammogram &ndash; a low-dose X-ray image of the breast &ndash; is considered by medical professionals to be the gold standard for screening for breast cancer.</p><p>&ldquo;Patients who undergo a thermography test alone should not be reassured of the findings,&rdquo; a public statement issued by the FDA in 2017 reads. &ldquo;Thermography has not been shown to be effective as a standalone test for either breast cancer screening or diagnosis in detecting early stage breast cancer.&ldquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d061055cf86847eebcbb5985010bcc0/tumblr_inline_pnz3cm6KuY1tuwonz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>According to an article titled &ldquo;Harmonizing Breast Cancer Screening Recommendations: Metrics and Accountability&rdquo; published in the American Journal of Roentgenology, &ldquo;The American Cancer Society states that no study has ever shown that it is an effective tool for detecting breast cancer. Both the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) do not endorse thermography for detecting clinically occult breast cancer.&rdquo;</p><p>But in 2018, Hayes allowed ABC News producers to film her pitch at a business expo. Hayes told them &ldquo;no one needs a mammogram,&rdquo; regardless of whether they&rsquo;ve had a thermal reading. A brochure she distributed at the event advertises thermography as a first and potentially life-saving step toward detecting cancer. &ldquo;Share with your friends &amp; family that there is an alternative to mammography that &hellip; is far more efficient at detecting cancer,&rdquo; it reads.</p><p>Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the acting chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, is skeptical of these statements.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-disparities-black-women-white-women-die-58494016\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: Black women more likely than white women to die from breast cancer in the US)</a></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anyone who I consider a credible resource or expert who would suggest that thermography in the absence of a mammogram or another breast cancer detection test is adequate to save lives,&rdquo; Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>After the interview with ABC News, Total Thermal said that it changed its brochures.</p><h3>When thermography wasn&rsquo;t enough</h3><p>&ldquo;People have looked at thermography as an early detection tool. The data just doesn&rsquo;t support it as being effective,&rdquo; Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society said. &ldquo;You have to show that it works. Otherwise, you end up in situations where people believe it, they don&rsquo;t get the test that&rsquo;s been proven to be beneficial, and the results may speak for themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>Alma Arciniegas&rsquo; family said the result of her reliance on thermography was devastating. She went to a different thermography practitioner in Northern California that is not affiliated with Total Thermal Imaging.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/sandra-lee-reveals-cameras-film-battle-breast-cancer-58277148\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: Sandra Lee reveals why she let cameras film her battle with breast cancer)</a></p><p>&ldquo;She told me after, very excited, &lsquo;Oh, I went and got checked out. All clear,&rsquo;&rdquo; her son Camillo Mejilla, 25, remembered.</p><p>But six months after her screening, she received the same diagnosis as Delain &ndash; Stage 3 breast cancer. However, her prognosis was much worse.</p><p>The cancer quickly spread to Arciniegas&rsquo; brain, severely limiting her ability to talk and perform other basic tasks.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b95760ea78fef85b3e10ee7e74bf20d1/tumblr_inline_pnz3cnD5IT1tuwonz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure>Mejilla watched as his vivacious mother became feeble. She struggled to climb the stairs and became unable to answer even simple questions.<p>She was 55 when she died in 2015.</p><p>Her friend and attorney, Robert Cartwright, said he believes she didn&rsquo;t have to lose that fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Alma would be here with us today if she had not relied on the results of her thermogram,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Before Arciniegas died, she sued her thermography clinic and the manufacturer of the thermal imaging camera it used. The case was eventually settled, with the defendants denying any wrongdoing.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/pay-forward-chain-started-nicu-nurses-mom-facing-59140120\" target=\"_blank\">(MORE: Nurses donate breast milk to mom with breast cancer)</a></p><p>&ldquo;Despite the fact that she couldn&rsquo;t talk much, she could say, &lsquo;I love you,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mejilla recalled, adding that those were the last words she said to him.</p><p>Delain, meanwhile, endured years of surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation after her diagnosis. But she said those dark days revealed internal fortitude.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m just stronger than I thought I was, because I&rsquo;m standing here now,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Delain is now cancer free and has this advice for anyone who finds themselves in her situation: &ldquo;Get a biopsy. It&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo;</p><p>Doctors may not always perform a biopsy on a lump in the breast, depending on <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Suggested-algorithm-for-the-work-up-of-a-unilateral-breast-mass-in-men-FNA-fine-needle_fig2_11212199\" target=\"_blank\">such factors as the woman&rsquo;s age and other risk factors</a>, but it is important to listen to your body when something feels wrong, and to see a doctor and consider seeing a second to get an additional opinion.</p>",

As with other systems in the body, the endocrine system consists of an intricate feedback loop. When running properly, the result is healthy hormone levels and healthy functioning of the organs and body as a whole. However, when a disruption occurs or the system ceases to operate as it should, the result can be quite damaging. In men, perhaps the most notable hormone of concern is testosterone, a hormone that is critical to sexual health as well as digestion, weight management, and the retention of bone density and muscle mass. When testosterone levels dip below normal, the results can be severe and widespread. Some of the most noted issues include: \u2022 weight gain and increased BMI \u2022 loss of muscle mass \u2022 fatigue \u2022 no sex drive \u2022 erectile dysfunction \u2022 depression \u2022 gynecomastia \u2022 osteoporosis It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that low testosterone doesn&rsquo;t always present itself with symptoms. In fact, hormonal issues can exist for quite some time before it can become apparent. This is why frequent checkups and monitoring are so essential to ensure that any issues are caught early. This way, proper treatment can be begun before problems arise. It&rsquo;s truly incredible how far reaching the effects of low testosterone can be. While the effect it has on libido and sexual performance may be more obvious, there are other issues that while not as apparent, can also cause incredibly serious problems. The mental impacts of low testosterone are perhaps some of the least discussed, yet are of extreme importance. When &ldquo;free&rdquo; testosterone diminishes within the body, cognitive decline is not uncommon. Not only this, but even typically mild mannered men can experience anger management issues and increased anxiety. This can have significant impacts not only on oneself, but on relationships at home and in the workplace as well. Dr. Mikhail Berman, as a licensed and experienced hormone replacement specialist, is well versed in all aspects of the endocrine system. He provides a unique approach to treatment that includes both hormone treatments as well as natural methods, such as diet changes, in order to yield the best possible results for patients. He firmly believes that while aging and glandular conditions may be difficult, there is no reason why men should have to suffer unnecessarily. His commitment to his patients and his desire to offer the very best treatments has made him a go-to physician in Palm Beach Gardens for men who are dealing with testosterone and hormone issues. Schedule a Consultation No one should have to go through each day feeling as though they are missing out on the best life has to offer. Whether you&rsquo;re in your 30s, 40s, or beyond, you should know that there is no reason for you to feel like a victim of age. Instead, Dr. Berman is dedicated to helping his patients of all ages feel youthful, virile, and energetic. If you believe that you are dealing with low testosterone or you&rsquo;re concerned that your overall hormone levels may be &ldquo;off&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t wait to seek out the care you need.
