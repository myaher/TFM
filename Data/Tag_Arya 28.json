        "body": "<h1>Arya Stark and Compulsory Femininity: How D&amp;D Exploited Her Character</h1><p>Dan and David are sending an incredibly dangerous message with how they wrote Arya Stark in <i>both </i>season seven and season eight, and especially in how they wrote Arya in relation to Sansa.\u00a0</p><p>We know from the books that:\u00a0</p><ul><li>It is <i>Jon and Arya\u2019s </i>relationship that has immense significance, not Sansa and Jon\u2019s. In fact, in the books, Jon did not have a great relationship with Sansa, because she went along with Catelyn\u2019s exclusion of him.\u00a0</li><li>The wolf symbolism is significant to all the Stark children, of course, but it is especially significant to Arya. The line\u00a0\u201cthe lone wolf dies but the pack survives\u201d is what Ned tells Arya<i> </i>in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.\u00a0</li><li>Arya\u2019s goal is to get home, to be with her family again. It is not to become a world-class assassin. She goes through vital experiences that should hopefully and eventually lead her back home, to her family, to the people who love her.\u00a0</li><li>Arya interacts with people regardless of their occupation or their feudal status. This is significant for someone who is high-born. There are very few characters in the books who actually care about and interact with the smallfolk to a significant degree, and Arya is one of them. She is open-minded and open-hearted.\u00a0</li><li>Arya cares about women and her biggest heroes are warrior women such as Nymeria of the Rhoyne and Visenya Targaryen.\u00a0</li><li>She does not spurn feudal femininity because she has\u00a0\u201cinternalized misogyny\u201d or because she thinks she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cbetter\u201d than Sansa. Rather, Arya has always been an intelligent, curious, and defiant girl. She is always questioning what goes on around her, always questioning the norms and expectations that dictate feudal life, and does not blindly accept or abide by the notion that her path has to have a set destiny that conforms to femininity.\u00a0</li><li>Arya\u2019s relationship with Sansa is complicated. Obviously they care about each other, but Sansa has caused a lot of hurt toward Arya. Sansa finds Arya\u2019s behaviors to be discomforting, strange, stupid, and even dirty.\u00a0</li><li>\u201cSansa knew about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with <i>anybody</i>. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher\u2019s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya seemed to prefer his company to hers.\u201d - Sansa I, A Game of Thrones</li><li>\u201cSansa lifted her head.\u00a0\u2018It will be a <i>splendid </i>event. You shan\u2019t be wanted.\u2019\u201c - Arya II, A Game of Thrones</li><li>Arya is very lonely on the King\u2019s Road and in King\u2019s Landing because she finds it difficult to make friends with people who won\u2019t allow her to be herself. Her relationship with Sansa also makes this more challenging, as she feels as if people think of Sansa are more of a proper lady than she is. This is an important part of Arya\u2019s early characterization - her loneliness gives rise to empathy.\u00a0</li><li>When Sansa and Arya do reunite in ASOIAF, it\u2019s going to take more than a hug and some conversation for these early childhood wounds to heal. It\u2019s going to take mutual dialogue and it\u2019s going to take time. We know that at this point in ASOIAF, Sansa has evolved to a point where she understands why her earlier behaviors were wrong, and where she is praying for home as well, but that won\u2019t be enough to make up for the early hurt and loneliness she caused Arya. Arya also reacted in kind, no doubt about that, but for them to reach a mutual level of love, trust, and respect will require that Sansa acknowledges why her earlier behaviors were wrong.\u00a0</li><li>Arya makes many friends and many allies, and does not espouse cliquey, exclusive, or xenophobic behavior. She hates the Lannisters, and she hates their\u00a0\u201ceveryone but us is an enemy\u201d mentality. She is one of the first people early on in A Game of Thrones who identified that the Lannisters are rotten to their core.\u00a0</li><li>Arya has a very strong and close relationship with Gendry, and clearly has feelings for him.\u00a0</li><li>George R.

Essentially, Arya\u2019s intelligence is minimized to prop Sansa up as the character we should all be listening to.

Instead, completely isolating her from her family once again, making her journey circular.\u00a0</li></ul><p>This serves an important purpose of the message D&amp;D are sending. They are essentially stating that a woman like Arya, who interacts with people regardless of occupation or status in a feudal era, and who is intelligent and actively questions and defies compulsory femininity and the gendered norms of her time, is not fit for family, or for home, or for love, or for leadership. She is good enough to be an emotionless robot that kills her enemies in empowering moments, but she is not good enough for retaking or ruling Winterfell, or to stay by her family\u2019s side, or to find happiness with the man she loves. Yes, she will never be a\u00a0\u201clady\u201d in the conventional sense of the word. But if D&amp;D had shown Arya ruling the Stormlands with Gendry by her side, they could\u2019ve actually subverted expectations in a positive manner. They could\u2019ve shown that a woman who is not conventionally feminine can still be both a strong leader and someone with a husband and a family. Just as they didn\u2019t really change the feudal system, though, they of course wouldn\u2019t show such a takedown of Westerosi patriarchy. The woman who gets to Rule the North is not only the older sister of the King, making her status gained through oligarchic nepotism; it is also the woman who is conventionally beautiful, who has always wanted to be a Queen/a Lady, who embraces femininity instead of questioning it, and who has not been shown to befriend or engage with smallfolk and low-born people.\u00a0</p><p>This message is extremely deliberate. They demonized Arya in season 7 to make Sansa seem smarter and yet to prompt fans to view Sansa as someone who still can do no wrong and who\u2019s just treated so meany even by her own sister, and gosh we have to defend her and protect her because she\u2019s so precious and pure and soft and sensitive and fragile BUT she\u2019s also strong and empowered and cleverer than Arya and Arya could NEVER survive what Sansa went through. It\u2019s no wonder that so many fans of Sansa despised Arya in s7. Yet those same fans only began loving Arya again when Arya executed Sansa\u2019s enemy, Petyr, and later when she became Arya\u2019s mouthpiece in s8. I even saw some people, when the Winterfell Crypts promo for s8 came out, that Arya and Jon are like guards that are defending their queen Sansa. This exploitation of Arya\u2019s character to treat her as a prop for Sansa\u2019s sake, and then claiming that this is a celebration of empowering sisterly love, is directly the result of the theme D&amp;D have embodied, which is that a\u00a0\u201cgood\u201d woman, a\u00a0\u201cfeminist\u201d woman, a woman who is meant to be a leader, is feminine, and that women who are not feminine are anti-woman, who are not capable of experiencing or surviving trauma (and in this case trauma is a code for sexualized violence against women), and that they are not deserving of love or male desire because they just wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u00a0</p><p>On the question of sexual violence or abuse: D&amp;D have Sansa state that Arya wouldn\u2019t survive what she went through because it is a norm in our society that only feminine women experience sexual violence or abuse, and that more gender non-conforming women are somehow incapable of experiencing or surviving sexual violence. It goes back to the notion that rape and assault only happen to pretty, conventionally attractive white women, which is a myth that white supremacist patriarchy has created and maintained. Arya has gone through a lot, just as much as Sansa and the other Starklings have, and to have two women argue about who could survive trauma is disgusting, especially by ending it saying that the gnc woman couldn\u2019t possibly understand what the feminine woman went through.</p><p>We already know that it is still expected of women, in this day and age, to be feminine. We already know that gender non-conforming women are looked down upon, and that the misogyny they experience is treated as non-existent or not as important, and that they are seen as having\u00a0\u201cprivilege\u201d over feminine women, even though they actually suffer unique marginalization as a result of being gender non-conforming. Yet D&amp;D have the interest of upholding patriarchal dictates, which is why they went for the ending they did with Arya. They are teaching people a lesson here: if you\u2019re a girl who defies femininity and makes friends with all sorts of diverse people regardless of class or birth status, you\u2019re not a good or pure ideal woman and you\u2019re never going to find the love that you want, and instead you will be isolated and only be good enough for doing the dirty work for other people. Arya is not allowed to rule, or to be with her siblings, or to marry Gendry, because she is positioned as an\u00a0\u201canti-femininity\u201d subject; and women who dare to defy or question femininity are punished, both by fictional narratives and by dominant patriarchal culture. It isn\u2019t even just that D&amp;D love Sansa; it\u2019s that they actively want to uphold the message that women like Arya are\u00a0\u201cstrange and weird creatures\u201d who need to be shipped away from us, lest they bring ruin upon our patriarchal society.\u00a0</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>Arya Stark and Compulsory Femininity: How D&amp;D Exploited Her Character</h1><p>Dan and David are sending an incredibly dangerous message with how they wrote Arya Stark in <i>both </i>season seven and season eight, and especially in how they wrote Arya in relation to Sansa.\u00a0</p><p>We know from the books that:\u00a0</p><ul><li>It is <i>Jon and Arya\u2019s </i>relationship that has immense significance, not Sansa and Jon\u2019s. In fact, in the books, Jon did not have a great relationship with Sansa, because she went along with Catelyn\u2019s exclusion of him.\u00a0</li><li>The wolf symbolism is significant to all the Stark children, of course, but it is especially significant to Arya. The line\u00a0\u201cthe lone wolf dies but the pack survives\u201d is what Ned tells Arya<i> </i>in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.\u00a0</li><li>Arya\u2019s goal is to get home, to be with her family again. It is not to become a world-class assassin. She goes through vital experiences that should hopefully and eventually lead her back home, to her family, to the people who love her.\u00a0</li><li>Arya interacts with people regardless of their occupation or their feudal status. This is significant for someone who is high-born. There are very few characters in the books who actually care about and interact with the smallfolk to a significant degree, and Arya is one of them. She is open-minded and open-hearted.\u00a0</li><li>Arya cares about women and her biggest heroes are warrior women such as Nymeria of the Rhoyne and Visenya Targaryen.\u00a0</li><li>She does not spurn feudal femininity because she has\u00a0\u201cinternalized misogyny\u201d or because she thinks she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cbetter\u201d than Sansa. Rather, Arya has always been an intelligent, curious, and defiant girl. She is always questioning what goes on around her, always questioning the norms and expectations that dictate feudal life, and does not blindly accept or abide by the notion that her path has to have a set destiny that conforms to femininity.\u00a0</li><li>Arya\u2019s relationship with Sansa is complicated. Obviously they care about each other, but Sansa has caused a lot of hurt toward Arya. Sansa finds Arya\u2019s behaviors to be discomforting, strange, stupid, and even dirty.\u00a0</li><li>\u201cSansa knew about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with <i>anybody</i>. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher\u2019s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya seemed to prefer his company to hers.\u201d - Sansa I, A Game of Thrones</li><li>\u201cSansa lifted her head.\u00a0\u2018It will be a <i>splendid </i>event. You shan\u2019t be wanted.\u2019\u201c - Arya II, A Game of Thrones</li><li>Arya is very lonely on the King\u2019s Road and in King\u2019s Landing because she finds it difficult to make friends with people who won\u2019t allow her to be herself. Her relationship with Sansa also makes this more challenging, as she feels as if people think of Sansa are more of a proper lady than she is. This is an important part of Arya\u2019s early characterization - her loneliness gives rise to empathy.\u00a0</li><li>When Sansa and Arya do reunite in ASOIAF, it\u2019s going to take more than a hug and some conversation for these early childhood wounds to heal. It\u2019s going to take mutual dialogue and it\u2019s going to take time. We know that at this point in ASOIAF, Sansa has evolved to a point where she understands why her earlier behaviors were wrong, and where she is praying for home as well, but that won\u2019t be enough to make up for the early hurt and loneliness she caused Arya. Arya also reacted in kind, no doubt about that, but for them to reach a mutual level of love, trust, and respect will require that Sansa acknowledges why her earlier behaviors were wrong.\u00a0</li><li>Arya makes many friends and many allies, and does not espouse cliquey, exclusive, or xenophobic behavior. She hates the Lannisters, and she hates their\u00a0\u201ceveryone but us is an enemy\u201d mentality. She is one of the first people early on in A Game of Thrones who identified that the Lannisters are rotten to their core.\u00a0</li><li>Arya has a very strong and close relationship with Gendry, and clearly has feelings for him.\u00a0</li><li>George R. R. Martin stated that there are five key characters: Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Bran Stark, Arya Stark, and Tyrion Lannister.\u00a0</li><li>Across all five currently released books, Arya has 33 viewpoint chapters while Sansa has 24 viewpoint chapters.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Let\u2019s look at what the show has done to Arya in comparison:</p><ul><li>Minimized the importance of Jon and Arya\u2019s relationship and given more emotionally significant scenes to Jon and Sansa</li><li>Gave Sansa more importance/more scenes than Arya\u00a0</li><li>Didn\u2019t show Jon reacting particularly emotionally in season 7 to the letter bearing news that Bran and Arya have returned to Winterfell\u00a0</li><li>Made Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion partially about Sansa\u00a0</li><li>Showed Sansa ruling by Jon\u2019s side in Winterfell, and not any scene of Arya specifically ruling by his side\u00a0</li><li>Gave\u00a0\u201cthe lone wolf dies but the pack survives\u201d line to Sansa\u00a0</li><li>Turned Arya from a curious, inquisitive, kind girl into a sullen, introverted, emotionless assassin who is only good for killing the enemies we want to see killed\u00a0</li><li>Arya exterminates House Frey \u2013&gt; Jon gets total credit for avenging the Red Wedding\u00a0</li><li>Arya executes Petyr Baelish \u2013&gt; Sansa gets credit for\u00a0\u201ccoming up with the scheme\u201d, even though we know that Petyr was actually manipulating her to the point that Sansa did believe Arya was going to kill her until Bran had to tell her the truth, and without Bran\u2019s powers, no one would\u2019ve known the truth about Petyr\u00a0</li><li>Arya kills the Night King \u2013&gt; is not even present in the victory feast that\u2019s held in her honor</li><li>Prompted people to desire for Arya to kill Cersei and, later, Daenerys\u00a0</li><li>Places an exaggerated emphasis on Arya\u2019s list which prompts fans and certain male cast members to call her a psychopath\u00a0</li><li>Arya spent seven seasons trying to get back home to Winterfell, only to end up leaving Westeros to sail West and possibly discover new lands, in spite of the fact that without her, Winterfell would have been overrun by the NK and his army\u00a0</li><li>Turned Arya from someone who cares about people, especially other women, who likes having friends, who is open-minded, and who looks up to warrior women, into a xenophobe who apparently only serves as Sansa\u2019s mouthpiece.

In fact, in the books, Jon did not have a great relationship with Sansa, because she went along with Catelyn\u2019s exclusion of him.\u00a0</li><li>The wolf symbolism is significant to all the Stark children, of course, but it is especially significant to Arya. The line\u00a0\u201cthe lone wolf dies but the pack survives\u201d is what Ned tells Arya<i> </i>in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.\u00a0</li><li>Arya\u2019s goal is to get home, to be with her family again. It is not to become a world-class assassin. She goes through vital experiences that should hopefully and eventually lead her back home, to her family, to the people who love her.\u00a0</li><li>Arya interacts with people regardless of their occupation or their feudal status. This is significant for someone who is high-born. There are very few characters in the books who actually care about and interact with the smallfolk to a significant degree, and Arya is one of them. She is open-minded and open-hearted.\u00a0</li><li>Arya cares about women and her biggest heroes are warrior women such as Nymeria of the Rhoyne and Visenya Targaryen.\u00a0</li><li>She does not spurn feudal femininity because she has\u00a0\u201cinternalized misogyny\u201d or because she thinks she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cbetter\u201d than Sansa. Rather, Arya has always been an intelligent, curious, and defiant girl. She is always questioning what goes on around her, always questioning the norms and expectations that dictate feudal life, and does not blindly accept or abide by the notion that her path has to have a set destiny that conforms to femininity.\u00a0</li><li>Arya\u2019s relationship with Sansa is complicated. Obviously they care about each other, but Sansa has caused a lot of hurt toward Arya. Sansa finds Arya\u2019s behaviors to be discomforting, strange, stupid, and even dirty.\u00a0</li><li>\u201cSansa knew about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with <i>anybody</i>. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher\u2019s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya seemed to prefer his company to hers.\u201d - Sansa I, A Game of Thrones</li><li>\u201cSansa lifted her head.\u00a0\u2018It will be a <i>splendid </i>event. You shan\u2019t be wanted.\u2019\u201c - Arya II, A Game of Thrones</li><li>Arya is very lonely on the King\u2019s Road and in King\u2019s Landing because she finds it difficult to make friends with people who won\u2019t allow her to be herself. Her relationship with Sansa also makes this more challenging, as she feels as if people think of Sansa are more of a proper lady than she is. This is an important part of Arya\u2019s early characterization - her loneliness gives rise to empathy.\u00a0</li><li>When Sansa and Arya do reunite in ASOIAF, it\u2019s going to take more than a hug and some conversation for these early childhood wounds to heal. It\u2019s going to take mutual dialogue and it\u2019s going to take time. We know that at this point in ASOIAF, Sansa has evolved to a point where she understands why her earlier behaviors were wrong, and where she is praying for home as well, but that won\u2019t be enough to make up for the early hurt and loneliness she caused Arya. Arya also reacted in kind, no doubt about that, but for them to reach a mutual level of love, trust, and respect will require that Sansa acknowledges why her earlier behaviors were wrong.\u00a0</li><li>Arya makes many friends and many allies, and does not espouse cliquey, exclusive, or xenophobic behavior. She hates the Lannisters, and she hates their\u00a0\u201ceveryone but us is an enemy\u201d mentality. She is one of the first people early on in A Game of Thrones who identified that the Lannisters are rotten to their core.\u00a0</li><li>Arya has a very strong and close relationship with Gendry, and clearly has feelings for him.\u00a0</li><li>George R. R. Martin stated that there are five key characters: Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Bran Stark, Arya Stark, and Tyrion Lannister.\u00a0</li><li>Across all five currently released books, Arya has 33 viewpoint chapters while Sansa has 24 viewpoint chapters.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Let\u2019s look at what the show has done to Arya in comparison:</p><ul><li>Minimized the importance of Jon and Arya\u2019s relationship and given more emotionally significant scenes to Jon and Sansa</li><li>Gave Sansa more importance/more scenes than Arya\u00a0</li><li>Didn\u2019t show Jon reacting particularly emotionally in season 7 to the letter bearing news that Bran and Arya have returned to Winterfell\u00a0</li><li>Made Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion partially about Sansa\u00a0</li><li>Showed Sansa ruling by Jon\u2019s side in Winterfell, and not any scene of Arya specifically ruling by his side\u00a0</li><li>Gave\u00a0\u201cthe lone wolf dies but the pack survives\u201d line to Sansa\u00a0</li><li>Turned Arya from a curious, inquisitive, kind girl into a sullen, introverted, emotionless assassin who is only good for killing the enemies we want to see killed\u00a0</li><li>Arya exterminates House Frey \u2013&gt; Jon gets total credit for avenging the Red Wedding\u00a0</li><li>Arya executes Petyr Baelish \u2013&gt; Sansa gets credit for\u00a0\u201ccoming up with the scheme\u201d, even though we know that Petyr was actually manipulating her to the point that Sansa did believe Arya was going to kill her until Bran had to tell her the truth, and without Bran\u2019s powers, no one would\u2019ve known the truth about Petyr\u00a0</li><li>Arya kills the Night King \u2013&gt; is not even present in the victory feast that\u2019s held in her honor</li><li>Prompted people to desire for Arya to kill Cersei and, later, Daenerys\u00a0</li><li>Places an exaggerated emphasis on Arya\u2019s list which prompts fans and certain male cast members to call her a psychopath\u00a0</li><li>Arya spent seven seasons trying to get back home to Winterfell, only to end up leaving Westeros to sail West and possibly discover new lands, in spite of the fact that without her, Winterfell would have been overrun by the NK and his army\u00a0</li><li>Turned Arya from someone who cares about people, especially other women, who likes having friends, who is open-minded, and who looks up to warrior women, into a xenophobe who apparently only serves as Sansa\u2019s mouthpiece. Puts Sansa on a pedestal at Arya\u2019s expense.\u00a0</li><li>Makes her say that she doesn\u2019t need allies\u00a0</li><li>Makes Sandor give her a lecture on the importance of choosing life and the pitfalls of vengeance even though they later show Sandor dying the same way he was traumatized after killing the brother who traumatized him\u00a0</li><li>Makes her randomly dislike Daenerys and claim that \u201cshe\u2019ll never know her because she\u2019s not one of them\u201d, even though Dany is the woman Jon loves and has bent the knee to, a warrior queen with dragons, and is the woman who helped her family retake Winterfell and even though there is no scene of them speaking prior to that\u00a0</li><li>Shows some scenes of her caring for civilians in 8x05, but other than that, doesn\u2019t showcase the side of her that craves friends and makes friends with people regardless of status throughout s7 and s8\u00a0</li><li>Makes her tell Jon that Sansa is the smartest person she knows, even though they\u2019ve only been reunited for a short while, and even though she hasn\u2019t actually been shown any good examples of Sansa being the smartest person she knows, and even though Arya herself is quite intelligent. Essentially, Arya\u2019s intelligence is minimized to prop Sansa up as the character we should all be listening to. Also, Arya respects Jon a lot, and would never talk to him as if he\u2019s disrespecting their family, especially not for the sake of Sansa.\u00a0</li><li>Made Sansa tell Arya that she still thinks of her as a strange and weird person, which is not actually cute or funny, because in the books, Sansa does think of her as a strange and weird person, and it\u2019s not construed in a positive light at all. It is, in fact, at the heart of Arya\u2019s loneliness at King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0</li><li>The entire confrontation between Sansa and Arya in 7x06 is absolutely disgusting, as is the Sansa v. Arya subplot, which this scene really encapsulates\u00a0</li><li>Demonizing Arya for the sake of making Sansa seem more intelligent</li><li>Sansa taking all the credit for retaking Wintefell, disparaging Jon in the process (which we know that Arya would never let her do, but in this scene Arya lets her say it)\u00a0</li><li>Randomly making Arya blame Sansa for what happened to Ned even though Arya would never do that\u00a0</li><li>Trivializing and minimizing Arya\u2019s trauma by having Sansa say that Arya doesn\u2019t understand what she went through and that Arya would never have survived what Sansa experienced\u00a0</li><li>Ruining Arya\u2019s relationship with Gendry\u00a0</li><li>She genuinely does love him\u00a0</li><li>She wouldn\u2019t just break his heart like that\u00a0</li><li>They didn\u2019t even show them speaking once in 8x06</li><li>Having Arya hate on Daenerys and even Yara just for the sake of the Starks, which Arya in the books would never do\u00a0</li><li>Not even entertaining the notion that perhaps Arya could be at Winterfell to, by Sansa\u2019s side, or she could be at Jon\u2019s side north of the wall, or even Bran\u2019s side at King\u2019s Landing. Instead, completely isolating her from her family once again, making her journey circular.\u00a0</li></ul><p>This serves an important purpose of the message D&amp;D are sending. They are essentially stating that a woman like Arya, who interacts with people regardless of occupation or status in a feudal era, and who is intelligent and actively questions and defies compulsory femininity and the gendered norms of her time, is not fit for family, or for home, or for love, or for leadership. She is good enough to be an emotionless robot that kills her enemies in empowering moments, but she is not good enough for retaking or ruling Winterfell, or to stay by her family\u2019s side, or to find happiness with the man she loves. Yes, she will never be a\u00a0\u201clady\u201d in the conventional sense of the word. But if D&amp;D had shown Arya ruling the Stormlands with Gendry by her side, they could\u2019ve actually subverted expectations in a positive manner. They could\u2019ve shown that a woman who is not conventionally feminine can still be both a strong leader and someone with a husband and a family. Just as they didn\u2019t really change the feudal system, though, they of course wouldn\u2019t show such a takedown of Westerosi patriarchy. The woman who gets to Rule the North is not only the older sister of the King, making her status gained through oligarchic nepotism; it is also the woman who is conventionally beautiful, who has always wanted to be a Queen/a Lady, who embraces femininity instead of questioning it, and who has not been shown to befriend or engage with smallfolk and low-born people.\u00a0</p><p>This message is extremely deliberate. They demonized Arya in season 7 to make Sansa seem smarter and yet to prompt fans to view Sansa as someone who still can do no wrong and who\u2019s just treated so meany even by her own sister, and gosh we have to defend her and protect her because she\u2019s so precious and pure and soft and sensitive and fragile BUT she\u2019s also strong and empowered and cleverer than Arya and Arya could NEVER survive what Sansa went through. It\u2019s no wonder that so many fans of Sansa despised Arya in s7. Yet those same fans only began loving Arya again when Arya executed Sansa\u2019s enemy, Petyr, and later when she became Arya\u2019s mouthpiece in s8. I even saw some people, when the Winterfell Crypts promo for s8 came out, that Arya and Jon are like guards that are defending their queen Sansa. This exploitation of Arya\u2019s character to treat her as a prop for Sansa\u2019s sake, and then claiming that this is a celebration of empowering sisterly love, is directly the result of the theme D&amp;D have embodied, which is that a\u00a0\u201cgood\u201d woman, a\u00a0\u201cfeminist\u201d woman, a woman who is meant to be a leader, is feminine, and that women who are not feminine are anti-woman, who are not capable of experiencing or surviving trauma (and in this case trauma is a code for sexualized violence against women), and that they are not deserving of love or male desire because they just wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u00a0</p><p>On the question of sexual violence or abuse: D&amp;D have Sansa state that Arya wouldn\u2019t survive what she went through because it is a norm in our society that only feminine women experience sexual violence or abuse, and that more gender non-conforming women are somehow incapable of experiencing or surviving sexual violence. It goes back to the notion that rape and assault only happen to pretty, conventionally attractive white women, which is a myth that white supremacist patriarchy has created and maintained. Arya has gone through a lot, just as much as Sansa and the other Starklings have, and to have two women argue about who could survive trauma is disgusting, especially by ending it saying that the gnc woman couldn\u2019t possibly understand what the feminine woman went through.</p><p>We already know that it is still expected of women, in this day and age, to be feminine. We already know that gender non-conforming women are looked down upon, and that the misogyny they experience is treated as non-existent or not as important, and that they are seen as having\u00a0\u201cprivilege\u201d over feminine women, even though they actually suffer unique marginalization as a result of being gender non-conforming. Yet D&amp;D have the interest of upholding patriarchal dictates, which is why they went for the ending they did with Arya. They are teaching people a lesson here: if you\u2019re a girl who defies femininity and makes friends with all sorts of diverse people regardless of class or birth status, you\u2019re not a good or pure ideal woman and you\u2019re never going to find the love that you want, and instead you will be isolated and only be good enough for doing the dirty work for other people. Arya is not allowed to rule, or to be with her siblings, or to marry Gendry, because she is positioned as an\u00a0\u201canti-femininity\u201d subject; and women who dare to defy or question femininity are punished, both by fictional narratives and by dominant patriarchal culture. It isn\u2019t even just that D&amp;D love Sansa; it\u2019s that they actively want to uphold the message that women like Arya are\u00a0\u201cstrange and weird creatures\u201d who need to be shipped away from us, lest they bring ruin upon our patriarchal society.\u00a0</p></p>",

The woman who gets to Rule the North is not only the older sister of the King, making her status gained through oligarchic nepotism; it is also the woman who is conventionally beautiful, who has always wanted to be a Queen/a Lady, who embraces femininity instead of questioning it, and who has not been shown to befriend or engage with smallfolk and low-born people.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is extremely deliberate. They demonized Arya in season 7 to make Sansa seem smarter and yet to prompt fans to view Sansa as someone who still can do no wrong and who&rsquo;s just treated so meany even by her own sister, and gosh we have to defend her and protect her because she&rsquo;s so precious and pure and soft and sensitive and fragile BUT she&rsquo;s also strong and empowered and cleverer than Arya and Arya could NEVER survive what Sansa went through. It&rsquo;s no wonder that so many fans of Sansa despised Arya in s7. Yet those same fans only began loving Arya again when Arya executed Sansa&rsquo;s enemy, Petyr, and later when she became Arya&rsquo;s mouthpiece in s8. I even saw some people, when the Winterfell Crypts promo for s8 came out, that Arya and Jon are like guards that are defending their queen Sansa. This exploitation of Arya&rsquo;s character to treat her as a prop for Sansa&rsquo;s sake, and then claiming that this is a celebration of empowering sisterly love, is directly the result of the theme D&amp;D have embodied, which is that a&nbsp;&ldquo;good&rdquo; woman, a&nbsp;&ldquo;feminist&rdquo; woman, a woman who is meant to be a leader, is feminine, and that women who are not feminine are anti-woman, who are not capable of experiencing or surviving trauma (and in this case trauma is a code for sexualized violence against women), and that they are not deserving of love or male desire because they just wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with it.&nbsp;</p><p>On the question of sexual violence or abuse: D&amp;D have Sansa state that Arya wouldn&rsquo;t survive what she went through because it is a norm in our society that only feminine women experience sexual violence or abuse, and that more gender non-conforming women are somehow incapable of experiencing or surviving sexual violence. It goes back to the notion that rape and assault only happen to pretty, conventionally attractive white women, which is a myth that white supremacist patriarchy has created and maintained. Arya has gone through a lot, just as much as Sansa and the other Starklings have, and to have two women argue about who could survive trauma is disgusting, especially by ending it saying that the gnc woman couldn&rsquo;t possibly understand what the feminine woman went through.</p><p>We already know that it is still expected of women, in this day and age, to be feminine. We already know that gender non-conforming women are looked down upon, and that the misogyny they experience is treated as non-existent or not as important, and that they are seen as having&nbsp;&ldquo;privilege&rdquo; over feminine women, even though they actually suffer unique marginalization as a result of being gender non-conforming. Yet D&amp;D have the interest of upholding patriarchal dictates, which is why they went for the ending they did with Arya. They are teaching people a lesson here: if you&rsquo;re a girl who defies femininity and makes friends with all sorts of diverse people regardless of class or birth status, you&rsquo;re not a good or pure ideal woman and you&rsquo;re never going to find the love that you want, and instead you will be isolated and only be good enough for doing the dirty work for other people. Arya is not allowed to rule, or to be with her siblings, or to marry Gendry, because she is positioned as an&nbsp;&ldquo;anti-femininity&rdquo; subject; and women who dare to defy or question femininity are punished, both by fictional narratives and by dominant patriarchal culture. It isn&rsquo;t even just that D&amp;D love Sansa; it&rsquo;s that they actively want to uphold the message that women like Arya are&nbsp;&ldquo;strange and weird creatures&rdquo; who need to be shipped away from us, lest they bring ruin upon our patriarchal society.&nbsp;</p></p>",
