Then it kept going, I got near the end, and then finished up with that cliffhanger and a part two planned.\u00a0<br/>I hope you like it! The first thing I saw from you was you spite-writing WinterIron against that one anon, and then I saw you liked the assumed death trope so&hellip;.this came from that. &lt;3\u00a0<br/><br/>~~~</p><p>Tony was the flashy target.</p><p>He was the one who spun through the air, who taunted the villains, who always got hit but got back up. </p><p>Bucky was his shadow. </p><p>The steady hand behind the scope, the one who made impossible shots, the one who was never seen. </p><p>When you thought <i>target </i>you thought Tony. No one could ever find Bucky, so he wasn\u2019t a target.</p><p>Usually.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Tuesdays were cursed days. </p><p>True, his parents died on a Monday, but he\u2019d been informed on Tuesday. He\u2019d met Ty on a Tuesday, he\u2019d found out about Sunset on Tuesday. He\u2019d woken up in Afghanistan on Tuesday. </p><p>Tuesdays were cursed, and that was just the way the universe worked. </p><p>Bucky died on a Tuesday. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Tony wasn\u2019t there, was on a business meeting in Beijing. </p><p><strike>He should have been there.</strike></p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS said through his phone, interrupting a meeting. JARVIS never interrupted something like this unless it was life or death. (Later, he\u2019d think back on the irony of that thought.) \u201cThere has been an emergency.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Pepper said with a deep frown. \u201cI\u2019ll cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate if you could come along Miss Potts.\u201d JARVIS said cautiously and they both froze and looked at each other. Tony stood, apologizing to the group in Cantonese and explaining there was a personal emergency within the family. Thankfully, they seemed to pick up on the grave tones and agreed. </p><p>JARVIS only directed them to the plane, where the crew was speeding to get it ready before schedule. The door sealed shut, ensuring that no one could listen in. </p><p>\u201cSpill.\u201d Tony demanded, sitting down with Pepper beside him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Master Barnes,\u201d JARVIS said quietly. Sympathetically. \u201cHe is\u2026\u201d A pause. JARVIS never paused. \u201cDead.\u201d </p><p>He could barely feel Peppers fingers winding through his, squeezing tightly. Her voice was strangely muffled, even when she was sitting right beside him. The suit was there, folded awkwardly in front of him, controlled by JARVIS. </p><p>\u201cSir, can you tell me what 76 times 8263 is?\u201d JARVIS said, his voice steady. </p><p>\u201c627,988.\u201d Tony said, stuttering over the numbers. </p><p>\u201cThat number divided by 8?\u201d JARVIS continued. </p><p>What was the number again? </p><p>\u201c627, 988 divided by 8.\u201d JARVIS prompted. </p><p>\u201c78498 point 5.\u201d Tony said, feeling the numbers slot into place. Numbers were good, the numbers never lied. He blinked and looked up. </p><p>He didn\u2019t bother with denial. JARVIS never lied either. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead.\u201d JARVIS said first. </p><p>Not good enough. </p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cTones,\u201d Rhodey said. He was waiting, of course he was. He didn\u2019t look at him with pity, like he was afraid Tony would shatter. </p><p>Or snap. </p><p>He just reached out, JARVIS already pulling the armour off him without a command and Tony would scold him, but Rhodey was there, dragging him into a hug. Every time, he\u2019s fourteen again, Rhodey\u2019s arms always solid and unshaking as he hugs. Tony reached up, tangled his fingers in Rhodey\u2019s polo shirt, because Rhodey\u2019s fashion sense was Like That. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened.\u201d A demand, not a request. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Rhodey said, and Tony would draw back but Rhodey wouldn\u2019t let him go. \u201cBut they knew he was coming. The entire base was a trap.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming back.\u201d </p><p>~~~</p><p>He stared down at the whiskey, swirling it around in the glass. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not here to stop me.\u201d Tony said, watching the condensation. He stared at it until his eyes blurred and he fell asleep out of sheer tiredness. </p><p>It was a sick type of routine, pouring out a glass, but unable to take it, unable to forget because even if he was <i>dead </i>Bucky\u2019s memory didn\u2019t deserve this. </p><p>The bots were the only ones allowed in the workshop at first. DUM-E took away the glass every time, and U followed him with the broom for when he inevitably smashed it. Butterfingers tried to clumsily draw a card to cheer him up, and JARVIS always kept piano music playing in the background. </p><p>~~~</p><p>Rhodey showed up with shitty sci-fi movies, Happy brought apple juice and shot glasses, and Pepper gave everyone her ridiculously amazing hand massages. </p><p>~~~</p><p>Tony kept working, and didn\u2019t talk as much.</p><p>He wore sunglasses everywhere.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Tuesday \u00a0was also the day he learned Bucky wasn\u2019t dead after all. </p><p>~~~</p><p>He was staring at another glass of whiskey. He was not drunk, but he wasn\u2019t working and his mind was <i>loud</i>. </p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS said, interrupting him, \u201cMaster Barnes is not dead.\u201d </p><p>A beat of silence, a rush of hope that Tony ruthlessly quashed. </p><p>\u201cSuit.\u201d he rasped. JARVIS would never lie to him, so Tony skipped past denial straight into <i>relief</i>. \u201cGet me Mark 40. How? I thought they were all dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a tunnel, built into an old sewer system. They blew that up too when they fled, so even when we excavated the whole place, it looked like more rubble.\u201d JARVIS said, wrapping the Mark 40 around him. It wasn\u2019t his most powerful armour, but he could move fast. And hit hard. If he thought about it too hard, Iron Man just helped Tony take the power of something like the Jericho Missile, and compact it into something shorter than his forearm.</p><p>\u201cThe people involved?\u201d Tony said, performing a quick check of the weapons. He wasn\u2019t as loaded as War Machine, but what he did have&hellip;<i>hurt</i>. </p><p>And hurt them he would. </p><p>By the time he\u2019d finished suiting up, his relief had turned into <i>anger</i>. </p><p>\u201cI have a location,\u201d JARVIS said, \u201cColonel Rhodes is calling, shall I con-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlock.\u201d Tony ordered. He couldn\u2019t talk to Rhodey. Rhodey would make him wait, to delay him until Rhodey caught up. \u201cTime to test out the new feature.\u201d </p><p>The Shotgun armour was built to go up to speeds of Mach 5, but he hadn\u2019t fully tested it yet. JARVIS\u2019 pointed silence was horribly judgmental, but Tony stared at the little red dot on the map in the corner and said nothing. </p><p>He was going to get his boyfriend back, and blow everyone there into smithereens.

JARVIS never interrupted something like this unless it was life or death. (Later, he\u2019d think back on the irony of that thought.) \u201cThere has been an emergency.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Pepper said with a deep frown. \u201cI\u2019ll cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate if you could come along Miss Potts.\u201d JARVIS said cautiously and they both froze and looked at each other. Tony stood, apologizing to the group in Cantonese and explaining there was a personal emergency within the family. Thankfully, they seemed to pick up on the grave tones and agreed. </p><p>JARVIS only directed them to the plane, where the crew was speeding to get it ready before schedule. The door sealed shut, ensuring that no one could listen in. </p><p>\u201cSpill.\u201d Tony demanded, sitting down with Pepper beside him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Master Barnes,\u201d JARVIS said quietly. Sympathetically. \u201cHe is\u2026\u201d A pause. JARVIS never paused. \u201cDead.\u201d </p><p>He could barely feel Peppers fingers winding through his, squeezing tightly. Her voice was strangely muffled, even when she was sitting right beside him. The suit was there, folded awkwardly in front of him, controlled by JARVIS. </p><p>\u201cSir, can you tell me what 76 times 8263 is?\u201d JARVIS said, his voice steady. </p><p>\u201c627,988.\u201d Tony said, stuttering over the numbers. </p><p>\u201cThat number divided by 8?\u201d JARVIS continued. </p><p>What was the number again? </p><p>\u201c627, 988 divided by 8.\u201d JARVIS prompted. </p><p>\u201c78498 point 5.\u201d Tony said, feeling the numbers slot into place. Numbers were good, the numbers never lied. He blinked and looked up. </p><p>He didn\u2019t bother with denial. JARVIS never lied either. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead.\u201d JARVIS said first. </p><p>Not good enough. </p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cTones,\u201d Rhodey said. He was waiting, of course he was. He didn\u2019t look at him with pity, like he was afraid Tony would shatter. </p><p>Or snap. </p><p>He just reached out, JARVIS already pulling the armour off him without a command and Tony would scold him, but Rhodey was there, dragging him into a hug. Every time, he\u2019s fourteen again, Rhodey\u2019s arms always solid and unshaking as he hugs. Tony reached up, tangled his fingers in Rhodey\u2019s polo shirt, because Rhodey\u2019s fashion sense was Like That. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened.\u201d A demand, not a request. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Rhodey said, and Tony would draw back but Rhodey wouldn\u2019t let him go. \u201cBut they knew he was coming. The entire base was a trap.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming back.\u201d </p><p>~~~</p><p>He stared down at the whiskey, swirling it around in the glass. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not here to stop me.\u201d Tony said, watching the condensation. He stared at it until his eyes blurred and he fell asleep out of sheer tiredness. </p><p>It was a sick type of routine, pouring out a glass, but unable to take it, unable to forget because even if he was <i>dead </i>Bucky\u2019s memory didn\u2019t deserve this. </p><p>The bots were the only ones allowed in the workshop at first. DUM-E took away the glass every time, and U followed him with the broom for when he inevitably smashed it. Butterfingers tried to clumsily draw a card to cheer him up, and JARVIS always kept piano music playing in the background. </p><p>~~~</p><p>Rhodey showed up with shitty sci-fi movies, Happy brought apple juice and shot glasses, and Pepper gave everyone her ridiculously amazing hand massages. </p><p>~~~</p><p>Tony kept working, and didn\u2019t talk as much.</p><p>He wore sunglasses everywhere.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Tuesday \u00a0was also the day he learned Bucky wasn\u2019t dead after all. </p><p>~~~</p><p>He was staring at another glass of whiskey. He was not drunk, but he wasn\u2019t working and his mind was <i>loud</i>. </p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS said, interrupting him, \u201cMaster Barnes is not dead.\u201d </p><p>A beat of silence, a rush of hope that Tony ruthlessly quashed. </p><p>\u201cSuit.\u201d he rasped. JARVIS would never lie to him, so Tony skipped past denial straight into <i>relief</i>. \u201cGet me Mark 40. How? I thought they were all dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a tunnel, built into an old sewer system. They blew that up too when they fled, so even when we excavated the whole place, it looked like more rubble.\u201d JARVIS said, wrapping the Mark 40 around him. It wasn\u2019t his most powerful armour, but he could move fast. And hit hard. If he thought about it too hard, Iron Man just helped Tony take the power of something like the Jericho Missile, and compact it into something shorter than his forearm.</p><p>\u201cThe people involved?\u201d Tony said, performing a quick check of the weapons. He wasn\u2019t as loaded as War Machine, but what he did have\u2026<i>hurt</i>. </p><p>And hurt them he would. </p><p>By the time he\u2019d finished suiting up, his relief had turned into <i>anger</i>. </p><p>\u201cI have a location,\u201d JARVIS said, \u201cColonel Rhodes is calling, shall I con-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlock.\u201d Tony ordered. He couldn\u2019t talk to Rhodey. Rhodey would make him wait, to delay him until Rhodey caught up. \u201cTime to test out the new feature.\u201d </p><p>The Shotgun armour was built to go up to speeds of Mach 5, but he hadn\u2019t fully tested it yet. JARVIS\u2019 pointed silence was horribly judgmental, but Tony stared at the little red dot on the map in the corner and said nothing. </p><p>He was going to get his boyfriend back, and blow everyone there into smithereens. No tunnel was going to save them from that. </p><p>JARVIS\u2019 disapproving silence grew as he blocked all the calls and messages, the world hurtling past at 1700m/s. The base came into view, sitting in the middle of Siberia.

Her voice was strangely muffled, even when she was sitting right beside him. The suit was there, folded awkwardly in front of him, controlled by JARVIS. </p><p>\u201cSir, can you tell me what 76 times 8263 is?\u201d JARVIS said, his voice steady. </p><p>\u201c627,988.\u201d Tony said, stuttering over the numbers. </p><p>\u201cThat number divided by 8?\u201d JARVIS continued. </p><p>What was the number again? </p><p>\u201c627, 988 divided by 8.\u201d JARVIS prompted. </p><p>\u201c78498 point 5.\u201d Tony said, feeling the numbers slot into place. Numbers were good, the numbers never lied. He blinked and looked up. </p><p>He didn\u2019t bother with denial. JARVIS never lied either. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead.\u201d JARVIS said first. </p><p>Not good enough. </p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cTones,\u201d Rhodey said. He was waiting, of course he was. He didn\u2019t look at him with pity, like he was afraid Tony would shatter. </p><p>Or snap. </p><p>He just reached out, JARVIS already pulling the armour off him without a command and Tony would scold him, but Rhodey was there, dragging him into a hug. Every time, he\u2019s fourteen again, Rhodey\u2019s arms always solid and unshaking as he hugs. Tony reached up, tangled his fingers in Rhodey\u2019s polo shirt, because Rhodey\u2019s fashion sense was Like That. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened.\u201d A demand, not a request. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Rhodey said, and Tony would draw back but Rhodey wouldn\u2019t let him go. \u201cBut they knew he was coming. The entire base was a trap.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming back.\u201d </p><p>~~~</p><p>He stared down at the whiskey, swirling it around in the glass. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not here to stop me.\u201d Tony said, watching the condensation. He stared at it until his eyes blurred and he fell asleep out of sheer tiredness. </p><p>It was a sick type of routine, pouring out a glass, but unable to take it, unable to forget because even if he was <i>dead </i>Bucky\u2019s memory didn\u2019t deserve this. </p><p>The bots were the only ones allowed in the workshop at first.

He was not drunk, but he wasn\u2019t working and his mind was <i>loud</i>. </p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS said, interrupting him, \u201cMaster Barnes is not dead.\u201d </p><p>A beat of silence, a rush of hope that Tony ruthlessly quashed. </p><p>\u201cSuit.\u201d he rasped. JARVIS would never lie to him, so Tony skipped past denial straight into <i>relief</i>. \u201cGet me Mark 40. How? I thought they were all dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a tunnel, built into an old sewer system. They blew that up too when they fled, so even when we excavated the whole place, it looked like more rubble.\u201d JARVIS said, wrapping the Mark 40 around him. It wasn\u2019t his most powerful armour, but he could move fast. And hit hard. If he thought about it too hard, Iron Man just helped Tony take the power of something like the Jericho Missile, and compact it into something shorter than his forearm.</p><p>\u201cThe people involved?\u201d Tony said, performing a quick check of the weapons. He wasn\u2019t as loaded as War Machine, but what he did have\u2026<i>hurt</i>. </p><p>And hurt them he would. </p><p>By the time he\u2019d finished suiting up, his relief had turned into <i>anger</i>. </p><p>\u201cI have a location,\u201d JARVIS said, \u201cColonel Rhodes is calling, shall I con-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlock.\u201d Tony ordered. He couldn\u2019t talk to Rhodey. Rhodey would make him wait, to delay him until Rhodey caught up. \u201cTime to test out the new feature.\u201d </p><p>The Shotgun armour was built to go up to speeds of Mach 5, but he hadn\u2019t fully tested it yet. JARVIS\u2019 pointed silence was horribly judgmental, but Tony stared at the little red dot on the map in the corner and said nothing. </p><p>He was going to get his boyfriend back, and blow everyone there into smithereens. No tunnel was going to save them from that. </p><p>JARVIS\u2019 disapproving silence grew as he blocked all the calls and messages, the world hurtling past at 1700m/s. The base came into view, sitting in the middle of Siberia. Considering JARVIS didn\u2019t have an inkling of its existence until however he\u2019d gotten coordinates 20 minutes ago, they wanted to keep Bucky hidden. </p><p>They would burn for that. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cEngage retroreflectors.\u201d he murmured. The armours surface shimmered and then the armour vanished from sight. Harley\u2019s suggestion for a \u2018stealth suit\u2019 was the only way he\u2019d get into that facility without being found out and he was never so thankful for that. </p><p>\u201cSir, Colonel Rhodes is asking for you to wait.\u201d JARVIS said neutrally. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Tony said, letting himself freefall into a steep dive. \u201cThey could be doing anything to him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSergeant Barnes would want you to be safe.\u201d JARVIS said. \u201cIf you get injured trying to get to him, it would hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the faith J,\u201d Tony said, blinking away tears. He was <i>so close.</i> \u201cI\u2019m not going to get hurt, you\u2019ve got my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs always.\u201d JARVIS said, part statement, part promise. He brought up the scans for Tony without further comment, highlighting the best route inside.</p><p>JARVIS was the best. </p><p>Tony inched in through a propped open door, the only sound the faint whirring from the machinery. </p><p>There was no one in the hallway, the base was practically ancient since there was no technology he could hack. His unease grew as he kept going through the back of the base. They were all gathered nearer to the front, facing the only spot the Quinjet could land, but there had to be someone right?</p><p>\u201cOne heat signature found.\u201d JARVIS said quietly, placing it on the map. \u201cThe rooms beyond are lined, I cannot figure out if there is anyone inside. The imaging around shows that they are cooler than most, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold enough to house a cyrotube?\u201d Tony asked rhetorically. He flew down the hallway the other side, just in case of a trap, but there was no one there. He flicked off the retroreflectors, and then kicked the door in full force. </p><p>There was a man standing there, holding a bloody scalpel like he was auditioning for a horror movie. Tony didn\u2019t give him a chance to speak, flying straight into him and wrapping the metal fingers of the armour around his throat. </p><p>\u201cTell me where he is.\u201d Tony said. He didn\u2019t ask, he demanded. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do whatever you want.\u201d he gasped, scrabbling at the arms of the armour. \u201cI\u2019m never going to tell you.\u201d </p><p>Truth. There was nothing but triumph and confidence in his gaze. He could give him to Natasha, she\u2019d eventually get it out of him, she always did. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t have <i>time</i>. </p><p>Soon enough someone would see the broken door, and since this level was deeper, he\u2019d have to fight his way through all of them solo to get Bucky out. </p><p>Tony twisted his head, breaking the spine with brute force and letting the body drop to the floor. </p><p>\u201cJARVIS, remaining rooms.\u201d he ordered, spinning and heading for the first one. The lock melted open but there was simply a room with medical equipment. </p><p>Some of the blood was fresh. </p><p>JARVIS kept scanning, pulling up all the readings as Tony started systematically clearing the other rooms. </p><p>The last one, with a red marking on it, revealed Bucky lying strapped to some sort of table. </p><p>His breath caught, knees nearly buckling in relief. </p><p>He hadn\u2019t let himself <i>hope </i>until now, hadn\u2019t dared to believe. </p><p>\u201cCome on sweet cheeks, let me see those pretty blue eyes.\u201d Tony said shooting forward and ripping him free of the straps. </p><p>\u201cSergeant. 32557\u2026\u201d Bucky\u2019s eyes cracked open slightly, staring at Tony blearily. \u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah it\u2019s me.\u201d Tony said, swallowing hard at the lump in his throat. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not real.\u201d Bucky said, eyes sliding closed again and making no move to get up. \u201cYou\u2019re not real, you\u2019re not real, <i>you\u2019renotreal</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real,\u201d Tony said, glancing quickly at the scans. No one around, and the others had arrived and were engaging with the other hostiles. He pulled the armour away, grasping Bucky\u2019s hands, metal and flesh. He pressed Bucky\u2019s metal fingers onto the reactor. \u201cFeel the vibrations? It\u2019s me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Bucky said, letting Tony press his fingers to the reactor as Tony breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p>Then his fingers abruptly tightened on the reactor, gripping the casing tightly.</p><p>Tony lurched away in panic, the armour starting to close around him, but Bucky\u2019s fingers around his upper arm didn\u2019t let him go far. </p><p>With a light <i>click </i>the reactor separated from his chest. </p><p>Tony collapsed. </p><p>This suit still ran on his arc reactor energy, not its own. </p><p>And now it had nothing. </p><p>The reactor dangled from Bucky\u2019s fingers. He leaned down, and Tony saw the real reason he hadn\u2019t opened his eyes the entire time. </p><p>There was nothing left of his boyfriend in those eyes. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hail HYDRA.</i>\u201d </p><p>~~~</p><p>Tuesday was the day he wished Bucky was dead. </p></p>",
