It was getting late and he was beyond exhausted from the fight. He was supposed to go back to the compound for a check-up and to give a report on how his part of the mission went but he so badly wanted to get home to MJ. He hadn\u2019t seen her all day since he had to leave early and he couldn\u2019t wait to lay in her arms tonight. When he got to his door it was locked which was strange because MJ never locked it unless she knew he wasn\u2019t coming home and he had reminded her that he was. </p><p>He took out his keys and unlocked it. Quietly stepping in and dropping his keys into the bowl by the door. He slipped his shoes off and hung his jacket on the hook. As he started walking down the hallway he heard noises coming from their bedroom. He figured she just fell asleep with the TVs on, again. </p><p>He opened the door and to his horror he saw MJ on top of Flash, they both were completely naked. MJ turned around to the sound of the door opened and when she saw Peter standing there she jumped off of Flash and grabbed the sheet to cover herself. Peter felt like he couldn\u2019t breath.</p><p>\u201cPete, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be home so soon.\u201d Flash said looking shocked and worried about what was about to come. Peter stood there for a moment trying to truly process what he just saw. His girlfriend of two years was just fucking the guy that had bullied Peter all through high school. He moved over from in front of the door and pointed.</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d Peter said holding back tears.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very good manners.\u201d Flash joked as he stayed sitting.</p><p>\u201cFlash I said get out before I make you.\u201d Peter said flatly to him. He had tears welling up in his eyes and he really didn\u2019t want him to see him like this. Flash stood up and grabbed his clothes. He quickly got dressed and left. Once Peter heard the door close he walked over to the bed and sat with his back to MJ.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for you to know about this.\u201d MJ said as she crawled across the bed and put her hands onto his shoulders. He rolled his shoulders to get her hands off of him and he just sighed. </p><p>\u201cI would hope you didn\u2019t want me to see that.\u201d He said. No joking in his voice, no sweetness like he usually spoke with around MJ. All that came from his tone was hurt, and emptiness. Brokenness. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. It\u2019s just I haven\u2019t been able to see you as much lately and I needed something-\u201c She said quietly trying not to set anything off. With those words he jumped up and scoffed at her.</p><p>\u201cSo this is my fault? I try so hard to make time for you, but this is my fault? You\u2019re the only thing keeping me happy right now. You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m glad to come home from missions. The reason I skip rundowns and check-ups.\u201d His voice cracked as he talked and he couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore. He fell to the ground and started crying. </p><p>MJ tried to comfort him but he just moved away from her and tried to steady is breathing. Once he had it under control he faced back to her. His face was puffy and his lip was still trembling lie it always did when he was holding back tears. It made MJ hate herself how she could do this to him. She went to say something but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201c<b>You said forever</b>, Michelle. You told me that we were forever and I believed you.\u201d He looked into her eyes and she saw all the hurt he was feeling. </p><p>\u201cI meant it. I meant it every time I said it. I just can\u2019t be alone like this anymore.\u201d She spoke truthfully. He sat there thinking over what she had said.</p><p>\u201cMeant&hellip;\u201d he whispered to himself but she heard him say it.</p><p>\u201cI think you should leave tomorrow. You can stay here tonight but tomorrow I want you to leave. You can take the bed and I\u2019ll go stay with Tony tonight.\u201d\u201d Peter stood up and left the room. He left MJ sitting on the floor with nothing but a sheet covering her. As Peter walked through the door with tears running down his face something clicked. </p><p>Peter sat up in his bed breathing heavy. MJ was holding his hand staring at him with wide eyes and her was a mess meaning she had just woken up.</p><p>\u201cYou had a bad dream, love.\u201d MJ soothed him by rubbing circles on his hand. She helped him steady his breathing and she moved her hand to his back to try to calm him better. He looked att her and kissed her passionately. She eased into it and started kissing him back. Once he pulled away he just stared into his eyes for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIt was a terrible, terrible dream.\u201d He said laying back down. MJ laid down with him and got herself comfortable snuggled against him.</p><p>\u201cHow about you tell me all about it tomorrow, love. Tonight lets just go to sleep and have nice dreams.\u201d She smiled up at him and ran her fingers lightly through his hair.</p>",

No joking in his voice, no sweetness like he usually spoke with around MJ. All that came from his tone was hurt, and emptiness. Brokenness. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. It\u2019s just I haven\u2019t been able to see you as much lately and I needed something-\u201c She said quietly trying not to set anything off. With those words he jumped up and scoffed at her.</p><p>\u201cSo this is my fault? I try so hard to make time for you, but this is my fault? You\u2019re the only thing keeping me happy right now. You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m glad to come home from missions. The reason I skip rundowns and check-ups.\u201d His voice cracked as he talked and he couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore. He fell to the ground and started crying. </p><p>MJ tried to comfort him but he just moved away from her and tried to steady is breathing. Once he had it under control he faced back to her. His face was puffy and his lip was still trembling lie it always did when he was holding back tears. It made MJ hate herself how she could do this to him. She went to say something but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201c<b>You said forever</b>, Michelle. You told me that we were forever and I believed you.\u201d He looked into her eyes and she saw all the hurt he was feeling. </p><p>\u201cI meant it. I meant it every time I said it. I just can\u2019t be alone like this anymore.\u201d She spoke truthfully. He sat there thinking over what she had said.</p><p>\u201cMeant\u2026\u201d he whispered to himself but she heard him say it.</p><p>\u201cI think you should leave tomorrow. You can stay here tonight but tomorrow I want you to leave. You can take the bed and I\u2019ll go stay with Tony tonight.\u201d\u201d Peter stood up and left the room. He left MJ sitting on the floor with nothing but a sheet covering her. As Peter walked through the door with tears running down his face something clicked. </p><p>Peter sat up in his bed breathing heavy. MJ was holding his hand staring at him with wide eyes and her was a mess meaning she had just woken up.</p><p>\u201cYou had a bad dream, love.\u201d MJ soothed him by rubbing circles on his hand. She helped him steady his breathing and she moved her hand to his back to try to calm him better. He looked att her and kissed her passionately. She eased into it and started kissing him back. Once he pulled away he just stared into his eyes for a moment.</p><p>\u201cIt was a terrible, terrible dream.\u201d He said laying back down. MJ laid down with him and got herself comfortable snuggled against him.</p><p>\u201cHow about you tell me all about it tomorrow, love. Tonight lets just go to sleep and have nice dreams.\u201d She smiled up at him and ran her fingers lightly through his hair.</p></p>",

It was getting late and he was beyond exhausted from the fight. He was supposed to go back to the compound for a check-up and to give a report on how his part of the mission went but he so badly wanted to get home to MJ. He hadn&rsquo;t seen her all day since he had to leave early and he couldn&rsquo;t wait to lay in her arms tonight. When he got to his door it was locked which was strange because MJ never locked it unless she knew he wasn&rsquo;t coming home and he had reminded her that he was. </p><p>He took out his keys and unlocked it. Quietly stepping in and dropping his keys into the bowl by the door. He slipped his shoes off and hung his jacket on the hook. As he started walking down the hallway he heard noises coming from their bedroom. He figured she just fell asleep with the TVs on, again. </p><p>He opened the door and to his horror he saw MJ on top of Flash, they both were completely naked. MJ turned around to the sound of the door opened and when she saw Peter standing there she jumped off of Flash and grabbed the sheet to cover herself. Peter felt like he couldn&rsquo;t breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be home so soon.&rdquo; Flash said looking shocked and worried about what was about to come. Peter stood there for a moment trying to truly process what he just saw. His girlfriend of two years was just fucking the guy that had bullied Peter all through high school. He moved over from in front of the door and pointed.</p><p>&ldquo;Out.&rdquo; Peter said holding back tears.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very good manners.&rdquo; Flash joked as he stayed sitting.</p><p>&ldquo;Flash I said get out before I make you.&rdquo; Peter said flatly to him. He had tears welling up in his eyes and he really didn&rsquo;t want him to see him like this. Flash stood up and grabbed his clothes. He quickly got dressed and left. Once Peter heard the door close he walked over to the bed and sat with his back to MJ.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean for you to know about this.&rdquo; MJ said as she crawled across the bed and put her hands onto his shoulders. He rolled his shoulders to get her hands off of him and he just sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;I would hope you didn&rsquo;t want me to see that.&rdquo; He said.
