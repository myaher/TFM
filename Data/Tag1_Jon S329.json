They\u2019ll write ~metas~ claiming that Rhaegar would absolutely hate Jon because he is not a girl, and hate Lyanna too because she delivered a boy instead of a girl. They completely mischaracterize Rhaegar and live in their AU fanfiction world in which Martin\u2019s original characters are nothing like their true selves. Even if Rhaegar believed his child by Lyanna would be a girl (which is still only a theory), there is no evidence or hints whatsoever that he would react negatively toward a boy. Rhaegar is <i>canonically</i> kind and honorable, and to believe him capable of resenting hatred toward his own child is a fallacy. Prophecies are tricky to understand, there should be room left for interpretation, and Rhaegar knows that like no one else. He was conceived for the sake of that prophecy, and he\u2019s been studying it since he was a child.

I don\u2019t get why no plans for Jon were made among those he trusted, for his future. People looooove blaming Catelyn for Jon signing his life away at the Wall but why on earth should she be obligated to keep her husband\u2019s bastard? Ned was his father, he was the one with a duty to him, he was the one who should have arranged something- anything- for him in the North yet he did nothing. He let him join a group of criminals, rapists and murderers just so he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the \u201cyou\u2019re actually a Targ\u201d bit, and presumably so Jon couldn\u2019t do anything with that knowledge. Had his wife live with insult of his presence of him in her home for fourteen years so Jon could be brought up as his son yet he didn\u2019t have faith that he raised him better than that?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, then there\u2019s that bit about how Ned could never burden another with Jon, which takes Howland and Benjen off the table, but he\u2019s fine with burdening his wife. With humiliating, shaming and breaking her heart. How is it any better? Nobody did what Ned did, no man brought their bastard home to his wife yet none of this is ever laid at his feet; Catelyn is instead made the villain for being cold and resentful, even while other women would have smothered him in his sleep. Honorable Neddy won\u2019t put anyone else in danger but hey, he\u2019ll put the lives of Catelyn and the kids at risk every day by keeping Jon under their roof, knowing the consequences should Robert find out, but because it\u2019s Ned, it\u2019s all about <i>his</i> great sacrifice and how amazing he is, like he hasn\u2019t set up his unassuming family to be ruined alongside him. I guess more than the actual text, it\u2019s how fans respond to him and this whole situation that irks me than anything else.</p>\n\n<p>I know his heart is in the right place and it all comes from love but I can\u2019t help as see it as selfish too. I\u2019m just not down with the popular opinion of a perfect, tragically heroic Ned. He failed Catelyn and while I think he did more for Jon than anyone else would have (and I would expect Jon to rightly feel true gratitude once the pain of discovering his parentage fades), I still think he could\u2019ve handled it better and spared them a lot of hurt.

I don\u2019t get why no plans for Jon were made among those he trusted, for his future. People looooove blaming Catelyn for Jon signing his life away at the Wall but why on earth should she be obligated to keep her husband\u2019s bastard? Ned was his father, he was the one with a duty to him, he was the one who should have arranged something- anything- for him in the North yet he did nothing. He let him join a group of criminals, rapists and murderers just so he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the \u201cyou\u2019re actually a Targ\u201d bit, and presumably so Jon couldn\u2019t do anything with that knowledge. Had his wife live with insult of his presence of him in her home for fourteen years so Jon could be brought up as his son yet he didn\u2019t have faith that he raised him better than that?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, then there\u2019s that bit about how Ned could never burden another with Jon, which takes Howland and Benjen off the table, but he\u2019s fine with burdening his wife. With humiliating, shaming and breaking her heart. How is it any better? Nobody did what Ned did, no man brought their bastard home to his wife yet none of this is ever laid at his feet; Catelyn is instead made the villain for being cold and resentful, even while other women would have smothered him in his sleep. Honorable Neddy won\u2019t put anyone else in danger but hey, he\u2019ll put the lives of Catelyn and the kids at risk every day by keeping Jon under their roof, knowing the consequences should Robert find out, but because it\u2019s Ned, it\u2019s all about <i>his</i> great sacrifice and how amazing he is, like he hasn\u2019t set up his unassuming family to be ruined alongside him. I guess more than the actual text, it\u2019s how fans respond to him and this whole situation that irks me than anything else.</p>\n\n<p>I know his heart is in the right place and it all comes from love but I can\u2019t help as see it as selfish too. I\u2019m just not down with the popular opinion of a perfect, tragically heroic Ned. He failed Catelyn and while I think he did more for Jon than anyone else would have (and I would expect Jon to rightly feel true gratitude once the pain of discovering his parentage fades), I still think he could\u2019ve handled it better and spared them a lot of hurt. He had a bunch of shitty options, I know, but I can\u2019t help feel he chose one of the worst, with only one set of promises in mind.</p>",

                "content": "<p>First, because he trusts Catelyn&rsquo;s judgment, since Catelyn&rsquo;s judgment is <i>usually</i>&nbsp;good. It&rsquo;s very much not when it comes to Jon, but as you say, the Blackfish hasn&rsquo;t met Jon and can&rsquo;t possibly know just how bad Catelyn&rsquo;s blind spot there is.</p><p>Second, because Westerosi society is deeply anti-bastard. Specifically, bastards are considered to be treachery-prone and resentful.</p><blockquote><p>They still think me a turncloak. That was a bitter draft to drink, but Jon could not blame them. He was a bastard, after all. Everyone knew that bastards were wanton and treacherous by nature, having been born of lust and deceit.<br /></p><p>- Jon VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bastard children were born from lust and lies, men said; their nature was wanton and treacherous.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>- Jon X, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;All my lovely dromonds.&rdquo; Cersei almost laughed. &ldquo;My lord father used to say that bastards are treacherous by nature. Would that I had listened.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Cersei X, AFFC</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Alys] blushed. &ldquo;So I could meet your brother. Oh, there was some other pretext, but that was the real reason. I was almost of an age with Robb, and my father thought we might make a match. There was a feast. I danced with you and your brother both. He was very courteous and said that I danced beautifully. You were sullen. My father said that was to be expected in a bastard.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Jon IX, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a long-held opinion, appearing in material set before the main series as well.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The old High Septon told my father that king&rsquo;s laws are one thing, and the laws of the gods another,&rdquo; the boy said stubbornly. &ldquo;Trueborn children are made in a marriage bed and blessed by the Father and the Mother, but bastards are born of lust and weakness, he said. King Aegon decreed that his bastards were not bastards, but he could not change their nature. The High Septon said all bastards are born to betrayal &hellip; Daemon Blackfyre, Bittersteel, even Bloodraven. Lord Rivers was more cunning than the other two, he said, but in the end he would prove himself a traitor, too. The High Septon counseled my father never to put any trust in him, nor in any other bastards, great or small.&rdquo;</p><p>Born to betrayal, Dunk thought. Born of lust and weakness. Never to be trusted, great or small. &ldquo;Egg,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you ever think that I might be a bastard?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- The Sworn Sword</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bittersteel be buggered,&rdquo; insisted a familiar voice. &ldquo;No bastard can be trusted, not even him. A few victories will bring him over the water fast enough.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- The Mystery Knight</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragonseeds Ulf White and Hugh Hammer had gone over to the enemy &hellip; but were they the only traitors in their midst?

However, this notion irritates me in the extreme because it mostly hinges on very uncharitable assessments of Kit\u2019s acting, not to mention the egregious warping of Jon Snow\u2019s noble character.</p><p>This business of Jon using the word \u2018but\u201d has to be one of the biggest reaches of them all. Supporters of the theory connect Jon remembering that Ned Stark thought that \u201ceverything before the word \u2018but\u2019 was bullshit\u201d with what Jon said when he pledged to Daenerys: \u201cI\u2019d bend the knee, but\u2013.\u201d At that point in the scene he looks down at his own naked and injured body. To most of us, he is wordlessly explaining his inability to physically get up and kneel before Dany. To a certain corner of the fandom, it means that he has no intention of pledging allegiance to her; that, as a call back to Jon\u2019s comment about Ned, everything before the word \u201cbut\u201d was a lie.\u00a0</p><p>Yes.
