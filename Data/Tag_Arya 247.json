Obsessed with Jaqen H'ghar and Arya Stark and the House of Black and White ;) I love Braavos above all and I hope Arya and Jaqen story will be much better in the next book than what we've got so far in the show. I also love Tyrion  Lannister (really hope he'll get better lines next season), Jon Snow and ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I ship Arya and Jaqen, Tyrion and Tysha (I believe there is hope for them in the book) , Jaime and Brienne, Sansa and Sandor though I also like the idea of Sansa reuniting with Tyrion. I believe Rhaegar Targaryen never raped  Lyanna Stark but saved her from awful Robert Baratheon.",

            "description": "I'm here mostly for Arya x Jaqen or Jaqarya, if you prefer, amazing fanfiction authors whose stories help me to deal with the damage the showmakers did to Arya and Jaqen storyline, especially Braavos part. Obsessed with Jaqen H'ghar and Arya Stark and the House of Black and White ;) I love Braavos above all and I hope Arya and Jaqen story will be much better in the next book than what we've got so far in the show. I also love Tyrion  Lannister (really hope he'll get better lines next season), Jon Snow and ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I ship Arya and Jaqen, Tyrion and Tysha (I believe there is hope for them in the book) , Jaime and Brienne, Sansa and Sandor though I also like the idea of Sansa reuniting with Tyrion. I believe Rhaegar Targaryen never raped  Lyanna Stark but saved her from awful Robert Baratheon.",

Jonrya is a bit of an odd pairing for some people, and that\u2019s cool if so. I fell in love with them after discovering some great fics, not long after GRRM\u2019s original outline for the books came out. And I\u2019ve always been such a sucker for rare pairs.

Neither is Jon, who seems to care far more than he should. But can she trust him? <br/></p><hr><p>The Red Hood Summary:</p><p>It has been seven years since Ned Stark was declared a traitor to the crown and sentenced to the Wall. Now Winter is here and creatures of legend have been stirring in the North. The Three-Eyed Raven told her mother to make Arya a red cloak to protect her on her journey to see Ned. The red hood will keep her safe, the trees whisper. But the long night is indeed dark, and the road north full of terrors. Forced to face the Others, Arya is convinced the cloak will be the death of her. Until the Wolf King and his pack save her life. The price the Wolf King demands for saving her life is high, however, and the bargain struck may cost Arya more than she is willing to give.</p>",

And to answer your question, I once wrote out what House I thought each Starkling should be in, but I lost that paper, so I have to with my gut right now in this moment. (Plus, that was like 5 years ago, I would probably disagree with at least one of them, and still have to remake it lol)</p><p>Robb is a pure Gryffindor to me. Bran a pure Ravenclaw. Like, I do not doubt these two at all and I will stand by these Houses to the end.</p><p>I can\u2019t really get a read on Rickon\u2019s House. I don\u2019t think he would be in Ravenclaw or Slytherin, probably a Gryff or a Puff, but he\u2019s so young in the books and also not a POV character, so it\u2019s hard to get a good grasp on his core personality traits that could help determine a House. We mainly get wild, which suggests Gryffindor, but I still don\u2019t know. I feel Gryffindor wins, but it\u2019s close.</p><p>Arya I feel would be both a good Gryffindor and a good Hufflepuff. I would accept either one of these in a story, and I don\u2019t really have a preference. I Sort her into Hufflepuff just to have a good mix with all the Houses for the Starklings, but I also think she would have been a close Gryffindor and the Sorting Hat took their time in Sorting her before making a final decision.</p><p>Sansa is like Arya, a mix between two Houses and a good fit for both, these two being Ravenclaw and Slytherin. As a Slytherin and one whose favorite character is Sansa, I Sort her into Slytherin. Plus as I mentioned with Arya, it gives a Stark to each House, with Rickon honestly going anywhere, but for my sake Gryffindor.</p><p>And then last, but so not least, Jon. He actually has the exact opposite problem as Rickon. I actually find it hard to Sort Jon into a House because I find he fits into all of them well. I truly don\u2019t care what House he\u2019s in.</p><p>That said, my inner Jonsa shipper finds the idea of Sansa and Jon in Slytherin, both good people grabbling with the history of the House and what their place in the future could be. Sansa from a line of Starks (never concentrated into one House, but they would never be a Slytherin), finding herself under the tutelage of Charms Professor Baelish, and Jon, the scion of well-gossiped about affair between Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Snow, (a Stark cousin in fact) who doesn\u2019t want to follow in the footsteps of his family, but doesn\u2019t see a way out until he meets a Hufflepuff in need, Samwell Tarly.</p><p>But that\u2019s not the asoiaf/hp fusion series, and for that, I think Jon could be in any House, and probably Gryffindor just based on gut feeling.</p><p>Does that help?</p><p>(To be probably too nerdy, I also calculated where each Starkling would be with each other by year. Assuming their ages go within their actual school years [as we don\u2019t know birthdays, and if one was born in September or August to bring them down or up by a year], it would be:</p><p>Sansa\u2019s First year-Robb and Jon are fourth years</p><p>Arya\u2019s first year-Sansa is a third year, Robb and Jon are sixth years</p><p>Bran\u2019s first year-Arya is a third year, Sansa is a fifth year</p><p>Rickon\u2019s first year-Bran is a fifth year, Arya is a seventh year)</p>",
