        "body": "<h1>Why favouritism sucks</h1><p>Recently I came across a video where J.K Rowling was talking about the movies of Hp with Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Kloves, the writer of the Hp movie scripts.</p><p>And something caught my attention. Steve said that his favourite character was not Harry but in fact it was Hermione. And that is when I understood why movie!Hermione is the way she is. </p><p>We know in the books Hermione is smart, independent, brave and strong. However she\u2019s still far from perfect. She has lots of flaws, including lack of empathy, emotional breakdowns during times of crisis, arrogance and narrow mindedness. </p><p>Albeit, in the movies those negative traits are completely absent. Instead she\u2019s the most sensitive and empathetic of the trio, level headed in times of stress and only acts like a know it all in the first movie which makes her totally unrelatable as a character because she\u2019s just perfect. Now that\u2019s not even my main issue here. What really bothers me is how Hermione\u2019s flawless nature affects other character\u2019s portrayal therefore how they\u2019re perceived by the audience. Aside from the fact that Hermione being too flawless takes away her authenticity, it\u2019s also at the expense of other characters. Best example: Ron Weasley. </p><p>A lot of great moments in the books that Ron had were given to Hermione in the movies (like in the 3rd movie when Hermione defended Harry in front of Lupin and Sirius or in the 1st movie when she instantly came up with the spell that saved Ron\u2019s life, even though in the books she freaked out and Ron was the one who calmed her down). So obviously a lot of people that have only watched the movies don\u2019t really care about Ron and think he\u2019s useless. At the same time Hermione is their fave because she\u2019s fierce and smart and sweet (not to mention absolutely beautiful which is also a deviation from the books). And that whole mischaracterization comes from the fact that Hermione was the writer\u2019s fave. She was completely whitewashed since being the writer\u2019s fave results in idealisation and ignorance of flaws. </p><p>That is a huge problem that I\u2019ve also encountered in GoT. The character that is the writer\u2019s fave (D&amp;D and Brian Cogman\u2019s in particular) is Sansa Stark. Beforehand I don\u2019t have a problem with book!Sansa. I actually like her. She\u2019s realistic and fully fleshed out. Show!Sansa however is portrayed as way more compassionate, fierce and superior. I wouldn\u2019t even have a problem with that IF it wasn\u2019t at the expense of other characters, particularly Jon and Arya. They took a lot of elements from Arya\u2019s arc that were only relevant and crucial in her story and gave them to Sansa (the lone wolf speech that was only given to Arya and only appears in her chapters because she is the most pack and family-oriented and fully identifies as a wolf, Sansa as the key to the north even though in the books they emphasise Sansa as being the one with the weakest connection to the north and Arya even being the one that got married off to Ramsay though it was not really Arya but that\u2019s what was believed). They also changed Arya and Sansa\u2019s dynamic and turned Arya into the \u201cproblem\u201d by making her mean and resentful towards Sansa despite it being the other way around in the books. That was in order to make Sansa more likeable and sympathetic. </p><p>Moreover, Sansa is also shown as the \u201csmartest Stark\u201d and clearly superior to the rest. But that\u2019s really not true at all. Arya is incredibly smart and perceptive, she is good at math and knows how to solve problems with cunning and stealth, Jon is a military strategist and Bran is also very wise and insightful. In the show however, they tend to dumb down all the characters that interact with Sansa in order to establish her intelligence and intellectual superiority. (I mean Sansa knowing more about armor than actual armorers that are dealing with this their whole life? Really?) </p><p>That again is the consequence of favouritism. It has come to the point where I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised anymore if Sansa suddenly knew more about ruling and warfare than Dany even though she\u2019s a Queen and knows all about conquering (at least more than Sansa). </p><p>As I\u2019ve already mentioned my problem is not really Sansa\u2019s flawlessness it\u2019s more how that affects other characters\u2019 story lines and personalities. If Arya and Jon were still true to their book counterparts when interacting with Sansa, I would even be fine with that. But that\u2019s not the case. Jon turns into a  dumb idiot and Arya an irrational rage ball when sharing a scene with Sansa. And that change is solely made to prop up Sansa because she\u2019s the show writers\u2019 favourite character (which is also a contradiction in itself because if she was their fave then why would they change her and her story line?). </p><p>My point is favouritism does not just negatively affect the character that\u2019s favoured but also every other character. </p>",

                "content": "<p><h1>Why favouritism sucks</h1><p>Recently I came across a video where J.K Rowling was talking about the movies of Hp with Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Kloves, the writer of the Hp movie scripts.</p><p>And something caught my attention. Steve said that his favourite character was not Harry but in fact it was Hermione. And that is when I understood why movie!Hermione is the way she is. </p><p>We know in the books Hermione is smart, independent, brave and strong. However she&rsquo;s still far from perfect. She has lots of flaws, including lack of empathy, emotional breakdowns during times of crisis, arrogance and narrow mindedness. </p><p>Albeit, in the movies those negative traits are completely absent. Instead she&rsquo;s the most sensitive and empathetic of the trio, level headed in times of stress and only acts like a know it all in the first movie which makes her totally unrelatable as a character because she&rsquo;s just perfect. Now that&rsquo;s not even my main issue here. What really bothers me is how Hermione&rsquo;s flawless nature affects other character&rsquo;s portrayal therefore how they&rsquo;re perceived by the audience. Aside from the fact that Hermione being too flawless takes away her authenticity, it&rsquo;s also at the expense of other characters. Best example: Ron Weasley. </p><p>A lot of great moments in the books that Ron had were given to Hermione in the movies (like in the 3rd movie when Hermione defended Harry in front of Lupin and Sirius or in the 1st movie when she instantly came up with the spell that saved Ron&rsquo;s life, even though in the books she freaked out and Ron was the one who calmed her down). So obviously a lot of people that have only watched the movies don&rsquo;t really care about Ron and think he&rsquo;s useless. At the same time Hermione is their fave because she&rsquo;s fierce and smart and sweet (not to mention absolutely beautiful which is also a deviation from the books). And that whole mischaracterization comes from the fact that Hermione was the writer&rsquo;s fave. She was completely whitewashed since being the writer&rsquo;s fave results in idealisation and ignorance of flaws. </p><p>That is a huge problem that I&rsquo;ve also encountered in GoT. The character that is the writer&rsquo;s fave (D&amp;D and Brian Cogman&rsquo;s in particular) is Sansa Stark. Beforehand I don&rsquo;t have a problem with book!Sansa. I actually like her. She&rsquo;s realistic and fully fleshed out. Show!Sansa however is portrayed as way more compassionate, fierce and superior. I wouldn&rsquo;t even have a problem with that IF it wasn&rsquo;t at the expense of other characters, particularly Jon and Arya. They took a lot of elements from Arya&rsquo;s arc that were only relevant and crucial in her story and gave them to Sansa (the lone wolf speech that was only given to Arya and only appears in her chapters because she is the most pack and family-oriented and fully identifies as a wolf, Sansa as the key to the north even though in the books they emphasise Sansa as being the one with the weakest connection to the north and Arya even being the one that got married off to Ramsay though it was not really Arya but that&rsquo;s what was believed). They also changed Arya and Sansa&rsquo;s dynamic and turned Arya into the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; by making her mean and resentful towards Sansa despite it being the other way around in the books. That was in order to make Sansa more likeable and sympathetic. </p><p>Moreover, Sansa is also shown as the &ldquo;smartest Stark&rdquo; and clearly superior to the rest. But that&rsquo;s really not true at all. Arya is incredibly smart and perceptive, she is good at math and knows how to solve problems with cunning and stealth, Jon is a military strategist and Bran is also very wise and insightful. In the show however, they tend to dumb down all the characters that interact with Sansa in order to establish her intelligence and intellectual superiority. (I mean Sansa knowing more about armor than actual armorers that are dealing with this their whole life? Really?) </p><p>That again is the consequence of favouritism. It has come to the point where I wouldn&rsquo;t even be surprised anymore if Sansa suddenly knew more about ruling and warfare than Dany even though she&rsquo;s a Queen and knows all about conquering (at least more than Sansa). </p><p>As I&rsquo;ve already mentioned my problem is not really Sansa&rsquo;s flawlessness it&rsquo;s more how that affects other characters&rsquo; story lines and personalities.

Jon gently puts Arya down, almost reluctuntly. he tucks an erand strand of hair behind her ear and touches her cheek softly. ignoring the crowd about them as they awkwardly fidget, he then turns to his little brother.</p><p>\"hello, Jon&rdquo; Bran&rsquo;s smile is sad, yet soft. </p><p>Jon covers the distance in two long strides. </p><p>&ndash;and, ok, Isaac is way too tall for this and Kit not enough, but in my head they&rsquo;re not, and so:&ndash;</p><p>he sweeps Bran up too, and swings him around, and kisses his head, and hugs him close as all the heartache and pain and <i>delight</i> wash over him.</p><p>Bran hugs back twice as tight. he shuts his eyes and burries his face in the fur of Jon&rsquo;s coat, and he lets himself be a boy that he had to forget how to be oh so long ago. he lets himself have this, just for a couple of heartbeats. maybe three. just three.</p><p>for three short heartbeats winterfell is not all covered in white. the wind still carries the scent of late summer in his memories, and Bran&rsquo;s ears prickle with the noises of friendly sparring and baby Rickon&rsquo;s high-pitched laughter.

                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>\n\n(2/2) but the dragons can take out a horde of others in a breath, and dany was the one who woke them, so i don&rsquo;t know how her participation in the war and of defeating the Others can be &ldquo;uncertain&rdquo;. not trying to start a fight. as someone who is a huge stark supporter (and a big martell and lannister fan) and not really a targaryen supporter, but someone who does appreciate dany&rsquo;s character, i am curious as to your take on this\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>i&rsquo;m going preface my answer by saying that if daenerys turns out to be azor ahai or the princess that was promised, i wouldn&rsquo;t mind. i&rsquo;m just questioning the idea that she is <b>absolutely necessary</b> for humanity to win.</p><hr /><p>firstly this would be the second invasion of the others/white walkers. in the show the children made them because they were losing their war against humans which will probably be the case in the books. already we know the magic that created them. another thing we&rsquo;re certain of is that humans defeated and pushed back the others/night king without dragons as it happened before the valyrians discovered dragons. unless grrm drops a massive plot twist of another civilisation controlling dragons or dragon like creatures, it&rsquo;s clear that the others/white walkers can be beaten without valyrian steel or dragon fire.</p><p>secondly, bran stark travelled beyond the wall to find the three eyed raven. he also finds the children, the same people whose magic was strong enough to shatter massive parts of a continent and who created the others/night king. bran stark is not only poised to learn from the three eyed raven but also the children using the weirwood trees/whatever show bran uses to see the past. interestingly in the show bran was anxious while talking about the war. he said he still had a lot to learn. if we believe the dany and jon are the saviours theory, then bran has learnt everything he needs to help them (he can see the past and the present and he can warg). i think bran&rsquo;s powers are going to expand and he is going to learn elemental magic that children seem to use. not only that he is going to learn to unmake the night king/fight the great other.</p><p>thirdly, it&rsquo;s agreed upon by the fandom that dany will turn dark in book 6 (dany fans won&rsquo;t use dark but everyone knows daenerys has had enough of peace and caging her dragons). i think most characters&rsquo; darkest moments either start or happen in winds of winter. the difference between other characters and daenerys is that daenerys has dragons and will gain the support of the dothraki. now i&rsquo;m not going to weep for adult slave owners dying but i do think lots of innocent people will die too. i think we&rsquo;ll end up with one astapor after another. i also think dany will blow up king&rsquo;s landing. while she wouldn&rsquo;t know about the wildfire, she&rsquo;d never have the intention of taking westeros peacefully. no matter what a lot of people are going to die needlessly. ask yourself this, would grrm&rsquo;s saviour have that much blood on their hands? he has been careful to make sure the starks stay on the lighter side of moral greyness and we know they&rsquo;ll be involved in the war against the others. why can&rsquo;t he do the same with daenerys? i think because he never intended for her to save humanity.</p><p>finally, grrm&rsquo;s books have been hailed for deconstructing and reconstructing fantasy tropes. so far the biggest deconstructions have been on the characters themselves, usually resulting in their deaths. in my opinion the biggest plot twist has yet to come and it&rsquo;s not jon&rsquo;s parentage, it&rsquo;s bran. a young, disabled boy with ununderstandable powers would be overlooked by most fantasy fans. frodo&rsquo;s necessity as the person who needed to carry the ring is something that is still being questioned decades after the trilogy was released. the same thing is happening with bran. grrm didn&rsquo;t need to see the future to know that his fans would assume dany and jon would be the chosen ones, the characters who&rsquo;ll save the world and have a boring hetero romance. that is the most generic way this could end. the girl whose family was obsessed with fire, who brought fire breathing dragons back, who wants to come to the continent that will be dealing with an invasion of creatures made out of ice. her nephew whose conception was due to prophecy, who wields a sword that can kill the others/ white walkers, who has known about the invasion, who will resurrected.&nbsp;</p><p>of course these two are the main heroes, who else can it be?</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",
