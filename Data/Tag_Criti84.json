Her husband is in this kingdom&hellip; we are but small pieces on this gameboard&hellip; but Nott&rsquo;s husband&hellip; we&rsquo;re hoping to take him back, and I hope this offering makes that easier to do.</p>\n\n<p>Nott to the Queen: Surely even someone of your great stature can realize&hellip; reuniting a family, with their child, is the greatest thing any mother could ask for.</p>\n\n<p>That one badass sounding goblin: I am Sky Syyvil Abriana Miriam, Leader of Den Miriam. I have lived nearly as long as Leylas, and I am a keeper of the history.</p>\n\n<p>Fjord to the Queen: I think I speak for all of us in saying there&rsquo;s no way we could even begin to imagine what you&rsquo;ve seen over 1200 years&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d be honored to learn, if you would.</p> \n\n<p>Caleb: Umavi, I beseech you&hellip;the fact that we have brought what we&rsquo;ve brought to you, I hope shows&hellip; that our people are able to change, and shake off the bonds we have grown up under.</p>\n\n<p>Deucey to the Queen: This object could have been lost forever, in the practical thinking of war.</p>\n\n<p>Beau to the Queen: For a woman so adherent to cycles, I believe you have the power to break them.</p>\n\n<p>Beau to the Nein, in the antechamber after: And that slavery stuff?? We&rsquo;re not doing that anymore. That was stupid. Doing that in a place where it was literally robbing me of my voice? Not super cool.</p>\n\n<p>Fjord to Nott: But what do we know? I know we just talked to a woman that was 1200 years old, that&rsquo;s probably lived a million different lives!
