The large windows were splintered and glass covered the wooden floor. The curtains were ripped and the framed pictures that should have been on the wall laid broken in the midst of the chaos. </p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d His voice trembled and he anxiously looked around.</p><p>The glass cracked beneath his shoes while he made his way to the two bedrooms. Lyanna\u2019s bedroom was almost as chaotic as the living room. The plaids on her bed were torn and ripped. All drawers were open and whatever used to be in there covered the carpet on the floor. All her clothes laid spread out across the room and the closet was completely empty. </p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Jon tried again, but when he opened the door to his own bedroom he froze. </p><p>His computer, his books, the dirty clothes he had forgotten to throw into the laundry basked. It was all gone. What remained was ash and a burning smell that made him sick.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d He screamed now and ran to the kitchen. This time the chaos didn\u2019t surprise him anymore. He took his cellphone from the pocket of his jacket and once more he listened to the voicemail his mom had left him.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Normally Lyanna was the calm one. She never worried before she had to and whenever Jon was nervous she always knew the right things to say to soothe him. But her voice sounded higher than usual and she talked much quicker. \u201cThey found us. Go find Ned Stark and whatever you do\u2026\u201d There was a small pause. \u201cDon&rsquo;t come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Ned Stark?\u201d He shook his head, just like he had done when he had heard the message the first time and had done exactly the one thing his mother hand\u2019t wanted him to do. \u201cAnd what the hell happened here?\u201d Jon murmured. </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d </p><p>Jon reached for the nearest knife and turned around.</p><p>\u201cHell is probably the best possible description of what happened here.\u201d The strange girl let her glance wander over the chaos. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I had nothing to do with this.\u201d She was probably the prettiest girl Jon had ever seen in his life and on her high heels she was a few inches taller than he was. From head to toe she was dressed in tight black clothes accentuating each and every perfectly shaped curve of her body. </p><p>Jon swallowed. \u201cThen what are you doing here in my house?\u201d His voice didn\u2019t sound as steady as he would want to and his heart was hammering in his chest.</p><p>\u201cRescuing you, of course.\u201d She shrugged. Her red hair gleamed in the moonlight and she curled her red lips up into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m Sansa Stark, by the way.\u201d She cocked her head slightly. \u201cAnd we really have to get out of here before whoever, or whatever, has done this comes back.\u201d</p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cStark? Did you just say your last name was Stark?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Sansa\u2019s smile brightened. \u201cAnd I can assure you that if you stay here much longer you will most likely not survive the night.\u201d</p><p>Jon took a deep breath. \u201cI have to find my mom first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d Sansa rolled her eyes. \u201cYou&rsquo;re not gonna find her here. She has either fled, and I hope for your sake she did, or she\u2019s dead.\u201d The smile on her face faded.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t really thought about that last option yet. He hadn\u2019t wanted to, but considering the state of the house he had to admit that it wasn\u2019t even that unlikely. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d Sansa crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cBut I think we know for sure she\u2019s not here anymore.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cSo, are you gonna come with me or not, handsome?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJon\u2026\u201d He interrupted her. \u201cI\u2019m Jon, not handsome.\u201d He swallowed when he realised what he had just said. \u201cI mean, I guess you can call me handsome too, but my name\u2019s Jon.\u201d</p><p>The smile returned to Sansa\u2019s face. \u201cFine, handsome Jon, what is it gonna be? Are you gonna stay here to die or will you come with me so I can help you figure out what has happened here exactly?\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at the chaos once more. </p><p>She was right.</p><p>He had no reason to stay. And if her last name was really Stark, then maybe she\u2019d bring him to the Ned his mother had been talking about. \u201cLet me get\u2026\u201d He was gonna say that he wanted to get some clothes and his toothbrush, but then he remembered the state of his bedroom and his stuff. \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence.</p><p>A loud growl echoed through the apartment and a giant salamander with countless of sharp teeth walked into the kitchen. Saliva dripped on the floor and the monster had its eyes firmly on Jon.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon swallowed. \u201cAm I hallucinating or\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t wait for him to finish his question. She was already facing the monster and clicked her bracelet open. Within an instant she was holding a gigantic glowing sword. \u201cStay behind me.\u201d She bent down and then she charged for the monster. She was quick. Much quicker than a girl on high heels should be, but it seemed that the monster had excellent reflexes. </p><p>It dodged each and every move, as if it was playing with its pray. </p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t just stand there and watch. He tightened his grip on the kitchen knife and he stepped forward to throw himself into the fight. </p><p>But when Sansa noticed what he was doing she looked over her shoulder and during that short moment of distraction the monster threw her aside against the wall. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon screamed, but then he saw that the monster was now dangerously close to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna need something better than a knife, wonderboy!\u201d Sansa pushed herself up and looked at Jon before she threw her glowing sword his way. \u201cFor both our sakes, don\u2019t blow this.\u201d</p><p>Quickly Jon dropped the knife and caught the sword, but when the monster jumped towards him he closed his eyes anyway and waited for its sharp teeth to pierce his skin.</p><p>But the sharp teeth never came. Instead there was nothing but absolute silence.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again he saw a pile of ash where the monster had been and when he looked at Sansa he saw something that looked like pride in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cWelcome to the team, hero.\u201d She pushed herself up and reached out her hand. \u201cBut I do want my sword back.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at the sword he was holding. It felt strangely comfortable to hold it, even though he had never even seen a real sword before.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d She wiggled her fingers and Jon eventually gave the sword back to her. \u201cWe\u2019ll find you one to keep. Considering the state of your house, you\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d She pressed the hilt of the sword to her bare skin and the next moment she was wearing her bracelet again.</p><p>Jon nodded and then he realised he was trembling. \u201cWhat&rsquo;s going on, Sansa?\u201d He tried to focus on her, but the world around him started turning and her bright blue eyes became one big blur. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything to you later.\u201d Sansa wrapped an arm around his waist to steady him. \u201cNow don\u2019t faint yet, okay? Let\u2019s get you out of here first.\u201d</p>",

Much quicker than a girl on high heels should be, but it seemed that the monster had excellent reflexes. </p><p>It dodged each and every move, as if it was playing with its pray. </p><p>Jon couldn&rsquo;t just stand there and watch. He tightened his grip on the kitchen knife and he stepped forward to throw himself into the fight. </p><p>But when Sansa noticed what he was doing she looked over her shoulder and during that short moment of distraction the monster threw her aside against the wall. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; Jon screamed, but then he saw that the monster was now dangerously close to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna need something better than a knife, wonderboy!&rdquo; Sansa pushed herself up and looked at Jon before she threw her glowing sword his way. &ldquo;For both our sakes, don&rsquo;t blow this.&rdquo;</p><p>Quickly Jon dropped the knife and caught the sword, but when the monster jumped towards him he closed his eyes anyway and waited for its sharp teeth to pierce his skin.</p><p>But the sharp teeth never came. Instead there was nothing but absolute silence.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again he saw a pile of ash where the monster had been and when he looked at Sansa he saw something that looked like pride in her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to the team, hero.&rdquo; She pushed herself up and reached out her hand. &ldquo;But I do want my sword back.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon stared at the sword he was holding. It felt strangely comfortable to hold it, even though he had never even seen a real sword before.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; She wiggled her fingers and Jon eventually gave the sword back to her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find you one to keep. Considering the state of your house, you&rsquo;re gonna need it.&rdquo; She pressed the hilt of the sword to her bare skin and the next moment she was wearing her bracelet again.</p><p>Jon nodded and then he realised he was trembling. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Sansa?&rdquo; He tried to focus on her, but the world around him started turning and her bright blue eyes became one big blur. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain everything to you later.&rdquo; Sansa wrapped an arm around his waist to steady him. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t faint yet, okay? Let&rsquo;s get you out of here first.&rdquo;</p>",

But all he finds is a huge chaos and loads of questions. Questions Sansa Stark is more than willing to answer, but only after she makes sure there are no monsters from hell anymore to attack them.</small></p>\n<p><i><small>Shadowhunters AU // Reversed Gender Roles</small></i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; Jon rushed into the apartment and he held his breath when he saw the ravage. For the first time in his entire life the description or a room looking like a bomb had exploded made sense to him. </p>\n<p>The chairs and couch were shredded to pieces. The large windows were splintered and glass covered the wooden floor. The curtains were ripped and the framed pictures that should have been on the wall laid broken in the midst of the chaos. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; His voice trembled and he anxiously looked around.</p>\n<p>The glass cracked beneath his shoes while he made his way to the two bedrooms. Lyanna&rsquo;s bedroom was almost as chaotic as the living room. The plaids on her bed were torn and ripped. All drawers were open and whatever used to be in there covered the carpet on the floor. All her clothes laid spread out across the room and the closet was completely empty. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; Jon tried again, but when he opened the door to his own bedroom he froze. </p>\n<p>His computer, his books, the dirty clothes he had forgotten to throw into the laundry basked. It was all gone. What remained was ash and a burning smell that made him sick.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; He screamed now and ran to the kitchen. This time the chaos didn&rsquo;t surprise him anymore. He took his cellphone from the pocket of his jacket and once more he listened to the voicemail his mom had left him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; Normally Lyanna was the calm one. She never worried before she had to and whenever Jon was nervous she always knew the right things to say to soothe him. But her voice sounded higher than usual and she talked much quicker. &ldquo;They found us. Go find Ned Stark and whatever you do&hellip;&rdquo; There was a small pause. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Ned Stark?&rdquo; He shook his head, just like he had done when he had heard the message the first time and had done exactly the one thing his mother hand&rsquo;t wanted him to do. &ldquo;And what the hell happened here?&rdquo; Jon murmured. </p>\n</p>",

Jon takes after Ned and is recognizably a Stark so that leaves very few candidates as potential parents. With Brandon too dead to father a child, Benjen grounded in Wintefell for the entirety of the rebellion (and on the younger side to be a father besides), and Lyanna the parent Ned wants desperately to conceal, Ned doesn\u2019t exactly have many options to explain a Stark-looking baby that he just happened to pick up on the way back from the south.<br/></p><p>Besides, Ned espouses a model of personal responsibility which limits his willingness to pass Jon as the child of someone else. Ned is the one who made the promise to Lyanna so Jon is his responsibility. Ned isn\u2019t about to taint the memory and reputation of some dead person by claiming they had a bastard, not Brandon, not Ashara, not some random Northern that he would have had to name (and does that random Northern not have a family to claim/raise/suspect the paternity of Jon?). Add to that that Ned isn\u2019t exactly a comfortable liar and that claiming Jon is someone else\u2019s complicates his lie and increases the risk of being caught lying which he absolutely could not afford. Which, again, couldn\u2019t happen because everyone who could have sired Jon was accounted for and Jon is a miniature Ned anyway so it is only logical to claim him himself.</p><p>Once Jon is recognized as his bastard son, Ned has two options on how to proceed: raise Jon in Winterfell or foster him out from an early age. Fostering is the standard practice for noble bastards in Westeros but standard does not mean <i>good</i>. Treating children as embarrassing mistakes to be kept out of sight, or as burdens their noble parent parcels off to be someone else\u2019s problem is not something that happens for the good of those children but rather for the image and benefit of their noble parent and their trueborn kin. It inherently comes with significant psychological and emotional damage to the bastard child that only makes their status as second class citizens felt more acutely. Jon feels his lower station because he is relegated to a lower table during the royals\u2019 visit, so imagine how worse it\u2019d be for him if he is sent away from Winterfell altogether, which sends a message that he is not fit to raise with the trueborn children and has no place among them. Likewise, Jon\u2019s internalized shame about his existence and his mother could only surge if he is treated as a shameful mistake that needs to be hidden away.
