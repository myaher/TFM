Sometimes, I\u2019d like to kiss you goodbye,\u201d She whispered back as her fingers kept running through his hair. Her nails scratched his scalp causing him to almost let out a purr.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t reply, knowing this wasn\u2019t part of the relationship they had. Whenever he came back from whatever country he visited, he stopped by her place to stay the night.</p><p>Friends with benefits and nothing more.</p><p>Three months ago, she was strong enough and declined the dinner he offered her. But she knew she was falling for him, further down into the abyss she was sure to never return from.

Sometimes, when he looked at her with a sad expression she would feel bad, however, she also knew that it was for the best.</p><p>Y/N already told herself this needed to stop two weeks ago, but she still let him in when he knocked on her door last night. And she still let him pick her up and wrap her legs around his hips while he attacked her neck with his lips and teeth. She let him undress her, kiss her breathless and, most importantly, love her, while she knew it meant nothing more than sex to him. But she let that tiny flame of hope burn deep within the cavities of her heart.</p><p>It was quiet between them, her fingers now tracing the outlines of his arc reactor, the glowing metal cool beneath her fingertips. The alarm rang through the room, disturbing the silence Y/N clung to with a desperation she didn\u2019t know she had. He reached to turn it off but didn\u2019t make an attempt to get out of bed.</p><p>She closed her eyes when she felt his fingers comb through her hair.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could hate you sometimes,\u201d</p><p>Her words were quiet, a mere whisper to herself but it clung to the thick, tense air in the room and loomed over them like a threatening shadow. She didn\u2019t mean for him to hear the words despite her addressing him directly, but of course, he heard, his face was a few inches away from hers.</p><p>Tony let out a soft gasp of surprise as the harshness of her words bit into his very being. He was about to speak up, but she interrupted his attempt, \u201cSometimes, I wish I was strong enough to just say no. to slam the door in your face and let you stand outside with an open mouth. I want to leave you, so you can search for another girl to have during the night \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t get attached so easily.\u201d Her words were spoken as soft as the ones before, her tone vulnerable and shaky.</p><p>Precisely how she felt.</p><p>Tony let her words sink in and settle deep within his heart, causing it to ache at hat she said. He wanted her to have told him earlier, so he could say he loved her and he was always about to tell her he wanted her to come with him everytime he left. But she pushed him away, making him hesitate about his feelings towards her and masking them with the usual cocky exterior he built up over the years.</p><p>At these moments though, he was somehow sure he loved her and always wanted to have her by his side no matter what.</p><p>\u201cBut you are Tony Stark. You don\u2019t care and that\u2019s okay, this between us is not built to care for each other or-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d</p><p>The words escaped him before they went through any of the remaining filters he had inside of his brain. Y/N blinked in surprise, not sure if he said that so she wouldn\u2019t end this \u2018deal\u2019 or if he really meant it.</p><p>\u201cPack your bags, come with me,\u201d he continued, caressing her cheeks with the back of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N stammered, her eyes still wide like saucers and her mouth hung slightly agape. She wasn\u2019t sure what Tony was saying and her heart told her to not get her hopes up too hastily.</p><p>Maybe she was still fast asleep, and this was all just a dream when she woke up he would most likely be gone again.</p><p>But as she pinched her arm, a sharp pain told her this was, in fact, not a dream at all. It was real, and the realisation caused goosebumps to raise upon her skin, covering her entire body.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Come on!\u201d Lewis threw the covers off him and stood up, pulling her with him. He gripped her by the waist and twirled her in the air making her let out a surprised sound that was somewhere between a squeal and a giggle.</p><p>As he set her back on her feet, she stared into his deep eyes in awe, \u201cSay it again,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d He repeated, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</p><p>Y/N broke out into a huge grin, a giggle escaping her, \u201cI love you too,\u201d</p><p>Their lips met in a sweet, soft kiss, causing her to melt in his arms as she felt the care and passion he put into this gesture they\u2019ve done so many times before. But this time it was different, his lips didn\u2019t feel like the rough hastiness anymore.</p><p>They felt like home.</p><p><i>&mdash;</i></p><p><i>Feel free to leave a message or ask if you wanna be added to my taglist!</i></p><p><b><i>Taglist: </i></b><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJq-eoonykR-dTQXvOpi-HQ\">@thatsunacceptable</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHiWIvrecC3XOqmZzM6U5rg\">@jitterbuck</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH453YlOosB8xU6p4AZ278w\">@kuro-no-kenshi</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwoFuu5hzk-y5VbDvQsoRSw\">@bellamyblakemorley</a></i></p>",

Her nails scratched his scalp causing him to almost let out a purr.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t reply, knowing this wasn\u2019t part of the relationship they had. Whenever he came back from whatever country he visited, he stopped by her place to stay the night.</p><p>Friends with benefits and nothing more.</p><p>Three months ago, she was strong enough and declined the dinner he offered her. But she knew she was falling for him, further down into the abyss she was sure to never return from. Declining one dinner wouldn\u2019t make the difference.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel the same way, she was sure of that. After all, he showed her as much when he came by her apartment smelling like a way too expensive feminine perfume.</p><p>She also kept pushing him away to keep it that way. Sometimes, when he looked at her with a sad expression she would feel bad, however, she also knew that it was for the best.</p><p>Y/N already told herself this needed to stop two weeks ago, but she still let him in when he knocked on her door last night. And she still let him pick her up and wrap her legs around his hips while he attacked her neck with his lips and teeth. She let him undress her, kiss her breathless and, most importantly, love her, while she knew it meant nothing more than sex to him. But she let that tiny flame of hope burn deep within the cavities of her heart.</p><p>It was quiet between them, her fingers now tracing the outlines of his arc reactor, the glowing metal cool beneath her fingertips. The alarm rang through the room, disturbing the silence Y/N clung to with a desperation she didn\u2019t know she had. He reached to turn it off but didn\u2019t make an attempt to get out of bed.</p><p>She closed her eyes when she felt his fingers comb through her hair.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could hate you sometimes,\u201d</p><p>Her words were quiet, a mere whisper to herself but it clung to the thick, tense air in the room and loomed over them like a threatening shadow. She didn\u2019t mean for him to hear the words despite her addressing him directly, but of course, he heard, his face was a few inches away from hers.</p><p>Tony let out a soft gasp of surprise as the harshness of her words bit into his very being. He was about to speak up, but she interrupted his attempt, \u201cSometimes, I wish I was strong enough to just say no. to slam the door in your face and let you stand outside with an open mouth. I want to leave you, so you can search for another girl to have during the night \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t get attached so easily.\u201d Her words were spoken as soft as the ones before, her tone vulnerable and shaky.</p><p>Precisely how she felt.</p><p>Tony let her words sink in and settle deep within his heart, causing it to ache at hat she said. He wanted her to have told him earlier, so he could say he loved her and he was always about to tell her he wanted her to come with him everytime he left. But she pushed him away, making him hesitate about his feelings towards her and masking them with the usual cocky exterior he built up over the years.</p><p>At these moments though, he was somehow sure he loved her and always wanted to have her by his side no matter what.</p><p>\u201cBut you are Tony Stark. You don\u2019t care and that\u2019s okay, this between us is not built to care for each other or-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d</p><p>The words escaped him before they went through any of the remaining filters he had inside of his brain. Y/N blinked in surprise, not sure if he said that so she wouldn\u2019t end this \u2018deal\u2019 or if he really meant it.</p><p>\u201cPack your bags, come with me,\u201d he continued, caressing her cheeks with the back of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N stammered, her eyes still wide like saucers and her mouth hung slightly agape. She wasn\u2019t sure what Tony was saying and her heart told her to not get her hopes up too hastily.</p><p>Maybe she was still fast asleep, and this was all just a dream when she woke up he would most likely be gone again.</p><p>But as she pinched her arm, a sharp pain told her this was, in fact, not a dream at all. It was real, and the realisation caused goosebumps to raise upon her skin, covering her entire body.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Come on!\u201d Lewis threw the covers off him and stood up, pulling her with him. He gripped her by the waist and twirled her in the air making her let out a surprised sound that was somewhere between a squeal and a giggle.</p><p>As he set her back on her feet, she stared into his deep eyes in awe, \u201cSay it again,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d He repeated, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</p><p>Y/N broke out into a huge grin, a giggle escaping her, \u201cI love you too,\u201d</p><p>Their lips met in a sweet, soft kiss, causing her to melt in his arms as she felt the care and passion he put into this gesture they\u2019ve done so many times before.
