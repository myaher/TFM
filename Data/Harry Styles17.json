You lazily look up at your boyfriend and smile, admiring him as he slips into his royal blue suit.</p><p>Of course, he looked glorious, as he always did, but there was just something about the blue of the suit that made it a lot sexier. Maybe it was because the blue complimented his eyes, accentuating the green and making them pop, adding that mischievous sparkle you adored so much.</p><p>It could also be the way the trousers clung to his upper half, accentuating his ass and making it look glorious. The bits of fabric flow down and out, hiding the glorious muscles beneath. However when he sat, the fabric would tighten, the muscle evident against the fabric.</p><p>Then you had to white vest beneath the blazer, tucked into the trousers so no tummy would show. The low cut of the vest showed just enough chest to make anyone crazy. The heads and wings of the bird tattoos slightly peeking through, covered mostly from the public eye, but shown just enough that you knew they were there. The small amount of chest hair was visible, caressed by the small silver chain of his cross. Of course, you wish it was your face caressing his chest, laying lazily against the warm, sweaty skin, your finger playing with the small hairs, your fingertips dancing across the inked skin, tracing the patterns that were memorised in your head.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful\u201d You whisper, your words dancing in the air. He looks around to you and smiles, his dimples peeking through at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSays the naked girl sprawled across my bed\u201d He wanders to you slowly, kneeling down onto the mattress. He leans down, his fingers gently holding your chin up so that he can kiss your lips.<br/></p><p>You smile into the kiss, your teeth showing as he pulls back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour hair is a little too neat, I could mess that up for you\u201d You whisper, trailing your finger across the hem of his vest. He smiles wickedly at you, licking his lips as he turns to lie flat on his back, sprawling his arms behind his head as he watches you with glistening eyes.<br/></p><p>You push yourself up and swing your leg over him, straddling his waist as you lean down to press your chest to his. He watches you as you place gentle kisses to his chest, biting at the skin as you giggle.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not walking the carpet so&hellip;.I guess we could waste some time before I leave\u201d He replies, sitting up. His arms come around your body and slide down your back, his fingertips brushing your skin as he roughly gropes your ass.<br/></p><p>You grind into him slightly, feeling the hardness growing beneath you. You smile and wrap your arms around his neck, your fingers tugging at the back of his hair roughly. You feel your core heat, the wetness dripping between your thighs as he bites at your neck, sucking at the area.</p><p>\u201cWe should pull these trousers down before I destroy them\u201d You groan, lifting your hips for him to quickly unbutton his trousers and pull them down. He springs free from the fabric, the hardness hitting his vest, you smile at the realization of him not wearing boxers, your core aching for him more.<br/></p><p>As his lips meet yours you feel his fingers dance along your skin, leaving trails of goosebumps as he reaches down to pinch at your throbbing clit. You cry suddenly, your body arching into him as an electric sensation rushes through you, your legs shuddering beneath you as you fall onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cAlways so sensitive for me\u201d He smiles, his lips moving against yours.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The kiss is rushed, messy but passionate, both of you filling each other with multiple feelings.\u00a0The kiss is not as a movie would describe, hell its better than anything a movie could attempt to explain. Its as if you were both ignited with passion, a promise for real feelings and primal desires.</p><p>\u201cRaise for me\u201d He groans, his hands bring his cock up to your entrance. He slides through your folds, collecting wetness before tickling at your entrance, pushing into you slightly. You watch as his head rolls back, your body lowering onto him, your core expanding and stretching to fit him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He fills you completely, your back arching slightly as the pleasure washes over you in waves. You feel his hands squeeze your ass, lifting your hips up slightly. You feel his fingers digging into your flesh, most likely leaving purple marks that would last a few days, claiming you as his.</p><p>\u201cHow long do we have?\u201d You whimper, raising up to push back down, his tip hitting your wall in just the right spot. You shudder, clenching your thighs to his and your rest your forehead to his.<br/></p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes\u201d He groans, pulling your chest flush to his. Your body is slick with sweat as you continue your pace, your fingernails scratching at his scalp as you pull roughly at his hair.<br/></p><p>He groans with each tug of his hair, his hips bucking up to meet you forcefully as you pull and torment him. His moans fill the room, mingling with yours and creating a song, a song so beautiful that you wish you could keep it, and replay it whenever you missed him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe should be quick then\u201d You moan, your core aching as he continues the rhythm, his fingers coming down to pinch at your clit. You feel him twitch within you, telling you that he was close to reaching his end.<br/></p><p>His teeth bite into your flesh, his lips sucking at the area as you push down harder, feeling his hips push up to meet your thrusts. He was being possessive and passionate, leaving marks wherever he wanted, branding you as his, and you didn\u2019t care, you loved each purple mark left against your skin, each with a different story of passion and love.</p><p>You pull at his hair harder, feeling him growl against your neck. You smile and let your eyes trail his face, your lips turning up as you kiss the crease between his eyebrows. His eyes open and his lips curl up, his eyes twinkling as he stares at you. You see the passion and love behind his eyes, twirling around like a storm.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful riding me, you know that love\u201d He growls, his eyes fluttering closed as you clench around him. You feel his body jolt beneath you, his muscles tensing as he circles his fingers at your clit, pinching at the bud of nerves and smiling as you wiggle on top of him, feeding off your pleasure and suffering.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close\u201d You whimper, holding onto his shoulders and clawing at his skin, leaving your own marks, branding him as yours.<br/></p><p>As you claw at the skin you feel him grab at your hips, forcing you to push down harder on him, hitting the exact spot that had you crying. You cry out his name as your body shudders, your legs clenching into him as the knot within your core bursts, pulsating bursts of electricity up your spine.</p><p>You clench yourself around him, feeling his body still as he thrusts up slowly into you, hot bursts coating you on the inside, claiming you in a different way. You rest your head against his and smile, your chest heaving as you both settle against each other. As you both catch your breaths you smile, feeling him press delicate kisses to your jawline.</p><p>\u201cCan we freeze time\u201d You whisper,\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be perfect\u201d He smiles, pressing his lips gently to yours.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You smile and begin to climb off him, a string of cum falling down your legs as you smile at him. Gently you reach your hand to his and pull him up, resting your hand to the white vest, your fingers brushing his chest hair as you look up at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have time for a quick rinse, your all sweaty?\u201d You question, twirling your fingers on his chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cHop in and out yeah, quickly turn the water on,\u201d He calls, his smirk cruel as you sway your hips, walking into the bathroom with a smile.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to dodge me then\u201d\u00a0 You call, rushing to turn the water on.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You step into the water and smile as he comes into view, completely naked. His skin glistens against the light, the sweat making it look as if his skin was glowing. You watch as he walks to the mirror, his fingers coming up to smooth his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell did mess it up didn\u2019t you love\u201d He chuckles, looking at you with a smile. You shrug and smile, acting innocent as you lean your head back into the water,<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I did my best\u201d<br/></p>",

His arms come around your body and slide down your back, his fingertips brushing your skin as he roughly gropes your ass.<br></p><p>You grind into him slightly, feeling the hardness growing beneath you. You smile and wrap your arms around his neck, your fingers tugging at the back of his hair roughly. You feel your core heat, the wetness dripping between your thighs as he bites at your neck, sucking at the area.</p><p>\u201cWe should pull these trousers down before I destroy them\u201d You groan, lifting your hips for him to quickly unbutton his trousers and pull them down. He springs free from the fabric, the hardness hitting his vest, you smile at the realization of him not wearing boxers, your core aching for him more.<br></p><p>As his lips meet yours you feel his fingers dance along your skin, leaving trails of goosebumps as he reaches down to pinch at your throbbing clit. You cry suddenly, your body arching into him as an electric sensation rushes through you, your legs shuddering beneath you as you fall onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cAlways so sensitive for me\u201d He smiles, his lips moving against yours.\u00a0<br></p><p>The kiss is rushed, messy but passionate, both of you filling each other with multiple feelings.\u00a0The kiss is not as a movie would describe, hell its better than anything a movie could attempt to explain. Its as if you were both ignited with passion, a promise for real feelings and primal desires.</p><p>\u201cRaise for me\u201d He groans, his hands bring his cock up to your entrance. He slides through your folds, collecting wetness before tickling at your entrance, pushing into you slightly. You watch as his head rolls back, your body lowering onto him, your core expanding and stretching to fit him.\u00a0<br></p><p>He fills you completely, your back arching slightly as the pleasure washes over you in waves. You feel his hands squeeze your ass, lifting your hips up slightly. You feel his fingers digging into your flesh, most likely leaving purple marks that would last a few days, claiming you as his.</p><p>\u201cHow long do we have?\u201d You whimper, raising up to push back down, his tip hitting your wall in just the right spot. You shudder, clenching your thighs to his and your rest your forehead to his.<br></p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes\u201d He groans, pulling your chest flush to his. Your body is slick with sweat as you continue your pace, your fingernails scratching at his scalp as you pull roughly at his hair.<br></p><p>He groans with each tug of his hair, his hips bucking up to meet you forcefully as you pull and torment him. His moans fill the room, mingling with yours and creating a song, a song so beautiful that you wish you could keep it, and replay it whenever you missed him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe should be quick then\u201d You moan, your core aching as he continues the rhythm, his fingers coming down to pinch at your clit. You feel him twitch within you, telling you that he was close to reaching his end.<br></p><p>His teeth bite into your flesh, his lips sucking at the area as you push down harder, feeling his hips push up to meet your thrusts. He was being possessive and passionate, leaving marks wherever he wanted, branding you as his, and you didn\u2019t care, you loved each purple mark left against your skin, each with a different story of passion and love.</p><p>You pull at his hair harder, feeling him growl against your neck. You smile and let your eyes trail his face, your lips turning up as you kiss the crease between his eyebrows. His eyes open and his lips curl up, his eyes twinkling as he stares at you. You see the passion and love behind his eyes, twirling around like a storm.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful riding me, you know that love\u201d He growls, his eyes fluttering closed as you clench around him. You feel his body jolt beneath you, his muscles tensing as he circles his fingers at your clit, pinching at the bud of nerves and smiling as you wiggle on top of him, feeding off your pleasure and suffering.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close\u201d You whimper, holding onto his shoulders and clawing at his skin, leaving your own marks, branding him as yours.<br></p><p>As you claw at the skin you feel him grab at your hips, forcing you to push down harder on him, hitting the exact spot that had you crying. You cry out his name as your body shudders, your legs clenching into him as the knot within your core bursts, pulsating bursts of electricity up your spine.</p><p>You clench yourself around him, feeling his body still as he thrusts up slowly into you, hot bursts coating you on the inside, claiming you in a different way. You rest your head against his and smile, your chest heaving as you both settle against each other. As you both catch your breaths you smile, feeling him press delicate kisses to your jawline.</p><p>\u201cCan we freeze time\u201d You whisper,\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be perfect\u201d He smiles, pressing his lips gently to yours.\u00a0<br></p><p>You smile and begin to climb off him, a string of cum falling down your legs as you smile at him. Gently you reach your hand to his and pull him up, resting your hand to the white vest, your fingers brushing his chest hair as you look up at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have time for a quick rinse, your all sweaty?\u201d You question, twirling your fingers on his chest.<br></p><p>\u201cHop in and out yeah, quickly turn the water on,\u201d He calls, his smirk cruel as you sway your hips, walking into the bathroom with a smile.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to dodge me then\u201d\u00a0 You call, rushing to turn the water on.\u00a0<br></p><p>You step into the water and smile as he comes into view, completely naked. His skin glistens against the light, the sweat making it look as if his skin was glowing. You watch as he walks to the mirror, his fingers coming up to smooth his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell did mess it up didn\u2019t you love\u201d He chuckles, looking at you with a smile. You shrug and smile, acting innocent as you lean your head back into the water,<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I did my best\u201d<br></p></p>",

You lazily look up at your boyfriend and smile, admiring him as he slips into his royal blue suit.</p><p>Of course, he looked glorious, as he always did, but there was just something about the blue of the suit that made it a lot sexier. Maybe it was because the blue complimented his eyes, accentuating the green and making them pop, adding that mischievous sparkle you adored so much.</p><p>It could also be the way the trousers clung to his upper half, accentuating his ass and making it look glorious. The bits of fabric flow down and out, hiding the glorious muscles beneath. However when he sat, the fabric would tighten, the muscle evident against the fabric.</p><p>Then you had to white vest beneath the blazer, tucked into the trousers so no tummy would show. The low cut of the vest showed just enough chest to make anyone crazy. The heads and wings of the bird tattoos slightly peeking through, covered mostly from the public eye, but shown just enough that you knew they were there. The small amount of chest hair was visible, caressed by the small silver chain of his cross. Of course, you wish it was your face caressing his chest, laying lazily against the warm, sweaty skin, your finger playing with the small hairs, your fingertips dancing across the inked skin, tracing the patterns that were memorised in your head.</p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful&rdquo; You whisper, your words dancing in the air. He looks around to you and smiles, his dimples peeking through at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Says the naked girl sprawled across my bed&rdquo; He wanders to you slowly, kneeling down onto the mattress. He leans down, his fingers gently holding your chin up so that he can kiss your lips.<br /></p><p>You smile into the kiss, your teeth showing as he pulls back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Your hair is a little too neat, I could mess that up for you&rdquo; You whisper, trailing your finger across the hem of his vest. He smiles wickedly at you, licking his lips as he turns to lie flat on his back, sprawling his arms behind his head as he watches you with glistening eyes.<br /></p><p>You push yourself up and swing your leg over him, straddling his waist as you lean down to press your chest to his.
