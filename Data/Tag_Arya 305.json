GRRM has made Daenerys T. and Arya S. incredibly similar, from monstrous pets, to being exiled and having similar predispositions towards the common folk, what is the actual need of two female characters being almost similar? Because I definitely do not subscribe to the belief of Daenerys dying in some holy sacrificial way, and Arya's future remains unclear with all three of her surviving brothers closer to home than she is.",
        "answer": "<p>I see Arya and Dany representing two types of the disenfranchised female for the express purpose of showing, later on, that females in a strictly patriarchal society can rise above gendered oppression and wield power in a way that is equal to (and in some cases, even above) male power players.

They were many stark (pun intended) differences in their upbringings.

Dany\u2019s lowest point is with a dead husband, few followers, infant dragons, lost and dying in the desert, and constantly afraid of all the people that want her dead. Arya\u2019s is with dead parents, dead siblings, a lost direwolf she\u2019s convinced hates her, homeless in Westeros, and on the run from those who want her captured or killed.
