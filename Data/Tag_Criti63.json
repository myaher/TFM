Also a lapsed pagan, it sounds like nonsense but idk how else to describe it. More things- gluten free, and crochet, knitting, and others. Beware of my many random posts as well.</p><p>That is all for now! </p><p>Oh BTW I am bad at tagging things, trying to get better, but its a work in progress.</p>",

Syldor is simply another customer and Gilmore another shop keeper in another town that he got assigned to in his role as a ambassador. They talk for a while, a professional but pleasent conversation about the books at the shop, since Syldor\u2019s looking to expand his home library.\u00a0</p><p>They are interrupted by loud bickering as the door swings open and the twins waltz in, neither noticing nor caring that Gilmore is busy with a customer. As he calls them out on it, asking them to take their squabble somewhere else, that\u2019s when they take notice. And so does Syldor.\u00a0</p><p>There they are, the children, now apparently teenagers, who ran away from him, his city, and everything he stands for. A couple of years ago now, but seeing them now he can feel his anger bubbling up again. He\u2019d tried to find them, for a while at least, and to just run into them here, it almost seems like the universe itself wants to spite him.\u00a0</p><p>Shaun notices that the twins suddenly grow still, their fighting completely forgotten, and as they move a little bit closer to each other he can see a flicker of fear across their faces. His gaze moves from his adopted children to his customer, and suddenly he wonders how he hadn\u2019t noticed the similiarities before. With cold dread crawling up his spine, he notices that this man must be their father. Biological, anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Before any of the other parties can speak he clears his throat, at least succeeding in getting everyone\u2019s attention again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow, I think we are quite done here. It appears I have something else to attend to, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he says, giving Syldor his widest customer service smile, while at the same time making it clear that the conversation is done. He walks over to the twins, wrapping his arms around both their (still too small, even if they nearly reach his neck now) shoulders. They are gently dragged back by him until the door way is free, another clue for Syldor that he is not welcome anymore.<br/></p><p>And he gets the hint, clearly, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s happy about it though. The look he gives them on his way out, but even more so the comment that he will be back (a bit too threatening in Shaun\u2019s opinion), make him worry. But he can\u2019t let the twins see that, so for now he calmly closes up the shop and usheres them both back into their living quarters.\u00a0</p><p>They are both visibly shaken, and only now does he realize that they don\u2019t know\u00a0 that this was a coincidence. For all they know, Syldor could have found them on their own, or Gilmore could have found him and invited him in.\u00a0</p><p>Not that either of them ever told him the man\u2019s name, he still doesn\u2019t know it, but they did tell him the city they came from and that their father was an asshole of relative importance. He just has to make sure they believe him, that he had no idea who he was talking to.\u00a0</p><hr><p>It definitely shakes things up, but he still feels like they come out of it stronger. The twins actually talk about their past now, a little bit, about how they were taken from their mother and how living with their father was unbearable. About the disdain and the abuse they were subjected to in the elven city, and how they had eventually made their plan to escape.\u00a0</p><p>Vax reacts the strongest at first, at least outwardly, and it\u2019s hard to raign him in again. They talk a lot, and while Vax wears his heart on his sleeve (how he will survive in this world one day is a mystery to Gilmore, the boy has too much love to give and not enough people he trusts), he can also be incredible stubborn about not talking about any of it when he wants to. When he does, it tends to become too much. It\u2019s a slow process, but he seems to realize eventually that the man who has taken care of them for three years now is not going to let them go so easily.\u00a0</p><p>Vex, on the other hand, likes to pretend like nothing\u2019s wrong at first. She goes about business as always, not as brooding as her brother, but she grows quiet. Very quiet. Spending more time with Trinket in the woods or clinging to her brother, like she\u2019s always waiting for the other show to drop. She sleeps uneasy, he knows that, and while nightmares are not uncommon for both of his children, he knows that it\u2019s gotten worse for her.\u00a0</p><p>All of it seems to come to a head for her one day, or rather night, when she knocks at his door far after midnight with tears streaming down her face and the timid question if they can talk.\u00a0</p><p>He learns a lot that night, not neccissarily about Syldor, but about her. He\u2019s not even sure why this came up now, but he\u2019s nonetheless glad that she came to him to talk about it. And it seems to change something in their relationship, for the better, because she trusted him with something she has never told anyone else, and trusts him to keep it between the two of them.\u00a0</p><p>And if she feels a little lighter after that, a little bit happier, that\u2019s all he could ever ask for.\u00a0</p><hr><p>It takes a while before Syldor, a name he now knows, comes back. There are no guards with him though, no lawyers or anyone else who could force him to give up his children.\u00a0</p><p>That doesn\u2019t neccissarily mean that Syldor doesn\u2019t want them back, but Gilmore realizes quickly that he\u2019s not as forceful about it as he could be. The way the man all but haggles about his own flesh and blood is appaling, quite frankly, and if Gilmore didn\u2019t have his own interest to take care of in this deal (and gods does he hate this word when it\u2019s applied to Vax and Vex) he would berate him for his behaviour.\u00a0</p><p>The compromise they reach is easier, a lot easier than either had hoped, most likely. They stay where they are, and Syldor can rid himself of any and all responsibilites.\u00a0</p><p>Technically, Gilmore had already signed them up as his own, but they both know that this will only be efective in Emon. On paper, they now have family ties there as well as back in Syngorn. It\u2019s one of the points the shop keeper insisted on. Should they ever feel the need to return to the elven city, for whatever reason, he doesn\u2019t want their stand to be even worse than it already is.\u00a0</p><p>One thing that he had to give up in the compromise, in return, is the knowledge that Syldor has another family now. That the twins have another sister and, even they would probably not care much about that, a step mother. He wants to tell them, thinks that they deserve to know, but Syldor, for whatever reason, is not willing to give them that. Then again, maybe Gilmore shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he\u2019s trying to keep his\u00a0\u201cpure blood\u201d daughter (it tastes like ash, even when he doesn\u2019t speak these words out loud) as far away from his other children as possible. Once the twins do find out about it, and he\u2019s sure they will, he\u2019s prepared to be resented for keeping it from them. For now, the deal seems worth it.\u00a0</p><p>Once the negotiations between the two men are over, Gilmore is sure that he hasn\u2019t felt such hatred for someone else in a long time. But at least his kids are save, and he will be able to keep them close. At least they weren\u2019t the ones who had to deal with this. He doesn\u2019t tell them about the whole process, only assures them that their father won\u2019t come back. And in a city as big as Emon, he hopes that\u2019s enough to keep them away from him.\u00a0</p>",

They talk a lot, and while Vax wears his heart on his sleeve (how he will survive in this world one day is a mystery to Gilmore, the boy has too much love to give and not enough people he trusts), he can also be incredible stubborn about not talking about any of it when he wants to. When he does, it tends to become too much. It\u2019s a slow process, but he seems to realize eventually that the man who has taken care of them for three years now is not going to let them go so easily.\u00a0</p><p>Vex, on the other hand, likes to pretend like nothing\u2019s wrong at first. She goes about business as always, not as brooding as her brother, but she grows quiet. Very quiet. Spending more time with Trinket in the woods or clinging to her brother, like she\u2019s always waiting for the other show to drop. She sleeps uneasy, he knows that, and while nightmares are not uncommon for both of his children, he knows that it\u2019s gotten worse for her.\u00a0</p><p>All of it seems to come to a head for her one day, or rather night, when she knocks at his door far after midnight with tears streaming down her face and the timid question if they can talk.\u00a0</p><p>He learns a lot that night, not neccissarily about Syldor, but about her. He\u2019s not even sure why this came up now, but he\u2019s nonetheless glad that she came to him to talk about it. And it seems to change something in their relationship, for the better, because she trusted him with something she has never told anyone else, and trusts him to keep it between the two of them.\u00a0</p><p>And if she feels a little lighter after that, a little bit happier, that\u2019s all he could ever ask for.\u00a0</p><hr><p>It takes a while before Syldor, a name he now knows, comes back. There are no guards with him though, no lawyers or anyone else who could force him to give up his children.\u00a0</p><p>That doesn\u2019t neccissarily mean that Syldor doesn\u2019t want them back, but Gilmore realizes quickly that he\u2019s not as forceful about it as he could be. The way the man all but haggles about his own flesh and blood is appaling, quite frankly, and if Gilmore didn\u2019t have his own interest to take care of in this deal (and gods does he hate this word when it\u2019s applied to Vax and Vex) he would berate him for his behaviour.\u00a0</p><p>The compromise they reach is easier, a lot easier than either had hoped, most likely. They stay where they are, and Syldor can rid himself of any and all responsibilites.\u00a0</p><p>Technically, Gilmore had already signed them up as his own, but they both know that this will only be efective in Emon. On paper, they now have family ties there as well as back in Syngorn. It\u2019s one of the points the shop keeper insisted on. Should they ever feel the need to return to the elven city, for whatever reason, he doesn\u2019t want their stand to be even worse than it already is.\u00a0</p><p>One thing that he had to give up in the compromise, in return, is the knowledge that Syldor has another family now. That the twins have another sister and, even they would probably not care much about that, a step mother. He wants to tell them, thinks that they deserve to know, but Syldor, for whatever reason, is not willing to give them that. Then again, maybe Gilmore shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he\u2019s trying to keep his\u00a0\u201cpure blood\u201d daughter (it tastes like ash, even when he doesn\u2019t speak these words out loud) as far away from his other children as possible. Once the twins do find out about it, and he\u2019s sure they will, he\u2019s prepared to be resented for keeping it from them. For now, the deal seems worth it.\u00a0</p><p>Once the negotiations between the two men are over, Gilmore is sure that he hasn\u2019t felt such hatred for someone else in a long time. But at least his kids are save, and he will be able to keep them close. At least they weren\u2019t the ones who had to deal with this. He doesn\u2019t tell them about the whole process, only assures them that their father won\u2019t come back. And in a city as big as Emon, he hopes that\u2019s enough to keep them away from him.\u00a0</p>",
