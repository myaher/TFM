He also always makes sure that you are feeling okay, cleaning you up if need be and cuddling with you.</p><p><b>B = Body part </b>(Their favorite body part of theirs and also their partner\u2019s)<br/>You love Jon\u2019s arms. You love it when he uses his strength to pin you to the wall, and you also love it when you can feel his arms around you afterwards. Jon loves your ass. He especially loves curling up behind you at night so that he can feel your ass pressing into him.</p><p><b>C = Cum </b>(Anything to do with cum basically\u2026 I\u2019m a disgusting person)<br/>Jon is typically not super into anything too dirty, he doesn\u2019t want to feel like he is demeaning you. However, he does admit that he likes cumming inside of you.\u00a0</p><p><b>D = Dirty Secret</b> (Pretty self explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)<br/>Jon\u2019s dirty secret is that he loves eating you out. He would never admit that to you, but you have figured out after his insistence on doing it so frequently.</p><p><b>E = Experience</b> (How experienced are they? Do they know what they\u2019re doing?)<br/>Jon is rather inexperienced when he first meets you, only sleeping with Ygritte before you. Despite this, he catches on quickly as to just how he should pleasure you.</p><p><b>F = Favorite Position</b> (This goes without saying.)<br/>Jon is rather vanilla, preferring Missionary. He likes to be able to see your face while he is inside you, and he loves the way that you cling to him and claw at his back.</p><p><b>G = Goofy </b>(Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc)<br/>In the moment, Jon is super serious. He views sex as something special and intimate, and treats it as such. However, afterwards he opens up and it a bit sillier. He loves to hear your laugh after sex, it is so carefree.</p><!-- more --><p><b>H = Hair </b>(How well groomed are they, does the carpet match the drapes, etc.)<br/>He doesn\u2019t really do a lot to manscape as you don\u2019t really mind. In Westeros it is not all that common for men to do much\u00a0\u201cdown there\u201d, so Jon doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t expect you to either, letting you choose whether or not you shave.</p><p><b>I = Intimacy</b> (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect\u2026) <br/>Jon is one of the most intimate people when it comes to sex. He treats every time as if it was the first, always being careful and loving. There are a handful of times that he gets rougher with you, typically after any kind of danger such as battles, but in general he is incredibly sweet.</p><p><b>J = Jack Off </b>(Masturbation headcanon)<br/>Jon doesn\u2019t really masturbate. If you are away from each other, he would much rather wait to see you again and feel your hands on his body.</p><p><b>K = Kink </b>(One or more of their kinks)<br/>Jon likes it when you tug on his hair. You don\u2019t have to pull too hard, but he loves the feelings of your hands grabbing at his long locks.</p><p><br/><b>L = Location</b> (Favourite places to do the do)<br/>Jon prefers to\u00a0\u201cdo the do\u201d in the comfort of your own bedroom. He wants to keep all aspects of this part of your relationship entirely private, as he likes keeping you all to himself in that regard. You have had to make do with inns along the road though when traveling, and he had to admit that he did get a bit of a rush from trying to stay quiet.</p><p><b>M = Motivation</b> (What turns them on, gets them going)<br/>You get a mischievous glint in your eyes on occasion when you are beginning to talk dirty to him, and it turns him on like crazy. He also loves it when you call out his name; he likes to know that he is the one who is making you feel so good.</p><p><b>N = NO </b>(Something they wouldn\u2019t do, turn offs)<br/>Jon would never do anything that might hurt you. He will still give you a playful slap on the ass from time to time, as it is his favorite body part, but he wouldn\u2019t spank you unless you really wanted him to. He isn\u2019t really into any kind of BDSM, he wants to treasure you as you are precious to him and he couldn\u2019t even imagine hurting you for pleasure.</p><p><b>O = Oral</b> (Preference in giving or receiving, skill, etc)<br/>Jon prefers eating you out as opposed to a blowjob, as it is his dirty secret after all. He likes to show you how much he loves you. Additionally, he feels like you are being too dirty when you are giving him a blowjob and he doesn\u2019t want you to feel on the same level as a common brothel whore. He still lets you go down on him when you want to, but he definitely prefers to go down on you. He is pretty good at it as well, having a lot of practice with knowing just how you like it.\u00a0</p><p><b>P = Pace</b> (Are they fats and rough? Slow and sensual? etc.)<br/>Jon is almost always sensual. He speeds up as he gets closer to his climax, but he is still gentle with you even as he picks up the pace. After any kind of danger erupts however, he will get rougher as he knows the possibility of losing you has increased. It also helps him burn off stress. Afterwards he always apologizes, but you reassure him that you didn\u2019t mind.</p><p><b>Q = Quickie</b> (Their opinions on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)<br/>He doesn\u2019t like quickies because he would rather cherish you and your body in what he deems\u00a0\u201cthe right way\u201d. However you have had a few times where you needed each other as soon as possible and it came to a quickie.</p><p><b>R = Risk</b> (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)<br/>Jon will experiment if you ask him to, as he always wants to please you. He would never ask to experiment himself though, as he already likes what the two of you do and he would never want to risk hurting you or making you do something that you don\u2019t want to.</p><p><b>S = Stamina</b> (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last\u2026)<br/>Since Job was relatively inexperienced before you, you had assumed that he would not last very long. To your surprise, he can actually go at it for a long time. He needs some time to recuperate, but as soon as he is feeling better he will always be ready for round two. He can\u2019t go more than two rounds though, finding himself exhausted.</p><p><b>T = Toy</b> (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)<br/>Neither Jon or you own any toys. It is just not something that either of you are in to.</p><p><b>U = Unfair</b> (how much they like to tease)<br/>Jon likes to tease you from time to time, whether it be whispering naughty things in your ear in public or making sure you walk in on him changing. You like to tease him even more though, always bending down when you are wearing low cut dresses to show off your cleavage or telling him about all the things you want to do to him that night.</p><p><b>V = Volume</b> (How loud they are, what sounds they make)<br/>Jon isn\u2019t very loud, being more of a low groaner and a grunter. When he does moan, it is long and deep which sends waves of arousal through your body.</p><p><b>W = Wild Card</b> (Get a random headcanon for the character of your choice)<br/>Jon loves to kiss you. Your lips meld together perfectly and you always taste so sweet to him. Jon will even kiss you in public, which is surprising as he is usually a very private person. He just can\u2019t help himself when your lips look so irresistible to him all the time!</p><p><b>X = X-Ray</b> (Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in those pants, picture or words)<br/>Jon is above average size-wise, but nothing too crazy. And he definitely knows how to use it to his advantage.</p><p><b>Y = Yearning</b> (How high is their sex drive?)<br/>Jon has a pretty high sex drive, but he doesn\u2019t let it get the best of him. He only asks when when the time is right, and he would never continue with anything if you told him to stop.</p><p><b>Z = ZZZ</b> (\u2026 how quickly they fall asleep afterwards)\u00a0<br/>Jon takes a while to fall asleep after sex, liking to look at you and how peaceful you look. He likes to talk as well, always telling you just how much he loves you as you snuggle afterwards. If you go for more than one round however, he has a maximum of probably three minutes before he checks out because he is just so exhausted.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Did you enjoy this?

He doesn\u2019t expect you to either, letting you choose whether or not you shave.</p><p><b>I = Intimacy</b> (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect\u2026) <br>Jon is one of the most intimate people when it comes to sex. He treats every time as if it was the first, always being careful and loving. There are a handful of times that he gets rougher with you, typically after any kind of danger such as battles, but in general he is incredibly sweet.</p><p><b>J = Jack Off </b>(Masturbation headcanon)<br>Jon doesn\u2019t really masturbate. If you are away from each other, he would much rather wait to see you again and feel your hands on his body.</p><p><b>K = Kink </b>(One or more of their kinks)<br>Jon likes it when you tug on his hair. You don\u2019t have to pull too hard, but he loves the feelings of your hands grabbing at his long locks.</p><p><br><b>L = Location</b> (Favourite places to do the do)<br>Jon prefers to\u00a0\u201cdo the do\u201d in the comfort of your own bedroom. He wants to keep all aspects of this part of your relationship entirely private, as he likes keeping you all to himself in that regard. You have had to make do with inns along the road though when traveling, and he had to admit that he did get a bit of a rush from trying to stay quiet.</p><p><b>M = Motivation</b> (What turns them on, gets them going)<br>You get a mischievous glint in your eyes on occasion when you are beginning to talk dirty to him, and it turns him on like crazy. He also loves it when you call out his name; he likes to know that he is the one who is making you feel so good.</p><p><b>N = NO </b>(Something they wouldn\u2019t do, turn offs)<br>Jon would never do anything that might hurt you. He will still give you a playful slap on the ass from time to time, as it is his favorite body part, but he wouldn\u2019t spank you unless you really wanted him to. He isn\u2019t really into any kind of BDSM, he wants to treasure you as you are precious to him and he couldn\u2019t even imagine hurting you for pleasure.</p><p><b>O = Oral</b> (Preference in giving or receiving, skill, etc)<br>Jon prefers eating you out as opposed to a blowjob, as it is his dirty secret after all. He likes to show you how much he loves you. Additionally, he feels like you are being too dirty when you are giving him a blowjob and he doesn\u2019t want you to feel on the same level as a common brothel whore. He still lets you go down on him when you want to, but he definitely prefers to go down on you. He is pretty good at it as well, having a lot of practice with knowing just how you like it.\u00a0</p><p><b>P = Pace</b> (Are they fats and rough? Slow and sensual? etc.)<br>Jon is almost always sensual. He speeds up as he gets closer to his climax, but he is still gentle with you even as he picks up the pace. After any kind of danger erupts however, he will get rougher as he knows the possibility of losing you has increased. It also helps him burn off stress. Afterwards he always apologizes, but you reassure him that you didn\u2019t mind.</p><p><b>Q = Quickie</b> (Their opinions on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)<br>He doesn\u2019t like quickies because he would rather cherish you and your body in what he deems\u00a0\u201cthe right way\u201d. However you have had a few times where you needed each other as soon as possible and it came to a quickie.</p><p><b>R = Risk</b> (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)<br>Jon will experiment if you ask him to, as he always wants to please you. He would never ask to experiment himself though, as he already likes what the two of you do and he would never want to risk hurting you or making you do something that you don\u2019t want to.</p><p><b>S = Stamina</b> (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last\u2026)<br>Since Job was relatively inexperienced before you, you had assumed that he would not last very long. To your surprise, he can actually go at it for a long time. He needs some time to recuperate, but as soon as he is feeling better he will always be ready for round two. He can\u2019t go more than two rounds though, finding himself exhausted.</p><p><b>T = Toy</b> (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)<br>Neither Jon or you own any toys. It is just not something that either of you are in to.</p><p><b>U = Unfair</b> (how much they like to tease)<br>Jon likes to tease you from time to time, whether it be whispering naughty things in your ear in public or making sure you walk in on him changing. You like to tease him even more though, always bending down when you are wearing low cut dresses to show off your cleavage or telling him about all the things you want to do to him that night.</p><p><b>V = Volume</b> (How loud they are, what sounds they make)<br>Jon isn\u2019t very loud, being more of a low groaner and a grunter. When he does moan, it is long and deep which sends waves of arousal through your body.</p><p><b>W = Wild Card</b> (Get a random headcanon for the character of your choice)<br>Jon loves to kiss you. Your lips meld together perfectly and you always taste so sweet to him. Jon will even kiss you in public, which is surprising as he is usually a very private person. He just can\u2019t help himself when your lips look so irresistible to him all the time!</p><p><b>X = X-Ray</b> (Let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in those pants, picture or words)<br>Jon is above average size-wise, but nothing too crazy. And he definitely knows how to use it to his advantage.</p><p><b>Y = Yearning</b> (How high is their sex drive?)<br>Jon has a pretty high sex drive, but he doesn\u2019t let it get the best of him. He only asks when when the time is right, and he would never continue with anything if you told him to stop.</p><p><b>Z = ZZZ</b> (\u2026 how quickly they fall asleep afterwards)\u00a0<br>Jon takes a while to fall asleep after sex, liking to look at you and how peaceful you look. He likes to talk as well, always telling you just how much he loves you as you snuggle afterwards. If you go for more than one round however, he has a maximum of probably three minutes before he checks out because he is just so exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Did you enjoy this?

If you go for more than one round however, he has a maximum of probably three minutes before he checks out because he is just so exhausted.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Did you enjoy this?

He also always makes sure that you are feeling okay, cleaning you up if need be and cuddling with you.</p>\n<p><b>B = Body part </b>(Their favorite body part of theirs and also their partner&rsquo;s)<br />You love Jon&rsquo;s arms. You love it when he uses his strength to pin you to the wall, and you also love it when you can feel his arms around you afterwards. Jon loves your ass. He especially loves curling up behind you at night so that he can feel your ass pressing into him.</p>\n<p><b>C = Cum </b>(Anything to do with cum basically&hellip; I&rsquo;m a disgusting person)<br />Jon is typically not super into anything too dirty, he doesn&rsquo;t want to feel like he is demeaning you. However, he does admit that he likes cumming inside of you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>D = Dirty Secret</b> (Pretty self explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)<br />Jon&rsquo;s dirty secret is that he loves eating you out. He would never admit that to you, but you have figured out after his insistence on doing it so frequently.</p>\n<p><b>E = Experience</b> (How experienced are they? Do they know what they&rsquo;re doing?)<br />Jon is rather inexperienced when he first meets you, only sleeping with Ygritte before you. Despite this, he catches on quickly as to just how he should pleasure you.</p>\n<p><b>F = Favorite Position</b> (This goes without saying.)<br />Jon is rather vanilla, preferring Missionary. He likes to be able to see your face while he is inside you, and he loves the way that you cling to him and claw at his back.</p>\n<p><b>G = Goofy </b>(Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc)<br />In the moment, Jon is super serious. He views sex as something special and intimate, and treats it as such. However, afterwards he opens up and it a bit sillier. He loves to hear your laugh after sex, it is so carefree.</p>\n</p>",

                "content": "<p>\n(2) last ep where J/D will be confirmed. They did this to fool certain \nsections of fandom. Like a lot of foreshadowing of other things in the \nshow that went nowhere. Because if it wasn&rsquo;t the case, then they would \nhave stopped with J/S in S8 &amp; showed J/S as only siblings in S8 \n&amp; showed struggle over j b/w S &amp; D as only political. Instead \nthey showed S in love with J even though it was never confirmed. J/D was\n to be like Jaime&rsquo;s ( I knew what she was but loved her anyway) &amp; \nRhaegar/L impossible\n &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>\n3- love that bought death/destruction in realm. In the books J will \nbecome blind to D&rsquo;s faults too( but not like the show where he witnesses\n her being stopped from burning/ power hungry over saving people etc but\n other things that in his eyes will be ignorable) &amp; choose his targ \nside especially after knowing his parentage. He&rsquo;ll be conflicted but \nhe&rsquo;ll choose her &amp; targ restoration coz that&rsquo;s his house. Basically \nhe&rsquo;ll prove himself to be rhaegar&rsquo;s son through &amp; through. S is his \nElia. Him\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>\n4- saying I&rsquo;m not a stark is meant to be taken as truth coz yes he&rsquo;s a \ntarg in actions &amp; blood. By the end, J&rsquo;s priorities have changed. He\n doesn&rsquo;t want children coz the one with whom he wanted with is \ndead/turned out to be his aunt &amp; he doesn&rsquo;t want to be lord of \nwinterfell coz he made his choice by choosing D/betrayed the north &amp;\n can&rsquo;t in any case coz he&rsquo;s a targ who loves S only as a sibling. \nBasically his priorities have changed- he doesn&rsquo;t want north/ wife &amp;\n children by the end. S's&nbsp;\n\n\n <br /></p><p>\n5- priorities will change as well. She&rsquo;ll be put in the same place as \nbook1- b/w a man she&rsquo;s in love with &amp; family/north independence. \nThis time she&rsquo;ll chooses north wholeheartedly. Not just coz J doesn&rsquo;t \nreciprocate her love &amp; chose targ restoration, even if he loved her,\n she&rsquo;ll still choose north. So S by the end will be married to her \njob/kingdom not coz she&rsquo;s pining for J at the wall or is tired of \nwaiting for love etc but coz that&rsquo;s what she wants. Both J &amp; S \npriorities would have changed\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>\n6- changed by the end &amp; they&rsquo;re at peace with it. That&rsquo;s what they \nwant. Cat was right about J. He was rhaegar&rsquo;s son through &amp; through.\n Usurper of her children ending up at the wall dying childless. Finally \nif Jonsa was indeed the main lovestory then why didn&rsquo;t D&amp;D go with \nit? It would have perfect shock value they look for along with pol jon. \nGRRM told them J/D was it &amp; they did it even though execution was \nwrong. No way they will make this up.\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p><p>Dear nonny,</p><p>you are of course entitled to your own opinion and this opinion seems to be that although Sansa might be in love with Jon, she chose the interest of the North, and that Jon was never in love with Sansa, but was in love with Dany, and that their love was doomed like Jaime/Cersei and Rhaegar/Lyanna. And this would mean that both Sansa and Jon are at the very least content with where they end.</p><p>As for Jonerys as a love story: We could probably argue about this until the world ends, but I just can&rsquo;t see love, not from his side. And bad writing and lack of chemistry cannot account for everything. Jon looked miserable with her all the time and if he was in love with her, why did she not believe him in episode 5 and said &ldquo;Let it be fear?&rdquo;. This relationship was written as unbalanced and abusive. I just don&rsquo;t see any love there, from both sides. He never showed love and she was infatuated. If she had loved him, she would not have tried to separate him from his family. I am sure we&rsquo;ll get a Jonerys relationship in the books as well, and it might well be the &ldquo;open&rdquo; affair, that everybody knows about, but I don&rsquo;t think it will be a love story that is in any way fulfilling and I suspect that it won&rsquo;t be a love story in the books.<br /></p><p> Everything up to the finale was ambiguous and open.

I\u2019ve suspected that it will be more of an accident in the books (that is until I saw the finale) and the reason is this: GRRM makes quite a point about the Starks not killing or murdering easily, not without a trial at least. As much as I wanted Ramsay to die, Sansa deliberately feeding him to his dogs, never sat right with me tbh. It is not a \u2018Stark\u2019 thing to do and it does not fit Sansa\u2019s character as she is at the end of AFFC. <br></p><p>Now, I am quite convinced that Sansa will have a narrow escape from Ramsay in the books. I hope GRRM spares her the Ramsay ordeal. We already saw how bad he is with Jeyne in the books, and I think that Sansa\u2019s virginity as the method to get rid of her still-husband Tyrion will be of importance in the books. <br></p><p>I know, I would prefer Ramsay dying in poetic justice because of his own hubris, but my faith in GRRM has been severely shaken by the ending, so I must admit that I am not as certain as I was before. The killing of Ramsay by Jon or Sansa might serve to show them developing a vengeful side. <br></p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br></p>",
