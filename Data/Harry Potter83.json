I don&rsquo;t understand people trying to defend him like &ldquo;oh but he was misunderstood and hurt&rdquo; or some other excuse of the sort. No, I don&rsquo;t care. No matter what you have been through in your life, that doesn&rsquo;t give you a free pass to be an asshole; especially not to children who at that point, need the support and care a teacher should be giving. You don&rsquo;t see Harry hurting, bullying, or tearing people down because he lost his family. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck who you lost or who bullied you, or what was &ldquo;taken from you&rdquo;, taking it out on others is not okay, and nobody should ever be defending this. </p><p>Recently I have been doing a lot of digging into his character via tryna read the books (only on book 2, r.i.p my ability to read) and re-watch the movies, hoping there could be something I could find to defend and be like &ldquo;he actually had a good reason for this&rdquo; but honestly at the end of the day, he really is just a fucked up, greasy, bitter asshole of a character..</p><p>As I said, I like Snape a lot; but this guy is <b><i>severely</i></b> flawed, and there is absolutely no excuse for his shitty behaviour. Yes it is sad he died, and yeah he did protect Harry and do some okay things, but that really does not redeem him because he kept being a dick probably thinking that his good deeds would excuse the bad ones. </p>",
