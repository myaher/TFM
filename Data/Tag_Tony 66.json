He focused on the people gathered, for the first time noticing, that the room was full and even some people were crowding near the walls, not getting a seat. Women in elegant two-piece dresses were listening to Tony with heated cheeks, some of them holding a palm pressed on their chest to calm down their quickly beating hearts. Men in suits, nodding in approval, taking in every word. Everyone seemed in trance and Tony was the hypnotizer. Steve looked back to the stage and at his husband. Of course, that Tony was in the center of attention, always able to grasp everyone&rsquo;s attention. If he ordered everyone to stand up and do five jumping jacks, Steve was sure there won&rsquo;t be a single person who wouldn&rsquo;t listen. His husband was charismatic, charming and incredibly smart. Also, damn handsome, but maybe it wasn&rsquo;t what counted the most here, but was an added bonus. Everyone adored him.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you jealous?&rdquo; Natasha asked in a teasing voice, smiling at the soldier. </p><p>Steve tried to keep his face neutral and his jaw slack.

Their hot, sweat covered bodies pressed to each other, Tony nearly disappearing under Steve&rsquo;s solid, muscled frame. The nail marks on his back healed in minutes, but he could still feel the way Tony had scratched him, trying to last and draw out the pleasure for both of them. The tanned body quivering under him, clenching and unclenching when hot waves of ecstasy went through him. His name being moaned out over and over again, nearly screamed out when the pleasure blinded him, and then small, blissful whispers, and tremble of the exhausted body.</p><p><i>'Mhhmm\u2026 Steve\u2026&rsquo;</i></p><p>Mouth on mouth, they kissed, long and needing, Steve still gently rocking his hips into Tony with a wonderful, wet sound, just to be together for a bit more. </p><p><i>'Ahhh\u2026 Ahhh\u2026&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Steve\u2026 Steve!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; Steve yelped, when an elbow was slammed into his ribs, and Sam almost fell out of his chair because of the ruckus.

He focused on the people gathered, for the first time noticing, that the room was full and even some people were crowding near the walls, not getting a seat. Women in elegant two-piece dresses were listening to Tony with heated cheeks, some of them holding a palm pressed on their chest to calm down their quickly beating hearts. Men in suits, nodding in approval, taking in every word. Everyone seemed in trance and Tony was the hypnotizer. Steve looked back to the stage and at his husband. Of course, that Tony was in the center of attention, always able to grasp everyone\u2019s attention. If he ordered everyone to stand up and do five jumping jacks, Steve was sure there won\u2019t be a single person who wouldn\u2019t listen. His husband was charismatic, charming and incredibly smart. Also, damn handsome, but maybe it wasn\u2019t what counted the most here, but was an added bonus.

Their hot, sweat covered bodies pressed to each other, Tony nearly disappearing under Steve\u2019s solid, muscled frame. The nail marks on his back healed in minutes, but he could still feel the way Tony had scratched him, trying to last and draw out the pleasure for both of them. The tanned body quivering under him, clenching and unclenching when hot waves of ecstasy went through him. His name being moaned out over and over again, nearly screamed out when the pleasure blinded him, and then small, blissful whispers, and tremble of the exhausted body.</p><p><i>'Mhhmm\u2026 Steve\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>Mouth on mouth, they kissed, long and needing, Steve still gently rocking his hips into Tony with a wonderful, wet sound, just to be together for a bit more. </p><p><i>'Ahhh\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cSteve\u2026 Steve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmph!\u201d Steve yelped, when an elbow was slammed into his ribs, and Sam almost fell out of his chair because of the ruckus.
