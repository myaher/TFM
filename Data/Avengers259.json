He was standing at your locker as always, laughing at something Ned said to him. &nbsp;You desperately wanted to smile, but all you felt was numb, completely and utterly numb. </p><p>His eyes caught yours, his demeanour faltering when he saw your tired eyes and sluggish posture. You sent him a small glance, opening up your locker as he and Ned peered over puzzled. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo; Peter asked quietly.</p><p>You hummed softly in response, refusing to look him the eye in fear that you might start bawling on the spot. </p><p>He could cut the tension with a knife. It radiated between the both of you, almost too much to handle.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you feeling okay?&rdquo; he questioned innocently. </p><p>You nod without a word, shut your locker as the bell rang loudly. Students sent out like a stampede towards their classes and suddenly you were happy about this chaos. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll uh, see you during Chemistry,&rdquo; you mutter before speeding off into the cluster of students. </p><p>The boys look at each other with confusion in their eyes. Ned shrugs and Peter stares back at your figure disappearing into the crowd</p><p>-</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t see Peter at Chemistry. </p><p>Somehow the thought made you sick to your stomach that during English you raced off to the nurse. You blamed it on nerves, letting you go home with a sad smile. </p><p>You just couldn&rsquo;t handle it, seeing lovable, kind-hearted Peter Parker look at you with those honey speckled eyes. If you did, you knew you would forget why you were upset. </p><p>So now, you laid back on your bed with the back of your head buried into your pillow and eyes flicked up at the blank ceiling. </p><p>A small knock on your bedroom door brought you back into reality. Sitting up, you slip off of your bed and head towards your door, hand coming out to grasp your door handle. </p><p>You are met with a set of chocolate curls and wary eyes, almost slamming the door on his face, but you refrain. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he speaks softly, eyes roaming your small frame drowning in a large sweatshirt. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; you respond timidly.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod, stepping out of the way and sitting back onto your bed as he closes the door behind you. </p><p>He stands up in front of you, gazing down as you look away from his intense gaze. </p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not genuinely sick, there&rsquo;s no way you would miss out on English,&rdquo; he nearly laughs.</p><p>You remain silent, he knew you all too well. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so withdrawn lately, what&rsquo;s going on with you?&rdquo; he questions with desperation laced in his tone. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help the harsh laugh that fell from your lips, shaking your head as the sound made his head snap up swiftly.</p><p>&ldquo;What is my favourite colour?&rdquo; you urge. &nbsp;</p><p>He opens his mouth to answer but the words seem to be caught up in his throat. &nbsp;He is rendered speechless, a bitter smile graces your lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Who even are you Peter?&rdquo; you scoff, standing up abruptly from your spot of the bed in front of him. </p><p>His mouth is dry, staring back at you with his tongue tied. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hardly around anymore! One minute your promising me that you&rsquo;ll always be there and then you&rsquo;re disappearing off to god knows where,&rdquo; you exclaim.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I try so hard to be there for you all the time. But this can&rsquo;t just be all me, so if you&rsquo;re going to keep doing this then I can&rsquo;t let this go on any longer,&rdquo; you motion between the both of you making his eyes widen slightly. &nbsp;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes glass over, unable to figure out what to say or do. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</p><p>Your breathing slows, looking back at his sad eyes in confusion. </p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so scared that I&rsquo;ll get too attached to you and you&rsquo;ll be gone, like Ben and my parents. I&rsquo;ve been trying so damn hard to push you away and pretend I don&rsquo;t love you when I do, so much,&rdquo; he confesses. </p><p>Your firm posture softens as the words escape his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m so sorry, I&rsquo;ve been so selfish and disregarding how you may feel-&rdquo; you cut him off with your lips softly pressing against his.</p><p>He melts into your touch, arms wrapping around your torso in desperation. &nbsp;</p><p>You pull away slowly, eyes connecting with his. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to lose me, Peter, I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>He sniffles slightly, looking back at you with such adoration. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he whispers, pecking your lips lightly again, </p><p>Peter Parker, lovable, kind-hearted Peter Parker deserved the world. </p>",

Everyone was worried about their friends but they knew that the strongest Avengers would be fine without them.</p><p>The Avengers were never not busy, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always some bad guy to stop,&rdquo; Captain would say. But these days were quite almost too quiet for Tony&rsquo;s liking he suspected something was up and waited for something bad to happen.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe the bad guys decided to take a vacation, Tony! Chill out man,&rdquo; Sam said sipping on a beer. &ldquo;Go skydiving \u00a0or take Pepper out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As long as he isn&rsquo;t bugging us all the time with false alarms I don&rsquo;t care what he does,&rdquo; Natasha rolled her eyes recalling how crazy Tony was turning out to be.</p><p>Tony tried to hide his anxiety and PTSD from everyone and pretended to be fine but everyone could see it. The feeling of something bad happening was eating him alive.</p><p>&ldquo;You all say that but look, JARVIS show them &lsquo;the super secret project&rsquo; please,&rdquo; Tony dropped down on a couch and propped his feet on a table.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Just see for yourself,&ldquo; He mumbled as he swallowed a peg of scotch.</p><p>&quot;As you wish sir,&rdquo; JARVIS&rsquo; voice echoed through the room as a projection began.</p><p>All the avengers settled in for the show. Although they were wary of Tony&rsquo;s ideas after Ultron but they stayed because they were all secretly bored and were itching to do some ass kicking.</p><p>&ldquo;You see something suspicious in the picture?&rdquo; Tony pointed out to the projection which seemed like a normal day in Brooklyn.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, where are you going with this?&rdquo; Rhodey asked narrowing his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Just watch. Jarvis, zoom in please.&rdquo; Tony pointed towards the image and pointed grimly. Invisible to the naked eye was a small red dot and upon further zooming, it looked like a man who was in the air presumably flying but his actions mimicked swinging.&ldquo; that kid right there is our guy,&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Does he have any powers?&rdquo; Natasha asked Tony subconsciously leaning forward. Everyone was now interested, giving Tony their complete attention. Tony smirked internally yelling I told you so.</p><p>&ldquo;His parlour tricks are pretty neat. He shoots webs, has super strength. Probably has enhanced senses too,&rdquo; Tony explained flailing his arms around. A clear sign that he&rsquo;s drunk.</p><p>&ldquo;So what he&rsquo;s a mutant?&rdquo; Steve asks sobering up from the mead Thor brought from Asgard. The only reply he got was a non-committal grunt</p><p>&ldquo;And why are you showing this to us? Are we recruiting him?&rdquo; Natasha asks.</p><p>&ldquo;No, the reason I&rsquo;m showing you this spider boy is because he&rsquo;s the next Darth Vader, Jarvis start the slideshow,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Tony he is literally saving a puppy from being run over by a food truck,&rdquo; Natasha frowned at the video of Web pulling a golden retriever pup away from its imminent death.</p><p>&ldquo;wait until you see the next one,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now he&rsquo;s bringing a kitten down a tree, tony are you sure he&rsquo;s our guy?&rdquo; Rhodey questioned him quirking an eyebrow at him.</p><p>&ldquo;And now he&rsquo;s helping an old lady cross a street, Tony this guy looks like a poster child of superheroes, just let it be. You wasted enough time of ours already,&rdquo; Clint groaned as he had enough of waiting for something to happen in the future and missing the now. </p><p>He shuddered as he remembered that he promised his kids to go out for dinner after watching their favourite Disney movie that they already watched five times in this week, but it looks like dinner has to wait.</p><p>&ldquo;I see that our guests are getting bored. Jarvis,\u00a0pull out his portfolio,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Peter Benjamin Parker\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b>Age</b>: 16\u00a0</p><p><b>Relationship</b>: single\u00a0</p><p><b>Guardian(s):</b> May Parker, Benjamin Parker (deceased)\u00a0</p><p><b>Occupation: </b>Student, Intern at Stark Internship\u00a0</p><p><b>Residence</b>:&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right that&rsquo;s enough. That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m out, I&rsquo;m not going to be in a plan to terrorise a poor kid. Good night everyone,&rdquo; Clint was out of the door before anyone could say anything. Clint&rsquo;s departure made the group look amongst themselves. Silently communicating who&rsquo;s going to pull Tony out of his funk.</p><p>The Captain sighed before he began. </p><p>&ldquo;look, Tony&hellip; I know that you think that the whole Ultron thing was your fault, okay it kinda is but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can harass a kid,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not to mention stalk the said16-year-old,&rdquo; Natasha added dryly as she got up dusting Cheeto dust off her dust and made her way to the door.</p><p>Tony cursed before he said,</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Wait, Widow! You might want to see this. JARVIS tell them about the girlfriend,&ldquo; Tony waved his hands in the air as Natasha sighed and sat beside Cap exchanging a look that said <i>'if he gets any crazier I&rsquo;m killing him&rsquo;</i></p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Jarvis showed your pictures, your details and your last seen whereabouts. The latest update on your story was that there were no updates. In a recent interview, your parents publicly broke down in front of the cameras begging for someone to come forward and say something and for someone to save their daughter.\u00a0</p><p>The slide show ended with a picture of you and Peter. You were hugging Peter from the behind and gave the camera a huge smile, your eyes twinkling with happiness. In the next picture, you were kissing Peter&rsquo;s cheek his grin so wide that it occupied his entire face.</p><p>&quot;She&rsquo;s so beautiful,&rdquo; said Pepper, who hasn&rsquo;t spoken a word the entire evening. These days Pepper stayed quiet silently observing as her now Fianc\u00e9 drove himself crazy with all the insufferable scenarios and wild predictions of the future.</p><p>&ldquo;She is and she&rsquo;s missing. There were no traces left by her. The last time she was heard of was when she left a voice mail to her the then boyfriend to break-up with him because he was acting suspiciously. And guess who goes missing immediately after. BINGO! Her,&rdquo;</p><p>Although it was truly a heartbreaking incident it wasn&rsquo;t their line of field. They handled aliens and Nazis, not missing teenage girls and Natasha voiced this concern.</p><p>&ldquo;So? A girl goes missing and you decided to go Nancy Drew on her? Maybe she just ran away. Her heart was broken and she wanted some space,&rdquo; Natasha suggested making her voice soft to cushion the harsh words she spoke. The words seemingly Dismissing the girl&rsquo;s disappearance and the grief of her family.</p><p>&ldquo;She disappeared without any trace Romanoff, do you really believe a teenage girl who ran away because of a high school boyfriend is smart enough to disappear without any paper trail and without any digital trace as well?&rdquo; Natasha grew quiet as she contemplated Tony&rsquo;s words. He was right.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;So what? You think she&rsquo;s involved in some organisation? Even so, why her?&rdquo; Captain frowned as he tried to make sense of the situation, it wasn&rsquo;t a difficult case but it was a little suspicious.</p><p>&ldquo;There are Countless conspiracy theories online ranging from a foreign boyfriend to alien abduction.

Her heart was broken and she wanted some space,\u201d Natasha suggested making her voice soft to cushion the harsh words she spoke. The words seemingly Dismissing the girl\u2019s disappearance and the grief of her family.</p><p>\u201cShe disappeared without any trace Romanoff, do you really believe a teenage girl who ran away because of a high school boyfriend is smart enough to disappear without any paper trail and without any digital trace as well?\u201d Natasha grew quiet as she contemplated Tony\u2019s words. He was right.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what? You think she\u2019s involved in some organisation? Even so, why her?\u201d Captain frowned as he tried to make sense of the situation, it wasn\u2019t a difficult case but it was a little suspicious.</p><p>\u201cThere are Countless conspiracy theories online ranging from a foreign boyfriend to alien abduction.

Ultron?\u201d Tony asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d Pepper replied rolling her eyes and narrowing her eyes at her fianc\u00e9 confused as to why he started talking about a drastically different topic.</p><p>\u201cWell has anyone of us wondered what happened to the mess we left behind?

Everyone was worried about their friends but they knew that the strongest Avengers would be fine without them.</p><p>The Avengers were never not busy, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always some bad guy to stop,&rdquo; Captain would say. But these days were quite almost too quiet for Tony&rsquo;s liking he suspected something was up and waited for something bad to happen.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe the bad guys decided to take a vacation, Tony! Chill out man,&rdquo; Sam said sipping on a beer. &ldquo;Go skydiving &nbsp;or take Pepper out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As long as he isn&rsquo;t bugging us all the time with false alarms I don&rsquo;t care what he does,&rdquo; Natasha rolled her eyes recalling how crazy Tony was turning out to be.</p><p>Tony tried to hide his anxiety and PTSD from everyone and pretended to be fine but everyone could see it. The feeling of something bad happening was eating him alive.</p><p>&ldquo;You all say that but look, JARVIS show them &lsquo;the super secret project&rsquo; please,&rdquo; Tony dropped down on a couch and propped his feet on a table.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Just see for yourself,&ldquo; He mumbled as he swallowed a peg of scotch.</p><p>\"As you wish sir,&rdquo; JARVIS&rsquo; voice echoed through the room as a projection began.</p><p>All the avengers settled in for the show. Although they were wary of Tony&rsquo;s ideas after Ultron but they stayed because they were all secretly bored and were itching to do some ass kicking.</p><p>&ldquo;You see something suspicious in the picture?&rdquo; Tony pointed out to the projection which seemed like a normal day in Brooklyn.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, where are you going with this?&rdquo; Rhodey asked narrowing his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Just watch. Jarvis, zoom in please.&rdquo; Tony pointed towards the image and pointed grimly. Invisible to the naked eye was a small red dot and upon further zooming, it looked like a man who was in the air presumably flying but his actions mimicked swinging.&ldquo; that kid right there is our guy,\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Does he have any powers?&rdquo; Natasha asked Tony subconsciously leaning forward. Everyone was now interested, giving Tony their complete attention. Tony smirked internally yelling I told you so.</p><p>&ldquo;His parlour tricks are pretty neat. He shoots webs, has super strength. Probably has enhanced senses too,&rdquo; Tony explained flailing his arms around. A clear sign that he&rsquo;s drunk.</p><p>&ldquo;So what he&rsquo;s a mutant?&rdquo; Steve asks sobering up from the mead Thor brought from Asgard. The only reply he got was a non-committal grunt</p><p>&ldquo;And why are you showing this to us? Are we recruiting him?&rdquo; Natasha asks.</p><p>&ldquo;No, the reason I&rsquo;m showing you this spider boy is because he&rsquo;s the next Darth Vader, Jarvis start the slideshow,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Tony he is literally saving a puppy from being run over by a food truck,&rdquo; Natasha frowned at the video of Web pulling a golden retriever pup away from its imminent death.</p><p>&ldquo;wait until you see the next one,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now he&rsquo;s bringing a kitten down a tree, tony are you sure he&rsquo;s our guy?&rdquo; Rhodey questioned him quirking an eyebrow at him.</p><p>&ldquo;And now he&rsquo;s helping an old lady cross a street, Tony this guy looks like a poster child of superheroes, just let it be. You wasted enough time of ours already,&rdquo; Clint groaned as he had enough of waiting for something to happen in the future and missing the now. </p><p>He shuddered as he remembered that he promised his kids to go out for dinner after watching their favourite Disney movie that they already watched five times in this week, but it looks like dinner has to wait.</p><p>&ldquo;I see that our guests are getting bored. Jarvis,&nbsp;pull out his portfolio,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Peter Benjamin Parker&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b>Age</b>: 16&nbsp;</p><p><b>Relationship</b>: single&nbsp;</p><p><b>Guardian(s):</b> May Parker, Benjamin Parker (deceased)&nbsp;</p><p><b>Occupation: </b>Student, Intern at Stark Internship&nbsp;</p><p><b>Residence</b>:&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right that&rsquo;s enough. That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m out, I&rsquo;m not going to be in a plan to terrorise a poor kid. Good night everyone,&rdquo; Clint was out of the door before anyone could say anything. Clint&rsquo;s departure made the group look amongst themselves. Silently communicating who&rsquo;s going to pull Tony out of his funk.</p><p>The Captain sighed before he began. </p><p>&ldquo;look, Tony&hellip; I know that you think that the whole Ultron thing was your fault, okay it kinda is but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can harass a kid,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not to mention stalk the said16-year-old,&rdquo; Natasha added dryly as she got up dusting Cheeto dust off her dust and made her way to the door.</p><p>Tony cursed before he said,</p><p>&nbsp;\"Wait, Widow! You might want to see this. JARVIS tell them about the girlfriend,&ldquo; Tony waved his hands in the air as Natasha sighed and sat beside Cap exchanging a look that said <i>'if he gets any crazier I&rsquo;m killing him&rsquo;</i></p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Jarvis showed your pictures, your details and your last seen whereabouts. The latest update on your story was that there were no updates. In a recent interview, your parents publicly broke down in front of the cameras begging for someone to come forward and say something and for someone to save their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>The slide show ended with a picture of you and Peter. You were hugging Peter from the behind and gave the camera a huge smile, your eyes twinkling with happiness. In the next picture, you were kissing Peter&rsquo;s cheek his grin so wide that it occupied his entire face.</p><p>\"She&rsquo;s so beautiful,&rdquo; said Pepper, who hasn&rsquo;t spoken a word the entire evening. These days Pepper stayed quiet silently observing as her now Fianc&eacute; drove himself crazy with all the insufferable scenarios and wild predictions of the future.</p><p>&ldquo;She is and she&rsquo;s missing. There were no traces left by her. The last time she was heard of was when she left a voice mail to her the then boyfriend to break-up with him because he was acting suspiciously. And guess who goes missing immediately after. BINGO! Her,&rdquo;</p><p>Although it was truly a heartbreaking incident it wasn&rsquo;t their line of field. They handled aliens and Nazis, not missing teenage girls and Natasha voiced this concern.</p><p>&ldquo;So? A girl goes missing and you decided to go Nancy Drew on her? Maybe she just ran away.
