She asked that these families not be able to continue enjoying all their privileges as if nothing had happened. These families are composed of mothers, fathers, wives, sisters, brothers, daughters and sons of fallen soldiers and lords. It is impossible to say that no one has a grievance against Jon or whether they have not supported theirs in their betrayal. What message does it give to let them continue to live quietly at home? That any man can take the risk of betraying because, at worst, he will be the only one to die and his family will be able to continue living quietly in their castle? It must be shown that treason has serious consequences for those who commit it and their families. Being too lenient, they are betrayed like Ned and Robb. However, I do not say that this is the right solution. I\u2019m just saying that there\u2019s a real logic in what Sansa says and that Jon\u2019s way of refusing her opinion and being outraged by that while arguing with his sister is not right either.</p><p>We have two problems here. Sansa is at home, is a lady and sister of the king. She has the right to speak. However, she still has to learn to challenge her brother\u2019s opinion more subtly, to compromise and to find her own way to rule without relying only on what she saw and learned in the South. For his part, Jon is the king and has his vision of things. But he must learn to accept the advice of his sister, to listen to it and to respect it.<br/>They both need to be legitimized. Jon, being a bastard and not winning the battle of Winterfell, doesn\u2019t feel confident in this new role. He needs his sister to support him at all costs. Sansa, with her traumatic past, needs to be in power, to participate at decisions, to be loved and recognized. She needs her brother to support her and recognize her as a counselor. It\u2019s not exactly a war of power. It\u2019s two people who love each other, who depend too much one other, care a great deal about how they think of each other but have two different characters, opinions and desires. Therefore, as long as they can not fully accept each other for what they are, there will be problems.</p><p>This is perfectly symbolized during the second episode. Jon speaks privately with his sister and Ser Davos about Tyrion\u2019s letter. Sansa &amp; Davos give their opinion, Jon listens to them and leaves to think. Then, he receives another letter, makes his decision alone and announce it in front of everyone. And there, unlike the argue of the first episode where no one understands the other, this dispute allows them to understand each other and shows that they are starting to move in the right direction. <br/></p><p>Jon knows he\u2019s at fault by not talking to his sister first, so when he announces he\u2019s going to meet Daenerys, he turns to her like the private conversation they should have had. It is clear that, unlike before, Jon is not irritated that Sansa gives her opinion and opposes him. On the contrary, he is sorry to announce her the new at the same time as everyone else, sorry that she doesn\u2019t understand why he has to leave. His tone is much more warm and desperate to be understood. As for Sansa, she does not give a contrary opinion or get angry after him. On the contrary, she is also desperate to make him understand her point of view, to try to reason with him. She understands that someone has to go but does not want her brother to go. Everything she says to him is right and Jon is aware of it. In addition, this conversation is no longer about the opinions of 2 rulers but more for Jon\u2019s safety, which shows the love of this siblings: Sansa is afraid to lose him, afraid to be left alone behind and Jon is aware of what she feels. He does not want to leave her but has no choice. Finally, by designating her as regent rather than an older and experienced lord, Jon shows his sister that he understood what she said to him, that he listens to her opinion and relies on her judgment. Sansa, though frightened by the responsibility and the idea of \u200b\u200bbeing alone, is as grateful that her brother finally recognizes her. They each accept the other.</p><p>The conclusion of all this is that Jon &amp; Sansa are not perfect and their relationship is not perfect either. However, it is undeniable that each has become the most important person in the eyes of the other. They love, respect and trust each other. They have grown and their relationship had changed. They learned from their mistakes and learned to listen one other.</p><p>Now, it is inconceivable that Sansa betray her brother. She has nothing left. The only thing she has left is her house and family. Except that Bran and Arya have become very strange and, even if she loves them, Sansa will never be as comfortable, fulfilling and happy with them as she is with Jon. The relationship she has built with him is the strongest. She can not deal without him. She needs to be loved and recognized. The recognition she has it as regent and Lady Stark. But love, she has it only weakly with Bran &amp; Arya. Only Jon remains. I have no doubt that their relationship and teamwork will grow stronger and that they can really make a winning team.</p><p><br/></p><p>\nPart 1 here : <a href=\"http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179955800366/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray?is_related_post=1\">http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179955800366/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray?is_related_post=1</a>\n\n<br/></p><p>\nPart 2 here : <a href=\"http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179956068666/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray\">http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179956068666/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray</a>\n\n<br/></p>",

Sansa is at home, is a lady and sister of the king. She has the right to speak. However, she still has to learn to challenge her brother\u2019s opinion more subtly, to compromise and to find her own way to rule without relying only on what she saw and learned in the South. For his part, Jon is the king and has his vision of things. But he must learn to accept the advice of his sister, to listen to it and to respect it.<br>They both need to be legitimized. Jon, being a bastard and not winning the battle of Winterfell, doesn\u2019t feel confident in this new role. He needs his sister to support him at all costs. Sansa, with her traumatic past, needs to be in power, to participate at decisions, to be loved and recognized. She needs her brother to support her and recognize her as a counselor. It\u2019s not exactly a war of power. It\u2019s two people who love each other, who depend too much one other, care a great deal about how they think of each other but have two different characters, opinions and desires. Therefore, as long as they can not fully accept each other for what they are, there will be problems.</p><p>This is perfectly symbolized during the second episode. Jon speaks privately with his sister and Ser Davos about Tyrion\u2019s letter. Sansa &amp; Davos give their opinion, Jon listens to them and leaves to think. Then, he receives another letter, makes his decision alone and announce it in front of everyone. And there, unlike the argue of the first episode where no one understands the other, this dispute allows them to understand each other and shows that they are starting to move in the right direction. <br></p><p>Jon knows he\u2019s at fault by not talking to his sister first, so when he announces he\u2019s going to meet Daenerys, he turns to her like the private conversation they should have had. It is clear that, unlike before, Jon is not irritated that Sansa gives her opinion and opposes him. On the contrary, he is sorry to announce her the new at the same time as everyone else, sorry that she doesn\u2019t understand why he has to leave. His tone is much more warm and desperate to be understood. As for Sansa, she does not give a contrary opinion or get angry after him. On the contrary, she is also desperate to make him understand her point of view, to try to reason with him. She understands that someone has to go but does not want her brother to go. Everything she says to him is right and Jon is aware of it. In addition, this conversation is no longer about the opinions of 2 rulers but more for Jon\u2019s safety, which shows the love of this siblings: Sansa is afraid to lose him, afraid to be left alone behind and Jon is aware of what she feels. He does not want to leave her but has no choice. Finally, by designating her as regent rather than an older and experienced lord, Jon shows his sister that he understood what she said to him, that he listens to her opinion and relies on her judgment. Sansa, though frightened by the responsibility and the idea of \u200b\u200bbeing alone, is as grateful that her brother finally recognizes her. They each accept the other.</p><p>The conclusion of all this is that Jon &amp; Sansa are not perfect and their relationship is not perfect either. However, it is undeniable that each has become the most important person in the eyes of the other. They love, respect and trust each other. They have grown and their relationship had changed. They learned from their mistakes and learned to listen one other.</p><p>Now, it is inconceivable that Sansa betray her brother. She has nothing left. The only thing she has left is her house and family. Except that Bran and Arya have become very strange and, even if she loves them, Sansa will never be as comfortable, fulfilling and happy with them as she is with Jon. The relationship she has built with him is the strongest. She can not deal without him. She needs to be loved and recognized. The recognition she has it as regent and Lady Stark. But love, she has it only weakly with Bran &amp; Arya. Only Jon remains. I have no doubt that their relationship and teamwork will grow stronger and that they can really make a winning team.</p><p><br></p><p>\nPart 1 here : <a href=\"http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179955800366/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray?is_related_post=1\">http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179955800366/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray?is_related_post=1</a>\n\n<br></p><p>\nPart 2 here : <a href=\"http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179956068666/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray\">http://mimi0108.tumblr.com/post/179956068666/jon-x-sansa-why-she-doesnt-and-will-not-betray</a>\n\n<br></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Why, in my \nopinion, the idea that Sansa betrays her brother shows the \nincomprehension of her character and the relationship she develops with \nher brother\n\n</b><br /></p><p>Since the release of the HBO trailer and the first \npictures of the reunion between Jon &amp; Sansa, I read a lot of \nnonsense like &ldquo;Sansa will betray&rdquo;. Again ? It&rsquo;s been 2 seasons that \npeople are in loop on this subject, 2 seasons where it does not happen. \nThis will certainly not happen in the end.</p><p>So, I wanted to make a \npost on my vision of the Sansa character in the S6 and 7, as well as her\n relationship with her brother (since it is him she is supposed to \nbetray).</p><p><b>Part 3 :\nPower and difficulty.\n\n</b></p><p>As for season 7, things have changed. Sansa &amp; Jon are now fully trust on each other and have no more big secrets between them. Sansa, as Lady Stark, stands beside her brother like Ser Davos. <br /></p><p>However, new problems come into play.<br />Sansa, after all these years of being humiliated and forced to shut up, takes a liking to her independence and power. She is finally emancipated and has a place next to the king. However, she has trouble finding her place with Jon. He still sees her as a little sister whom he has to protect and he finds difficult to accept her &ldquo;advice&rdquo; or &ldquo;divergent opinions&rdquo;. <br /></p><p>We see this from the beginning when Lord Royce asks to shave the castles of the Omble and Karstark. Sansa, as Lady of Winterfell, allows herself to intervene and temper his words. The castles must be kept but the families of the traitors will have to move and their properties given to more loyal subjects.<br />This moment is very important. Sansa has the right to speak. Lord Royce has proposed something, she allows herself to show her disagreement and to propose something else. It&rsquo;s her right. No one in the assembly, nor even Davos, seems shocked by her speech. <br /></p><p>Nobody except Jon. This one seems shocked that Sansa speaks, then irritated. He replies more drily than he should. He doen&rsquo;t want to chase families for the fault of some. Then comes an argue that is growing in magnitude (as shown by the final silence) and should be held in private. Yes, Sansa should have been more tactful in her way of replying to her brother. But Jon should have been, from the beginning, more respectful towards her. The wrongs are shared and are initiated by the attitude of Jon. He seems to have a hard time accepting that his sister expresses her opinion. Opinion which, by the way, is not bad. Just like Jon&rsquo;s.</p><p>Contrary to the nonsense I&rsquo;ve heard, Sansa has never asked that the families of traitors be executed. She asked that these families not be able to continue enjoying all their privileges as if nothing had happened. These families are composed of mothers, fathers, wives, sisters, brothers, daughters and sons of fallen soldiers and lords. It is impossible to say that no one has a grievance against Jon or whether they have not supported theirs in their betrayal. What message does it give to let them continue to live quietly at home? That any man can take the risk of betraying because, at worst, he will be the only one to die and his family will be able to continue living quietly in their castle? It must be shown that treason has serious consequences for those who commit it and their families. Being too lenient, they are betrayed like Ned and Robb. However, I do not say that this is the right solution. I&rsquo;m just saying that there&rsquo;s a real logic in what Sansa says and that Jon&rsquo;s way of refusing her opinion and being outraged by that while arguing with his sister is not right either.</p><p>We have two problems here.
