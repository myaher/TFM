Tumblr isn&rsquo;t tagging my post if I use any links!</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to tell you this, but -\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N was trying to stuff few of her books in her bag when Jake spoke.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Y/N didn\u2019t look up at him, she was too busy with her books and her bag.</p><p>\u201cStay away from Harry.\u201d</p><p>Y/N came to an halt hearing that.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she was confused really, why was her uncle saying that, all of a sudden. She clearly remembered the \u2018she\u2019s off limit\u2019 thing he said to Harry, but Jake also knew she didn\u2019t really like him</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about,\u201d she returned to zip her bag full of books. She was pretty sure her shoulder would be sore for carrying it but she had to return those books to the college library by that day.</p><p>\u201cHarry, he- just stay away from him,\u201d Jake said again.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I mean isn\u2019t he \u2018such a nice guy\u2019,\u201d Y/N said nonchalantly, not bothering to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cHe is but, you know - there\u2019s media involved, and his fans can be pretty aggressive and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work out. I mean he\u2019s good guy but I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt ag-\u201d Jake rambled on but Y/N quickly cut him off.</p><p>\u201cOkay, calm down,\u201d she hung the bag on her back and let out a groan. It was heavier than she thought it\u2019d be.\u201cI\u2019m really not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the &lsquo;nice guy\u2019, anyway?\u201d She made her way towards the door</p><p>\u201cHe had work in his studio.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded, but she truly didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d she called.</p><p>She heard Jake and Clare both call back from inside the house before she shut the door.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cEnough already!\u201d Y/N\u2019s best friend, Emilia exclaimed but her voice was just audible for Y/N to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N asked clearly clueless as she flipped few pages of the new book she just took from the library shelf.</p><p>\u201cAll you do is read, can you not take a break?\u201d Emilia huffed, poking on the new thousand pages book - just about the evolution of architectures over time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fun,\u201d Emilia paused. \u201cBut, I can show you what real fun is\u2026\u201d</p><p>However, Emilia didn\u2019t have to speak further for making Y/N understand what she was suggesting.</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m not going,\u201d she said dismissively.</p><p>\u201cOh c'mon!\u201d Emilia pleaded. \u201cIt won\u2019t be for too long! We\u2019ll drop you off by midnight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Emilia. I\u2019m nothing going,\u201d Y/N scrolled through her book trying to take in all the subjects and architecture monuments it talked about. \u201cAnd you said in a way, it almost sounded as if your suggesting something\u2026\u201d</p><p>Emilia didn\u2019t reply to that or said anything at all for a while. Y/N almost thought she gave up but was she wrong.</p><p>\u201cTom!\u201d she yelled making everyone in the library look at her with wide eyes, including Y/N and except Tom. He had a pair of headphones on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Y/N whispered yelled as she looked at Mrs. Valenta the librarian across the room strolling towards them. Emilia didn\u2019t bother to reply. She just got up and pulled Y/N up with her. This made Mrs. Valenta stop on her way and, look at them skeptically.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Y/N exclaimed pulling her hand away from Emilia\u2019s and grabbing her bag, closing the book on the process. Y/N thought they were leaving but surely Emilia had different plans.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a little crush on him!\u201d she whispered with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N said dumb founded, her heart beat rising slightly - <i>how could she have known?</i></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act stupid, I saw how you look at him,\u201d Emilia let out a chuckle.</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes, \u201cyeah right!\u201d Even though Y/N was pretty sure that she didn\u2019t look at him any differently, she was still a little scared. She didn\u2019t want him or anyone to know about this.</p><p>Y/N looked up at Mrs. Valenta who had gone back to her sit, thinking they were leaving. Y/N thought that too but that was until Emilia dragged Y/N to where Tom was sitting the she was about to walk out of the room. However, if Y/N was honest she was kindof expecting this.</p><p>\u201cHola,\u201d Emilia patted Tom\u2019s back as she sat next to him, almost startling him. Y/N walked around the table and took the sit across them.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said to both of them, of course a little confused.</p><p>\u201cSo, I heard you\u2019re going to the party Lilly\u2019s having tonight?\u201d Emilia asked him making Y/N roll her eyes.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah\u2026.?\u201d Tom said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was trying to get Y/N come with me, but she wouldn\u2019t come,\u201d she paused. \u201cSo, I was hoping you\u2019d help me out here. I mean both of you love books, but Y/N look - even he likes to go to party every now and then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to go either, Lucas -he\u2019s sorta forcing me.\u201d</p><p>This made Emilia\u2019s face palm and Y/N giggle. However, Tom quickly added looking at Y/N with a smile, \u201cbut you can come you know, I\u2019ll find someone to hangout with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll come,\u201d Y/N said. Still smiling slightly she got up from her chair.</p><p>\u201cC'mon, Y/N one party,\u201d Emilia insisted but Y/N pressed her lips together and shook her head. Nevertheless it was enough for Emilia to shut up.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d Y/N said happily as she entered the house and closed the door behind her.</p><p>It was almost 9 pm when she returned. Both her uncle and aunt were cuddled up on the couch, binge watching some tv shows. Ice Cream was peacefully snoozing on the floor- however she woke up just the second she heard Y/N\u2019s voice.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s college had ended a long time ago but she decided to go to a coffee shop to finish an assignment that she had. Or maybe she just didn\u2019t want to see Harry\u2019s face or be in his presence at all -everything about him annoyed her, even thinking about him for a split second made her scrunch her nose in annoyance. Y/N knew she shouldn\u2019t be this judgmental as she met him just the night before and for couple of minutes only. But she couldn\u2019t help herself, something about him just made her not like him.</p><p>As Y/N expected she hadn\u2019t ran into Harry in the coffee shop, nonetheless she had ran into Tom.</p><p>Y/N was typing away furiously on her laptop when he had approached her. Y/N had her eyebrows knitted together; her notebook was carelessly lying near her with all the bullet points about the assignment.</p><p>\u201cMay I sit here,\u201d Tom had said, but Y/N was too busy to recognize his voice. She was about shoo away whoever it was, but that was until she realized who it was.</p><p>Y/N had looked at his face for a while. A bit shocked - not expecting to see him there and then contemplating whether to say yes or not.</p><p>\u201cUh yeah,\u201d she had stuttered out after a while gesturing to the sit across her. Tom had happily sat down and started a conversation about college and what she was doing. At first it was just about college but then they started talking about personal stuffs -what they liked, what they didn\u2019t, their families.</p><p>By 8, they had another mug of hot chocolate and Tom ended up sitting next to her in excuse of seeing what she was doing.</p><p>Y/N had finished half of the assignment after sitting there for five hours. Y/N knew she would\u2019ve finished the whole thing, if Tom hadn\u2019t interrupted but she wasn\u2019t complaining - she had a little crush on him after all.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Y/N,\u201d Clare said from the couch.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s glowing, what happened?\u201d Jake asked seeing the bright smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she shook her head, but she couldn\u2019t shake of the huge smile.</p><p>\u201cC'mere, Iccy!\u201d Y/N gestured Ice Cream to follow her upstairs, who was on her feet almost instantly, moving her tail happily.</p><p>Y/N slowly made her way up the stairs, Ice Cream hot on her trail.</p><p>\u201cYou missed me, buddy?\u201d Y/N said looking down at the 3 years old Samoyed as she earned a loud bark from her.</p><p>Y/N laughed. She knew how clingy she was and she knew the only thing Ice Cream wanted to do then was cuddle her. And she didn\u2019t mind that. Y/N was about to take the turn towards her room but that is when she smashed into something hard making her stumble a little backward; the back of her leg coming in contact with Ice Creams body made her lose control. She was about fall on her butt and probably over Ice Cream but Y/N quickly grabbed the stairs railing as Ice Cream moved away from her spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! Are you okay?\u201d Harry asked. He had both of his hands extended towards her - probably to grab her incase she hadn\u2019t gotten hold of the railings. He wore a horrified look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWas okay,\u201d Y/N mumbled walking past Harry and into her room.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m really sorry about that wasn\u2019t looking where I was going,\u201d Harry said. But the moment Ice Cream had entered her room, she quickly shut the door without looking up at him.</p><p>And there, she shut the door on his face for the second time, leaving him clueless in the hallway.</p><p><i>She really didn\u2019t like him.</i></p>",

A bit shocked - not expecting to see him there and then contemplating whether to say yes or not.</p><p>\u201cUh yeah,\u201d she had stuttered out after a while gesturing to the sit across her. Tom had happily sat down and started a conversation about college and what she was doing. At first it was just about college but then they started talking about personal stuffs -what they liked, what they didn\u2019t, their families.</p><p>By 8, they had another mug of hot chocolate and Tom ended up sitting next to her in excuse of seeing what she was doing.</p><p>Y/N had finished half of the assignment after sitting there for five hours. Y/N knew she would\u2019ve finished the whole thing, if Tom hadn\u2019t interrupted but she wasn\u2019t complaining - she had a little crush on him after all.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Y/N,\u201d Clare said from the couch.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s glowing, what happened?\u201d Jake asked seeing the bright smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she shook her head, but she couldn\u2019t shake of the huge smile.</p><p>\u201cC'mere, Iccy!\u201d Y/N gestured Ice Cream to follow her upstairs, who was on her feet almost instantly, moving her tail happily.</p><p>Y/N slowly made her way up the stairs, Ice Cream hot on her trail.</p><p>\u201cYou missed me, buddy?\u201d Y/N said looking down at the 3 years old Samoyed as she earned a loud bark from her.</p><p>Y/N laughed. She knew how clingy she was and she knew the only thing Ice Cream wanted to do then was cuddle her. And she didn\u2019t mind that. Y/N was about to take the turn towards her room but that is when she smashed into something hard making her stumble a little backward; the back of her leg coming in contact with Ice Creams body made her lose control. She was about fall on her butt and probably over Ice Cream but Y/N quickly grabbed the stairs railing as Ice Cream moved away from her spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! Are you okay?\u201d Harry asked. He had both of his hands extended towards her - probably to grab her incase she hadn\u2019t gotten hold of the railings. He wore a horrified look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWas okay,\u201d Y/N mumbled walking past Harry and into her room.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m really sorry about that wasn\u2019t looking where I was going,\u201d Harry said. But the moment Ice Cream had entered her room, she quickly shut the door without looking up at him.</p><p>And there, she shut the door on his face for the second time, leaving him clueless in the hallway.</p><p><i>She really didn\u2019t like him.</i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Chapter Two | Two Weeks</h1><p><i>- the series where Y/N and Harry aren&rsquo;t much fond of each other&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><b>A/N: Please head to my master list for Chapter One. Tumblr isn&rsquo;t tagging my post if I use any links!</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have to tell you this, but -&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N was trying to stuff few of her books in her bag when Jake spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Y/N didn&rsquo;t look up at him, she was too busy with her books and her bag.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay away from Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N came to an halt hearing that.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; she was confused really, why was her uncle saying that, all of a sudden. She clearly remembered the &lsquo;she&rsquo;s off limit&rsquo; thing he said to Harry, but Jake also knew she didn&rsquo;t really like him</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about,&rdquo; she returned to zip her bag full of books. She was pretty sure her shoulder would be sore for carrying it but she had to return those books to the college library by that day.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, he- just stay away from him,&rdquo; Jake said again.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? I mean isn&rsquo;t he &lsquo;such a nice guy&rsquo;,&rdquo; Y/N said nonchalantly, not bothering to look up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;He is but, you know - there&rsquo;s media involved, and his fans can be pretty aggressive and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll work out. I mean he&rsquo;s good guy but I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt ag-&rdquo; Jake rambled on but Y/N quickly cut him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, calm down,&rdquo; she hung the bag on her back and let out a groan. It was heavier than she thought it&rsquo;d be.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not interested.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is the &lsquo;nice guy&rsquo;, anyway?&rdquo; She made her way towards the door</p><p>&ldquo;He had work in his studio.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded, but she truly didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>&ldquo;See you later,&rdquo; she called.</p><p>She heard Jake and Clare both call back from inside the house before she shut the door.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Enough already!&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s best friend, Emilia exclaimed but her voice was just audible for Y/N to hear.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N asked clearly clueless as she flipped few pages of the new book she just took from the library shelf.</p><p>&ldquo;All you do is read, can you not take a break?&rdquo; Emilia huffed, poking on the new thousand pages book - just about the evolution of architectures over time.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fun,&rdquo; Emilia paused. &ldquo;But, I can show you what real fun is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>However, Emilia didn&rsquo;t have to speak further for making Y/N understand what she was suggesting.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; she said dismissively.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh c'mon!&rdquo; Emilia pleaded. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be for too long! We&rsquo;ll drop you off by midnight!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Emilia. I&rsquo;m nothing going,&rdquo; Y/N scrolled through her book trying to take in all the subjects and architecture monuments it talked about. &ldquo;And you said in a way, it almost sounded as if your suggesting something&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Emilia didn&rsquo;t reply to that or said anything at all for a while. Y/N almost thought she gave up but was she wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; she yelled making everyone in the library look at her with wide eyes, including Y/N and except Tom. He had a pair of headphones on.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Y/N whispered yelled as she looked at Mrs. Valenta the librarian across the room strolling towards them. Emilia didn&rsquo;t bother to reply. She just got up and pulled Y/N up with her. This made Mrs. Valenta stop on her way and, look at them skeptically.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Y/N exclaimed pulling her hand away from Emilia&rsquo;s and grabbing her bag, closing the book on the process. Y/N thought they were leaving but surely Emilia had different plans.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you have a little crush on him!&rdquo; she whispered with a smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N said dumb founded, her heart beat rising slightly - <i>how could she have known?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act stupid, I saw how you look at him,&rdquo; Emilia let out a chuckle.</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes, &ldquo;yeah right!&rdquo; Even though Y/N was pretty sure that she didn&rsquo;t look at him any differently, she was still a little scared. She didn&rsquo;t want him or anyone to know about this.</p><p>Y/N looked up at Mrs. Valenta who had gone back to her sit, thinking they were leaving. Y/N thought that too but that was until Emilia dragged Y/N to where Tom was sitting the she was about to walk out of the room. However, if Y/N was honest she was kindof expecting this.</p><p>&ldquo;Hola,&rdquo; Emilia patted Tom&rsquo;s back as she sat next to him, almost startling him. Y/N walked around the table and took the sit across them.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said to both of them, of course a little confused.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I heard you&rsquo;re going to the party Lilly&rsquo;s having tonight?&rdquo; Emilia asked him making Y/N roll her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah&hellip;.?&rdquo; Tom said uncertainly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was trying to get Y/N come with me, but she wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; she paused. &ldquo;So, I was hoping you&rsquo;d help me out here. I mean both of you love books, but Y/N look - even he likes to go to party every now and then!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I don&rsquo;t want to go either, Lucas -he&rsquo;s sorta forcing me.&rdquo;</p><p>This made Emilia&rsquo;s face palm and Y/N giggle. However, Tom quickly added looking at Y/N with a smile, &ldquo;but you can come you know, I&rsquo;ll find someone to hangout with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; Y/N said. Still smiling slightly she got up from her chair.</p><p>&ldquo;C'mon, Y/N one party,&rdquo; Emilia insisted but Y/N pressed her lips together and shook her head. Nevertheless it was enough for Emilia to shut up.</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; Y/N said happily as she entered the house and closed the door behind her.</p><p>It was almost 9 pm when she returned. Both her uncle and aunt were cuddled up on the couch, binge watching some tv shows. Ice Cream was peacefully snoozing on the floor- however she woke up just the second she heard Y/N&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s college had ended a long time ago but she decided to go to a coffee shop to finish an assignment that she had. Or maybe she just didn&rsquo;t want to see Harry&rsquo;s face or be in his presence at all -everything about him annoyed her, even thinking about him for a split second made her scrunch her nose in annoyance. Y/N knew she shouldn&rsquo;t be this judgmental as she met him just the night before and for couple of minutes only. But she couldn&rsquo;t help herself, something about him just made her not like him.</p><p>As Y/N expected she hadn&rsquo;t ran into Harry in the coffee shop, nonetheless she had ran into Tom.</p><p>Y/N was typing away furiously on her laptop when he had approached her. Y/N had her eyebrows knitted together; her notebook was carelessly lying near her with all the bullet points about the assignment.</p><p>&ldquo;May I sit here,&rdquo; Tom had said, but Y/N was too busy to recognize his voice. She was about shoo away whoever it was, but that was until she realized who it was.</p><p>Y/N had looked at his face for a while.
