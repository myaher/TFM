Loki just kept staring you with mischief on his face. You wanted to know why he was here because of none of the Avengers knew why. </p><p>Nat would of course know because of her skills but, seeing that she was in a heating argument with your father, that was the chance you had to sneak out.

Amongst Thanos\u2019 soldiers, the name was enough to instantly inspire throughout their ranks a feeling of grudging respect, reluctant admiration, and no small amount of fear, if they were being completely honest. He was legendary among the mad titan\u2019s armies for his ability to withstand their most creative and brutal tortures. It had taken them over a year to break him, which was an unprecedented record amongst torturers so skillful and vindictive as they were. Even then, he hadn\u2019t agreed to do their bidding of his own free will, and the torture had only served to make him weak enough that the mind stone was actually effective in bringing him under their master\u2019s control. Loki had managed to withstand and repel the power of an infinity stone for over a year. And in the part of their minds where they kept their deepest, darkest secrets, Thanos\u2019 soldiers were afraid of Loki. So afraid, in fact, that at times they had gone too far, to the point where the Asgardian\u2019s heart had stopped beating and they were sure this was the end for them, having killed Thanos\u2019 prized asset (the ability to Skywalk wasn\u2019t something found every day, after all, and was highly necessary for Thanos\u2019 plans to retrieve the tesseract).  But he never stayed down, no matter how far they went with their fire and their whips and their weapons of all sorts, and while the fact that he wouldn\u2019t stay dead was a relief (as it meant that they hadn\u2019t accidentally broken their master\u2019s new toy beyond repair) it terrified them a little more every time it happened.  </p><p>    Once they\u2019d finally carried out their mission and Loki was under the control of Thanos and his Lieutenant, known only as The Other, they thought that surely he would not last a week after carrying out his great mission. But he\u2019d surprised them all, even Thanos, by not only subverting the control of the mind stone enough to fail, but breaking it completely with nothing more than an (albeit fairly intense) blow to the head. It shouldn\u2019t have been possible. Nothing that Loki did should have been possible. And so they feared him, even under their sneers and jibes and taunts in his direction as they tortured him, and even afterwards, they would look warily around the room as if to ensure he wasn\u2019t somehow watching before they began to talk of him. </p><p>    Although his children and his soldiers would never acknowledge it, he was sometimes far too arrogant for his own good, and as they watched him supposedly choke Loki to death after receiving the tesseract during their attack on the Asgardian Statesman, they could not help but fear that something wasn\u2019t right with the way their greatest foe had gone down so easily and without circumstance.  The fear prickled in the backs of their minds and they spoke of it in hushed tones when they were alone, free from the fear of being overheard by a superior officer who would no doubt discipline them severely for doubting their master. </p><p>    As it turns out, they were right to worry. </p>",

And then it wouldn\u2019t leave me alone so I wrote a Drabble whoops. </h1><p>    Loki. Amongst Thanos\u2019 soldiers, the name was enough to instantly inspire throughout their ranks a feeling of grudging respect, reluctant admiration, and no small amount of fear, if they were being completely honest. He was legendary among the mad titan\u2019s armies for his ability to withstand their most creative and brutal tortures. It had taken them over a year to break him, which was an unprecedented record amongst torturers so skillful and vindictive as they were. Even then, he hadn\u2019t agreed to do their bidding of his own free will, and the torture had only served to make him weak enough that the mind stone was actually effective in bringing him under their master\u2019s control. Loki had managed to withstand and repel the power of an infinity stone for over a year. And in the part of their minds where they kept their deepest, darkest secrets, Thanos\u2019 soldiers were afraid of Loki. So afraid, in fact, that at times they had gone too far, to the point where the Asgardian\u2019s heart had stopped beating and they were sure this was the end for them, having killed Thanos\u2019 prized asset (the ability to Skywalk wasn\u2019t something found every day, after all, and was highly necessary for Thanos\u2019 plans to retrieve the tesseract).  But he never stayed down, no matter how far they went with their fire and their whips and their weapons of all sorts, and while the fact that he wouldn\u2019t stay dead was a relief (as it meant that they hadn\u2019t accidentally broken their master\u2019s new toy beyond repair) it terrified them a little more every time it happened.  </p><p>    Once they\u2019d finally carried out their mission and Loki was under the control of Thanos and his Lieutenant, known only as The Other, they thought that surely he would not last a week after carrying out his great mission. But he\u2019d surprised them all, even Thanos, by not only subverting the control of the mind stone enough to fail, but breaking it completely with nothing more than an (albeit fairly intense) blow to the head. It shouldn\u2019t have been possible. Nothing that Loki did should have been possible. And so they feared him, even under their sneers and jibes and taunts in his direction as they tortured him, and even afterwards, they would look warily around the room as if to ensure he wasn\u2019t somehow watching before they began to talk of him. </p><p>    Although his children and his soldiers would never acknowledge it, he was sometimes far too arrogant for his own good, and as they watched him supposedly choke Loki to death after receiving the tesseract during their attack on the Asgardian Statesman, they could not help but fear that something wasn\u2019t right with the way their greatest foe had gone down so easily and without circumstance.  The fear prickled in the backs of their minds and they spoke of it in hushed tones when they were alone, free from the fear of being overheard by a superior officer who would no doubt discipline them severely for doubting their master. </p><p>    As it turns out, they were right to worry. </p></p>",

His mother, father, brother, most of his if not all of his people, his girlfriend, his best friends, his eye, his home, trust me the list goes on. All I&rsquo;m saying is, what else has he got? Some powers and a grief strikes heart. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t just give up. Did you even watch IW? He did his best, and sometimes your best doesn&rsquo;t cut it but he tried and he gave it his all, and it didn&rsquo;t work. Even after everything he tried with all those deaths and losses in mind probably weighing down on him, he still lost.</p><p>Now think about all that. All that swirling around in his head for five years. All that guilt, anger, sadness, the realization that he couldn&rsquo;t do the one thing he had left. To avenge those he lost. </p><p>That would depress anyone. Man or god. And we&rsquo;ve all learned Thor is more man than god at this point. </p><p>Depression often (at least for me) leads to heavy dissociation, I don&rsquo;t want to get up. I don&rsquo;t want to work or feel or do anything. I just want to do everything to try and forget. Pretend like its not happening. I wont take care of myself and sometimes I&rsquo;ll binge eat because of stress. </p><p>Group all that into one and you&rsquo;ve got and man who&rsquo;s lost everyone and everything that was ever important to him, who was at the top and beaten down as low as he could go and who couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it, and because of it went into a depressive dissociation to do the one thing he had left FORGET. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, look at how hard he gripped Bruce&rsquo;s arm at the mere mention of Thanos&rsquo; name. Begging Bruce not to mention. He wants so badly for all of it to go away. </p><p>If you can&rsquo;t sympathize with him or even try and understand why he behaves the way he does after that, then idk what to tell you. </p><p>TLDR: In this house we stan Thor because he was a happy, strong, brave beautiful sweetheart who the universe decided to beat down until we could nearly recognize him. </p>",
