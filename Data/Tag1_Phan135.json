Her name was Louise and all her knew about her was that she was a blonde who died the tips of her hair funky colors.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe made it to her door and knocked twice before a \u201cCome in\u201d rang out and Phil pushed down the door handle.\u00a0</p><p>\tLouise was sat at her desk, her hair put half up and a blazer buttoned tight around her waist. She was scribbling something onto a pad of paper but Phil just quickly took a seat and waited.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, hi, Philip.\u201d Oh right. He\u2019d forgotten. She called him Philip.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe cringed internally.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe have a few options for your next assignment and if you give me two minutes I can print them off and give them to you to read over. One is for next weeks episode of the BBC London Podcast and the other is that we need a new snazzy looking logo to go with the BBC Radio website.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tLouise tapped away at her keyboard and Phil waited patiently. Somewhere in the distance, Louise\u2019s printer whirled and she stood up, walking over to it, and picking up the papers.\u00a0</p><p>\tShe flipped through each paper and then handed them to Phil to look over. \u201cJust so you know, you can choose any one of the assignments but the one for the BBC website is a little bit more in demand.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at both of the pages and decides he\u2019d rather do the BBC website first anyway since it\u2019ll take up less of his time. \u201cI think I\u2019ll work on the BBC website this afternoon and then begin the one for the podcast as soon as I\u2019m done.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tLouise smiled. \u201cHave fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil just gave her a cut nod and grabbed his papers as he walked out of her office and down the hall back to his own.

I\u2019ll be late.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughed to himself and plopped into his desk chair, ignoring how it creaked because it was slightly old and way too overused. He opened his laptop and opened up Illustrator as he prepared to begin the new logo.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was already into gradient coloring a circle when PJ interrupted him. \u201cHow did yesterday with Dan go?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his shoulders tense and he looked up from his laptop, his teeth unintentionally grinding together. \u201cIt didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ adjusted his glasses on the edge of the nose and then looks at Phil with furrowed brows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head and reached up, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cWe met up like planned and I took him to the eye. He was very nice and kind and I really enjoyed the little time we spent together. But then when we got off, the paparazzi and a bunch of teens and adults were waiting for us and he asked to go back to the hotel.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ spun in his chair and took off his glasses. \u201cWait, what happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExactly what I just said.\u201d Phil commented, feeling his stomach begin to knot.\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ opened and closed his mouth softly before he remained silent. He looked between the floor and Phil. \u201cDid&hellip;did he just like&hellip;not want to be around you anymore? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, Peej&hellip;nothing like that.\u201d Phil says, his voice softer than before. \u201cDan was very overwhelmed and I think he just needed to be alone.\u201d PJ nodded once and then gave him a soft smile. \u201cBut he texted me after and I think it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ began to speak again when the sound of footsteps behind them grew louder and Phil turned. He sighed quite loudly when he saw Gemma walking their way, her heels someone still sounding loud on the carpeted floors.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil Lester!\u201d Gemma called out as he approached his desk and yanked an empty chair up to the side. She fell into it and settled at his desk. \u201cWhat did you have to do to get a Daniel Howell follow and why didn\u2019t I know about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil rolled his eyes and sat back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing, Phil!\u201d Gemma pushed. \u201cDaniel Howell followed you and I want to know how you managed that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugged. \u201cWe met on set.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOn set?!\u201d Gemma exclaimed. \u201cOh why couldn\u2019t I have been on set and maybe I would have gotten one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey!\u201d PJ called from the side. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a Dan follow and I was on set.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma looked at Phil with big eyes. \u201cHow did you manage to get one then, Phil? Spill your secrets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe talked, he asked for my Twitter and Instagram and I gave it to him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe just asked for that?\u201d Gemma asked, her voice incredulous. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like this isn\u2019t a big deal. Phil, you got a Daniel Howell follow.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d Phil said back. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to really even say about it. Dan\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma sat back. \u201cHave you been speaking with him?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cA little bit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma\u2019s eyes bugged out of her head. \u201cA little bit? How is this not a big deal, Phil! You\u2019re talking to a literal celebrity.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Phil reiterated. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal because it\u2019s just Dan. He\u2019s a normal guy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u2018Wow, you\u2019re getting a little aggressive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma cut off her words before shooting him a side ways glance. Phil let\u2019s out a breath and looks up just in time to see PJ staring at him with a look of what are you doing?\u00a0</p><p>\tFrankly, Phil doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing anymore when it comes to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tAll he knows is that Dan\u2019s been messaging him since Tuesday and everything seemed to be better. But Dan was returning back to the USA to finish filming as they speak on his fancy private jet. According to Dan, he wasn\u2019t even a fan of a private jet but everyone told him how it was essential for travel.</p><p>\tHe feels like it\u2019s stupid but Phil honestly would kill for a ride in Dan\u2019s private jet with him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head and looks back at Gemma with a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve had a long few days. I know it\u2019s not an excuse to be a dick but\u2015\u201d</p><p>\tShe flashed him a wide toothed smile and stood up from the chair she was sat in, brushing down her dress back to laying flat against her thighs. \u2018That\u2019s okay, Phil. I understand it. We all have those weeks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tShe flashed another quick smile at him and then left the office, her heels still managing to make a noise against the carpet. Phil turned his attention back to his laptop and saw a new message on his Instagram\u2026that he wouldn\u2019t admit that he had open just in case Dan messaged him. And this time, he did.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt read:\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>danielhowell: </b>what\u2019s your number? Texting will work better for me when I\u2019m in the states.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s reacting to it until PJ scoffs. \u201cWhat did Mr. Howell send you now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe wants my number.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ cocked and eyebrow. \u201cReally moving fast, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He joked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughed and finished typing out his number to Dan. \u201cDan\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd really, that\u2019s the complete truth.\u00a0</p>",

He looked between the floor and Phil. \u201cDid\u2026did he just like\u2026not want to be around you anymore? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, Peej\u2026nothing like that.\u201d Phil says, his voice softer than before. \u201cDan was very overwhelmed and I think he just needed to be alone.\u201d PJ nodded once and then gave him a soft smile. \u201cBut he texted me after and I think it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ began to speak again when the sound of footsteps behind them grew louder and Phil turned. He sighed quite loudly when he saw Gemma walking their way, her heels someone still sounding loud on the carpeted floors.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil Lester!\u201d Gemma called out as he approached his desk and yanked an empty chair up to the side. She fell into it and settled at his desk. \u201cWhat did you have to do to get a Daniel Howell follow and why didn\u2019t I know about it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil rolled his eyes and sat back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing, Phil!\u201d Gemma pushed. \u201cDaniel Howell followed you and I want to know how you managed that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shrugged. \u201cWe met on set.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOn set?!\u201d Gemma exclaimed. \u201cOh why couldn\u2019t I have been on set and maybe I would have gotten one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey!\u201d PJ called from the side. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a Dan follow and I was on set.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma looked at Phil with big eyes. \u201cHow did you manage to get one then, Phil? Spill your secrets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe talked, he asked for my Twitter and Instagram and I gave it to him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe just asked for that?\u201d Gemma asked, her voice incredulous. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like this isn\u2019t a big deal. Phil, you got a Daniel Howell follow.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d Phil said back. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to really even say about it. Dan\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma sat back. \u201cHave you been speaking with him?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cA little bit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma\u2019s eyes bugged out of her head. \u201cA little bit? How is this not a big deal, Phil! You\u2019re talking to a literal celebrity.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Phil reiterated. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal because it\u2019s just Dan. He\u2019s a normal guy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u2018Wow, you\u2019re getting a little aggressive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma cut off her words before shooting him a side ways glance. Phil let\u2019s out a breath and looks up just in time to see PJ staring at him with a look of what are you doing?\u00a0</p><p>\tFrankly, Phil doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing anymore when it comes to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tAll he knows is that Dan\u2019s been messaging him since Tuesday and everything seemed to be better. But Dan was returning back to the USA to finish filming as they speak on his fancy private jet. According to Dan, he wasn\u2019t even a fan of a private jet but everyone told him how it was essential for travel.</p><p>\tHe feels like it\u2019s stupid but Phil honestly would kill for a ride in Dan\u2019s private jet with him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head and looks back at Gemma with a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve had a long few days. I know it\u2019s not an excuse to be a dick but\u2015\u201d</p><p>\tShe flashed him a wide toothed smile and stood up from the chair she was sat in, brushing down her dress back to laying flat against her thighs. \u2018That\u2019s okay, Phil. I understand it. We all have those weeks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tShe flashed another quick smile at him and then left the office, her heels still managing to make a noise against the carpet. Phil turned his attention back to his laptop and saw a new message on his Instagram\u2026that he wouldn\u2019t admit that he had open just in case Dan messaged him. And this time, he did.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt read:\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>danielhowell: </b>what\u2019s your number? Texting will work better for me when I\u2019m in the states.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s reacting to it until PJ scoffs. \u201cWhat did Mr. Howell send you now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHe wants my number.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ cocked and eyebrow. \u201cReally moving fast, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He joked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil laughed and finished typing out his number to Dan. \u201cDan\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tAnd really, that\u2019s the complete truth.\u00a0</p>",

He looked between the floor and Phil. &ldquo;Did&hellip;did he just like&hellip;not want to be around you anymore? I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, Peej&hellip;nothing like that.&rdquo; Phil says, his voice softer than before. &ldquo;Dan was very overwhelmed and I think he just needed to be alone.&rdquo; PJ nodded once and then gave him a soft smile. &ldquo;But he texted me after and I think it&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ began to speak again when the sound of footsteps behind them grew louder and Phil turned. He sighed quite loudly when he saw Gemma walking their way, her heels someone still sounding loud on the carpeted floors.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil Lester!&rdquo; Gemma called out as he approached his desk and yanked an empty chair up to the side. She fell into it and settled at his desk. &ldquo;What did you have to do to get a Daniel Howell follow and why didn&rsquo;t I know about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil rolled his eyes and sat back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nothing, Phil!&rdquo; Gemma pushed. &ldquo;Daniel Howell followed you and I want to know how you managed that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shrugged. &ldquo;We met on set.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;On set?!&rdquo; Gemma exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh why couldn&rsquo;t I have been on set and maybe I would have gotten one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; PJ called from the side. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get a Dan follow and I was on set.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tGemma looked at Phil with big eyes. &ldquo;How did you manage to get one then, Phil? Spill your secrets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We talked, he asked for my Twitter and Instagram and I gave it to him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He just asked for that?&rdquo; Gemma asked, her voice incredulous. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting like this isn&rsquo;t a big deal. Phil, you got a Daniel Howell follow.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not.&rdquo; Phil said back. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to really even say about it. Dan&rsquo;s a nice guy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tGemma sat back. &ldquo;Have you been speaking with him?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;A little bit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tGemma&rsquo;s eyes bugged out of her head. &ldquo;A little bit? How is this not a big deal, Phil! You&rsquo;re talking to a literal celebrity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a big deal.&rdquo; Phil reiterated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a big deal because it&rsquo;s just Dan. He&rsquo;s a normal guy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&lsquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re getting a little aggressive, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tGemma cut off her words before shooting him a side ways glance. Phil let&rsquo;s out a breath and looks up just in time to see PJ staring at him with a look of what are you doing?&nbsp;</p><p>\tFrankly, Phil doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing anymore when it comes to Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAll he knows is that Dan&rsquo;s been messaging him since Tuesday and everything seemed to be better. But Dan was returning back to the USA to finish filming as they speak on his fancy private jet. According to Dan, he wasn&rsquo;t even a fan of a private jet but everyone told him how it was essential for travel.</p><p>\tHe feels like it&rsquo;s stupid but Phil honestly would kill for a ride in Dan&rsquo;s private jet with him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shakes his head and looks back at Gemma with a sympathetic look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ve had a long few days. I know it&rsquo;s not an excuse to be a dick but&#8213;&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe flashed him a wide toothed smile and stood up from the chair she was sat in, brushing down her dress back to laying flat against her thighs. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s okay, Phil. I understand it. We all have those weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tShe flashed another quick smile at him and then left the office, her heels still managing to make a noise against the carpet. Phil turned his attention back to his laptop and saw a new message on his Instagram&hellip;that he wouldn&rsquo;t admit that he had open just in case Dan messaged him. And this time, he did.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt read:&nbsp;</p><p>\t<b>danielhowell: </b>what&rsquo;s your number? Texting will work better for me when I&rsquo;m in the states.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe doesn&rsquo;t even realize he&rsquo;s reacting to it until PJ scoffs. &ldquo;What did Mr. Howell send you now?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He wants my number.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPJ cocked and eyebrow. &ldquo;Really moving fast, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; He joked.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil laughed and finished typing out his number to Dan. &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s a nice guy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tAnd really, that&rsquo;s the complete truth.&nbsp;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star.
