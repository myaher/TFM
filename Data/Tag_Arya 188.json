I\u2019m not sure if Arya still has this romanticized notion of what being a Lord is, someone who fights in wars and has adventures, but it mostly involves management of your castle and lands.

Sansa would not remove herself from that obligation. Maybe she tricks Arya a little? Arya hits Sansa during their lesson and Sansa pretends to be hurt worse than she is. Arya starts to apologize and Sansa pushes her down. Sansa makes a point to Arya about Cersei and how tricky and manipulative she is. How they can\u2019t fight Cersei the same way they will fight the Night King and Cersei might be just as dangerous as he is.</p><p>My highest hope for next season is for Arya and Sansa to be there for each other. Listening to each other. Understanding each other. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get any hackneyed fight like last season but I hope they don\u2019t let their relationship completely fall by the way side for more \u201cimportant\u201d things.<br/></p>",

As a group, we write individually but we come together to share our collective experiences with different media. For TGE Watches, we talk about movies and TV shows. TGE Plays, we play games together. For TGE Reads, we select a book, read it, and then discuss it together. We are hoping through our collective knowledge and know-how to share these geeky interests with our readers, viewers, and listeners. \n\nListen to our podcast at https://www.thegeekembassy.com/category/podcast",
