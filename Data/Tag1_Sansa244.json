But ever since she met Jon, Sansa has nothing left to wish for.</small></p><p><small><i>Modern AU</i></small></p></blockquote><p>Sansa bit on the back of her pencil and stared at the small empty paper in front of her. She could already smell the burning fire outside and she could already hear her siblings giggling and laughing, making jokes no one but them really thought were funny. </p><p>Christmas was always her favorite time of the year. It was the only time all of them returned home for a few huge dinners and all those Christmas traditions they had made up over the years. </p><p>This tradition existed because of her. She had once seen it on television and she had liked the thought of it so much that she had begged her entire family to just do it, only once. But only once had turned into yearly and now it was the highlight of their celebrations.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Jon walked into her bedroom with his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cYour siblings ask when you\u2019re coming down. They wanna get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m still thinking about my wish.\u201d Sansa leaned back and a smile spread across her face. \u201cFor years I\u2019ve written down the same things over and over again, but\u2026\u201d She reached out her hand and a pleasant kind of warmth spread through her body when Jon grabbed it. \u201cAll of those wishes have come true ever since I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them already?\u201d Jon raised his eyebrows and his cheeks colored a beautiful shade of reddish. \u201cYou make me sound like some prince charming that came in and saved the day or something.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Sansa took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it like that and you know it!\u201d Sansa raised her voice and let his hand go. \u201cI can take care of myself perfectly fine and if I can\u2019t, I have four amazing siblings who can do it for me.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not some poor cursed princess that needs saving. My parents were actually great, a little annoying at times, but that\u2019s normal, isn\u2019t it? I have a wonderful bond with my older brother, apart from those few times he teased me when I really wasn\u2019t in the right mood to take it. My sister and I are growing closer with every day that passes, even though we\u2019re completely different and sometimes seem to live in other worlds. My little brothers are adorable and ask for way too much time and attention, but I give it to them happily.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI never needed saving, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Year after year she had still written that same sentence on that small piece of paper, even though she knew she had to read it out loud when she would burn it, even though she had seen her siblings roll their eyes every year. And eventually it had worked.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you wish for then?\u201d Jon shifted his weight from one leg to the other while he kept his glance locked with hers. He was handsome, he was thoughtful. He sometimes forgot all those small anniversaries Sansa liked to celebrate, but he always surprised her with something big on the days that really mattered. Maybe he hadn\u2019t really saved her life, but he had made a huge difference and had changed everything, including her as a person, for the better.</p><p>Sansa smiled once more. \u201cI wished for a boyfriend.\u201d Sansa bent her head and bit her lip. \u201cNot because I thought that only a boyfriend could make me happy, but just because I wanted one. I wanted to know what all those girls at school talked about. I wanted to know what kissing felt like, what real kissing felt like, when you kiss someone you actually love and who actually loves you.\u201d</p><p>She had kissed boys before she had met Jon. As a sophomore she had kissed Jeoffrey Baratheon. </p><p>He had seemed handsome and witty and charming and he had been the unofficial king of the school. But his looks had been deceiving. It seemed that he had only wanted to kiss her, because he enjoyed breaking hearts and making fun of the girls trying to make it through their days after he had crushed their souls and stepped on it.</p><p>A year later she had been kissed by Ramsay Bolton. </p><p>He had invited her to the schoolbal, telling her that if she really had no one to go with, he would happily come with her so she could go anyway. But he had not told her that he had wanted payment for his company. And he had not told her that this payment would cost her her dignity, her pride and her reputation.</p><p>And therefore Sansa had written down that same wish over and over again. And year after year she had watched it burn. And every time she had wished that this time it would work and that her wish for the future would finally come true. </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that now you\u2019ve got me, you\u2019ve got nothing to wish for anymore?\u201d Jon wrapped his arms around her and kissed her red hair. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. You always have something to dream about, right? Just write it down.

They wanna get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still thinking about my wish.\u201d Sansa leaned back and a smile spread across her face. \u201cFor years I\u2019ve written down the same things over and over again, but\u2026\u201d She reached out her hand and a pleasant kind of warmth spread through her body when Jon grabbed it. \u201cAll of those wishes have come true ever since I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them already?\u201d Jon raised his eyebrows and his cheeks colored a beautiful shade of reddish. \u201cYou make me sound like some prince charming that came in and saved the day or something.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it like that and you know it!\u201d Sansa raised her voice and let his hand go. \u201cI can take care of myself perfectly fine and if I can\u2019t, I have four amazing siblings who can do it for me.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not some poor cursed princess that needs saving. My parents were actually great, a little annoying at times, but that\u2019s normal, isn\u2019t it? I have a wonderful bond with my older brother, apart from those few times he teased me when I really wasn\u2019t in the right mood to take it. My sister and I are growing closer with every day that passes, even though we\u2019re completely different and sometimes seem to live in other worlds. My little brothers are adorable and ask for way too much time and attention, but I give it to them happily.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI never needed saving, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Year after year she had still written that same sentence on that small piece of paper, even though she knew she had to read it out loud when she would burn it, even though she had seen her siblings roll their eyes every year. And eventually it had worked.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you wish for then?\u201d Jon shifted his weight from one leg to the other while he kept his glance locked with hers. He was handsome, he was thoughtful. He sometimes forgot all those small anniversaries Sansa liked to celebrate, but he always surprised her with something big on the days that really mattered. Maybe he hadn\u2019t really saved her life, but he had made a huge difference and had changed everything, including her as a person, for the better.</p><p>Sansa smiled once more. \u201cI wished for a boyfriend.\u201d Sansa bent her head and bit her lip. \u201cNot because I thought that only a boyfriend could make me happy, but just because I wanted one. I wanted to know what all those girls at school talked about. I wanted to know what kissing felt like, what real kissing felt like, when you kiss someone you actually love and who actually loves you.\u201d</p><p>She had kissed boys before she had met Jon. As a sophomore she had kissed Jeoffrey Baratheon. </p><p>He had seemed handsome and witty and charming and he had been the unofficial king of the school. But his looks had been deceiving. It seemed that he had only wanted to kiss her, because he enjoyed breaking hearts and making fun of the girls trying to make it through their days after he had crushed their souls and stepped on it.</p><p>A year later she had been kissed by Ramsay Bolton. </p><p>He had invited her to the schoolbal, telling her that if she really had no one to go with, he would happily come with her so she could go anyway. But he had not told her that he had wanted payment for his company. And he had not told her that this payment would cost her her dignity, her pride and her reputation.</p><p>And therefore Sansa had written down that same wish over and over again. And year after year she had watched it burn. And every time she had wished that this time it would work and that her wish for the future would finally come true. </p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that now you\u2019ve got me, you\u2019ve got nothing to wish for anymore?\u201d Jon wrapped his arms around her and kissed her red hair. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. You always have something to dream about, right? Just write it down. I mean, the wish doesn\u2019t have to come true this year already, right?\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cYou can find a new wish you can write down for the years to come.\u201d His lips brushed hers and then he stepped back. \u201cDon\u2019t take too long to come up with something, okay?

We&rsquo;re all waiting for you at the bonfire.&rdquo; Jon turned around and walked away and in that moment Sansa knew exactly what to wish for.</p><p>Five minutes later she entered the garden. The evening air was cold, even for the time of the year, but the heat of the fire lured her towards it and Jon and Robb made room for her in between them. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to our annual Christmas Bonfire!&rdquo; Sansa raised her voice, like she had done so many years and she made sure to look at all her siblings, at her parents and lastly at her boyfriend. &ldquo;May this fire keep our wishes passionate and burning until they&rsquo;ve come true.&rdquo; She paused for a short moment and then she held her own wish above the fire. &ldquo;I wish for a future with the most amazing man I&rsquo;ve ever met. I wish for him to ask me to marry him and I wish for a few wonderful kids joining us for this ceremony one day.&rdquo; She dropped the piece of paper and the brightly colored flames licked it and consumed it until the wish was nothing but ash anymore.</p><p>Maybe her wish wouldn&rsquo;t come true in the year to come. Certainly not her entire wish would come true in the year to come, but it was exactly like Jon said. She could now use that same wish a few years, until he would ask her to marry him and until they would help their kids to write down their wishes for the annual Christmas bonfire.</p></p>",

She could already smell the burning fire outside and she could already hear her siblings giggling and laughing, making jokes no one but them really thought were funny. </p>\n<p>Christmas was always her favorite time of the year. It was the only time all of them returned home for a few huge dinners and all those Christmas traditions they had made up over the years. </p>\n<p>This tradition existed because of her. She had once seen it on television and she had liked the thought of it so much that she had begged her entire family to just do it, only once. But only once had turned into yearly and now it was the highlight of their celebrations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Jon walked into her bedroom with his arms crossed over his chest. &ldquo;Your siblings ask when you&rsquo;re coming down. They wanna get started.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still thinking about my wish.&rdquo; Sansa leaned back and a smile spread across her face. &ldquo;For years I&rsquo;ve written down the same things over and over again, but&hellip;&rdquo; She reached out her hand and a pleasant kind of warmth spread through her body when Jon grabbed it. &ldquo;All of those wishes have come true ever since I met you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;All of them already?&rdquo; Jon raised his eyebrows and his cheeks colored a beautiful shade of reddish. &ldquo;You make me sound like some prince charming that came in and saved the day or something.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
