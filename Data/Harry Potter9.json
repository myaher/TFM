        "body": "<p>I had the privilege of watching James Phoon play Scorpius this past Saturday. I know that I am one of the lucky few, so I tried to take as many notes as I could in the dark so I could give an accurate account of his interpretation. he showed so much character understanding, I hope this does his justice.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Act 1:</b></h2><p><b>Meeting train scene:</b></p><p>In general his Scorpius had a nervous disposition, not that I felt James was nervous, I actually felt quite at ease for a debut. His voice was\u00a0 a bit squeaky, but (I think) more that he was playing an 11 year old than he was going for squeaky? I may be wrong, but that how I saw it, as it didn\u2019t go on past year 4 to the same level.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>On the train, he totally melts when he sees Rose. You know when you see someone really beautiful and your tummy flips? His body did that. it was the most adorable \u201chi Rose\u201d ever. </p><p>I noted that he\u2019s was a tad slow on social uptake. It felt like he hadn\u2019t interacted with his peers before and that was wonderful.\u00a0</p><p>An obviously he looked so, so cute (I wrote those actual words).</p><p>He sung the sweets song like a true Scorpius! Sing-songy and awkward but absolutely going for it.</p><p>He smiled away from Albus, towards the audience after he stays in the carriage for his sweets. </p><p><b>Year 1-4 sequence:</b></p><p>i read that he was happy but kinda indifferent about sorting into Slytherin. Sort of like\u00a0\u201cyeah, of course\u201d.</p><p>He is properly infatuated face at Rose, like a puppy (I mean it\u2019s Leah, go figure). A super cute schoolboy crush, I actually loved it.</p><p>He looks really upset at the teasing, like he wants to help Albus but doesn\u2019t know how and it really bothers him.</p><p>During the scene after Scorpius\u2019s mothers death, he doesn\u2019t look at Albus until he asks him to come to the funeral, hes fidgety and looking away from him and. seems nervous about asking.I adored that.</p><p>\u201cPotters don\u2019t belong in Slytherin\u201d is the sweetest thing (not sure what I meant by that, but there you go). </p><p>He worked really well with Joe, particularly in this act.\u00a0</p><p><b>Off the train:</b></p><p>He really thinks bread is a compliment and looked quite proud of himself.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this done before, but he was genuinely confused by the first hug. Which makes the next line make a lot of sense.</p><p>Adorably, his face lights up at the mention of a quiz.</p><p>He has a sarcastic edge with Albus. He\u2019s learning how to school him at this point, but isn\u2019t able to take control. On the roof that \u201csomething about you\u201d lin is wonderfully sassy.</p><p><b>St Oswalds:</b></p><p>He looks super lost with Amos and was really fidgety. You could tel, he felt out of place and wasn\u2019t sure what he was meant to be doing there.\u00a0</p><p><b>Polyjuicing:</b></p><p>He was not over the top and it was beautiful, I\u2019ve missed introverted Scorpius with all my heart and the was it was still funny without pushing it gave me life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Back out of bookcase:</b></p><p>When Scorpius is back to himself again he looks generally confused and a bit doomed.</p><p>There was lots of writhing on floor. Not a lot to explain there.</p><p>Body language: He generally fidgets with his hands but keeps his body still, like he\u2019s picking at his nails maybe. He holds his shoulders tensely like he\u2019s making himself smaller with his body language.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Act 2:</b></h2><p><b>Forest scene:</b></p><p>The first note I have from this act is just:</p><p>Whizzo &ndash;&gt; Melting! (I think I am melting!)</p><p>My heart hurt when Albus chooses Delphi for the Cedric question, its such a betrayal of a perfect friend.</p><p>He GRINS at Albus then standing up for him over Delphi.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look upset at not being kissed. His Scorpius has an air of acceptance of who he is, and that\u2019s really cool.\u00a0</p><p><b>In front of Hogwarts:</b></p><p>Real -time notes:</p><p>He looks up at Hogwarts with such love. He smiles ahead, holding his hands still in front of him. Seems content.</p><p>When he speaks you can tell he\u2019s actually scared. He\u2019s really vulnerable with Albus, more emotionally open than I\u2019ve seen for a while. He knows this character.</p><p><b>1st task:</b></p><p>He\u2019s actually shocked to see Hermione. Its adorable.\u00a0</p><p>HIS FAKE ACCENT IS GOLD.</p><p>He\u2019s really into watching the task, he really isn\u2019t a lot of help to Albus.</p><p>When the time-turner starts spinning, he really moves his body with it. It looks like it would hurt, which was really cool.\u00a0</p><p>The concern on his face when Albus hurt himself was filled with such love.\u00a0</p><p>He then did something I haven\u2019t ever seen before (I don\u2019t think?). When Albus said they should keep away from each other he stared Harry down with a pretty angry face. I loved that. Such a cool thing to think about.\u00a0</p><p><b>Staircase ballet</b> (an actual transcription of my notes):</p><p>He\u2019s happy, then quickly annoyed.</p><p>Has a blank, sad look.</p><p>Slight anger? Wow.\u00a0</p><p>Disbelief at top of stairs, can\u2019t stop looking at Albus.</p><p>Falls to his knees as stairs turn.</p><p>Still full of hope.</p><p><b>Scorp/Delphi chat:</b></p><p>Comes in lying on the steps, as if he\u2019s been crying.</p><p>Realised his mistake of getting angry at the owls quickly, but there was a genuine flash of anger there.\u00a0</p><p>When he asked\u00a0\u201cto do what?\u201d he was actually begging for help.\u00a0</p><p>Byt the end of this scene he looked hyped up and braver.\u00a0</p><p><b>Library scene:</b></p><p>He\u2019s fired up as he enters, with forced self-assurance.\u00a0</p><p>(Accidental hand hold)</p><p>He\u2019s really upset about what they\u2019ve done. Its clearly really affected him on top of Albus being awful.</p><p>He takes Albus\u2019s anger and just throws it back at him.\u00a0</p><p>Great pacing with the speech, but that anger is so there and fits really well with this version of Scorpius.\u00a0</p><p>After the cloak, he looks like he\u2019s questioning the VDM thing, which is super sad.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t linger on the Astoria lines (this is fair enough, and I think it works with the Scops that are angrier rather than upset in this scene).</p><p>Its like he doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s being unreasonable. He deserves to have a rnt now. He\u2019s more angry than sad but upset about it. Constantly welling up.\u00a0</p><p>When Albus says he\u2019s sorry he breaths again.\u00a0</p><p>He eats up Albus\u2019s nice words and it was beautiful.\u00a0</p><p>He had a side grin and a teary face.\u00a0</p><p>He stops before the hug and Joe has to encourage him into it. I like that he doesn\u2019t like physical contact, will make the hug in act 3 mean more.\u00a0</p><p><b>Myrtle:</b></p><p>He was so trusting of Albus. I loved it.\u00a0</p><p>He properly fangirled over Myrtle. Then a bit scared at the flirting. Then confused by her.\u00a0</p><p>He giggled is the most adorable way at\u00a0\u201cmoderately partial to a Malfoy&hellip;\u201d.</p><p>Is like\u00a0\u201cyeah Cedric was pretty, duh\u201d. Comfortable, subtle, queer Scorp is a thing of beauty and it was like coming home.</p><p>Looks excited at the adventure to come and really trusts Albus\u2019s plan.\u00a0</p><p>(April mounts him.)</p><p><b>Out of the lake:</b></p><p>(Apparently I objectified him and noted that he was quite fit.)</p><p>He starts panicking after he\u2019s shouted Albus\u2019s name twice.</p><p>Then fear really sets in.\u00a0</p><p>He seems to get whats going on from the way he says\u00a0\u201cHarry Potters dead?\u201d. Its a realisation, not a question\u00a0</p><p>Then hes just scared.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s really physical with the dementors which I thank.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Act 3:</b></h2><p><b>Umbridge&rsquo;s office:</b><br/></p><p>I feel like his Scorpius took her praise. That was really interesting, I loved that he really gets confidence from that.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s convincing. I think he would survive in the V world.\u00a0</p><p>The first VDM and Valour scares him.\u00a0</p><p><b>Polly:</b></p><p>I can only explain his face in this scene as confused.\u00a0</p><p>He stutters the for V&amp;V here.</p><p><b>Office scene:</b></p><p>He is initially hopeful but thats crushed so quickly. Its heartbreaking.\u00a0</p><p>He turns away while Draco is telling him of initially, like he\u2019s thinking about what to say next, and he\u2019s really strong when he replies.\u00a0</p><p>He seems so shocked that his dad is violent. I need this from Scorpius\u2019s. its a really key moment and he aced it.\u00a0</p><p>He clearly hates his family in this world. He basically spat the murky line.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s really strong in the last V&amp;V.\u00a0</p><p>Nobody has laughed at him this whole time. Its dead serious and its properly scary still. I really loved the atmosphere he created in the room.</p><p><b>Snape/ the campaign room:</b></p><p>He looked nervous about asking for help, but wasn\u2019t questioning his decision.\u00a0</p><p>When he talks about the other world, he gets so excited. He smiled for the first time that act.\u00a0</p><p>He seems to blindly trust Snape too. I loved the follower aspect to this Scorpius.\u00a0</p><p>Hermione seems to actually scare him which was great. Still keeping up that mood of not being safe.\u00a0</p><p><b>Patronus/the lake:</b></p><p>He turns to explain to Umbridge why he\u2019s there once she\u2019s made it clear she knows he\u2019s there.\u00a0</p><p>He looks in awe of the patronuses beauty and doesn\u2019t seem at all shocked that it\u2019s a doe- his Scorpius reads a lot.\u00a0</p><p><b>Out of the lake:</b></p><p>Kind of a shock that Albus appears- LOVE</p><p>There\u2019s a big hug and it\u2019s a big deal. I loved this so, so much.\u00a0</p><p><b>Scorbus dorm scene:</b></p><p>He tiptoed really well, which I feel like I don\u2019t see enough.\u00a0</p><p>He also looked like he loved scaring Albus which was playful and really cute, you get a glimpse of their normal friendship there.\u00a0</p><p>HE DID THE SAMUEL B SHEET THING AT MOLDY VOLDY!</p><p>The whole tone he sets is that he\u2019s trying to reassure Albus that is isn\u2019t all his fault.\u00a0</p><p>He was SO proud of the time turning line and not subtle about it.\u00a0</p><p><b>Owlery:</b></p><p>He\u2019s a bit exasperated by Albus, like he just wants the job done.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move for Delphi.\u00a0</p><p>He realises who Delphi is as soon as she says who she was brought up by and is instantly scared again.\u00a0</p><p><b>Torture scene:</b></p><p>He whimpers after he\u2019s tortures. I cannot explain how much this meant to be. I\u2019m sick of Scorpius\u2019s being in sooo much pain for a second and then fine? No. This is the way to play that spell.\u00a0</p><p>He fell to his knees as Craig was killed. I loved the timing.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s physically So good. It really looked like Delphi was dragging him to her by force.\u00a0</p><p>He. Kept. Looking. At. His. Dorm. Mate. Craig. Dead. On. The. Floor. (thank you, thank you, thank you).</p><p><b>Maze:</b></p><p>When he\u2019s tortured again he looked right at Albus like he was going to cry.\u00a0</p><p>Another cool, unique thing: he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at Cedric. That was so nice.\u00a0</p><p>By the end of this act he\u2019s taken charge.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Act 4:</b></h2><p>(I didn\u2019t really write notes here as I was tired and honestly this is my least favourite act.)</p><p><b>Godric&rsquo;s hollow (outside):</b></p><p>He actually seems to enjoy being there. Hes go this quirky, fun edge at all times when he\u2019s with Albus. He\u2019s super relaxed with him and different to when he\u2019s not with him.\u00a0</p><p>Hes sort of submitted to his doom at this point and just enjoying his time with Albus.\u00a0</p><p><b>Battle scene:</b></p><p>He looked a bit lost. This didn\u2019t look out of character because he was just crouching behind Draco and that worked (could\u2019ve been a debut thing but it worked with the character so who cares).</p><p>He kept one eye on Albus the whole time after Delphi was defeated and it was quite protective. Loved that.</p><p><b>The horrible death scene:</b></p><p>He looked like he was watching something horrible. Possibly more edged towards fear than sadness or anything else. Which makes sense considering he\u2019s seen his mum die and watching other people die too would be super scary. And he\u2019s lived in the V world. So this whole thing must be quite traumatic.</p><p>He turned into his dad when lily was threatened.</p><p><b>Act 4, Scene 14:</b></p><p>He was full of childish optimism about Rose and it was the cutest.\u00a0</p><p>He wasn\u2019t at all deterred or even sad about the rejection. I loved his self-assurance here. He\u2019s really had an arch.\u00a0</p><p>The flirting with Rose was pretty mid way between the gayest to straightest Scorps I\u2019ve seen. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful to anyone\u2019s imaginations but this kid is my beautiful middle of the spectrum baby and I want to give him a bi flag.\u00a0</p><p>(Am I reading into this? Yes. And I allowed to interpret this as I please? Hell yeah.)</p><p>Leah walked right up to him to say the\u00a0\u201cScorpion King\u201d line and he seemed to enjoy that (to be honest, I did too).</p><p>There was a promise in\u00a0\u201cthis new version of us\u201d and I melted. That\u2019s all I need from that line. Its nuanced. But it\u2019s <i>there</i>.</p><h2><b>Last word:</b></h2><p>James\u2019s Scorpius showed a really impressive character arch. In act 1 he was nervy, but sure of who he was. In act 2 he showed me the most brilliant build up of anger, in a way that I truly believe Scorpius would feel anger. In act 3 he commanded the mood of that whole room. And in act 4 he took hold of those heavy scene so gracefully.\u00a0</p><p>He was the introverted Scorpius that I love. And that I believe Albus wold love.</p><p>I really loved his interpretation, and i feel so blessed.</p><p>He owed it.</p>",

I cannot explain how much this meant to be. I\u2019m sick of Scorpius\u2019s being in sooo much pain for a second and then fine? No. This is the way to play that spell.\u00a0</p><p>He fell to his knees as Craig was killed. I loved the timing.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s physically So good. It really looked like Delphi was dragging him to her by force.\u00a0</p><p>He. Kept. Looking. At. His. Dorm. Mate. Craig. Dead. On. The. Floor. (thank you, thank you, thank you).</p><p><b>Maze:</b></p><p>When he\u2019s tortured again he looked right at Albus like he was going to cry.\u00a0</p><p>Another cool, unique thing: he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at Cedric. That was so nice.\u00a0</p><p>By the end of this act he\u2019s taken charge.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Act 4:</b></h2><p>(I didn\u2019t really write notes here as I was tired and honestly this is my least favourite act.)</p><p><b>Godric\u2019s hollow (outside):</b></p><p>He actually seems to enjoy being there. Hes go this quirky, fun edge at all times when he\u2019s with Albus. He\u2019s super relaxed with him and different to when he\u2019s not with him.\u00a0</p><p>Hes sort of submitted to his doom at this point and just enjoying his time with Albus.\u00a0</p><p><b>Battle scene:</b></p><p>He looked a bit lost. This didn\u2019t look out of character because he was just crouching behind Draco and that worked (could\u2019ve been a debut thing but it worked with the character so who cares).</p><p>He kept one eye on Albus the whole time after Delphi was defeated and it was quite protective. Loved that.</p><p><b>The horrible death scene:</b></p><p>He looked like he was watching something horrible. Possibly more edged towards fear than sadness or anything else. Which makes sense considering he\u2019s seen his mum die and watching other people die too would be super scary. And he\u2019s lived in the V world. So this whole thing must be quite traumatic.</p><p>He turned into his dad when lily was threatened.</p><p><b>Act 4, Scene 14:</b></p><p>He was full of childish optimism about Rose and it was the cutest.\u00a0</p><p>He wasn\u2019t at all deterred or even sad about the rejection. I loved his self-assurance here. He\u2019s really had an arch.\u00a0</p><p>The flirting with Rose was pretty mid way between the gayest to straightest Scorps I\u2019ve seen. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful to anyone\u2019s imaginations but this kid is my beautiful middle of the spectrum baby and I want to give him a bi flag.\u00a0</p><p>(Am I reading into this? Yes. And I allowed to interpret this as I please? Hell yeah.)</p><p>Leah walked right up to him to say the\u00a0\u201cScorpion King\u201d line and he seemed to enjoy that (to be honest, I did too).</p><p>There was a promise in\u00a0\u201cthis new version of us\u201d and I melted. That\u2019s all I need from that line. Its nuanced. But it\u2019s <i>there</i>.</p><h2><b>Last word:</b></h2><p>James\u2019s Scorpius showed a really impressive character arch. In act 1 he was nervy, but sure of who he was. In act 2 he showed me the most brilliant build up of anger, in a way that I truly believe Scorpius would feel anger. In act 3 he commanded the mood of that whole room. And in act 4 he took hold of those heavy scene so gracefully.\u00a0</p><p>He was the introverted Scorpius that I love. And that I believe Albus wold love.</p><p>I really loved his interpretation, and i feel so blessed.</p><p>He owed it.</p>",

I know that I am one of the lucky few, so I tried to take as many notes as I could in the dark so I could give an accurate account of his interpretation. he showed so much character understanding, I hope this does his justice.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Act 1:</b></h2><p><b>Meeting train scene:</b></p><p>In general his Scorpius had a nervous disposition, not that I felt James was nervous, I actually felt quite at ease for a debut. His voice was\u00a0 a bit squeaky, but (I think) more that he was playing an 11 year old than he was going for squeaky? I may be wrong, but that how I saw it, as it didn\u2019t go on past year 4 to the same level.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>On the train, he totally melts when he sees Rose. You know when you see someone really beautiful and your tummy flips? His body did that. it was the most adorable \u201chi Rose\u201d ever. </p><p>I noted that he\u2019s was a tad slow on social uptake. It felt like he hadn\u2019t interacted with his peers before and that was wonderful.\u00a0</p><p>An obviously he looked so, so cute (I wrote those actual words).</p><p>He sung the sweets song like a true Scorpius! Sing-songy and awkward but absolutely going for it.</p><p>He smiled away from Albus, towards the audience after he stays in the carriage for his sweets. </p><p><b>Year 1-4 sequence:</b></p><p>i read that he was happy but kinda indifferent about sorting into Slytherin. Sort of like\u00a0\u201cyeah, of course\u201d.</p><p>He is properly infatuated face at Rose, like a puppy (I mean it\u2019s Leah, go figure). A super cute schoolboy crush, I actually loved it.</p><p>He looks really upset at the teasing, like he wants to help Albus but doesn\u2019t know how and it really bothers him.</p><p>During the scene after Scorpius\u2019s mothers death, he doesn\u2019t look at Albus until he asks him to come to the funeral, hes fidgety and looking away from him and. seems nervous about asking.I adored that.</p><p>\u201cPotters don\u2019t belong in Slytherin\u201d is the sweetest thing (not sure what I meant by that, but there you go). </p><p>He worked really well with Joe, particularly in this act.\u00a0</p><p><b>Off the train:</b></p><p>He really thinks bread is a compliment and looked quite proud of himself.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this done before, but he was genuinely confused by the first hug. Which makes the next line make a lot of sense.</p><p>Adorably, his face lights up at the mention of a quiz.</p><p>He has a sarcastic edge with Albus. He\u2019s learning how to school him at this point, but isn\u2019t able to take control. On the roof that \u201csomething about you\u201d lin is wonderfully sassy.</p><p><b>St Oswalds:</b></p><p>He looks super lost with Amos and was really fidgety. You could tel, he felt out of place and wasn\u2019t sure what he was meant to be doing there.\u00a0</p><p><b>Polyjuicing:</b></p><p>He was not over the top and it was beautiful, I\u2019ve missed introverted Scorpius with all my heart and the was it was still funny without pushing it gave me life.\u00a0</p><p><b>Back out of bookcase:</b></p><p>When Scorpius is back to himself again he looks generally confused and a bit doomed.</p><p>There was lots of writhing on floor. Not a lot to explain there.</p><p>Body language: He generally fidgets with his hands but keeps his body still, like he\u2019s picking at his nails maybe. He holds his shoulders tensely like he\u2019s making himself smaller with his body language.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Act 2:</b></h2><p><b>Forest scene:</b></p><p>The first note I have from this act is just:</p><p>Whizzo \u2013&gt; Melting! (I think I am melting!)</p><p>My heart hurt when Albus chooses Delphi for the Cedric question, its such a betrayal of a perfect friend.</p><p>He GRINS at Albus then standing up for him over Delphi.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look upset at not being kissed. His Scorpius has an air of acceptance of who he is, and that\u2019s really cool.\u00a0</p><p><b>In front of Hogwarts:</b></p><p>Real -time notes:</p><p>He looks up at Hogwarts with such love. He smiles ahead, holding his hands still in front of him. Seems content.</p><p>When he speaks you can tell he\u2019s actually scared.

It looks like it would hurt, which was really cool.\u00a0</p><p>The concern on his face when Albus hurt himself was filled with such love.\u00a0</p><p>He then did something I haven\u2019t ever seen before (I don\u2019t think?). When Albus said they should keep away from each other he stared Harry down with a pretty angry face. I loved that.

                "content": "<p>I had the privilege of watching James Phoon play Scorpius this past Saturday. I know that I am one of the lucky few, so I tried to take as many notes as I could in the dark so I could give an accurate account of his interpretation. he showed so much character understanding, I hope this does his justice.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Act 1:</b></h2><p><b>Meeting train scene:</b></p><p>In general his Scorpius had a nervous disposition, not that I felt James was nervous, I actually felt quite at ease for a debut. His voice was&nbsp; a bit squeaky, but (I think) more that he was playing an 11 year old than he was going for squeaky? I may be wrong, but that how I saw it, as it didn&rsquo;t go on past year 4 to the same level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the train, he totally melts when he sees Rose. You know when you see someone really beautiful and your tummy flips? His body did that. it was the most adorable &ldquo;hi Rose&rdquo; ever. </p><p>I noted that he&rsquo;s was a tad slow on social uptake. It felt like he hadn&rsquo;t interacted with his peers before and that was wonderful.&nbsp;</p><p>An obviously he looked so, so cute (I wrote those actual words).</p><p>He sung the sweets song like a true Scorpius! Sing-songy and awkward but absolutely going for it.</p><p>He smiled away from Albus, towards the audience after he stays in the carriage for his sweets. </p><p><b>Year 1-4 sequence:</b></p><p>i read that he was happy but kinda indifferent about sorting into Slytherin. Sort of like&nbsp;&ldquo;yeah, of course&rdquo;.</p><p>He is properly infatuated face at Rose, like a puppy (I mean it&rsquo;s Leah, go figure). A super cute schoolboy crush, I actually loved it.</p><p>He looks really upset at the teasing, like he wants to help Albus but doesn&rsquo;t know how and it really bothers him.</p><p>During the scene after Scorpius&rsquo;s mothers death, he doesn&rsquo;t look at Albus until he asks him to come to the funeral, hes fidgety and looking away from him and. seems nervous about asking.I adored that.</p><p>&ldquo;Potters don&rsquo;t belong in Slytherin&rdquo; is the sweetest thing (not sure what I meant by that, but there you go). </p><p>He worked really well with Joe, particularly in this act.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Off the train:</b></p><p>He really thinks bread is a compliment and looked quite proud of himself.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen this done before, but he was genuinely confused by the first hug. Which makes the next line make a lot of sense.</p><p>Adorably, his face lights up at the mention of a quiz.</p><p>He has a sarcastic edge with Albus. He&rsquo;s learning how to school him at this point, but isn&rsquo;t able to take control. On the roof that &ldquo;something about you&rdquo; lin is wonderfully sassy.</p><p><b>St Oswalds:</b></p><p>He looks super lost with Amos and was really fidgety. You could tel, he felt out of place and wasn&rsquo;t sure what he was meant to be doing there.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Polyjuicing:</b></p><p>He was not over the top and it was beautiful, I&rsquo;ve missed introverted Scorpius with all my heart and the was it was still funny without pushing it gave me life.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Back out of bookcase:</b></p><p>When Scorpius is back to himself again he looks generally confused and a bit doomed.</p><p>There was lots of writhing on floor. Not a lot to explain there.</p><p>Body language: He generally fidgets with his hands but keeps his body still, like he&rsquo;s picking at his nails maybe. He holds his shoulders tensely like he&rsquo;s making himself smaller with his body language.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Act 2:</b></h2><p><b>Forest scene:</b></p><p>The first note I have from this act is just:</p><p>Whizzo &ndash;&gt; Melting! (I think I am melting!)</p><p>My heart hurt when Albus chooses Delphi for the Cedric question, its such a betrayal of a perfect friend.</p><p>He GRINS at Albus then standing up for him over Delphi.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t look upset at not being kissed. His Scorpius has an air of acceptance of who he is, and that&rsquo;s really cool.&nbsp;</p><p><b>In front of Hogwarts:</b></p><p>Real -time notes:</p><p>He looks up at Hogwarts with such love. He smiles ahead, holding his hands still in front of him. Seems content.</p><p>When he speaks you can tell he&rsquo;s actually scared. He&rsquo;s really vulnerable with Albus, more emotionally open than I&rsquo;ve seen for a while. He knows this character.</p><p><b>1st task:</b></p><p>He&rsquo;s actually shocked to see Hermione. Its adorable.&nbsp;</p><p>HIS FAKE ACCENT IS GOLD.</p><p>He&rsquo;s really into watching the task, he really isn&rsquo;t a lot of help to Albus.</p><p>When the time-turner starts spinning, he really moves his body with it. It looks like it would hurt, which was really cool.&nbsp;</p><p>The concern on his face when Albus hurt himself was filled with such love.&nbsp;</p><p>He then did something I haven&rsquo;t ever seen before (I don&rsquo;t think?). When Albus said they should keep away from each other he stared Harry down with a pretty angry face. I loved that. Such a cool thing to think about.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Staircase ballet</b> (an actual transcription of my notes):</p><p>He&rsquo;s happy, then quickly annoyed.</p><p>Has a blank, sad look.</p><p>Slight anger? Wow.&nbsp;</p><p>Disbelief at top of stairs, can&rsquo;t stop looking at Albus.</p><p>Falls to his knees as stairs turn.</p><p>Still full of hope.</p><p><b>Scorp/Delphi chat:</b></p><p>Comes in lying on the steps, as if he&rsquo;s been crying.</p><p>Realised his mistake of getting angry at the owls quickly, but there was a genuine flash of anger there.&nbsp;</p><p>When he asked&nbsp;&ldquo;to do what?&rdquo; he was actually begging for help.&nbsp;</p><p>Byt the end of this scene he looked hyped up and braver.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Library scene:</b></p><p>He&rsquo;s fired up as he enters, with forced self-assurance.&nbsp;</p><p>(Accidental hand hold)</p><p>He&rsquo;s really upset about what they&rsquo;ve done. Its clearly really affected him on top of Albus being awful.</p><p>He takes Albus&rsquo;s anger and just throws it back at him.&nbsp;</p><p>Great pacing with the speech, but that anger is so there and fits really well with this version of Scorpius.&nbsp;</p><p>After the cloak, he looks like he&rsquo;s questioning the VDM thing, which is super sad.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t linger on the Astoria lines (this is fair enough, and I think it works with the Scops that are angrier rather than upset in this scene).</p><p>Its like he doesn&rsquo;t care that he&rsquo;s being unreasonable. He deserves to have a rnt now. He&rsquo;s more angry than sad but upset about it. Constantly welling up.&nbsp;</p><p>When Albus says he&rsquo;s sorry he breaths again.&nbsp;</p><p>He eats up Albus&rsquo;s nice words and it was beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>He had a side grin and a teary face.&nbsp;</p><p>He stops before the hug and Joe has to encourage him into it. I like that he doesn&rsquo;t like physical contact, will make the hug in act 3 mean more.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Myrtle:</b></p><p>He was so trusting of Albus. I loved it.&nbsp;</p><p>He properly fangirled over Myrtle. Then a bit scared at the flirting. Then confused by her.&nbsp;</p><p>He giggled is the most adorable way at&nbsp;&ldquo;moderately partial to a Malfoy&hellip;&rdquo;.</p><p>Is like&nbsp;&ldquo;yeah Cedric was pretty, duh&rdquo;. Comfortable, subtle, queer Scorp is a thing of beauty and it was like coming home.</p><p>Looks excited at the adventure to come and really trusts Albus&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp;</p><p>(April mounts him.)</p><p><b>Out of the lake:</b></p><p>(Apparently I objectified him and noted that he was quite fit.)</p><p>He starts panicking after he&rsquo;s shouted Albus&rsquo;s name twice.</p><p>Then fear really sets in.&nbsp;</p><p>He seems to get whats going on from the way he says&nbsp;&ldquo;Harry Potters dead?&rdquo;. Its a realisation, not a question&nbsp;</p><p>Then hes just scared.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s really physical with the dementors which I thank.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Act 3:</b></h2><p><b>Umbridge&rsquo;s office:</b><br /></p><p>I feel like his Scorpius took her praise. That was really interesting, I loved that he really gets confidence from that.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s convincing. I think he would survive in the V world.&nbsp;</p><p>The first VDM and Valour scares him.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Polly:</b></p><p>I can only explain his face in this scene as confused.&nbsp;</p><p>He stutters the for V&amp;V here.</p><p><b>Office scene:</b></p><p>He is initially hopeful but thats crushed so quickly. Its heartbreaking.&nbsp;</p><p>He turns away while Draco is telling him of initially, like he&rsquo;s thinking about what to say next, and he&rsquo;s really strong when he replies.&nbsp;</p><p>He seems so shocked that his dad is violent. I need this from Scorpius&rsquo;s. its a really key moment and he aced it.&nbsp;</p><p>He clearly hates his family in this world. He basically spat the murky line.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s really strong in the last V&amp;V.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody has laughed at him this whole time. Its dead serious and its properly scary still. I really loved the atmosphere he created in the room.</p><p><b>Snape/ the campaign room:</b></p><p>He looked nervous about asking for help, but wasn&rsquo;t questioning his decision.&nbsp;</p><p>When he talks about the other world, he gets so excited. He smiled for the first time that act.&nbsp;</p><p>He seems to blindly trust Snape too. I loved the follower aspect to this Scorpius.&nbsp;</p><p>Hermione seems to actually scare him which was great. Still keeping up that mood of not being safe.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Patronus/the lake:</b></p><p>He turns to explain to Umbridge why he&rsquo;s there once she&rsquo;s made it clear she knows he&rsquo;s there.&nbsp;</p><p>He looks in awe of the patronuses beauty and doesn&rsquo;t seem at all shocked that it&rsquo;s a doe- his Scorpius reads a lot.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Out of the lake:</b></p><p>Kind of a shock that Albus appears- LOVE</p><p>There&rsquo;s a big hug and it&rsquo;s a big deal. I loved this so, so much.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Scorbus dorm scene:</b></p><p>He tiptoed really well, which I feel like I don&rsquo;t see enough.&nbsp;</p><p>He also looked like he loved scaring Albus which was playful and really cute, you get a glimpse of their normal friendship there.&nbsp;</p><p>HE DID THE SAMUEL B SHEET THING AT MOLDY VOLDY!</p><p>The whole tone he sets is that he&rsquo;s trying to reassure Albus that is isn&rsquo;t all his fault.&nbsp;</p><p>He was SO proud of the time turning line and not subtle about it.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Owlery:</b></p><p>He&rsquo;s a bit exasperated by Albus, like he just wants the job done.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t move for Delphi.&nbsp;</p><p>He realises who Delphi is as soon as she says who she was brought up by and is instantly scared again.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Torture scene:</b></p><p>He whimpers after he&rsquo;s tortures.
