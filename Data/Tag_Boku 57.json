I enjoy edm/hip hop dancing to unwind occasionally, work hard making cosplay/Etsy crafts to support myself, and love absurd/self-deprecating humor and making people laugh. I'm working on staying present to get out of my own head, and tend to Bakurage when around bad driving/stupidity. Touch starved but trepidatious about it.
