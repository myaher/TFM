He had forgiven him as a friend, but not as a boyfriend. Phil was beginning to wonder if Dan ever would</p><p>He was talking to Martyn and Sophie about it while they had coffee in the cafe. He sighed, \u201cI know what happened was, well, bad, but I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d stay mad.\u201d</p><p>Martyn shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do about it. Dan saw a list you made of everything you didn\u2019t like about him, I don\u2019t think you can do much to recover from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need to figure out how to say I\u2019m sorry in the right way. I need him.\u201d Phil looked at Martyn. \u201cI know I\u2019ve only known him for four months, but I am in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Martyn offered a small smile. \u201cMaybe just give it a little longer.\u201d</p><p>At that moment Dan was going in to join them, he smiled at Martyn and said hi, than gave Phil a small smile. Phil felt like his heart would burst if he had to see those deep dimples in those rosy cheeks one more time and he wasn\u2019t able to kiss them. Dan walked up to the counter to get a coffee and Phil turned to Martyn. \u201cI swear, someone has it in for me to keep him from me.\u201d</p><p>Sophie chimed in, finally wrapping up eating her muffin. \u201cIt will work out. It has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Phil asked her</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re lobsters, it has to.\u201d</p><p>Phil and Martyn looked at her confused, their eyebrows furrowing. \u201cWhat do you mean they\u2019re lobesters?\u201d Martyn asked, dumbfounded</p><p>\u201cLobsters find another lobster and mate for life.\u201d Sophie explained. \u201cIt\u2019s just a more creative way of saying you\u2019re soulmates.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded, he always admired how Sophie\u2019s mind worked. He turned around to look at Dan again and saw a guy talking to him. A guy who was tall, has big arms, clearly very fit, and very handsome. He saw them laughing and Dan had a blush on his cheeks</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh.\u201d Phil said, turning to Martyn and Sophie. \u201cThat guy is attacking him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It was Sophie\u2019s turn to be confused with Martyn. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re flirting.\u201d</p><p>Phil turned around and saw Dan laugh and put his hand on the guys chest. Phil turned back around and said, \u201cNo, see how Dan is pushing him away and he won\u2019t back off, I gotta go help him!\u201d</p><p>As Phil stood Martyn grabbed his hand and said, \u201cDo you think that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Phil pulled away and quickly thought of a plan. As he got there, he tapped on Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey Dan, my name is Phil, I\u2019m the one who messaged you on Tinder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Dan\u2019s smile fell from his face</p><p>Phil ignored Dan and looked at the guy. \u201cOh I know you said you talked to a few guys all at once but this guy is impressive!\u201d</p><p>The guy scratched his back and he looked at Dan, who was trying to explain, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d The guy cut Dan off. \u201cI\u2019m going to go. You can call me if you want.\u201d</p><p>As the guy left, Dan said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have your number.\u201d</p><p>The guy ignored him and left the cafe. Phil smiled at Dan, who was frowning at him, and cluelessly said, \u201cYour welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved me from what? The attractive, funny guy?\u201d Dan was very upset</p><p>\u201cWell from where I was, it looked like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it looked like to you!\u201d Dan said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not yours to save.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut were lobsters.\u201d Phil responded, explaining, \u201cSophie said that we\u2019re lobsters because they find someone and they mate for life.\u201d</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t care what Sophie thinks, we are not going to happen, accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that what?\u201d Phil asked, not understanding</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dan looked Phil in the eyes. \u201c<i>Accept </i>that.\u201d</p><p>Phil felt his heart fall. \u201cOh.\u201d He awkwardly stepped away and said, \u201cSorry I ruined your conversation.\u201d And quietly went back home.</p><p>-</p><p>Later that night everyone was over Martyn\u2019s apartment. While things with Dan and Phil were a little awkward, everyone was having fun. At one pint during the night Cornelia found a tape on top of Martyns tv. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d She asked Martyn, who shrugged and told her to pop it in. Everyone gathered around the tv except for Phil, who was in the fridge getting a drink</p><p>As the video started they all knew what it was. \u201cThis is us getting ready for Vidcon!\u201d</p><p>Phil turned around with his eyes wide. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to watch this.\u201d</p><p>Everyone ignored him saying it would be fun. Phil sighed and stood behind the couch. It went through all of them getting ready and Dan crying when Eric was late. Suddenly, the video turned as Martyn talked to Phil saying, \u201cYou should take Dan to Vidcon.\u201d</p><p>The video continues with Phil shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d As the camera panned back to Dan who clearly very upset as he cried at that point. Martyn turned back to Phil. \u201cHe\u2019s crying, he\u2019s heartbroken, you don\u2019t have to do anything, just go with him.\u201d</p><p>Dan watched the video with a confused look. He had no idea that this happened. He was wondering why Phil never told him</p><p>Phil in the video nodded. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go to your room and get some something to wear.\u201d</p><p>As Martyn and Phil went to another hotel room to get Phil something to wear, Phil said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to watch the rest-\u201c</p><p>Once again everyone told him it would be fun, but really they were all curious as to what would happen. \u201cFine, But I\u2019m not going to watch.\u201d Phil turned and headed for the door. Dan watched the rest of the video with his eyebrows furrowed as he was confused</p><p>Martyn filmed Phil come out in a nice, blue button up and clean fitted jeans, looking stunning. \u201cOkay let\u2019s go get your damsel in distress.\u201d Martyn jokes but as he peaked the door open a tiny bit, he saw Dan with his date. He turned to see that Phil saw too, and his face looked heart broken</p><p>Phil watched the video by the door as he turned away. Dan watched, shocked and tears filling up in his eyes. Dan eyes turned to the floor and he stared at it, thoughts going through his head</p><p>As the video was cut off, Cornelia turned around to look at Phil. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d</p><p>Everyone but Dan turned and looked at Phil. Phil shrugged, quietly saying, \u201cYeah, well&hellip;..\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up from the floor to Phil, his eyes glossy with tears. He walked over to Phil, a pout on his lips. When he got to Phil, he put his hands on Phil\u2019s cheeks and connected his lips to Phil\u2019s</p><p>Phil was kissing Dan back very quickly. Everyone else watched smiling at them. As they pulled away, Dan smiled at Phil and hugged him. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan too, both of them feeling their hearts fill up for the other</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Sophie said to the others, happily. \u201cThey\u2019re lobsters!\u201d</p>",

As he got there, he tapped on Dan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey Dan, my name is Phil, I\u2019m the one who messaged you on Tinder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Dan\u2019s smile fell from his face</p><p>Phil ignored Dan and looked at the guy. \u201cOh I know you said you talked to a few guys all at once but this guy is impressive!\u201d</p><p>The guy scratched his back and he looked at Dan, who was trying to explain, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d The guy cut Dan off. \u201cI\u2019m going to go. You can call me if you want.\u201d</p><p>As the guy left, Dan said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have your number.\u201d</p><p>The guy ignored him and left the cafe. Phil smiled at Dan, who was frowning at him, and cluelessly said, \u201cYour welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved me from what? The attractive, funny guy?\u201d Dan was very upset</p><p>\u201cWell from where I was, it looked like-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it looked like to you!\u201d Dan said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not yours to save.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut were lobsters.\u201d Phil responded, explaining, \u201cSophie said that we\u2019re lobsters because they find someone and they mate for life.\u201d</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t care what Sophie thinks, we are not going to happen, accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that what?\u201d Phil asked, not understanding</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dan looked Phil in the eyes. \u201c<i>Accept </i>that.\u201d</p><p>Phil felt his heart fall. \u201cOh.\u201d He awkwardly stepped away and said, \u201cSorry I ruined your conversation.\u201d And quietly went back home.</p><p>-</p><p>Later that night everyone was over Martyn\u2019s apartment. While things with Dan and Phil were a little awkward, everyone was having fun. At one pint during the night Cornelia found a tape on top of Martyns tv. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d She asked Martyn, who shrugged and told her to pop it in. Everyone gathered around the tv except for Phil, who was in the fridge getting a drink</p><p>As the video started they all knew what it was. \u201cThis is us getting ready for Vidcon!\u201d</p><p>Phil turned around with his eyes wide. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to watch this.\u201d</p><p>Everyone ignored him saying it would be fun. Phil sighed and stood behind the couch. It went through all of them getting ready and Dan crying when Eric was late. Suddenly, the video turned as Martyn talked to Phil saying, \u201cYou should take Dan to Vidcon.\u201d</p><p>The video continues with Phil shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d As the camera panned back to Dan who clearly very upset as he cried at that point. Martyn turned back to Phil. \u201cHe\u2019s crying, he\u2019s heartbroken, you don\u2019t have to do anything, just go with him.\u201d</p><p>Dan watched the video with a confused look. He had no idea that this happened. He was wondering why Phil never told him</p><p>Phil in the video nodded. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go to your room and get some something to wear.\u201d</p><p>As Martyn and Phil went to another hotel room to get Phil something to wear, Phil said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to watch the rest-\u201c</p><p>Once again everyone told him it would be fun, but really they were all curious as to what would happen. \u201cFine, But I\u2019m not going to watch.\u201d Phil turned and headed for the door. Dan watched the rest of the video with his eyebrows furrowed as he was confused</p><p>Martyn filmed Phil come out in a nice, blue button up and clean fitted jeans, looking stunning. \u201cOkay let\u2019s go get your damsel in distress.\u201d Martyn jokes but as he peaked the door open a tiny bit, he saw Dan with his date. He turned to see that Phil saw too, and his face looked heart broken</p><p>Phil watched the video by the door as he turned away. Dan watched, shocked and tears filling up in his eyes. Dan eyes turned to the floor and he stared at it, thoughts going through his head</p><p>As the video was cut off, Cornelia turned around to look at Phil. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d</p><p>Everyone but Dan turned and looked at Phil. Phil shrugged, quietly saying, \u201cYeah, well\u2026..\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up from the floor to Phil, his eyes glossy with tears. He walked over to Phil, a pout on his lips. When he got to Phil, he put his hands on Phil\u2019s cheeks and connected his lips to Phil\u2019s</p><p>Phil was kissing Dan back very quickly. Everyone else watched smiling at them. As they pulled away, Dan smiled at Phil and hugged him. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan too, both of them feeling their hearts fill up for the other</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Sophie said to the others, happily. \u201cThey\u2019re lobsters!\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Just Friends</h1><p>Summary: Based on the show Friends!</p><p>Chapter 10- The Chapter With The Vidcon Video</p><p>Two months had gone by, and Dan still hadn&rsquo;t forgiven Phil. He had forgiven him as a friend, but not as a boyfriend. Phil was beginning to wonder if Dan ever would</p><p>He was talking to Martyn and Sophie about it while they had coffee in the cafe. He sighed, &ldquo;I know what happened was, well, bad, but I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d stay mad.&rdquo;</p><p>Martyn shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much you can do about it. Dan saw a list you made of everything you didn&rsquo;t like about him, I don&rsquo;t think you can do much to recover from that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I need to figure out how to say I&rsquo;m sorry in the right way. I need him.&rdquo; Phil looked at Martyn. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve only known him for four months, but I am in love with him.&rdquo;</p><p>Martyn offered a small smile. &ldquo;Maybe just give it a little longer.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment Dan was going in to join them, he smiled at Martyn and said hi, than gave Phil a small smile. Phil felt like his heart would burst if he had to see those deep dimples in those rosy cheeks one more time and he wasn&rsquo;t able to kiss them. Dan walked up to the counter to get a coffee and Phil turned to Martyn. &ldquo;I swear, someone has it in for me to keep him from me.&rdquo;</p><p>Sophie chimed in, finally wrapping up eating her muffin. &ldquo;It will work out. It has to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Phil asked her</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re lobsters, it has to.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil and Martyn looked at her confused, their eyebrows furrowing. &ldquo;What do you mean they&rsquo;re lobesters?&rdquo; Martyn asked, dumbfounded</p><p>&ldquo;Lobsters find another lobster and mate for life.&rdquo; Sophie explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a more creative way of saying you&rsquo;re soulmates.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded, he always admired how Sophie&rsquo;s mind worked. He turned around to look at Dan again and saw a guy talking to him. A guy who was tall, has big arms, clearly very fit, and very handsome. He saw them laughing and Dan had a blush on his cheeks</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my gosh.&rdquo; Phil said, turning to Martyn and Sophie. &ldquo;That guy is attacking him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; It was Sophie&rsquo;s turn to be confused with Martyn. &ldquo;It seems like they&rsquo;re flirting.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil turned around and saw Dan laugh and put his hand on the guys chest.

Phil makes a non-committal noise from under the duvet, squirming around until he can press his face into Dan\u2019s jean-clad thigh.

The weeks post-tour had left them both a bit on edge, a bit tetchy with themselves and with each other.

But it\u2019s <i>early,</i> the sky barely lightened as Phil finally pushes himself upright against the pillows. Dan runs his palms over sleep-warmed skin as Phil clambers easily into his lap, not even bothering with his glasses.

Their home, with all its little comforts and turbulences.</p><p>Phil turns his head, presses his lips against Dan\u2019s jaw in a not-quite kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d he says.</p><p>Dan, who is maybe still a little bit fond even through all his tetchiness, says, \u201cYou won\u2019t, you\u2019ll have a lie-in and eat a takeaway in your pants and pile up all the blankets in the middle of the bed without my dumb brain to ruin any of it for you.\u201d He keeps his tone light and joking but can practically feel Phil\u2019s expression sour against his shoulder.</p><p>Phil pulls back to look at him, but Dan just leans forward in order to avoid the full weight of his gaze.

Maybe he\u2019s a lot fond. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>The rising sun\u2019s got nothing on Phil\u2019s smile, not when he\u2019s pressing into Dan and kissing him soundly. \u201cLove you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you most,\u201d Dan says into the kiss, rolling his eyes even as he indulges Phil with the sappy back-and-forth.

He\u2019s really going to miss his train at this rate. \u201cLove you most-est,\u201d he says, pinching Dan\u2019s side and trying to suppress his grin.</p><p>Dan dumps his giggling boyfriend out of his lap, accompanied by a drawn-out <i>Phil-il </i>for good measure.
