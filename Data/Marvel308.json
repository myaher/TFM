Captain America as your next door neighbor came with some perks. You always felt safe in your apartment building, but now, you seemed to have a feeling of calm. \u00a0Something about being able to take down an alien invasion made cat burglars seem less scary. \u00a0Steve was an exceptionally generous neighbor, and it would have been very easy to take advantage of his kindness. \u00a0He regularly volunteered to walk with you and your girls after dark, pick up things like coffee and bagels while he was out, and keep an eye on you now and then during your early-morning walks (from afar, obviously, since your walking speed and his running speed were far from compatible.) \u00a0\u00a0Both of you tried to respectfully observe the friend/neighbor-of-the-opposite-sex boundary. \u00a0He always asked if he was \u201cnosing around\u201d too much, you always checked in when you or the girls had knocked a few too many times on his door. \u00a0It felt like a friendly and equitable give-and-take, except when it came to school fundraisers.</p><!-- more --><p>Steve had a big heart and a wicked sweet tooth, and every single teenage occupant and visitor to your apartment took full advantage of it. \u00a0After hitting him up for the third week in a row for yet another fundraiser, you suggested to your older daughter that maybe there was something nice you could do for Mr. Rogers in return, as a way of thanking him for his constant support. \u00a0She took the suggestion to heart and volunteered to water his plants when he was away.</p><p>\u201cMom, I asked Mr. Rogers if he needed someone to water his plants while he was away. \u00a0I noticed his always look droopy and sad. \u00a0He said wasn\u2019t sure because he wanted you to tell him if it was ok before he said yes. \u00a0So? Yes?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You knocked on his door rather than text him - it was just faster - as he said, his texting was slow \u00a0due to his \u201cbig thumbs.\u201d \u00a0He smiled when he answered, with his ear to his phone. \u00a0</p><p>You mouthed, \u201cSORRY, LATER\u201d and turned around. \u00a0He grabbed your forearm, shook his head, and said, \u201cone minute,\u201d while raising his eyebrows and sweeping his arm towards his apartment, wordlessly asking you to come in. \u00a0As you sat at his kitchen table, he wrapped up his phone call.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Steve, didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. \u00a0What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie told me she volunteered to water your plants when you were away after she extorted you to buy more candy from her. \u00a0I think she felt a bit sheepish asking you again, but I believe the offer was sincere - she described your plants as \u201cdroopy and sad.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head and started to chuckle. \u00a0\u201cThat bad, huh? She\u2019s such a sweetheart. \u00a0That would be fine, but I told her you had to approve before I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine with me, as long as you\u2019re ok with us having a key to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my own little background check, and all signs point to a completely trustworthy family. \u00a0I\u2019ll drop the key by tonight, show her all the plants, and find some way to tell you when I leave, so she\u2019ll know when to come around. \u00a0Sound ok?\u201d</p><p>He had accepted your offer of joining you for dinner, so you were expecting the knock at the door. \u00a0Lizzie and Gabbi raced each other to the door and threw it open, shouting \u201cMr. Rogers!\u201d in unison and smiling ear-to-ear. \u00a0Gabbi pulled him by the hand to the table and pulled out the chair that was slowly becoming his. \u00a0He put a small bouquet of flowers on the table and sat down with a smile. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for having me, ladies. \u00a0I don\u2019t cook that much for myself.\u201d \u00a0The girls started talking at the same time, both offering some version of how he was welcome any time. </p><p>Steve looked to you, and you nodded, \u201cOf course, anytime.\u201d</p><p>The talk at dinner centered around the plant watering process, and the responsibility that came with having a key to another person\u2019s home. \u00a0As the heavy, you of course had to lay down the rules about how this was going to work. \u00a0Both girls listened soberly and agreed to the few conditions, including never using the key without an adult knowing. \u00a0It made you proud to see them so sincere about something as simple as watering a neighbor\u2019s plants. \u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t keep the small smile off his face as he watched your little family figure out how they could help him, and, as Gabbi offered, \u201cany pets you might want to get,\u201d a suggestion which her older sister heartily endorsed. \u00a0You did not attempt to hide your less-than-thrilled reaction.</p><p>After dinner and cleanup was done, the girls were practically bouncing off the walls as they got their suitcases and stuff ready for their nights at their Dad\u2019s. \u00a0Not only were they staying three nights, they were going to see \u201cWicked\u201d on Broadway - a gift from their Dad and his girlfriend for both their birthdays. \u00a0You sent them on their way with hugs, kisses, and requests to send you pictures. \u00a0When you got back upstairs, Steve\u2019s apartment door was open and he yelled from inside.</p><p>\u201cHey, want a drink or some dessert? \u00a0Least I could do after that delicious dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am the queen of delicious spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0It&rsquo;s on my business card.\u201d You always made yourself smile. </p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d love something. \u00a0Want me to come here or you coming to me?\u201d</p><p>It may have sounded suggestive, but it wasn\u2019t meant that way. \u00a0You were always aware of Steve - his identities, his blue-green eyes, and that megawatt smile that could melt tungsten - you were a heterosexual woman, after all - but you didn\u2019t want to risk this friendship or look like an idiot by testing the romantic waters. \u00a0</p><p>Steve wasn\u2019t interested in you that way anyway, never having given you the slightest indication of wanting anything more than a platonic friendship. \u00a0You could only imagine that his ideal girl would look like a 1940\u2019s pinup or a sleek and lethal weapon, not a generously-sized woman of substance with lumps, bumps, and plenty of hips and ass to grab onto. \u00a0You were truly happy with yourself, but realistic about who might find that same happiness with you. </p><p>Dessert can just be dessert.</p><p>The evening ended perfectly. \u00a0Coffee with Bailey\u2019s, delicious dessert from the corner bakery, \u00a0and talking about anything and everything. \u00a0His work, your work, your love of World War II history and his first-hand experience with it. \u00a0After gently shaking you awake after falling asleep on his couch, you sleepily asked if he\u2019d like to join you and some friends from work for a night out tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just grabbing a quick bite then I think a movie. \u00a0Want to come? It\u2019s gotten really good reviews - looks funny. \u00a0There\u2019ll only be a few of us, and they are probably as clueless about your day job as I was. \u00a0If they\u2019re not, they are very discreet.\u201d</p><p>As he showed you to the door, three steps away, \u201cSounds great, thanks. \u00a0If nothing comes up for work, I\u2019ll be there. \u2018Night Stephanie\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, I have a favor to ask. \u00a0I know myself. \u00a0There is no way I am going to want to get up and \u00a0walk tomorrow, and of course you\u2019ll be running, because you would even if you\u2019d just been discharged from the hospital. \u00a0Would you mind knocking on my door before you leave? \u00a0That way, I\u2019ll have to get out of bed and that\u2019s the biggest hurdle. I\u2019d really appreciate it, even though you\u2019ll see me looking like a zombie.\u201d \u00a0He agreed and you soon were asleep.</p><p>Your alarm going off was not sufficient to get you out of bed, as you suspected. \u00a0Though you were a light sleeper, it appeared that the late night, along with the Bailey\u2019s, helped you also sleep through Steve\u2019s knocks. \u00a0When you heard your phone ring, you pried your eyes open and answered, \u201cHey lady, I\u2019ve been knocking for 5 minutes. \u00a0You alive in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Steve, in fact I am not. \u00a0Thanks so much for doing exactly what I asked you to. \u00a0I really appreciate it. \u00a0Enjoy your run.\u201d</p><p>All you heard was laughing as he started to bang on the door again AND press the doorbell. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop until you answer the door.\u201d </p><p>Why, oh why, did you ask the most diligent and responsible man on Earth to get you up? (Because you knew he would.). \u00a0</p><p>After throwing your phone into the pillow, you jumped out of bed, made sure your pajamas covered what needed covering, and put a headband on before throwing the door open with what must have been a sinister look. \u00a0</p><p>He was smiling ear-to-ear, looking generally mischievous and laughing, which only got louder when he saw your face. \u00a0You forgot that he dealt with real sinister all the time. \u00a0He could handle your version.</p><p>\u201cWell, you did what I asked with fidelity. \u00a0LOUDLY, but as I asked. \u00a0Thanks Steve, enjoy your run. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry I made you have a late start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m waiting for you to come with me.\u201d The look on your face was intended to scare him away. \u00a0Nope. \u00a0He was loving this torture. \u00a0You closed the door in his face as you went to get dressed, and heard him roar with laughter. \u00a0Finally, a real smile *may* have crossed your face. \u00a0</p><p>When you opened the door, ready to go, he acted as nothing had happened. \u00a0That you hadn\u2019t just been a complete pain in the ass baby and gotten mad at him for something YOU asked HIM to do. \u00a0To HELP YOU. \u00a0You weren\u2019t ready to give him the satisfaction of winning (immature, much?) so you didn\u2019t look at him, put in your earbuds and blasted your music. \u00a0</p><p>He did not stop smiling. \u00a0When you got outside, you went your own separate ways. \u00a0When you finished the 5K loop, you felt great, of course. \u00a0You also felt stupid, of course. \u00a0As you walked to get some coffee, you saw him sitting on the bench in front of the cafe, smiling with that shit-eating grin of his. \u00a0You had to laugh. \u00a0Hard.</p><p>Better get the apology over with. \u00a0\u201cSorry. \u00a0I acted like a jerk. \u00a0You did what I asked you to do and, no surprise, I hated it. \u00a0Thanks for sticking with me and getting me outside. \u00a0I appreciate it. \u00a0Can I buy you a coffee to apologize and say thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne coffee for both apologizing and thanking? \u00a0That doesn\u2019t seem quite fair, but ok.\u201d \u00a0You were getting used to the smart-ass version of his smile. You were grateful that you didn\u2019t have to belabor the point. \u00a0</p><p>Sometimes a guy friend is exactly what an over-talker and thinker like you needs. \u00a0You got your coffee, walked back in companionable silence, and went your separate ways, with promises to text about the movie/dinner thing that night.</p><p>\u201cWhen and where are we meeting tonight? What should I wear? Can I bring someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201c6:30, in front of your door, and whatever you would usually wear to the movies, and of course! See you then.\u201d</p><p>You had been colleagues and then friends with Maria, Ally, and Jen for over 10 years. \u00a0You loved them. \u00a0They had your back professionally and personally, and they were some of the best people you knew. \u00a0</p><p>Maria had also brought her brother Sam. \u00a0With you, Steve, and his friend James \u201cno-one-calls-me-that-call-me-Bucky, \u201d the group was just big enough. \u00a0Dinner was relaxed, without much specific discussion of Steve and Bucky\u2019s work or long history, with minimal interference from you. \u00a0</p><p>Steve was really good at getting people to talk about themselves, and this group didn\u2019t need much encouragement to talk about their passions of working with students with special needs. \u00a0You had never met Sam before, but from the way he described his job as a school counselor, he clearly loved the work. \u00a0</p><p>The movie was a new twist on the buddy genre. \u00a0You laughed hysterically and fielded the silent buzz of text announcements from the Maria, Ally, and Jen throughout.</p><p><b>Maria: </b>Holy geez, HE is the \u201cnice neighbor\u201d you\u2019ve been talking about?<br/></p><p><b>Ally:</b> Yeah, really Steph, the best description you could give was \u201cnice neighbor?\u201d</p><p><b>Jen: </b>How about \u201cadonis\u201d or \u201cthe most beautiful man you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d Those might have come close to describing him. \u00a0His friend is also smoking hot.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> HELL YEAH</p><p><b>Ally:</b> WOOOOOOO HOOOOOO</p><p><b>Steph:</b> STOP IT. \u00a02 of you are MARRIED WOMEN. \u00a0Yes, he\u2019s beautiful, but he\u2019s also really nice. \u00a0I knew you\u2019d all pester mercilessly if I went into detail, so I just glossed over it.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> So spill. \u00a0What\u2019s going on with you two? \u00a0Is this a thing?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Absolutely not. \u00a0I am totally aware of his physique (DONT YOU DARE GIVE ME SHIT ABOUT THT WORDING), but I am also totally aware that he has never given any inclination that he\u2019s interested in being anything more than friends, and I am REALLY fine with that.</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Can we PLEASE talk about this ltr? I want to watch the movie and all this texting is embarrassing.</p><p><b>Ally:</b> No, I don\u2019t think it is.</p><p><b>Jen: </b>I second Ally</p><p><b>Maria:</b> \u00a0Fine, we\u2019ll talk later. \u00a0So, what do you guys think of my brother? \u00a0Cute, huh?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> \u00a0I\u2019m turning off my phone. \u00a0You guys are hopeless. \u00a0I love you all to death, but you\u2019re hopeless.</p><p>The night ended with a cab for your friends and Sam, an unofficial agreement to get together again, and an extremely self-aware walk home with you between two huge, hulking men. \u00a0Bucky was quiet, but smiling, and you and Steve were going back and forth about the movie.<br/></p><p>\u201cThere is no way that that car would have flipped like that in real life. \u00a0No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, ok, and what percentage of movie patrons would have the first-hand experience to know and refute that special effect? I liked it, it was nice to just laugh and give your brain a rest.</p><p>You were too tired for a night cap, so you wished them both a good night, shaking Bucky\u2019s hand, and giving Steve a peck on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt was really fun tonight. \u00a0Thank you both for coming - you definitely made it better. \u00a0Hope to see you soon Bucky and see you tomorrow Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to wake you up again? I\u2019d be happy to.\u201d You both laughed as you saw the confused smirk on Bucky\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. \u00a0I don\u2019t think our friendship could survive another morning like today. \u00a0I don\u2019t need another opportunity to look like a complete ass, but thanks for the offer.\u201d</p><p>As you closed the door, Steve and Bucky looked at each other. \u00a0As they went inside, Bucky finally had reason to speak.</p><p>\u201cI know that look, punk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and what look is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, jerk. \u00a0We are friends, nothing more. \u00a0She\u2019s a really great person - smart and funny, and her kids are just the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you don\u2019t like her, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if I do or don\u2019t, she has never given me any signs that she was interested that way. \u00a0We live next door to each other, I don\u2019t want to try something and have it be awkward after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever took you for a coward, punk.\u201d</p><h2><b><a href=\"http://stevieang.tumblr.com/post/176270859745/you-cant-hurry-love-chapter-430\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a></b></h2>",

Captain America as your next door neighbor came with some perks. You always felt safe in your apartment building, but now, you seemed to have a feeling of calm. \u00a0Something about being able to take down an alien invasion made cat burglars seem less scary. \u00a0Steve was an exceptionally generous neighbor, and it would have been very easy to take advantage of his kindness. \u00a0He regularly volunteered to walk with you and your girls after dark, pick up things like coffee and bagels while he was out, and keep an eye on you now and then during your early-morning walks (from afar, obviously, since your walking speed and his running speed were far from compatible.) \u00a0\u00a0Both of you tried to respectfully observe the friend/neighbor-of-the-opposite-sex boundary. \u00a0He always asked if he was \u201cnosing around\u201d too much, you always checked in when you or the girls had knocked a few too many times on his door. \u00a0It felt like a friendly and equitable give-and-take, except when it came to school fundraisers.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Steve had a big heart and a wicked sweet tooth, and every single teenage occupant and visitor to your apartment took full advantage of it. \u00a0After hitting him up for the third week in a row for yet another fundraiser, you suggested to your older daughter that maybe there was something nice you could do for Mr. Rogers in return, as a way of thanking him for his constant support. \u00a0She took the suggestion to heart and volunteered to water his plants when he was away.</p><p>\u201cMom, I asked Mr. Rogers if he needed someone to water his plants while he was away. \u00a0I noticed his always look droopy and sad. \u00a0He said wasn\u2019t sure because he wanted you to tell him if it was ok before he said yes. \u00a0So? Yes?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You knocked on his door rather than text him - it was just faster - as he said, his texting was slow \u00a0due to his \u201cbig thumbs.\u201d \u00a0He smiled when he answered, with his ear to his phone. \u00a0</p><p>You mouthed, \u201cSORRY, LATER\u201d and turned around. \u00a0He grabbed your forearm, shook his head, and said, \u201cone minute,\u201d while raising his eyebrows and sweeping his arm towards his apartment, wordlessly asking you to come in. \u00a0As you sat at his kitchen table, he wrapped up his phone call.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Steve, didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. \u00a0What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie told me she volunteered to water your plants when you were away after she extorted you to buy more candy from her. \u00a0I think she felt a bit sheepish asking you again, but I believe the offer was sincere - she described your plants as \u201cdroopy and sad.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head and started to chuckle. \u00a0\u201cThat bad, huh? She\u2019s such a sweetheart. \u00a0That would be fine, but I told her you had to approve before I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine with me, as long as you\u2019re ok with us having a key to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my own little background check, and all signs point to a completely trustworthy family. \u00a0I\u2019ll drop the key by tonight, show her all the plants, and find some way to tell you when I leave, so she\u2019ll know when to come around. \u00a0Sound ok?\u201d</p><p>He had accepted your offer of joining you for dinner, so you were expecting the knock at the door. \u00a0Lizzie and Gabbi raced each other to the door and threw it open, shouting \u201cMr. Rogers!\u201d in unison and smiling ear-to-ear. \u00a0Gabbi pulled him by the hand to the table and pulled out the chair that was slowly becoming his. \u00a0He put a small bouquet of flowers on the table and sat down with a smile. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for having me, ladies. \u00a0I don\u2019t cook that much for myself.\u201d \u00a0The girls started talking at the same time, both offering some version of how he was welcome any time. </p><p>Steve looked to you, and you nodded, \u201cOf course, anytime.\u201d</p><p>The talk at dinner centered around the plant watering process, and the responsibility that came with having a key to another person\u2019s home. \u00a0As the heavy, you of course had to lay down the rules about how this was going to work. \u00a0Both girls listened soberly and agreed to the few conditions, including never using the key without an adult knowing. \u00a0It made you proud to see them so sincere about something as simple as watering a neighbor\u2019s plants. \u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t keep the small smile off his face as he watched your little family figure out how they could help him, and, as Gabbi offered, \u201cany pets you might want to get,\u201d a suggestion which her older sister heartily endorsed. \u00a0You did not attempt to hide your less-than-thrilled reaction.</p><p>After dinner and cleanup was done, the girls were practically bouncing off the walls as they got their suitcases and stuff ready for their nights at their Dad\u2019s. \u00a0Not only were they staying three nights, they were going to see \u201cWicked\u201d on Broadway - a gift from their Dad and his girlfriend for both their birthdays. \u00a0You sent them on their way with hugs, kisses, and requests to send you pictures. \u00a0When you got back upstairs, Steve\u2019s apartment door was open and he yelled from inside.</p><p>\u201cHey, want a drink or some dessert? \u00a0Least I could do after that delicious dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am the queen of delicious spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0It\u2019s on my business card.\u201d You always made yourself smile. </p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d love something. \u00a0Want me to come here or you coming to me?\u201d</p><p>It may have sounded suggestive, but it wasn\u2019t meant that way. \u00a0You were always aware of Steve - his identities, his blue-green eyes, and that megawatt smile that could melt tungsten - you were a heterosexual woman, after all - but you didn\u2019t want to risk this friendship or look like an idiot by testing the romantic waters. \u00a0</p><p>Steve wasn\u2019t interested in you that way anyway, never having given you the slightest indication of wanting anything more than a platonic friendship. \u00a0You could only imagine that his ideal girl would look like a 1940\u2019s pinup or a sleek and lethal weapon, not a generously-sized woman of substance with lumps, bumps, and plenty of hips and ass to grab onto. \u00a0You were truly happy with yourself, but realistic about who might find that same happiness with you. </p><p>Dessert can just be dessert.</p><p>The evening ended perfectly. \u00a0Coffee with Bailey\u2019s, delicious dessert from the corner bakery, \u00a0and talking about anything and everything. \u00a0His work, your work, your love of World War II history and his first-hand experience with it. \u00a0After gently shaking you awake after falling asleep on his couch, you sleepily asked if he\u2019d like to join you and some friends from work for a night out tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just grabbing a quick bite then I think a movie. \u00a0Want to come? It\u2019s gotten really good reviews - looks funny. \u00a0There\u2019ll only be a few of us, and they are probably as clueless about your day job as I was. \u00a0If they\u2019re not, they are very discreet.\u201d</p><p>As he showed you to the door, three steps away, \u201cSounds great, thanks. \u00a0If nothing comes up for work, I\u2019ll be there. \u2018Night Stephanie\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, I have a favor to ask. \u00a0I know myself. \u00a0There is no way I am going to want to get up and \u00a0walk tomorrow, and of course you\u2019ll be running, because you would even if you\u2019d just been discharged from the hospital. \u00a0Would you mind knocking on my door before you leave? \u00a0That way, I\u2019ll have to get out of bed and that\u2019s the biggest hurdle. I\u2019d really appreciate it, even though you\u2019ll see me looking like a zombie.\u201d \u00a0He agreed and you soon were asleep.</p><p>Your alarm going off was not sufficient to get you out of bed, as you suspected. \u00a0Though you were a light sleeper, it appeared that the late night, along with the Bailey\u2019s, helped you also sleep through Steve\u2019s knocks. \u00a0When you heard your phone ring, you pried your eyes open and answered, \u201cHey lady, I\u2019ve been knocking for 5 minutes. \u00a0You alive in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Steve, in fact I am not. \u00a0Thanks so much for doing exactly what I asked you to. \u00a0I really appreciate it. \u00a0Enjoy your run.\u201d</p><p>All you heard was laughing as he started to bang on the door again AND press the doorbell. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop until you answer the door.\u201d </p><p>Why, oh why, did you ask the most diligent and responsible man on Earth to get you up? (Because you knew he would.). \u00a0</p><p>After throwing your phone into the pillow, you jumped out of bed, made sure your pajamas covered what needed covering, and put a headband on before throwing the door open with what must have been a sinister look. \u00a0</p><p>He was smiling ear-to-ear, looking generally mischievous and laughing, which only got louder when he saw your face. \u00a0You forgot that he dealt with real sinister all the time. \u00a0He could handle your version.</p><p>\u201cWell, you did what I asked with fidelity. \u00a0LOUDLY, but as I asked. \u00a0Thanks Steve, enjoy your run. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry I made you have a late start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m waiting for you to come with me.\u201d The look on your face was intended to scare him away. \u00a0Nope. \u00a0He was loving this torture. \u00a0You closed the door in his face as you went to get dressed, and heard him roar with laughter. \u00a0Finally, a real smile *may* have crossed your face. \u00a0</p><p>When you opened the door, ready to go, he acted as nothing had happened. \u00a0That you hadn\u2019t just been a complete pain in the ass baby and gotten mad at him for something YOU asked HIM to do. \u00a0To HELP YOU. \u00a0You weren\u2019t ready to give him the satisfaction of winning (immature, much?) so you didn\u2019t look at him, put in your earbuds and blasted your music. \u00a0</p><p>He did not stop smiling. \u00a0When you got outside, you went your own separate ways. \u00a0When you finished the 5K loop, you felt great, of course. \u00a0You also felt stupid, of course. \u00a0As you walked to get some coffee, you saw him sitting on the bench in front of the cafe, smiling with that shit-eating grin of his. \u00a0You had to laugh. \u00a0Hard.</p><p>Better get the apology over with. \u00a0\u201cSorry. \u00a0I acted like a jerk. \u00a0You did what I asked you to do and, no surprise, I hated it. \u00a0Thanks for sticking with me and getting me outside. \u00a0I appreciate it. \u00a0Can I buy you a coffee to apologize and say thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne coffee for both apologizing and thanking? \u00a0That doesn\u2019t seem quite fair, but ok.\u201d \u00a0You were getting used to the smart-ass version of his smile. You were grateful that you didn\u2019t have to belabor the point. \u00a0</p><p>Sometimes a guy friend is exactly what an over-talker and thinker like you needs. \u00a0You got your coffee, walked back in companionable silence, and went your separate ways, with promises to text about the movie/dinner thing that night.</p><p>\u201cWhen and where are we meeting tonight? What should I wear? Can I bring someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201c6:30, in front of your door, and whatever you would usually wear to the movies, and of course! See you then.\u201d</p><p>You had been colleagues and then friends with Maria, Ally, and Jen for over 10 years. \u00a0You loved them. \u00a0They had your back professionally and personally, and they were some of the best people you knew. \u00a0</p><p>Maria had also brought her brother Sam. \u00a0With you, Steve, and his friend James \u201cno-one-calls-me-that-call-me-Bucky, \u201d the group was just big enough. \u00a0Dinner was relaxed, without much specific discussion of Steve and Bucky\u2019s work or long history, with minimal interference from you. \u00a0</p><p>Steve was really good at getting people to talk about themselves, and this group didn\u2019t need much encouragement to talk about their passions of working with students with special needs. \u00a0You had never met Sam before, but from the way he described his job as a school counselor, he clearly loved the work. \u00a0</p><p>The movie was a new twist on the buddy genre. \u00a0You laughed hysterically and fielded the silent buzz of text announcements from the Maria, Ally, and Jen throughout.</p><p><b>Maria: </b>Holy geez, HE is the \u201cnice neighbor\u201d you\u2019ve been talking about?<br></p><p><b>Ally:</b> Yeah, really Steph, the best description you could give was \u201cnice neighbor?\u201d</p><p><b>Jen: </b>How about \u201cadonis\u201d or \u201cthe most beautiful man you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d Those might have come close to describing him. \u00a0His friend is also smoking hot.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> HELL YEAH</p><p><b>Ally:</b> WOOOOOOO HOOOOOO</p><p><b>Steph:</b> STOP IT. \u00a02 of you are MARRIED WOMEN. \u00a0Yes, he\u2019s beautiful, but he\u2019s also really nice. \u00a0I knew you\u2019d all pester mercilessly if I went into detail, so I just glossed over it.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> So spill. \u00a0What\u2019s going on with you two? \u00a0Is this a thing?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Absolutely not. \u00a0I am totally aware of his physique (DONT YOU DARE GIVE ME SHIT ABOUT THT WORDING), but I am also totally aware that he has never given any inclination that he\u2019s interested in being anything more than friends, and I am REALLY fine with that.</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Can we PLEASE talk about this ltr? I want to watch the movie and all this texting is embarrassing.</p><p><b>Ally:</b> No, I don\u2019t think it is.</p><p><b>Jen: </b>I second Ally</p><p><b>Maria:</b> \u00a0Fine, we\u2019ll talk later. \u00a0So, what do you guys think of my brother? \u00a0Cute, huh?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> \u00a0I\u2019m turning off my phone. \u00a0You guys are hopeless. \u00a0I love you all to death, but you\u2019re hopeless.</p><p>The night ended with a cab for your friends and Sam, an unofficial agreement to get together again, and an extremely self-aware walk home with you between two huge, hulking men. \u00a0Bucky was quiet, but smiling, and you and Steve were going back and forth about the movie.<br></p><p>\u201cThere is no way that that car would have flipped like that in real life. \u00a0No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, ok, and what percentage of movie patrons would have the first-hand experience to know and refute that special effect? I liked it, it was nice to just laugh and give your brain a rest.</p><p>You were too tired for a night cap, so you wished them both a good night, shaking Bucky\u2019s hand, and giving Steve a peck on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt was really fun tonight. \u00a0Thank you both for coming - you definitely made it better. \u00a0Hope to see you soon Bucky and see you tomorrow Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to wake you up again? I\u2019d be happy to.\u201d You both laughed as you saw the confused smirk on Bucky\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. \u00a0I don\u2019t think our friendship could survive another morning like today. \u00a0I don\u2019t need another opportunity to look like a complete ass, but thanks for the offer.\u201d</p><p>As you closed the door, Steve and Bucky looked at each other. \u00a0As they went inside, Bucky finally had reason to speak.</p><p>\u201cI know that look, punk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and what look is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, jerk. \u00a0We are friends, nothing more. \u00a0She\u2019s a really great person - smart and funny, and her kids are just the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you don\u2019t like her, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if I do or don\u2019t, she has never given me any signs that she was interested that way. \u00a0We live next door to each other, I don\u2019t want to try something and have it be awkward after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever took you for a coward, punk.\u201d</p><h2><b><a href=\"http://stevieang.tumblr.com/post/176270859745/you-cant-hurry-love-chapter-430\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a></b></h2></p>",

Captain America as your next door neighbor came with some perks. You always felt safe in your apartment building, but now, you seemed to have a feeling of calm. \u00a0Something about being able to take down an alien invasion made cat burglars seem less scary. \u00a0Steve was an exceptionally generous neighbor, and it would have been very easy to take advantage of his kindness. \u00a0He regularly volunteered to walk with you and your girls after dark, pick up things like coffee and bagels while he was out, and keep an eye on you now and then during your early-morning walks (from afar, obviously, since your walking speed and his running speed were far from compatible.) \u00a0\u00a0Both of you tried to respectfully observe the friend/neighbor-of-the-opposite-sex boundary. \u00a0He always asked if he was \u201cnosing around\u201d too much, you always checked in when you or the girls had knocked a few too many times on his door. \u00a0It felt like a friendly and equitable give-and-take, except when it came to school fundraisers.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Steve had a big heart and a wicked sweet tooth, and every single teenage occupant and visitor to your apartment took full advantage of it. \u00a0After hitting him up for the third week in a row for yet another fundraiser, you suggested to your older daughter that maybe there was something nice you could do for Mr. Rogers in return, as a way of thanking him for his constant support. \u00a0She took the suggestion to heart and volunteered to water his plants when he was away.</p><p>\u201cMom, I asked Mr. Rogers if he needed someone to water his plants while he was away. \u00a0I noticed his always look droopy and sad. \u00a0He said wasn\u2019t sure because he wanted you to tell him if it was ok before he said yes. \u00a0So? Yes?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>You knocked on his door rather than text him - it was just faster - as he said, his texting was slow \u00a0due to his \u201cbig thumbs.\u201d \u00a0He smiled when he answered, with his ear to his phone. \u00a0</p><p>You mouthed, \u201cSORRY, LATER\u201d and turned around. \u00a0He grabbed your forearm, shook his head, and said, \u201cone minute,\u201d while raising his eyebrows and sweeping his arm towards his apartment, wordlessly asking you to come in. \u00a0As you sat at his kitchen table, he wrapped up his phone call.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Steve, didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. \u00a0What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie told me she volunteered to water your plants when you were away after she extorted you to buy more candy from her. \u00a0I think she felt a bit sheepish asking you again, but I believe the offer was sincere - she described your plants as \u201cdroopy and sad.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head and started to chuckle. \u00a0\u201cThat bad, huh? She\u2019s such a sweetheart. \u00a0That would be fine, but I told her you had to approve before I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine with me, as long as you\u2019re ok with us having a key to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my own little background check, and all signs point to a completely trustworthy family. \u00a0I\u2019ll drop the key by tonight, show her all the plants, and find some way to tell you when I leave, so she\u2019ll know when to come around. \u00a0Sound ok?\u201d</p><p>He had accepted your offer of joining you for dinner, so you were expecting the knock at the door. \u00a0Lizzie and Gabbi raced each other to the door and threw it open, shouting \u201cMr. Rogers!\u201d in unison and smiling ear-to-ear. \u00a0Gabbi pulled him by the hand to the table and pulled out the chair that was slowly becoming his. \u00a0He put a small bouquet of flowers on the table and sat down with a smile. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks for having me, ladies. \u00a0I don\u2019t cook that much for myself.\u201d \u00a0The girls started talking at the same time, both offering some version of how he was welcome any time. </p><p>Steve looked to you, and you nodded, \u201cOf course, anytime.\u201d</p><p>The talk at dinner centered around the plant watering process, and the responsibility that came with having a key to another person\u2019s home. \u00a0As the heavy, you of course had to lay down the rules about how this was going to work. \u00a0Both girls listened soberly and agreed to the few conditions, including never using the key without an adult knowing. \u00a0It made you proud to see them so sincere about something as simple as watering a neighbor\u2019s plants. \u00a0</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t keep the small smile off his face as he watched your little family figure out how they could help him, and, as Gabbi offered, \u201cany pets you might want to get,\u201d a suggestion which her older sister heartily endorsed. \u00a0You did not attempt to hide your less-than-thrilled reaction.</p><p>After dinner and cleanup was done, the girls were practically bouncing off the walls as they got their suitcases and stuff ready for their nights at their Dad\u2019s. \u00a0Not only were they staying three nights, they were going to see \u201cWicked\u201d on Broadway - a gift from their Dad and his girlfriend for both their birthdays. \u00a0You sent them on their way with hugs, kisses, and requests to send you pictures. \u00a0When you got back upstairs, Steve\u2019s apartment door was open and he yelled from inside.</p><p>\u201cHey, want a drink or some dessert? \u00a0Least I could do after that delicious dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am the queen of delicious spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0It\u2019s on my business card.\u201d You always made yourself smile. </p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d love something. \u00a0Want me to come here or you coming to me?\u201d</p><p>It may have sounded suggestive, but it wasn\u2019t meant that way. \u00a0You were always aware of Steve - his identities, his blue-green eyes, and that megawatt smile that could melt tungsten - you were a heterosexual woman, after all - but you didn\u2019t want to risk this friendship or look like an idiot by testing the romantic waters. \u00a0</p><p>Steve wasn\u2019t interested in you that way anyway, never having given you the slightest indication of wanting anything more than a platonic friendship. \u00a0You could only imagine that his ideal girl would look like a 1940\u2019s pinup or a sleek and lethal weapon, not a generously-sized woman of substance with lumps, bumps, and plenty of hips and ass to grab onto. \u00a0You were truly happy with yourself, but realistic about who might find that same happiness with you. </p><p>Dessert can just be dessert.</p><p>The evening ended perfectly. \u00a0Coffee with Bailey\u2019s, delicious dessert from the corner bakery, \u00a0and talking about anything and everything. \u00a0His work, your work, your love of World War II history and his first-hand experience with it. \u00a0After gently shaking you awake after falling asleep on his couch, you sleepily asked if he\u2019d like to join you and some friends from work for a night out tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just grabbing a quick bite then I think a movie. \u00a0Want to come? It\u2019s gotten really good reviews - looks funny. \u00a0There\u2019ll only be a few of us, and they are probably as clueless about your day job as I was. \u00a0If they\u2019re not, they are very discreet.\u201d</p><p>As he showed you to the door, three steps away, \u201cSounds great, thanks. \u00a0If nothing comes up for work, I\u2019ll be there. \u2018Night Stephanie\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, I have a favor to ask. \u00a0I know myself. \u00a0There is no way I am going to want to get up and \u00a0walk tomorrow, and of course you\u2019ll be running, because you would even if you\u2019d just been discharged from the hospital. \u00a0Would you mind knocking on my door before you leave? \u00a0That way, I\u2019ll have to get out of bed and that\u2019s the biggest hurdle. I\u2019d really appreciate it, even though you\u2019ll see me looking like a zombie.\u201d \u00a0He agreed and you soon were asleep.</p><p>Your alarm going off was not sufficient to get you out of bed, as you suspected. \u00a0Though you were a light sleeper, it appeared that the late night, along with the Bailey\u2019s, helped you also sleep through Steve\u2019s knocks. \u00a0When you heard your phone ring, you pried your eyes open and answered, \u201cHey lady, I\u2019ve been knocking for 5 minutes. \u00a0You alive in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Steve, in fact I am not. \u00a0Thanks so much for doing exactly what I asked you to. \u00a0I really appreciate it. \u00a0Enjoy your run.\u201d</p><p>All you heard was laughing as he started to bang on the door again AND press the doorbell. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop until you answer the door.\u201d </p><p>Why, oh why, did you ask the most diligent and responsible man on Earth to get you up? (Because you knew he would.). \u00a0</p><p>After throwing your phone into the pillow, you jumped out of bed, made sure your pajamas covered what needed covering, and put a headband on before throwing the door open with what must have been a sinister look. \u00a0</p><p>He was smiling ear-to-ear, looking generally mischievous and laughing, which only got louder when he saw your face. \u00a0You forgot that he dealt with real sinister all the time. \u00a0He could handle your version.</p><p>\u201cWell, you did what I asked with fidelity. \u00a0LOUDLY, but as I asked. \u00a0Thanks Steve, enjoy your run. \u00a0I\u2019m sorry I made you have a late start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m waiting for you to come with me.\u201d The look on your face was intended to scare him away. \u00a0Nope. \u00a0He was loving this torture. \u00a0You closed the door in his face as you went to get dressed, and heard him roar with laughter. \u00a0Finally, a real smile *may* have crossed your face. \u00a0</p><p>When you opened the door, ready to go, he acted as nothing had happened. \u00a0That you hadn\u2019t just been a complete pain in the ass baby and gotten mad at him for something YOU asked HIM to do. \u00a0To HELP YOU. \u00a0You weren\u2019t ready to give him the satisfaction of winning (immature, much?) so you didn\u2019t look at him, put in your earbuds and blasted your music. \u00a0</p><p>He did not stop smiling. \u00a0When you got outside, you went your own separate ways. \u00a0When you finished the 5K loop, you felt great, of course. \u00a0You also felt stupid, of course. \u00a0As you walked to get some coffee, you saw him sitting on the bench in front of the cafe, smiling with that shit-eating grin of his. \u00a0You had to laugh. \u00a0Hard.</p><p>Better get the apology over with. \u00a0\u201cSorry. \u00a0I acted like a jerk. \u00a0You did what I asked you to do and, no surprise, I hated it. \u00a0Thanks for sticking with me and getting me outside. \u00a0I appreciate it. \u00a0Can I buy you a coffee to apologize and say thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne coffee for both apologizing and thanking? \u00a0That doesn\u2019t seem quite fair, but ok.\u201d \u00a0You were getting used to the smart-ass version of his smile. You were grateful that you didn\u2019t have to belabor the point. \u00a0</p><p>Sometimes a guy friend is exactly what an over-talker and thinker like you needs. \u00a0You got your coffee, walked back in companionable silence, and went your separate ways, with promises to text about the movie/dinner thing that night.</p><p>\u201cWhen and where are we meeting tonight? What should I wear? Can I bring someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201c6:30, in front of your door, and whatever you would usually wear to the movies, and of course! See you then.\u201d</p><p>You had been colleagues and then friends with Maria, Ally, and Jen for over 10 years. \u00a0You loved them. \u00a0They had your back professionally and personally, and they were some of the best people you knew. \u00a0</p><p>Maria had also brought her brother Sam. \u00a0With you, Steve, and his friend James \u201cno-one-calls-me-that-call-me-Bucky, \u201d the group was just big enough. \u00a0Dinner was relaxed, without much specific discussion of Steve and Bucky\u2019s work or long history, with minimal interference from you. \u00a0</p><p>Steve was really good at getting people to talk about themselves, and this group didn\u2019t need much encouragement to talk about their passions of working with students with special needs. \u00a0You had never met Sam before, but from the way he described his job as a school counselor, he clearly loved the work. \u00a0</p><p>The movie was a new twist on the buddy genre. \u00a0You laughed hysterically and fielded the silent buzz of text announcements from the Maria, Ally, and Jen throughout.</p><p><b>Maria: </b>Holy geez, HE is the \u201cnice neighbor\u201d you\u2019ve been talking about?<br></p><p><b>Ally:</b> Yeah, really Steph, the best description you could give was \u201cnice neighbor?\u201d</p><p><b>Jen: </b>How about \u201cadonis\u201d or \u201cthe most beautiful man you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d Those might have come close to describing him. \u00a0His friend is also smoking hot.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> HELL YEAH</p><p><b>Ally:</b> WOOOOOOO HOOOOOO</p><p><b>Steph:</b> STOP IT. \u00a02 of you are MARRIED WOMEN. \u00a0Yes, he\u2019s beautiful, but he\u2019s also really nice. \u00a0I knew you\u2019d all pester mercilessly if I went into detail, so I just glossed over it.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> So spill. \u00a0What\u2019s going on with you two? \u00a0Is this a thing?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Absolutely not. \u00a0I am totally aware of his physique (DONT YOU DARE GIVE ME SHIT ABOUT THT WORDING), but I am also totally aware that he has never given any inclination that he\u2019s interested in being anything more than friends, and I am REALLY fine with that.</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Can we PLEASE talk about this ltr? I want to watch the movie and all this texting is embarrassing.</p><p><b>Ally:</b> No, I don\u2019t think it is.</p><p><b>Jen: </b>I second Ally</p><p><b>Maria:</b> \u00a0Fine, we\u2019ll talk later. \u00a0So, what do you guys think of my brother? \u00a0Cute, huh?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> \u00a0I\u2019m turning off my phone. \u00a0You guys are hopeless. \u00a0I love you all to death, but you\u2019re hopeless.</p><p>The night ended with a cab for your friends and Sam, an unofficial agreement to get together again, and an extremely self-aware walk home with you between two huge, hulking men. \u00a0Bucky was quiet, but smiling, and you and Steve were going back and forth about the movie.<br></p><p>\u201cThere is no way that that car would have flipped like that in real life. \u00a0No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, ok, and what percentage of movie patrons would have the first-hand experience to know and refute that special effect? I liked it, it was nice to just laugh and give your brain a rest.</p><p>You were too tired for a night cap, so you wished them both a good night, shaking Bucky\u2019s hand, and giving Steve a peck on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt was really fun tonight. \u00a0Thank you both for coming - you definitely made it better. \u00a0Hope to see you soon Bucky and see you tomorrow Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to wake you up again? I\u2019d be happy to.\u201d You both laughed as you saw the confused smirk on Bucky\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. \u00a0I don\u2019t think our friendship could survive another morning like today. \u00a0I don\u2019t need another opportunity to look like a complete ass, but thanks for the offer.\u201d</p><p>As you closed the door, Steve and Bucky looked at each other. \u00a0As they went inside, Bucky finally had reason to speak.</p><p>\u201cI know that look, punk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and what look is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, jerk. \u00a0We are friends, nothing more. \u00a0She\u2019s a really great person - smart and funny, and her kids are just the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you don\u2019t like her, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if I do or don\u2019t, she has never given me any signs that she was interested that way. \u00a0We live next door to each other, I don\u2019t want to try something and have it be awkward after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever took you for a coward, punk.\u201d</p><h2><b><a href=\"http://stevieang.tumblr.com/post/176270859745/you-cant-hurry-love-chapter-430\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a></b></h2></p>",

You always felt safe in your apartment building, but now, you seemed to have a feeling of calm. &nbsp;Something about being able to take down an alien invasion made cat burglars seem less scary. &nbsp;Steve was an exceptionally generous neighbor, and it would have been very easy to take advantage of his kindness. &nbsp;He regularly volunteered to walk with you and your girls after dark, pick up things like coffee and bagels while he was out, and keep an eye on you now and then during your early-morning walks (from afar, obviously, since your walking speed and his running speed were far from compatible.) &nbsp;&nbsp;Both of you tried to respectfully observe the friend/neighbor-of-the-opposite-sex boundary. &nbsp;He always asked if he was &ldquo;nosing around&rdquo; too much, you always checked in when you or the girls had knocked a few too many times on his door. &nbsp;It felt like a friendly and equitable give-and-take, except when it came to school fundraisers.</p><p>Steve had a big heart and a wicked sweet tooth, and every single teenage occupant and visitor to your apartment took full advantage of it. &nbsp;After hitting him up for the third week in a row for yet another fundraiser, you suggested to your older daughter that maybe there was something nice you could do for Mr. Rogers in return, as a way of thanking him for his constant support. &nbsp;She took the suggestion to heart and volunteered to water his plants when he was away.</p><p>&ldquo;Mom, I asked Mr. Rogers if he needed someone to water his plants while he was away. &nbsp;I noticed his always look droopy and sad. &nbsp;He said wasn&rsquo;t sure because he wanted you to tell him if it was ok before he said yes. &nbsp;So? Yes?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>You knocked on his door rather than text him - it was just faster - as he said, his texting was slow &nbsp;due to his &ldquo;big thumbs.&rdquo; &nbsp;He smiled when he answered, with his ear to his phone. &nbsp;</p><p>You mouthed, &ldquo;SORRY, LATER&rdquo; and turned around. &nbsp;He grabbed your forearm, shook his head, and said, &ldquo;one minute,&rdquo; while raising his eyebrows and sweeping his arm towards his apartment, wordlessly asking you to come in. &nbsp;As you sat at his kitchen table, he wrapped up his phone call.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Steve, didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lizzie told me she volunteered to water your plants when you were away after she extorted you to buy more candy from her. &nbsp;I think she felt a bit sheepish asking you again, but I believe the offer was sincere - she described your plants as &ldquo;droopy and sad.&rdquo;</p><p>He dropped his head and started to chuckle. &nbsp;&ldquo;That bad, huh? She&rsquo;s such a sweetheart. &nbsp;That would be fine, but I told her you had to approve before I agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine with me, as long as you&rsquo;re ok with us having a key to your place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did my own little background check, and all signs point to a completely trustworthy family. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll drop the key by tonight, show her all the plants, and find some way to tell you when I leave, so she&rsquo;ll know when to come around. &nbsp;Sound ok?&rdquo;</p><p>He had accepted your offer of joining you for dinner, so you were expecting the knock at the door. &nbsp;Lizzie and Gabbi raced each other to the door and threw it open, shouting &ldquo;Mr. Rogers!&rdquo; in unison and smiling ear-to-ear. &nbsp;Gabbi pulled him by the hand to the table and pulled out the chair that was slowly becoming his. &nbsp;He put a small bouquet of flowers on the table and sat down with a smile. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for having me, ladies. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t cook that much for myself.&rdquo; &nbsp;The girls started talking at the same time, both offering some version of how he was welcome any time. </p><p>Steve looked to you, and you nodded, &ldquo;Of course, anytime.&rdquo;</p><p>The talk at dinner centered around the plant watering process, and the responsibility that came with having a key to another person&rsquo;s home. &nbsp;As the heavy, you of course had to lay down the rules about how this was going to work. &nbsp;Both girls listened soberly and agreed to the few conditions, including never using the key without an adult knowing. &nbsp;It made you proud to see them so sincere about something as simple as watering a neighbor&rsquo;s plants. &nbsp;</p><p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t keep the small smile off his face as he watched your little family figure out how they could help him, and, as Gabbi offered, &ldquo;any pets you might want to get,&rdquo; a suggestion which her older sister heartily endorsed. &nbsp;You did not attempt to hide your less-than-thrilled reaction.</p><p>After dinner and cleanup was done, the girls were practically bouncing off the walls as they got their suitcases and stuff ready for their nights at their Dad&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Not only were they staying three nights, they were going to see &ldquo;Wicked&rdquo; on Broadway - a gift from their Dad and his girlfriend for both their birthdays. &nbsp;You sent them on their way with hugs, kisses, and requests to send you pictures. &nbsp;When you got back upstairs, Steve&rsquo;s apartment door was open and he yelled from inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, want a drink or some dessert? &nbsp;Least I could do after that delicious dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am the queen of delicious spaghetti and meatballs. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s on my business card.&rdquo; You always made yourself smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;d love something. &nbsp;Want me to come here or you coming to me?&rdquo;</p><p>It may have sounded suggestive, but it wasn&rsquo;t meant that way. &nbsp;You were always aware of Steve - his identities, his blue-green eyes, and that megawatt smile that could melt tungsten - you were a heterosexual woman, after all - but you didn&rsquo;t want to risk this friendship or look like an idiot by testing the romantic waters. &nbsp;</p><p>Steve wasn&rsquo;t interested in you that way anyway, never having given you the slightest indication of wanting anything more than a platonic friendship. &nbsp;You could only imagine that his ideal girl would look like a 1940&rsquo;s pinup or a sleek and lethal weapon, not a generously-sized woman of substance with lumps, bumps, and plenty of hips and ass to grab onto. &nbsp;You were truly happy with yourself, but realistic about who might find that same happiness with you. </p><p>Dessert can just be dessert.</p><p>The evening ended perfectly. &nbsp;Coffee with Bailey&rsquo;s, delicious dessert from the corner bakery, &nbsp;and talking about anything and everything. &nbsp;His work, your work, your love of World War II history and his first-hand experience with it. &nbsp;After gently shaking you awake after falling asleep on his couch, you sleepily asked if he&rsquo;d like to join you and some friends from work for a night out tomorrow.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just grabbing a quick bite then I think a movie. &nbsp;Want to come? It&rsquo;s gotten really good reviews - looks funny. &nbsp;There&rsquo;ll only be a few of us, and they are probably as clueless about your day job as I was. &nbsp;If they&rsquo;re not, they are very discreet.&rdquo;</p><p>As he showed you to the door, three steps away, &ldquo;Sounds great, thanks. &nbsp;If nothing comes up for work, I&rsquo;ll be there. &lsquo;Night Stephanie&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I have a favor to ask. &nbsp;I know myself. &nbsp;There is no way I am going to want to get up and &nbsp;walk tomorrow, and of course you&rsquo;ll be running, because you would even if you&rsquo;d just been discharged from the hospital. &nbsp;Would you mind knocking on my door before you leave? &nbsp;That way, I&rsquo;ll have to get out of bed and that&rsquo;s the biggest hurdle. I&rsquo;d really appreciate it, even though you&rsquo;ll see me looking like a zombie.&rdquo; &nbsp;He agreed and you soon were asleep.</p><p>Your alarm going off was not sufficient to get you out of bed, as you suspected. &nbsp;Though you were a light sleeper, it appeared that the late night, along with the Bailey&rsquo;s, helped you also sleep through Steve&rsquo;s knocks. &nbsp;When you heard your phone ring, you pried your eyes open and answered, &ldquo;Hey lady, I&rsquo;ve been knocking for 5 minutes. &nbsp;You alive in there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No Steve, in fact I am not. &nbsp;Thanks so much for doing exactly what I asked you to. &nbsp;I really appreciate it. &nbsp;Enjoy your run.&rdquo;</p><p>All you heard was laughing as he started to bang on the door again AND press the doorbell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stop until you answer the door.&rdquo; </p><p>Why, oh why, did you ask the most diligent and responsible man on Earth to get you up? (Because you knew he would.). &nbsp;</p><p>After throwing your phone into the pillow, you jumped out of bed, made sure your pajamas covered what needed covering, and put a headband on before throwing the door open with what must have been a sinister look. &nbsp;</p><p>He was smiling ear-to-ear, looking generally mischievous and laughing, which only got louder when he saw your face. &nbsp;You forgot that he dealt with real sinister all the time. &nbsp;He could handle your version.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you did what I asked with fidelity. &nbsp;LOUDLY, but as I asked. &nbsp;Thanks Steve, enjoy your run. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry I made you have a late start.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m waiting for you to come with me.&rdquo; The look on your face was intended to scare him away. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;He was loving this torture. &nbsp;You closed the door in his face as you went to get dressed, and heard him roar with laughter. &nbsp;Finally, a real smile *may* have crossed your face. &nbsp;</p><p>When you opened the door, ready to go, he acted as nothing had happened. &nbsp;That you hadn&rsquo;t just been a complete pain in the ass baby and gotten mad at him for something YOU asked HIM to do. &nbsp;To HELP YOU. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t ready to give him the satisfaction of winning (immature, much?) so you didn&rsquo;t look at him, put in your earbuds and blasted your music. &nbsp;</p><p>He did not stop smiling. &nbsp;When you got outside, you went your own separate ways. &nbsp;When you finished the 5K loop, you felt great, of course. &nbsp;You also felt stupid, of course. &nbsp;As you walked to get some coffee, you saw him sitting on the bench in front of the cafe, smiling with that shit-eating grin of his. &nbsp;You had to laugh. &nbsp;Hard.</p><p>Better get the apology over with. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry. &nbsp;I acted like a jerk. &nbsp;You did what I asked you to do and, no surprise, I hated it. &nbsp;Thanks for sticking with me and getting me outside. &nbsp;I appreciate it. &nbsp;Can I buy you a coffee to apologize and say thank you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One coffee for both apologizing and thanking? &nbsp;That doesn&rsquo;t seem quite fair, but ok.&rdquo; &nbsp;You were getting used to the smart-ass version of his smile. You were grateful that you didn&rsquo;t have to belabor the point. &nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes a guy friend is exactly what an over-talker and thinker like you needs. &nbsp;You got your coffee, walked back in companionable silence, and went your separate ways, with promises to text about the movie/dinner thing that night.</p><p>&ldquo;When and where are we meeting tonight? What should I wear? Can I bring someone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;6:30, in front of your door, and whatever you would usually wear to the movies, and of course! See you then.&rdquo;</p><p>You had been colleagues and then friends with Maria, Ally, and Jen for over 10 years. &nbsp;You loved them. &nbsp;They had your back professionally and personally, and they were some of the best people you knew. &nbsp;</p><p>Maria had also brought her brother Sam. &nbsp;With you, Steve, and his friend James &ldquo;no-one-calls-me-that-call-me-Bucky, &rdquo; the group was just big enough. &nbsp;Dinner was relaxed, without much specific discussion of Steve and Bucky&rsquo;s work or long history, with minimal interference from you. &nbsp;</p><p>Steve was really good at getting people to talk about themselves, and this group didn&rsquo;t need much encouragement to talk about their passions of working with students with special needs. &nbsp;You had never met Sam before, but from the way he described his job as a school counselor, he clearly loved the work. &nbsp;</p><p>The movie was a new twist on the buddy genre. &nbsp;You laughed hysterically and fielded the silent buzz of text announcements from the Maria, Ally, and Jen throughout.</p><p><b>Maria: </b>Holy geez, HE is the &ldquo;nice neighbor&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve been talking about?<br /></p><p><b>Ally:</b> Yeah, really Steph, the best description you could give was &ldquo;nice neighbor?&rdquo;</p><p><b>Jen: </b>How about &ldquo;adonis&rdquo; or &ldquo;the most beautiful man you&rsquo;ve ever seen?&rdquo; Those might have come close to describing him. &nbsp;His friend is also smoking hot.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> HELL YEAH</p><p><b>Ally:</b> WOOOOOOO HOOOOOO</p><p><b>Steph:</b> STOP IT. &nbsp;2 of you are MARRIED WOMEN. &nbsp;Yes, he&rsquo;s beautiful, but he&rsquo;s also really nice. &nbsp;I knew you&rsquo;d all pester mercilessly if I went into detail, so I just glossed over it.</p><p><b>Maria:</b> So spill. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s going on with you two? &nbsp;Is this a thing?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Absolutely not. &nbsp;I am totally aware of his physique (DONT YOU DARE GIVE ME SHIT ABOUT THT WORDING), but I am also totally aware that he has never given any inclination that he&rsquo;s interested in being anything more than friends, and I am REALLY fine with that.</p><p><b>Steph:</b> Can we PLEASE talk about this ltr? I want to watch the movie and all this texting is embarrassing.</p><p><b>Ally:</b> No, I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p><p><b>Jen: </b>I second Ally</p><p><b>Maria:</b> &nbsp;Fine, we&rsquo;ll talk later. &nbsp;So, what do you guys think of my brother? &nbsp;Cute, huh?</p><p><b>Steph:</b> &nbsp;I&rsquo;m turning off my phone. &nbsp;You guys are hopeless. &nbsp;I love you all to death, but you&rsquo;re hopeless.</p><p>The night ended with a cab for your friends and Sam, an unofficial agreement to get together again, and an extremely self-aware walk home with you between two huge, hulking men. &nbsp;Bucky was quiet, but smiling, and you and Steve were going back and forth about the movie.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There is no way that that car would have flipped like that in real life. &nbsp;No way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, ok, and what percentage of movie patrons would have the first-hand experience to know and refute that special effect? I liked it, it was nice to just laugh and give your brain a rest.</p><p>You were too tired for a night cap, so you wished them both a good night, shaking Bucky&rsquo;s hand, and giving Steve a peck on the cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;It was really fun tonight. &nbsp;Thank you both for coming - you definitely made it better. &nbsp;Hope to see you soon Bucky and see you tomorrow Steve?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need me to wake you up again? I&rsquo;d be happy to.&rdquo; You both laughed as you saw the confused smirk on Bucky&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, no. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think our friendship could survive another morning like today. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t need another opportunity to look like a complete ass, but thanks for the offer.&rdquo;</p><p>As you closed the door, Steve and Bucky looked at each other. &nbsp;As they went inside, Bucky finally had reason to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that look, punk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and what look is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, jerk. &nbsp;We are friends, nothing more. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s a really great person - smart and funny, and her kids are just the best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good thing you don&rsquo;t like her, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter if I do or don&rsquo;t, she has never given me any signs that she was interested that way. &nbsp;We live next door to each other, I don&rsquo;t want to try something and have it be awkward after.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never took you for a coward, punk.&rdquo;</p><h2><b><a href=\"http://stevieang.tumblr.com/post/176270859745/you-cant-hurry-love-chapter-430\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a></b></h2></p>",

You always felt safe in your apartment building, but now, you seemed to have a feeling of calm. &nbsp;Something about being able to take down an alien invasion made cat burglars seem less scary. &nbsp;Steve was an exceptionally generous neighbor, and it would have been very easy to take advantage of his kindness. &nbsp;He regularly volunteered to walk with you and your girls after dark, pick up things like coffee and bagels while he was out, and keep an eye on you now and then during your early-morning walks (from afar, obviously, since your walking speed and his running speed were far from compatible.) &nbsp;&nbsp;Both of you tried to respectfully observe the friend/neighbor-of-the-opposite-sex boundary. &nbsp;He always asked if he was &ldquo;nosing around&rdquo; too much, you always checked in when you or the girls had knocked a few too many times on his door. &nbsp;It felt like a friendly and equitable give-and-take, except when it came to school fundraisers.</p>\n</p>",

Thanks for reading and let me know if you want to be tagged! </p><p><a href=\"https://sebtrashcan-stan.tumblr.com/post/176235110594/oww-masterlist\">OWW MASTERLIST</a> - <a href=\"https://sebtrashcan-stan.tumblr.com/post/174269328609/masterlist-slumber-parties-lab-incidents-peter\">MAIN MASTERLIST</a></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/f8a80dfd07f8a4bb06e4d215e8675c62/tumblr_pcdr6a6su31vv2qfg_raw.gif\">External image</div></figure><p>It had been a month since you had last gone out on an assignment which was why you were sitting in your office scrolling through your twitter replies to try and find the next celebrity for your One Week With series. O.W.W. was in some ways similar to the 73 Questions interviews that were also produced by Vogue, where audiences could get a closer look at the lives of their favorite celebrities. The difference was that instead of a seven to ten-minute video, either you or someone else on your team would live with a celebrity for one week and then write about your experience. </p><p>Lately, you had been getting a ton of requests to do Sebastian Stan. He had always been one of your favorite actors ever since you watched him on Gossip Girl so you were excited by the prospect of getting to work with him. With this in mind you sent an email to your boss Laura, telling her you&rsquo;d like to do the next segment on Sebastian, but also including other options in case he wasn&rsquo;t available. She would reach out to your options and within the next week you would find out where and with who you would be spending a week of your life with. </p><p>Sebastian and his manager, Emily, were having their monthly meeting where they would go over his plans for the month and put together a schedule with all of his events. Emily was going over some options for interviews and appearances he was offered when she brought up the request from Vogue for him to do one of their segments. </p><p>&ldquo;You have an email from the people over at Vogue; they&rsquo;re wondering if you&rsquo;d be interested in doing one of their One Week With interviews.&rdquo; </p><p>Sebastian looked up from the calendar he&rsquo;d been trying to memorize, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one where they send someone to follow you around and live in your house for a week right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty much, yes.&rdquo; Emily nodded. &ldquo;If you say yes then they&rsquo;ll send someone called Y/N Y/L/N to your apartment whenever you&rsquo;re available in the next month. You&rsquo;d also have to do a photo shoot to go with the article,&rdquo; she explained, reading from the email. </p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like fun, I have press week for the new movie next week so maybe she could come over the week after?</p><p>&ldquo;Okay so she&rsquo;ll be accompanying you to the photoshoot, the appearance you have to make at the opening of that new musical on broadway, and GMA. Does that work for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah that works out well, we&rsquo;ll be busy but not overwhelmed,&rdquo; answered Sebastian looking back down at his calendar and making a note that he would be accompanied during the mentioned events. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back to them now and let them know you&rsquo;re interested.&rdquo;</p><p>On Monday morning when you arrived at work there was an information packet titled Sebastian Stan sitting on your desk. </p><h2>Taglist (Open)</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSlBCwJOHAjsZSNZMkzoK2g\">@katherinemorgenstern93</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meNeSTQ_DXZRJuq-NZmubgw\">@peppermintvanillaa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1KlcUvHWjDNCXAqYZax2QQ\">@marbleowl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLcfxXn96isxRLu4hNsiDEA\">@wrthyofluv</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJiptRtVRxrlzA1ucmISLw\">@wantonmeep</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m77baAt7jXvnH_BWYKGIVow\">@soldierplum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKd6RGSKVDlHwD8d0I16apA\">@bucky-is-a-hero-fightme</a> </p></p>",
