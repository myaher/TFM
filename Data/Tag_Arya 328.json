Because I don&rsquo;t think that she is anything like that. Like let&rsquo;s take the above excerpt for an example. Here we see Arya observing the man who is going to be her  very first &ldquo;kill&rdquo; as a novice of the HoBaW. Now what I find interesting here is how she desperately tries to come up with a valid reason about why she should be killing off this man. She tries to tell herself that the man is well past fifty and has lived long enough. She even thinks about how her father never got to live that long. This seems to be a half hearted try from Arya to make the man&rsquo;s impending doom justifiable to herself.

Now please keep in mind that I am only saying this in reference to what happened the last time she was disguised as the Cat of the canals. At that time the Ibbenese whalers treated her almost the same way as this man and yet she did not think about them twice. Another thing that I want to point out is that after a few lines from this paragraph we see her call the man &lsquo;evil&rsquo; based on his appearance. This is a direct contradiction to her character. Because Arya has never been the one to judge a person based on his/her outward appearance. In fact she has always tried to look at what lies beyond the surface. So I feel like Arya is deliberately trying to make herself believe that the man is evil. And it must be so because she fears that she is assassinating an innocent person. ( We even see her asking the Kindly Man if the Gods have judged this man! )</p><p>The concept of death has always been  traumatising to Arya. In fact she has nightmares about killing the stable boy, Dareon and the Tickler. So it strikes me odd that she should claim that the man will thank her for a gift from the Many faced. I think that Arya is feeling guilty here and is therefore trying to tell herself that she is not doing anything wrong. It is only after she hears about how the man is cheating the widows and the children of the unfortunate seafarers out of their insurance money that she finally devises a plan to kill him. </p><p><i>Cat understood.

Now I am not trying to be that dick who tells people how they should or shouldn\u2019t potray a character in their own fanworks. But the thing is I personally don\u2019t agree with it. Because I don\u2019t think that she is anything like that. Like let\u2019s take the above excerpt for an example. Here we see Arya observing the man who is going to be her  very first \u201ckill\u201d as a novice of the HoBaW. Now what I find interesting here is how she desperately tries to come up with a valid reason about why she should be killing off this man. She tries to tell herself that the man is well past fifty and has lived long enough. She even thinks about how her father never got to live that long. This seems to be a half hearted try from Arya to make the man\u2019s impending doom justifiable to herself. She fails to do so of course and thus tries to chanel in her anger.</p><p>\u201c<i>She even smiled at him. Sometimes a smile was all you needed to make them stop and buy. The old man did not smile back. He scowled at her and went on past, sloshing through a puddle. The splash wet her feet. <b>He has no courtesy, she thought, watching him go. His face is hard and mean.\u201d</b></i></p><p>What I find peculiar here is how Arya takes an offence at this man\u2019s behaviour. Now please keep in mind that I am only saying this in reference to what happened the last time she was disguised as the Cat of the canals. At that time the Ibbenese whalers treated her almost the same way as this man and yet she did not think about them twice. Another thing that I want to point out is that after a few lines from this paragraph we see her call the man \u2018evil\u2019 based on his appearance. This is a direct contradiction to her character. Because Arya has never been the one to judge a person based on his/her outward appearance. In fact she has always tried to look at what lies beyond the surface. So I feel like Arya is deliberately trying to make herself believe that the man is evil. And it must be so because she fears that she is assassinating an innocent person. ( We even see her asking the Kindly Man if the Gods have judged this man! )</p><p>The concept of death has always been  traumatising to Arya. In fact she has nightmares about killing the stable boy, Dareon and the Tickler. So it strikes me odd that she should claim that the man will thank her for a gift from the Many faced. I think that Arya is feeling guilty here and is therefore trying to tell herself that she is not doing anything wrong. It is only after she hears about how the man is cheating the widows and the children of the unfortunate seafarers out of their insurance money that she finally devises a plan to kill him. </p><p><i>Cat understood. One of them must hate him. One of them came to the House of Black and White and prayed for the god to take him. <b>She wondered who it had been, but the kindly man would not tell her. \u201cIt is not for you to pry into such matters,\u201d he said. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo one.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo one asks no questions.\u201d</i></b><i> He took her hands. \u201cIf you cannot do this thing, you need only say so.

I will.\u201d</i></p><p>I like the implication of Arya trying to know about the person who has prayed for the gift. I also like how the Kindly Man says that the faceless men do not ask questions. But Arya is no faceless man and therefore she is always going to ask questions. She is not a heartless killer either. No matter how much some people claim her to be an \u201cempty husk of herself\u201d. The emotions that she goes through here is a proof of that.</p>",
