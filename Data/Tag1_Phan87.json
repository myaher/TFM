I am not in the camp of people who think Dan and Phil have gotten more open with their audience over time (I think the opposite actually), but Dan really put himself out there and shared something raw and personal in Daniel and Depression and it always makes me sad to see people use that against him, whether it be in ways like this or the opposite, when people feel the need to inject mental health struggles into every aspect of his life and treat him like he is exceedingly fragile because of it. It\u2019s all really below the belt as far as I\u2019m concerned. There seems to be a big lack of self-awareness in the phandom (not just talking about IDB here) where people don\u2019t seem to realize that every time they use personal information that Dan has shared against him, they are consistently reinforcing to him that he can\u2019t trust us enough to share things with us, which is what most of the phandom wants him to do. I just really dislike how much people exploit Dan\u2019s admission that he struggles with depression, especially since he was very clear that he didn\u2019t want it to be used to define him. It\u2019s dirty and only serves to stigmatize mental health further. </p>",
