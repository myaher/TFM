I\u2019ve seen a lot of people claim that the sisters hated each other and made each other miserable but I just don\u2019t see that in the books.</p><p>TLDR: Sometimes a sibling rivalry is just a sibling rivalry.</p><!-- more --><p>My brother and I were close in age and bickered and fought constantly as kids. We\u2019d get all worked up and say mean things or \u201ctattle\u201d or shove each other and it would be a whole thing.\u00a0My brother and I weren\u2019t pitted against each other by our family, friends, or teachers. But we still argued regularly. We still developed a competitive relationship that lasted throughout our childhoods.\u00a0</p><p>But we grew out of it. Around the time I was 16 my brother quite suddenly became my friend, ally, and confidant. We had developed the maturity needed to use our words and take a minute to consider that the other might not be trying to upset us, or to just walk away sometimes. We also began to understand that\u00a0 the nasty things we said and did to each other did matter. It wasn\u2019t until I was 17 that I realized that what I\u2019d thought was joke teasing had actually hurt him. I didn\u2019t even think I had the ability to hurt his feelings. And he had the same realization about me.\u00a0Regardless of our petty fights we never hated each other. In fact when we weren\u2019t squabbling together we were playing together.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0I\u2019ve never had a sister and I don\u2019t live in the asoiaf misogynistic society that so openly and structurally calculates ones worth on gender based accomplishments so it\u2019s not quite the same situation. But I do see a lot of my own sibling relationship in Arya and Sansa.

Most people are assuming that he does this because she kidnaps Sansa and he\u2019s forced to travel south and bend the knee to make sure that Sansa is safe.</p><p>However, this assumption throws up some questions, for instance, how did Cersei manage to kidnap Sansa from Winterfell? Sansa is the Lady of Winterfell and currently Queen in the North and furthermore, her people respect and admire her. Add to that, Arya is back at Winterfell, before long Brienne will reach her as well. And even though Jon is travelling with Dany, we know just how much he prizes Sansa\u2019s safety. So when she\u2019s surrounded by so many people who are more than capable of keeping her safe, how will Cersei manage to kidnap her?</p><p>I think this is where Tyrion will come into play. We\u2019ve seen him get pushed to the sidelines by Dany now that she\u2019s agreed to help Jon and his cause. We\u2019ve also seen him look less-than-pleased by the turn of events (boatbang) Holding the camera on his expression was a deliberate choice and it lasts too long to not have some significance. Once their convoy reaches Winterfell, we will see Tyrion\u2019s dissatisfaction grow even more. Most GA like Tyrion and ShowTyrion is way more likeable than BookTyrion (for the sake of clarity I will be only be talking about ShowTyrion in this post) Prior to joining Dany, Tyrion had hit rock bottom, he had just killed his father and Shae and was a fugitive on the run.</p><p>Tyrion also has a few very key weak spots. One is that he\u2019s scared of being expendable and not being of any consequence, and he likes having power. Now, he\u2019s not power-mad like Cersei and a certain other queen who loves titles, but he does have a taste for it. And despite being unwanted by his father, he\u2019s grown up with power at his disposal. He won\u2019t like that he\u2019s been set aside in favour of someone else, someone he never imagined would come to have so much influence over Dany. And he resents that loss of power.</p><p>Tyrion also has a soft-spot for his family and unlike Cersei, he gets blind-sided by it. Cersei hates Tyrion and she embraces it, she makes no bones about it. But it\u2019s not so clear cut for Tyrion. He may have hated Joffrey but he felt genuine affection for Tommen and Myrcella. And now that Cersei is pregnant again, she plays into his weak-spot. We don\u2019t see how their conversation concludes and it was too important to have been just cut-off like that. If we didn\u2019t see it conclude then we can safely assume that it will have some influence on future events.</p><p>So, resenting his loss of station and whatever it is that he and Cersei decided will lead him to kidnap Sansa. Also keep in mind, Sansa trusts him, she thinks that he won\u2019t hurt her. But like her, he too has changed and is no longer as noble as he\u2019d like to think. He is the only person I think who could kidnap Sansa and get her out of Winterfell.</p><p>Now, onto Jon bending the knee to Cersei in King\u2019s Landing. That too looks like a misdirect. Sansa tells Jon time and again that Jon must make smarter choices. Their father\u2019s honour will not help them in the wars to come and I think we can safely assume that Jon is following that advice (Political!Jon) The other thing she tries to stress is just how dangerous Cersei is and that they can\u2019t afford to underestimate her. I think Jon believes her. When he realises that Sansa has been taken, his first impulse will be to ride south. But that\u2019s precisely what he did when he saw Rickon on the battlefield (Battle of the Bastards) and almost died and lost his entire army. Sansa had told him then as well that they won\u2019t get Rickon back, he ignored her and nearly died. He won\u2019t make that same mistake again.</p><p>This is where Brienne and Jaime come in. Jaime has been trying to live a more honourable existence and season 7 finally saw breaking away from the toxic relationship he shares with Cersei. Brienne is sworn to protect Sansa and Jamie will not let her go into King\u2019s Landing alone, considering that he knows that place far better than she does. I think the Hound will play some part in this as well, and this is how he will finally face his brother and kill him once and for all. I have a feeling that Arya will have to stay at Winterfell, they can\u2019t have almost all the Starks so deep in enemy territory.</p><p>So while, Jon makes sure that all of Cersei\u2019s attention is focused on him, Jaime, Brienne and the Hound will infiltrate King\u2019s Landing and rescue Sansa.</p><p>Realising that Sansa has been taken could also be how Jon finally faces his feelings for her, accepts them for what they are and will act on them when he gets her back.</p><p>Tagging <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4x_X-QI6QesMTOLt6pcCug\">@jonsa101</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> for their inputs.<br/></p><p><b>Update: </b>This is a speculation post, naturally there will be people who will disagree and that\u2019s fine.

        "answer": "<p>This argument would have merit if Sansa wasn\u2019t willing to do it herself. Sansa told Jon that Ramsay had Rickon <i>and</i> that they\u2019ll never be safe as long as Ramsay lived. The closer they got to the battle, the more obvious the military disadvantage became to Sansa so she warned Jon not to fall for Ramsay\u2019s mind games which would certainly involve Rickon\n\n as only a good strategy could save them from a crushing defeat. Now the show\u2019s writing is awful so you have to mentally connect dots but it\u2019s very clear how Sansa goes from wanting to rescue Rickon to accepting his death. Also Sansa\u2019s reaction to Rickon had little to do with Jon and everything to do with the writers transforming her into their idea of badass.</p>",
