        "body": "<p>Tony kept his three favorite photographs hidden within his office desk, tucked away in a thumbprint-locked compartment that only he had access to. He didn\u2019t examine them often, but it was during occasions like these, when Loki was off in some far-off realm gathering materials for his studies and the ache in Tony\u2019s chest was too much to bear, that he pulled them out. He leaned back in his chair and held one up, a selfie \u2013 or, more specifically, Loki\u2019s first attempt at a selfie on the phone Tony gifted him during the initial weeks of their relationship. It was a blurry shot of Loki\u2019s face. Only half of it, caught in the motion of a quick head turn. The effect was an almost watercolor-like blurring of his features, softening them. Tony could barely make out the green of Loki\u2019s eyes. The only thing that was in relative focus was the one perfect curl that framed Loki\u2019s face, the one Tony loved to tug before Loki could bat his hand away, laughing as it sprung back into shape. Grinning, he set the photo aside.</p><p>The second was one he took of Loki. And how could he not? The jerk looked so devilishly handsome sitting in the little reading nook he had carved out for himself when he moved into the tower. Loki\u2019s legs were pulled up close to his body and a light knit blanket draped over his thighs. Sunlight streamed in through the windows and caught green and purple and blue in Loki\u2019s hair, shades Tony had never seen before but ones that the camera picked up marvelously. There was a thick tome levitating in front of Loki\u2019s view, written in a language Tony didn\u2019t recognize as one from Earth, and clasped in his grasp was a large mug \u2013 tea, if Tony remembered correctly, and a gross one, too. Loki had convinced him to try it, promised it was mellow, then laughed as the overbearing sweetness practically gave him an immediate cavity. Loki even had a subtle smirk on his face in the photo, as if he could hear Tony\u2019s current thoughts. Smug bastard. He flipped to the next photo, eager to rid the taste from his mouth.</p><p>The last photo, his favorite of the three, was one JARVIS captured while he and Loki were unaware. They were gathered in an exhausted heap on the rug in front of the fireplace, wings and tails twined around each other in an intimate draconian embrace. They had been chasing each other around his penthouse. He grinned, thinking of the scene they must have made. Tiny dragons, one red, one oily black, bounding and tumbling over couches and chairs and tables, nipping at tails and pinning each other to the ground and rolling around in play. He wondered if JARVIS recorded any of it.</p><p>Looking back at the photo, Tony took in Loki\u2019s dragon form. The transformation was a recent development, though one that didn\u2019t require too much prompting from Tony. A good dose of dragon eyes and a pleading head tilt was all it took for Tony to convince Loki to shift for him. And he was \u2013 is \u2013 stunning. He was more serpent-like in appearance compared to Tony. Where Tony was square and angular, Loki was sleek and elegant. His scales, a reflective black, shifting with those same shades found in his sunlit hair, even caught some of the red from Tony\u2019s scales. His tail, like his body, was long and slender, lacking spines. Similarly, forked onyx horns laid back against his head and two black tendrils extended from his snout, sleepily curling in the air. Tony traced his nail over the green edge of Loki\u2019s wing as it draped over his back. Tony had smiled then and he smiled now as he recounted the possessive gesture, one he wondered if Loki knew the true meaning of. Even if he didn\u2019t, warmth bloomed in Tony\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d JARVIS said, and Tony looked up, a soft smile on his face. \u201cLoki has returned.\u201d</p><p>With a final stroke over Loki\u2019s tiny cheek, Tony replaced the photographs and locked them away before he shot up, smile broadening on his face, as he went out to welcome him home.</p><hr><p>For more dragon times, follow:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17533676/chapters/41312006\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17533676/chapters/41312006</a></p>",

He flipped to the next photo, eager to rid the taste from his mouth.</p><p>The last photo, his favorite of the three, was one JARVIS captured while he and Loki were unaware. They were gathered in an exhausted heap on the rug in front of the fireplace, wings and tails twined around each other in an intimate draconian embrace. They had been chasing each other around his penthouse. He grinned, thinking of the scene they must have made. Tiny dragons, one red, one oily black, bounding and tumbling over couches and chairs and tables, nipping at tails and pinning each other to the ground and rolling around in play. He wondered if JARVIS recorded any of it.</p><p>Looking back at the photo, Tony took in Loki&rsquo;s dragon form. The transformation was a recent development, though one that didn&rsquo;t require too much prompting from Tony. A good dose of dragon eyes and a pleading head tilt was all it took for Tony to convince Loki to shift for him. And he was &ndash; is &ndash; stunning. He was more serpent-like in appearance compared to Tony. Where Tony was square and angular, Loki was sleek and elegant. His scales, a reflective black, shifting with those same shades found in his sunlit hair, even caught some of the red from Tony&rsquo;s scales. His tail, like his body, was long and slender, lacking spines. Similarly, forked onyx horns laid back against his head and two black tendrils extended from his snout, sleepily curling in the air. Tony traced his nail over the green edge of Loki&rsquo;s wing as it draped over his back. Tony had smiled then and he smiled now as he recounted the possessive gesture, one he wondered if Loki knew the true meaning of. Even if he didn&rsquo;t, warmth bloomed in Tony&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; JARVIS said, and Tony looked up, a soft smile on his face. &ldquo;Loki has returned.&rdquo;</p><p>With a final stroke over Loki&rsquo;s tiny cheek, Tony replaced the photographs and locked them away before he shot up, smile broadening on his face, as he went out to welcome him home.</p><hr /><p>For more dragon times, follow:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17533676/chapters/41312006\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17533676/chapters/41312006</a></p>",

So he\u2019ll usually get started on Steve\u2019s breakfast, which is basically cooking for two. Four slices of toast, four eggs, two strips of bacon, (he\u2019s not making more, Steve doesn\u2019t need that much) and a bowl of fruit. He also makes coffee, which is more for him.\u00a0</p><p>At around six forty, Steve will come back, shower, and drop a kiss on Tony\u2019s temple.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRun was good. I got to pet three dogs.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMore than yesterday, babe, good for you.\u201d Steve grins, nabbing his plate.\u00a0\u201cNo more bacon?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo more bacon,\u201d Tony says.\u00a0\u201cIf I have to watch what I\u2019m eating, so do you.

Time differences, babe.\u201d Tony likes the pet names. Steve lives for them. He uses the usual ones\u2013honey, babe, sweetheart, darling, love, all of that. Tony loves it. It means more to him than he knows, perhaps because Steve doesn\u2019t say things unless he <i>really </i>means them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Lunch passes quickly, with Steve being late and the suit ruffled a little bit always. Natasha says she and Maria always make fun of him.\u00a0</p><p>Next kiss is usually a text from either of them. Both love their work, and so Steve may be staying thirty minutes later or Tony will. (They set a limit, obviously. Whether or not it\u2019s actually followed is usually up to the urgency.) Steve or Tony will text that they\u2019re late, a kiss at the end. Still nice, if a bit artificial.\u00a0</p><p>Dinnertime is Steve\u2019s time to cook. He loves doing it. He usually sets Dean Martin\u2019s music up, singing alone to the music as Tony teases him over the pronunciation of some of the Italian.

Just because she likes to act like she knows all doesn\u2019t mean she does.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe knows about the incident of us and office room J.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve laughs, shaking out some more seasoning for the meat. He hums along to some Sinatra as he drops the broccoli onto the cutting board.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, honey?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Steve says.\u00a0\u201cNothing except give me a kiss. You got breakfast. I got dinner.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd you get me lunch. You technically get <i>two </i>meals, which means I have to make it up somehow.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLove doesn\u2019t get made up, it just exists,\u201d Steve reminds him, dropping another kiss on him.\u00a0\u201cAnd you are by far the best existence to me.\u201d Tony snorts, rolling his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou geek, quit being so sappy. People might think we\u2019re in love or something.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh we\u2019ve had no idea!\u201d Bruce calls from the hallway.\u00a0\u201cNo idea that you two are the grossest married couple in existence!\u201d Steve lets out a bellowing laugh, head thrown back.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks Bruce!\u201d he yells back.\u00a0<br/></p><p>They eat dinner together, talking about the rest of their day. Tony had a couple of international meetings which went well. Tony\u2019s working on renewable energy for other countries, running into some problem with oil companies and zoning.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWant me to fight the oil companies?\u201d Steve says.\u00a0\u201cI can do that.\u201d Tony laughs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAs much as I would love that, I don\u2019t want to bail you out of jail. Besides, we have a movie premiere to go to next week, and you still need to get fitted for the suit.\u201d Steve makes a noise of disapproval.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just wear one from my closet? I doubt people would notice if it was the same black one.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThis one is a bit more\u2026daring. How do you feel about purple?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c\u2026interested. Fitting tomorrow then? I\u2019m off work at two.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>The rest of the night is pretty boring, as far as nights go. Tony listens to a message Peter sent him about his Spider-Man patrol, and Steve texts Bucky about the mission he\u2019s on. It must not be too high-stakes, because he sends snapchat videos of Clint dancing to Whitney Houston in the middle of a blizzard.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both ridiculous,\u201d Tony says. He\u2019s wearing readers while he has one of his cheesy books with him. He and Pepper have a reading group, and right now they\u2019re on murder-mystery books with cheesy titles. Steve\u2019s catching up on a word search app.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The last kiss at night. When they\u2019re both in bed and Tony yawns for the first time. Steve will shut off the lamp.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to bed, dear.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019re sleepy. And besides, going to bed with you is never too bad.\u201d He gets one last kiss.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLove you always, Tony.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLove you forever, Steve.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>(It <i>is </i>a pretty good kiss.

(They set a limit, obviously. Whether or not it\u2019s actually followed is usually up to the urgency.) Steve or Tony will text that they\u2019re late, a kiss at the end.

                "content": "<p>Steve&rsquo;s not really a talker. Tony knows this. Steve prefers to act rather than speak, and Tony&rsquo;s not really going to argue, especially when Steve&rsquo;s so good at actions.&nbsp;</p><p>But when they&rsquo;re alone, Steve will talk a bit. Just a few compliments here and there. Some fun little anecdotes about his day. Tony loves it, honestly. He doesn&rsquo;t tell Steve he does, just hums and works his way around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The kisses are always spread out over the day, never at once. That&rsquo;s how they prefer it.&nbsp;</p><p>It starts in the morning. Steve wakes Tony up at six in the morning&ndash;a shitty time, but Tony does put up with it for kisses&ndash;and he says&nbsp;&ldquo;Good morning, love. I&rsquo;m going on my run, I&rsquo;ll text you when I&rsquo;m coming back.&rdquo; And then kiss. Tony likes it.&nbsp;</p><p>He can&rsquo;t go back to sleep, and he loves to make breakfast. So he&rsquo;ll usually get started on Steve&rsquo;s breakfast, which is basically cooking for two. Four slices of toast, four eggs, two strips of bacon, (he&rsquo;s not making more, Steve doesn&rsquo;t need that much) and a bowl of fruit. He also makes coffee, which is more for him.&nbsp;</p><p>At around six forty, Steve will come back, shower, and drop a kiss on Tony&rsquo;s temple.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Run was good. I got to pet three dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;More than yesterday, babe, good for you.&rdquo; Steve grins, nabbing his plate.&nbsp;&ldquo;No more bacon?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No more bacon,&rdquo; Tony says.&nbsp;&ldquo;If I have to watch what I&rsquo;m eating, so do you. Besides, you know you can make more, lazy bones.&rdquo; Steve rolls his eyes. He pours the coffee for Tony, with the required tablespoon of cream and another of sugar.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The next kiss is when Steve drops by SI on his lunch break. The new PA, Gilda, lets him in with no thought. Just waves him through.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Missed you,&rdquo; Steve says.&nbsp;&ldquo;Brought lunch.&rdquo; Usually, it&rsquo;s something he made before he went to work. Sometimes it&rsquo;s something from a shop that Tony likes. Either way, wonderful.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I saw you at breakfast.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And yet, not until lunch. Time differences, babe.&rdquo; Tony likes the pet names. Steve lives for them. He uses the usual ones&ndash;honey, babe, sweetheart, darling, love, all of that. Tony loves it. It means more to him than he knows, perhaps because Steve doesn&rsquo;t say things unless he <i>really </i>means them.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Lunch passes quickly, with Steve being late and the suit ruffled a little bit always. Natasha says she and Maria always make fun of him.&nbsp;</p><p>Next kiss is usually a text from either of them. Both love their work, and so Steve may be staying thirty minutes later or Tony will.
