No wonder people always seemed to flock to\nyou.</p><p>And then you&rsquo;re placing a chaste\nkiss onto your boyfriend&rsquo;s cheek and walking towards the kitchen, towards\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>You stop a few feet in front of\nPeter, smiling still.</p><p>And he wants to speak, to make\neverything less awkward, but what is he going to say?\u00a0</p><p><i>You look gorgeous</i>? That would be\nstating the obvious. Something you must&rsquo;ve heard at least a hundred times\nalready today.</p><p>Something funny? Charming? <i>Mr.\nStark would be.</i></p><p>You arch a brow at him, smile\ncurling into an amused little smirk, watching him open his mouth and close it\nagain when nothing comes out.\u00a0</p><p>He falters for a moment, seemingly\nlost in thought and you can&rsquo;t help but find it somewhat cute.</p><p><i>Great.</i> He hasn&rsquo;t even spoken to you\nyet and he&rsquo;s already tongue tied.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello- Uh, hi.&rdquo; He\nmanages finally, raising his hand and offering you an awkward little wave.\n&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he clears his throat, fumbling with his hands, &ldquo;Come here\noften?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes widen slightly. <i>Come here\noften?</i> He\u00a0wants to slap himself.</p><p>You snort- why is that so cute- and\nhe feels like dying. Melting into the dirtied kitchen floor and evaporating\ninto the atmosphere sounded great right about then.</p><p>&ldquo;The kitchen? Why yes,\nwhenever I want a drink.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The ki-&rdquo; he turns his\nhead so fast you&rsquo;re surprised he doesn&rsquo;t get a whiplash, noticing with horror\nthat he&rsquo;s been blocking the closest entry for the entire time, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m\nsorry! I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;\nyou smile at him in a way that makes the sun look dull, it&rsquo;s contagious.\n&ldquo;Relax, Peter. You&rsquo;ll live longer.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that you move past him and\ninto the kitchen, completely missing how Peter&rsquo;s own smile stretches to an\nalmost impossible length.</p><p>&ldquo;Still wanna leave?&rdquo; Ned\nquips from behind Peter, watching his best friend turn to face him with a grin\nof his own.</p><p>Peter ignores his question\ncompletely. &ldquo;She knows my name!&rdquo; His eyes widen as if he&rsquo;s only now\nstarting to fully register that fact. &ldquo;How does- she knows <i>my name</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>His hands rise to rest on his hair,\nan elated laugh escaping his lips. He&rsquo;s sure Ned can hear his heart hammering\nagainst his rib cage over the booming music.</p><p>&ldquo;She sure does,&rdquo; Ned\nsupplies amusedly, reaching out to switch out Peter&rsquo;s cup with his own,\n&ldquo;So, staying then?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods, watching Ned outstretch\nhis arm and meeting him halfway, clinking their plastic cups together.\u00a0</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Sweet cheeks, truth or\ndare?&rdquo;</p><p>Flash smirks from the corner of the\ncouch he stands leaning against.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Dare,&rdquo; you smirk back,\ndowning the remains of your cup, gladly accepting another one from one of the\nnewer members of your cheer team.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I dare you,&rdquo; Flash\npauses, brows twitching in careful consideration before his eyes light up,\n&ldquo;I dare you,&rdquo; he repeats louder, more sure, &ldquo;to get rid of your\nshirt and walk around in a bra for the rest of the party!&rdquo;</p><p>Wolf whistles and cheers follow his\ndare and you roll your eyes, smirking still.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;m even\nwearing a bra?&rdquo; You arch a brow and watch Flash choke on his drink, some\nchuckles and giggles following your reply.\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, you give your cup to\nthe closest jock for him to hold, fingers tugging at your shirt to pull it over\nyour head.\u00a0</p><p>You throw it in Flash&rsquo;s face, more\nwhistles and laughter following as you reach for your cup again.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, my turn.&rdquo; You\nlick your lips and look around the room, eyes halting on Peter for a second,\nthen two. Then two more, before moving on and stopping on your boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; you begin\nteasingly, &ldquo;truth or dare?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dare,&rdquo; he smirks,\nchugging down his own beverage before accepting a new bottle of beer from one\nof the jocks.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I dare you,&rdquo; you allow\none of the jocks to lean in and whisper something into your ear,\n&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; you agree, &ldquo;I dare you to strip and run a round around\nthe block.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes light up with something\nakin to amusement? Peter&rsquo;s not sure anymore in his own slightly buzzed state, and\nhe begins stripping, stopping when he&rsquo;s only in his boxers.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Completely?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; you wave him off,\n&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t want you to surrender your last shards of dignity so soon.&rdquo;</p><p>He grins and marches to the door,\nconfidently swinging it open and saluting before setting into a wobbly\njog.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Flash grins,\n&ldquo;who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Hey, have you seen-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo; Ned motions\nup, smiling knowingly.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;With-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I think he got lost.\nMaybe found a bush to sleep in?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods, brows creasing in\nworry. &ldquo;Is she alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t she be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s been gone for\npretty long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Ned raises his\nbrows, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t even try to seem not totally creepy. Love it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter ignores his quip,\nrepositioning the bottle of booze under his arm. &ldquo;Maybe I should check on\nher?&rdquo;</p><p>Ned shrugs, &ldquo;You do you,\nbud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have fun.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods absently, slowly pushing\npast the various party goers and wobbly making his way up the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t find you in the first\ntwo bedrooms, going for the third when he notices the open window to his left.</p><p>He steps forward and peeks outside,\nfinding you sitting on the roof, looking at the stars.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hey-&rdquo; You turn to face him,\nand he falters for a moment, &ldquo;Uh, would you like some company?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; you smile at him\nand he returns the gesture, carefully climbing out the window and joining you\non the roof.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing on the\nroof anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to get some fresh\nair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the roof?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo; You pop the &lsquo;p&rsquo;\nand Peter chuckles, a rush of hot affection bubbling up, wrapping itself around\nhis heart, and he smiles. <i>Of course, you did.</i>\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it is beautiful.&rdquo;\nHe sneaks a quick look at you and watches your own smile widen in\nagreement.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it is.&rdquo;</p><p>Comfortable silence settles between\nthe two of you, Peter occasionally shifting his eyes to your form whenever you\ndecide to mouth along to the lyrics of whatever song is playing in the background.</p><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s play a game,\u201d you pipe\nup after a while, suddenly turning and sitting cross-legged to face him\ndirectly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>A\ngame</i>?\u201d</p><p>You giggle, and the sound makes\nsomething clench in his chest, not unpleasant, but noticeable and new. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I said.\u201d</p><p>He answers with a smile, \u201cWhat kind\nof game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever?&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;Never have I ever?&rdquo; He\nrepeats slowly, startling when you reach for his arm to take the bottle of\ncheap whiskey he took with.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you confirm,\n&ldquo;you say something that you&rsquo;ve never done and if I have done it, I&rsquo;ll have\nto take a shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; you open the now\nlukewarm bottle and smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first. Never have I ever stolen\nsomething from a shop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations. Your\nturn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I ever,&rdquo; he\nwrinkles his nose, eyes lighting up with an idea, &ldquo;Never have I ever met anyone greater than Tony Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>You huff incredulously, taking a\nbig gulp. &ldquo;You have met Tony Stark? Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods enthusiastically.\n&ldquo;Yeah, Mr. Stark and I worked together a couple of times. He&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt about that,&rdquo;\nyou agree. &ldquo;Ok, my turn. Never have I ever gone skinny-dipping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Somehow, not even\nsurprised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I ever cheated on\na test.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, lay it on me,&rdquo; you\nchuckle, taking another drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. Never have I ever jumped\nfrom a roof.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sheepishly reaches for the\nbottle, taking a big gulp.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Seriously?</i>&rdquo; You wrinkle your nose at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell me about\nit sometime.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bites the inside of his cheek\nto keep from smiling too hard at the mention of a next time.</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I ever driven\nwhile drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. I have never,&rdquo; you\nraise your hands with a glint in your eyes, &ldquo;and quite frankly I&rsquo;m\ninsulted you&rsquo;d even think you&rsquo;d get me with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckles bashfully.</p><p>\u201cOk. Hmm. Never have I ever been given a jacket when I\nwas cold.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Are you </i>cold?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kinda?&rdquo;</p><p>He drapes his jacket over you,\nsmiling at you in his cute dopey way at the way the sleeves are far too big and\nyou just kind of sink into it.</p><p>\u201cNow you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet.&ldquo;</p><p><i>So are you.</i> Somehow, he has enough self-awareness\nto not voice his thoughts out loud. So, instead, he takes a shot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he clears his throat,\ncheeks flushing, \u201cnever have I ever been kissed.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows rise, and it may be\nthe alcohol talking but goddamn you look even more stunning when you lean\nforward and pout in confusion. \u201c<i>Never?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d\nHe admits and the smile that follows takes his breath\naway.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Gotta say, I&rsquo;m\nsurprised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrug, taking a gulp. &ldquo;I\njust thought someone as nice as you would have girls throwing themselves at him.&rdquo;\nAnd after a beat, &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re pretty cute, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;\nHe&rsquo;s flushed pink, unsure what to say. Heart hammering\nloud enough for you to hear it. He&rsquo;s sure of it.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you slowly crawl closer,\nreaching out to place a cool hand onto his cheek and turning his head to face\nyou entirely, \u201cit&rsquo;s nothing that can&rsquo;t be fixed.\u201d</p><p><i>Does she mean-?</i></p><p>His eyes flutter shut when you lean in and kiss him, his hand cupping your jaw in a much too tender way.\u00a0</p><p><i>Oh, she does.</i> And then all other\nsemi-coherent thoughts leave him and he relaxes, feeling you smile against his\nmouth.</p><p>Your lips make his whole body feel\nwarm, like he is sitting directly next to the sun. Your hand on his jaw feels\ncool though and the contrast is oddly intoxicating.</p><p>Your lips move against his\nsmoothly, expertly, wonderfully. His trying to copy your motions, eager to\nlearn. There\u2019s no tongue- there\u2019s nothing inherently sexual about the\nsituation- but his heart is pounding, and his stomach is full of\nbutterflies.\u00a0</p><p>He&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s blushing like mad by\nnow and this time it has absolutely nothing to do with embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>And then you&rsquo;re gripping at the\ncollar of his shirt and drawing him closer, dragging your thumb over cheek\nbefore releasing him from your spell and leaning back.</p><p>&ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; you grin,\n&ldquo;now you have.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>The rest of the night goes by in a\nblur, but it&rsquo;s the kiss that lingers on his mind and, quite frankly, his\nlips.\u00a0</p><p>He still must resist the urge to\ntouch them when he&rsquo;s standing in front of his locker in school, settling for\nbiting his lip instead when they start to tingle at the memory.\u00a0</p><p>Ned shakes his head, in what he&rsquo;s\nnot sure. Disapproval perhaps? He <i>did </i>tell him after all.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He decides to ask\nfinally, taking a step back and closing his locker.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re head over heels and\nshe&rsquo;s taken. <i>Not\n</i>cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? - I&rsquo;m not-&rdquo; but\nthen he sees you at the other end of the hall and his words die in his throat\nentirely.\u00a0</p><p>He watches as you kiss your boyfriend,\narms slung around his shoulders, while his hold you snugly by the\nwaist.\u00a0And when you part, he sees you smiling at him and it makes him look\naway, feeling like he&rsquo;s intruding.\u00a0</p><p>Ned watches with a sympathetic\nsmile, reaching out to pat him on the back. &ldquo;Told you,&rdquo; he whispers\nsoftly, turning his gaze away from Peter when he hears your heels approaching.</p><p>He gives you a meaningful look and\na small nod before offering Peter another supportive pat and walking off, giving you some privacy.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Uh.\nHi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you smile and\nreach into your backpack, pulling out his jacket. &ldquo;Here. It&rsquo;s washed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Thank you for giving it\nto me.&rdquo; You inhale softly, biting at your lower lip before dragging your\neyes back to his. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; you begin, sounding so confident and\nuncomfortable at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;What happened yesterday needs\nto stay between us, ok? I was pretty drunk and I- I don&rsquo;t want it getting out.\nYou understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh. Yeah. Of course. Totally.\nI got it. My lips are sealed.&rdquo;</p><p>He makes a motion of zipping his\nlips and throwing away the key. You giggle gently and he&rsquo;d be lying if he\ndidn&rsquo;t feel his heart breaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; you turn to\nwalk away, &ldquo;[Y/N]?&rdquo;</p><p>You turn back to face him, tilting\nyour head in question, and somehow all courage leaves him again and he raises\nhis jacket a little higher and smiles awkwardly. &ldquo;Thanks again. For the\njacket, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo; And\nwith that you turn and disappear in the crowd and Peter has to bite the inside\nof his cheek again.</p><p>This time though to keep from\ncrying.</p><p><i>Foolish boy, to think\nthat something that started with a kiss would end with one.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tomhollandisdaddy:rAN2kUv_d_KCPmUpKPZsDg:Zk3CUd2QclQwd\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53b3ec4ab4d23f07339e1b757ac2151f/tumblr_ox8ccqKJPR1wu3svzo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"380\"/></figure><h2>Tag:\u00a0</h2><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGXhJXj-elfpExWasSJ6OXA\">@sebastians-stanner</a>, @nottheopera, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> \u00a0\n\n<br/></p>",

Maybe coming here wasn\u2019t\nsuch a good idea after all,\u201d Peter gulps, hands reaching out to fumble at\nthe collar of his jacket for the hundredth time in the past 5 minutes.\u00a0</p><p>Ned simply rolls his eyes,\n\u201cRelax.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"But-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d he pushes a\ndrink into Peter\u2019s hands, shoving him back towards the crowded living room, he\ngives up in the doorway, \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not here anyway and\nI really need to do my physics homework and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rambling. And she\u2019s\ngonna show up. You know how her boyfriend is, he\u2019s going to make a show of\narriving late with her on his arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, reminding me of her\nboyfriend doesn\u2019t help much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone has to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say about\nthe devil?\u201d Ned motions to the door, watching as you appear in the\ndoorway, your boyfriend straight behind you, shamelessly watching your\nass.\u00a0</p><p>He isn\u2019t the only one staring, but\nyou take it all in stride once more, lips quirking into a smile.\u00a0</p><p>You give off the air of a queen then,\ncharming and so unfairly gorgeous. No wonder people always seemed to flock to\nyou.</p><p>And then you\u2019re placing a chaste\nkiss onto your boyfriend\u2019s cheek and walking towards the kitchen, towards\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>You stop a few feet in front of\nPeter, smiling still.</p><p>And he wants to speak, to make\neverything less awkward, but what is he going to say?\u00a0</p><p><i>You look gorgeous</i>? That would be\nstating the obvious. Something you must\u2019ve heard at least a hundred times\nalready today.</p><p>Something funny? Charming? <i>Mr.\nStark would be.</i></p><p>You arch a brow at him, smile\ncurling into an amused little smirk, watching him open his mouth and close it\nagain when nothing comes out.\u00a0</p><p>He falters for a moment, seemingly\nlost in thought and you can\u2019t help but find it somewhat cute.</p><p><i>Great.</i> He hasn\u2019t even spoken to you\nyet and he\u2019s already tongue tied.</p><p>\u201cHello- Uh, hi.\u201d He\nmanages finally, raising his hand and offering you an awkward little wave.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he clears his throat, fumbling with his hands, \u201cCome here\noften?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen slightly. <i>Come here\noften?</i> He\u00a0wants to slap himself.</p><p>You snort- why is that so cute- and\nhe feels like dying. Melting into the dirtied kitchen floor and evaporating\ninto the atmosphere sounded great right about then.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen? Why yes,\nwhenever I want a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ki-\u201d he turns his\nhead so fast you\u2019re surprised he doesn\u2019t get a whiplash, noticing with horror\nthat he\u2019s been blocking the closest entry for the entire time, \u201cOh, I\u2019m\nsorry! I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t,\u201d\nyou smile at him in a way that makes the sun look dull, it\u2019s contagious.\n\u201cRelax, Peter. You\u2019ll live longer.\u201d</p><p>And with that you move past him and\ninto the kitchen, completely missing how Peter\u2019s own smile stretches to an\nalmost impossible length.</p><p>\u201cStill wanna leave?\u201d Ned\nquips from behind Peter, watching his best friend turn to face him with a grin\nof his own.</p><p>Peter ignores his question\ncompletely. \u201cShe knows my name!\u201d His eyes widen as if he\u2019s only now\nstarting to fully register that fact. \u201cHow does- she knows <i>my name</i>!\u201d</p><p>His hands rise to rest on his hair,\nan elated laugh escaping his lips. He\u2019s sure Ned can hear his heart hammering\nagainst his rib cage over the booming music.</p><p>\u201cShe sure does,\u201d Ned\nsupplies amusedly, reaching out to switch out Peter\u2019s cup with his own,\n\u201cSo, staying then?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, watching Ned outstretch\nhis arm and meeting him halfway, clinking their plastic cups together.\u00a0</p><hr><p>\u201cSweet cheeks, truth or\ndare?\u201d</p><p>Flash smirks from the corner of the\ncouch he stands leaning against.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDare,\u201d you smirk back,\ndowning the remains of your cup, gladly accepting another one from one of the\nnewer members of your cheer team.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI dare you,\u201d Flash\npauses, brows twitching in careful consideration before his eyes light up,\n\u201cI dare you,\u201d he repeats louder, more sure, \u201cto get rid of your\nshirt and walk around in a bra for the rest of the party!\u201d</p><p>Wolf whistles and cheers follow his\ndare and you roll your eyes, smirking still.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m even\nwearing a bra?\u201d You arch a brow and watch Flash choke on his drink, some\nchuckles and giggles following your reply.\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, you give your cup to\nthe closest jock for him to hold, fingers tugging at your shirt to pull it over\nyour head.\u00a0</p><p>You throw it in Flash\u2019s face, more\nwhistles and laughter following as you reach for your cup again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, my turn.\u201d You\nlick your lips and look around the room, eyes halting on Peter for a second,\nthen two. Then two more, before moving on and stopping on your boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDear,\u201d you begin\nteasingly, \u201ctruth or dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare,\u201d he smirks,\nchugging down his own beverage before accepting a new bottle of beer from one\nof the jocks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI dare you,\u201d you allow\none of the jocks to lean in and whisper something into your ear,\n\u201cSure,\u201d you agree, \u201cI dare you to strip and run a round around\nthe block.\u201d</p><p>His eyes light up with something\nakin to amusement? Peter\u2019s not sure anymore in his own slightly buzzed state, and\nhe begins stripping, stopping when he\u2019s only in his boxers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCompletely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d you wave him off,\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t want you to surrender your last shards of dignity so soon.\u201d</p><p>He grins and marches to the door,\nconfidently swinging it open and saluting before setting into a wobbly\njog.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Flash grins,\n\u201cwho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cHey, have you seen-\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d Ned motions\nup, smiling knowingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWith-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think he got lost.\nMaybe found a bush to sleep in?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, brows creasing in\nworry. \u201cIs she alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s been gone for\npretty long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ned raises his\nbrows, \u201cdon\u2019t even try to seem not totally creepy. Love it.\u201d</p><p>Peter ignores his quip,\nrepositioning the bottle of booze under his arm. \u201cMaybe I should check on\nher?\u201d</p><p>Ned shrugs, \u201cYou do you,\nbud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods absently, slowly pushing\npast the various party goers and wobbly making his way up the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t find you in the first\ntwo bedrooms, going for the third when he notices the open window to his left.</p><p>He steps forward and peeks outside,\nfinding you sitting on the roof, looking at the stars.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey-\u201d You turn to face him,\nand he falters for a moment, \u201cUh, would you like some company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d you smile at him\nand he returns the gesture, carefully climbing out the window and joining you\non the roof.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing on the\nroof anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get some fresh\nair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d You pop the \u2018p\u2019\nand Peter chuckles, a rush of hot affection bubbling up, wrapping itself around\nhis heart, and he smiles. <i>Of course, you did.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, it is beautiful.\u201d\nHe sneaks a quick look at you and watches your own smile widen in\nagreement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>Comfortable silence settles between\nthe two of you, Peter occasionally shifting his eyes to your form whenever you\ndecide to mouth along to the lyrics of whatever song is playing in the background.</p><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s play a game,\u201d you pipe\nup after a while, suddenly turning and sitting cross-legged to face him\ndirectly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>A\ngame</i>?\u201d</p><p>You giggle, and the sound makes\nsomething clench in his chest, not unpleasant, but noticeable and new. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I said.\u201d</p><p>He answers with a smile, \u201cWhat kind\nof game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever?\u201c</p><p>\"Never have I ever?\u201d He\nrepeats slowly, startling when you reach for his arm to take the bottle of\ncheap whiskey he took with.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you confirm,\n\u201cyou say something that you\u2019ve never done and if I have done it, I\u2019ll have\nto take a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d you open the now\nlukewarm bottle and smile, \u201cI\u2019ll go first.

Your\nturn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever,\u201d he\nwrinkles his nose, eyes lighting up with an idea, \u201cNever have I ever met anyone greater than Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>You huff incredulously, taking a\nbig gulp. \u201cYou have met Tony Stark? Really?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods enthusiastically.\n\u201cYeah, Mr. Stark and I worked together a couple of times. He\u2019s awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt about that,\u201d\nyou agree. \u201cOk, my turn. Never have I ever gone skinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow, not even\nsurprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever cheated on\na test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, lay it on me,\u201d you\nchuckle, taking another drink.</p><p>\u201cOk. Never have I ever jumped\nfrom a roof.\u201d</p><p>Peter sheepishly reaches for the\nbottle, taking a big gulp.</p><p>\u201c<i>Seriously?</i>\u201d You wrinkle your nose at him.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me about\nit sometime.\u201d</p><p>Peter bites the inside of his cheek\nto keep from smiling too hard at the mention of a next time.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever driven\nwhile drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I have never,\u201d you\nraise your hands with a glint in your eyes, \u201cand quite frankly I\u2019m\ninsulted you\u2019d even think you\u2019d get me with that.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckles bashfully.</p><p>\u201cOk. Hmm. Never have I ever been given a jacket when I\nwas cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Are you </i>cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda?\u201d</p><p>He drapes his jacket over you,\nsmiling at you in his cute dopey way at the way the sleeves are far too big and\nyou just kind of sink into it.</p><p>\u201cNow you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet.\u201c</p><p><i>So are you.</i> Somehow, he has enough self-awareness\nto not voice his thoughts out loud. So, instead, he takes a shot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he clears his throat,\ncheeks flushing, \u201cnever have I ever been kissed.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows rise, and it may be\nthe alcohol talking but goddamn you look even more stunning when you lean\nforward and pout in confusion. \u201c<i>Never?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d\nHe admits and the smile that follows takes his breath\naway.\u00a0</p><p>\"Gotta say, I\u2019m\nsurprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>You shrug, taking a gulp. \u201cI\njust thought someone as nice as you would have girls throwing themselves at him.\u201d\nAnd after a beat, \u201cAnd you\u2019re pretty cute, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d\nHe\u2019s flushed pink, unsure what to say. Heart hammering\nloud enough for you to hear it. He\u2019s sure of it.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you slowly crawl closer,\nreaching out to place a cool hand onto his cheek and turning his head to face\nyou entirely, \u201cit\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d</p><p><i>Does she mean-?</i></p><p>His eyes flutter shut when you lean in and kiss him, his hand cupping your jaw in a much too tender way.\u00a0</p><p><i>Oh, she does.</i> And then all other\nsemi-coherent thoughts leave him and he relaxes, feeling you smile against his\nmouth.</p><p>Your lips make his whole body feel\nwarm, like he is sitting directly next to the sun. Your hand on his jaw feels\ncool though and the contrast is oddly intoxicating.</p><p>Your lips move against his\nsmoothly, expertly, wonderfully. His trying to copy your motions, eager to\nlearn. There\u2019s no tongue- there\u2019s nothing inherently sexual about the\nsituation- but his heart is pounding, and his stomach is full of\nbutterflies.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s sure he\u2019s blushing like mad by\nnow and this time it has absolutely nothing to do with embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>And then you\u2019re gripping at the\ncollar of his shirt and drawing him closer, dragging your thumb over cheek\nbefore releasing him from your spell and leaning back.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d you grin,\n\u201cnow you have.\u201d</p><hr><p>The rest of the night goes by in a\nblur, but it\u2019s the kiss that lingers on his mind and, quite frankly, his\nlips.\u00a0</p><p>He still must resist the urge to\ntouch them when he\u2019s standing in front of his locker in school, settling for\nbiting his lip instead when they start to tingle at the memory.\u00a0</p><p>Ned shakes his head, in what he\u2019s\nnot sure. Disapproval perhaps? He <i>did </i>tell him after all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He decides to ask\nfinally, taking a step back and closing his locker.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re head over heels and\nshe\u2019s taken. <i>Not\n</i>cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? - I\u2019m not-\u201d but\nthen he sees you at the other end of the hall and his words die in his throat\nentirely.\u00a0</p><p>He watches as you kiss your boyfriend,\narms slung around his shoulders, while his hold you snugly by the\nwaist.\u00a0And when you part, he sees you smiling at him and it makes him look\naway, feeling like he\u2019s intruding.\u00a0</p><p>Ned watches with a sympathetic\nsmile, reaching out to pat him on the back. \u201cTold you,\u201d he whispers\nsoftly, turning his gaze away from Peter when he hears your heels approaching.</p><p>He gives you a meaningful look and\na small nod before offering Peter another supportive pat and walking off, giving you some privacy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh.\nHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you smile and\nreach into your backpack, pulling out his jacket. \u201cHere. It\u2019s washed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you for giving it\nto me.\u201d You inhale softly, biting at your lower lip before dragging your\neyes back to his. \u201cListen,\u201d you begin, sounding so confident and\nuncomfortable at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened yesterday needs\nto stay between us, ok? I was pretty drunk and I- I don\u2019t want it getting out.\nYou understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah. Of course. Totally.\nI got it. My lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>He makes a motion of zipping his\nlips and throwing away the key. You giggle gently and he\u2019d be lying if he\ndidn\u2019t feel his heart breaking.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you turn to\nwalk away, \u201c[Y/N]?\u201d</p><p>You turn back to face him, tilting\nyour head in question, and somehow all courage leaves him again and he raises\nhis jacket a little higher and smiles awkwardly. \u201cThanks again. For the\njacket, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d And\nwith that you turn and disappear in the crowd and Peter has to bite the inside\nof his cheek again.</p><p>This time though to keep from\ncrying.</p><p><i>Foolish boy, to think\nthat something that started with a kiss would end with one.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tomhollandisdaddy:rAN2kUv_d_KCPmUpKPZsDg:Zk3CUd2QclQwd\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53b3ec4ab4d23f07339e1b757ac2151f/tumblr_ox8ccqKJPR1wu3svzo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"380\"></figure><h2>Tag:\u00a0</h2><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGXhJXj-elfpExWasSJ6OXA\">@sebastians-stanner</a>, @nottheopera, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> \u00a0\n\n<br></p>",

No wonder people always seemed to flock to\nyou.</p><p>And then you\u2019re placing a chaste\nkiss onto your boyfriend\u2019s cheek and walking towards the kitchen, towards\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>You stop a few feet in front of\nPeter, smiling still.</p><p>And he wants to speak, to make\neverything less awkward, but what is he going to say?\u00a0</p><p><i>You look gorgeous</i>? That would be\nstating the obvious. Something you must\u2019ve heard at least a hundred times\nalready today.</p><p>Something funny? Charming? <i>Mr.\nStark would be.</i></p><p>You arch a brow at him, smile\ncurling into an amused little smirk, watching him open his mouth and close it\nagain when nothing comes out.\u00a0</p><p>He falters for a moment, seemingly\nlost in thought and you can\u2019t help but find it somewhat cute.</p><p><i>Great.</i> He hasn\u2019t even spoken to you\nyet and he\u2019s already tongue tied.</p><p>\u201cHello- Uh, hi.\u201d He\nmanages finally, raising his hand and offering you an awkward little wave.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he clears his throat, fumbling with his hands, \u201cCome here\noften?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen slightly. <i>Come here\noften?</i> He\u00a0wants to slap himself.</p><p>You snort- why is that so cute- and\nhe feels like dying. Melting into the dirtied kitchen floor and evaporating\ninto the atmosphere sounded great right about then.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen? Why yes,\nwhenever I want a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ki-\u201d he turns his\nhead so fast you\u2019re surprised he doesn\u2019t get a whiplash, noticing with horror\nthat he\u2019s been blocking the closest entry for the entire time, \u201cOh, I\u2019m\nsorry! I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t,\u201d\nyou smile at him in a way that makes the sun look dull, it\u2019s contagious.\n\u201cRelax, Peter. You\u2019ll live longer.\u201d</p><p>And with that you move past him and\ninto the kitchen, completely missing how Peter\u2019s own smile stretches to an\nalmost impossible length.</p><p>\u201cStill wanna leave?\u201d Ned\nquips from behind Peter, watching his best friend turn to face him with a grin\nof his own.</p><p>Peter ignores his question\ncompletely. \u201cShe knows my name!\u201d His eyes widen as if he\u2019s only now\nstarting to fully register that fact. \u201cHow does- she knows <i>my name</i>!\u201d</p><p>His hands rise to rest on his hair,\nan elated laugh escaping his lips.

Then two more, before moving on and stopping on your boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDear,\u201d you begin\nteasingly, \u201ctruth or dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare,\u201d he smirks,\nchugging down his own beverage before accepting a new bottle of beer from one\nof the jocks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI dare you,\u201d you allow\none of the jocks to lean in and whisper something into your ear,\n\u201cSure,\u201d you agree, \u201cI dare you to strip and run a round around\nthe block.\u201d</p><p>His eyes light up with something\nakin to amusement? Peter\u2019s not sure anymore in his own slightly buzzed state, and\nhe begins stripping, stopping when he\u2019s only in his boxers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCompletely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d you wave him off,\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t want you to surrender your last shards of dignity so soon.\u201d</p><p>He grins and marches to the door,\nconfidently swinging it open and saluting before setting into a wobbly\njog.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Flash grins,\n\u201cwho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cHey, have you seen-\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d Ned motions\nup, smiling knowingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWith-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think he got lost.\nMaybe found a bush to sleep in?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, brows creasing in\nworry. \u201cIs she alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s been gone for\npretty long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ned raises his\nbrows, \u201cdon\u2019t even try to seem not totally creepy. Love it.\u201d</p><p>Peter ignores his quip,\nrepositioning the bottle of booze under his arm. \u201cMaybe I should check on\nher?\u201d</p><p>Ned shrugs, \u201cYou do you,\nbud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods absently, slowly pushing\npast the various party goers and wobbly making his way up the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t find you in the first\ntwo bedrooms, going for the third when he notices the open window to his left.</p><p>He steps forward and peeks outside,\nfinding you sitting on the roof, looking at the stars.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey-\u201d You turn to face him,\nand he falters for a moment, \u201cUh, would you like some company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d you smile at him\nand he returns the gesture, carefully climbing out the window and joining you\non the roof.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing on the\nroof anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get some fresh\nair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d You pop the \u2018p\u2019\nand Peter chuckles, a rush of hot affection bubbling up, wrapping itself around\nhis heart, and he smiles. <i>Of course, you did.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, it is beautiful.\u201d\nHe sneaks a quick look at you and watches your own smile widen in\nagreement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>Comfortable silence settles between\nthe two of you, Peter occasionally shifting his eyes to your form whenever you\ndecide to mouth along to the lyrics of whatever song is playing in the background.</p><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s play a game,\u201d you pipe\nup after a while, suddenly turning and sitting cross-legged to face him\ndirectly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>A\ngame</i>?\u201d</p><p>You giggle, and the sound makes\nsomething clench in his chest, not unpleasant, but noticeable and new. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I said.\u201d</p><p>He answers with a smile, \u201cWhat kind\nof game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever?\u201c</p><p>\"Never have I ever?\u201d He\nrepeats slowly, startling when you reach for his arm to take the bottle of\ncheap whiskey he took with.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d you confirm,\n\u201cyou say something that you\u2019ve never done and if I have done it, I\u2019ll have\nto take a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d you open the now\nlukewarm bottle and smile, \u201cI\u2019ll go first.

Your\nturn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever,\u201d he\nwrinkles his nose, eyes lighting up with an idea, \u201cNever have I ever met anyone greater than Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>You huff incredulously, taking a\nbig gulp. \u201cYou have met Tony Stark? Really?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods enthusiastically.\n\u201cYeah, Mr. Stark and I worked together a couple of times. He\u2019s awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt about that,\u201d\nyou agree. \u201cOk, my turn. Never have I ever gone skinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow, not even\nsurprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever cheated on\na test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, lay it on me,\u201d you\nchuckle, taking another drink.</p><p>\u201cOk. Never have I ever jumped\nfrom a roof.\u201d</p><p>Peter sheepishly reaches for the\nbottle, taking a big gulp.</p><p>\u201c<i>Seriously?</i>\u201d You wrinkle your nose at him.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me about\nit sometime.\u201d</p><p>Peter bites the inside of his cheek\nto keep from smiling too hard at the mention of a next time.</p><p>\u201cNever have I ever driven\nwhile drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I have never,\u201d you\nraise your hands with a glint in your eyes, \u201cand quite frankly I\u2019m\ninsulted you\u2019d even think you\u2019d get me with that.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckles bashfully.</p><p>\u201cOk. Hmm. Never have I ever been given a jacket when I\nwas cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Are you </i>cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda?\u201d</p><p>He drapes his jacket over you,\nsmiling at you in his cute dopey way at the way the sleeves are far too big and\nyou just kind of sink into it.</p><p>\u201cNow you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet.\u201c</p><p><i>So are you.</i> Somehow, he has enough self-awareness\nto not voice his thoughts out loud. So, instead, he takes a shot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he clears his throat,\ncheeks flushing, \u201cnever have I ever been kissed.\u201d</p><p>Your eyebrows rise, and it may be\nthe alcohol talking but goddamn you look even more stunning when you lean\nforward and pout in confusion. \u201c<i>Never?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d\nHe admits and the smile that follows takes his breath\naway.\u00a0</p><p>\"Gotta say, I\u2019m\nsurprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>You shrug, taking a gulp. \u201cI\njust thought someone as nice as you would have girls throwing themselves at him.\u201d\nAnd after a beat, \u201cAnd you\u2019re pretty cute, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d\nHe\u2019s flushed pink, unsure what to say. Heart hammering\nloud enough for you to hear it. He\u2019s sure of it.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you slowly crawl closer,\nreaching out to place a cool hand onto his cheek and turning his head to face\nyou entirely, \u201cit\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d</p><p><i>Does she mean-?</i></p><p>His eyes flutter shut when you lean in and kiss him, his hand cupping your jaw in a much too tender way.\u00a0</p><p><i>Oh, she does.</i> And then all other\nsemi-coherent thoughts leave him and he relaxes, feeling you smile against his\nmouth.</p><p>Your lips make his whole body feel\nwarm, like he is sitting directly next to the sun. Your hand on his jaw feels\ncool though and the contrast is oddly intoxicating.</p><p>Your lips move against his\nsmoothly, expertly, wonderfully. His trying to copy your motions, eager to\nlearn. There\u2019s no tongue- there\u2019s nothing inherently sexual about the\nsituation- but his heart is pounding, and his stomach is full of\nbutterflies.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s sure he\u2019s blushing like mad by\nnow and this time it has absolutely nothing to do with embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>And then you\u2019re gripping at the\ncollar of his shirt and drawing him closer, dragging your thumb over cheek\nbefore releasing him from your spell and leaning back.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d you grin,\n\u201cnow you have.\u201d</p><hr><p>The rest of the night goes by in a\nblur, but it\u2019s the kiss that lingers on his mind and, quite frankly, his\nlips.\u00a0</p><p>He still must resist the urge to\ntouch them when he\u2019s standing in front of his locker in school, settling for\nbiting his lip instead when they start to tingle at the memory.\u00a0</p><p>Ned shakes his head, in what he\u2019s\nnot sure. Disapproval perhaps? He <i>did </i>tell him after all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He decides to ask\nfinally, taking a step back and closing his locker.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re head over heels and\nshe\u2019s taken. <i>Not\n</i>cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? - I\u2019m not-\u201d but\nthen he sees you at the other end of the hall and his words die in his throat\nentirely.\u00a0</p><p>He watches as you kiss your boyfriend,\narms slung around his shoulders, while his hold you snugly by the\nwaist.\u00a0And when you part, he sees you smiling at him and it makes him look\naway, feeling like he\u2019s intruding.\u00a0</p><p>Ned watches with a sympathetic\nsmile, reaching out to pat him on the back. \u201cTold you,\u201d he whispers\nsoftly, turning his gaze away from Peter when he hears your heels approaching.</p><p>He gives you a meaningful look and\na small nod before offering Peter another supportive pat and walking off, giving you some privacy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh.\nHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you smile and\nreach into your backpack, pulling out his jacket. \u201cHere. It\u2019s washed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you for giving it\nto me.\u201d You inhale softly, biting at your lower lip before dragging your\neyes back to his. \u201cListen,\u201d you begin, sounding so confident and\nuncomfortable at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened yesterday needs\nto stay between us, ok? I was pretty drunk and I- I don\u2019t want it getting out.\nYou understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah. Of course. Totally.\nI got it. My lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>He makes a motion of zipping his\nlips and throwing away the key. You giggle gently and he\u2019d be lying if he\ndidn\u2019t feel his heart breaking.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you turn to\nwalk away, \u201c[Y/N]?\u201d</p><p>You turn back to face him, tilting\nyour head in question, and somehow all courage leaves him again and he raises\nhis jacket a little higher and smiles awkwardly. \u201cThanks again. For the\njacket, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d And\nwith that you turn and disappear in the crowd and Peter has to bite the inside\nof his cheek again.</p><p>This time though to keep from\ncrying.</p><p><i>Foolish boy, to think\nthat something that started with a kiss would end with one.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tomhollandisdaddy:rAN2kUv_d_KCPmUpKPZsDg:Zk3CUd2QclQwd\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53b3ec4ab4d23f07339e1b757ac2151f/tumblr_ox8ccqKJPR1wu3svzo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"380\"></figure><h2>Tag:\u00a0</h2><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGXhJXj-elfpExWasSJ6OXA\">@sebastians-stanner</a>, @nottheopera, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> \u00a0\n\n<br></p>",

And then you send him a lazy smile and amused little\nwink, taking his staring in stride before turning back to your companions at\nyour table.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Ned sighs,\nclearing his throat, &ldquo;Earth to Peter.&rdquo; He waves his hand in front of\nthe boy&rsquo;s face, finally catching his attention.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Glad to see you&rsquo;ve decided to\njoin me in the present realm, buddy.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widen momentarily,\nthen he forcefully tears his eyes from you and the other cheerleaders and faces\nNed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, could you repeat\nthat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which part? You were gone for\nlike ten minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>He makes a show of shoving Ned,\nsnorting as Ned pushes him back with equal force.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Ned clears his\nthroat and moves to stand, motioning for Peter to do the same, &ldquo;I was\nasking whether you were going to the party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What party?&rdquo; Peter\nfurrows his brows, gripping at his bag and following Ned out the\ncafeteria.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Seriously?</i>&rdquo; The boy\nturns to send Peter an&nbsp;incredulous look over his shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter nods, &ldquo;Yes, that is the\nreason why you can hear confusion in my voice.&rdquo; He motions to his face for\nemphasis.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Krista&rsquo;s party? The one\neveryone was talking about for weeks? Does that ring a bell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unbelievable.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugs, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going\nto go anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? You were really going\nto miss the chance to spend some time with your sweet cheer-captain? That&rsquo;s\nhard to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna be there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Wow</i>,&rdquo; he shakes his\nhead, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t even try to hide it, that&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo; a sigh and another\nshake of his head, &ldquo;<i>of course</i> she&rsquo;s going to be there. Everyone cooler\nthan thou will. So, you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he rubs at the\nback of his neck, &ldquo;a couple of hours wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, would they?&rdquo;</p><p>Ned grins, &ldquo;and here I thought\nit&rsquo;d be hard to change your mind.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Ok. Maybe coming here wasn&rsquo;t\nsuch a good idea after all,&rdquo; Peter gulps, hands reaching out to fumble at\nthe collar of his jacket for the hundredth time in the past 5 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Ned simply rolls his eyes,\n&ldquo;Relax.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No buts,&rdquo; he pushes a\ndrink into Peter&rsquo;s hands, shoving him back towards the crowded living room, he\ngives up in the doorway, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s not here anyway and\nI really need to do my physics homework and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rambling. And she&rsquo;s\ngonna show up. You know how her boyfriend is, he&rsquo;s going to make a show of\narriving late with her on his arm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, reminding me of her\nboyfriend doesn&rsquo;t help much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, someone has to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what they say about\nthe devil?&rdquo; Ned motions to the door, watching as you appear in the\ndoorway, your boyfriend straight behind you, shamelessly watching your\nass.&nbsp;</p><p>He isn&rsquo;t the only one staring, but\nyou take it all in stride once more, lips quirking into a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>You give off the air of a queen then,\ncharming and so unfairly gorgeous. No wonder people always seemed to flock to\nyou.</p><p>And then you&rsquo;re placing a chaste\nkiss onto your boyfriend&rsquo;s cheek and walking towards the kitchen, towards\nhim.&nbsp;</p><p>You stop a few feet in front of\nPeter, smiling still.</p><p>And he wants to speak, to make\neverything less awkward, but what is he going to say?&nbsp;</p><p><i>You look gorgeous</i>? That would be\nstating the obvious. Something you must&rsquo;ve heard at least a hundred times\nalready today.</p><p>Something funny? Charming? <i>Mr.\nStark would be.</i></p><p>You arch a brow at him, smile\ncurling into an amused little smirk, watching him open his mouth and close it\nagain when nothing comes out.&nbsp;</p><p>He falters for a moment, seemingly\nlost in thought and you can&rsquo;t help but find it somewhat cute.</p><p><i>Great.</i> He hasn&rsquo;t even spoken to you\nyet and he&rsquo;s already tongue tied.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello- Uh, hi.&rdquo; He\nmanages finally, raising his hand and offering you an awkward little wave.\n&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he clears his throat, fumbling with his hands, &ldquo;Come here\noften?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes widen slightly. <i>Come here\noften?</i> He&nbsp;wants to slap himself.</p><p>You snort- why is that so cute- and\nhe feels like dying. Melting into the dirtied kitchen floor and evaporating\ninto the atmosphere sounded great right about then.</p><p>&ldquo;The kitchen? Why yes,\nwhenever I want a drink.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The ki-&rdquo; he turns his\nhead so fast you&rsquo;re surprised he doesn&rsquo;t get a whiplash, noticing with horror\nthat he&rsquo;s been blocking the closest entry for the entire time, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m\nsorry! I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;\nyou smile at him in a way that makes the sun look dull, it&rsquo;s contagious.\n&ldquo;Relax, Peter. You&rsquo;ll live longer.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that you move past him and\ninto the kitchen, completely missing how Peter&rsquo;s own smile stretches to an\nalmost impossible length.</p><p>&ldquo;Still wanna leave?&rdquo; Ned\nquips from behind Peter, watching his best friend turn to face him with a grin\nof his own.</p><p>Peter ignores his question\ncompletely. &ldquo;She knows my name!&rdquo; His eyes widen as if he&rsquo;s only now\nstarting to fully register that fact. &ldquo;How does- she knows <i>my name</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>His hands rise to rest on his hair,\nan elated laugh escaping his lips. He&rsquo;s sure Ned can hear his heart hammering\nagainst his rib cage over the booming music.</p><p>&ldquo;She sure does,&rdquo; Ned\nsupplies amusedly, reaching out to switch out Peter&rsquo;s cup with his own,\n&ldquo;So, staying then?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods, watching Ned outstretch\nhis arm and meeting him halfway, clinking their plastic cups together.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Sweet cheeks, truth or\ndare?&rdquo;</p><p>Flash smirks from the corner of the\ncouch he stands leaning against.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dare,&rdquo; you smirk back,\ndowning the remains of your cup, gladly accepting another one from one of the\nnewer members of your cheer team.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare you,&rdquo; Flash\npauses, brows twitching in careful consideration before his eyes light up,\n&ldquo;I dare you,&rdquo; he repeats louder, more sure, &ldquo;to get rid of your\nshirt and walk around in a bra for the rest of the party!&rdquo;</p><p>Wolf whistles and cheers follow his\ndare and you roll your eyes, smirking still.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;m even\nwearing a bra?&rdquo; You arch a brow and watch Flash choke on his drink, some\nchuckles and giggles following your reply.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, you give your cup to\nthe closest jock for him to hold, fingers tugging at your shirt to pull it over\nyour head.&nbsp;</p><p>You throw it in Flash&rsquo;s face, more\nwhistles and laughter following as you reach for your cup again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, my turn.&rdquo; You\nlick your lips and look around the room, eyes halting on Peter for a second,\nthen two. Then two more, before moving on and stopping on your boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; you begin\nteasingly, &ldquo;truth or dare?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dare,&rdquo; he smirks,\nchugging down his own beverage before accepting a new bottle of beer from one\nof the jocks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I dare you,&rdquo; you allow\none of the jocks to lean in and whisper something into your ear,\n&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; you agree, &ldquo;I dare you to strip and run a round around\nthe block.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes light up with something\nakin to amusement? Peter&rsquo;s not sure anymore in his own slightly buzzed state, and\nhe begins stripping, stopping when he&rsquo;s only in his boxers.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Completely?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; you wave him off,\n&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t want you to surrender your last shards of dignity so soon.&rdquo;</p><p>He grins and marches to the door,\nconfidently swinging it open and saluting before setting into a wobbly\njog.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Flash grins,\n&ldquo;who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Hey, have you seen-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo; Ned motions\nup, smiling knowingly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;With-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I think he got lost.\nMaybe found a bush to sleep in?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods, brows creasing in\nworry. &ldquo;Is she alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t she be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s been gone for\npretty long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Ned raises his\nbrows, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t even try to seem not totally creepy. Love it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter ignores his quip,\nrepositioning the bottle of booze under his arm. &ldquo;Maybe I should check on\nher?&rdquo;</p><p>Ned shrugs, &ldquo;You do you,\nbud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have fun.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods absently, slowly pushing\npast the various party goers and wobbly making his way up the stairs.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t find you in the first\ntwo bedrooms, going for the third when he notices the open window to his left.</p><p>He steps forward and peeks outside,\nfinding you sitting on the roof, looking at the stars.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey-&rdquo; You turn to face him,\nand he falters for a moment, &ldquo;Uh, would you like some company?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; you smile at him\nand he returns the gesture, carefully climbing out the window and joining you\non the roof.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing on the\nroof anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to get some fresh\nair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the roof?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo; You pop the &lsquo;p&rsquo;\nand Peter chuckles, a rush of hot affection bubbling up, wrapping itself around\nhis heart, and he smiles. <i>Of course, you did.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it is beautiful.&rdquo;\nHe sneaks a quick look at you and watches your own smile widen in\nagreement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it is.&rdquo;</p><p>Comfortable silence settles between\nthe two of you, Peter occasionally shifting his eyes to your form whenever you\ndecide to mouth along to the lyrics of whatever song is playing in the background.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s play a game,&rdquo; you pipe\nup after a while, suddenly turning and sitting cross-legged to face him\ndirectly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>A\ngame</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>You giggle, and the sound makes\nsomething clench in his chest, not unpleasant, but noticeable and new. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nwhat I said.&rdquo;</p><p>He answers with a smile, &ldquo;What kind\nof game?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I ever?&ldquo;</p><p>\"Never have I ever?&rdquo; He\nrepeats slowly, startling when you reach for his arm to take the bottle of\ncheap whiskey he took with.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you confirm,\n&ldquo;you say something that you&rsquo;ve never done and if I have done it, I&rsquo;ll have\nto take a shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; you open the now\nlukewarm bottle and smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first. Never have I ever stolen\nsomething from a shop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations. Your\nturn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I ever,&rdquo; he\nwrinkles his nose, eyes lighting up with an idea, &ldquo;Never have I ever met anyone greater than Tony Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>You huff incredulously, taking a\nbig gulp. &ldquo;You have met Tony Stark? Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods enthusiastically.\n&ldquo;Yeah, Mr. Stark and I worked together a couple of times. He&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt about that,&rdquo;\nyou agree. &ldquo;Ok, my turn. Never have I ever gone skinny-dipping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Somehow, not even\nsurprised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I ever cheated on\na test.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, lay it on me,&rdquo; you\nchuckle, taking another drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. Never have I ever jumped\nfrom a roof.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sheepishly reaches for the\nbottle, taking a big gulp.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Seriously?</i>&rdquo; You wrinkle your nose at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell me about\nit sometime.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bites the inside of his cheek\nto keep from smiling too hard at the mention of a next time.</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I ever driven\nwhile drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. I have never,&rdquo; you\nraise your hands with a glint in your eyes, &ldquo;and quite frankly I&rsquo;m\ninsulted you&rsquo;d even think you&rsquo;d get me with that.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckles bashfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. Hmm. Never have I ever been given a jacket when I\nwas cold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Are you </i>cold?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kinda?&rdquo;</p><p>He drapes his jacket over you,\nsmiling at you in his cute dopey way at the way the sleeves are far too big and\nyou just kind of sink into it.</p><p>&ldquo;Now you have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sweet.&ldquo;</p><p><i>So are you.</i> Somehow, he has enough self-awareness\nto not voice his thoughts out loud. So, instead, he takes a shot.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he clears his throat,\ncheeks flushing, &ldquo;never have I ever been kissed.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyebrows rise, and it may be\nthe alcohol talking but goddamn you look even more stunning when you lean\nforward and pout in confusion. &ldquo;<i>Never?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;\nHe admits and the smile that follows takes his breath\naway.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Gotta say, I&rsquo;m\nsurprised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrug, taking a gulp. &ldquo;I\njust thought someone as nice as you would have girls throwing themselves at him.&rdquo;\nAnd after a beat, &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re pretty cute, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;\nHe&rsquo;s flushed pink, unsure what to say. Heart hammering\nloud enough for you to hear it. He&rsquo;s sure of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you slowly crawl closer,\nreaching out to place a cool hand onto his cheek and turning his head to face\nyou entirely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing that can&rsquo;t be fixed.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Does she mean-?</i></p><p>His eyes flutter shut when you lean in and kiss him, his hand cupping your jaw in a much too tender way.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Oh, she does.</i> And then all other\nsemi-coherent thoughts leave him and he relaxes, feeling you smile against his\nmouth.</p><p>Your lips make his whole body feel\nwarm, like he is sitting directly next to the sun. Your hand on his jaw feels\ncool though and the contrast is oddly intoxicating.</p><p>Your lips move against his\nsmoothly, expertly, wonderfully. His trying to copy your motions, eager to\nlearn. There&rsquo;s no tongue- there&rsquo;s nothing inherently sexual about the\nsituation- but his heart is pounding, and his stomach is full of\nbutterflies.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s blushing like mad by\nnow and this time it has absolutely nothing to do with embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>And then you&rsquo;re gripping at the\ncollar of his shirt and drawing him closer, dragging your thumb over cheek\nbefore releasing him from your spell and leaning back.</p><p>&ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; you grin,\n&ldquo;now you have.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>The rest of the night goes by in a\nblur, but it&rsquo;s the kiss that lingers on his mind and, quite frankly, his\nlips.&nbsp;</p><p>He still must resist the urge to\ntouch them when he&rsquo;s standing in front of his locker in school, settling for\nbiting his lip instead when they start to tingle at the memory.&nbsp;</p><p>Ned shakes his head, in what he&rsquo;s\nnot sure. Disapproval perhaps? He <i>did </i>tell him after all.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He decides to ask\nfinally, taking a step back and closing his locker.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re head over heels and\nshe&rsquo;s taken. <i>Not\n</i>cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? - I&rsquo;m not-&rdquo; but\nthen he sees you at the other end of the hall and his words die in his throat\nentirely.&nbsp;</p><p>He watches as you kiss your boyfriend,\narms slung around his shoulders, while his hold you snugly by the\nwaist.&nbsp;And when you part, he sees you smiling at him and it makes him look\naway, feeling like he&rsquo;s intruding.&nbsp;</p><p>Ned watches with a sympathetic\nsmile, reaching out to pat him on the back. &ldquo;Told you,&rdquo; he whispers\nsoftly, turning his gaze away from Peter when he hears your heels approaching.</p><p>He gives you a meaningful look and\na small nod before offering Peter another supportive pat and walking off, giving you some privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh.\nHi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you smile and\nreach into your backpack, pulling out his jacket. &ldquo;Here. It&rsquo;s washed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Thank you for giving it\nto me.&rdquo; You inhale softly, biting at your lower lip before dragging your\neyes back to his. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; you begin, sounding so confident and\nuncomfortable at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened yesterday needs\nto stay between us, ok? I was pretty drunk and I- I don&rsquo;t want it getting out.\nYou understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh. Yeah. Of course. Totally.\nI got it. My lips are sealed.&rdquo;</p><p>He makes a motion of zipping his\nlips and throwing away the key. You giggle gently and he&rsquo;d be lying if he\ndidn&rsquo;t feel his heart breaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; you turn to\nwalk away, &ldquo;[Y/N]?&rdquo;</p><p>You turn back to face him, tilting\nyour head in question, and somehow all courage leaves him again and he raises\nhis jacket a little higher and smiles awkwardly. &ldquo;Thanks again. For the\njacket, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo; And\nwith that you turn and disappear in the crowd and Peter has to bite the inside\nof his cheek again.</p><p>This time though to keep from\ncrying.</p><p><i>Foolish boy, to think\nthat something that started with a kiss would end with one.</i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>Tag:&nbsp;</h2><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGXhJXj-elfpExWasSJ6OXA\">@sebastians-stanner</a>, @nottheopera, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> &nbsp;\n\n<br /></p>",

        "body": "<p>Ooooof, been working on this for a bit, but a lil hurt/comfort fic for Norman and secretary, because some angst was a long time coming with the poor bab \ud83d\ude2e\u2764\ufe0f<br/></p><p>Anyway enjoy! \ud83d\ude0a</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cThey\u2019re insane.\u201d Norman kneaded his forehead, before letting go and broadly gesturing in exasperation. \u201cAbsolutely insane!\u201d </p><p>Chloe just about missed his dramatic gesturing by jolting back a bit in her chair, clutching her coffee mug. She set it back down on her coaster and held her chin thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThey sound it.\u201d She reaffirmed, nodding in some confidence. \u201cThat prototype sounds way too big a deal to be done by next week. You sure they won\u2019t let you have more time?\u201d</p><p>Norman scoffed. \u201cOh god no, those pompous pea-brained idiots won\u2019t let me have a single second overtime, not if they can help it.\u201d</p><p>It was Chloe\u2019s turn to gesture in confusion, as she lazily shrugged and squinted her eyes, as though trying to process and make sense of it all. \u201cBut you\u2019ve done so much for them! They really can\u2019t be convinced?\u201d</p><p>Norman shook his head firmly. \u201cNot a chance in hell! They want me to slip up, I just know it. They\u2019ve never liked my own projects, if they could have their way, they\u2019d like me to just screw it all up and to give them an excuse to move on, and find some new team to do their dirty work for them.\u201d Norman continued to gesture as he spoke, impassioned by his rant. It was clear that these were feelings he\u2019d repressed yet recounted to himself for years, and now he had someone to bounce them off of, he was going full throttle with it. </p><p>He let out another scoff as he sat there, collecting his thoughts before he continued. \u201cEven then, they\u2019d just repeat themselves when they got sick of them too.\u201d</p><p>Chloe shook her head disappointed, as she took it all in. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s business.\u201d Norman shrugged and sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for pure innovation and progress.\u201d</p><p>Chloe couldn\u2019t always keep up with his rants, and she couldn\u2019t help but doubt it was just this black and white. But Norman was so frustrated, she\u2019d absolutely let him get everything off his chest.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Norman continued, \u201cI think they know that negotiating isn\u2019t my strong suit anyway. That\u2019s why they think they can get away with it.\u201d</p><p>Chloe raised her brow, surprised by that notion. \u201cAhh what? You\u2019re great with negotiations, I hear you making deals on the phone all the time.\u201d</p><p>With another weak shrug of his shoulders, Norman responded with a tinge of melancholy to his voice, \u201cWith the right people, ones who were going to agree with whatever deal I threw their way anyway. No, when I have to try, I rarely ever get it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I doubt that.\u201d Chloe said, smiling sympathetically at him. She\u2019d not seen Norman speak of himself like this before, but she wanted to try and lift him before he had the chance to get anymore down about himself. But as Norman shot her a sarcastic smirk, she grew worried.</p><p>\u201cYeah well, you\u2019ve been here for what, a few months?\u201d He snapped at her, making Chloe feel a bit sheepish. The feeling subsided quickly however, as Norman\u2019s smarmy look faded and he just looked dejected. He leant back into his chair, with his head down solemnly. \u201cNo, if you were with the company for even a year at least, then you\u2019d see that I fail at negotiations far more than succeed.\u201d</p><p>Chloe didn\u2019t know what to say. She still doubted he was anywhere near as bad as he thought, but that was the thing, even in all these chats and little rants from him, he never showed this side to him, this especially vulnerable side. Before she could respond, Norman continued. \u201cWhat kind of businessman am I really? I can\u2019t even convince some desperate investor to give me just a little more time? I feel like a failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a failure!\u201d Chloe insisted, suddenly growing more firm.</p><p>\u201cI am, Chloe.\u201d Norman didn\u2019t look up to her, he still looked to be relishing in his negative thoughts. Finally, he chuckled weakly and shook his head slowly. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you all of this. You\u2019re my secretary, of course you\u2019d just say anything even a little supportive of me. I\u2019m an idiot for expecting you to care really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d More and more, Chloe\u2019s shy barrier broke apart as she grew more concerned and frustrated. \u201cI care about you, Norman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, you would tell me that though, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Norman barely looked to her, before he returned to just looking down at his lap. It was as if he didn\u2019t even have the energy to lift his head anymore. \u201cI know you\u2019re too polite to let me know how much of an idiot I sound, rambling to you like this.</p><p>Chloe had heard more than enough, she wasn\u2019t going to listen to her friend bad mouth himself anymore. </p><p>\u201cNorman.\u201d As he continued to slump forward, Chloe placed her hand over his and squeezed it gently. The sudden contact made Norman finally look towards her, as she placed her other hand underneath his, and massaged it with her fingers. \u201cYou are NOT an idiot. And especially not for telling me how you feel. You\u2019re one of the smartest, and strongest, and sweetest people I know. And it\u2019s really awful you think that bad of yourself in any way, because you\u2019re such an amazing man, Norman Osborn.\u201d</p><p>As he processed her words, Norman took a few moments before he turned his chair towards her fully. She took his other hand in hers and massaged the both of them. Norman looked down to their hands before returning his gaze to her, still depressed, but quizzical now. </p><p>\u201cYou think all that about me really?\u201d</p><p>Chloe nodded and smiled, still holding his hands. \u201cYes! All that and loads more! And it sounds like you don\u2019t get told that enough.\u201d</p><p>Norman felt his heart swell as he looked to Chloe and listened to her. A part of him still couldn\u2019t believe what she was telling him, but at the same time, he felt he could trust her, that maybe it was all true. \u201cI\u2019ve never been told anything like that. Not for a very long time anyway.\u201d He could feel himself beginning to smile finally. \u201cThank you, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>Chloe shook her curly head and beamed at him. \u201cIt\u2019s more than ok!\u201d</p><p>As much as Norman would have liked to stop there and not give anymore of himself away, he found himself continuing anyway. \u201cI am sorry for snapping at you too. I guess I\u2019ve not gotten much sleep lately either. Things on my mind. My work, my family\u2019s problems, my own &hellip;\u201d </p><p>He sighed and looked down to his desk, trying to avert his eyes. He could feel them beginning to water. \u201cI\u2019m just so tired.\u201d</p><p>His aversion didn\u2019t work at all, as Chloe saw the shine from his eyes. Her heart hurt from seeing her friend so upset, and while she knew what she was about to do was inappropriate, being his employee especially, she just couldn\u2019t help herself, he needed it. She got up from her chair and wrapped her arms around Norman, taking him in for a tight hug.</p><p>Norman nearly felt shocked out of his upset state through that alone, as his body stiffened and his face heated up. He hadn\u2019t had such a big hug in so long, especially not from a woman. Or from an employee, for that matter. But at this moment, it did feel so comforting to have his new friend take him into her embrace. He found himself sinking into the hug and he wrapped an arm around Chloe\u2019s back, rubbing it softly. Neither spoke for a few moments, until Chloe finally broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely get lots of rest tonight, Norman, just try. In the morning you can come back to the problem, all freshened up. And I\u2019ll help, if you\u2019d like!\u201d </p><p>Norman chuckled and pulled back his arm, signalling he was done with the hug. As Chloe let go, he looked to her as she still stood in front of his chair.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot you can do, no offence. Unless you carry a degree, I don\u2019t know about?\u201d Norman\u2019s eyes were still a bit red from a few stray tears, but his cheeky smirk was genuine as he joked. Chloe felt so glad he was looking a bit better, and she played along with a big shrug.</p><p>\u201cI dunno! Unless I carry a degree even <i>I</i> don\u2019t know about!\u201d She mock gasped, as Norman grinned.</p><p>\u201cEven with that imaginary one, you\u2019d have more than all those investors put together.\u201d He chuckled at the jab, it felt cathartic after everything.</p><p>\u201cYeah true!\u201d Chloe laughed before sitting back down again. \u201cBut if I can do anything at all, I will!\u201d She sat up straight and with confidence, to prove her point that she was dependable. It made Norman smile to see this, he wasn\u2019t used to seeing someone at his work be so plucky.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done more than enough for now, Chloe. But thank you. Thank you for the kind words and the &hellip; the hug.\u201d Norman paused as he tried not to blush again, remembering the shock, the warmth and the safety of the cuddle.</p><p>He hardly needed to worry about embarrassing himself however, as Chloe was giggling and blushing herself; shrugging her shoulders and brushing her skirt sheepishly. \u201cThat\u2019s ok. You just looked like you needed one.\u201d</p><p>Norman smiled at the bashful woman, and responded honestly. \u201cI did, I think I really did.\u201d</p>",

She set it back down on her coaster and held her chin thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cThey sound it.\u201d She reaffirmed, nodding in some confidence. \u201cThat prototype sounds way too big a deal to be done by next week. You sure they won\u2019t let you have more time?\u201d</p><p>Norman scoffed. \u201cOh god no, those pompous pea-brained idiots won\u2019t let me have a single second overtime, not if they can help it.\u201d</p><p>It was Chloe\u2019s turn to gesture in confusion, as she lazily shrugged and squinted her eyes, as though trying to process and make sense of it all. \u201cBut you\u2019ve done so much for them! They really can\u2019t be convinced?\u201d</p><p>Norman shook his head firmly. \u201cNot a chance in hell! They want me to slip up, I just know it. They\u2019ve never liked my own projects, if they could have their way, they\u2019d like me to just screw it all up and to give them an excuse to move on, and find some new team to do their dirty work for them.\u201d Norman continued to gesture as he spoke, impassioned by his rant. It was clear that these were feelings he\u2019d repressed yet recounted to himself for years, and now he had someone to bounce them off of, he was going full throttle with it. </p><p>He let out another scoff as he sat there, collecting his thoughts before he continued. \u201cEven then, they\u2019d just repeat themselves when they got sick of them too.\u201d</p><p>Chloe shook her head disappointed, as she took it all in. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s business.\u201d Norman shrugged and sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for pure innovation and progress.\u201d</p><p>Chloe couldn\u2019t always keep up with his rants, and she couldn\u2019t help but doubt it was just this black and white. But Norman was so frustrated, she\u2019d absolutely let him get everything off his chest.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Norman continued, \u201cI think they know that negotiating isn\u2019t my strong suit anyway. That\u2019s why they think they can get away with it.\u201d</p><p>Chloe raised her brow, surprised by that notion. \u201cAhh what? You\u2019re great with negotiations, I hear you making deals on the phone all the time.\u201d</p><p>With another weak shrug of his shoulders, Norman responded with a tinge of melancholy to his voice, \u201cWith the right people, ones who were going to agree with whatever deal I threw their way anyway. No, when I have to try, I rarely ever get it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I doubt that.\u201d Chloe said, smiling sympathetically at him. She\u2019d not seen Norman speak of himself like this before, but she wanted to try and lift him before he had the chance to get anymore down about himself. But as Norman shot her a sarcastic smirk, she grew worried.</p><p>\u201cYeah well, you\u2019ve been here for what, a few months?\u201d He snapped at her, making Chloe feel a bit sheepish. The feeling subsided quickly however, as Norman\u2019s smarmy look faded and he just looked dejected. He leant back into his chair, with his head down solemnly. \u201cNo, if you were with the company for even a year at least, then you\u2019d see that I fail at negotiations far more than succeed.\u201d</p><p>Chloe didn\u2019t know what to say. She still doubted he was anywhere near as bad as he thought, but that was the thing, even in all these chats and little rants from him, he never showed this side to him, this especially vulnerable side. Before she could respond, Norman continued. \u201cWhat kind of businessman am I really? I can\u2019t even convince some desperate investor to give me just a little more time? I feel like a failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a failure!\u201d Chloe insisted, suddenly growing more firm.</p><p>\u201cI am, Chloe.\u201d Norman didn\u2019t look up to her, he still looked to be relishing in his negative thoughts. Finally, he chuckled weakly and shook his head slowly. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you all of this. You\u2019re my secretary, of course you\u2019d just say anything even a little supportive of me. I\u2019m an idiot for expecting you to care really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d More and more, Chloe\u2019s shy barrier broke apart as she grew more concerned and frustrated. \u201cI care about you, Norman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, you would tell me that though, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Norman barely looked to her, before he returned to just looking down at his lap. It was as if he didn\u2019t even have the energy to lift his head anymore. \u201cI know you\u2019re too polite to let me know how much of an idiot I sound, rambling to you like this.</p><p>Chloe had heard more than enough, she wasn\u2019t going to listen to her friend bad mouth himself anymore. </p><p>\u201cNorman.\u201d As he continued to slump forward, Chloe placed her hand over his and squeezed it gently. The sudden contact made Norman finally look towards her, as she placed her other hand underneath his, and massaged it with her fingers. \u201cYou are NOT an idiot. And especially not for telling me how you feel. You\u2019re one of the smartest, and strongest, and sweetest people I know. And it\u2019s really awful you think that bad of yourself in any way, because you\u2019re such an amazing man, Norman Osborn.\u201d</p><p>As he processed her words, Norman took a few moments before he turned his chair towards her fully. She took his other hand in hers and massaged the both of them. Norman looked down to their hands before returning his gaze to her, still depressed, but quizzical now. </p><p>\u201cYou think all that about me really?\u201d</p><p>Chloe nodded and smiled, still holding his hands. \u201cYes! All that and loads more! And it sounds like you don\u2019t get told that enough.\u201d</p><p>Norman felt his heart swell as he looked to Chloe and listened to her. A part of him still couldn\u2019t believe what she was telling him, but at the same time, he felt he could trust her, that maybe it was all true. \u201cI\u2019ve never been told anything like that. Not for a very long time anyway.\u201d He could feel himself beginning to smile finally. \u201cThank you, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>Chloe shook her curly head and beamed at him. \u201cIt\u2019s more than ok!\u201d</p><p>As much as Norman would have liked to stop there and not give anymore of himself away, he found himself continuing anyway. \u201cI am sorry for snapping at you too. I guess I\u2019ve not gotten much sleep lately either. Things on my mind. My work, my family\u2019s problems, my own \u2026\u201d </p><p>He sighed and looked down to his desk, trying to avert his eyes. He could feel them beginning to water. \u201cI\u2019m just so tired.\u201d</p><p>His aversion didn\u2019t work at all, as Chloe saw the shine from his eyes. Her heart hurt from seeing her friend so upset, and while she knew what she was about to do was inappropriate, being his employee especially, she just couldn\u2019t help herself, he needed it. She got up from her chair and wrapped her arms around Norman, taking him in for a tight hug.</p><p>Norman nearly felt shocked out of his upset state through that alone, as his body stiffened and his face heated up. He hadn\u2019t had such a big hug in so long, especially not from a woman. Or from an employee, for that matter. But at this moment, it did feel so comforting to have his new friend take him into her embrace. He found himself sinking into the hug and he wrapped an arm around Chloe\u2019s back, rubbing it softly. Neither spoke for a few moments, until Chloe finally broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely get lots of rest tonight, Norman, just try. In the morning you can come back to the problem, all freshened up. And I\u2019ll help, if you\u2019d like!\u201d </p><p>Norman chuckled and pulled back his arm, signalling he was done with the hug. As Chloe let go, he looked to her as she still stood in front of his chair.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot you can do, no offence. Unless you carry a degree, I don\u2019t know about?\u201d Norman\u2019s eyes were still a bit red from a few stray tears, but his cheeky smirk was genuine as he joked. Chloe felt so glad he was looking a bit better, and she played along with a big shrug.</p><p>\u201cI dunno! Unless I carry a degree even <i>I</i> don\u2019t know about!\u201d She mock gasped, as Norman grinned.</p><p>\u201cEven with that imaginary one, you\u2019d have more than all those investors put together.\u201d He chuckled at the jab, it felt cathartic after everything.</p><p>\u201cYeah true!\u201d Chloe laughed before sitting back down again. \u201cBut if I can do anything at all, I will!\u201d She sat up straight and with confidence, to prove her point that she was dependable. It made Norman smile to see this, he wasn\u2019t used to seeing someone at his work be so plucky.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done more than enough for now, Chloe. But thank you. Thank you for the kind words and the \u2026 the hug.\u201d Norman paused as he tried not to blush again, remembering the shock, the warmth and the safety of the cuddle.</p><p>He hardly needed to worry about embarrassing himself however, as Chloe was giggling and blushing herself; shrugging her shoulders and brushing her skirt sheepishly. \u201cThat\u2019s ok. You just looked like you needed one.\u201d</p><p>Norman smiled at the bashful woman, and responded honestly. \u201cI did, I think I really did.\u201d</p>",
