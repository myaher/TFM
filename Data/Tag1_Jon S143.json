And the bravest.\u201d A shadow crossed the Prince\u2019s face for a moment, then left as suddenly as it had appeared, \u201cWell, save for this lady here, mayhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Lyanna is\u2026fierce,\u201d Ser Arthur admitted. </p><p>Lyanna chuckled at that. \u201cThis arse crowned me,\u201d she pointed across the fire to Prince Rhaegar, \u201cSer Arthur. Did he kill me?\u201d</p><p>Rhaegar and Arthur stared at each other in shock before the Sword or the Morning started chuckling. \u201cDid you just call the Crown Prince an \u2018arse\u2019, my lady?\u201d Ser Arthur\u2019s face was full of mirth. Rhaegar\u2019s was more guarded, his beautiful features giving nothing away, but Lyanna saw the twinkle in his eyes. She smiled brightly at his question, feeling lighter than she had in days. </p><p>\u201cAye, I did, Ser Arthur. I always try and tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>The Knight smiled at her before looking at Prince Rhaegar. \u201cI reckon you\u2019re right, my lady. He can be an arse.\u201d They were all smiling now. Even Prince Rhaegar had one, a small and weak one, but a smile, nonetheless. Lyanna wondered how beautiful he would look with an actual smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite a conundrum, my good Ser. He\u2019s both an arse and a pain in the arse. A rare thing.\u201d</p><p>They all exploded in laughter. Even her moody Prince. </p><p>Finally, he smiled. Truly and brightly. It was one of the more gorgeous things Lyanna had ever seen. The way it reached his eyes, turning his purple eyes into precious gems, thrilled her. She found herself wanting to drown in them, to act a fool for the rest of her life it meant seeing those eyes shining like that.  </p><p>The realization dawned on her amidst the laughter. She loved him. Rhaegar Targaryen. The married Crown Prince of Westeros. She was truly fucked. </p><p>As if he could sense her thoughts, Rhaegar\u2019s laughter died quickly, his broody scowl snapping back into place. He was staring at her, through her it seemed with those eyes, darker now. \u201cPerhaps I have, my lady.\u201d The sadness in his voice wiped the smile off her face, replaced with confusion. </p><p>\u201cKilled you, that is.\u201d</p><p>A stunned silence took hold of her. Ser Arthur had the manners to look away, Dawn on his lap, cleaning it with an oiled rag. Lyanna stared at Rhaegar, tried to see his meaning but she could find none. No sign of mirth was evident. The moment between them stretched on and on. Until Lyanna could take no more and reached next to her, grabbed a big pebble and hurled it at his head. </p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d he said as he reached for the top of his head. He rubbed his hand across it, checking for blood. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, my Prince,\u201d she said with as much scorn as she could muster. \u201cNow I\u2019ve crowned you. Have I killed you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, hand on his head and the smile reappeared. The slight one, stiff and sad. Lyanna though, would take whatever he gave her. She wanted to kiss him, there, on the corner of his mouth, just below the dimple that formed with his smile. </p><p>\u201cValar Morghulis,\u201d he muttered. </p>",

The angst that they have in life makes for more \nconflict, makes for more drama, and there&rsquo;s something very attractive \nabout that.<b> My Game of Thrones is told by outsiders of both types. None \nof them fit comfortably into the society into which they&rsquo;ve been born, \nand they&rsquo;re all struggling to find a place for themselves in which \nthey&rsquo;re valued and loved and respected, despite what their society \nconsiders their deficiencies. </b>And out of that, I think, comes good \nstories.\n\n- GRRM</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/purple-socks#221x6x5\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/purple-socks#221x6x5</a></p><blockquote><p>\nFive central characters will make it through all three volumes, however,\n growing from children to adults and changing the world and themselves \nin the process. <b>In a sense, my trilogy is almost a generational saga, \ntelling the life stories of these five characters, three men and two \nwomen. The five key players are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, \nand three of the children of Winterfell, Arya, Bran, and the bastard Jon\n Snow. </b>All of them are introduced at some length in the chapters you \nhave to hand. <br /></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-original-story-2017-8\">https://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-original-story-2017-8</a></p><p>At the end of day, this series is about the outcasts and underdogs of society rising above society&rsquo;s opinions and views on them and becoming something better and bigger. It is about Jon Snow being a good person despite society thinking that bastards are black hearted and of wanton nature because they are born of lust. It&rsquo;s about Bran saving the world despite being a cripple who can no longer be a knight or fight. It&rsquo;s about Arya being a good leader and possibly finding love and happiness despite not conforming to society&rsquo;s views and expectations on how a proper lady should be. It&rsquo;s about the exiled princess&nbsp; Dany finding a home with the red door and defying society&rsquo;s expectations about how she will be exactly like her father. It&rsquo;s about the deformed imp being a good, tactical strategist and hand and being more capable of managing power than either of his perfectly formed siblings.<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s a generational saga about how these characters prove society was wrong about them and how they rise from being the underdogs to a position of power to save the world. <br /></p><p>GRRM&rsquo;s story is not about Dany proving that Westeros society was right about her and she is going to become exactly like her dad. It&rsquo;s not about how Westeros society was right about Jon and he is indeed deceitful manipulating a woman by seducing her. It&rsquo;s not about how Arya is only good for killing because she is not a proper lady. It&rsquo;s not about how Bran is an emotionless robot useful only for exposition about the past. It&rsquo;s not about Tyrion failing and never getting any love and respect because he is deformed and an imp. <br /></p><p>If that&rsquo;s what GRRM is heading towards and his message is that these characters can never rise above their birth and will prove that the bigoted Westeros society was right about them, then that&rsquo;s ultimately a very nihilistic tale with no moral message and is the complete opposite of Tolkein&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings. <br /></p></p>",
