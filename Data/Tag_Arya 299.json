        "answer": "<p>Oh, Arya, no question in my mind. Per\u00a0\u201cTheon I\u201d TWOW, this was the last we heard about Jeyne Poole:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOh, and take the Stark girl with you. Deliver her to Lord Commander Snow on your way to Eastwatch.\u201d Stannis tapped the parchment that lay before him. \u201cA true king pays his debts.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>But, of course, what neither Stannis nor Justin Massey knew in that moment (since chronologically it hadn\u2019t happened yet) is that Jon Snow <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/161741380138/in-regards-to-the-mutiny-at-castle-black-was\">was assassinated by Bowen Marsh and his fellow co-conspirators</a>, and while he seems all but certain to come back to life in TWOW, for the moment there is no Lord Commander Snow to whom Ser Justin can deliver Jeyne. Justin might have been prepared by Stannis to hear rumors (maybe even true) that his king had fallen in battle against the Boltons, but certainly he would not expect to hear that the Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch was dead as well. Unless he is completely stupid, I think Justin Massey is going to hear about Jon being killed, decide that Castle Black is no place for the woman he believes to be Arya Stark, and take her (and Alysane Mormont!) to Eastwatch directly, and thence to Braavos.</p><p>And that, I think, is where Arya will come in. Much of her FeastDance arc has been questioning whether she can truly become\u00a0\u201cno one\u201d, and emphasizing that Arya cannot let go of her own identity, not entirely. Even into TWOW, Arya is still caught between her training as a Faceless Man and her personal feelings and goals as Arya Stark - and as her killing of Raff showed, Arya is still not willing to completely subsume her motivations into the philosophy of the House of Black and White. The farther she goes in her training, the more difficult those two paths are going to be to reconcile (not to mention the possible punishment-training the Faceless Men will impose on her for killing again out of the line of duty, so to speak).</p><p>The arrival of Jeyne Poole with Justin Massey will be, then, the most explicit, obvious challenge to Arya\u2019s Faceless Men journey of de-identification. Here will be someone not merely that she vaguely recognizes (like Dareon and Sam, whom she knew for Night\u2019s Watchmen), nor someone that she knows personally but is otherwise unremarkable as an individual (like Raff), but someone that she knows personally who is believed to be Arya Stark herself. If she does nothing to intervene with Justin\u2019s party, Arya will have made a firm decision that she wishes to let go of her former life, to give up being Arya Stark \u2026 but of course she can\u2019t. She knows Jeyne too well, is indeed among the few people who could positively identify\u00a0\u201cLady Arya\u201d as the steward of Winterfell\u2019s daughter (and, just as importantly, Jeyne is also uniquely capable of identifying Arya as the real Arya Stark). Confronted with the possibility of losing more of herself (physically and psychologically) to the Faceless Men, given the opportunity to once and for all assert herself as Arya Stark and return home, I think Arya will do just that, finally letting poor Jeyne be Jeyne Poole again and publicly reclaiming her Stark identity.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s not to say Sansa will never see her old friend again, of course. <a href=\"http://goodqueenaly.tumblr.com/post/165259156973/what-do-you-think-about-the-theory-that-sansa-is\">I\u2019m very much convinced that part of Sansa\u2019s turn against Littlefinger will be finding out both that Baelish was behind her father\u2019s fall (and death) <i>and </i>that he sold her closest childhood companion into sexual slavery and eventually had her pretend to be her own sister to marry a monster</a>. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she, Jeyne, and Arya all ended up in ADOS in Winterfell, home after long and often brutal journeys away for all three.</p>",

Obsessed with Jaqen H'ghar and Arya Stark and the House of Black and White ;) I love Braavos above all and I hope Arya and Jaqen story will be much better in the next book than what we've got so far in the show. I also love Tyrion  Lannister (really hope he'll get better lines next season), Jon Snow and ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I ship Arya and Jaqen, Tyrion and Tysha (I believe there is hope for them in the book) , Jaime and Brienne, Sansa and Sandor though I also like the idea of Sansa reuniting with Tyrion. I believe Rhaegar Targaryen never raped  Lyanna Stark but saved her from awful Robert Baratheon.",
