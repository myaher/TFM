        "body": "<p><b><br/></b>Although it was small in comparison to other national phenomenons, the sudden pattern in the cornfield brought hundreds of spectators to the farm to overlook the crop circles. Phil didn\u2019t mind too much, after a while the company of just his animals wasn\u2019t enough to ease his instinctual needs.<b><br/></b></p><p>Before the abnormalities began, it was only him and his livestock, no one else in their little cluster. Everyday he would ride behind the cattle on his quarter horse mare, herding them over the town bridge &ndash; which had a great view of the entirety of his farm &ndash; to the best grasslands. But just last week, on the daily ride home, he could have sworn he saw a silver dome shape gleaming in the light of the sunset, coming from just over the first hill, a small ways beyond the barn. He shook his head and chalked it up to a long day of work, assuring himself that he\u2019d finish the rest of the chores quickly so he could go to sleep early tonight. He put the cows back, remembering to say goodnight to all ten, and went to give Amber her grain, planning to check out the mirage his tired brain conjured up when she\u2019d settled. </p><p>Phil did up the latch on the barn door and started the walk out back. It was a bit of a journey, but he wouldn\u2019t risk riding out there in case Amber got spooked. He certainly didn\u2019t need a broken neck from being thrown. Coming over the crest of the hill, Phil thought he saw a figure dash through an opening in the crops to the left of his peripheral. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d He shouted, cursing himself for not bringing some form of defense. It was probably just some ratty criminal on the run, hiding out in his fields from the law. \u201cI said: who\u2019s there?\u201d Phil called again. He needed to get a good look at their face in case he had to go in to pick them out of a lineup after they were detained. Phil waited for a moment without seeing anything before he turned around to head home, deciding the criminal ran off again. He spun on his heel, jumping three feet in the air as he almost walked right into a man who looked to be just a bit younger than Phil. In the lingering sunlight, Phil found the man had curly brown hair, and gleaming brown eyes that stared right back at him &ndash; not in a creepy way, but with great interest and curiosity. After a few stuttering breaths, Phil calmed down, putting his hand over his heart to assess its pounding rhythm. </p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d he choked out, the man simply staring back at him in silence. As Phil awkwardly studied him in return, he was convinced he saw the man\u2019s brown eyes changing color. They turned from golden brown to a blue gray, then a muted purple &ndash; like the aurora borealis &ndash; \u00a0finally settling on brown once more. Phil\u2019s brain assured himself that it wasn\u2019t possible for eyes to naturally be that color. Time passed, and the man kept staring at Phil, seemingly unblinking. Phil was silently freaking out. He assumed they must be in between a language barrier or else the man surely would have said something by now, so he motioned to himself slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d he enunciated, speaking slowly and trying for a warm tone. He wasn\u2019t sure if the man would respond, so he held his hand out as a peace offering. Phil watched as the man&rsquo;s eyes darted from Phil\u2019s hand to his face and back, panicky, but almost as if they were also searching for something. Phil shrugged and withdrew his hand to rest at his side. He took one final look into the field for any source of explanation as to where the trespasser came from. </p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d He grumbled, withdrawing from the encounter to walk back to his house, hoping the man would run off to wherever he came from and leave him be. The guy really didn\u2019t look like a psychopath. Not that one could necessarily model the part on appearance alone, but that\u2019s beside the point. Phil made it to the backdoor a while later. He hadn\u2019t heard anything else on the way back, so he figured he was in the clear from any more potential disturbances. In the reflection of the door\u2019s window, he almost imagined another figure behind him. He turned around cautiously, and sure enough, the weird guy was there. Except now, his hair looked darker under the light of the back porch, and his skin was glowing. And not like a happy glow. Purple, like his eyes had once been. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Phil stuttered as he was watched expectantly. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d He offered, mentally punching himself. This guy was Cirque-Du-Soleil levels of freaky and Phil just asked him to enter his home. What\u2019s next, tea and family game night? Although he had another puzzled look about him, the man (thing?) gave a jerky head nod and watched Phil again. Phil opened the screen door, waiting for man to go in. When he didn\u2019t enter first, Phill sighed and went in, clumsily holding the door as the man right on his heels. Literally. He had almost no elbow room. This was by far the weirdest and most awkward Phil had ever felt. Closing the door behind them, he attempted to turn around, coming to a stop a mere few inches from the other man\u2019s face. And even though he should probably pull back and apologize, he was convinced that the man\u2019s eyes were changing color &ndash; blue to gray, then purple, with a hint of yellow. Phil was frozen still and studying the man once more, but he jerked back a step when his brain caught up to the anomaly in front of him. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d He asked, even somewhat knowing that he wouldn\u2019t get an answer. The man surprised him once more, though, as he opened his mouth to speak. </p><p>What came out was more of a garbled squawk, though. Phil had to hold back a laugh, knowing it would be rude to make fun of his guest. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we speak the same language,\u201d he began, \u201cbut I caught a bit of a \u2018D\u2019 sound in there so we\u2019ll go off that. How about -\u201d he broke off, looking around his kitchen for something. He spotted an empty can on the counter. \u201cDan?\u201d The man preened at that, a bright pink hue working its way up his freckled neck. There was a softness in his eyes, too. Phil couldn\u2019t stop looking at them, the color changes reminding him of paint washing off a brush, all the shades mixing and bleeding together. Besides his eyes and gleaming skin, Phil noticed Dan was wearing normal clothes, like his &ndash; baggy jeans and a loose cotton tee, but no shoes. His feet were awfully clean for being barefoot in the dirt for however long he must have been wandering around in Phil\u2019s fields. Phil really needed to figure out what was going on. He tried to gesture for Dan to go sit on the couch in the living room, deciding to show him what he meant instead when Dan didn\u2019t move from beside him. Immediately after Phil sat, Dan was next to him again, pressed right up against his side. Desperately, Phil tried to think of what to say, the silence gradually suffocating his brain. </p><p>Before Phil could speak, Dan pulled at his hand from where it rested on his knee. Phil let him, merely a spectator as Dan too his hand and turned it palm up. He kept his own eyes trained on Phil, assessing him for something, but Phil was too distracted to find out what. Dan\u2019s hand was unusually soft, almost silk-like, and as he looked on longer, the skin on his fingertips began to shift into the color of the night sky. Now Phil knew he was losing his mind, no doubt about it. Phil observed as the colors took over Dan\u2019s whole hand, resembling the galaxy enough that Phil could make out little planets and comets. It was astonishing. The galaxy kept growing bigger, traversing up Dan\u2019s arm, and even starting to appear on the other. Phil sensed himself smiling in awe, his unoccupied hand almost reaching out to touch Dan\u2019s, but stopping just before, fearful that he might muck up something so beautiful. </p><p>Sooner than he\u2019d like, the galaxies started to fade back down Dan\u2019s arm and onto his hand, finally ending to rest on his fingertips like polish. Dan smiled oddly at Phil. Phil shook his head, blown away but whatever it was that just happened. He\u2019d never seen anything like Dan, and now, selfishly, he wanted to keep him here and solve the puzzle of this wonderfully alien mystery.</p>",

Purple, like his eyes had once been. </p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Phil stuttered as he was watched expectantly. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d He offered, mentally punching himself. This guy was Cirque-Du-Soleil levels of freaky and Phil just asked him to enter his home. What\u2019s next, tea and family game night? Although he had another puzzled look about him, the man (thing?) gave a jerky head nod and watched Phil again. Phil opened the screen door, waiting for man to go in. When he didn\u2019t enter first, Phill sighed and went in, clumsily holding the door as the man right on his heels. Literally. He had almost no elbow room. This was by far the weirdest and most awkward Phil had ever felt. Closing the door behind them, he attempted to turn around, coming to a stop a mere few inches from the other man\u2019s face. And even though he should probably pull back and apologize, he was convinced that the man\u2019s eyes were changing color \u2013 blue to gray, then purple, with a hint of yellow. Phil was frozen still and studying the man once more, but he jerked back a step when his brain caught up to the anomaly in front of him. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d He asked, even somewhat knowing that he wouldn\u2019t get an answer. The man surprised him once more, though, as he opened his mouth to speak. </p><p>What came out was more of a garbled squawk, though. Phil had to hold back a laugh, knowing it would be rude to make fun of his guest. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we speak the same language,\u201d he began, \u201cbut I caught a bit of a \u2018D\u2019 sound in there so we\u2019ll go off that. How about -\u201d he broke off, looking around his kitchen for something. He spotted an empty can on the counter. \u201cDan?\u201d The man preened at that, a bright pink hue working its way up his freckled neck. There was a softness in his eyes, too. Phil couldn\u2019t stop looking at them, the color changes reminding him of paint washing off a brush, all the shades mixing and bleeding together. Besides his eyes and gleaming skin, Phil noticed Dan was wearing normal clothes, like his \u2013 baggy jeans and a loose cotton tee, but no shoes. His feet were awfully clean for being barefoot in the dirt for however long he must have been wandering around in Phil\u2019s fields. Phil really needed to figure out what was going on. He tried to gesture for Dan to go sit on the couch in the living room, deciding to show him what he meant instead when Dan didn\u2019t move from beside him. Immediately after Phil sat, Dan was next to him again, pressed right up against his side. Desperately, Phil tried to think of what to say, the silence gradually suffocating his brain. </p><p>Before Phil could speak, Dan pulled at his hand from where it rested on his knee. Phil let him, merely a spectator as Dan too his hand and turned it palm up. He kept his own eyes trained on Phil, assessing him for something, but Phil was too distracted to find out what. Dan\u2019s hand was unusually soft, almost silk-like, and as he looked on longer, the skin on his fingertips began to shift into the color of the night sky. Now Phil knew he was losing his mind, no doubt about it. Phil observed as the colors took over Dan\u2019s whole hand, resembling the galaxy enough that Phil could make out little planets and comets. It was astonishing. The galaxy kept growing bigger, traversing up Dan\u2019s arm, and even starting to appear on the other. Phil sensed himself smiling in awe, his unoccupied hand almost reaching out to touch Dan\u2019s, but stopping just before, fearful that he might muck up something so beautiful. </p><p>Sooner than he\u2019d like, the galaxies started to fade back down Dan\u2019s arm and onto his hand, finally ending to rest on his fingertips like polish. Dan smiled oddly at Phil. Phil shook his head, blown away but whatever it was that just happened. He\u2019d never seen anything like Dan, and now, selfishly, he wanted to keep him here and solve the puzzle of this wonderfully alien mystery.</p>",

Phil didn\u2019t mind too much, after a while the company of just his animals wasn\u2019t enough to ease his instinctual needs.<b><br></b></p><p>Before the abnormalities began, it was only him and his livestock, no one else in their little cluster. Everyday he would ride behind the cattle on his quarter horse mare, herding them over the town bridge \u2013 which had a great view of the entirety of his farm \u2013 to the best grasslands. But just last week, on the daily ride home, he could have sworn he saw a silver dome shape gleaming in the light of the sunset, coming from just over the first hill, a small ways beyond the barn. He shook his head and chalked it up to a long day of work, assuring himself that he\u2019d finish the rest of the chores quickly so he could go to sleep early tonight. He put the cows back, remembering to say goodnight to all ten, and went to give Amber her grain, planning to check out the mirage his tired brain conjured up when she\u2019d settled. </p><p>Phil did up the latch on the barn door and started the walk out back. It was a bit of a journey, but he wouldn\u2019t risk riding out there in case Amber got spooked. He certainly didn\u2019t need a broken neck from being thrown. Coming over the crest of the hill, Phil thought he saw a figure dash through an opening in the crops to the left of his peripheral. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d He shouted, cursing himself for not bringing some form of defense. It was probably just some ratty criminal on the run, hiding out in his fields from the law. \u201cI said: who\u2019s there?\u201d Phil called again. He needed to get a good look at their face in case he had to go in to pick them out of a lineup after they were detained. Phil waited for a moment without seeing anything before he turned around to head home, deciding the criminal ran off again. He spun on his heel, jumping three feet in the air as he almost walked right into a man who looked to be just a bit younger than Phil. In the lingering sunlight, Phil found the man had curly brown hair, and gleaming brown eyes that stared right back at him \u2013 not in a creepy way, but with great interest and curiosity. After a few stuttering breaths, Phil calmed down, putting his hand over his heart to assess its pounding rhythm. </p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d he choked out, the man simply staring back at him in silence. As Phil awkwardly studied him in return, he was convinced he saw the man\u2019s brown eyes changing color. They turned from golden brown to a blue gray, then a muted purple \u2013 like the aurora borealis \u2013 \u00a0finally settling on brown once more. Phil\u2019s brain assured himself that it wasn\u2019t possible for eyes to naturally be that color. Time passed, and the man kept staring at Phil, seemingly unblinking. Phil was silently freaking out. He assumed they must be in between a language barrier or else the man surely would have said something by now, so he motioned to himself slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d he enunciated, speaking slowly and trying for a warm tone. He wasn\u2019t sure if the man would respond, so he held his hand out as a peace offering. Phil watched as the man\u2019s eyes darted from Phil\u2019s hand to his face and back, panicky, but almost as if they were also searching for something. Phil shrugged and withdrew his hand to rest at his side. He took one final look into the field for any source of explanation as to where the trespasser came from. </p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d He grumbled, withdrawing from the encounter to walk back to his house, hoping the man would run off to wherever he came from and leave him be. The guy really didn\u2019t look like a psychopath. Not that one could necessarily model the part on appearance alone, but that\u2019s beside the point. Phil made it to the backdoor a while later. He hadn\u2019t heard anything else on the way back, so he figured he was in the clear from any more potential disturbances. In the reflection of the door\u2019s window, he almost imagined another figure behind him. He turned around cautiously, and sure enough, the weird guy was there.

Phil just finished reading a chaptered phanfic where Dan dies in the end. He decides to convince Dan to stay one more night, but how?</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14722650\">(ao3 link)</a></p><p><i>pls be nice\n\n\u2661 this\u00a0is the first fic \n\ni\u2019ve written. still very proud of how\u00a0it turned out tho :D</i></p><!-- more --><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>An hour and a half has passed since both Dan and Phil finished eating their dinner which was the usual, Chinese takeaway. Dan is in the office editing a new danandphilgames video while Phil is in the bedroom, just as occupied\u2026</p><p>45th chapter of a 45 chaptered phanfic.</p><p>Phil was curled up facing the right side of the bed. He was hugging his pillow in his left hand and he scrolled through his phone using his right. Only when he inhaled deeply was when he realized his eyes were already filled with tears and was only a matter of time until they actually start flowing.</p><p>The boy sat up and repositioned himself so his back was properly leaning on his pillows and that his glasses won\u2019t be even more bent than it already is.</p><p>He scrolls down once more and reads the last sentence.</p><p><b>\u201cThis was the most fun I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Dan said and took his last breath</b></p><p>That was it.</p><p>Tears were falling already before he could even begin to digest anything properly, and they were falling fast.</p><p>Phil wiped the falling tears using his wrists messily, like a child who dropped his ice cream in public. He laughed and silently cursed himself, finding the irony in this situation. He already knew he was going to regret reading something like this. Especially when he saw the \u2018 angst\u2019 and the \u2018 major character death\u2019 tag. Yet here he is.</p><p>He lay flat on his back like that for a while. Just enough time until his tears stopped flowing but his eyes were still puffed from all the crying.</p><p>Phil breathed deeply then quickly got up. He suddenly just remembered Dan was supposed to be leaving tomorrow morning but anxiety interfered so he just wanted to reassure himself that Dan is here with him, safe and most especially, alive .</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>Dan stretched, shifting on the office chair as he felt all his muscles were strained from maintaining a single position ever since he sat.</p><p>Completely disregarding the consequences this would do to his already poor spine, he slouched even more onto his seat until the only thing keeping him on the chair is mostly his back, and his bum is barely even on the cushion anymore.</p><p>He can see a person\u2019s figure enter the room from his peripheral vision, which he obviously presumed was Phil. But he decided there was no need for him to divert his attention to Phil\u2019s presence so he carried on.</p><p>It took about a full minute or two until Dan can\u2019t help but be bothered still seeing Phil out of the corner of his eye. Furrowing his brows in confusion, he turned to Phil and raised them in question.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;what?\u201d</p><p>The question shook Phil out of his thoughts, Dan could tell.</p><p>His eyes fluttered as he looked everywhere but to Dan\u2019s, then they\u2019ve finally settled on the floor.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem like Phil was going to respond on any second at that moment, so the younger boy spoke again.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>Doe-like blue eyes finally looked up to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cThis is literally what your parents must\u2019ve felt with you running to them and not saying anything in the middle of the night.\u201d Dan said as a sign of reassurance and comfort, trying to ease whatever tension Phil seems to be in.</p><p>Phil gave a really small smile, barely even there unless you look really hard. And of course for Dan, it was.</p><p>Dan glanced at the video he was editing then at Phil. He sat up and turned his chair to face him entirely.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. This is nothing. I was just\u2026 checking if you needed help with the video. You know, give some advice and all that.\u201d Phil was fiddling with his hands. He had an awkward smile and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Dan spun on his chair to save the progress he\u2019s made so far on the computer. He was already getting bored anyway, he was just about to stop.</p><p>\u201cNo! Dan, really. I was just about to go away now. Sorry&hellip; If I&hellip; uh&hellip; creeped you out.\u201d Phil said, his voice getting softer as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I know something\u2019s up. You really think I\u2019d buy that?\u201d Dan replied as he finished shutting down the computer. He stood up and walked towards Phil, stopping right in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you started packing?\u201d Phil said in almost a whisper, looking at Dan.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t expecting Phil to check up on his preparations for his flight tomorrow morning so he choked a chuckle \u201cuh heh.. No. I\u2019ve been editing this video. I haven\u2019t really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to go tomorrow ?\u201d Phil said sitting down on the nearest seat, which was the sofa\u2019s arm.</p><p>Dan smiled. He knows something\u2019s bothering this man, although he can\u2019t help but swoon over clingy Phil. \u201cDo you want me not to?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Phil would normally blush and then shove him whenever Dan would playfully tease him like this but this time, he looked straight into Dan\u2019s eyes and said \u201cNo. I want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Another unexpected response from Phil. Dan was now truly at loss for words, he was stumped at how direct Phil suddenly was.</p><p>It was Phil\u2019s turn to walk towards Dan to stop right in front of him. He didn\u2019t say anything though, he just stared at Dan with hopeful eyes that were also begging, like a puppy waiting for a treat.</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>\u201cI still deserve to know what made you want me to adjust my plans for tomorrow, you know.\u201d Dan said, head resting on Phil\u2019s shoulder with his arm around the younger\u2019s frame. They were both in their pyjamas, having a Netflix marathon on their couch.</p><p>Phil hummed, fingers finding their way to play with Dan\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u201cPhil&hellip;\u201d Dan looked up. Their faces just inches apart as he catches Phil already staring back at him.</p><p>Phil pecked his nose and squeezed him tighter. Dan rolled his eyes and smiled fondly, trying to release himself from Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t just keep avoiding the question, Lester.\u201d holding Phil\u2019s arm to keep it stable, he was now sitting up. Face leaning towards Phil emphasizing his demand for an answer.</p><p>Phil smiled back but a sheepish one. It would seem Dan had figured out he\u2019d been stalling from explaining himself.</p><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Phil paused, embarrassment kicking in. \u201cI&hellip; read a phanfic.\u201d he folded his lips, anxious for Dan\u2019s reaction.</p><p>It was quiet for a while until Dan spoke \u201cYeah? I was waiting for you to continue, sorry.\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Phil frowned and gave Dan a look.</p><p>\u201cBut okay, right. You can\u2019t stop there, that doesn\u2019t really explain anything!\u201d Dan laughed, confused.</p><p>Before Phil could reply, Dan went on \u201cI mean, unless it\u2019s what I think you\u2019re trying to say\u2026 Suggesting to recreate some late night smut content-\u201d</p><p>\u201c Stop .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt explains why you\u2019re suddenly so clingy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, you didn\u2019t have to make me delay my flight for that-\u201d Dan whined, jokingly. He placed his hand on Phil\u2019s cheek as if to indicate comfort.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. \u201d Phil rolled his eyes and shoved Dan, the latter\u2019s laugh echoing in the room.</p><p>\u201cAll we need is a night, you know.\u201d Dan winked and laughed again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me regret stopping you now.\u201d which was true up until he heard Dan\u2019s loud and iconic booming laugh, he knows he\u2019ll never get tired of.</p><p>Dan took Phil\u2019s chin and kissed his cheek. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll stop.\u201d he rested his head on his hand and stared at Phil, smiling. Waiting for him to continue his point.</p><p>Phil poked the tip of Dan\u2019s nose \u201cBesides, if that was my plan&hellip; I wouldn\u2019t bother telling you.\u201d</p><p>Taken by surprise, Dan jerked his chin inwards, but he had a suggestive look on his face as he raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo I even want to know what that meant?\u201d to which, Phil just shrugged. Trying to display innocence whilst having a cheeky expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cJust a disclaimer though, I knew reading this particular phanfic was a bad idea. Since it was tagged with things like angst, drama and explicit -\u201d Phil began.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it then?\u201d Dan cut in.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to keep myself busy, I don\u2019t know! You were leaving so I was looking for things to distract myself from thinking about being alone&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Dan felt his expression go soft as he smiled fondly at Phil.</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be so immersed in the story that I\u2019d finish 45 chapters within 2 days-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah ok, wait a minute&hellip; 45 CHAPTERS WITHIN 2 DAYS?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled, making his tongue poke out. He didn\u2019t really think about the weight of that until Dan pointed it out.</p><p>The entire time Phil was narrating the summary of the phanfic, Dan was constantly disagreeing. Particularly with his character and how he reacted in the story.</p><p>\u201cIs this really how people see me?\u201d or \u201cI would NOT say that. What the hell&hellip;\u201d Dan would say and Phil would just shush him.</p><p>After some time, the story finally came to an end. \u201cThose were your last words. Then you\u2026 died.\u201d Phil breathed as if saying the last word was forbidden, his brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck, that\u2019s brutal.\u201d Dan said as he massaged his forehead with one hand, leaning back to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cExactly why I couldn\u2019t really say anything when I went to you after just finishing it.\u201d</p><p>Dan huffed. \u201cI mean, for the record, I wouldn\u2019t do OR say a lot of those things that caused shit to happen in the first place&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Everything just suddenly went back to Phil. It\u2019s different just hearing someone\u2019s summary than actually reading a phanfic or any story, generally. He didn\u2019t notice he was just staring blankly into space, lost in his thoughts and feelings, again .</p><p>Dan shifted closer to Phil, keeping him from mentally floating away. Using his most soothing voice, he spoke \u201cHey.\u201d taking Phil\u2019s hand gently and rubbing circles on his knuckles with his thumb. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Phil had the saddest eyes Dan had seen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m being weird and selfish\u2026 I made you cancel your flight just so you can be with me unnecessarily being dramatic over a phanfic-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever invalidate your feelings. Whether it\u2019d be something as small as just reading a 45 chaptered harrowing phanfic, you\u2019re allowed to be dramatic about it if you choose to. ESPECIALLY, if it has personally affected you. Don\u2019t apologize because I didn\u2019t really cancel my trip, I rescheduled it. And it\u2019s not like you forced me, I stayed because I\u2019ll always choose you.\u201d</p><p>Phil turned to face him entirely. Hand cupping Dan\u2019s left jaw, he kissed the boy\u2019s lips. Dan kissed back while holding Phil\u2019s hand on his face. The latter was pouring his previous worries and now overwhelming gratitude into the kiss, Dan was reciprocating just as much emotion but with more reassurance and comfort.</p><p>Dan pulled back slowly, leaving only a really thin space between them. \u201cBesides, you being selfish with me is something I don\u2019t mind being the cause of my extended stay here.\u201d</p><p>Softly stealing a kiss from Dan again, Phil said \u201cOf course you would know not to stop me from being dramatic, you spend almost an entire day recovering from something that made you emotional.\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\u201cUhm.. Ok, why you rude?\u201d Dan leaned back and placed his hand on his chest, fingers spread.</p><p>Phil just giggled with the usual tongue-bite-thing\u2122 and tackled Dan onto the sofa.</p><p>Old habits die hard.</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>They were now next to each other on the bed, lights out. Phil\u2019s arm wrapped around Dan\u2019s waist as both of them faced one side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you tell me I spend the entire day being emotional. It took you until 2am to move on&hellip;\u201d Dan mumbled.</p><p>Phil chuckled sleepily and snuggled into the crook of Dan\u2019s neck. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t let that go?\u201d</p><p>The breath on his sensitive neck made Dan shiver. \u201cShut up. I\u2019ll never forgive-\u201d</p><p>Phil noticed the reaction so he bit Dan\u2019s neck which made the younger boy jerk his head up and glared at the giggling black-haired man behind him.</p><p>\u201cPHIL!\u201d</p><p>He was full-on laughing, covering his mouth. \u201cShhh Dan!\u201d Phil said in between giggles. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep, come on.\u201d</p><p>The brunette\u2019s mouth fell open as he furrowed his brows, Dan\u2019s face spelled out you\u2019re unbelievable .</p><p>When Phil\u2019s laugh died down he suddenly felt the room was too quiet. Even though it was what\u2019s supposed to be, especially at this hour. He thought about how empty the bed would feel with just him tomorrow since his roommate&rsquo;s previous morning flight will most likely just turn into an evening one. He still wasn\u2019t sure about the final plans but considering Dan\u2019s presence could be a priority in that event, it might be urgent.

Dan is in the office editing a new danandphilgames video while Phil is in the bedroom, just as occupied\u2026</p><p>45th chapter of a 45 chaptered phanfic.</p><p>Phil was curled up facing the right side of the bed. He was hugging his pillow in his left hand and he scrolled through his phone using his right. Only when he inhaled deeply was when he realized his eyes were already filled with tears and was only a matter of time until they actually start flowing.</p><p>The boy sat up and repositioned himself so his back was properly leaning on his pillows and that his glasses won\u2019t be even more bent than it already is.</p><p>He scrolls down once more and reads the last sentence.</p><p><b>\u201cThis was the most fun I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Dan said and took his last breath</b></p><p>That was it.</p><p>Tears were falling already before he could even begin to digest anything properly, and they were falling fast.</p><p>Phil wiped the falling tears using his wrists messily, like a child who dropped his ice cream in public. He laughed and silently cursed himself, finding the irony in this situation. He already knew he was going to regret reading something like this. Especially when he saw the \u2018 angst\u2019 and the \u2018 major character death\u2019 tag. Yet here he is.</p><p>He lay flat on his back like that for a while. Just enough time until his tears stopped flowing but his eyes were still puffed from all the crying.</p><p>Phil breathed deeply then quickly got up. He suddenly just remembered Dan was supposed to be leaving tomorrow morning but anxiety interfered so he just wanted to reassure himself that Dan is here with him, safe and most especially, alive .</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>Dan stretched, shifting on the office chair as he felt all his muscles were strained from maintaining a single position ever since he sat.</p><p>Completely disregarding the consequences this would do to his already poor spine, he slouched even more onto his seat until the only thing keeping him on the chair is mostly his back, and his bum is barely even on the cushion anymore.</p><p>He can see a person\u2019s figure enter the room from his peripheral vision, which he obviously presumed was Phil. But he decided there was no need for him to divert his attention to Phil\u2019s presence so he carried on.</p><p>It took about a full minute or two until Dan can\u2019t help but be bothered still seeing Phil out of the corner of his eye. Furrowing his brows in confusion, he turned to Phil and raised them in question.</p><p>\u201c\u2026what?\u201d</p><p>The question shook Phil out of his thoughts, Dan could tell.</p><p>His eyes fluttered as he looked everywhere but to Dan\u2019s, then they\u2019ve finally settled on the floor.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem like Phil was going to respond on any second at that moment, so the younger boy spoke again.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>Doe-like blue eyes finally looked up to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cThis is literally what your parents must\u2019ve felt with you running to them and not saying anything in the middle of the night.\u201d Dan said as a sign of reassurance and comfort, trying to ease whatever tension Phil seems to be in.</p><p>Phil gave a really small smile, barely even there unless you look really hard. And of course for Dan, it was.</p><p>Dan glanced at the video he was editing then at Phil. He sat up and turned his chair to face him entirely.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. This is nothing. I was just\u2026 checking if you needed help with the video. You know, give some advice and all that.\u201d Phil was fiddling with his hands. He had an awkward smile and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Dan spun on his chair to save the progress he\u2019s made so far on the computer. He was already getting bored anyway, he was just about to stop.</p><p>\u201cNo! Dan, really. I was just about to go away now. Sorry\u2026 If I\u2026 uh\u2026 creeped you out.\u201d Phil said, his voice getting softer as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I know something\u2019s up. You really think I\u2019d buy that?\u201d Dan replied as he finished shutting down the computer. He stood up and walked towards Phil, stopping right in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you started packing?\u201d Phil said in almost a whisper, looking at Dan.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t expecting Phil to check up on his preparations for his flight tomorrow morning so he choked a chuckle \u201cuh heh.. No. I\u2019ve been editing this video. I haven\u2019t really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to go tomorrow ?\u201d Phil said sitting down on the nearest seat, which was the sofa\u2019s arm.</p><p>Dan smiled. He knows something\u2019s bothering this man, although he can\u2019t help but swoon over clingy Phil. \u201cDo you want me not to?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Phil would normally blush and then shove him whenever Dan would playfully tease him like this but this time, he looked straight into Dan\u2019s eyes and said \u201cNo. I want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Another unexpected response from Phil. Dan was now truly at loss for words, he was stumped at how direct Phil suddenly was.</p><p>It was Phil\u2019s turn to walk towards Dan to stop right in front of him. He didn\u2019t say anything though, he just stared at Dan with hopeful eyes that were also begging, like a puppy waiting for a treat.</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>\u201cI still deserve to know what made you want me to adjust my plans for tomorrow, you know.\u201d Dan said, head resting on Phil\u2019s shoulder with his arm around the younger\u2019s frame. They were both in their pyjamas, having a Netflix marathon on their couch.</p><p>Phil hummed, fingers finding their way to play with Dan\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u2026\u201d Dan looked up. Their faces just inches apart as he catches Phil already staring back at him.</p><p>Phil pecked his nose and squeezed him tighter. Dan rolled his eyes and smiled fondly, trying to release himself from Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t just keep avoiding the question, Lester.\u201d holding Phil\u2019s arm to keep it stable, he was now sitting up. Face leaning towards Phil emphasizing his demand for an answer.</p><p>Phil smiled back but a sheepish one. It would seem Dan had figured out he\u2019d been stalling from explaining himself.</p><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Phil paused, embarrassment kicking in. \u201cI\u2026 read a phanfic.\u201d he folded his lips, anxious for Dan\u2019s reaction.</p><p>It was quiet for a while until Dan spoke \u201cYeah? I was waiting for you to continue, sorry.\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Phil frowned and gave Dan a look.</p><p>\u201cBut okay, right. You can\u2019t stop there, that doesn\u2019t really explain anything!\u201d Dan laughed, confused.</p><p>Before Phil could reply, Dan went on \u201cI mean, unless it\u2019s what I think you\u2019re trying to say\u2026 Suggesting to recreate some late night smut content-\u201d</p><p>\u201c Stop .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt explains why you\u2019re suddenly so clingy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, you didn\u2019t have to make me delay my flight for that-\u201d Dan whined, jokingly. He placed his hand on Phil\u2019s cheek as if to indicate comfort.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. \u201d Phil rolled his eyes and shoved Dan, the latter\u2019s laugh echoing in the room.</p><p>\u201cAll we need is a night, you know.\u201d Dan winked and laughed again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me regret stopping you now.\u201d which was true up until he heard Dan\u2019s loud and iconic booming laugh, he knows he\u2019ll never get tired of.</p><p>Dan took Phil\u2019s chin and kissed his cheek. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll stop.\u201d he rested his head on his hand and stared at Phil, smiling. Waiting for him to continue his point.</p><p>Phil poked the tip of Dan\u2019s nose \u201cBesides, if that was my plan\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t bother telling you.\u201d</p><p>Taken by surprise, Dan jerked his chin inwards, but he had a suggestive look on his face as he raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo I even want to know what that meant?\u201d to which, Phil just shrugged. Trying to display innocence whilst having a cheeky expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cJust a disclaimer though, I knew reading this particular phanfic was a bad idea. Since it was tagged with things like angst, drama and explicit -\u201d Phil began.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it then?\u201d Dan cut in.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to keep myself busy, I don\u2019t know! You were leaving so I was looking for things to distract myself from thinking about being alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan felt his expression go soft as he smiled fondly at Phil.</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be so immersed in the story that I\u2019d finish 45 chapters within 2 days-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah ok, wait a minute\u2026 45 CHAPTERS WITHIN 2 DAYS?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled, making his tongue poke out. He didn\u2019t really think about the weight of that until Dan pointed it out.</p><p>The entire time Phil was narrating the summary of the phanfic, Dan was constantly disagreeing. Particularly with his character and how he reacted in the story.</p><p>\u201cIs this really how people see me?\u201d or \u201cI would NOT say that. What the hell\u2026\u201d Dan would say and Phil would just shush him.</p><p>After some time, the story finally came to an end. \u201cThose were your last words. Then you\u2026 died.\u201d Phil breathed as if saying the last word was forbidden, his brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck, that\u2019s brutal.\u201d Dan said as he massaged his forehead with one hand, leaning back to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cExactly why I couldn\u2019t really say anything when I went to you after just finishing it.\u201d</p><p>Dan huffed. \u201cI mean, for the record, I wouldn\u2019t do OR say a lot of those things that caused shit to happen in the first place\u2026\u201d</p><p>Everything just suddenly went back to Phil. It\u2019s different just hearing someone\u2019s summary than actually reading a phanfic or any story, generally. He didn\u2019t notice he was just staring blankly into space, lost in his thoughts and feelings, again .</p><p>Dan shifted closer to Phil, keeping him from mentally floating away. Using his most soothing voice, he spoke \u201cHey.\u201d taking Phil\u2019s hand gently and rubbing circles on his knuckles with his thumb. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Phil had the saddest eyes Dan had seen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m being weird and selfish\u2026 I made you cancel your flight just so you can be with me unnecessarily being dramatic over a phanfic-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever invalidate your feelings. Whether it\u2019d be something as small as just reading a 45 chaptered harrowing phanfic, you\u2019re allowed to be dramatic about it if you choose to. ESPECIALLY, if it has personally affected you. Don\u2019t apologize because I didn\u2019t really cancel my trip, I rescheduled it. And it\u2019s not like you forced me, I stayed because I\u2019ll always choose you.\u201d</p><p>Phil turned to face him entirely. Hand cupping Dan\u2019s left jaw, he kissed the boy\u2019s lips. Dan kissed back while holding Phil\u2019s hand on his face. The latter was pouring his previous worries and now overwhelming gratitude into the kiss, Dan was reciprocating just as much emotion but with more reassurance and comfort.</p><p>Dan pulled back slowly, leaving only a really thin space between them. \u201cBesides, you being selfish with me is something I don\u2019t mind being the cause of my extended stay here.\u201d</p><p>Softly stealing a kiss from Dan again, Phil said \u201cOf course you would know not to stop me from being dramatic, you spend almost an entire day recovering from something that made you emotional.\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\u201cUhm.. Ok, why you rude?\u201d Dan leaned back and placed his hand on his chest, fingers spread.</p><p>Phil just giggled with the usual tongue-bite-thing\u2122 and tackled Dan onto the sofa.</p><p>Old habits die hard.</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>They were now next to each other on the bed, lights out. Phil\u2019s arm wrapped around Dan\u2019s waist as both of them faced one side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you tell me I spend the entire day being emotional. It took you until 2am to move on\u2026\u201d Dan mumbled.</p><p>Phil chuckled sleepily and snuggled into the crook of Dan\u2019s neck. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t let that go?\u201d</p><p>The breath on his sensitive neck made Dan shiver. \u201cShut up. I\u2019ll never forgive-\u201d</p><p>Phil noticed the reaction so he bit Dan\u2019s neck which made the younger boy jerk his head up and glared at the giggling black-haired man behind him.</p><p>\u201cPHIL!\u201d</p><p>He was full-on laughing, covering his mouth. \u201cShhh Dan!\u201d Phil said in between giggles. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep, come on.\u201d</p><p>The brunette\u2019s mouth fell open as he furrowed his brows, Dan\u2019s face spelled out you\u2019re unbelievable .</p><p>When Phil\u2019s laugh died down he suddenly felt the room was too quiet.

Furrowing his brows in confusion, he turned to Phil and raised them in question.</p><p>\u201c\u2026what?\u201d</p><p>The question shook Phil out of his thoughts, Dan could tell.</p><p>His eyes fluttered as he looked everywhere but to Dan\u2019s, then they\u2019ve finally settled on the floor.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem like Phil was going to respond on any second at that moment, so the younger boy spoke again.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>Doe-like blue eyes finally looked up to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cThis is literally what your parents must\u2019ve felt with you running to them and not saying anything in the middle of the night.\u201d Dan said as a sign of reassurance and comfort, trying to ease whatever tension Phil seems to be in.</p><p>Phil gave a really small smile, barely even there unless you look really hard. And of course for Dan, it was.</p><p>Dan glanced at the video he was editing then at Phil. He sat up and turned his chair to face him entirely.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dan asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. This is nothing. I was just\u2026 checking if you needed help with the video. You know, give some advice and all that.\u201d Phil was fiddling with his hands. He had an awkward smile and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Dan spun on his chair to save the progress he\u2019s made so far on the computer. He was already getting bored anyway, he was just about to stop.</p><p>\u201cNo! Dan, really. I was just about to go away now. Sorry\u2026 If I\u2026 uh\u2026 creeped you out.\u201d Phil said, his voice getting softer as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I know something\u2019s up. You really think I\u2019d buy that?\u201d Dan replied as he finished shutting down the computer. He stood up and walked towards Phil, stopping right in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you started packing?\u201d Phil said in almost a whisper, looking at Dan.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t expecting Phil to check up on his preparations for his flight tomorrow morning so he choked a chuckle \u201cuh heh.. No. I\u2019ve been editing this video. I haven\u2019t really-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to go tomorrow ?\u201d Phil said sitting down on the nearest seat, which was the sofa\u2019s arm.</p><p>Dan smiled. He knows something\u2019s bothering this man, although he can\u2019t help but swoon over clingy Phil. \u201cDo you want me not to?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Phil would normally blush and then shove him whenever Dan would playfully tease him like this but this time, he looked straight into Dan\u2019s eyes and said \u201cNo. I want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Another unexpected response from Phil. Dan was now truly at loss for words, he was stumped at how direct Phil suddenly was.</p><p>It was Phil\u2019s turn to walk towards Dan to stop right in front of him. He didn\u2019t say anything though, he just stared at Dan with hopeful eyes that were also begging, like a puppy waiting for a treat.</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>\u201cI still deserve to know what made you want me to adjust my plans for tomorrow, you know.\u201d Dan said, head resting on Phil\u2019s shoulder with his arm around the younger\u2019s frame. They were both in their pyjamas, having a Netflix marathon on their couch.</p><p>Phil hummed, fingers finding their way to play with Dan\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u201cPhil\u2026\u201d Dan looked up. Their faces just inches apart as he catches Phil already staring back at him.</p><p>Phil pecked his nose and squeezed him tighter. Dan rolled his eyes and smiled fondly, trying to release himself from Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t just keep avoiding the question, Lester.\u201d holding Phil\u2019s arm to keep it stable, he was now sitting up. Face leaning towards Phil emphasizing his demand for an answer.</p><p>Phil smiled back but a sheepish one. It would seem Dan had figured out he\u2019d been stalling from explaining himself.</p><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Phil paused, embarrassment kicking in. \u201cI\u2026 read a phanfic.\u201d he folded his lips, anxious for Dan\u2019s reaction.</p><p>It was quiet for a while until Dan spoke \u201cYeah? I was waiting for you to continue, sorry.\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Phil frowned and gave Dan a look.</p><p>\u201cBut okay, right. You can\u2019t stop there, that doesn\u2019t really explain anything!\u201d Dan laughed, confused.</p><p>Before Phil could reply, Dan went on \u201cI mean, unless it\u2019s what I think you\u2019re trying to say\u2026 Suggesting to recreate some late night smut content-\u201d</p><p>\u201c Stop .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt explains why you\u2019re suddenly so clingy-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, you didn\u2019t have to make me delay my flight for that-\u201d Dan whined, jokingly. He placed his hand on Phil\u2019s cheek as if to indicate comfort.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. \u201d Phil rolled his eyes and shoved Dan, the latter\u2019s laugh echoing in the room.</p><p>\u201cAll we need is a night, you know.\u201d Dan winked and laughed again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me regret stopping you now.\u201d which was true up until he heard Dan\u2019s loud and iconic booming laugh, he knows he\u2019ll never get tired of.</p><p>Dan took Phil\u2019s chin and kissed his cheek. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll stop.\u201d he rested his head on his hand and stared at Phil, smiling. Waiting for him to continue his point.</p><p>Phil poked the tip of Dan\u2019s nose \u201cBesides, if that was my plan\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t bother telling you.\u201d</p><p>Taken by surprise, Dan jerked his chin inwards, but he had a suggestive look on his face as he raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo I even want to know what that meant?\u201d to which, Phil just shrugged. Trying to display innocence whilst having a cheeky expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cJust a disclaimer though, I knew reading this particular phanfic was a bad idea. Since it was tagged with things like angst, drama and explicit -\u201d Phil began.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it then?\u201d Dan cut in.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to keep myself busy, I don\u2019t know! You were leaving so I was looking for things to distract myself from thinking about being alone\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan felt his expression go soft as he smiled fondly at Phil.</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be so immersed in the story that I\u2019d finish 45 chapters within 2 days-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoah ok, wait a minute\u2026 45 CHAPTERS WITHIN 2 DAYS?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled, making his tongue poke out. He didn\u2019t really think about the weight of that until Dan pointed it out.</p><p>The entire time Phil was narrating the summary of the phanfic, Dan was constantly disagreeing. Particularly with his character and how he reacted in the story.</p><p>\u201cIs this really how people see me?\u201d or \u201cI would NOT say that. What the hell\u2026\u201d Dan would say and Phil would just shush him.</p><p>After some time, the story finally came to an end. \u201cThose were your last words. Then you\u2026 died.\u201d Phil breathed as if saying the last word was forbidden, his brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck, that\u2019s brutal.\u201d Dan said as he massaged his forehead with one hand, leaning back to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cExactly why I couldn\u2019t really say anything when I went to you after just finishing it.\u201d</p><p>Dan huffed. \u201cI mean, for the record, I wouldn\u2019t do OR say a lot of those things that caused shit to happen in the first place\u2026\u201d</p><p>Everything just suddenly went back to Phil. It\u2019s different just hearing someone\u2019s summary than actually reading a phanfic or any story, generally. He didn\u2019t notice he was just staring blankly into space, lost in his thoughts and feelings, again .</p><p>Dan shifted closer to Phil, keeping him from mentally floating away. Using his most soothing voice, he spoke \u201cHey.\u201d taking Phil\u2019s hand gently and rubbing circles on his knuckles with his thumb. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Phil had the saddest eyes Dan had seen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m being weird and selfish\u2026 I made you cancel your flight just so you can be with me unnecessarily being dramatic over a phanfic-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever invalidate your feelings. Whether it\u2019d be something as small as just reading a 45 chaptered harrowing phanfic, you\u2019re allowed to be dramatic about it if you choose to. ESPECIALLY, if it has personally affected you. Don\u2019t apologize because I didn\u2019t really cancel my trip, I rescheduled it. And it\u2019s not like you forced me, I stayed because I\u2019ll always choose you.\u201d</p><p>Phil turned to face him entirely. Hand cupping Dan\u2019s left jaw, he kissed the boy\u2019s lips. Dan kissed back while holding Phil\u2019s hand on his face. The latter was pouring his previous worries and now overwhelming gratitude into the kiss, Dan was reciprocating just as much emotion but with more reassurance and comfort.</p><p>Dan pulled back slowly, leaving only a really thin space between them. \u201cBesides, you being selfish with me is something I don\u2019t mind being the cause of my extended stay here.\u201d</p><p>Softly stealing a kiss from Dan again, Phil said \u201cOf course you would know not to stop me from being dramatic, you spend almost an entire day recovering from something that made you emotional.\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\u201cUhm.. Ok, why you rude?\u201d Dan leaned back and placed his hand on his chest, fingers spread.</p><p>Phil just giggled with the usual tongue-bite-thing\u2122 and tackled Dan onto the sofa.</p><p>Old habits die hard.</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p><p>They were now next to each other on the bed, lights out. Phil\u2019s arm wrapped around Dan\u2019s waist as both of them faced one side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you tell me I spend the entire day being emotional. It took you until 2am to move on\u2026\u201d Dan mumbled.</p><p>Phil chuckled sleepily and snuggled into the crook of Dan\u2019s neck. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t let that go?\u201d</p><p>The breath on his sensitive neck made Dan shiver. \u201cShut up. I\u2019ll never forgive-\u201d</p><p>Phil noticed the reaction so he bit Dan\u2019s neck which made the younger boy jerk his head up and glared at the giggling black-haired man behind him.</p><p>\u201cPHIL!\u201d</p><p>He was full-on laughing, covering his mouth. \u201cShhh Dan!\u201d Phil said in between giggles. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep, come on.\u201d</p><p>The brunette\u2019s mouth fell open as he furrowed his brows, Dan\u2019s face spelled out you\u2019re unbelievable .</p><p>When Phil\u2019s laugh died down he suddenly felt the room was too quiet. Even though it was what\u2019s supposed to be, especially at this hour. He thought about how empty the bed would feel with just him tomorrow since his roommate\u2019s previous morning flight will most likely just turn into an evening one. He still wasn\u2019t sure about the final plans but considering Dan\u2019s presence could be a priority in that event, it might be urgent. Of course he was thankful, but he can\u2019t avoid thinking it didn\u2019t quite fully satisfy his original request.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d Dan yawned.</p><p>He poked Dan in the tummy. \u201cTomorrow night, you won\u2019t be here\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d Dan turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m not moving out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I was just wondering if you\u2019ve already bought your ticket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve got a pattern with your persuasion skills. I know where this is going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Uhh\u2026 Since you cancelled your supposed flight tomorrow morning, when\u2019s gonna be your final flight? Tomorrow\u2026 evening?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know yet. But I think so, yeah.\u201d Dan paused. \u201cWhy?\u201d he said with less curiosity and more as if he was egging Phil on.</p><p>\u201cI need one more night.\u201d Phil bit his lip. \u201cGive me one more night.\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed, defeated. Fuck it . \u201cYou sap.\u201d the boy smiled. And immediately felt also smiling lips against his own.</p><p><b>\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u2605</b></p></p>",

You were leaving so I was looking for things to distract myself from thinking about being alone&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan felt his expression go soft as he smiled fondly at Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be so immersed in the story that I&rsquo;d finish 45 chapters within 2 days-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah ok, wait a minute&hellip; 45 CHAPTERS WITHIN 2 DAYS?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil chuckled, making his tongue poke out. He didn&rsquo;t really think about the weight of that until Dan pointed it out.</p><p>The entire time Phil was narrating the summary of the phanfic, Dan was constantly disagreeing. Particularly with his character and how he reacted in the story.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this really how people see me?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I would NOT say that. What the hell&hellip;&rdquo; Dan would say and Phil would just shush him.</p><p>After some time, the story finally came to an end. &ldquo;Those were your last words. Then you&hellip; died.&rdquo; Phil breathed as if saying the last word was forbidden, his brows furrowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy fuck, that&rsquo;s brutal.&rdquo; Dan said as he massaged his forehead with one hand, leaning back to the sofa.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly why I couldn&rsquo;t really say anything when I went to you after just finishing it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan huffed. &ldquo;I mean, for the record, I wouldn&rsquo;t do OR say a lot of those things that caused shit to happen in the first place&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Everything just suddenly went back to Phil. It&rsquo;s different just hearing someone&rsquo;s summary than actually reading a phanfic or any story, generally. He didn&rsquo;t notice he was just staring blankly into space, lost in his thoughts and feelings, again .</p><p>Dan shifted closer to Phil, keeping him from mentally floating away. Using his most soothing voice, he spoke &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; taking Phil&rsquo;s hand gently and rubbing circles on his knuckles with his thumb. &ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil had the saddest eyes Dan had seen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being weird and selfish&hellip; I made you cancel your flight just so you can be with me unnecessarily being dramatic over a phanfic-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never invalidate your feelings. Whether it&rsquo;d be something as small as just reading a 45 chaptered harrowing phanfic, you&rsquo;re allowed to be dramatic about it if you choose to. ESPECIALLY, if it has personally affected you. Don&rsquo;t apologize because I didn&rsquo;t really cancel my trip, I rescheduled it. And it&rsquo;s not like you forced me, I stayed because I&rsquo;ll always choose you.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil turned to face him entirely. Hand cupping Dan&rsquo;s left jaw, he kissed the boy&rsquo;s lips. Dan kissed back while holding Phil&rsquo;s hand on his face. The latter was pouring his previous worries and now overwhelming gratitude into the kiss, Dan was reciprocating just as much emotion but with more reassurance and comfort.</p><p>Dan pulled back slowly, leaving only a really thin space between them. &ldquo;Besides, you being selfish with me is something I don&rsquo;t mind being the cause of my extended stay here.&rdquo;</p><p>Softly stealing a kiss from Dan again, Phil said &ldquo;Of course you would know not to stop me from being dramatic, you spend almost an entire day recovering from something that made you emotional.&rdquo; he grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm.. Ok, why you rude?&rdquo; Dan leaned back and placed his hand on his chest, fingers spread.</p><p>Phil just giggled with the usual tongue-bite-thing&trade; and tackled Dan onto the sofa.</p><p>Old habits die hard.</p><p><b>&#9733;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#9733;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#9733;</b></p><p>They were now next to each other on the bed, lights out. Phil&rsquo;s arm wrapped around Dan&rsquo;s waist as both of them faced one side of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare you tell me I spend the entire day being emotional. It took you until 2am to move on&hellip;&rdquo; Dan mumbled.</p><p>Phil chuckled sleepily and snuggled into the crook of Dan&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t let that go?&rdquo;</p><p>The breath on his sensitive neck made Dan shiver. &ldquo;Shut up. I&rsquo;ll never forgive-&rdquo;</p><p>Phil noticed the reaction so he bit Dan&rsquo;s neck which made the younger boy jerk his head up and glared at the giggling black-haired man behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;PHIL!&rdquo;</p><p>He was full-on laughing, covering his mouth. &ldquo;Shhh Dan!&rdquo; Phil said in between giggles. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sleep, come on.&rdquo;</p><p>The brunette&rsquo;s mouth fell open as he furrowed his brows, Dan&rsquo;s face spelled out you&rsquo;re unbelievable .</p><p>When Phil&rsquo;s laugh died down he suddenly felt the room was too quiet. Even though it was what&rsquo;s supposed to be, especially at this hour. He thought about how empty the bed would feel with just him tomorrow since his roommate&rsquo;s previous morning flight will most likely just turn into an evening one. He still wasn&rsquo;t sure about the final plans but considering Dan&rsquo;s presence could be a priority in that event, it might be urgent. Of course he was thankful, but he can&rsquo;t avoid thinking it didn&rsquo;t quite fully satisfy his original request.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Night.&rdquo; Dan yawned.</p><p>He poked Dan in the tummy. &ldquo;Tomorrow night, you won&rsquo;t be here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; Dan turned to face him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not moving out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but I was just wondering if you&rsquo;ve already bought your ticket?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems like you&rsquo;ve got a pattern with your persuasion skills. I know where this is going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right. Uhh&hellip; Since you cancelled your supposed flight tomorrow morning, when&rsquo;s gonna be your final flight? Tomorrow&hellip; evening?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know yet. But I think so, yeah.&rdquo; Dan paused. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he said with less curiosity and more as if he was egging Phil on.</p><p>&ldquo;I need one more night.&rdquo; Phil bit his lip. &ldquo;Give me one more night.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sighed, defeated. Fuck it . &ldquo;You sap.&rdquo; the boy smiled. And immediately felt also smiling lips against his own.</p><p><b>&#9733;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#9733;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;&#9733;</b></p></p>",
