They\u2019ve got to be\u2026\u201d </p><p>The Void was a small, dirty hole in the wall type of club that was mostly \u201cvoid\u201d of any customers. To the rest of the world it was by a miracle that the club managed to stay open, but to the street rats, rejects and fugitives it was no surprise; underneath the club was a dimly lit, unregistered, and illegal motel run by criminals for rejects. Although it was easily affordable, it managed to keep its rent from the mass of customers day and night. By all reasonable means this had to be the location of the aliens, assuming they were even still in the city.</p><p>The night was young, and you hoped Carol hadn\u2019t noticed your absence. You knew she wouldn\u2019t trust your newfound ability until you found the aliens; she wouldn\u2019t think of you as any more than her personal responsibility.</p><p>With a hood on your head and a deck in your hands, you knew you were ready to go. When you entered the bar you felt relaxed, despite the dark and grubby environment; it was like an old home to you. In the far right corner sat a few people, hooded like yourself, and hovered around the bar was a group of four or five figures, all averaging around 6\u20195. These had to be the targets.</p><p>Your hands grew cold while your stomach grew hot.</p><p>\u2018Keep it together,\u2019 you thought. Yeah, they were tall, but you had to remember that as far as anyone knew they didn\u2019t possess any inhuman skills. As far as anyone was concerned, you were just as powerful as they were. </p><p>You dipped your hand into your pocket, grabbing a card and then flicking it across the room. It shattered a glass by one of the figures, causing them to jolt and look your way. As you scanned them, starting from their feet up, you were surprised to see that aside from their towering heights, they looked incredibly human. This was until you reached their faces.</p><p>Like humans, they had two eyes, two ears, a mouth, and a nose. The feature that set them apart was their golf ball sized eyes made of a glass material. Each of them had one eye on you while their other one darted around the room. You stood with your feet shoulder width apart and your chest puffed out; you needed to look as intimidating as possible. </p><p>\u201cNot from around here, are you,\u201d You asked. They looked to each other and then to you, a battle ready look arranging on their faces. </p><p>\u201cAnd who are you,\u201d One of them asked in a very Alice in Wonderland type of voice.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m no one,\u201d You managed to choke out through your rising anxiety. \u201cBut you on the other hand-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre guilty of nothing but looking for a place to live,\u201d Another one interrupted you. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you muttered. \u201cSays you. However, another source tells be you\u2019ve been causing some trouble.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, you heard an all too familiar voice speak from behind you, \u201cWe\u2019re here to make sure that\u2019s not the case. Right, Y/n?\u201d </p><p>When you turned you were accompanied by none other than Carol Danvers, followed by Fury and a few other agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. Carol smiled towards you and winked. You hated to admit it, but for the second time ever you were actually glad to have her by your side. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt you or get into any fights,\u201d Fury added, his face curling in discomfort at the look of their brittle eyes. \u201cWe just like to know who we are dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Finally, one of the aliens spoke, \u201cNo one invited any of you. Go and leave us to finish our business.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d Fury continued, \u201cbut as far as I\u2019m concerned you and your big eyed faces weren\u2019t invited either.\u201d</p><p>They all stood from their bar seats, a couple of them laughing menacingly. </p><p>\u201cHumans, we will allow you one more chance-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. I was about to say the same thing,\u201d Carol said, her voice loud and unshaking. Her unfailing courage and smugness amazed you, but it was to be expected from someone who was tougher than diamonds and unfazed by bullets.</p><p>It was when you noticed a knife coming from one of the alien\u2019s sleeves that the action began. As soon as the blade was raised you knocked it from their hand with one flick of your playing card. Everything happened so fast you were hardly able to fathom it. Carol began thrusting energy blasts from her fists while the rest of the agents either took on one of the aliens or relied on their guns to do the work. You ducked, avoiding the senseless firing, and flinched as you watched the place you once called home ripped to shreds; glasses were shattered, furniture broken, and walls blazed. You cursed Carol\u2019s inability to focus her fire without being a bull in a china shop. </p><p>You had to ignore the chaos and focus on the mission. You flung cards around the room with deadly precision, and while you were throwing the perps off of their rhythm you couldn\u2019t manage to cause even a blemish. In your moment of thought you felt a pair of long, bony hands stretch around your body, pulling you into an inescapable embrace and pressing a cold, sharp weapon to your throat. </p><p>\u201cEND THIS!\u201d The alien cried breathlessly, stopping all fighting in the room. \u201cOr suffer the loss of your young!\u201d</p><p>The only movement was that of Carol and all the agents ceasing fire on the other aliens and instead focusing their weapons onto the one holding you hostage.</p><p>\u201cCarol!\u201d you shouted for her help. She nodded in response. You saw the fear in her eyes as she scanned her brain for a plan, but when she spoke you were afraid she didn\u2019t have one.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about her, dude. It never has been. This is between you and me.\u201d</p><p>The alien pushed the knife closer to your neck in response. You felt him blink; it shook his entire body.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d Fury stated, raising his gun in surrender. He motioned for his agents to do the same. Soon the only brandished weapons belonged to the enemy. A few of them huddled around Carol and snatched her arms, pulling them swiftly behind her back.</p><p>She looked lost, as did the other agents. You watched in horror as the aliens sneered at you, taunting your inability to move. </p><p>You scanned your brain for anything to help free you; if Carol or the agents couldn\u2019t blast without hitting you then it was time for you to take action. You decided to close your eyes and think, but nothing came to mind except your \u201ctraining\u201d back at the apartment and how it wasn\u2019t enough. All you were able to do was throw cards, and the only damage you did was to those stupid glass bulbs. If only the aliens were made of glass&hellip;</p><p>All hope was lost until you felt the alien blink again. Suddenly it was so obvious. </p><p>When you opened your eyes, the first person you looked to was Carol. You smirked at her as she once did to you, and she couldn\u2019t have been more confused. You grabbed about 12 cards, took a breath, and began flicking them around the room at full speed, aiming for those disgusting, beady eyes. </p><p>The room filled with the sound of shattering glass and howls from the aliens as they grasped at their eyes. You were freed and watched as the agents jumped into action, pinning the enemies to the ground and cuffing them. Carol looked to you in utter amazement. She ran to you and embraced you tighter than you\u2019d ever been before.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that was incredible,\u201d She whispered. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Fury yelled. \u201cGive me a hand, Danvers.\u201d </p><p>She gave you one last look of pure love and ran to help Fury. </p><p>Finally! Finally, you proved that you\u2019re not just some poor card magician from the streets. You proved that you, y/n y/l/n, were the most badass kid that Captain Marvel had ever met.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this! Make sure to check out parts 1 and 2!! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95</p>",

They\u2019ve got to be\u2026\u201d </p><p>The Void was a small, dirty hole in the wall type of club that was mostly \u201cvoid\u201d of any customers. To the rest of the world it was by a miracle that the club managed to stay open, but to the street rats, rejects and fugitives it was no surprise; underneath the club was a dimly lit, unregistered, and illegal motel run by criminals for rejects. Although it was easily affordable, it managed to keep its rent from the mass of customers day and night. By all reasonable means this had to be the location of the aliens, assuming they were even still in the city.</p><p>The night was young, and you hoped Carol hadn\u2019t noticed your absence. You knew she wouldn\u2019t trust your newfound ability until you found the aliens; she wouldn\u2019t think of you as any more than her personal responsibility.</p><p>With a hood on your head and a deck in your hands, you knew you were ready to go. When you entered the bar you felt relaxed, despite the dark and grubby environment; it was like an old home to you. In the far right corner sat a few people, hooded like yourself, and hovered around the bar was a group of four or five figures, all averaging around 6\u20195. These had to be the targets.</p><p>Your hands grew cold while your stomach grew hot.</p><p>\u2018Keep it together,\u2019 you thought. Yeah, they were tall, but you had to remember that as far as anyone knew they didn\u2019t possess any inhuman skills. As far as anyone was concerned, you were just as powerful as they were. </p><p>You dipped your hand into your pocket, grabbing a card and then flicking it across the room. It shattered a glass by one of the figures, causing them to jolt and look your way. As you scanned them, starting from their feet up, you were surprised to see that aside from their towering heights, they looked incredibly human. This was until you reached their faces.</p><p>Like humans, they had two eyes, two ears, a mouth, and a nose. The feature that set them apart was their golf ball sized eyes made of a glass material. Each of them had one eye on you while their other one darted around the room. You stood with your feet shoulder width apart and your chest puffed out; you needed to look as intimidating as possible. </p><p>\u201cNot from around here, are you,\u201d You asked. They looked to each other and then to you, a battle ready look arranging on their faces. </p><p>\u201cAnd who are you,\u201d One of them asked in a very Alice in Wonderland type of voice.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m no one,\u201d You managed to choke out through your rising anxiety. \u201cBut you on the other hand-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre guilty of nothing but looking for a place to live,\u201d Another one interrupted you. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you muttered. \u201cSays you. However, another source tells be you\u2019ve been causing some trouble.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, you heard an all too familiar voice speak from behind you, \u201cWe\u2019re here to make sure that\u2019s not the case. Right, Y/n?\u201d </p><p>When you turned you were accompanied by none other than Carol Danvers, followed by Fury and a few other agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. Carol smiled towards you and winked. You hated to admit it, but for the second time ever you were actually glad to have her by your side. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt you or get into any fights,\u201d Fury added, his face curling in discomfort at the look of their brittle eyes. \u201cWe just like to know who we are dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Finally, one of the aliens spoke, \u201cNo one invited any of you. Go and leave us to finish our business.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d Fury continued, \u201cbut as far as I\u2019m concerned you and your big eyed faces weren\u2019t invited either.\u201d</p><p>They all stood from their bar seats, a couple of them laughing menacingly. </p><p>\u201cHumans, we will allow you one more chance-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. I was about to say the same thing,\u201d Carol said, her voice loud and unshaking. Her unfailing courage and smugness amazed you, but it was to be expected from someone who was tougher than diamonds and unfazed by bullets.</p><p>It was when you noticed a knife coming from one of the alien\u2019s sleeves that the action began. As soon as the blade was raised you knocked it from their hand with one flick of your playing card. Everything happened so fast you were hardly able to fathom it. Carol began thrusting energy blasts from her fists while the rest of the agents either took on one of the aliens or relied on their guns to do the work. You ducked, avoiding the senseless firing, and flinched as you watched the place you once called home ripped to shreds; glasses were shattered, furniture broken, and walls blazed. You cursed Carol\u2019s inability to focus her fire without being a bull in a china shop. </p><p>You had to ignore the chaos and focus on the mission. You flung cards around the room with deadly precision, and while you were throwing the perps off of their rhythm you couldn\u2019t manage to cause even a blemish. In your moment of thought you felt a pair of long, bony hands stretch around your body, pulling you into an inescapable embrace and pressing a cold, sharp weapon to your throat. </p><p>\u201cEND THIS!\u201d The alien cried breathlessly, stopping all fighting in the room. \u201cOr suffer the loss of your young!\u201d</p><p>The only movement was that of Carol and all the agents ceasing fire on the other aliens and instead focusing their weapons onto the one holding you hostage.</p><p>\u201cCarol!\u201d you shouted for her help. She nodded in response. You saw the fear in her eyes as she scanned her brain for a plan, but when she spoke you were afraid she didn\u2019t have one.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about her, dude. It never has been. This is between you and me.\u201d</p><p>The alien pushed the knife closer to your neck in response. You felt him blink; it shook his entire body.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d Fury stated, raising his gun in surrender. He motioned for his agents to do the same. Soon the only brandished weapons belonged to the enemy. A few of them huddled around Carol and snatched her arms, pulling them swiftly behind her back.</p><p>She looked lost, as did the other agents. You watched in horror as the aliens sneered at you, taunting your inability to move. </p><p>You scanned your brain for anything to help free you; if Carol or the agents couldn\u2019t blast without hitting you then it was time for you to take action. You decided to close your eyes and think, but nothing came to mind except your \u201ctraining\u201d back at the apartment and how it wasn\u2019t enough. All you were able to do was throw cards, and the only damage you did was to those stupid glass bulbs. If only the aliens were made of glass\u2026</p><p>All hope was lost until you felt the alien blink again. Suddenly it was so obvious. </p><p>When you opened your eyes, the first person you looked to was Carol. You smirked at her as she once did to you, and she couldn\u2019t have been more confused. You grabbed about 12 cards, took a breath, and began flicking them around the room at full speed, aiming for those disgusting, beady eyes. </p><p>The room filled with the sound of shattering glass and howls from the aliens as they grasped at their eyes. You were freed and watched as the agents jumped into action, pinning the enemies to the ground and cuffing them. Carol looked to you in utter amazement. She ran to you and embraced you tighter than you\u2019d ever been before.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that was incredible,\u201d She whispered. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Fury yelled. \u201cGive me a hand, Danvers.\u201d </p><p>She gave you one last look of pure love and ran to help Fury. </p><p>Finally! Finally, you proved that you\u2019re not just some poor card magician from the streets. You proved that you, y/n y/l/n, were the most badass kid that Captain Marvel had ever met.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this! Make sure to check out parts 1 and 2!! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95</p></p>",

As soon as the blade was raised you knocked it from their hand with one flick of your playing card. Everything happened so fast you were hardly able to fathom it. Carol began thrusting energy blasts from her fists while the rest of the agents either took on one of the aliens or relied on their guns to do the work. You ducked, avoiding the senseless firing, and flinched as you watched the place you once called home ripped to shreds; glasses were shattered, furniture broken, and walls blazed. You cursed Carol&rsquo;s inability to focus her fire without being a bull in a china shop. </p><p>You had to ignore the chaos and focus on the mission. You flung cards around the room with deadly precision, and while you were throwing the perps off of their rhythm you couldn&rsquo;t manage to cause even a blemish. In your moment of thought you felt a pair of long, bony hands stretch around your body, pulling you into an inescapable embrace and pressing a cold, sharp weapon to your throat. </p><p>&ldquo;END THIS!&rdquo; The alien cried breathlessly, stopping all fighting in the room. &ldquo;Or suffer the loss of your young!&rdquo;</p><p>The only movement was that of Carol and all the agents ceasing fire on the other aliens and instead focusing their weapons onto the one holding you hostage.</p><p>&ldquo;Carol!&rdquo; you shouted for her help. She nodded in response. You saw the fear in her eyes as she scanned her brain for a plan, but when she spoke you were afraid she didn&rsquo;t have one.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about her, dude. It never has been. This is between you and me.&rdquo;</p><p>The alien pushed the knife closer to your neck in response. You felt him blink; it shook his entire body.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to do this,&rdquo; Fury stated, raising his gun in surrender. He motioned for his agents to do the same. Soon the only brandished weapons belonged to the enemy. A few of them huddled around Carol and snatched her arms, pulling them swiftly behind her back.</p><p>She looked lost, as did the other agents. You watched in horror as the aliens sneered at you, taunting your inability to move. </p><p>You scanned your brain for anything to help free you; if Carol or the agents couldn&rsquo;t blast without hitting you then it was time for you to take action. You decided to close your eyes and think, but nothing came to mind except your &ldquo;training&rdquo; back at the apartment and how it wasn&rsquo;t enough. All you were able to do was throw cards, and the only damage you did was to those stupid glass bulbs. If only the aliens were made of glass&hellip;</p><p>All hope was lost until you felt the alien blink again. Suddenly it was so obvious. </p><p>When you opened your eyes, the first person you looked to was Carol. You smirked at her as she once did to you, and she couldn&rsquo;t have been more confused. You grabbed about 12 cards, took a breath, and began flicking them around the room at full speed, aiming for those disgusting, beady eyes. </p><p>The room filled with the sound of shattering glass and howls from the aliens as they grasped at their eyes. You were freed and watched as the agents jumped into action, pinning the enemies to the ground and cuffing them. Carol looked to you in utter amazement. She ran to you and embraced you tighter than you&rsquo;d ever been before.</p><p>&ldquo;That&hellip; that was incredible,&rdquo; She whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Fury yelled. &ldquo;Give me a hand, Danvers.&rdquo; </p><p>She gave you one last look of pure love and ran to help Fury. </p><p>Finally! Finally, you proved that you&rsquo;re not just some poor card magician from the streets. You proved that you, y/n y/l/n, were the most badass kid that Captain Marvel had ever met.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this! Make sure to check out parts 1 and 2!! &#128149;&#128149;</p></p>",
