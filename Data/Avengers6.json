He blew out a quick breath and waited. It didn\u2019t turn to steam, so that was a good sign\u2026. right?</p><p>\u201cJarvis?\u201d </p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cJarvis?\u201d He tried again.</p><p>The AI didn\u2019t respond and Bucky was starting to panic. That\u2019s when he heard it. A yell come from the comman room, he didn\u2019t even think about his options as he sprinted towards it, noticing how cold it was becoming. His heart pounded. </p><p>Skidding into the room, the avengers were sprawled on the floor, you were stood in the middle of them.

You falling, him screaming your name, him running, one of his former handlers saying the words. As Bucky cover his ears trying to block the voice out, he missed your eyes snapping open. </p><p>As Bucky tried to block out the laughter, trying not not hear the words. He heard the fourth one before another yell broke through the room. His head snapped up to see you now standing. Hair white, just like his dream. </p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d You snarled.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d The man taunted.</p><p>You seemed to think about this before you begun stalking over to him. Under your foot ice covered the floor as hit slowly crept around the room. Bucky needed to calm down but as his eyes landed on the other he needed to get them out as well. With another glance at you, be staggered up, looping his arms under thro as he begun to drag the got to the elevator. Going back for Steve, Peitro and Clint. </p><p>He grabbed Tony and Bruce by their shirts and dragged them over. Pressing the down button he was thankful it still worked. The rooms temperature had dramatically dropped so he had to be quick. Bucky ran over, hauling Natasha and Wanda over his shoulders as he brought them to the other elevator and gently laid them down. Pulling Loki over he looked around, eyes landing on Pepper who was cuddled near a cabnit. </p><p>Running over he pulled his hoodie of and threw it over her shivering form. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He whispered. </p><p>\u201cY\u2026yeah\u2026.\u201d </p><p>Bucky glances over at you at the scientist before back at her. Picking her up bridal style, he took her to the others before sending that elevator down as well. Now, he turned back to you. </p><p>You had finally walked over, and you just stood there. Horror now washed over the mans face, realising what kind of trouble his was in. His eyes flicked over to Bucky, his mouth opening. Your hand to his chest and stopped, before you tapped him lightly, his whole body instantly covered in ice. And with another tap, he shattered.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Bucky called. </p><p>You didn\u2019t respond, he dared to walk a few steps closer. </p><p>\u201cDoll?\u201d </p><p>You turned to him, but not a glimmer of recognition was on your face. You stalked over to him, Bucky tried to walk back but his feet were stuck. I\u2019ve slowly crawled up his legs as you got closer. Making its way up to his waist by the time you were in front of him. </p><p>Outside snow rained down on the city, thunder shook the building. You stared him in the eyes as you stood there, and for once, Bucky was terrified. He was terrified of what you could do, what were you capable of doing?</p><p>\u201c(Y/N), you need to stop.\u201d He whispered.</p><p>Your hand reached out, stopping at his chest. Bucky could hear his hear in his ears, leaning back as much as he could to avoid being touched. He tore his eyes from your gaze and focused on your neck. There was blood there, a large splatter of it frozen to your skin. It leaked onto your shirt staining the fabric. But there was no wound.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d He pleaded.</p><p>You stopped, millimetres in front of him. Turning your head the window, back to him and then back to the window. Dropping your arm, without a single word you begun to make your way to it and Bucky begun to panic. He couldn\u2019t let you out. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) doll, listen, you don\u2019t want to to this. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t look back, and he begun to panic even more.</p><p>With his metal arm he begun to punch the ice, but it had no effect. You stood before the window, placing your hand on the glass, ice creeped around it before it shattered outward. In the blink of en eye you were gone. </p><p>Bucky begun hitting the ice even more, finally cracking it a little, the only thought on his mind was he had to get out, he had to get to you before you hurt someone or yourself.

Hence why murdering baby Thanos wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31d9a15e8f2e4bc6f9a5b6e171a35515/tumblr_prjg4u7XOm1v74pzb_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Going back in time and killing baby Thanos wouldn&rsquo;t effect the events of Infinity war, the same as killing 2014 Thanos didn&rsquo;t resurrect Loki, Gamora, or Vision. So when Cap time traveled to return the stones and prevent branched realities. When he stayed he essentially created his own branched off reality where he could marry Peggy, Save Bucky from Hydra, prevent the deaths of the Stark parents, and none of it would effect the present timeline. Upon Peggy&rsquo;s death (Most likely) in 2016 Cap Used the time travel to return to the main timeline with the shield from the alternate as a gift for Sam to take up the new mantle of Captain America.</p><p>Also a fun thing to point out, in the alternate timeline if Cap stopped Hydra from sending Bucky out on missions, JFK is likely still alive in that timeline, and Tony probably had an Uncle Steve, Aunt Peggy, and Uncle Bucky.</p></p>",
