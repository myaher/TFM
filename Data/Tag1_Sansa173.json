        "body": "<p>January 6, 2019</p><p>When is a mistake not a mistake? \u00a0I\u2019ve been pondering this question since I came across a repetitive line in <i>The Hedge Knight</i>. \u00a0Don\u2019t get me wrong!\u00a0 There are other instances of George repeating phrases in the text. \u00a0What\u2019s different about this one is the closeness of the repetition.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>This particular phrase is repeated so closely to the first mention that while at a quick glance it seemed like a mistake, it had to be deliberate on Martin\u2019s part with the intent to draw the reader\u2019s attention to a point surrounding the repetition? \u00a0Writers have been known to repeat lines in this manner for emphasis and to highlight a theme. \u00a0This is popularly done with poetry but it can be found in prose as well. \u00a0</p><p>George himself has done it several times that I\u2019ve come across in the various books that make up the series\u2014generally I think to highlight a point or to draw comparison to an idea. \u00a0Usually it\u2019s spread out between books or point of views of different characters. \u00a0Although it has happened a few times, it is also usually not a word for word repeat of the phrase. \u00a0This is why when I came across two repetitive lines in back to back chapters of <i>The Hedge Knight</i> during a recent re-read, I wasn\u2019t sure what to think. \u00a0The reason for my uncertainty is because the lines in question are so mundane that I initially thought it was an error that was missed. \u00a0However, it was the very run-of-the-mill wording of the sentences that made me think it might have been deliberate.</p><p>Let\u2019s take a look at the repetitive lines to see what I\u2019m talking about. \u00a0One of the passages I posted in the previous chapter when discussing the probability that Jonquil was a redhead. \u00a0I\u2019m repeating it here in its entirety but I am also including a few additional lines to draw attention not just to the phrase repetition but also to show the similarity of the two passages. \u00a0The repeated line is in bold font.</p><blockquote><p>By the time he splashed back across the ford to the south bank of the Cockleswent, the morning was almost done and the tourney grounds had come to life once more. </p><p><b>The winesellers and sausage makers were doing a brisk trade</b>, a dancing bear was shuffling along to his master&rsquo;s playing as a singer sang &ldquo;The Bear, the Bear, and the Maiden Fair,&rdquo; jugglers were juggling, and the puppeteers were just finishing another fight.</p><p>Dunk stopped to watch the wooden dragon slain. When the puppet knight cut its head off and the red sawdust spilled out onto the grass, he laughed aloud and threw the girl two coppers. &ldquo;One for last night,\u201d he called. She caught the coins in the air and threw him back a smile as sweet as any he had ever seen. \u00a0Is it me she smiles at, or the coins? Dunk had never been with a girl, and they made him nervous. Once, three years past, when the old man&rsquo;s purse was full after half a year in the service of blind Lord Florent, he&rsquo;d told Dunk the time had come to take him to a brothel and make him a man. He&rsquo;d been drunk, though, and when he was sober he did not remember. Dunk had been too embarrassed to remind him.</p><p>He was not certain he wanted a whore anyway. If he could not have a highborn maiden like a proper knight, he wanted one who at least liked him more than his silver.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><!-- more --><p>Try as I might not to do so, when I write, I tend to repeat phrases a bit too often. \u00a0In fact, I\u2019m pretty confident that I\u2019ve probably done so in this essay series. It\u2019s not deliberate on my part but simply a matter of complacency because I\u2019m not a true writer and so tend to resort to crutch phrases.</p><p>On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that any author as talented as George would mistakenly use the same sentence in back to back chapters and not be aware of it. \u00a0Also, not even a junior editor let alone one who has been at it as long as George\u2019s editor, Anne Groell, would miss that type of mistake by their author. \u00a0And if by some strange chance both the author and editor did miss the mistake, the copyeditor whose job it is to read the manuscript and catch such errors would not.</p><p>However, there are no absolutes in life and while highly unlikely, one cannot say with 100% certainty that it was not a simple mistake. \u00a0I tend to think that if it were, it would have been found by now and corrected in subsequent printings of the book, which has not been the case. \u00a0This suggests that the repetition of the two lines was deliberate on George\u2019s part.</p><p>As the odds are against those involved with the writing and production of the book missing the error, let\u2019s work under the assumption that it was deliberate and speculate on what George might have been trying to highlight by looking at the similarities between the two excerpts.</p><p>In the first passage posted above, Dunk throws Tanselle two coppers in appreciation of her performance during the puppet show. \u00a0One of the coppers he tells her is for last night\u2026meaning the puppet performance, which he also saw the night before. \u00a0However, the throwing of the coins and his use of the phrase, \u201cone for last night\u201d in and of itself has very strong inferences of the paying of a whore. \u00a0</p><p>This is reinforced by his thoughts after Tanselle smiles at him upon receiving the coins. \u00a0He wonders whether the smile is for him or his coins and he thinks back on an event three years past when a drunken Ser Arlan promised to take him to a brothel for his first time with a woman. \u00a0As the old man was drunk, he forgot and by the time he meets Tanselle, Dunk is still a virgin. \u00a0</p><p>The above passage continues with Dunk inviting Tanselle to share a horn of ale. In mythology the horn symbolize male sexuality and in western cultures, sausages are often associated with the male genitals, which makes the words Martin uses overtly sexual.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Will you drink a horn of ale?&rdquo; he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. &ldquo;With me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They&rsquo;re made with pork, I think.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>It makes one wonder what Martin is implying when he says the wine sellers and sausage makers are doing a brisk trade. \u00a0We also shouldn\u2019t forget that as he walked toward the puppeteers, Dunk passed a dancing bear and a bard singing <i>The Bear and the Maiden Fair</i>, which is a highly sexual song. \u00a0This song is also strongly associated with Sansa in the story proper as Butterbumps sings it in its entirety during her interrogation by the Queen of Thorns. \u00a0Now here we see Martin also associating it with Jonquil.</p><p>The wine seller and sausage maker line is repeated in the very next chapter and again it occurs as Dunk approaches the pavilion where the puppeteers are performing the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0Also again it is associated with thoughts of money and a whore as he spies the redheaded one across the way and considers paying for her services. \u00a0He is concerned that she might rob him while he sleeps and so passes on the opportunity.</p><blockquote><p><b>The wine sellers and sausage makers were doing a brisk trade</b>, and whores walked brazenly among the stalls and pavilions. Some were pretty enough, one red-haired girl in particular. He could not help staring at her breasts, the way they moved under her loose shift as she sauntered past. He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She&rsquo;d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous &hellip; but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the red-haired girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, Dunk shook his head and walked away.</p><p>He found Egg at the puppet show, sitting crosslegged on the ground with the hood of his cloak pulled all the way forward to hide his baldness. </p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>The young knight with the raging hormones watches another performance of the puppet show and has his second conversation with Jonquil afterwards. However, I will be leaving a breakdown of the dialogue from that specific scene for when I discuss Florian and Jonquil as a couple.</p><p>Both passages of course talk about the heavy business occurring at the booths of the wine sellers and sausage makers and takes place right before Dunk\u2019s interaction with Tanselle and exposition on the story of Florian and Jonquill via the puppet shows. \u00a0The two passages also include an overt amount of sexual dialogue and thoughts on Dunk\u2019s part\u2026particularly regarding whores.</p><p>Why this striking association of whores in the Florian and Jonquil story? \u00a0It\u2019s not just the scenes with Dunk but also how Martin uses Dancy the whore at Chatya\u2019s establishment in Kings Landing to possibly hint at Jonquil. \u00a0And Sansa is of course currently under the control of Petyr, a brothel owner. \u00a0She has not been forced into prostitution but her best friend Jeyne was not so lucky. \u00a0In addition to prostitution, Jeyne has been forced to marry Ramsay Bolton as an Arya stand-in.\u00a0 It\u2019s also not just Sansa and Jeyne as in the Mercy preview chapter from TWOW, Arya plays the part of a lady of the evening in her quest to cross a name off her list.</p><p>I have to say that I was stumped when I discovered this connection to whores in the sister\u2019s storyline until a possible explanation came to me about what Martin maybe symbolically implying. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s possible that one of the reasons we get so many references to whores in the story is that as he is using Jon as the symbolic Last Hero/Christ like figure in the story who will return from the dead to be the savior of mankind, Jonquil/Sansa may represents his Mary Magdalene counterpart. </p><p>Like with the tale of Christ\u2019s resurrection, there are many different versions to the biblical myths surrounding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Magdalene</a>\u2014including the earlier belief that she was a repentant prostitute. She is often conflated with <a href=\"https://en.wikip\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Bethany</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7:36%E2%80%9350&amp;version=NRSV\" target=\"_blank\">sinful woman</a> who washed Christ\u2019s feet as referenced in the Gospel of Luke. \u00a0And there are some biblical scholars who believe that there was some type of romantic relationship between Christ and Mary. </p><p>Another woman of whom Mary Magdalene is confused is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Egypt\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Egypt</a>, the prostitute who later became a saint. \u00a0In fact, in some Medieval paintings, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Egypt are rendered in similar manner with a skull to signify their penitence, which no doubt contributed to the confusion between the two.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"753\" data-orig-height=\"477\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab7d4aed5ae22e300775b9346612c074/tumblr_inline_pkxn5ukBgN1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"753\" data-orig-height=\"477\"/></figure><blockquote><p>(Left) Mary Magdalene with the Smoking Flame by\u00a0Georges de La Tour [Public domain], courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Georges_de_La_Tour_-_Magdalen_of_Night_Light_-_WGA12337.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>; (Right) Mary of Egypt by\u00a0Jusepe de Ribera [Public domain] courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:S._Maria_Egiziaca_by_Jusepe_de_Ribera.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>Now before anyone starts wondering if I am saying that Jonquil was a prostitute, the answer is no. \u00a0I don\u2019t believe that was the case. \u00a0I am talking about George adding texture to the story. \u00a0It is part of his world building. \u00a0He is playing with the mythological story of Christ throughout his story as the savior of man. \u00a0This includes the Last Hero and his 12 Apostle like companions and now Jon and his future Christ like return from the dead. </p><p>The show had Jon going beyond the Wall with 12 companions on the wight hunt and it\u2019s possible that something similar will happen in the books as well. \u00a0I don\u2019t expect something as stupid as a wight hunt but I think that we can all agree that the Wall will fall. \u00a0And as others before me have speculated, I can see Jon and 12 companions heading further north for a final showdown with the Others that would in some way mirror the events with the Last Hero. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Mary Magdalene like the 12 disciples is a major part of the Christian myth about the Christ and a big part of her legend is the belief by some that she was a prostitute. \u00a0It is this belief that I think Martin maybe playing with to add texture to his story. \u00a0</p><p>This does not mean Jonquil was a whore as Mary Magdalene most likely was not one. \u00a0It simply means that Martin is possibly playing with the idea of this part of her myth. \u00a0He has played with it in other ways in the text. There is actually a scene with Jon in ACOK, which I\u2019ve discussed in a previous essay series that echoes the resurrection of the Christ and Mary Magdalene being the first one to discover his return.</p><blockquote><p>He woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air. When he moved, his bones ached. Ghost was gone, the fire burnt out. <b>Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he\u2019d hung over the rock, and found it stiff and frozen</b>. \u00a0He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal.</p><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every blade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond. \u00a0Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen . Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice.</p><p><i>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all</i>. \u00a0He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he\u2019d dreamed of them last night. \u00a0Sansa would call this an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but Arya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all.</p><p>\u201c<i>Lord Snow</i>?\u201d he heard. Soft and meek. He turned.</p><p><b>Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper</b>, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her. Sam&rsquo;s cloak, Jon realized at once. Why is she wearing Sam&rsquo;s cloak? &ldquo;The fat one told me I&rsquo;d find you here, m'lord,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>In the scene above, Jon\u2019s little sleeping chamber that he created by hanging his cloak at the opening to protect him from the elements represents is the symbolic tomb of Christ. \u00a0And when he pulls it aside to crawl out, he is symbolically rolling back the rock that sealed Christ\u2019s tomb. \u00a0His black brothers or symbolic disciples are still asleep and so are not aware that he has arisen. \u00a0His cold breath and aching bones also signify that he has come back from the other side where he was symbolically frozen in death. \u00a0It also hints at his future death and the vision Bran saw of him in the ice cave as his body lost all warmth.</p><p>Gilly symbolically plays two roles in the scene. \u00a0With her wearing Sam\u2019s cloak, she is symbolically his wife, which hints at their future relationship. \u00a0However, as the only person there when Jon exits his symbolic tomb, she also takes on the role of Mary Magdalene.</p><p>There are different versions of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ in the various gospels but the common denominator in all is the presence Mary Magdalene at his death, burial and as one of the first witnesses of his empty tomb.</p><p>In some telling of the story, Mary is one of the three women who discover the stone removed from the tomb of Christ. \u00a0They enter to find the body gone and the presence of an angel who tells them that Christ has risen and they should go and spread the word to his disciples. In two other gospels they don\u2019t enter the tomb but an angel rolls away the rock and tells them that Christ has risen. \u00a0Jesus then appears to them and tells them to go and notify the disciples that he has risen and to meet him in Galilee. \u00a0And in the Gospel of John, Mary goes to the tomb alone and it is there that the Christ appears to her.</p><blockquote><p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:1\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:1\u201310</a>, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb alone when it was still dark and saw that the stone had already been rolled away. \u00a0She did not see anyone, but immediately ran to tell Peter and the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved\" target=\"_blank\">beloved disciple</a>,&rdquo; who came with her to the tomb and confirmed that it was empty but returned home without seeing the risen Jesus. \u00a0According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:11\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:11\u201318</a>, Mary, now alone in the garden outside the tomb, saw two angels sitting where Jesus&rsquo;s body had been. \u00a0Then the risen Jesus approached her. \u00a0She at first mistook him for the gardener, but, after she heard him say her name, she recognized him and cried out &ldquo;Rabbouni!&rdquo; (which is Aramaic for \u201cteacher&quot;). \u00a0She tried to touch him, but he told her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my father.\u201d \u00a0Jesus then sent her to tell the other apostles the good news of his resurrection. \u00a0The Gospel of John therefore portrays Mary Magdalene as the first apostle, the apostle sent <i>to</i> the apostles.</p><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a></p></blockquote><p>Jon thinks that there is magic beyond the Wall. \u00a0In the story, life beyond the Wall denotes another life for the people of Westeros. \u00a0It\u2019s the symbolic \u201cother side.\u201d \u00a0And so Jon\u2019s viewing it as magical can be said to tie into the Christian belief of a second life.</p><p>Arya and Sansa enter his thoughts when he sees the crystallization of the forests. \u00a0His thoughts of them figuratively add two additional women to the scene and with Gilly\u2019s literal presence there are symbolically three women there at his return, which plays into the other biblical myths of three women being present at the return of the Christ.</p><p>In my essay, <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/172429311701/waking-in-a-winter-wonderland-an-analys\" target=\"_blank\">Waking in a Winter Wonderland</a><i>,</i> I argued that Sansa\u2019s snowy garden scene in the Eyrie was a symbolic continuation of the icy Jon one from the haunted forest posted above. \u00a0I have also argued that there are strong clues in Sansa\u2019s scene that suggest Jon will be in the Vale. \u00a0Now after reading the biblical verse where the risen Christ approaches Mary Magdalene\u2026most likely as dawn was breaking, I feel even more strongly that I\u2019m on to something.</p><blockquote><p><b>Dawn stole into her garden like a thief.</b> The grey of the sky grew lighter still, and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath <b>their stoles of snow</b>.</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Sansa VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Christ was the sun/son who brought the dawn and hope for mankind with his return from the dead. \u00a0In the story told in the central books of the series, Jon is the symbolic sun/son and with him comes the dawn. \u00a0When he first appeared to her, Mary Magdalene thought Christ was the gardener arriving for work, which suggest that his tomb was located in a garden. \u00a0 As she was alone there in the morning, it was symbolically her garden he entered. \u00a0And just as dawn in the form of Christ entered Mary Magdalene\u2019s garden, it also steals into Sansa\u2019s but in her case, the bringer of dawn is symbolically Jon.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>FLORIAN AND JONQUIL, AND THE BLUE WINTER ROSE</b></p><p>This next section was previously published as a preview of this essay series. \u00a0You can find the article <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/178966949166/florian-and-jonquil-jon-and-sansa-and-the-blue\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>The Dunk and Egg novellas are some of the most enjoyable stories of the entire series and I highly recommend reading them. \u00a0Recently, as I sat on the train during the evening commute, getting lost again in their adventures, one of my theories jumped out at me from one of the drawings in <i>The Hedge Knight</i>.</p><p>If you have read my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/166683154156/of-sansa-stark-the-glass-menagerie-the-rose-of-sharon-jo\" target=\"_blank\">Of Stark and the Glass Menagerie</a> essay, you are aware of my theory that the famous Blue Winter Rose is actually the jonquil flower. \u00a0There are several reasons for this theory not the least being that the modern rose is a cultivated flower that did not exist during medieval or more ancient times. \u00a0However, the jonquil flower did and it was considered by many to be a wild rose. \u00a0In fact many scholars believe that the narcissus-jonquilla is actually the Rose of Sharon flower referenced in the famous biblical poem, <i>Song of Solomon</i>.</p><blockquote><p>Female</p><p>I am the rose of Sharon,<br/>\nand the lily of the valleys. <br/></p><p>Male</p><p>As the lily among thorns,<br/>\nso is my love among the daughters. </p></blockquote><p>It is my theory that while the blue winter rose Dany saw in the chink in the wall tips to Lyanna as Jon\u2019s mother, in the story proper, it is more indicative of Sansa Stark, her importance to the story; connection to Jon Snow; and their future relationship.</p><p>I think that hints of this relationship is there in many of the ancient tales because just as George uses the story proper to provide clues to the stories of the past, he also uses the tales and songs of times past as hints to the current story. One such ancient tale that I think Martin uses to strongly denote things to come in the books are the story about Florian and Jonquil. </p><p>And so, there I was sitting on the train, getting lost in the adventures of Dunk and Egg when suddenly a drawing of Florian and Jonquil jump out at me. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen this drawing a million times and yet there is something about the image that I never noticed until that night. \u00a0</p><p>Those of you familiar with the Dunk and Egg stories will know that black and white line drawings are included throughout. \u00a0These drawings showcase various scenes from the books and are pretty exact representation of the scene described. \u00a0Here is one from Egg\u2019s confrontation with his older brother Aerion Brightflame.</p><p>The hands holding his left arm were gone, and then the others. Dunk did not understand what was happening. The men-at-arms were backing away. One even knelt. Then the crowd parted for Raymun Fossoway. He had donned mail and helm, and his hand was on his sword. His cousin Ser Steffon, just behind him, had already bared his blade, and with them were a half-dozen men-at-arms with the red apple badge sewn on their breasts.</p><p>Prince Aerion paid them no mind. &quot;Impudent little wretch,&rdquo; he said to Egg, spitting a mouthful of blood at the boy&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;What happened to your hair?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cut it off, brother,&rdquo; said Egg. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to look like you.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1235\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cde62a095830ab91c944fc3000ade4/tumblr_inline_pkxcd8w5aj1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1235\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"/></figure><p>Noticed that even the spittle from Aerion is included in the drawing. \u00a0I mention all this and showed the image with Egg to demonstrate how detail the drawings are in rendering the scene described.</p><p>I am pretty confident that as is most likely the case with any official image associated with ASOIAF, George approved all drawings used in the Dunk and Egg novella in advance of publication of the books. \u00a0This is why I find the Florian and Jonquil image to be very curious in nature. \u00a0During the puppet show, Florian is described as kneeling to Jonquil and here is the scene shown in the drawing.

And yet, there is one shown in the drawing.\u00a0 This is not to say that the word rose is never mentioned in the text.\u00a0 Leo Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden at the time is present and and so the word is used in relation to him.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it is never once used to refer to either Jonquil or Tanselle and yet one is shown in the illustration.\u00a0</p><p>Now the drawings are in black and white and so there is no color assigned to the rose in the image.\u00a0 However, as Jonquil is so closely associated with Sansa Stark who is a symbolic blue winter rose, I would harbor a guess that the reader is meant to see the rose on the floor as a blue rose.\u00a0 To me, this strongly indicates that the blue rose connects to the story of Florian and Jonquil and so the question then becomes why?</p><p>There are two iconic flowers in the story and they both connect to the daughters of House Stark. \u00a0When I refer to the jonquil as an iconic flower in the story it is not to say that the physical flower appears in the tale\u2014at least not yet. \u00a0However, it does appear symbolically in the form of Sansa, the eldest daughter of House Stark. \u00a0My question to you is what do you think the odds are that both flowers strongly associated with the daughter of the most important family in the story are two totally different sweet smelling blooms? \u00a0I say it\u2019s little to none.</p><p>The physical jonquil flower may not have appeared in the story proper but it may in the future when we learn more about the fair maiden who bore its name.\u00a0 And it would not matter if it doesn\u2019t make an appearance because ultimately it\u2019s about the symbolism and it is very present in Sansa\u2019s arc.\u00a0 Jonquil in a way was the symbolic Rose of Sharon.\u00a0 She was the lily of the valley or vale as it were since the two words are synonyms of each other.</p><p>As I also discussed in my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/171001805336/speaker-of-the-dead-or-do-direwolves-dream-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Do Direwolves Dream of the Weirwood Net</a> essay, Persephone was kidnapped while picking jonquils from the Vale of Nysa, a mountainous valley very like the Vale of Arryn in the books.</p><blockquote><p>In the Homeric \u201c<a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292\" target=\"_blank\">Hymn to Demeter</a>,\u201d the story is told of how <b>Persephone was gathering flowers in the Vale of Nysa</b> when she was seized by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hades-Greek-mythology\" target=\"_blank\">Hades</a> and removed to the underworld. Upon learning of the abduction, her mother, Demeter, in her misery, became unconcerned with the harvest or the fruitfulness of the earth, so that widespread famine ensued. Zeus therefore intervened, commanding Hades to release Persephone to her mother. Because Persephone had eaten a single pomegranate seed in the underworld, however, she could not be completely freed but had to remain one-third of the year with Hades, and spent the other two-thirds with her mother. The story that Persephone spent four months of each year in the underworld was no doubt meant to account for the barren appearance of Greek fields in full summer\u2014after harvest, before their revival in the autumn rains, when they are plowed and sown.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Persephone-Greek-goddess\" target=\"_blank\">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>\u00a0</b> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The beauty and sweet smell of the narcissus jonquilla flower were also used to lure Persephone to her capture.</p><blockquote><p>5 \u00a0She [Persephone] was having a good time, along with the daughters of Okeanos, who wear their waistbands slung low. <br/> \u00a0She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets. <br/> \u00a0Up and down the soft meadow. Iris blossoms too she picked, and hyacinth. <br/> \u00a0And the narcissus, which was grown as a lure for the flower-faced girl <br/> \u00a0by Gaia [Earth]. All according to the plans of Zeus. She [Gaia] was doing a favor for the one who receives many guests [H\u0101d\u0113s].</p><p> 10\u00a0 It [the narcissus] was a wondrous thing in its splendor. To look at it gives a sense of holy awe <br/> \u00a0to the immortal gods as well as mortal humans. <br/> \u00a0It has a hundred heads growing from the root up. <br/> \u00a0Its sweet fragrance spread over the wide skies up above. <br/> \u00a0And the earth below smiled back in all its radiance. So too the churning mass of the salty sea. <br/></p><p> 15\u00a0 She [Persephone] was filled with a sense of wonder, and she reached out with both hands <br/><a></a> to take hold of the pretty plaything.<sup><small><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292#fn2\" target=\"_blank\">2</a></small></sup> And the earth, full of roads leading every which way, opened up under her. <br/> \u00a0It happened on the Plain of Nysa. There it was that the Lord who receives many guests made his lunge. <br/> \u00a0He was riding on a chariot drawn by immortal horses. The son of Kronos. The one known by many names. <br/> \u00a0He seized her against her will, put her on his golden chariot,\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>20\u00a0 <b>And drove away as she wept. She cried with a piercing voice, <br/> \u00a0calling upon her father [Zeus], the son of Kronos, the highest and the best. <br/> \u00a0But not one of the immortal ones, or of human mortals, <br/> \u00a0heard her voice.</b> Not even the olive trees which bear their splendid harvest.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292\" target=\"_blank\">Homeric Hymns,\u00a0<i>To Demeter ll.\u00a0</i>5\u201320</a></b><br/></p></blockquote><p>Noticed how Persephone calling out for aid echoes Sansa Sansa doing the same on two occasions. \u00a0And like with Persephone, no one answered her call.</p><p><b></b></p><h2></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><b>So\u00a0she\u00a0wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening,\u00a0calling\u00a0for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince</b>. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised and shaking. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re killing everyone,&rdquo; the steward&rsquo;s daughter had shrieked at her.\u00a0She\u00a0went on and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer,\u00a0she\u00a0said. There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as\u00a0she\u00a0struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other&rsquo;s arms like sisters.<br/></p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Sansa IV</b></p></blockquote>\n<p><br/></p><blockquote><p>That night Sansa dreamed of the riot again. The mob surged around her, shrieking, a maddened beast with a thousand faces. </p><p>Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into monstrous inhuman masks. She wept and told them she had never done them hurt, yet they dragged her from her horse all the same. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;no, please, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; but no one paid her any heed. <b>She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.</b> Women swarmed over her like weasels, pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly, and someone hit her in the face and she felt her teeth shatter. Then she saw the bright glimmer of steel. The knife plunged into her belly and tore and tore and tore, until there was nothing left of her down there but shiny wet ribbons.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Sansa IV</b></p></blockquote><p>I mentioned the abduction of Persephone to show that just as Sansa is symbolically connected to the goddess so too is Jonquil via the fact that George named her after the flower that was used to lure Demeter\u2019s into being captured by Hades.</p><p>Nevertheless, with a name like Jonquil, one must ask why wasn\u2019t that bloom as we know it today the one that the artist used in the black and white drawing. Why did George approve the use of a rose when one was not referenced in the scene with Florian and Jonquil? \u00a0It is quite a curious choice. \u00a0</p><p>Perhaps it was to suggest that the jonquil and the rose were one and the same. Or, maybe it also alludes to the possibility that Jonquil was the original blue winter rose and the female progenitor of the Stark line\u2014a role that like the daughter stolen by Bael the Bard, Sansa will quite likely have to play if the family name is to continue.\u00a0 What do you think?</p><p>The idea of Jonquil as the female forebearer of House Stark is a topic we will revisit in the near future but for now this brings us to the end of part 4. \u00a0In the next chapter, we take a look at Jonquil Darke and the multiple symbolic implications of her name\u2014including what it may mean to arcs of the daughters of House Stark. </p><p><b>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</b></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 2</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181474813231/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",

If he could not have a highborn maiden like a proper knight, he wanted one who at least liked him more than his silver.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote>[[MORE]]<p>Try as I might not to do so, when I write, I tend to repeat phrases a bit too often. \u00a0In fact, I\u2019m pretty confident that I\u2019ve probably done so in this essay series. It\u2019s not deliberate on my part but simply a matter of complacency because I\u2019m not a true writer and so tend to resort to crutch phrases.</p><p>On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that any author as talented as George would mistakenly use the same sentence in back to back chapters and not be aware of it. \u00a0Also, not even a junior editor let alone one who has been at it as long as George\u2019s editor, Anne Groell, would miss that type of mistake by their author. \u00a0And if by some strange chance both the author and editor did miss the mistake, the copyeditor whose job it is to read the manuscript and catch such errors would not.</p><p>However, there are no absolutes in life and while highly unlikely, one cannot say with 100% certainty that it was not a simple mistake. \u00a0I tend to think that if it were, it would have been found by now and corrected in subsequent printings of the book, which has not been the case. \u00a0This suggests that the repetition of the two lines was deliberate on George\u2019s part.</p><p>As the odds are against those involved with the writing and production of the book missing the error, let\u2019s work under the assumption that it was deliberate and speculate on what George might have been trying to highlight by looking at the similarities between the two excerpts.</p><p>In the first passage posted above, Dunk throws Tanselle two coppers in appreciation of her performance during the puppet show. \u00a0One of the coppers he tells her is for last night\u2026meaning the puppet performance, which he also saw the night before. \u00a0However, the throwing of the coins and his use of the phrase, \u201cone for last night\u201d in and of itself has very strong inferences of the paying of a whore. \u00a0</p><p>This is reinforced by his thoughts after Tanselle smiles at him upon receiving the coins. \u00a0He wonders whether the smile is for him or his coins and he thinks back on an event three years past when a drunken Ser Arlan promised to take him to a brothel for his first time with a woman. \u00a0As the old man was drunk, he forgot and by the time he meets Tanselle, Dunk is still a virgin. \u00a0</p><p>The above passage continues with Dunk inviting Tanselle to share a horn of ale. In mythology the horn symbolize male sexuality and in western cultures, sausages are often associated with the male genitals, which makes the words Martin uses overtly sexual.</p><blockquote><p>\"Will you drink a horn of ale?\u201d he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. \u201cWith me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They\u2019re made with pork, I think.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>It makes one wonder what Martin is implying when he says the wine sellers and sausage makers are doing a brisk trade. \u00a0We also shouldn\u2019t forget that as he walked toward the puppeteers, Dunk passed a dancing bear and a bard singing <i>The Bear and the Maiden Fair</i>, which is a highly sexual song. \u00a0This song is also strongly associated with Sansa in the story proper as Butterbumps sings it in its entirety during her interrogation by the Queen of Thorns. \u00a0Now here we see Martin also associating it with Jonquil.</p><p>The wine seller and sausage maker line is repeated in the very next chapter and again it occurs as Dunk approaches the pavilion where the puppeteers are performing the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0Also again it is associated with thoughts of money and a whore as he spies the redheaded one across the way and considers paying for her services. \u00a0He is concerned that she might rob him while he sleeps and so passes on the opportunity.</p><blockquote><p><b>The wine sellers and sausage makers were doing a brisk trade</b>, and whores walked brazenly among the stalls and pavilions. Some were pretty enough, one red-haired girl in particular. He could not help staring at her breasts, the way they moved under her loose shift as she sauntered past. He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She\u2019d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous \u2026 but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the red-haired girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, Dunk shook his head and walked away.</p><p>He found Egg at the puppet show, sitting crosslegged on the ground with the hood of his cloak pulled all the way forward to hide his baldness. </p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>The young knight with the raging hormones watches another performance of the puppet show and has his second conversation with Jonquil afterwards. However, I will be leaving a breakdown of the dialogue from that specific scene for when I discuss Florian and Jonquil as a couple.</p><p>Both passages of course talk about the heavy business occurring at the booths of the wine sellers and sausage makers and takes place right before Dunk\u2019s interaction with Tanselle and exposition on the story of Florian and Jonquill via the puppet shows. \u00a0The two passages also include an overt amount of sexual dialogue and thoughts on Dunk\u2019s part\u2026particularly regarding whores.</p><p>Why this striking association of whores in the Florian and Jonquil story? \u00a0It\u2019s not just the scenes with Dunk but also how Martin uses Dancy the whore at Chatya\u2019s establishment in Kings Landing to possibly hint at Jonquil. \u00a0And Sansa is of course currently under the control of Petyr, a brothel owner. \u00a0She has not been forced into prostitution but her best friend Jeyne was not so lucky. \u00a0In addition to prostitution, Jeyne has been forced to marry Ramsay Bolton as an Arya stand-in.\u00a0 It\u2019s also not just Sansa and Jeyne as in the Mercy preview chapter from TWOW, Arya plays the part of a lady of the evening in her quest to cross a name off her list.</p><p>I have to say that I was stumped when I discovered this connection to whores in the sister\u2019s storyline until a possible explanation came to me about what Martin maybe symbolically implying. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s possible that one of the reasons we get so many references to whores in the story is that as he is using Jon as the symbolic Last Hero/Christ like figure in the story who will return from the dead to be the savior of mankind, Jonquil/Sansa may represents his Mary Magdalene counterpart. </p><p>Like with the tale of Christ\u2019s resurrection, there are many different versions to the biblical myths surrounding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Magdalene</a>\u2014including the earlier belief that she was a repentant prostitute. She is often conflated with <a href=\"https://en.wikip\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Bethany</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7:36%E2%80%9350&amp;version=NRSV\" target=\"_blank\">sinful woman</a> who washed Christ\u2019s feet as referenced in the Gospel of Luke. \u00a0And there are some biblical scholars who believe that there was some type of romantic relationship between Christ and Mary. </p><p>Another woman of whom Mary Magdalene is confused is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Egypt\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Egypt</a>, the prostitute who later became a saint. \u00a0In fact, in some Medieval paintings, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Egypt are rendered in similar manner with a skull to signify their penitence, which no doubt contributed to the confusion between the two.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"753\" data-orig-height=\"477\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab7d4aed5ae22e300775b9346612c074/tumblr_inline_pkxn5ukBgN1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"753\" data-orig-height=\"477\"></figure><blockquote><p>(Left) Mary Magdalene with the Smoking Flame by\u00a0Georges de La Tour [Public domain], courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Georges_de_La_Tour_-_Magdalen_of_Night_Light_-_WGA12337.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>; (Right) Mary of Egypt by\u00a0Jusepe de Ribera [Public domain] courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:S._Maria_Egiziaca_by_Jusepe_de_Ribera.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>Now before anyone starts wondering if I am saying that Jonquil was a prostitute, the answer is no. \u00a0I don\u2019t believe that was the case. \u00a0I am talking about George adding texture to the story. \u00a0It is part of his world building. \u00a0He is playing with the mythological story of Christ throughout his story as the savior of man. \u00a0This includes the Last Hero and his 12 Apostle like companions and now Jon and his future Christ like return from the dead. </p><p>The show had Jon going beyond the Wall with 12 companions on the wight hunt and it\u2019s possible that something similar will happen in the books as well. \u00a0I don\u2019t expect something as stupid as a wight hunt but I think that we can all agree that the Wall will fall. \u00a0And as others before me have speculated, I can see Jon and 12 companions heading further north for a final showdown with the Others that would in some way mirror the events with the Last Hero. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Mary Magdalene like the 12 disciples is a major part of the Christian myth about the Christ and a big part of her legend is the belief by some that she was a prostitute. \u00a0It is this belief that I think Martin maybe playing with to add texture to his story. \u00a0</p><p>This does not mean Jonquil was a whore as Mary Magdalene most likely was not one. \u00a0It simply means that Martin is possibly playing with the idea of this part of her myth. \u00a0He has played with it in other ways in the text. There is actually a scene with Jon in ACOK, which I\u2019ve discussed in a previous essay series that echoes the resurrection of the Christ and Mary Magdalene being the first one to discover his return.</p><blockquote><p>He woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air. When he moved, his bones ached. Ghost was gone, the fire burnt out. <b>Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he\u2019d hung over the rock, and found it stiff and frozen</b>. \u00a0He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal.</p><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every blade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond. \u00a0Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen . Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice.</p><p><i>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all</i>. \u00a0He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he\u2019d dreamed of them last night. \u00a0Sansa would call this an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but Arya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all.</p><p>\u201c<i>Lord Snow</i>?\u201d he heard. Soft and meek. He turned.</p><p><b>Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper</b>, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her. Sam\u2019s cloak, Jon realized at once. Why is she wearing Sam\u2019s cloak? \u201cThe fat one told me I\u2019d find you here, m'lord,\u201d she said.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>In the scene above, Jon\u2019s little sleeping chamber that he created by hanging his cloak at the opening to protect him from the elements represents is the symbolic tomb of Christ. \u00a0And when he pulls it aside to crawl out, he is symbolically rolling back the rock that sealed Christ\u2019s tomb. \u00a0His black brothers or symbolic disciples are still asleep and so are not aware that he has arisen. \u00a0His cold breath and aching bones also signify that he has come back from the other side where he was symbolically frozen in death. \u00a0It also hints at his future death and the vision Bran saw of him in the ice cave as his body lost all warmth.</p><p>Gilly symbolically plays two roles in the scene. \u00a0With her wearing Sam\u2019s cloak, she is symbolically his wife, which hints at their future relationship. \u00a0However, as the only person there when Jon exits his symbolic tomb, she also takes on the role of Mary Magdalene.</p><p>There are different versions of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ in the various gospels but the common denominator in all is the presence Mary Magdalene at his death, burial and as one of the first witnesses of his empty tomb.</p><p>In some telling of the story, Mary is one of the three women who discover the stone removed from the tomb of Christ. \u00a0They enter to find the body gone and the presence of an angel who tells them that Christ has risen and they should go and spread the word to his disciples. In two other gospels they don\u2019t enter the tomb but an angel rolls away the rock and tells them that Christ has risen. \u00a0Jesus then appears to them and tells them to go and notify the disciples that he has risen and to meet him in Galilee. \u00a0And in the Gospel of John, Mary goes to the tomb alone and it is there that the Christ appears to her.</p><blockquote><p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:1\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:1\u201310</a>, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb alone when it was still dark and saw that the stone had already been rolled away. \u00a0She did not see anyone, but immediately ran to tell Peter and the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved\" target=\"_blank\">beloved disciple</a>,\u201d who came with her to the tomb and confirmed that it was empty but returned home without seeing the risen Jesus. \u00a0According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:11\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:11\u201318</a>, Mary, now alone in the garden outside the tomb, saw two angels sitting where Jesus\u2019s body had been. \u00a0Then the risen Jesus approached her. \u00a0She at first mistook him for the gardener, but, after she heard him say her name, she recognized him and cried out \u201cRabbouni!\u201d (which is Aramaic for \u201cteacher\"). \u00a0She tried to touch him, but he told her, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my father.\u201d \u00a0Jesus then sent her to tell the other apostles the good news of his resurrection. \u00a0The Gospel of John therefore portrays Mary Magdalene as the first apostle, the apostle sent <i>to</i> the apostles.</p><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a></p></blockquote><p>Jon thinks that there is magic beyond the Wall. \u00a0In the story, life beyond the Wall denotes another life for the people of Westeros. \u00a0It\u2019s the symbolic \u201cother side.\u201d \u00a0And so Jon\u2019s viewing it as magical can be said to tie into the Christian belief of a second life.</p><p>Arya and Sansa enter his thoughts when he sees the crystallization of the forests. \u00a0His thoughts of them figuratively add two additional women to the scene and with Gilly\u2019s literal presence there are symbolically three women there at his return, which plays into the other biblical myths of three women being present at the return of the Christ.</p><p>In my essay, <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/172429311701/waking-in-a-winter-wonderland-an-analys\" target=\"_blank\">Waking in a Winter Wonderland</a><i>,</i> I argued that Sansa\u2019s snowy garden scene in the Eyrie was a symbolic continuation of the icy Jon one from the haunted forest posted above. \u00a0I have also argued that there are strong clues in Sansa\u2019s scene that suggest Jon will be in the Vale. \u00a0Now after reading the biblical verse where the risen Christ approaches Mary Magdalene\u2026most likely as dawn was breaking, I feel even more strongly that I\u2019m on to something.</p><blockquote><p><b>Dawn stole into her garden like a thief.</b> The grey of the sky grew lighter still, and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath <b>their stoles of snow</b>.</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Sansa VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Christ was the sun/son who brought the dawn and hope for mankind with his return from the dead. \u00a0In the story told in the central books of the series, Jon is the symbolic sun/son and with him comes the dawn. \u00a0When he first appeared to her, Mary Magdalene thought Christ was the gardener arriving for work, which suggest that his tomb was located in a garden. \u00a0 As she was alone there in the morning, it was symbolically her garden he entered. \u00a0And just as dawn in the form of Christ entered Mary Magdalene\u2019s garden, it also steals into Sansa\u2019s but in her case, the bringer of dawn is symbolically Jon.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>FLORIAN AND JONQUIL, AND THE BLUE WINTER ROSE</b></p><p>This next section was previously published as a preview of this essay series. \u00a0You can find the article <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/178966949166/florian-and-jonquil-jon-and-sansa-and-the-blue\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>The Dunk and Egg novellas are some of the most enjoyable stories of the entire series and I highly recommend reading them. \u00a0Recently, as I sat on the train during the evening commute, getting lost again in their adventures, one of my theories jumped out at me from one of the drawings in <i>The Hedge Knight</i>.</p><p>If you have read my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/166683154156/of-sansa-stark-the-glass-menagerie-the-rose-of-sharon-jo\" target=\"_blank\">Of Stark and the Glass Menagerie</a> essay, you are aware of my theory that the famous Blue Winter Rose is actually the jonquil flower. \u00a0There are several reasons for this theory not the least being that the modern rose is a cultivated flower that did not exist during medieval or more ancient times. \u00a0However, the jonquil flower did and it was considered by many to be a wild rose. \u00a0In fact many scholars believe that the narcissus-jonquilla is actually the Rose of Sharon flower referenced in the famous biblical poem, <i>Song of Solomon</i>.</p><blockquote><p>Female</p><p>I am the rose of Sharon,<br>\nand the lily of the valleys. <br></p><p>Male</p><p>As the lily among thorns,<br>\nso is my love among the daughters. </p></blockquote><p>It is my theory that while the blue winter rose Dany saw in the chink in the wall tips to Lyanna as Jon\u2019s mother, in the story proper, it is more indicative of Sansa Stark, her importance to the story; connection to Jon Snow; and their future relationship.</p><p>I think that hints of this relationship is there in many of the ancient tales because just as George uses the story proper to provide clues to the stories of the past, he also uses the tales and songs of times past as hints to the current story. One such ancient tale that I think Martin uses to strongly denote things to come in the books are the story about Florian and Jonquil. </p><p>And so, there I was sitting on the train, getting lost in the adventures of Dunk and Egg when suddenly a drawing of Florian and Jonquil jump out at me. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen this drawing a million times and yet there is something about the image that I never noticed until that night. \u00a0</p><p>Those of you familiar with the Dunk and Egg stories will know that black and white line drawings are included throughout. \u00a0These drawings showcase various scenes from the books and are pretty exact representation of the scene described. \u00a0Here is one from Egg\u2019s confrontation with his older brother Aerion Brightflame.</p><p>The hands holding his left arm were gone, and then the others. Dunk did not understand what was happening. The men-at-arms were backing away. One even knelt. Then the crowd parted for Raymun Fossoway. He had donned mail and helm, and his hand was on his sword. His cousin Ser Steffon, just behind him, had already bared his blade, and with them were a half-dozen men-at-arms with the red apple badge sewn on their breasts.</p><p>Prince Aerion paid them no mind. \"Impudent little wretch,\u201d he said to Egg, spitting a mouthful of blood at the boy\u2019s feet. \u201cWhat happened to your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut it off, brother,\u201d said Egg. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like you.\u201d</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1235\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cde62a095830ab91c944fc3000ade4/tumblr_inline_pkxcd8w5aj1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1235\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"></figure><p>Noticed that even the spittle from Aerion is included in the drawing. \u00a0I mention all this and showed the image with Egg to demonstrate how detail the drawings are in rendering the scene described.</p><p>I am pretty confident that as is most likely the case with any official image associated with ASOIAF, George approved all drawings used in the Dunk and Egg novella in advance of publication of the books. \u00a0This is why I find the Florian and Jonquil image to be very curious in nature. \u00a0During the puppet show, Florian is described as kneeling to Jonquil and here is the scene shown in the drawing. I want you to look closely because there is something very interesting about the scene in question.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcfae98de22e2e880390985e6affe4f2/tumblr_inline_pkxckbf2GA1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\"></figure><p>Did you see it? \u00a0</p><p>If not, look again at the lower right hand corner at what is laying on the ground in the scene. \u00a0It\u2019s none other than a rose! \u00a0Now believe me when I tell you that at no point during the puppet show and Dunk\u2019s thoughts are there ever a mention of a rose. And yet, there is one shown in the drawing.\u00a0 This is not to say that the word rose is never mentioned in the text.\u00a0 Leo Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden at the time is present and and so the word is used in relation to him.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it is never once used to refer to either Jonquil or Tanselle and yet one is shown in the illustration.\u00a0</p><p>Now the drawings are in black and white and so there is no color assigned to the rose in the image.\u00a0 However, as Jonquil is so closely associated with Sansa Stark who is a symbolic blue winter rose, I would harbor a guess that the reader is meant to see the rose on the floor as a blue rose.\u00a0 To me, this strongly indicates that the blue rose connects to the story of Florian and Jonquil and so the question then becomes why?</p><p>There are two iconic flowers in the story and they both connect to the daughters of House Stark. \u00a0When I refer to the jonquil as an iconic flower in the story it is not to say that the physical flower appears in the tale\u2014at least not yet. \u00a0However, it does appear symbolically in the form of Sansa, the eldest daughter of House Stark. \u00a0My question to you is what do you think the odds are that both flowers strongly associated with the daughter of the most important family in the story are two totally different sweet smelling blooms? \u00a0I say it\u2019s little to none.</p><p>The physical jonquil flower may not have appeared in the story proper but it may in the future when we learn more about the fair maiden who bore its name.\u00a0 And it would not matter if it doesn\u2019t make an appearance because ultimately it\u2019s about the symbolism and it is very present in Sansa\u2019s arc.\u00a0 Jonquil in a way was the symbolic Rose of Sharon.\u00a0 She was the lily of the valley or vale as it were since the two words are synonyms of each other.</p><p>As I also discussed in my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/171001805336/speaker-of-the-dead-or-do-direwolves-dream-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Do Direwolves Dream of the Weirwood Net</a> essay, Persephone was kidnapped while picking jonquils from the Vale of Nysa, a mountainous valley very like the Vale of Arryn in the books.</p><blockquote><p>In the Homeric \u201c<a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292\" target=\"_blank\">Hymn to Demeter</a>,\u201d the story is told of how <b>Persephone was gathering flowers in the Vale of Nysa</b> when she was seized by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hades-Greek-mythology\" target=\"_blank\">Hades</a> and removed to the underworld. Upon learning of the abduction, her mother, Demeter, in her misery, became unconcerned with the harvest or the fruitfulness of the earth, so that widespread famine ensued. Zeus therefore intervened, commanding Hades to release Persephone to her mother. Because Persephone had eaten a single pomegranate seed in the underworld, however, she could not be completely freed but had to remain one-third of the year with Hades, and spent the other two-thirds with her mother. The story that Persephone spent four months of each year in the underworld was no doubt meant to account for the barren appearance of Greek fields in full summer\u2014after harvest, before their revival in the autumn rains, when they are plowed and sown.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Persephone-Greek-goddess\" target=\"_blank\">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>\u00a0</b> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The beauty and sweet smell of the narcissus jonquilla flower were also used to lure Persephone to her capture.</p><blockquote><p>5 \u00a0She [Persephone] was having a good time, along with the daughters of Okeanos, who wear their waistbands slung low. <br> \u00a0She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets. <br> \u00a0Up and down the soft meadow.

Why did George approve the use of a rose when one was not referenced in the scene with Florian and Jonquil? \u00a0It is quite a curious choice. \u00a0</p><p>Perhaps it was to suggest that the jonquil and the rose were one and the same. Or, maybe it also alludes to the possibility that Jonquil was the original blue winter rose and the female progenitor of the Stark line\u2014a role that like the daughter stolen by Bael the Bard, Sansa will quite likely have to play if the family name is to continue.\u00a0 What do you think?</p><p>The idea of Jonquil as the female forebearer of House Stark is a topic we will revisit in the near future but for now this brings us to the end of part 4. \u00a0In the next chapter, we take a look at Jonquil Darke and the multiple symbolic implications of her name\u2014including what it may mean to arcs of the daughters of House Stark. </p><p><b>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</b></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 2</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181474813231/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",

When the puppet knight cut its head off and the red sawdust spilled out onto the grass, he laughed aloud and threw the girl two coppers. \u201cOne for last night,\u201d he called. She caught the coins in the air and threw him back a smile as sweet as any he had ever seen. \u00a0Is it me she smiles at, or the coins? Dunk had never been with a girl, and they made him nervous. Once, three years past, when the old man\u2019s purse was full after half a year in the service of blind Lord Florent, he\u2019d told Dunk the time had come to take him to a brothel and make him a man. He\u2019d been drunk, though, and when he was sober he did not remember. Dunk had been too embarrassed to remind him.</p><p>He was not certain he wanted a whore anyway. If he could not have a highborn maiden like a proper knight, he wanted one who at least liked him more than his silver.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote>[[MORE]]<p>Try as I might not to do so, when I write, I tend to repeat phrases a bit too often. \u00a0In fact, I\u2019m pretty confident that I\u2019ve probably done so in this essay series. It\u2019s not deliberate on my part but simply a matter of complacency because I\u2019m not a true writer and so tend to resort to crutch phrases.</p><p>On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that any author as talented as George would mistakenly use the same sentence in back to back chapters and not be aware of it. \u00a0Also, not even a junior editor let alone one who has been at it as long as George\u2019s editor, Anne Groell, would miss that type of mistake by their author. \u00a0And if by some strange chance both the author and editor did miss the mistake, the copyeditor whose job it is to read the manuscript and catch such errors would not.</p><p>However, there are no absolutes in life and while highly unlikely, one cannot say with 100% certainty that it was not a simple mistake. \u00a0I tend to think that if it were, it would have been found by now and corrected in subsequent printings of the book, which has not been the case. \u00a0This suggests that the repetition of the two lines was deliberate on George\u2019s part.</p><p>As the odds are against those involved with the writing and production of the book missing the error, let\u2019s work under the assumption that it was deliberate and speculate on what George might have been trying to highlight by looking at the similarities between the two excerpts.</p><p>In the first passage posted above, Dunk throws Tanselle two coppers in appreciation of her performance during the puppet show. \u00a0One of the coppers he tells her is for last night\u2026meaning the puppet performance, which he also saw the night before. \u00a0However, the throwing of the coins and his use of the phrase, \u201cone for last night\u201d in and of itself has very strong inferences of the paying of a whore. \u00a0</p><p>This is reinforced by his thoughts after Tanselle smiles at him upon receiving the coins. \u00a0He wonders whether the smile is for him or his coins and he thinks back on an event three years past when a drunken Ser Arlan promised to take him to a brothel for his first time with a woman. \u00a0As the old man was drunk, he forgot and by the time he meets Tanselle, Dunk is still a virgin. \u00a0</p><p>The above passage continues with Dunk inviting Tanselle to share a horn of ale. In mythology the horn symbolize male sexuality and in western cultures, sausages are often associated with the male genitals, which makes the words Martin uses overtly sexual.</p><blockquote><p>\"Will you drink a horn of ale?\u201d he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. \u201cWith me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They\u2019re made with pork, I think.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>It makes one wonder what Martin is implying when he says the wine sellers and sausage makers are doing a brisk trade. \u00a0We also shouldn\u2019t forget that as he walked toward the puppeteers, Dunk passed a dancing bear and a bard singing <i>The Bear and the Maiden Fair</i>, which is a highly sexual song. \u00a0This song is also strongly associated with Sansa in the story proper as Butterbumps sings it in its entirety during her interrogation by the Queen of Thorns. \u00a0Now here we see Martin also associating it with Jonquil.</p><p>The wine seller and sausage maker line is repeated in the very next chapter and again it occurs as Dunk approaches the pavilion where the puppeteers are performing the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0Also again it is associated with thoughts of money and a whore as he spies the redheaded one across the way and considers paying for her services. \u00a0He is concerned that she might rob him while he sleeps and so passes on the opportunity.</p><blockquote><p><b>The wine sellers and sausage makers were doing a brisk trade</b>, and whores walked brazenly among the stalls and pavilions. Some were pretty enough, one red-haired girl in particular. He could not help staring at her breasts, the way they moved under her loose shift as she sauntered past. He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She\u2019d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous \u2026 but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the red-haired girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, Dunk shook his head and walked away.</p><p>He found Egg at the puppet show, sitting crosslegged on the ground with the hood of his cloak pulled all the way forward to hide his baldness. </p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>The young knight with the raging hormones watches another performance of the puppet show and has his second conversation with Jonquil afterwards. However, I will be leaving a breakdown of the dialogue from that specific scene for when I discuss Florian and Jonquil as a couple.</p><p>Both passages of course talk about the heavy business occurring at the booths of the wine sellers and sausage makers and takes place right before Dunk\u2019s interaction with Tanselle and exposition on the story of Florian and Jonquill via the puppet shows. \u00a0The two passages also include an overt amount of sexual dialogue and thoughts on Dunk\u2019s part\u2026particularly regarding whores.</p><p>Why this striking association of whores in the Florian and Jonquil story? \u00a0It\u2019s not just the scenes with Dunk but also how Martin uses Dancy the whore at Chatya\u2019s establishment in Kings Landing to possibly hint at Jonquil. \u00a0And Sansa is of course currently under the control of Petyr, a brothel owner. \u00a0She has not been forced into prostitution but her best friend Jeyne was not so lucky. \u00a0In addition to prostitution, Jeyne has been forced to marry Ramsay Bolton as an Arya stand-in.\u00a0 It\u2019s also not just Sansa and Jeyne as in the Mercy preview chapter from TWOW, Arya plays the part of a lady of the evening in her quest to cross a name off her list.</p><p>I have to say that I was stumped when I discovered this connection to whores in the sister\u2019s storyline until a possible explanation came to me about what Martin maybe symbolically implying. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s possible that one of the reasons we get so many references to whores in the story is that as he is using Jon as the symbolic Last Hero/Christ like figure in the story who will return from the dead to be the savior of mankind, Jonquil/Sansa may represents his Mary Magdalene counterpart. </p><p>Like with the tale of Christ\u2019s resurrection, there are many different versions to the biblical myths surrounding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Magdalene</a>\u2014including the earlier belief that she was a repentant prostitute. She is often conflated with <a href=\"https://en.wikip\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Bethany</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7:36%E2%80%9350&amp;version=NRSV\" target=\"_blank\">sinful woman</a> who washed Christ\u2019s feet as referenced in the Gospel of Luke. \u00a0And there are some biblical scholars who believe that there was some type of romantic relationship between Christ and Mary. </p><p>Another woman of whom Mary Magdalene is confused is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Egypt\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Egypt</a>, the prostitute who later became a saint. \u00a0In fact, in some Medieval paintings, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Egypt are rendered in similar manner with a skull to signify their penitence, which no doubt contributed to the confusion between the two.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"753\" data-orig-height=\"477\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab7d4aed5ae22e300775b9346612c074/tumblr_inline_pkxn5ukBgN1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"753\" data-orig-height=\"477\"></figure><blockquote><p>(Left) Mary Magdalene with the Smoking Flame by\u00a0Georges de La Tour [Public domain], courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Georges_de_La_Tour_-_Magdalen_of_Night_Light_-_WGA12337.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>; (Right) Mary of Egypt by\u00a0Jusepe de Ribera [Public domain] courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:S._Maria_Egiziaca_by_Jusepe_de_Ribera.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>Now before anyone starts wondering if I am saying that Jonquil was a prostitute, the answer is no. \u00a0I don\u2019t believe that was the case. \u00a0I am talking about George adding texture to the story. \u00a0It is part of his world building. \u00a0He is playing with the mythological story of Christ throughout his story as the savior of man. \u00a0This includes the Last Hero and his 12 Apostle like companions and now Jon and his future Christ like return from the dead. </p><p>The show had Jon going beyond the Wall with 12 companions on the wight hunt and it\u2019s possible that something similar will happen in the books as well. \u00a0I don\u2019t expect something as stupid as a wight hunt but I think that we can all agree that the Wall will fall. \u00a0And as others before me have speculated, I can see Jon and 12 companions heading further north for a final showdown with the Others that would in some way mirror the events with the Last Hero. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Mary Magdalene like the 12 disciples is a major part of the Christian myth about the Christ and a big part of her legend is the belief by some that she was a prostitute. \u00a0It is this belief that I think Martin maybe playing with to add texture to his story. \u00a0</p><p>This does not mean Jonquil was a whore as Mary Magdalene most likely was not one. \u00a0It simply means that Martin is possibly playing with the idea of this part of her myth. \u00a0He has played with it in other ways in the text. There is actually a scene with Jon in ACOK, which I\u2019ve discussed in a previous essay series that echoes the resurrection of the Christ and Mary Magdalene being the first one to discover his return.</p><blockquote><p>He woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air. When he moved, his bones ached. Ghost was gone, the fire burnt out. <b>Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he\u2019d hung over the rock, and found it stiff and frozen</b>. \u00a0He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal.</p><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every blade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond. \u00a0Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen . Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice.</p><p><i>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all</i>. \u00a0He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he\u2019d dreamed of them last night. \u00a0Sansa would call this an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but Arya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all.</p><p>\u201c<i>Lord Snow</i>?\u201d he heard. Soft and meek. He turned.</p><p><b>Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper</b>, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her. Sam\u2019s cloak, Jon realized at once. Why is she wearing Sam\u2019s cloak? \u201cThe fat one told me I\u2019d find you here, m'lord,\u201d she said.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>In the scene above, Jon\u2019s little sleeping chamber that he created by hanging his cloak at the opening to protect him from the elements represents is the symbolic tomb of Christ. \u00a0And when he pulls it aside to crawl out, he is symbolically rolling back the rock that sealed Christ\u2019s tomb. \u00a0His black brothers or symbolic disciples are still asleep and so are not aware that he has arisen. \u00a0His cold breath and aching bones also signify that he has come back from the other side where he was symbolically frozen in death. \u00a0It also hints at his future death and the vision Bran saw of him in the ice cave as his body lost all warmth.</p><p>Gilly symbolically plays two roles in the scene. \u00a0With her wearing Sam\u2019s cloak, she is symbolically his wife, which hints at their future relationship. \u00a0However, as the only person there when Jon exits his symbolic tomb, she also takes on the role of Mary Magdalene.</p><p>There are different versions of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ in the various gospels but the common denominator in all is the presence Mary Magdalene at his death, burial and as one of the first witnesses of his empty tomb.</p><p>In some telling of the story, Mary is one of the three women who discover the stone removed from the tomb of Christ. \u00a0They enter to find the body gone and the presence of an angel who tells them that Christ has risen and they should go and spread the word to his disciples. In two other gospels they don\u2019t enter the tomb but an angel rolls away the rock and tells them that Christ has risen. \u00a0Jesus then appears to them and tells them to go and notify the disciples that he has risen and to meet him in Galilee. \u00a0And in the Gospel of John, Mary goes to the tomb alone and it is there that the Christ appears to her.</p><blockquote><p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:1\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:1\u201310</a>, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb alone when it was still dark and saw that the stone had already been rolled away. \u00a0She did not see anyone, but immediately ran to tell Peter and the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved\" target=\"_blank\">beloved disciple</a>,\u201d who came with her to the tomb and confirmed that it was empty but returned home without seeing the risen Jesus. \u00a0According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:11\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:11\u201318</a>, Mary, now alone in the garden outside the tomb, saw two angels sitting where Jesus\u2019s body had been. \u00a0Then the risen Jesus approached her. \u00a0She at first mistook him for the gardener, but, after she heard him say her name, she recognized him and cried out \u201cRabbouni!\u201d (which is Aramaic for \u201cteacher\"). \u00a0She tried to touch him, but he told her, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my father.\u201d \u00a0Jesus then sent her to tell the other apostles the good news of his resurrection. \u00a0The Gospel of John therefore portrays Mary Magdalene as the first apostle, the apostle sent <i>to</i> the apostles.</p><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a></p></blockquote><p>Jon thinks that there is magic beyond the Wall. \u00a0In the story, life beyond the Wall denotes another life for the people of Westeros. \u00a0It\u2019s the symbolic \u201cother side.\u201d \u00a0And so Jon\u2019s viewing it as magical can be said to tie into the Christian belief of a second life.</p><p>Arya and Sansa enter his thoughts when he sees the crystallization of the forests. \u00a0His thoughts of them figuratively add two additional women to the scene and with Gilly\u2019s literal presence there are symbolically three women there at his return, which plays into the other biblical myths of three women being present at the return of the Christ.</p><p>In my essay, <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/172429311701/waking-in-a-winter-wonderland-an-analys\" target=\"_blank\">Waking in a Winter Wonderland</a><i>,</i> I argued that Sansa\u2019s snowy garden scene in the Eyrie was a symbolic continuation of the icy Jon one from the haunted forest posted above. \u00a0I have also argued that there are strong clues in Sansa\u2019s scene that suggest Jon will be in the Vale. \u00a0Now after reading the biblical verse where the risen Christ approaches Mary Magdalene\u2026most likely as dawn was breaking, I feel even more strongly that I\u2019m on to something.</p><blockquote><p><b>Dawn stole into her garden like a thief.</b> The grey of the sky grew lighter still, and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath <b>their stoles of snow</b>.</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Sansa VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Christ was the sun/son who brought the dawn and hope for mankind with his return from the dead. \u00a0In the story told in the central books of the series, Jon is the symbolic sun/son and with him comes the dawn. \u00a0When he first appeared to her, Mary Magdalene thought Christ was the gardener arriving for work, which suggest that his tomb was located in a garden. \u00a0 As she was alone there in the morning, it was symbolically her garden he entered. \u00a0And just as dawn in the form of Christ entered Mary Magdalene\u2019s garden, it also steals into Sansa\u2019s but in her case, the bringer of dawn is symbolically Jon.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>FLORIAN AND JONQUIL, AND THE BLUE WINTER ROSE</b></p><p>This next section was previously published as a preview of this essay series. \u00a0You can find the article <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/178966949166/florian-and-jonquil-jon-and-sansa-and-the-blue\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>The Dunk and Egg novellas are some of the most enjoyable stories of the entire series and I highly recommend reading them. \u00a0Recently, as I sat on the train during the evening commute, getting lost again in their adventures, one of my theories jumped out at me from one of the drawings in <i>The Hedge Knight</i>.</p><p>If you have read my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/166683154156/of-sansa-stark-the-glass-menagerie-the-rose-of-sharon-jo\" target=\"_blank\">Of Stark and the Glass Menagerie</a> essay, you are aware of my theory that the famous Blue Winter Rose is actually the jonquil flower. \u00a0There are several reasons for this theory not the least being that the modern rose is a cultivated flower that did not exist during medieval or more ancient times. \u00a0However, the jonquil flower did and it was considered by many to be a wild rose. \u00a0In fact many scholars believe that the narcissus-jonquilla is actually the Rose of Sharon flower referenced in the famous biblical poem, <i>Song of Solomon</i>.</p><blockquote><p>Female</p><p>I am the rose of Sharon,<br>\nand the lily of the valleys. <br></p><p>Male</p><p>As the lily among thorns,<br>\nso is my love among the daughters. </p></blockquote><p>It is my theory that while the blue winter rose Dany saw in the chink in the wall tips to Lyanna as Jon\u2019s mother, in the story proper, it is more indicative of Sansa Stark, her importance to the story; connection to Jon Snow; and their future relationship.</p><p>I think that hints of this relationship is there in many of the ancient tales because just as George uses the story proper to provide clues to the stories of the past, he also uses the tales and songs of times past as hints to the current story. One such ancient tale that I think Martin uses to strongly denote things to come in the books are the story about Florian and Jonquil. </p><p>And so, there I was sitting on the train, getting lost in the adventures of Dunk and Egg when suddenly a drawing of Florian and Jonquil jump out at me. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen this drawing a million times and yet there is something about the image that I never noticed until that night. \u00a0</p><p>Those of you familiar with the Dunk and Egg stories will know that black and white line drawings are included throughout. \u00a0These drawings showcase various scenes from the books and are pretty exact representation of the scene described. \u00a0Here is one from Egg\u2019s confrontation with his older brother Aerion Brightflame.</p><p>The hands holding his left arm were gone, and then the others. Dunk did not understand what was happening. The men-at-arms were backing away. One even knelt. Then the crowd parted for Raymun Fossoway. He had donned mail and helm, and his hand was on his sword. His cousin Ser Steffon, just behind him, had already bared his blade, and with them were a half-dozen men-at-arms with the red apple badge sewn on their breasts.</p><p>Prince Aerion paid them no mind. \"Impudent little wretch,\u201d he said to Egg, spitting a mouthful of blood at the boy\u2019s feet. \u201cWhat happened to your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut it off, brother,\u201d said Egg. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like you.\u201d</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1235\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cde62a095830ab91c944fc3000ade4/tumblr_inline_pkxcd8w5aj1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1235\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"></figure><p>Noticed that even the spittle from Aerion is included in the drawing. \u00a0I mention all this and showed the image with Egg to demonstrate how detail the drawings are in rendering the scene described.</p><p>I am pretty confident that as is most likely the case with any official image associated with ASOIAF, George approved all drawings used in the Dunk and Egg novella in advance of publication of the books. \u00a0This is why I find the Florian and Jonquil image to be very curious in nature. \u00a0During the puppet show, Florian is described as kneeling to Jonquil and here is the scene shown in the drawing. I want you to look closely because there is something very interesting about the scene in question.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcfae98de22e2e880390985e6affe4f2/tumblr_inline_pkxckbf2GA1scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1171\" data-orig-height=\"940\"></figure><p>Did you see it? \u00a0</p><p>If not, look again at the lower right hand corner at what is laying on the ground in the scene. \u00a0It\u2019s none other than a rose! \u00a0Now believe me when I tell you that at no point during the puppet show and Dunk\u2019s thoughts are there ever a mention of a rose. And yet, there is one shown in the drawing.\u00a0 This is not to say that the word rose is never mentioned in the text.\u00a0 Leo Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden at the time is present and and so the word is used in relation to him.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it is never once used to refer to either Jonquil or Tanselle and yet one is shown in the illustration.\u00a0</p><p>Now the drawings are in black and white and so there is no color assigned to the rose in the image.\u00a0 However, as Jonquil is so closely associated with Sansa Stark who is a symbolic blue winter rose, I would harbor a guess that the reader is meant to see the rose on the floor as a blue rose.\u00a0 To me, this strongly indicates that the blue rose connects to the story of Florian and Jonquil and so the question then becomes why?</p><p>There are two iconic flowers in the story and they both connect to the daughters of House Stark. \u00a0When I refer to the jonquil as an iconic flower in the story it is not to say that the physical flower appears in the tale\u2014at least not yet. \u00a0However, it does appear symbolically in the form of Sansa, the eldest daughter of House Stark. \u00a0My question to you is what do you think the odds are that both flowers strongly associated with the daughter of the most important family in the story are two totally different sweet smelling blooms? \u00a0I say it\u2019s little to none.</p><p>The physical jonquil flower may not have appeared in the story proper but it may in the future when we learn more about the fair maiden who bore its name.\u00a0 And it would not matter if it doesn\u2019t make an appearance because ultimately it\u2019s about the symbolism and it is very present in Sansa\u2019s arc.\u00a0 Jonquil in a way was the symbolic Rose of Sharon.\u00a0 She was the lily of the valley or vale as it were since the two words are synonyms of each other.</p><p>As I also discussed in my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/171001805336/speaker-of-the-dead-or-do-direwolves-dream-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Do Direwolves Dream of the Weirwood Net</a> essay, Persephone was kidnapped while picking jonquils from the Vale of Nysa, a mountainous valley very like the Vale of Arryn in the books.</p><blockquote><p>In the Homeric \u201c<a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292\" target=\"_blank\">Hymn to Demeter</a>,\u201d the story is told of how <b>Persephone was gathering flowers in the Vale of Nysa</b> when she was seized by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hades-Greek-mythology\" target=\"_blank\">Hades</a> and removed to the underworld. Upon learning of the abduction, her mother, Demeter, in her misery, became unconcerned with the harvest or the fruitfulness of the earth, so that widespread famine ensued. Zeus therefore intervened, commanding Hades to release Persephone to her mother. Because Persephone had eaten a single pomegranate seed in the underworld, however, she could not be completely freed but had to remain one-third of the year with Hades, and spent the other two-thirds with her mother. The story that Persephone spent four months of each year in the underworld was no doubt meant to account for the barren appearance of Greek fields in full summer\u2014after harvest, before their revival in the autumn rains, when they are plowed and sown.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Persephone-Greek-goddess\" target=\"_blank\">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>\u00a0</b> \u00a0</p></blockquote><p>The beauty and sweet smell of the narcissus jonquilla flower were also used to lure Persephone to her capture.</p><blockquote><p>5 \u00a0She [Persephone] was having a good time, along with the daughters of Okeanos, who wear their waistbands slung low. <br> \u00a0She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets. <br> \u00a0Up and down the soft meadow. Iris blossoms too she picked, and hyacinth. <br> \u00a0And the narcissus, which was grown as a lure for the flower-faced girl <br> \u00a0by Gaia [Earth]. All according to the plans of Zeus. She [Gaia] was doing a favor for the one who receives many guests [H\u0101d\u0113s].</p><p> 10\u00a0 It [the narcissus] was a wondrous thing in its splendor. To look at it gives a sense of holy awe <br> \u00a0to the immortal gods as well as mortal humans. <br> \u00a0It has a hundred heads growing from the root up. <br> \u00a0Its sweet fragrance spread over the wide skies up above. <br> \u00a0And the earth below smiled back in all its radiance. So too the churning mass of the salty sea. <br></p><p> 15\u00a0 She [Persephone] was filled with a sense of wonder, and she reached out with both hands <br><a></a> to take hold of the pretty plaything.<sup><small><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292#fn2\" target=\"_blank\">2</a></small></sup> And the earth, full of roads leading every which way, opened up under her. <br> \u00a0It happened on the Plain of Nysa. There it was that the Lord who receives many guests made his lunge. <br> \u00a0He was riding on a chariot drawn by immortal horses. The son of Kronos. The one known by many names. <br> \u00a0He seized her against her will, put her on his golden chariot,\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>20\u00a0 <b>And drove away as she wept. She cried with a piercing voice, <br> \u00a0calling upon her father [Zeus], the son of Kronos, the highest and the best. <br> \u00a0But not one of the immortal ones, or of human mortals, <br> \u00a0heard her voice.</b> Not even the olive trees which bear their splendid harvest.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292\" target=\"_blank\">Homeric Hymns,\u00a0<i>To Demeter ll.\u00a0</i>5\u201320</a></b><br></p></blockquote><p>Noticed how Persephone calling out for aid echoes Sansa Sansa doing the same on two occasions. \u00a0And like with Persephone, no one answered her call.</p><p><b></b></p><h2></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><b>So\u00a0she\u00a0wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening,\u00a0calling\u00a0for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince</b>. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised and shaking. \u201cThey\u2019re killing everyone,\u201d the steward\u2019s daughter had shrieked at her.\u00a0She\u00a0went on and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer,\u00a0she\u00a0said. There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as\u00a0she\u00a0struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other\u2019s arms like sisters.<br></p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Sansa IV</b></p></blockquote>\n<p><br></p><blockquote><p>That night Sansa dreamed of the riot again. The mob surged around her, shrieking, a maddened beast with a thousand faces. </p><p>Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into monstrous inhuman masks. She wept and told them she had never done them hurt, yet they dragged her from her horse all the same. \u201cNo,\u201d she cried, \u201cno, please, don\u2019t, don\u2019t,\u201d but no one paid her any heed. <b>She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.</b> Women swarmed over her like weasels, pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly, and someone hit her in the face and she felt her teeth shatter. Then she saw the bright glimmer of steel. The knife plunged into her belly and tore and tore and tore, until there was nothing left of her down there but shiny wet ribbons.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Sansa IV</b></p></blockquote><p>I mentioned the abduction of Persephone to show that just as Sansa is symbolically connected to the goddess so too is Jonquil via the fact that George named her after the flower that was used to lure Demeter\u2019s into being captured by Hades.</p><p>Nevertheless, with a name like Jonquil, one must ask why wasn\u2019t that bloom as we know it today the one that the artist used in the black and white drawing. Why did George approve the use of a rose when one was not referenced in the scene with Florian and Jonquil? \u00a0It is quite a curious choice. \u00a0</p><p>Perhaps it was to suggest that the jonquil and the rose were one and the same. Or, maybe it also alludes to the possibility that Jonquil was the original blue winter rose and the female progenitor of the Stark line\u2014a role that like the daughter stolen by Bael the Bard, Sansa will quite likely have to play if the family name is to continue.\u00a0 What do you think?</p><p>The idea of Jonquil as the female forebearer of House Stark is a topic we will revisit in the near future but for now this brings us to the end of part 4. \u00a0In the next chapter, we take a look at Jonquil Darke and the multiple symbolic implications of her name\u2014including what it may mean to arcs of the daughters of House Stark. </p><p><b>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</b></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 2</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181474813231/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",
                "content": "<p>January 6, 2019</p><p>When is a mistake not a mistake? &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been pondering this question since I came across a repetitive line in <i>The Hedge Knight</i>. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong!&nbsp; There are other instances of George repeating phrases in the text. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s different about this one is the closeness of the repetition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This particular phrase is repeated so closely to the first mention that while at a quick glance it seemed like a mistake, it had to be deliberate on Martin&rsquo;s part with the intent to draw the reader&rsquo;s attention to a point surrounding the repetition? &nbsp;Writers have been known to repeat lines in this manner for emphasis and to highlight a theme. &nbsp;This is popularly done with poetry but it can be found in prose as well. &nbsp;</p><p>George himself has done it several times that I&rsquo;ve come across in the various books that make up the series&mdash;generally I think to highlight a point or to draw comparison to an idea. &nbsp;Usually it&rsquo;s spread out between books or point of views of different characters. &nbsp;Although it has happened a few times, it is also usually not a word for word repeat of the phrase. &nbsp;This is why when I came across two repetitive lines in back to back chapters of <i>The Hedge Knight</i> during a recent re-read, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to think. &nbsp;The reason for my uncertainty is because the lines in question are so mundane that I initially thought it was an error that was missed. &nbsp;However, it was the very run-of-the-mill wording of the sentences that made me think it might have been deliberate.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the repetitive lines to see what I&rsquo;m talking about. &nbsp;One of the passages I posted in the previous chapter when discussing the probability that Jonquil was a redhead. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m repeating it here in its entirety but I am also including a few additional lines to draw attention not just to the phrase repetition but also to show the similarity of the two passages. &nbsp;The repeated line is in bold font.</p><blockquote><p>By the time he splashed back across the ford to the south bank of the Cockleswent, the morning was almost done and the tourney grounds had come to life once more. </p><p><b>The winesellers and sausage makers were doing a brisk trade</b>, a dancing bear was shuffling along to his master&rsquo;s playing as a singer sang &ldquo;The Bear, the Bear, and the Maiden Fair,&rdquo; jugglers were juggling, and the puppeteers were just finishing another fight.</p><p>Dunk stopped to watch the wooden dragon slain. When the puppet knight cut its head off and the red sawdust spilled out onto the grass, he laughed aloud and threw the girl two coppers. &ldquo;One for last night,&rdquo; he called. She caught the coins in the air and threw him back a smile as sweet as any he had ever seen. &nbsp;Is it me she smiles at, or the coins? Dunk had never been with a girl, and they made him nervous. Once, three years past, when the old man&rsquo;s purse was full after half a year in the service of blind Lord Florent, he&rsquo;d told Dunk the time had come to take him to a brothel and make him a man. He&rsquo;d been drunk, though, and when he was sober he did not remember. Dunk had been too embarrassed to remind him.</p><p>He was not certain he wanted a whore anyway. If he could not have a highborn maiden like a proper knight, he wanted one who at least liked him more than his silver.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>Try as I might not to do so, when I write, I tend to repeat phrases a bit too often. &nbsp;In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty confident that I&rsquo;ve probably done so in this essay series. It&rsquo;s not deliberate on my part but simply a matter of complacency because I&rsquo;m not a true writer and so tend to resort to crutch phrases.</p><p>On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t think that any author as talented as George would mistakenly use the same sentence in back to back chapters and not be aware of it. &nbsp;Also, not even a junior editor let alone one who has been at it as long as George&rsquo;s editor, Anne Groell, would miss that type of mistake by their author. &nbsp;And if by some strange chance both the author and editor did miss the mistake, the copyeditor whose job it is to read the manuscript and catch such errors would not.</p><p>However, there are no absolutes in life and while highly unlikely, one cannot say with 100% certainty that it was not a simple mistake. &nbsp;I tend to think that if it were, it would have been found by now and corrected in subsequent printings of the book, which has not been the case. &nbsp;This suggests that the repetition of the two lines was deliberate on George&rsquo;s part.</p><p>As the odds are against those involved with the writing and production of the book missing the error, let&rsquo;s work under the assumption that it was deliberate and speculate on what George might have been trying to highlight by looking at the similarities between the two excerpts.</p><p>In the first passage posted above, Dunk throws Tanselle two coppers in appreciation of her performance during the puppet show. &nbsp;One of the coppers he tells her is for last night&hellip;meaning the puppet performance, which he also saw the night before. &nbsp;However, the throwing of the coins and his use of the phrase, &ldquo;one for last night&rdquo; in and of itself has very strong inferences of the paying of a whore. &nbsp;</p><p>This is reinforced by his thoughts after Tanselle smiles at him upon receiving the coins. &nbsp;He wonders whether the smile is for him or his coins and he thinks back on an event three years past when a drunken Ser Arlan promised to take him to a brothel for his first time with a woman. &nbsp;As the old man was drunk, he forgot and by the time he meets Tanselle, Dunk is still a virgin. &nbsp;</p><p>The above passage continues with Dunk inviting Tanselle to share a horn of ale. In mythology the horn symbolize male sexuality and in western cultures, sausages are often associated with the male genitals, which makes the words Martin uses overtly sexual.</p><blockquote><p>\"Will you drink a horn of ale?&rdquo; he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. &ldquo;With me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They&rsquo;re made with pork, I think.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>It makes one wonder what Martin is implying when he says the wine sellers and sausage makers are doing a brisk trade. &nbsp;We also shouldn&rsquo;t forget that as he walked toward the puppeteers, Dunk passed a dancing bear and a bard singing <i>The Bear and the Maiden Fair</i>, which is a highly sexual song. &nbsp;This song is also strongly associated with Sansa in the story proper as Butterbumps sings it in its entirety during her interrogation by the Queen of Thorns. &nbsp;Now here we see Martin also associating it with Jonquil.</p><p>The wine seller and sausage maker line is repeated in the very next chapter and again it occurs as Dunk approaches the pavilion where the puppeteers are performing the story of Florian and Jonquil. &nbsp;Also again it is associated with thoughts of money and a whore as he spies the redheaded one across the way and considers paying for her services. &nbsp;He is concerned that she might rob him while he sleeps and so passes on the opportunity.</p><blockquote><p><b>The wine sellers and sausage makers were doing a brisk trade</b>, and whores walked brazenly among the stalls and pavilions. Some were pretty enough, one red-haired girl in particular. He could not help staring at her breasts, the way they moved under her loose shift as she sauntered past. He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She&rsquo;d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous &hellip; but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the red-haired girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, Dunk shook his head and walked away.</p><p>He found Egg at the puppet show, sitting crosslegged on the ground with the hood of his cloak pulled all the way forward to hide his baldness. </p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>The young knight with the raging hormones watches another performance of the puppet show and has his second conversation with Jonquil afterwards. However, I will be leaving a breakdown of the dialogue from that specific scene for when I discuss Florian and Jonquil as a couple.</p><p>Both passages of course talk about the heavy business occurring at the booths of the wine sellers and sausage makers and takes place right before Dunk&rsquo;s interaction with Tanselle and exposition on the story of Florian and Jonquill via the puppet shows. &nbsp;The two passages also include an overt amount of sexual dialogue and thoughts on Dunk&rsquo;s part&hellip;particularly regarding whores.</p><p>Why this striking association of whores in the Florian and Jonquil story? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not just the scenes with Dunk but also how Martin uses Dancy the whore at Chatya&rsquo;s establishment in Kings Landing to possibly hint at Jonquil. &nbsp;And Sansa is of course currently under the control of Petyr, a brothel owner. &nbsp;She has not been forced into prostitution but her best friend Jeyne was not so lucky. &nbsp;In addition to prostitution, Jeyne has been forced to marry Ramsay Bolton as an Arya stand-in.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also not just Sansa and Jeyne as in the Mercy preview chapter from TWOW, Arya plays the part of a lady of the evening in her quest to cross a name off her list.</p><p>I have to say that I was stumped when I discovered this connection to whores in the sister&rsquo;s storyline until a possible explanation came to me about what Martin maybe symbolically implying. &nbsp;I think that it&rsquo;s possible that one of the reasons we get so many references to whores in the story is that as he is using Jon as the symbolic Last Hero/Christ like figure in the story who will return from the dead to be the savior of mankind, Jonquil/Sansa may represents his Mary Magdalene counterpart. </p><p>Like with the tale of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, there are many different versions to the biblical myths surrounding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Magdalene</a>&mdash;including the earlier belief that she was a repentant prostitute. She is often conflated with <a href=\"https://en.wikip\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Bethany</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7:36%E2%80%9350&amp;version=NRSV\" target=\"_blank\">sinful woman</a> who washed Christ&rsquo;s feet as referenced in the Gospel of Luke. &nbsp;And there are some biblical scholars who believe that there was some type of romantic relationship between Christ and Mary. </p><p>Another woman of whom Mary Magdalene is confused is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Egypt\" target=\"_blank\">Mary of Egypt</a>, the prostitute who later became a saint. &nbsp;In fact, in some Medieval paintings, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Egypt are rendered in similar manner with a skull to signify their penitence, which no doubt contributed to the confusion between the two.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab7d4aed5ae22e300775b9346612c074/tumblr_inline_pkxn5ukBgN1scj86c_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>(Left) Mary Magdalene with the Smoking Flame by&nbsp;Georges de La Tour [Public domain], courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Georges_de_La_Tour_-_Magdalen_of_Night_Light_-_WGA12337.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>; (Right) Mary of Egypt by&nbsp;Jusepe de Ribera [Public domain] courtesy <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:S._Maria_Egiziaca_by_Jusepe_de_Ribera.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>Now before anyone starts wondering if I am saying that Jonquil was a prostitute, the answer is no. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t believe that was the case. &nbsp;I am talking about George adding texture to the story. &nbsp;It is part of his world building. &nbsp;He is playing with the mythological story of Christ throughout his story as the savior of man. &nbsp;This includes the Last Hero and his 12 Apostle like companions and now Jon and his future Christ like return from the dead. </p><p>The show had Jon going beyond the Wall with 12 companions on the wight hunt and it&rsquo;s possible that something similar will happen in the books as well. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t expect something as stupid as a wight hunt but I think that we can all agree that the Wall will fall. &nbsp;And as others before me have speculated, I can see Jon and 12 companions heading further north for a final showdown with the Others that would in some way mirror the events with the Last Hero. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Mary Magdalene like the 12 disciples is a major part of the Christian myth about the Christ and a big part of her legend is the belief by some that she was a prostitute. &nbsp;It is this belief that I think Martin maybe playing with to add texture to his story. &nbsp;</p><p>This does not mean Jonquil was a whore as Mary Magdalene most likely was not one. &nbsp;It simply means that Martin is possibly playing with the idea of this part of her myth. &nbsp;He has played with it in other ways in the text. There is actually a scene with Jon in ACOK, which I&rsquo;ve discussed in a previous essay series that echoes the resurrection of the Christ and Mary Magdalene being the first one to discover his return.</p><blockquote><p>He woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air. When he moved, his bones ached. Ghost was gone, the fire burnt out. <b>Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he&rsquo;d hung over the rock, and found it stiff and frozen</b>. &nbsp;He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal.</p><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every blade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond. &nbsp;Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen . Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice.</p><p><i>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all</i>. &nbsp;He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he&rsquo;d dreamed of them last night. &nbsp;Sansa would call this an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but Arya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Lord Snow</i>?&rdquo; he heard. Soft and meek. He turned.</p><p><b>Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper</b>, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her. Sam&rsquo;s cloak, Jon realized at once. Why is she wearing Sam&rsquo;s cloak? &ldquo;The fat one told me I&rsquo;d find you here, m'lord,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>In the scene above, Jon&rsquo;s little sleeping chamber that he created by hanging his cloak at the opening to protect him from the elements represents is the symbolic tomb of Christ. &nbsp;And when he pulls it aside to crawl out, he is symbolically rolling back the rock that sealed Christ&rsquo;s tomb. &nbsp;His black brothers or symbolic disciples are still asleep and so are not aware that he has arisen. &nbsp;His cold breath and aching bones also signify that he has come back from the other side where he was symbolically frozen in death. &nbsp;It also hints at his future death and the vision Bran saw of him in the ice cave as his body lost all warmth.</p><p>Gilly symbolically plays two roles in the scene. &nbsp;With her wearing Sam&rsquo;s cloak, she is symbolically his wife, which hints at their future relationship. &nbsp;However, as the only person there when Jon exits his symbolic tomb, she also takes on the role of Mary Magdalene.</p><p>There are different versions of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ in the various gospels but the common denominator in all is the presence Mary Magdalene at his death, burial and as one of the first witnesses of his empty tomb.</p><p>In some telling of the story, Mary is one of the three women who discover the stone removed from the tomb of Christ. &nbsp;They enter to find the body gone and the presence of an angel who tells them that Christ has risen and they should go and spread the word to his disciples. In two other gospels they don&rsquo;t enter the tomb but an angel rolls away the rock and tells them that Christ has risen. &nbsp;Jesus then appears to them and tells them to go and notify the disciples that he has risen and to meet him in Galilee. &nbsp;And in the Gospel of John, Mary goes to the tomb alone and it is there that the Christ appears to her.</p><blockquote><p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:1\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:1&ndash;10</a>, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb alone when it was still dark and saw that the stone had already been rolled away. &nbsp;She did not see anyone, but immediately ran to tell Peter and the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved\" target=\"_blank\">beloved disciple</a>,&rdquo; who came with her to the tomb and confirmed that it was empty but returned home without seeing the risen Jesus. &nbsp;According to <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/John%22%20%5Cl%20%2220:11\" target=\"_blank\">John 20:11&ndash;18</a>, Mary, now alone in the garden outside the tomb, saw two angels sitting where Jesus&rsquo;s body had been. &nbsp;Then the risen Jesus approached her. &nbsp;She at first mistook him for the gardener, but, after she heard him say her name, she recognized him and cried out &ldquo;Rabbouni!&rdquo; (which is Aramaic for &ldquo;teacher\"). &nbsp;She tried to touch him, but he told her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my father.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jesus then sent her to tell the other apostles the good news of his resurrection. &nbsp;The Gospel of John therefore portrays Mary Magdalene as the first apostle, the apostle sent <i>to</i> the apostles.</p><p>&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Wikipedia</b></a></p></blockquote><p>Jon thinks that there is magic beyond the Wall. &nbsp;In the story, life beyond the Wall denotes another life for the people of Westeros. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the symbolic &ldquo;other side.&rdquo; &nbsp;And so Jon&rsquo;s viewing it as magical can be said to tie into the Christian belief of a second life.</p><p>Arya and Sansa enter his thoughts when he sees the crystallization of the forests. &nbsp;His thoughts of them figuratively add two additional women to the scene and with Gilly&rsquo;s literal presence there are symbolically three women there at his return, which plays into the other biblical myths of three women being present at the return of the Christ.</p><p>In my essay, <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/172429311701/waking-in-a-winter-wonderland-an-analys\" target=\"_blank\">Waking in a Winter Wonderland</a><i>,</i> I argued that Sansa&rsquo;s snowy garden scene in the Eyrie was a symbolic continuation of the icy Jon one from the haunted forest posted above. &nbsp;I have also argued that there are strong clues in Sansa&rsquo;s scene that suggest Jon will be in the Vale. &nbsp;Now after reading the biblical verse where the risen Christ approaches Mary Magdalene&hellip;most likely as dawn was breaking, I feel even more strongly that I&rsquo;m on to something.</p><blockquote><p><b>Dawn stole into her garden like a thief.</b> The grey of the sky grew lighter still, and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath <b>their stoles of snow</b>.</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Sansa VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Christ was the sun/son who brought the dawn and hope for mankind with his return from the dead. &nbsp;In the story told in the central books of the series, Jon is the symbolic sun/son and with him comes the dawn. &nbsp;When he first appeared to her, Mary Magdalene thought Christ was the gardener arriving for work, which suggest that his tomb was located in a garden. &nbsp; As she was alone there in the morning, it was symbolically her garden he entered. &nbsp;And just as dawn in the form of Christ entered Mary Magdalene&rsquo;s garden, it also steals into Sansa&rsquo;s but in her case, the bringer of dawn is symbolically Jon.</p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>FLORIAN AND JONQUIL, AND THE BLUE WINTER ROSE</b></p><p>This next section was previously published as a preview of this essay series. &nbsp;You can find the article <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/178966949166/florian-and-jonquil-jon-and-sansa-and-the-blue\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>The Dunk and Egg novellas are some of the most enjoyable stories of the entire series and I highly recommend reading them. &nbsp;Recently, as I sat on the train during the evening commute, getting lost again in their adventures, one of my theories jumped out at me from one of the drawings in <i>The Hedge Knight</i>.</p><p>If you have read my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/166683154156/of-sansa-stark-the-glass-menagerie-the-rose-of-sharon-jo\" target=\"_blank\">Of Stark and the Glass Menagerie</a> essay, you are aware of my theory that the famous Blue Winter Rose is actually the jonquil flower. &nbsp;There are several reasons for this theory not the least being that the modern rose is a cultivated flower that did not exist during medieval or more ancient times. &nbsp;However, the jonquil flower did and it was considered by many to be a wild rose. &nbsp;In fact many scholars believe that the narcissus-jonquilla is actually the Rose of Sharon flower referenced in the famous biblical poem, <i>Song of Solomon</i>.</p><blockquote><p>Female</p><p>I am the rose of Sharon,<br />\nand the lily of the valleys. <br /></p><p>Male</p><p>As the lily among thorns,<br />\nso is my love among the daughters. </p></blockquote><p>It is my theory that while the blue winter rose Dany saw in the chink in the wall tips to Lyanna as Jon&rsquo;s mother, in the story proper, it is more indicative of Sansa Stark, her importance to the story; connection to Jon Snow; and their future relationship.</p><p>I think that hints of this relationship is there in many of the ancient tales because just as George uses the story proper to provide clues to the stories of the past, he also uses the tales and songs of times past as hints to the current story. One such ancient tale that I think Martin uses to strongly denote things to come in the books are the story about Florian and Jonquil. </p><p>And so, there I was sitting on the train, getting lost in the adventures of Dunk and Egg when suddenly a drawing of Florian and Jonquil jump out at me. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen this drawing a million times and yet there is something about the image that I never noticed until that night. &nbsp;</p><p>Those of you familiar with the Dunk and Egg stories will know that black and white line drawings are included throughout. &nbsp;These drawings showcase various scenes from the books and are pretty exact representation of the scene described. &nbsp;Here is one from Egg&rsquo;s confrontation with his older brother Aerion Brightflame.</p><p>The hands holding his left arm were gone, and then the others. Dunk did not understand what was happening. The men-at-arms were backing away. One even knelt. Then the crowd parted for Raymun Fossoway. He had donned mail and helm, and his hand was on his sword. His cousin Ser Steffon, just behind him, had already bared his blade, and with them were a half-dozen men-at-arms with the red apple badge sewn on their breasts.</p><p>Prince Aerion paid them no mind. \"Impudent little wretch,&rdquo; he said to Egg, spitting a mouthful of blood at the boy&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;What happened to your hair?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cut it off, brother,&rdquo; said Egg. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to look like you.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cde62a095830ab91c944fc3000ade4/tumblr_inline_pkxcd8w5aj1scj86c_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Noticed that even the spittle from Aerion is included in the drawing. &nbsp;I mention all this and showed the image with Egg to demonstrate how detail the drawings are in rendering the scene described.</p><p>I am pretty confident that as is most likely the case with any official image associated with ASOIAF, George approved all drawings used in the Dunk and Egg novella in advance of publication of the books. &nbsp;This is why I find the Florian and Jonquil image to be very curious in nature. &nbsp;During the puppet show, Florian is described as kneeling to Jonquil and here is the scene shown in the drawing. I want you to look closely because there is something very interesting about the scene in question.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcfae98de22e2e880390985e6affe4f2/tumblr_inline_pkxckbf2GA1scj86c_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Did you see it? &nbsp;</p><p>If not, look again at the lower right hand corner at what is laying on the ground in the scene. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s none other than a rose! &nbsp;Now believe me when I tell you that at no point during the puppet show and Dunk&rsquo;s thoughts are there ever a mention of a rose. And yet, there is one shown in the drawing.&nbsp; This is not to say that the word rose is never mentioned in the text.&nbsp; Leo Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden at the time is present and and so the word is used in relation to him.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is never once used to refer to either Jonquil or Tanselle and yet one is shown in the illustration.&nbsp;</p><p>Now the drawings are in black and white and so there is no color assigned to the rose in the image.&nbsp; However, as Jonquil is so closely associated with Sansa Stark who is a symbolic blue winter rose, I would harbor a guess that the reader is meant to see the rose on the floor as a blue rose.&nbsp; To me, this strongly indicates that the blue rose connects to the story of Florian and Jonquil and so the question then becomes why?</p><p>There are two iconic flowers in the story and they both connect to the daughters of House Stark. &nbsp;When I refer to the jonquil as an iconic flower in the story it is not to say that the physical flower appears in the tale&mdash;at least not yet. &nbsp;However, it does appear symbolically in the form of Sansa, the eldest daughter of House Stark. &nbsp;My question to you is what do you think the odds are that both flowers strongly associated with the daughter of the most important family in the story are two totally different sweet smelling blooms? &nbsp;I say it&rsquo;s little to none.</p><p>The physical jonquil flower may not have appeared in the story proper but it may in the future when we learn more about the fair maiden who bore its name.&nbsp; And it would not matter if it doesn&rsquo;t make an appearance because ultimately it&rsquo;s about the symbolism and it is very present in Sansa&rsquo;s arc.&nbsp; Jonquil in a way was the symbolic Rose of Sharon.&nbsp; She was the lily of the valley or vale as it were since the two words are synonyms of each other.</p><p>As I also discussed in my <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/171001805336/speaker-of-the-dead-or-do-direwolves-dream-of-the\" target=\"_blank\">Do Direwolves Dream of the Weirwood Net</a> essay, Persephone was kidnapped while picking jonquils from the Vale of Nysa, a mountainous valley very like the Vale of Arryn in the books.</p><blockquote><p>In the Homeric &ldquo;<a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292\" target=\"_blank\">Hymn to Demeter</a>,&rdquo; the story is told of how <b>Persephone was gathering flowers in the Vale of Nysa</b> when she was seized by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hades-Greek-mythology\" target=\"_blank\">Hades</a> and removed to the underworld. Upon learning of the abduction, her mother, Demeter, in her misery, became unconcerned with the harvest or the fruitfulness of the earth, so that widespread famine ensued. Zeus therefore intervened, commanding Hades to release Persephone to her mother. Because Persephone had eaten a single pomegranate seed in the underworld, however, she could not be completely freed but had to remain one-third of the year with Hades, and spent the other two-thirds with her mother. The story that Persephone spent four months of each year in the underworld was no doubt meant to account for the barren appearance of Greek fields in full summer&mdash;after harvest, before their revival in the autumn rains, when they are plowed and sown.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Persephone-Greek-goddess\" target=\"_blank\">Encyclopedia Brittanica</a>&nbsp;</b> &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The beauty and sweet smell of the narcissus jonquilla flower were also used to lure Persephone to her capture.</p><blockquote><p>5 &nbsp;She [Persephone] was having a good time, along with the daughters of Okeanos, who wear their waistbands slung low. <br /> &nbsp;She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets. <br /> &nbsp;Up and down the soft meadow. Iris blossoms too she picked, and hyacinth. <br /> &nbsp;And the narcissus, which was grown as a lure for the flower-faced girl <br /> &nbsp;by Gaia [Earth]. All according to the plans of Zeus. She [Gaia] was doing a favor for the one who receives many guests [H&#257;d&#275;s].</p><p> 10&nbsp; It [the narcissus] was a wondrous thing in its splendor. To look at it gives a sense of holy awe <br /> &nbsp;to the immortal gods as well as mortal humans. <br /> &nbsp;It has a hundred heads growing from the root up. <br /> &nbsp;Its sweet fragrance spread over the wide skies up above. <br /> &nbsp;And the earth below smiled back in all its radiance. So too the churning mass of the salty sea. <br /></p><p> 15&nbsp; She [Persephone] was filled with a sense of wonder, and she reached out with both hands <br /><a></a> to take hold of the pretty plaything.<sup><small><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292#fn2\" target=\"_blank\">2</a></small></sup> And the earth, full of roads leading every which way, opened up under her. <br /> &nbsp;It happened on the Plain of Nysa. There it was that the Lord who receives many guests made his lunge. <br /> &nbsp;He was riding on a chariot drawn by immortal horses. The son of Kronos. The one known by many names. <br /> &nbsp;He seized her against her will, put her on his golden chariot,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>20&nbsp; <b>And drove away as she wept. She cried with a piercing voice, <br /> &nbsp;calling upon her father [Zeus], the son of Kronos, the highest and the best. <br /> &nbsp;But not one of the immortal ones, or of human mortals, <br /> &nbsp;heard her voice.</b> Not even the olive trees which bear their splendid harvest.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5292\" target=\"_blank\">Homeric Hymns,&nbsp;<i>To Demeter ll.&nbsp;</i>5&ndash;20</a></b><br /></p></blockquote><p>Noticed how Persephone calling out for aid echoes Sansa Sansa doing the same on two occasions. &nbsp;And like with Persephone, no one answered her call.</p><p><b></b></p><h2></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><b>So&nbsp;she&nbsp;wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening,&nbsp;calling&nbsp;for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince</b>. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised and shaking. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re killing everyone,&rdquo; the steward&rsquo;s daughter had shrieked at her.&nbsp;She&nbsp;went on and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer,&nbsp;she&nbsp;said. There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as&nbsp;she&nbsp;struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other&rsquo;s arms like sisters.<br /></p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Sansa IV</b></p></blockquote>\n<p><br /></p><blockquote><p>That night Sansa dreamed of the riot again. The mob surged around her, shrieking, a maddened beast with a thousand faces. </p><p>Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into monstrous inhuman masks. She wept and told them she had never done them hurt, yet they dragged her from her horse all the same. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;no, please, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; but no one paid her any heed. <b>She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.</b> Women swarmed over her like weasels, pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly, and someone hit her in the face and she felt her teeth shatter. Then she saw the bright glimmer of steel. The knife plunged into her belly and tore and tore and tore, until there was nothing left of her down there but shiny wet ribbons.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Sansa IV</b></p></blockquote><p>I mentioned the abduction of Persephone to show that just as Sansa is symbolically connected to the goddess so too is Jonquil via the fact that George named her after the flower that was used to lure Demeter&rsquo;s into being captured by Hades.</p><p>Nevertheless, with a name like Jonquil, one must ask why wasn&rsquo;t that bloom as we know it today the one that the artist used in the black and white drawing. Why did George approve the use of a rose when one was not referenced in the scene with Florian and Jonquil? &nbsp;It is quite a curious choice. &nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps it was to suggest that the jonquil and the rose were one and the same. Or, maybe it also alludes to the possibility that Jonquil was the original blue winter rose and the female progenitor of the Stark line&mdash;a role that like the daughter stolen by Bael the Bard, Sansa will quite likely have to play if the family name is to continue.&nbsp; What do you think?</p><p>The idea of Jonquil as the female forebearer of House Stark is a topic we will revisit in the near future but for now this brings us to the end of part 4. &nbsp;In the next chapter, we take a look at Jonquil Darke and the multiple symbolic implications of her name&mdash;including what it may mean to arcs of the daughters of House Stark. </p><p><b>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</b></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 2</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181474813231/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>January 6, 2019</p>\n<p>When is a mistake not a mistake? &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been pondering this question since I came across a repetitive line in <i>The Hedge Knight</i>. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong!&nbsp; There are other instances of George repeating phrases in the text. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s different about this one is the closeness of the repetition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This particular phrase is repeated so closely to the first mention that while at a quick glance it seemed like a mistake, it had to be deliberate on Martin&rsquo;s part with the intent to draw the reader&rsquo;s attention to a point surrounding the repetition? &nbsp;Writers have been known to repeat lines in this manner for emphasis and to highlight a theme. &nbsp;This is popularly done with poetry but it can be found in prose as well. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>George himself has done it several times that I&rsquo;ve come across in the various books that make up the series&mdash;generally I think to highlight a point or to draw comparison to an idea. &nbsp;Usually it&rsquo;s spread out between books or point of views of different characters. &nbsp;Although it has happened a few times, it is also usually not a word for word repeat of the phrase. &nbsp;This is why when I came across two repetitive lines in back to back chapters of <i>The Hedge Knight</i> during a recent re-read, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to think. &nbsp;The reason for my uncertainty is because the lines in question are so mundane that I initially thought it was an error that was missed. &nbsp;However, it was the very run-of-the-mill wording of the sentences that made me think it might have been deliberate.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the repetitive lines to see what I&rsquo;m talking about. &nbsp;One of the passages I posted in the previous chapter when discussing the probability that Jonquil was a redhead. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m repeating it here in its entirety but I am also including a few additional lines to draw attention not just to the phrase repetition but also to show the similarity of the two passages. &nbsp;The repeated line is in bold font.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the time he splashed back across the ford to the south bank of the Cockleswent, the morning was almost done and the tourney grounds had come to life once more. </p>\n<p><b>The winesellers and sausage makers were doing a brisk trade</b>, a dancing bear was shuffling along to his master&rsquo;s playing as a singer sang &ldquo;The Bear, the Bear, and the Maiden Fair,&rdquo; jugglers were juggling, and the puppeteers were just finishing another fight.</p>\n<p>Dunk stopped to watch the wooden dragon slain. When the puppet knight cut its head off and the red sawdust spilled out onto the grass, he laughed aloud and threw the girl two coppers. &ldquo;One for last night,&rdquo; he called. She caught the coins in the air and threw him back a smile as sweet as any he had ever seen. &nbsp;Is it me she smiles at, or the coins? Dunk had never been with a girl, and they made him nervous. Once, three years past, when the old man&rsquo;s purse was full after half a year in the service of blind Lord Florent, he&rsquo;d told Dunk the time had come to take him to a brothel and make him a man. He&rsquo;d been drunk, though, and when he was sober he did not remember. Dunk had been too embarrassed to remind him.</p>\n<p>He was not certain he wanted a whore anyway. If he could not have a highborn maiden like a proper knight, he wanted one who at least liked him more than his silver.</p>\n<p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>",

In season 2, Theon Greyjoy conquered Winterfell and when Bran and Rickon Stark managed to escape him, he killed a pair of peasant boys to deceive people into thinking that the two Stark boys are dead. Thus, in the eyes of Westeros, Sansa is now Robb Stark\u2019s heir apparent to Winterfell and that makes her a very important piece on the political chessboard. <b>If Robb dies without an heir, Winterfell goes to Sansa and whoever manages to secure her in marriage </b>- and there are several power players who are interested in her: Petyr Baelish, the Lannisters and now the Tyrells who are emerging as a new power in King\u2019s Landing with Margaery set to become Queen, her courting the goodwill of the common folk and her family not only supporting the Lannisters militarily but also feeding the starving populace of King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>In my previous <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">post</a>, I looked at how Olenna and Margaery Tyrell\u2019s initial interest in Sansa was solely motivated by some nasty rumours about Joffrey that worried them as Margaery is set to marry him. However, in episode 4 Lord Varys encourages Olenna Tyrell to take a further interest in Sansa after he learns that Baelish has plans to spirit Sansa away from King\u2019s Landing. Varys approaches Olenna Tyrell and he broaches the idea of a marriage alliance between Sansa Stark and House Tyrell. He says he wants to help Sansa but his main motivation is to keep her out of the hands of Petyr Baelish.\u00a0</p><h2>This is the first time that Sansa is referred to as the <b>Key to the North</b> in the show, but it will not be the last.\u00a0</h2><p>As previously stated, Sansa is Robb\u2019s heir apparent and as such her political value is very high - and Varys seeks to keep the Key to the North out of the hands of Petyr Baelish whom he deems to be one of the most dangerous men of the realm. Thus, Sansa becomes a political pawn in the shadow war between Varys and Baelish, between one who wants to serve the realm and one who only serves himself.</p><!-- more --><p><b>COURTED BY THE TYRELLS</b></p><p>The scene between Varys and Olenna is immediately followed by a scene where Margaery seeks out Sansa as she\u2019s praying at a tree stump, the sad remains of\u00a0 Godswood in King\u2019s Landing. The segue between the two scenes makes it clear that Olenna has sent Margaery to charm and befriend Sansa once again since Olenna managed to alienate the girl during their lunch in episode 2, a scene that I covered in my <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">previous post</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/394b52516f8db41632f64619296d20ea/tumblr_inline_pktd37HNsp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1072\"/></figure><p>Margaery approaches and uses her status as the future Queen to send away the Lannister soldiers that guard Sansa so they can have a private\nconversation.</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>What did you pray for?</i></p></blockquote><p>Here\nMargaery whispers to create an atmosphere of intimacy between them.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(smiling): <i>I can\u2019t tell you.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is\nimportant to note that even while Sansa is genuinely friendly here, she doesn\u2019t\nreally trust Margaery. Even when Margaery presses her again on this subject,\nSansa refuses to reveal anything about her personal feelings and hopes. Sansa is understandably wary about the Tyrells after the upsetting luncheon where she found out that they weren\u2019t really interested in being kind to her for her sake but that they only sought out her company because they wanted something from her - and Olenna was pretty aggressive with her. So now Margaery has her work cut out for her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6b18e71f4f3d8e15831829486514bec/tumblr_inline_pktd2npH7A1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Margaery tells jokes and\nanecdotes, making Sansa laugh. <b>With these little secrets and inconsequential\nstories from her childhood she creates a sense of intimacy and companionship \u2013\nas if Sansa is indeed a treasured friend, which is something that is incredibly\nenticing for a girl as lonely and abused as Sansa is.</b></p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I want us to be friends.</i></p></blockquote><p>Here the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa, looking at Margaery with an almost incredulous smile on her\nface. <b>She almost can\u2019t believe that anyone would want to be her friend anymore.\nSansa is THAT isolated in King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"237\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/545c608b0eee5d94ad87b56e0150c9ec/tumblr_inline_pkuy6b0uXQ1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"237\"/></figure><p>Margaery goes on to paint a very\nattractive image of Highgarden, featuring all the things that Sansa loved\nbefore she came to experience the hard truth beneath the glamour of the\ncapital. When Sansa doubts that Cersei will let her leave King\u2019s Landing,\nMargaery invokes her future status as Queen Consort, implicitly promising that\nshe\u2019ll make sure Sansa can leave King\u2019s Landing after the royal marriage. Then,\nMargaery mentions the real reason for her seeking out Sansa:</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>And if you were to marry my brother Loras\u2026\u00a0</i><i>your place would be at Highgarden,\nwouldn\u2019t it?</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s\nsmile grows bigger as Margery is now offering her an escape from her abusers at\ncourt. But Margaery offers even more than just an escape, she offers the promise of family.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/231e826d5a2363f4fad5d39fb2c8becd/tumblr_inline_pktd3yTdcp1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b851f3187a3f9b75309c06ac7967c95d/tumblr_inline_pktded66RX1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"220\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0a0941759109ee5e3c33f9f451072fd/tumblr_inline_pktdesi5hA1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"220\"/></figure><p>This is\nwhere Sansa becomes visibly overwhelmed, smiling through unshed tears as\nMargaery offers not just an escape from her torment but also friendship, family\nand sisterhood - things that Sansa has been without for too long. <b>It is interesting that Margaery uses the same lure as Petyr Baelish: the promise of family. However, Sansa choosing Margaery\u2019s offer doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s abandoning her family. It simply means that she\u2019s choosing the less dangerous option of gaining protection and getting out of King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0</b>Not only is it very dangerous to flee secretly, she has also been explicitly warned about Baelish by a person she trusts (Shae). In contrast, Margaery offers the protection of House Tyrell through marriage and the Tyrells are on the rise. They hold considerable political power as they are feeding King\u2019s Landing and Margaery is set to be Queen. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Tyrells can secure her safety and happiness without exposing her to additional danger - unlike what Baelish offers.</p><p>This scene\nreally highlights Sophie Turner\u2019s stellar acting. She has a wonderfully\nexpressive face and she manages the delicate balance between smiles and tears\nbeautifully. Thus, Margaery successfully cultivates Sansa\u2019s friendship and\ngratitude through a carefully deployed charm. What remains to be seen is\nwhether Margaery\u2019s friendship is a genuine offer.</p><p>In the very next episode we see Sansa and Margaery bonding as they watch Loras at weapon\u2019s training. Once again Margaery assures Sansa that she\u2019ll be able to influence Joffrey to let Sansa marry Loras and leave King\u2019s Landing for Highgarden.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Joffrey won\u2019t let me leave. He\u2019s got too\nmany reasons to keep me here.</i><br/></p><p>Margaery: <i>And only one to let you go. Because it will\nplease me.</i></p></blockquote><p>However, I do think\nthat Margaery is somewhat over-confident here because she doesn\u2019t really know just how much of a monster Joffrey is because Sansa never told the Tyrells that Joffrey didn\u2019t just kill her father and forced her to look at his severed head, but that he also has her publicly beaten by his King\u2019s Guard.</p><p>This scene is immediately followed by a scene where Loras has sex with the squire Olyvar who is also in Baelish\u2019s employ - and Loras lets slip that he is set to marry Sansa.

The segue between the two scenes makes it clear that Olenna has sent Margaery to charm and befriend Sansa once again since Olenna managed to alienate the girl during their lunch in episode 2, a scene that I covered in my <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">previous post</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/394b52516f8db41632f64619296d20ea/tumblr_inline_pktd37HNsp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1072\"></figure><p>Margaery approaches and uses her status as the future Queen to send away the Lannister soldiers that guard Sansa so they can have a private\nconversation.</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>What did you pray for?</i></p></blockquote><p>Here\nMargaery whispers to create an atmosphere of intimacy between them.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(smiling): <i>I can\u2019t tell you.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is\nimportant to note that even while Sansa is genuinely friendly here, she doesn\u2019t\nreally trust Margaery. Even when Margaery presses her again on this subject,\nSansa refuses to reveal anything about her personal feelings and hopes. Sansa is understandably wary about the Tyrells after the upsetting luncheon where she found out that they weren\u2019t really interested in being kind to her for her sake but that they only sought out her company because they wanted something from her - and Olenna was pretty aggressive with her. So now Margaery has her work cut out for her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6b18e71f4f3d8e15831829486514bec/tumblr_inline_pktd2npH7A1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>Margaery tells jokes and\nanecdotes, making Sansa laugh. <b>With these little secrets and inconsequential\nstories from her childhood she creates a sense of intimacy and companionship \u2013\nas if Sansa is indeed a treasured friend, which is something that is incredibly\nenticing for a girl as lonely and abused as Sansa is.</b></p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I want us to be friends.</i></p></blockquote><p>Here the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa, looking at Margaery with an almost incredulous smile on her\nface. <b>She almost can\u2019t believe that anyone would want to be her friend anymore.\nSansa is THAT isolated in King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"237\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/545c608b0eee5d94ad87b56e0150c9ec/tumblr_inline_pkuy6b0uXQ1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"237\"></figure><p>Margaery goes on to paint a very\nattractive image of Highgarden, featuring all the things that Sansa loved\nbefore she came to experience the hard truth beneath the glamour of the\ncapital. When Sansa doubts that Cersei will let her leave King\u2019s Landing,\nMargaery invokes her future status as Queen Consort, implicitly promising that\nshe\u2019ll make sure Sansa can leave King\u2019s Landing after the royal marriage. Then,\nMargaery mentions the real reason for her seeking out Sansa:</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>And if you were to marry my brother Loras\u2026\u00a0</i><i>your place would be at Highgarden,\nwouldn\u2019t it?</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s\nsmile grows bigger as Margery is now offering her an escape from her abusers at\ncourt.

However, Sansa choosing Margaery\u2019s offer doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s abandoning her family. It simply means that she\u2019s choosing the less dangerous option of gaining protection and getting out of King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0</b>Not only is it very dangerous to flee secretly, she has also been explicitly warned about Baelish by a person she trusts (Shae). In contrast, Margaery offers the protection of House Tyrell through marriage and the Tyrells are on the rise. They hold considerable political power as they are feeding King\u2019s Landing and Margaery is set to be Queen. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Tyrells can secure her safety and happiness without exposing her to additional danger - unlike what Baelish offers.</p><p>This scene\nreally highlights Sophie Turner\u2019s stellar acting. She has a wonderfully\nexpressive face and she manages the delicate balance between smiles and tears\nbeautifully. Thus, Margaery successfully cultivates Sansa\u2019s friendship and\ngratitude through a carefully deployed charm. What remains to be seen is\nwhether Margaery\u2019s friendship is a genuine offer.</p><p>In the very next episode we see Sansa and Margaery bonding as they watch Loras at weapon\u2019s training. Once again Margaery assures Sansa that she\u2019ll be able to influence Joffrey to let Sansa marry Loras and leave King\u2019s Landing for Highgarden.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Joffrey won\u2019t let me leave. He\u2019s got too\nmany reasons to keep me here.</i><br></p><p>Margaery: <i>And only one to let you go. Because it will\nplease me.</i></p></blockquote><p>However, I do think\nthat Margaery is somewhat over-confident here because she doesn\u2019t really know just how much of a monster Joffrey is because Sansa never told the Tyrells that Joffrey didn\u2019t just kill her father and forced her to look at his severed head, but that he also has her publicly beaten by his King\u2019s Guard.</p><p>This scene is immediately followed by a scene where Loras has sex with the squire Olyvar who is also in Baelish\u2019s employ - and Loras lets slip that he is set to marry Sansa. This piece of secret information is subsequently conveyed to Baelish by Olyvar - and therefore Sansa\u2019s new dream is already set to be crushed since Baelish has his own plans for her and that leads him to inform Lord Tywin of the Stark-Tyrell marriage plot.</p><p><b>\u201cI FEEL LIKE I\u2019M IN A DREAM\u201d<br></b></p><p>Margaery is not the only Tyrell who tries to charm Sansa.

In season 2, Theon Greyjoy conquered Winterfell and when Bran and Rickon Stark managed to escape him, he killed a pair of peasant boys to deceive people into thinking that the two Stark boys are dead. Thus, in the eyes of Westeros, Sansa is now Robb Stark\u2019s heir apparent to Winterfell and that makes her a very important piece on the political chessboard. <b>If Robb dies without an heir, Winterfell goes to Sansa and whoever manages to secure her in marriage </b>- and there are several power players who are interested in her: Petyr Baelish, the Lannisters and now the Tyrells who are emerging as a new power in King\u2019s Landing with Margaery set to become Queen, her courting the goodwill of the common folk and her family not only supporting the Lannisters militarily but also feeding the starving populace of King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>In my previous <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">post</a>, I looked at how Olenna and Margaery Tyrell\u2019s initial interest in Sansa was solely motivated by some nasty rumours about Joffrey that worried them as Margaery is set to marry him. However, in episode 4 Lord Varys encourages Olenna Tyrell to take a further interest in Sansa after he learns that Baelish has plans to spirit Sansa away from King\u2019s Landing. Varys approaches Olenna Tyrell and he broaches the idea of a marriage alliance between Sansa Stark and House Tyrell. He says he wants to help Sansa but his main motivation is to keep her out of the hands of Petyr Baelish.\u00a0</p><h2>This is the first time that Sansa is referred to as the <b>Key to the North</b> in the show, but it will not be the last.\u00a0</h2><p>As previously stated, Sansa is Robb\u2019s heir apparent and as such her political value is very high - and Varys seeks to keep the Key to the North out of the hands of Petyr Baelish whom he deems to be one of the most dangerous men of the realm. Thus, Sansa becomes a political pawn in the shadow war between Varys and Baelish, between one who wants to serve the realm and one who only serves himself.</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>COURTED BY THE TYRELLS</b></p><p>The scene between Varys and Olenna is immediately followed by a scene where Margaery seeks out Sansa as she\u2019s praying at a tree stump, the sad remains of\u00a0 Godswood in King\u2019s Landing. The segue between the two scenes makes it clear that Olenna has sent Margaery to charm and befriend Sansa once again since Olenna managed to alienate the girl during their lunch in episode 2, a scene that I covered in my <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">previous post</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/394b52516f8db41632f64619296d20ea/tumblr_inline_pktd37HNsp1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1072\"></figure><p>Margaery approaches and uses her status as the future Queen to send away the Lannister soldiers that guard Sansa so they can have a private\nconversation.</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>What did you pray for?</i></p></blockquote><p>Here\nMargaery whispers to create an atmosphere of intimacy between them.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(smiling): <i>I can\u2019t tell you.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is\nimportant to note that even while Sansa is genuinely friendly here, she doesn\u2019t\nreally trust Margaery. Even when Margaery presses her again on this subject,\nSansa refuses to reveal anything about her personal feelings and hopes. Sansa is understandably wary about the Tyrells after the upsetting luncheon where she found out that they weren\u2019t really interested in being kind to her for her sake but that they only sought out her company because they wanted something from her - and Olenna was pretty aggressive with her. So now Margaery has her work cut out for her.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6b18e71f4f3d8e15831829486514bec/tumblr_inline_pktd2npH7A1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>Margaery tells jokes and\nanecdotes, making Sansa laugh. <b>With these little secrets and inconsequential\nstories from her childhood she creates a sense of intimacy and companionship \u2013\nas if Sansa is indeed a treasured friend, which is something that is incredibly\nenticing for a girl as lonely and abused as Sansa is.</b></p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I want us to be friends.</i></p></blockquote><p>Here the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa, looking at Margaery with an almost incredulous smile on her\nface. <b>She almost can\u2019t believe that anyone would want to be her friend anymore.\nSansa is THAT isolated in King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"237\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/545c608b0eee5d94ad87b56e0150c9ec/tumblr_inline_pkuy6b0uXQ1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"237\"></figure><p>Margaery goes on to paint a very\nattractive image of Highgarden, featuring all the things that Sansa loved\nbefore she came to experience the hard truth beneath the glamour of the\ncapital. When Sansa doubts that Cersei will let her leave King\u2019s Landing,\nMargaery invokes her future status as Queen Consort, implicitly promising that\nshe\u2019ll make sure Sansa can leave King\u2019s Landing after the royal marriage. Then,\nMargaery mentions the real reason for her seeking out Sansa:</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>And if you were to marry my brother Loras\u2026\u00a0</i><i>your place would be at Highgarden,\nwouldn\u2019t it?</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s\nsmile grows bigger as Margery is now offering her an escape from her abusers at\ncourt. But Margaery offers even more than just an escape, she offers the promise of family.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/231e826d5a2363f4fad5d39fb2c8becd/tumblr_inline_pktd3yTdcp1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b851f3187a3f9b75309c06ac7967c95d/tumblr_inline_pktded66RX1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"220\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0a0941759109ee5e3c33f9f451072fd/tumblr_inline_pktdesi5hA1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"220\"></figure><p>This is\nwhere Sansa becomes visibly overwhelmed, smiling through unshed tears as\nMargaery offers not just an escape from her torment but also friendship, family\nand sisterhood - things that Sansa has been without for too long. <b>It is interesting that Margaery uses the same lure as Petyr Baelish: the promise of family. However, Sansa choosing Margaery\u2019s offer doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s abandoning her family. It simply means that she\u2019s choosing the less dangerous option of gaining protection and getting out of King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0</b>Not only is it very dangerous to flee secretly, she has also been explicitly warned about Baelish by a person she trusts (Shae). In contrast, Margaery offers the protection of House Tyrell through marriage and the Tyrells are on the rise. They hold considerable political power as they are feeding King\u2019s Landing and Margaery is set to be Queen. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Tyrells can secure her safety and happiness without exposing her to additional danger - unlike what Baelish offers.</p><p>This scene\nreally highlights Sophie Turner\u2019s stellar acting. She has a wonderfully\nexpressive face and she manages the delicate balance between smiles and tears\nbeautifully. Thus, Margaery successfully cultivates Sansa\u2019s friendship and\ngratitude through a carefully deployed charm. What remains to be seen is\nwhether Margaery\u2019s friendship is a genuine offer.</p><p>In the very next episode we see Sansa and Margaery bonding as they watch Loras at weapon\u2019s training. Once again Margaery assures Sansa that she\u2019ll be able to influence Joffrey to let Sansa marry Loras and leave King\u2019s Landing for Highgarden.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Joffrey won\u2019t let me leave. He\u2019s got too\nmany reasons to keep me here.</i><br></p><p>Margaery: <i>And only one to let you go. Because it will\nplease me.</i></p></blockquote><p>However, I do think\nthat Margaery is somewhat over-confident here because she doesn\u2019t really know just how much of a monster Joffrey is because Sansa never told the Tyrells that Joffrey didn\u2019t just kill her father and forced her to look at his severed head, but that he also has her publicly beaten by his King\u2019s Guard.</p><p>This scene is immediately followed by a scene where Loras has sex with the squire Olyvar who is also in Baelish\u2019s employ - and Loras lets slip that he is set to marry Sansa. This piece of secret information is subsequently conveyed to Baelish by Olyvar - and therefore Sansa\u2019s new dream is already set to be crushed since Baelish has his own plans for her and that leads him to inform Lord Tywin of the Stark-Tyrell marriage plot.</p><p><b>\u201cI FEEL LIKE I\u2019M IN A DREAM\u201d<br></b></p><p>Margaery is not the only Tyrell who tries to charm Sansa. Her brother Loras also courts Sansa, rather awkwardly, in the gardens of the Red Keep in episode 6.\u00a0\n\nThe setting is lush and romantic but their interactions are rather stilted and awkward, mostly because Loras is very uncomfortable whereas Sansa is all happy and soft-eyed. \n\n</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8fec430a1361f642cf15b61b4892a2d9/tumblr_inline_pktdd0gUAm1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"></figure><p><b>For her\nthis betrothal seems like the fulfillment of all her girlish dreams: a handsome\nknight for a husband who understands the codes of chivalric romance </b>- like when he singled her out at the Hand\u2019s Tourney and presented her with a red rose in\u00a0<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">season 1</a>, thus enacting a tableau from the romantic songs that Sansa loves so much.\u00a0\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I feel like I\u2019m in a dream.</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa is,\nas said, all wistful and soft-eyed. <b>This is, in a sense, a return to her\nearlier, girlish self since it seems as though those romantic dreams that she\nonce entertained will come true</b> \u2013 but it is also leavened with the prospect of\na safe harbor from her tormentors as well as the promise of family and\nfriendship that Margaery presented her with.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"629\" data-orig-height=\"372\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fed4bc73620189203e1b2f7052af41c/tumblr_inline_pktdihb7Rv1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"629\" data-orig-height=\"372\"></figure><p>It is a\nscene that I feel very ambiguous about. <b>One the one hand, I think that it is\nimportant that we get to see a hopeful Sansa since it will be so much more\nheartbreaking for us when her hopes are so cruelly crushed.</b> Then there\u2019s the\ncontrast between the lush, romantic setting and Loras\u2019 visible discomfort.\nWhile the betrothal represents both an escape as well as a fulfillment of her\ndreams to Sansa, it represents something very different to Loras since he is\nhomosexual.

In season 2, Theon Greyjoy conquered Winterfell and when Bran and Rickon Stark managed to escape him, he killed a pair of peasant boys to deceive people into thinking that the two Stark boys are dead. Thus, in the eyes of Westeros, Sansa is now Robb Stark&rsquo;s heir apparent to Winterfell and that makes her a very important piece on the political chessboard. <b>If Robb dies without an heir, Winterfell goes to Sansa and whoever manages to secure her in marriage </b>- and there are several power players who are interested in her: Petyr Baelish, the Lannisters and now the Tyrells who are emerging as a new power in King&rsquo;s Landing with Margaery set to become Queen, her courting the goodwill of the common folk and her family not only supporting the Lannisters militarily but also feeding the starving populace of King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><p>In my previous <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">post</a>, I looked at how Olenna and Margaery Tyrell&rsquo;s initial interest in Sansa was solely motivated by some nasty rumours about Joffrey that worried them as Margaery is set to marry him. However, in episode 4 Lord Varys encourages Olenna Tyrell to take a further interest in Sansa after he learns that Baelish has plans to spirit Sansa away from King&rsquo;s Landing. Varys approaches Olenna Tyrell and he broaches the idea of a marriage alliance between Sansa Stark and House Tyrell. He says he wants to help Sansa but his main motivation is to keep her out of the hands of Petyr Baelish.&nbsp;</p><h2>This is the first time that Sansa is referred to as the <b>Key to the North</b> in the show, but it will not be the last.&nbsp;</h2><p>As previously stated, Sansa is Robb&rsquo;s heir apparent and as such her political value is very high - and Varys seeks to keep the Key to the North out of the hands of Petyr Baelish whom he deems to be one of the most dangerous men of the realm. Thus, Sansa becomes a political pawn in the shadow war between Varys and Baelish, between one who wants to serve the realm and one who only serves himself.</p><p><b>COURTED BY THE TYRELLS</b></p><p>The scene between Varys and Olenna is immediately followed by a scene where Margaery seeks out Sansa as she&rsquo;s praying at a tree stump, the sad remains of&nbsp; Godswood in King&rsquo;s Landing. The segue between the two scenes makes it clear that Olenna has sent Margaery to charm and befriend Sansa once again since Olenna managed to alienate the girl during their lunch in episode 2, a scene that I covered in my <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">previous post</a>.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/394b52516f8db41632f64619296d20ea/tumblr_inline_pktd37HNsp1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Margaery approaches and uses her status as the future Queen to send away the Lannister soldiers that guard Sansa so they can have a private\nconversation.</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>What did you pray for?</i></p></blockquote><p>Here\nMargaery whispers to create an atmosphere of intimacy between them.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(smiling): <i>I can&rsquo;t tell you.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is\nimportant to note that even while Sansa is genuinely friendly here, she doesn&rsquo;t\nreally trust Margaery. Even when Margaery presses her again on this subject,\nSansa refuses to reveal anything about her personal feelings and hopes. Sansa is understandably wary about the Tyrells after the upsetting luncheon where she found out that they weren&rsquo;t really interested in being kind to her for her sake but that they only sought out her company because they wanted something from her - and Olenna was pretty aggressive with her. So now Margaery has her work cut out for her.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6b18e71f4f3d8e15831829486514bec/tumblr_inline_pktd2npH7A1uklhai_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Margaery tells jokes and\nanecdotes, making Sansa laugh. <b>With these little secrets and inconsequential\nstories from her childhood she creates a sense of intimacy and companionship &ndash;\nas if Sansa is indeed a treasured friend, which is something that is incredibly\nenticing for a girl as lonely and abused as Sansa is.</b></p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>I want us to be friends.</i></p></blockquote><p>Here the camera cuts to a\nclose-up of Sansa, looking at Margaery with an almost incredulous smile on her\nface. <b>She almost can&rsquo;t believe that anyone would want to be her friend anymore.\nSansa is THAT isolated in King&rsquo;s Landing.&nbsp;</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/545c608b0eee5d94ad87b56e0150c9ec/tumblr_inline_pkuy6b0uXQ1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Margaery goes on to paint a very\nattractive image of Highgarden, featuring all the things that Sansa loved\nbefore she came to experience the hard truth beneath the glamour of the\ncapital. When Sansa doubts that Cersei will let her leave King&rsquo;s Landing,\nMargaery invokes her future status as Queen Consort, implicitly promising that\nshe&rsquo;ll make sure Sansa can leave King&rsquo;s Landing after the royal marriage. Then,\nMargaery mentions the real reason for her seeking out Sansa:</p><blockquote><p>Margaery: <i>And if you were to marry my brother Loras&hellip;&nbsp;</i><i>your place would be at Highgarden,\nwouldn&rsquo;t it?</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa&rsquo;s\nsmile grows bigger as Margery is now offering her an escape from her abusers at\ncourt. But Margaery offers even more than just an escape, she offers the promise of family.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/231e826d5a2363f4fad5d39fb2c8becd/tumblr_inline_pktd3yTdcp1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b851f3187a3f9b75309c06ac7967c95d/tumblr_inline_pktded66RX1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0a0941759109ee5e3c33f9f451072fd/tumblr_inline_pktdesi5hA1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is\nwhere Sansa becomes visibly overwhelmed, smiling through unshed tears as\nMargaery offers not just an escape from her torment but also friendship, family\nand sisterhood - things that Sansa has been without for too long. <b>It is interesting that Margaery uses the same lure as Petyr Baelish: the promise of family. However, Sansa choosing Margaery&rsquo;s offer doesn&rsquo;t mean that she&rsquo;s abandoning her family. It simply means that she&rsquo;s choosing the less dangerous option of gaining protection and getting out of King&rsquo;s Landing.&nbsp;</b>Not only is it very dangerous to flee secretly, she has also been explicitly warned about Baelish by a person she trusts (Shae). In contrast, Margaery offers the protection of House Tyrell through marriage and the Tyrells are on the rise. They hold considerable political power as they are feeding King&rsquo;s Landing and Margaery is set to be Queen. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Tyrells can secure her safety and happiness without exposing her to additional danger - unlike what Baelish offers.</p><p>This scene\nreally highlights Sophie Turner&rsquo;s stellar acting. She has a wonderfully\nexpressive face and she manages the delicate balance between smiles and tears\nbeautifully. Thus, Margaery successfully cultivates Sansa&rsquo;s friendship and\ngratitude through a carefully deployed charm. What remains to be seen is\nwhether Margaery&rsquo;s friendship is a genuine offer.</p><p>In the very next episode we see Sansa and Margaery bonding as they watch Loras at weapon&rsquo;s training. Once again Margaery assures Sansa that she&rsquo;ll be able to influence Joffrey to let Sansa marry Loras and leave King&rsquo;s Landing for Highgarden.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Joffrey won&rsquo;t let me leave. He&rsquo;s got too\nmany reasons to keep me here.</i><br /></p><p>Margaery: <i>And only one to let you go. Because it will\nplease me.</i></p></blockquote><p>However, I do think\nthat Margaery is somewhat over-confident here because she doesn&rsquo;t really know just how much of a monster Joffrey is because Sansa never told the Tyrells that Joffrey didn&rsquo;t just kill her father and forced her to look at his severed head, but that he also has her publicly beaten by his King&rsquo;s Guard.</p><p>This scene is immediately followed by a scene where Loras has sex with the squire Olyvar who is also in Baelish&rsquo;s employ - and Loras lets slip that he is set to marry Sansa. This piece of secret information is subsequently conveyed to Baelish by Olyvar - and therefore Sansa&rsquo;s new dream is already set to be crushed since Baelish has his own plans for her and that leads him to inform Lord Tywin of the Stark-Tyrell marriage plot.</p><p><b>&ldquo;I FEEL LIKE I&rsquo;M IN A DREAM&rdquo;<br /></b></p><p>Margaery is not the only Tyrell who tries to charm Sansa. Her brother Loras also courts Sansa, rather awkwardly, in the gardens of the Red Keep in episode 6.&nbsp;\n\nThe setting is lush and romantic but their interactions are rather stilted and awkward, mostly because Loras is very uncomfortable whereas Sansa is all happy and soft-eyed. \n\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8fec430a1361f642cf15b61b4892a2d9/tumblr_inline_pktdd0gUAm1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>For her\nthis betrothal seems like the fulfillment of all her girlish dreams: a handsome\nknight for a husband who understands the codes of chivalric romance </b>- like when he singled her out at the Hand&rsquo;s Tourney and presented her with a red rose in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">season 1</a>, thus enacting a tableau from the romantic songs that Sansa loves so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>I feel like I&rsquo;m in a dream.</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa is,\nas said, all wistful and soft-eyed. <b>This is, in a sense, a return to her\nearlier, girlish self since it seems as though those romantic dreams that she\nonce entertained will come true</b> &ndash; but it is also leavened with the prospect of\na safe harbor from her tormentors as well as the promise of family and\nfriendship that Margaery presented her with.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fed4bc73620189203e1b2f7052af41c/tumblr_inline_pktdihb7Rv1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It is a\nscene that I feel very ambiguous about. <b>One the one hand, I think that it is\nimportant that we get to see a hopeful Sansa since it will be so much more\nheartbreaking for us when her hopes are so cruelly crushed.</b> Then there&rsquo;s the\ncontrast between the lush, romantic setting and Loras&rsquo; visible discomfort.\nWhile the betrothal represents both an escape as well as a fulfillment of her\ndreams to Sansa, it represents something very different to Loras since he is\nhomosexual.

You saved my life, Theon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout me you wouldn\u2019t have been in danger in the first place.\u201d Theon still didn\u2019t look up and Sansa rolled her eyes. </p><p>In a way she appreciated Theon taking responsibility for what he had done, but he didn\u2019t have to blame everything that had happened to her on him. </p><p>He had not been the one beheading her father. He had not been the one throwing her aside when she had become useless. He had not been the one rescuing her only to give her away to a far worse monster. He had not been the one raping her.</p><p>\u201cI was already in danger long before you ditched my brother.\u201d Sansa let out a deep sigh. \u201cYou made a lot of mistakes, Theon. But what happened to me wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t conquered Winterfell, Robb wouldn\u2019t have had Roose Bolton send Ramsay and you\u2026\u201d Theon looked up and his eyes, filled with tears, met hers. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have had to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled a mocking smile. \u201cAs if Peter wouldn\u2019t have found me another monster to marry.\u201d </p><p>Maybe Peter would have kept her for himself and would have forced her to marry him.</p><p>She had to swallow a few times to keep herself from puking all over the books at her feet. \u201cI was already way too deep into this mess to come out of it unscratched.

And we all learned from it.\u201d She stared at the books again. \u201cI learned not to wait for a knight in shining armor or a prince charming.\u201d She wanted to walk past Theon, but Theon grabbed her arm and pulled her back.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Theon paused and Sansa debated whether to free her arm and walk away or to be patient. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about fairytales, but\u2026\u201d He hesitated once more. \u201cMaybe you just haven\u2019t reached the end of yours yet? Doesn\u2019t it always get worse before it gets better?\u201d</p><p>Sansa thought about that for a moment. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re enslaved, banished, almost killed, cursed\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa thought about Snow White, about Sleeping Beauty, about Cinderella and Rapunzel. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t say you should wait for a prince or knight to rescue you. You can totally rescue yourself, but\u2026\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI think you haven\u2019t reached the end of your tale yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if any noble knight or prince is ever gonna marry me after\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t say it. She doubted if she would ever be capable of saying it out loud. \u201cAfter everything that has happened. I married two times already, Theon. And my last marriage\u2026\u201d She almost choked and eventually she swallowed the rest of her sentence.</p><p>\u201cDoes it really have to be a prince?\u201d Theon looked at her and when their eyes met she saw something new in them. </p><p>She saw a small sliver of hope. </p><p>\u201cI know I don\u2019t have anything to offer.\u201d He kept his glance locked with hers and when she didn\u2019t run away screaming she saw the sliver of hope grow. \u201cAnd I have a lot of mistakes to make up for and flaws I need to work on and\u2026\u201d He eventually looked away from her. \u201cI guess I need a princess in shining armor to save me too, but\u2026\u201d He looked back at her and Sansa felt her heart skipping a beat in her chest. \u201cMaybe I can be your knight and you can be my princess and we can help each other to save ourselves? We can take it slowly of course. But, maybe it could be a start to know we\u2019re not doing this alone and we don\u2019t have to end up alone.\u201d Theon cocked his head. \u201cMaybe, we can be each other\u2019s happy ending?\u201d</p><p>Sansa opened her mouth to say no, to dismiss the offer without even thinking about it, but for some reason she couldn\u2019t. The word just didn\u2019t want to come out. \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d She said instead. \u201cMaybe I like that indeed.\u201d</p>",

However, <a href=\"https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Balticon_Report\">he was very annoyed that the letter was released to the public</a>, as it was intended for him and his publisher only. He said that in the outline he was \u201cmaking shit up\u201d and \u201ccharacters changed along the way\u201d. And notably, when asked about the fates of the \u201cmain five\u201d, <i>he also included Sansa</i>: \u201cTyrion, Arya, Jon, Sansa, you know, all of the Stark kids, and the major Lannisters, yeah.\u201d</li><li><a href=\"https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1348\">\u201c[We] mentioned to George that some people gave Sansa and Catelyn a lot of grief, claiming they \u201cwhined\u201d too much. George was quite adamant that he disagreed with those readers.\u201d</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1017\">\u201c\u2026\n it is not a case of all or nothing. No single person is to blame for \nNed\u2019s downfall. Sansa played a role, certainly, but it would be unfair \nto put all the blame on her.

My interest is in trying to make them real and human. If I can create\n a fully-fleshed three-dimensional character, some of my readers will \nlike him/her, or some won\u2019t, and that\u2019s fine with me. That\u2019s the way \nreal people react to real people in the real world, after all. Look at \nthe range of opinions we get on politicans and movie stars. If EVERYONE\n likes a certain character, or hates him, that probably means he\u2019s made \nof cardboard. So I will let my readers decide who they like, admire, \nhate, pity, sympathize with, etc. The fact that characters like Sansa, \nCatelyn, Jaime, and Theon provoke such a wide range of reactions \nsuggests to me that I have achieved my goal in making them human.\u201d (<a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/30899231180/q-it-seems-as-if-the-introduction-of-viewpoint\">source</a>)</li></ul><p>So, yes\u2026 Sansa may be a divisive character in the fandom\u2026 but that just means that GRRM thinks she\u2019s more fully human character than a less-divisive one. Which I think is a good thing. :D\u00a0\u00a0 I hope this helps you, my dear Sansa anon, at least a little bit, and please feel free to use my submit box if you want to reply \nanonymously while my inbox is closed, no worries about the guidelines \nthere.\n\n<br/></p>",
