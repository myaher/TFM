Cyrus knew he didn\u2019t mean any of what he was saying, but his mind was stuck in a storm and there was no getting out.</p><p>\u201cYou can be so infuriating sometimes, Cyrus,\u201d TJ yelled, wildly running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cOh really? How come?\u201d Cyrus hissed, glaring at TJ.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? All past year, I\u2019ve been so patient, and understanding, never asking why you would just up and leave in between dates or hanging out, trying to not let it upset me. But you never said why, you just kept doing it. And it sucked. But what sucked more is you never said a word. You always just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? It\u2019s just, I,\u201d Cyrus stammered, unable to find the words. How was he supposed to tell TJ about his nervousness about soulmates and the numbers and letters printed on his shoulder, without sounding\u00a0paranoid?</p><p>TJ just turned away from Cyrus, pinching the bridge of his nose, leaning against the kitchen counter in his house. He took a deep breath but kept his head down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, grabbing his phone from the table. TJ scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious right now? You\u2019re literally doing the same\u00a0thing again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just have to go,\u201d Cyrus started, his tone pleading.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Cyrus? Why can\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t! Okay? I can\u2019t tell you!\u201d Cyrus yelled, the tears filling up in his eyes, as he moved to the door. He grabbed his coat and left TJ\u2019s house, the cold air of winter hitting him in the face as soon as he walked out. All he heard was TJ\u2019s sigh as he shut the door behind him.</p><p>As he walked away from the house, Cyrus let the tears fall. This had been their worst fight yet. They didn\u2019t fight very often, only irrelevant arguments every now and then. But this one seemed different. And despite how much it hurt, Cyrus knew that it was warranted in some sense. He had been so caught up in his fear of TJ being his soulmate that he had not considered how TJ would be feeling with him leaving abruptly almost every time they hung out.</p><p><i>Were they still together? </i>Cyrus asked himself as he made his way to the Spoon. He really hoped they were, and that this was just another obstacle they would get over. But for some reason, he felt unsure. And that just left a weird feeling in his gut. He shook his head slightly as he pushed open the door of the Spoon, just wanting to settle down with some baby taters and a milkshake.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cyrus! Hey,\u201d a voice said from behind him, and Cyrus turned to see Walker sitting in a booth, waving him over. Cyrus rubbed his nose, which was quite red, and smiled back, heading over to him.</p><p>\u201cHey Walker,\u201d Cyrus said, sliding into the seat opposite to him. Walker furrowed his eyebrows, looking at Cyrus in concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, bro? You look hassled.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just waved him off, sniffing. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just, cold and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t look convinced, but nodded his head anyway, as the waitress set down their food. They spent the next half an hour just talking about nothing in particular, Cyrus starting to feel a bit better about things. He hadn\u2019t really spoken much to Walker before, what with all the drama involving\u00a0him, Andi, Jonah and Buffy. It was a big mess that Cyrus wanted no part of. But, as he kept talking to him, Cyrus realised that they actually got on pretty well. If things were different, they could have been really good friends.</p><p>All the while they were at the Spoon, Cyrus itched to check his phone, desperate to see if TJ had texted him, said anything. At various points, he caved and checked, but the notifications were blank. He tapped his fingers against the table repeatedly, his underlying nervousness growing. Walker wasn\u2019t blind, he picked up on his actions soon enough, and finally, he grabbed Cyrus\u2019 hand, forcing him to stop tapping.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure everything is okay, Cyrus?\u201d Walker asked, looking Cyrus in the eye. Cyrus forced himself to look back at Walker, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cTJ and I got into a huge fight before this,\u201d Cyrus said with a sigh, looking at the empty baby tater basket before him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if we will still be okay.\u201d</p><p>Walker shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that. Your friendship is strong enough to last anything.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave a short, emotionless laugh. \u201cFriendship, maybe. But a relationship is different, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Walker looked confused at first, but then realisation flooded his face, as he leaned back in his seat. \u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know you guys were-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus interrupted, holding up his hand. \u201cI know what you meant.\u201d</p><p>Walker nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys will be okay.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, taking the opportunity to check his phone again. Still nothing.</p><p>There was an awkward silence between them until Walker snapped his fingers. \u201cOh! I wanted to tell you. There\u2019s an art exhibition tomorrow, and one of my paintings is gonna be there as one of the featured artist works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Walker, that\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d Cyrus said, smiling as he bumped fists with him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. Anyway, I\u2019d love it if you could come by and see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cyrus asked. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Walker shrugged. \u201cI still haven\u2019t told Andi or anyone, so you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve told.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, taking the flyer which Walker had passed over to him. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Walker replied, smiling warmly. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus bumped fists with him again as he slid out of the booth seat. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus walked home, the temporary happiness from hanging out with Walker wearing out. He appreciated Walker trying to make him feel better, and it had worked for a bit. But after he left, he looked back at his blank phone screen, the worry setting in. Logic dictated that he should call TJ and talk this out. But when had his logical side ever won against the side holding irrational fear?</p><p>Cyrus walked back to his room, throwing his coat on his bed. When he did so, he caught a fleeting glimpse at his watch.</p><p><i>6:17 pm.</i></p><p>Cyrus sighed, heading over to the bathroom. He knew there was no real reason for him to check, he hadn\u2019t been around TJ at the time on his shoulder, but old habits die hard. He pulled down the collar of his shirt, his gaze sliding over, but he did a double take and gasped.</p><p>Grey.</p><p><i>What? How? Who could it have been? Only people he had\u00a0</i><i>spoken to were TJ and\u2026</i></p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>As if he was stuck in slow motion, Cyrus picked up his phone and shakily clicked on Walker\u2019s contact, typing out a \u2018hi\u2019. Holding his breath, he pressed \u2018Send\u2019.</p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p>Cyrus gasped, dropping his phone onto the bed, covering his mouth in shock. He hastily typed out many more messages, checking if it wasn\u2019t just a fluke.</p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>. </i></b></p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p>Cyrus felt tears prick his eyes, but they weren\u2019t of sadness. Of course, he felt a dull pang of pain, knowing he would never get to talk to Walker again. He really had a great time with him that day, but in the end, they just didn\u2019t know each other well enough. He would miss a friend, though.</p><p>But\u2026</p><p><i>TJ wasn\u2019t his soulmate.</i></p><p>That realisation hit Cyrus like a ton of bricks. In the best way possible. <i>TJ wasn\u2019t his soulmate. He wouldn\u2019t lose him. He didn\u2019t need\u00a0</i><i>to be scared anymore. He didn\u2019t need to be scared.</i></p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus whispered, as he left his coat and bolted out of his room, down the stairs, out of the doors, into the streets as the sky began to grow darker. Under the darkening sky, Cyrus ran. He ran a record distance for him, all the way trying to call TJ, but receiving no answer.</p><p>He reached TJ\u2019s house, but he didn\u2019t knock. Instead, he went to the side of the house, and climbed up to TJ\u2019s window, from where he could see the light on, and a figure walking around the room. He had only climbed up to TJ\u2019s window once, and it had almost ended in a trip to the emergency room. But desperate times called for desperate measures. Cyrus made his way up the drain pipe, very nearly falling off at least 5 times. But eventually, he made it up, rapping his knuckles on TJ\u2019s window, catching his breath after the unbelievable amount of exercise he had done.</p><p>He saw TJ pace about his room, his eyes visibly red. At Cyrus\u2019 knocking, he turned around abruptly, his jaw dropping to the floor as he walked up to the window to open it.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, what are you,\u201d TJ started but was cut off by Cyrus pulling him in for a kiss, wrapping his arms around his neck, pulling TJ as close as he could. TJ was knocked back in shock, but soon enough wrapped his hands around Cyrus\u2019 waist, melting into his touch. Cyrus pulled away, but grabbed TJ\u2019s face, kissing it all over, whispering, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d over and over.</p><p>\u201cHey hey,\u201d TJ said, moving Cyrus back so he could look him in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cy. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for hurting you TJ,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, his face red, a stray tear falling down his cheek. \u201cI was so scared of possibly losing you, that I just forgot everything else. And I didn\u2019t realise how I was hurting your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d TJ whispered, pushing Cyrus\u2019 hair back, trying to hold the tears back himself. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sorry too. I said some awful things too. But I told you, you won\u2019t lose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now,\u201d Cyrus said, looking at TJ with a bright smile of relief.</p><p>It took TJ a minute to understand what Cyrus meant, but soon he realised. And he grabbed Cyrus and hugged him tight, spinning him around his room, kissing his cheek, his forehead, his lips. He had never felt more relief in his life.</p><p>\u201cWe must be the first losers to be so happy that we aren\u2019t soulmates,\u201d Cyrus laughed, bumping his nose with TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we okay?\u201d TJ asked nervously, looking at Cyrus.\n</p><p>Cyrus just smiled, and pulled TJ in for a kiss, nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are. Of course we are.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that, hugging and kissing, high on a different level of happiness. After a while, TJ turned over to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the universe says,\u201d he whispered, holding Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cBut you are the best person for me, Cyrus Goodman.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, kissing the tip of TJ\u2019s nose. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the best person for me, TJ Kippen.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Hope that was okay lol</b></p><p><b>Send me prompts cuz im uninspired and I\u2019ll do them in a few days!</b></p>",

Walker wasn\u2019t blind, he picked up on his actions soon enough, and finally, he grabbed Cyrus\u2019 hand, forcing him to stop tapping.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure everything is okay, Cyrus?\u201d Walker asked, looking Cyrus in the eye. Cyrus forced himself to look back at Walker, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cTJ and I got into a huge fight before this,\u201d Cyrus said with a sigh, looking at the empty baby tater basket before him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if we will still be okay.\u201d</p><p>Walker shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that. Your friendship is strong enough to last anything.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave a short, emotionless laugh. \u201cFriendship, maybe. But a relationship is different, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Walker looked confused at first, but then realisation flooded his face, as he leaned back in his seat. \u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know you guys were-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus interrupted, holding up his hand. \u201cI know what you meant.\u201d</p><p>Walker nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys will be okay.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed, taking the opportunity to check his phone again. Still nothing.</p><p>There was an awkward silence between them until Walker snapped his fingers. \u201cOh! I wanted to tell you. There\u2019s an art exhibition tomorrow, and one of my paintings is gonna be there as one of the featured artist works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Walker, that\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d Cyrus said, smiling as he bumped fists with him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. Anyway, I\u2019d love it if you could come by and see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cyrus asked. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Walker shrugged. \u201cI still haven\u2019t told Andi or anyone, so you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve told.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, taking the flyer which Walker had passed over to him. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Walker replied, smiling warmly. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus bumped fists with him again as he slid out of the booth seat. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus walked home, the temporary happiness from hanging out with Walker wearing out. He appreciated Walker trying to make him feel better, and it had worked for a bit. But after he left, he looked back at his blank phone screen, the worry setting in. Logic dictated that he should call TJ and talk this out. But when had his logical side ever won against the side holding irrational fear?</p><p>Cyrus walked back to his room, throwing his coat on his bed. When he did so, he caught a fleeting glimpse at his watch.</p><p><i>6:17 pm.</i></p><p>Cyrus sighed, heading over to the bathroom. He knew there was no real reason for him to check, he hadn\u2019t been around TJ at the time on his shoulder, but old habits die hard. He pulled down the collar of his shirt, his gaze sliding over, but he did a double take and gasped.</p><p>Grey.</p><p><i>What? How? Who could it have been? Only people he had\u00a0</i><i>spoken to were TJ and\u2026</i></p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>As if he was stuck in slow motion, Cyrus picked up his phone and shakily clicked on Walker\u2019s contact, typing out a \u2018hi\u2019. Holding his breath, he pressed \u2018Send\u2019.</p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p>Cyrus gasped, dropping his phone onto the bed, covering his mouth in shock. He hastily typed out many more messages, checking if it wasn\u2019t just a fluke.</p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>. </i></b></p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p>Cyrus felt tears prick his eyes, but they weren\u2019t of sadness. Of course, he felt a dull pang of pain, knowing he would never get to talk to Walker again. He really had a great time with him that day, but in the end, they just didn\u2019t know each other well enough. He would miss a friend, though.</p><p>But\u2026</p><p><i>TJ wasn\u2019t his soulmate.</i></p><p>That realisation hit Cyrus like a ton of bricks. In the best way possible. <i>TJ wasn\u2019t his soulmate. He wouldn\u2019t lose him. He didn\u2019t need\u00a0</i><i>to be scared anymore. He didn\u2019t need to be scared.</i></p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus whispered, as he left his coat and bolted out of his room, down the stairs, out of the doors, into the streets as the sky began to grow darker. Under the darkening sky, Cyrus ran. He ran a record distance for him, all the way trying to call TJ, but receiving no answer.</p><p>He reached TJ\u2019s house, but he didn\u2019t knock. Instead, he went to the side of the house, and climbed up to TJ\u2019s window, from where he could see the light on, and a figure walking around the room. He had only climbed up to TJ\u2019s window once, and it had almost ended in a trip to the emergency room. But desperate times called for desperate measures. Cyrus made his way up the drain pipe, very nearly falling off at least 5 times. But eventually, he made it up, rapping his knuckles on TJ\u2019s window, catching his breath after the unbelievable amount of exercise he had done.</p><p>He saw TJ pace about his room, his eyes visibly red. At Cyrus\u2019 knocking, he turned around abruptly, his jaw dropping to the floor as he walked up to the window to open it.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, what are you,\u201d TJ started but was cut off by Cyrus pulling him in for a kiss, wrapping his arms around his neck, pulling TJ as close as he could. TJ was knocked back in shock, but soon enough wrapped his hands around Cyrus\u2019 waist, melting into his touch. Cyrus pulled away, but grabbed TJ\u2019s face, kissing it all over, whispering, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d over and over.</p><p>\u201cHey hey,\u201d TJ said, moving Cyrus back so he could look him in the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cy. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for hurting you TJ,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, his face red, a stray tear falling down his cheek. \u201cI was so scared of possibly losing you, that I just forgot everything else. And I didn\u2019t realise how I was hurting your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d TJ whispered, pushing Cyrus\u2019 hair back, trying to hold the tears back himself. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sorry too. I said some awful things too. But I told you, you won\u2019t lose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now,\u201d Cyrus said, looking at TJ with a bright smile of relief.</p><p>It took TJ a minute to understand what Cyrus meant, but soon he realised. And he grabbed Cyrus and hugged him tight, spinning him around his room, kissing his cheek, his forehead, his lips. He had never felt more relief in his life.</p><p>\u201cWe must be the first losers to be so happy that we aren\u2019t soulmates,\u201d Cyrus laughed, bumping his nose with TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we okay?\u201d TJ asked nervously, looking at Cyrus.\n</p><p>Cyrus just smiled, and pulled TJ in for a kiss, nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are. Of course we are.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that, hugging and kissing, high on a different level of happiness. After a while, TJ turned over to Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the universe says,\u201d he whispered, holding Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cBut you are the best person for me, Cyrus Goodman.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, kissing the tip of TJ\u2019s nose. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the best person for me, TJ Kippen.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Hope that was okay lol</b></p><p><b>Send me prompts cuz im uninspired and I\u2019ll do them in a few days!</b></p>",

To recap: the chapter ends with them finally confessing and kissing dramatically in the rain, but Cyrus confessed his fear of losing TJ if he is his soulmate, but TJ reassures him it\u2019ll be okay. But he\u2019s still scared.\u00a0</i></p><p><b><i>LINKS IN REBLOG\u00a0</i></b></p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><b><i>With or Without You - U2</i></b></p><p>Cyrus wished, at that moment, that he had never met TJ. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t even sure what the argument had started about, but now they were fully yelling in each other\u2019s faces, hurling insult after insult at each other. Cyrus knew he didn\u2019t mean any of what he was saying, but his mind was stuck in a storm and there was no getting out.</p><p>\u201cYou can be so infuriating sometimes, Cyrus,\u201d TJ yelled, wildly running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cOh really? How come?\u201d Cyrus hissed, glaring at TJ.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? All past year, I\u2019ve been so patient, and understanding, never asking why you would just up and leave in between dates or hanging out, trying to not let it upset me. But you never said why, you just kept doing it. And it sucked. But what sucked more is you never said a word. You always just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? It\u2019s just, I,\u201d Cyrus stammered, unable to find the words. How was he supposed to tell TJ about his nervousness about soulmates and the numbers and letters printed on his shoulder, without sounding\u00a0paranoid?</p><p>TJ just turned away from Cyrus, pinching the bridge of his nose, leaning against the kitchen counter in his house. He took a deep breath but kept his head down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, grabbing his phone from the table. TJ scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious right now? You\u2019re literally doing the same\u00a0thing again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just have to go,\u201d Cyrus started, his tone pleading.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Cyrus? Why can\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t! Okay? I can\u2019t tell you!\u201d Cyrus yelled, the tears filling up in his eyes, as he moved to the door. He grabbed his coat and left TJ\u2019s house, the cold air of winter hitting him in the face as soon as he walked out. All he heard was TJ\u2019s sigh as he shut the door behind him.</p><p>As he walked away from the house, Cyrus let the tears fall. This had been their worst fight yet. They didn\u2019t fight very often, only irrelevant arguments every now and then. But this one seemed different. And despite how much it hurt, Cyrus knew that it was warranted in some sense. He had been so caught up in his fear of TJ being his soulmate that he had not considered how TJ would be feeling with him leaving abruptly almost every time they hung out.</p><p><i>Were they still together? </i>Cyrus asked himself as he made his way to the Spoon. He really hoped they were, and that this was just another obstacle they would get over. But for some reason, he felt unsure. And that just left a weird feeling in his gut. He shook his head slightly as he pushed open the door of the Spoon, just wanting to settle down with some baby taters and a milkshake.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cyrus! Hey,\u201d a voice said from behind him, and Cyrus turned to see Walker sitting in a booth, waving him over. Cyrus rubbed his nose, which was quite red, and smiled back, heading over to him.</p><p>\u201cHey Walker,\u201d Cyrus said, sliding into the seat opposite to him. Walker furrowed his eyebrows, looking at Cyrus in concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, bro? You look hassled.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just waved him off, sniffing. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just, cold and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t look convinced, but nodded his head anyway, as the waitress set down their food. They spent the next half an hour just talking about nothing in particular, Cyrus starting to feel a bit better about things. He hadn\u2019t really spoken much to Walker before, what with all the drama involving\u00a0him, Andi, Jonah and Buffy. It was a big mess that Cyrus wanted no part of. But, as he kept talking to him, Cyrus realised that they actually got on pretty well. If things were different, they could have been really good friends.</p><p>All the while they were at the Spoon, Cyrus itched to check his phone, desperate to see if TJ had texted him, said anything. At various points, he caved and checked, but the notifications were blank. He tapped his fingers against the table repeatedly, his underlying nervousness growing.

But he&rsquo;s still scared.&nbsp;</i></p><p><b><i>LINKS IN REBLOG&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><b><i>With or Without You - U2</i></b></p><p>Cyrus wished, at that moment, that he had never met TJ. </p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t even sure what the argument had started about, but now they were fully yelling in each other&rsquo;s faces, hurling insult after insult at each other. Cyrus knew he didn&rsquo;t mean any of what he was saying, but his mind was stuck in a storm and there was no getting out.</p><p>&ldquo;You can be so infuriating sometimes, Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ yelled, wildly running his fingers through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really? How come?&rdquo; Cyrus hissed, glaring at TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious? All past year, I&rsquo;ve been so patient, and understanding, never asking why you would just up and leave in between dates or hanging out, trying to not let it upset me. But you never said why, you just kept doing it. And it sucked. But what sucked more is you never said a word. You always just left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay? It&rsquo;s just, I,&rdquo; Cyrus stammered, unable to find the words. How was he supposed to tell TJ about his nervousness about soulmates and the numbers and letters printed on his shoulder, without sounding&nbsp;paranoid?</p><p>TJ just turned away from Cyrus, pinching the bridge of his nose, leaning against the kitchen counter in his house. He took a deep breath but kept his head down.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, grabbing his phone from the table. TJ scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious right now? You&rsquo;re literally doing the same&nbsp;thing again!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just have to go,&rdquo; Cyrus started, his tone pleading.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, Cyrus? Why can&rsquo;t you just tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! Okay? I can&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo; Cyrus yelled, the tears filling up in his eyes, as he moved to the door. He grabbed his coat and left TJ&rsquo;s house, the cold air of winter hitting him in the face as soon as he walked out. All he heard was TJ&rsquo;s sigh as he shut the door behind him.</p><p>As he walked away from the house, Cyrus let the tears fall. This had been their worst fight yet. They didn&rsquo;t fight very often, only irrelevant arguments every now and then. But this one seemed different. And despite how much it hurt, Cyrus knew that it was warranted in some sense. He had been so caught up in his fear of TJ being his soulmate that he had not considered how TJ would be feeling with him leaving abruptly almost every time they hung out.</p><p><i>Were they still together? </i>Cyrus asked himself as he made his way to the Spoon. He really hoped they were, and that this was just another obstacle they would get over. But for some reason, he felt unsure. And that just left a weird feeling in his gut. He shook his head slightly as he pushed open the door of the Spoon, just wanting to settle down with some baby taters and a milkshake.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Cyrus! Hey,&rdquo; a voice said from behind him, and Cyrus turned to see Walker sitting in a booth, waving him over. Cyrus rubbed his nose, which was quite red, and smiled back, heading over to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Walker,&rdquo; Cyrus said, sliding into the seat opposite to him. Walker furrowed his eyebrows, looking at Cyrus in concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, bro? You look hassled.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just waved him off, sniffing. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine. Just, cold and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Walker didn&rsquo;t look convinced, but nodded his head anyway, as the waitress set down their food. They spent the next half an hour just talking about nothing in particular, Cyrus starting to feel a bit better about things. He hadn&rsquo;t really spoken much to Walker before, what with all the drama involving&nbsp;him, Andi, Jonah and Buffy. It was a big mess that Cyrus wanted no part of. But, as he kept talking to him, Cyrus realised that they actually got on pretty well. If things were different, they could have been really good friends.</p><p>All the while they were at the Spoon, Cyrus itched to check his phone, desperate to see if TJ had texted him, said anything. At various points, he caved and checked, but the notifications were blank. He tapped his fingers against the table repeatedly, his underlying nervousness growing. Walker wasn&rsquo;t blind, he picked up on his actions soon enough, and finally, he grabbed Cyrus&rsquo; hand, forcing him to stop tapping.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure everything is okay, Cyrus?&rdquo; Walker asked, looking Cyrus in the eye. Cyrus forced himself to look back at Walker, taking a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ and I got into a huge fight before this,&rdquo; Cyrus said with a sigh, looking at the empty baby tater basket before him. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know if we will still be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Walker shook his head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about that. Your friendship is strong enough to last anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gave a short, emotionless laugh. &ldquo;Friendship, maybe. But a relationship is different, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Walker looked confused at first, but then realisation flooded his face, as he leaned back in his seat. &ldquo;Oh. I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t know you guys were-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Cyrus interrupted, holding up his hand. &ldquo;I know what you meant.&rdquo;</p><p>Walker nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you guys will be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed, taking the opportunity to check his phone again. Still nothing.</p><p>There was an awkward silence between them until Walker snapped his fingers. &ldquo;Oh! I wanted to tell you. There&rsquo;s an art exhibition tomorrow, and one of my paintings is gonna be there as one of the featured artist works.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, Walker, that&rsquo;s amazing. I&rsquo;m so happy for you,&rdquo; Cyrus said, smiling as he bumped fists with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, man. Anyway, I&rsquo;d love it if you could come by and see it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Cyrus asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Walker shrugged. &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t told Andi or anyone, so you&rsquo;re the first person I&rsquo;ve told.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, taking the flyer which Walker had passed over to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try my best to make it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; Walker replied, smiling warmly. &ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus bumped fists with him again as he slid out of the booth seat. &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Cyrus walked home, the temporary happiness from hanging out with Walker wearing out. He appreciated Walker trying to make him feel better, and it had worked for a bit. But after he left, he looked back at his blank phone screen, the worry setting in. Logic dictated that he should call TJ and talk this out. But when had his logical side ever won against the side holding irrational fear?</p><p>Cyrus walked back to his room, throwing his coat on his bed. When he did so, he caught a fleeting glimpse at his watch.</p><p><i>6:17 pm.</i></p><p>Cyrus sighed, heading over to the bathroom. He knew there was no real reason for him to check, he hadn&rsquo;t been around TJ at the time on his shoulder, but old habits die hard. He pulled down the collar of his shirt, his gaze sliding over, but he did a double take and gasped.</p><p>Grey.</p><p><i>What? How? Who could it have been? Only people he had&nbsp;</i><i>spoken to were TJ and&hellip;</i></p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>As if he was stuck in slow motion, Cyrus picked up his phone and shakily clicked on Walker&rsquo;s contact, typing out a &lsquo;hi&rsquo;. Holding his breath, he pressed &lsquo;Send&rsquo;.</p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p>Cyrus gasped, dropping his phone onto the bed, covering his mouth in shock. He hastily typed out many more messages, checking if it wasn&rsquo;t just a fluke.</p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>. </i></b></p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p><b>This message could not be delivered<i>.</i></b></p><p>Cyrus felt tears prick his eyes, but they weren&rsquo;t of sadness. Of course, he felt a dull pang of pain, knowing he would never get to talk to Walker again. He really had a great time with him that day, but in the end, they just didn&rsquo;t know each other well enough. He would miss a friend, though.</p><p>But&hellip;</p><p><i>TJ wasn&rsquo;t his soulmate.</i></p><p>That realisation hit Cyrus like a ton of bricks. In the best way possible. <i>TJ wasn&rsquo;t his soulmate. He wouldn&rsquo;t lose him. He didn&rsquo;t need&nbsp;</i><i>to be scared anymore. He didn&rsquo;t need to be scared.</i></p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus whispered, as he left his coat and bolted out of his room, down the stairs, out of the doors, into the streets as the sky began to grow darker. Under the darkening sky, Cyrus ran. He ran a record distance for him, all the way trying to call TJ, but receiving no answer.</p><p>He reached TJ&rsquo;s house, but he didn&rsquo;t knock. Instead, he went to the side of the house, and climbed up to TJ&rsquo;s window, from where he could see the light on, and a figure walking around the room. He had only climbed up to TJ&rsquo;s window once, and it had almost ended in a trip to the emergency room. But desperate times called for desperate measures. Cyrus made his way up the drain pipe, very nearly falling off at least 5 times. But eventually, he made it up, rapping his knuckles on TJ&rsquo;s window, catching his breath after the unbelievable amount of exercise he had done.</p><p>He saw TJ pace about his room, his eyes visibly red. At Cyrus&rsquo; knocking, he turned around abruptly, his jaw dropping to the floor as he walked up to the window to open it.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, what are you,&rdquo; TJ started but was cut off by Cyrus pulling him in for a kiss, wrapping his arms around his neck, pulling TJ as close as he could. TJ was knocked back in shock, but soon enough wrapped his hands around Cyrus&rsquo; waist, melting into his touch. Cyrus pulled away, but grabbed TJ&rsquo;s face, kissing it all over, whispering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; over and over.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey hey,&rdquo; TJ said, moving Cyrus back so he could look him in the eye. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Cy. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for hurting you TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, his face red, a stray tear falling down his cheek. &ldquo;I was so scared of possibly losing you, that I just forgot everything else. And I didn&rsquo;t realise how I was hurting your feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ whispered, pushing Cyrus&rsquo; hair back, trying to hold the tears back himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m sorry too. I said some awful things too. But I told you, you won&rsquo;t lose me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that now,&rdquo; Cyrus said, looking at TJ with a bright smile of relief.</p><p>It took TJ a minute to understand what Cyrus meant, but soon he realised. And he grabbed Cyrus and hugged him tight, spinning him around his room, kissing his cheek, his forehead, his lips. He had never felt more relief in his life.</p><p>&ldquo;We must be the first losers to be so happy that we aren&rsquo;t soulmates,&rdquo; Cyrus laughed, bumping his nose with TJ&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;So, are we okay?&rdquo; TJ asked nervously, looking at Cyrus.\n</p><p>Cyrus just smiled, and pulled TJ in for a kiss, nodding his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we are. Of course we are.&rdquo;</p><p>They stayed like that, hugging and kissing, high on a different level of happiness. After a while, TJ turned over to Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the universe says,&rdquo; he whispered, holding Cyrus&rsquo; hand. &ldquo;But you are the best person for me, Cyrus Goodman.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, kissing the tip of TJ&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re the best person for me, TJ Kippen.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Hope that was okay lol</b></p><p><b>Send me prompts cuz im uninspired and I&rsquo;ll do them in a few days!</b></p>",
