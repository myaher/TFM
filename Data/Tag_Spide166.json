I really have no preference, and have gone by all of the above in various places on the internet. I'm a big Disney fan with heavy emphasis on the villains, particularly my all time favorite, Maleficent.\n\nOn this blog, I'll reblog a lot of Disney, Kingdom Hearts, and Marvel stuff. You'll also occasionally see my other fandoms, but the three prior mentioned ones tend to be where I spend most of my tumblr time. I try to avoid reblog bait as much as I can.\n\nBirthday: April 5th\nOccupation: Teacher\nMajor: English\nPolitical Views: USA Democratic Party\nSexuality: Gay\nPronouns: He/Him/His\nRelationship status: Single\nAnything else, just ask me :)",

Still this show had a LOT of villains, so this post is gonna be longer.</p><p><b>The Lizard</b> - Pretty good. As with SSM, I was never wowed or anything by him. I liked how he eventually kind of became a Hulk stand in during Secret Wars. Though he had a few unnecessary appearances, and that Lizard King episode was dreadful.</p><p><b>Kingpin</b> - AMAZING. He\u2019s such an iconic take on the character for good reason. This version of Kingpin alone is one of my twenty favorite villains of all time. He\u2019s just such a great threat, such an interesting character, and so incredibly well voiced. Like I could listen to Roscoe Lee Brown all day. Really a slam dunk for that show.</p><p><b>Alistair Smythe</b> - Just like Kingpin, he was amazing and an iconic villain for the show. They took a character who was\u2026 quite frankly awful in the comics and made him into one of the most multi-dimensional and entertaining villains the show ever did. Maxwell Caulfield did such a great job with him.</p><p><b>Doctor Octopus</b> - Still the best animated Doc Ock, in my opinion. Really smart take to make him Peter\u2019s former teacher to give him that strong personal connection to Peter. Also Elfrem  Zimbalist Jr. did SUCH a good job with his voice work. He had one or two episodes where he was just a stooge that kind of dragged him down, but for the most part he was great.</p><p><b>Mysterio</b> - Loved him. Greg Berger is still the voice I hear in my head when I read Mysterio in the comics. One of my favorite versions of Mysterio in general. Did NOT like his last episode though. Him sacrificing himself for the love of a woman didn\u2019t ring true to his character and it was so shoddily done. He still entertained me in that ep though.</p><p><b>Scorpion</b> - Not my favorite. Martin Landau was kind of awful as him, so I thought Richard Moll taking over was a breath of fresh air. He had a cool design though, and sometimes they made him actually sympathetic, which had some success.</p><p><b>Kraven the Hunter</b> - I liked the design and the voice actor, but everything else didn\u2019t work for me. He was kind of just a crazy rampaging dude on drugs, and we got that a lot on this show. I would have liked to have seen the sadistic hunter from the comics instead.</p><p><b>Rhino</b> - Hated the design. He looked like a guy in rhino pajamas. He had some legitimately funny moments though. I liked the way they played him for comedy, especially up against the Insidious Six.</p><p><b>Shocker</b> - A badass. This show made Shocker so fucking cool. Jim Cummings gives him a great sinister voice, and he always comes off as the type of guy who can and will kill you.\u00a0</p><p><b>Venom</b> - This show has my pick for the best version of the Alien Costume story, even better than the comics.

He\u2019s so deliciously slimy, always playing both sides against one another.</p><p><b>Chameleon</b> - A pretty interesting and different take on the character. I like that he\u2019s a terrorist assassin here. It create a fun Secret Agent type romp with him that you don\u2019t typically get from his usual \u201cimpersonate Spider-Man\u201d plot.

As MJ\u2019s abusive ex-boyfriend coming back to haunt her, he allowed MJ to get some really good development and I appreciated how creepy he was shown to be.\u00a0</p><p><b>Morbius</b> - UGH. AWFUL. Nothing about this guy worked. He was overused, poorly executed, and just a big stain on the entire show. Hated almost all of his episodes, but especially that awful Blade two-parter.</p><p><b>Vulture</b> - My favorite version of Vulture. I thought his youth absorption thing was clever and gave him kind of an interesting side with being an old man trying to reclaim his youth. He was really charismatic and fun to watch too. Also, that scene where he absorbs Spider-Man\u2019s youth - still one of the show\u2019s biggest\u00a0\u201cOH SHIT!\u201d moments.</p><p><b>Green Goblin</b> - Not a fan of their take on Osborn. However, the Goblin is legitimately excellent.\u00a0He\u2019s delightfully over the top and sinister. I like how he\u2019s sort of Norman\u2019s fairy godmother swooping in to save him from the people who hurt him. Also, Turning Point is, in my opinion, the best episode of the show and a version of the Night Gwen Stacy Died that\u2019s done <i>better</i> than the iconic comicbook (don\u2019t @ me; that issue is badly dated now). Also Neil Ross turned it out! His voice work was just on another level, and the scenes where he goes from Osborn to the Goblin are SICKENING! So good.</p><p><b>Herbert Landon</b> - Not as good as Smythe, still fun. David Warner is one of those voice actors I could listen to all the time. His initial X-Men appearance was eh to me, and they didn\u2019t carry his mutant bigotry over into his future episodes. But I liked him as Kingpin\u2019s lieutenant. He was fun there.</p><p><b>Tombstone</b> - Solid take on the character. Glad they kept his connection to Robertson at the forefront. Not a villain I was wowed by, but one who, like Hydro-Man, allowed for greatness to come from a supporting cast member.</p><p><b>Carnage</b> - Was not in a good episode, and he suffered from it. They had <i>some</i> good stuff.\u00a0His sheer evil glee about stealing life forces was just damn unsettling, and I liked that. But he was crammed into a cramped two-parter and never came back so it was a hot mess.</p><p><b>Harry Osborn</b> -\u00a0Harry wasn&rsquo;t great as the new Goblin, but I think that was kind of the point: to show how inexperienced and how not his father Harry is. Still, I never cared for him as a villain and his actor didn\u2019t help.</p><p><b>Electro</b> - Was not Electro. Though I do kind of like this character. He had the powers of a god and you felt it. He impressed me as a big climactic threat, but I still find myself confused about why they bothered making him Electro in the first place.</p><p><b>Spider-Carnage</b> - A great final boss for the show. I liked how everything came down to Peter having to fight himself, and how empathy won the day rather than fisticuffs. Chris Barnes did great with the evil tormented Spidey, and the whole\u00a0\u201cI want to destroy all of existence\u201d was a great\u00a0\u201cgo big or go home\u201d note to end on. The final confrontation on the rooftop with Uncle Ben and Spider-Carnage\u2019s suicide was just excellently done. Perfect final villain.</p>",

I thought his youth absorption thing was clever and gave him kind of an interesting side with being an old man trying to reclaim his youth. He was really charismatic and fun to watch too. Also, that scene where he absorbs Spider-Man\u2019s youth - still one of the show\u2019s biggest\u00a0\u201cOH SHIT!\u201d moments.</p><p><b>Green Goblin</b> - Not a fan of their take on Osborn. However, the Goblin is legitimately excellent.\u00a0He\u2019s delightfully over the top and sinister. I like how he\u2019s sort of Norman\u2019s fairy godmother swooping in to save him from the people who hurt him. Also, Turning Point is, in my opinion, the best episode of the show and a version of the Night Gwen Stacy Died that\u2019s done <i>better</i> than the iconic comicbook (don\u2019t @ me; that issue is badly dated now). Also Neil Ross turned it out! His voice work was just on another level, and the scenes where he goes from Osborn to the Goblin are SICKENING! So good.</p><p><b>Herbert Landon</b> - Not as good as Smythe, still fun. David Warner is one of those voice actors I could listen to all the time. His initial X-Men appearance was eh to me, and they didn\u2019t carry his mutant bigotry over into his future episodes. But I liked him as Kingpin\u2019s lieutenant. He was fun there.</p><p><b>Tombstone</b> - Solid take on the character. Glad they kept his connection to Robertson at the forefront. Not a villain I was wowed by, but one who, like Hydro-Man, allowed for greatness to come from a supporting cast member.</p><p><b>Carnage</b> - Was not in a good episode, and he suffered from it. They had <i>some</i> good stuff.\u00a0His sheer evil glee about stealing life forces was just damn unsettling, and I liked that. But he was crammed into a cramped two-parter and never came back so it was a hot mess.</p><p><b>Harry Osborn</b> -\u00a0Harry wasn\u2019t great as the new Goblin, but I think that was kind of the point: to show how inexperienced and how not his father Harry is. Still, I never cared for him as a villain and his actor didn\u2019t help.</p><p><b>Electro</b> - Was not Electro. Though I do kind of like this character. He had the powers of a god and you felt it. He impressed me as a big climactic threat, but I still find myself confused about why they bothered making him Electro in the first place.</p><p><b>Spider-Carnage</b> - A great final boss for the show. I liked how everything came down to Peter having to fight himself, and how empathy won the day rather than fisticuffs. Chris Barnes did great with the evil tormented Spidey, and the whole\u00a0\u201cI want to destroy all of existence\u201d was a great\u00a0\u201cgo big or go home\u201d note to end on. The final confrontation on the rooftop with Uncle Ben and Spider-Carnage\u2019s suicide was just excellently done. Perfect final villain.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Yeah, sure. Anon is referring to this <a href=\"http://gavillain.tumblr.com/post/181965862478/what-do-you-think-about-the-ssm-villains\">post</a>.</p><p>As with that one, I&rsquo;m only doing the major villains, and I&rsquo;m gonna be as concise as possible to fully express my opinions. Still this show had a LOT of villains, so this post is gonna be longer.</p><p><b>The Lizard</b> - Pretty good. As with SSM, I was never wowed or anything by him. I liked how he eventually kind of became a Hulk stand in during Secret Wars. Though he had a few unnecessary appearances, and that Lizard King episode was dreadful.</p><p><b>Kingpin</b> - AMAZING. He&rsquo;s such an iconic take on the character for good reason. This version of Kingpin alone is one of my twenty favorite villains of all time. He&rsquo;s just such a great threat, such an interesting character, and so incredibly well voiced. Like I could listen to Roscoe Lee Brown all day. Really a slam dunk for that show.</p><p><b>Alistair Smythe</b> - Just like Kingpin, he was amazing and an iconic villain for the show. They took a character who was&hellip; quite frankly awful in the comics and made him into one of the most multi-dimensional and entertaining villains the show ever did. Maxwell Caulfield did such a great job with him.</p><p><b>Doctor Octopus</b> - Still the best animated Doc Ock, in my opinion. Really smart take to make him Peter&rsquo;s former teacher to give him that strong personal connection to Peter. Also Elfrem  Zimbalist Jr. did SUCH a good job with his voice work. He had one or two episodes where he was just a stooge that kind of dragged him down, but for the most part he was great.</p><p><b>Mysterio</b> - Loved him. Greg Berger is still the voice I hear in my head when I read Mysterio in the comics. One of my favorite versions of Mysterio in general. Did NOT like his last episode though. Him sacrificing himself for the love of a woman didn&rsquo;t ring true to his character and it was so shoddily done. He still entertained me in that ep though.</p><p><b>Scorpion</b> - Not my favorite. Martin Landau was kind of awful as him, so I thought Richard Moll taking over was a breath of fresh air. He had a cool design though, and sometimes they made him actually sympathetic, which had some success.</p><p><b>Kraven the Hunter</b> - I liked the design and the voice actor, but everything else didn&rsquo;t work for me. He was kind of just a crazy rampaging dude on drugs, and we got that a lot on this show. I would have liked to have seen the sadistic hunter from the comics instead.</p><p><b>Rhino</b> - Hated the design. He looked like a guy in rhino pajamas. He had some legitimately funny moments though. I liked the way they played him for comedy, especially up against the Insidious Six.</p><p><b>Shocker</b> - A badass. This show made Shocker so fucking cool. Jim Cummings gives him a great sinister voice, and he always comes off as the type of guy who can and will kill you.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Venom</b> - This show has my pick for the best version of the Alien Costume story, even better than the comics. Brock is well established, and the symbiote is done very well. Venom&rsquo;s debut ep is one of the very best the show ever did. He felt like the most unforgiving and relentless foe in the show. His return in season three though? Not so good.</p><p><b>Hobgoblin</b> - Again, amazing.&nbsp;Mark Hamill gets a lot of credit for his work as the Joker, but you almost never hear him get praise for his work here even though I honestly think he&rsquo;s just as great as Hobgoblin. He&rsquo;s so deliciously slimy, always playing both sides against one another.</p><p><b>Chameleon</b> - A pretty interesting and different take on the character. I like that he&rsquo;s a terrorist assassin here. It create a fun Secret Agent type romp with him that you don&rsquo;t typically get from his usual &ldquo;impersonate Spider-Man&rdquo; plot. Him being the Red Skull&rsquo;s adopted son was an interesting twist too.</p><p><b>Silvermane</b> - Meh.</p><p><b>Hydro-Man</b> -&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not especially fond of Hydro-Man in and of himself, but I <i>do </i>appreciate the fact that he was in the show. As MJ&rsquo;s abusive ex-boyfriend coming back to haunt her, he allowed MJ to get some really good development and I appreciated how creepy he was shown to be.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Morbius</b> - UGH. AWFUL. Nothing about this guy worked. He was overused, poorly executed, and just a big stain on the entire show. Hated almost all of his episodes, but especially that awful Blade two-parter.</p><p><b>Vulture</b> - My favorite version of Vulture. I thought his youth absorption thing was clever and gave him kind of an interesting side with being an old man trying to reclaim his youth. He was really charismatic and fun to watch too. Also, that scene where he absorbs Spider-Man&rsquo;s youth - still one of the show&rsquo;s biggest&nbsp;&ldquo;OH SHIT!&rdquo; moments.</p><p><b>Green Goblin</b> - Not a fan of their take on Osborn. However, the Goblin is legitimately excellent.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s delightfully over the top and sinister. I like how he&rsquo;s sort of Norman&rsquo;s fairy godmother swooping in to save him from the people who hurt him. Also, Turning Point is, in my opinion, the best episode of the show and a version of the Night Gwen Stacy Died that&rsquo;s done <i>better</i> than the iconic comicbook (don&rsquo;t @ me; that issue is badly dated now).
