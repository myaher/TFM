Like what even is logic and common sense at this point in the stuff they put out&hellip;</p><p>I do think the original outline is still important in some respects and GRRM has always maintained that he is still heading towards the same ending he came up with in 1991. If the show had not done Jon/Dany, I would think that Jon/Arya is still possible. There has been foreshadowing for both Jon/Dany and Jon/Arya in the books. <br/></p><p>With respect to the books, GRRM continues to emphasize on the Jon-Arya relationship and in the last book, Jon ends up choosing love over duty and dying for her. The Jon-Ramsay feud over Arya in the books is eerily similar to the Jon -Tyrion feud over Arya in the original outline.

Willas had inquired after Sanaa\u2019s well-being and if he still hoped to wed Arya\u2019s sister he kept it to himself, more than happy to content himself to peppering Arya with questions about Direwolves and their habits. He seemed fascinated and she had noted the affection he lavished on his dogs and the pride he had in his hawks. She had decided that if he did want to marry Sansa it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing. Garlan had been equally friendly although less interested in subjects she cared about.</p><p>Now, Arya stood scowling in the vast banquet hall at Highgarden. It was too warm in the Reach for the furs and leathers she preferred to wear. Instead she was in a deep green dress that reached her midcalf and dark leggings. She was grateful for that much at least. The dress was relatively plain and it still allowed her freedom of movement albeit less than her own clothes from home would have. She knew that Sansa was right, as a Stark she was the best choice for an ambassador. The pride of the Tyrells would have been insulted had Sansa sent another. But that didn\u2019t mean she had to like it here. She looked down at her cup of wine and took another sip. She was still on her first cup while many of the men in the hall were well into their fourth or fifth. Arya preferred to keep her wits about her. Especially because the pretty girl seated next to her seemed to have made it her mission to make Arya blush as often as possible. Arya was unused to compliments and the sincerity wit which Lady Y/N gave them only made things worse. Arya wished she could blame the compliments on Lady Y/N being drunk but the girl next to Ed had not yet finished her own cup of wine. She seemed to be making a game out of only drinking when Arya did. When the banquet drew to a close and Arya rose from her seat she found Lady Y/N beside her. The other woman leaned in close and whispered meet me in the Rose gardens tomorrow at noon. And then in a sweep of her silken skirts she was gone.</p><p>Back in the chambers she had been given Arya lay awake trying to puzzle out what Lady Y/N had meant with her cryptic invitation. Had she just been invited into some political scheme or alliances. Or was this to be a more private meeting? Confused and annoyed Arya fell asleep trying to decide if she should even show up in the Rose garden tomorrow.</p><p>Arya stood facing the rose garden several minutes before noon. Her checks flamed red as she began to suspect the invitation was nothing more than an elaborate joke at her expense. She couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved when Lady Y/N finally showed up. Arya noticed the other girl looked quite different her hair held back in a simple braid instead of the ringlets she usually wore. And she wore a plain dress and apron both sprinkled with dirt as well as gardening gloves. Lady Y/N gave a satisfied grin as she studied Arya. \u201cGood you came.\u201d She declared adding \u201cfollow me. Arya followed her through the roses until she found herself in the center of what seemed to have been a circle made of rose hedges. Lady Y/N looked rather pleased with herself a satisfied smirk on her face. \u201cThis gardens mine\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d Arya replies confused. Had the other girl really asked her here to show her more roses.</p><p>Apparently not for Lady Y/N rolled her eyes. \u201cI thought you might want a quiet place to practice your swordplay away from prying eyes.  Well maybe not away from my eyes\u201d. She added boldly. </p><p>Arya looked at Lady Y/N \u201cSo your giving me the use of your garden? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it apparent to you? I like you that\u2019s why.\u201d </p><p>Arya gaped at Lady Y/N. \u201cLady Y/N why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll call me Y/N of course\u201d. The other girl declared with a winning smile. </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d. Arya told Y/N. </p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019d appreciate if you avoid killing my roses as much as possible\u201d. Lady Y/N continued in a tone that suggested she was talking about the weather and not giving Arya permission to do something she had sorely missed since her arrival in the Reach. </p><p>Looking at Lady Y/N\u2019s smirk Arya couldn\u2019t help but smile herself. \u201cHow can I thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy being happy here.\u201d Lady Y/N replied without hesitation. </p><p>\u201cDoes my happiness really matter that much to you?\u201d Arya asked trying to remember the last time someone other than her siblings or Brienne, or maybe Gendry had truly cared about her happiness.</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d Lady Y/N replied placing a hand on Arya\u2019s cheek.</p><p>And Arya leaned in and pressed her lips to</p><p>Y/N\u2019s</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get you to do this since you arrived here\u201d Lady Y/N confesses before leaning in once again to kiss Arya.</p><p>\u201cSo when you suggested a place away from prying eyes where I could practice my swordplay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy motives weren\u2019t entirely altruistic I admit.\u201d</p><p>Arya just smiled and went to kiss Y/N again</p>",

Willas had inquired after Sanaa\u2019s well-being and if he still hoped to wed Arya\u2019s sister he kept it to himself, more than happy to content himself to peppering Arya with questions about Direwolves and their habits. He seemed fascinated and she had noted the affection he lavished on his dogs and the pride he had in his hawks. She had decided that if he did want to marry Sansa it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing. Garlan had been equally friendly although less interested in subjects she cared about.</p><p>Now, Arya stood scowling in the vast banquet hall at Highgarden. It was too warm in the Reach for the furs and leathers she preferred to wear. Instead she was in a deep green dress that reached her midcalf and dark leggings. She was grateful for that much at least. The dress was relatively plain and it still allowed her freedom of movement albeit less than her own clothes from home would have. She knew that Sansa was right, as a Stark she was the best choice for an ambassador. The pride of the Tyrells would have been insulted had Sansa sent another. But that didn\u2019t mean she had to like it here. She looked down at her cup of wine and took another sip. She was still on her first cup while many of the men in the hall were well into their fourth or fifth. Arya preferred to keep her wits about her. Especially because the pretty girl seated next to her seemed to have made it her mission to make Arya blush as often as possible. Arya was unused to compliments and the sincerity wit which Lady Y/N gave them only made things worse. Arya wished she could blame the compliments on Lady Y/N being drunk but the girl next to Ed had not yet finished her own cup of wine. She seemed to be making a game out of only drinking when Arya did. When the banquet drew to a close and Arya rose from her seat she found Lady Y/N beside her. The other woman leaned in close and whispered meet me in the Rose gardens tomorrow at noon. And then in a sweep of her silken skirts she was gone.</p><p>Back in the chambers she had been given Arya lay awake trying to puzzle out what Lady Y/N had meant with her cryptic invitation. Had she just been invited into some political scheme or alliances. Or was this to be a more private meeting? Confused and annoyed Arya fell asleep trying to decide if she should even show up in the Rose garden tomorrow.</p><p>Arya stood facing the rose garden several minutes before noon. Her checks flamed red as she began to suspect the invitation was nothing more than an elaborate joke at her expense. She couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved when Lady Y/N finally showed up. Arya noticed the other girl looked quite different her hair held back in a simple braid instead of the ringlets she usually wore. And she wore a plain dress and apron both sprinkled with dirt as well as gardening gloves. Lady Y/N gave a satisfied grin as she studied Arya. \u201cGood you came.\u201d She declared adding \u201cfollow me. Arya followed her through the roses until she found herself in the center of what seemed to have been a circle made of rose hedges. Lady Y/N looked rather pleased with herself a satisfied smirk on her face. \u201cThis gardens mine\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d Arya replies confused. Had the other girl really asked her here to show her more roses.</p><p>Apparently not for Lady Y/N rolled her eyes. \u201cI thought you might want a quiet place to practice your swordplay away from prying eyes.
