He\u2019s not that good in making bouquets and things, but you know, he\u2019s charming and people enjoy talking with him while Yasha prepares their orders. </p><p>Everything goes alright until a blue tiefling starts coming in their shop with a messy ginger who wears a mildly stinky coat and a sad smile on his face. Jester, the blue tiefling, is way too talkative, she loves flowers though, so Yasha likes her, and the hobo guy is mostly silent, he looks around the shop curiously but he does nothing more than that and Molly is immediately drawn to him because hey he\u2019s <i>cute</i> and he has something in his sky blue eyes that makes his heart clench in his chest. Oddly, Molly doesn\u2019t know how to approach the guy, he looks out of place and he\u2019s sure he\u2019s there only because of his friend. </p><p>Some days later, the two come back to Yasha and Molly\u2019s shop after that first time and Molly still doesn\u2019t know what to say to Hobo Guy. Since when did he become so shy? Then, as Molly is playing with his tarot cards, Hobo Guys picks a vase of flowers and comes closer to the cashier. AND SPEAKS. And\u2026 oh. He has a sexy voice, too. <i>Fuck</i>. Molly is really fucked. Hobo Guy speaks to him and he can\u2019t think straight (rofl), but fortunately Yasha is there to rescue the Disaster Tiefling\u2122. Jester and Hobo Guy - whose name is Caleb, Molly will find out later that day from Yasha - pay and exit.</p><p>Jester and Hobo Guy continue to visit the shop once or twice a week for a while, Yasha is happy because she can talk with the tiefling about flowers and their proprieties, and Molly can spy his new crush from behind the counter. He looks like a lovesick, chin on his palm and elbow on the counter staring at Hobo Guy with heart eyes. He can\u2019t help it, and he thinks that Jester has noticed it but whatever. Every time Caleb buys a different vase of flowers.</p><p>One day, when the two are paying, Molly hands the bag to Hobo Guy, their eyes meet and he winks at him. Caleb blinks and blushes - BLUSHES - and Molly\u2019s smile even widens, while his heart beats like a hammer in his ribcage. He tells him to come back - as if he doesn\u2019t know already that he will - and Hobo Guy stammers something under his breath before being dragged by Jester out of the shop. Molly will think about that for days.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s been two months now, and Molly really wants to impress Caleb, so he asks Yasha to teach him about the language of flowers.\u00a0</p><p>Next time Hobo Guy comes to the shop he\u2019s not with Jester, but with a little green goblin and she starts strolling around the shop at Yasha\u2019s side because she wants to see all the flowers they have there. As usual, Caleb stands next to the counter as he follows his friend, Nott, with the gaze. Molly is waiting for the perfect time to give him what he has prepared for him, and he sweats, because even if he\u2019s always ready to make a fool of himself, he doesn\u2019t want to fuck up his only opportunity with the guy since he seems so shy.\u00a0</p><p>When Yasha and Nott have finished the tour, the goblin sees a beautiful bouquette behind the counter and asks if it\u2019s on sale.

The little smile he\u2019s had on his face svanishes in a second and Molly panics so much that he literally throws the bouquet in Caleb\u2019s arms who looks at him with wide eyes and Molly says\u00a0\u201cI hope you like it.\u201d trying to be nonchalant and failing miserably because he mumbles - blame his bi ass for that.

Jester, the blue tiefling, is way too talkative, she loves flowers though, so Yasha likes her, and the hobo guy is mostly silent, he looks around the shop curiously but he does nothing more than that and Molly is immediately drawn to him because hey he\u2019s <i>cute</i> and he has something in his sky blue eyes that makes his heart clench in his chest. Oddly, Molly doesn\u2019t know how to approach the guy, he looks out of place and he\u2019s sure he\u2019s there only because of his friend. </p><p>Some days later, the two come back to Yasha and Molly\u2019s shop after that first time and Molly still doesn\u2019t know what to say to Hobo Guy. Since when did he become so shy? Then, as Molly is playing with his tarot cards, Hobo Guys picks a vase of flowers and comes closer to the cashier. AND SPEAKS. And\u2026 oh. He has a sexy voice, too. <i>Fuck</i>. Molly is really fucked. Hobo Guy speaks to him and he can\u2019t think straight (rofl), but fortunately Yasha is there to rescue the Disaster Tiefling\u2122.

He looks like a lovesick, chin on his palm and elbow on the counter staring at Hobo Guy with heart eyes. He can\u2019t help it, and he thinks that Jester has noticed it but whatever. Every time Caleb buys a different vase of flowers.</p><p>One day, when the two are paying, Molly hands the bag to Hobo Guy, their eyes meet and he winks at him. Caleb blinks and blushes - BLUSHES - and Molly\u2019s smile even widens, while his heart beats like a hammer in his ribcage. He tells him to come back - as if he doesn\u2019t know already that he will - and Hobo Guy stammers something under his breath before being dragged by Jester out of the shop. Molly will think about that for days.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s been two months now, and Molly really wants to impress Caleb, so he asks Yasha to teach him about the language of flowers.\u00a0</p><p>Next time Hobo Guy comes to the shop he\u2019s not with Jester, but with a little green goblin and she starts strolling around the shop at Yasha\u2019s side because she wants to see all the flowers they have there. As usual, Caleb stands next to the counter as he follows his friend, Nott, with the gaze. Molly is waiting for the perfect time to give him what he has prepared for him, and he sweats, because even if he\u2019s always ready to make a fool of himself, he doesn\u2019t want to fuck up his only opportunity with the guy since he seems so shy.\u00a0</p><p>When Yasha and Nott have finished the tour, the goblin sees a beautiful bouquette behind the counter and asks if it\u2019s on sale.

The little smile he\u2019s had on his face svanishes in a second and Molly panics so much that he literally throws the bouquet in Caleb\u2019s arms who looks at him with wide eyes and Molly says\u00a0\u201cI hope you like it.\u201d trying to be nonchalant and failing miserably because he mumbles - blame his bi ass for that.
