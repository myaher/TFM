I'm Ludo, and this is my clusterfuck of a multi-fandom-blog :D I've started as a homestuck blog, so you'll still find some sediments of that here, but now I'm mainly lolling around in the Star Wars, Silmarillion/general Tolkien, Dragon Age and MCU Fandoms. The only thing I ever actively contribute to any of my fandoms is fanfic. Dirty, dirty fanfic. If anything I write has more than two chapters and is a WIP, it likely won't be finished. Except if there's something like 'Chapter 4/7', that means that I've not been as lazy as usual and even finished the fanfic before I posted it, wohoo! Generally there might be a bit of NSFW on my blog, but there are also a lot of sexy dudes, pretty ladies, lovely kitties and everything else I find interesting :) (also, I like feminist discourse and general social justice stuff, so there'll be some of that here too)</p>",

They really can&rsquo;t be used for aesthetic purposes in edits of some other character. In fact I am ashamed to say that I have been guilty of doing this before. I know now that it&rsquo;s really disrespectful to the character the quote was originally meant for. </p><h2>&ldquo;The wolf blood.\u201d Arya remembered now. \u201cI\u2019ll be as strong as Robb. I said I would.\u201d She took a deep breath, then lifted the broomstick in both hands and brought it down across her knee. It broke with a loud crack, and she threw the pieces aside.\u00a0<i>I am a direwolf, and done with wooden teeth</i>.</h2><p>&quot;I am a direwolf and done with wooden teeth&rdquo; this quote in itself propels forward Arya&rsquo;s storyline. It defines her for the lack of a better  word. Arya is tired of being afraid. She is tired of being a mouse, a weasel and a lamb. In fact the Old Gods themselves make the effort to remind Arya that she is in fact a &ldquo;direwolf&rdquo;. That she has the wolf blood running through  her veins. That for her sake she has to be strong. Arya has said previously that the Lannisters have taken everything from her and that includes her courage. Here by claiming that she IS in fact a direwolf and that she is done with wooden teeth, Arya is essentially reclaiming her courage. She in some ways is  reclaiming a part of her identity too and  we all know how much of a major role &ldquo;identity&rdquo; plays in Arya&rsquo;s storyline. </p><p>So it&rsquo;s really very weird to see that this quote is thrown around just like that and is being used in an edit of some other character for the &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;.

        "body": "<p><i>\u201cLet me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the <b>pack</b> survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm. Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa \u2026 Sansa is your sister. You may be as different as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as she needs you \u2026 and I need both of you, gods help me.</i>\u201d - Arya II, AGoT</p><p>\u201c<i>It&rsquo;s been a bad year for wolves,&ldquo; volunteered a sallow man in a travel-stained green cloak. &quot;Around the Gods Eye, the <b>packs</b> have grown bolder'n anyone can remember. Sheep, cows, dogs, makes no matter, they kill as they like, and they got no fear of men. It&rsquo;s worth your life to go into those woods by night.</i>\u201d - Arya\u00a0 II, ACoK</p><p>\u201c<i>I heard the same thing from my cousin, and she&rsquo;s not the sort to lie,&rdquo; an old woman said. &ldquo;She says there&rsquo;s this great <b>pack</b>, hundreds of them, mankillers. The one that leads them is a she-wolf, a bitch from the seventh hell</i>.\u201d - Arya II, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>The man in the green cloak said, &quot;I heard how this hellbitch walked into a village one day &hellip; a market day, people everywhere, and she walks in bold as you please and tears a baby from his mother&rsquo;s arms. When the tale reached Lord Mooton, him and his sons swore they&rsquo;d put an end to her. They tracked her to her lair with a <b>pack</b> of wolfhounds, and barely escaped with their skins. Not one of those dogs came back, not one.</i>\u201d - Arya II, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>She was making water, her clothing tangled about her ankles, when she heard rustling from under the trees. Hot Pie, she thought in panic, he followed me. Then she saw the eyes shining out from the wood, bright with reflected moonlight. Her belly clenched tight as she grabbed for Needle, not caring if she pissed herself, counting eyes, two four eight twelve, a whole <b>pack</b> &hellip;</i>\u201d - Arya III, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>It is wolves I mean to hunt. I can scarcely sleep at night for the howling.&rdquo; Bolton buckled on his belt, adjusting the hang of sword and dagger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s said that direwolves once roamed the north in great <b>packs</b> of a hundred or more, and feared neither man nor mammoth, but that was long ago and in another land. It is queer to see the common wolves of the south so bold.</i>\u201d - Arya X, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>For a long moment there was no sound but the wind and the water and the creak of leaf and limb. And then, far far off, beyond the godswood and the haunted towers and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal, from somewhere out in the world, came the long lonely howl of a wolf. Gooseprickles rose on Arya&rsquo;s skin, and for an instant she felt dizzy. Then, so faintly, it seemed as if she heard her father&rsquo;s voice. &quot;When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the <b>pack</b> survives,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But there is no <b>pack</b>,&rdquo; she whispered to the weirwood. Bran and Rickon were dead, the Lannisters had Sansa, Jon had gone to the Wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even me now, I&rsquo;m Nan</i>.\u201d - Arya X, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>That night she lay in her narrow bed upon the scratchy straw, listening to the voices of the living and the dead whisper and argue as she waited for the moon to rise. They were the only voices she trusted anymore. She could hear the sound of her own breath, and the wolves as well, a great <b>pack</b> of them now. They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood, she thought. They are calling to me</i>.\u201d - Arya X, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>From time to time she sent Hot Pie and Gendry on while she doubled back to try to confuse their trail, listening all the while for the first sign of pursuit. Too slow, she thought to herself, chewing her lip, we&rsquo;re going too slow, they&rsquo;ll catch us for certain. Once, from the crest of a ridge, she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them, and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton&rsquo;s riders were on them, but when she looked again she realized they were only a <b>pack</b> of wolves. She cupped her hands around her mouth and howled down at them, &quot;Ahooooooooo, ahooooooooo.&rdquo; When the largest of the wolves lifted its head and howled back, the sound made Arya shiver.</i>\u201d - Arya I, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>She would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, but she could not leave them. They were her <b>pack</b>, her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens. If the Mummers catch us, I&rsquo;ll tell them that I&rsquo;m Ned Stark&rsquo;s daughter and sister to the King in the North. I&rsquo;ll command them to take me to my brother, and to do no harm to Hot Pie and Gendry. They might not believe her, though, and even if they did &hellip; Lord Bolton was her brother&rsquo;s bannerman, but he frightened her all the same. I won&rsquo;t let them take us, she vowed silently, reaching back over her shoulder to touch the hilt of the sword that Gendry had stolen for her. I won&rsquo;t</i>.\u201d - Arya I, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>She was no little girl in the dream; she was a wolf, huge and powerful, and when she emerged from beneath the trees in front of them and bared her teeth in a low rumbling growl, she could smell the rank stench of fear from horse and man alike. The Lyseni&rsquo;s mount reared and screamed in terror, and the others shouted at one another in mantalk, but before they could act the other wolves came hurtling from the darkness and the rain, a great <b>pack</b> of them, gaunt and wet and silent</i>.\u201d - Arya I, ASoS\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>She missed him more than she thought she would, but Harwin made up for it some. She had told him about his father Hullen, and how she&rsquo;d found him dying by the stables in the Red Keep, the day she fled. &ldquo;He always said he&rsquo;d die in a stable,&rdquo; Harwin said, &ldquo;but we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would be his death, not a <b>pack</b> of lions.&rdquo; Arya told of Yoren and their escape from King&rsquo;s Landing as well, and much that had happened since, but she left out the stableboy she&rsquo;d stabbed with Needle, and the guard whose throat she&rsquo;d cut to get out of Harrenhal. Telling Harwin would be almost like telling her father, and there were some things that she could not bear having her father know.</i>\u201d - Arya III, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Lord Beric never shares his plans, but there&rsquo;s hunger down near Stoney Sept and the Threepenny Wood. I should look for him there.&ldquo; She took a sip of wine. &quot;You&rsquo;d best know, I&rsquo;ve had less pleasant callers as well. A <b>pack</b> of wolves came howling around my gates, thinking I might have Jaime Lannister in here</i>.\u201d - Arya IV, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>She looked at their filthy hair and scraggly beards and reddened eyes, at their dry, cracked, bleeding lips. Wolves, she thought again. Like me. Was this her <b>pack</b>? How could they be Robb&rsquo;s men? She wanted to hit them. She wanted to hurt them. She wanted to cry. They all seemed to be looking at her, the living and the dead alike. The old man had squeezed three fingers out between the bars. &quot;Water,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;water.</i>\u201d - Arya V, ASoS</p><p>\u201c<i>Sleep came as quick as she closed her eyes. She dreamed of wolves that night, stalking through a wet wood with the smell of rain and rot and blood thick in the air. Only they were good smells in the dream, and Arya knew she had nothing to fear. She was strong and swift and fierce, and her <b>pack</b> was all around her, her brothers and her sisters. They ran down a frightened horse together, tore its throat out, and feasted. And when the moon broke through the clouds, she threw back her head and howled</i>.\u201d - Arya V, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Arya sat up yawning. Gendry was stirring on her left and Lem Lemoncloak snoring loudly to her right, but the baying outside all but drowned him out. There must be half a hundred dogs out there. She crawled from under the blankets and hopped over Lem, Tom, and Jack-Be-Lucky to the window. When she opened the shutters wide, wind and wet and cold all came flooding in together. The day was grey and overcast. Down below, in the square, the dogs were barking, running in circles, growling and howling. There was a <b>pack</b> of them, great black mastiffs and lean wolfhounds and black-and-white sheepdogs and kinds Arya did not know, shaggy brindled beasts with long yellow teeth. Between the inn and the fountain, a dozen riders sat astride their horses, watching the townsmen open the fat man&rsquo;s cage and tug his arm until his swollen corpse spilled out onto the ground. The dogs were at him at once, tearing chunks of flesh off his bones.</i>\u201d - Arya V, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Outside the stables the rain was still falling, and distant lightning flashed in the west. Arya ran as fast as she could. She did not know where she was going, only that she wanted to be alone, away from all the voices, away from their hollow words and broken promises. All I wanted was to go to Riverrun. It was her own fault, for taking Gendry and Hot Pie with her when she left Harrenhal. She would have been better alone. If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught her, and she&rsquo;d be with Robb and her mother by now. They were never my <b>pack</b>. If they had been, they wouldn&rsquo;t leave me. She splashed through a puddle of muddy water. Someone was shouting her name, Harwin probably, or Gendry, but the thunder drowned them out as it rolled across the hills, half a heartbeat behind the lightning. The lightning lord, she thought angrily. Maybe he couldn&rsquo;t die, but he could lie.</i>\u201d - Arya VIII, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>And dreamed. That was the best part, the dreaming. She dreamed of wolves most every night. A great <b>pack</b> of wolves, with her at the head. She was bigger than any of them, stronger, swifter, faster. She could outrun horses and outfight lions. When she bared her teeth even men would run from her, her belly was never empty long, and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold. And her brothers and sisters were with her, many and more of them, fierce and terrible and hers. They would never leave her</i>.\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>But that was just stupid, like something Sansa might dream. Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon as they could, and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her, just like the Hound. None of them wanted her around. They were never my <b>pack</b>, not even Hot Pie and Gendry. I was stupid to think so, just a stupid little girl, and no wolf at all.</i>\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>The scent was stronger now. She pricked her ears up and listened to the grumbles of her <b>pack</b>, the shriek of angry crows, the whirr of wings and sound of running water. Somewhere far off she could hear horses and the calls of living men, but they were not what mattered. Only the scent mattered. She sniffed the air again. There it was, and now she saw it too, something pale and white drifting down the river, turning where it brushed against a snag. The reeds bowed down before it</i>.\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>But when the pale dawn light came filtering through the trees, it was him who woke her with the toe of his boot. She had dreamed she was a wolf again, chasing a riderless horse up a hill with a <b>pack</b> behind her, but his foot brought her back just as they were closing for the kill</i>.\u201d - Arya XIII, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>I have no home, Arya thought. I have no <b>pack</b>. And now I don&rsquo;t even have a horse.</i>\u201d - Arya XIII, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>They are not my Seven. They were my mother&rsquo;s gods, and they let the Freys murder her at the Twins. She wondered whether she would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its heart. Denyo might know, but she could not ask him. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told herself, with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she remembered her father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the <b>pack</b> survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the <b>pack</b> had been taken and slain and skinned.</i>\u201d - Arya I, AFfC<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>In the black of night she rose again, donned the clothes she&rsquo;d worn from Westeros, and buckled on her swordbelt. Needle hung from one hip, her dagger from the other. With her floppy hat on her head, her fingerless gloves tucked into her belt, and her silver fork in one hand, she went stealing up the steps. There is no place here for Arya of House Stark, she was thinking. Arya&rsquo;s place was Winterfell, only Winterfell was gone. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the <b>pack</b> survives. She had no <b>pack</b>, though. They had killed her <b>pack</b>, Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the queen, and when she tried to make a new one all of them ran off, Hot Pie and Gendry and Yoren and Lommy Greenhands, even Harwin, who had been her father&rsquo;s man. She shoved through the doors, out into the night.</i>\u201d - Arya II, AFfC<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Arya heard much and more that night, but almost all of it was in the tongue of Braavos, and she hardly understood one word in ten. Still as stone, she told herself. The hardest part was struggling not to yawn. Before the night was done, her wits were wandering. Standing there with the flagon in her hands, she dreamed she was a wolf, running free through a moonlit forest with a great <b>pack</b> howling at her heels.</i>\u201d - Arya II, AFfC<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>When they reached the broad straight waterway that was the Long Canal, they turned south for the fishmarket. Cat sat with her legs crossed, fighting a yawn and trying to recall the details of her dream. I dreamed I was a wolf again. She could remember the smells best of all: trees and earth, her <b>pack</b> brothers, the scents of horse and deer and man, each different from the others, and the sharp acrid tang of fear, always the same. Some nights the wolf dreams were so vivid that she could hear her brothers howling even as she woke, and once Brea had claimed that she was growling in her sleep as she thrashed beneath the covers. She thought that was some stupid lie till Talea said it too.</i>\u201d - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>The wolf dreams were the good ones. In the wolf dreams she was swift and strong, running down her prey with her <b>pack</b> at her heels. It was the other dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four.

Too slow, she thought to herself, chewing her lip, we\u2019re going too slow, they\u2019ll catch us for certain. Once, from the crest of a ridge, she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them, and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton\u2019s riders were on them, but when she looked again she realized they were only a <b>pack</b> of wolves. She cupped her hands around her mouth and howled down at them, \"Ahooooooooo, ahooooooooo.\u201d When the largest of the wolves lifted its head and howled back, the sound made Arya shiver.</i>\u201d - Arya I, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, but she could not leave them. They were her <b>pack</b>, her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens. If the Mummers catch us, I\u2019ll tell them that I\u2019m Ned Stark\u2019s daughter and sister to the King in the North. I\u2019ll command them to take me to my brother, and to do no harm to Hot Pie and Gendry. They might not believe her, though, and even if they did \u2026 Lord Bolton was her brother\u2019s bannerman, but he frightened her all the same. I won\u2019t let them take us, she vowed silently, reaching back over her shoulder to touch the hilt of the sword that Gendry had stolen for her. I won\u2019t</i>.\u201d - Arya I, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She was no little girl in the dream; she was a wolf, huge and powerful, and when she emerged from beneath the trees in front of them and bared her teeth in a low rumbling growl, she could smell the rank stench of fear from horse and man alike. The Lyseni\u2019s mount reared and screamed in terror, and the others shouted at one another in mantalk, but before they could act the other wolves came hurtling from the darkness and the rain, a great <b>pack</b> of them, gaunt and wet and silent</i>.\u201d - Arya I, ASoS\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She missed him more than she thought she would, but Harwin made up for it some. She had told him about his father Hullen, and how she\u2019d found him dying by the stables in the Red Keep, the day she fled. \u201cHe always said he\u2019d die in a stable,\u201d Harwin said, \u201cbut we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would be his death, not a <b>pack</b> of lions.\u201d Arya told of Yoren and their escape from King\u2019s Landing as well, and much that had happened since, but she left out the stableboy she\u2019d stabbed with Needle, and the guard whose throat she\u2019d cut to get out of Harrenhal. Telling Harwin would be almost like telling her father, and there were some things that she could not bear having her father know.</i>\u201d - Arya III, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Lord Beric never shares his plans, but there\u2019s hunger down near Stoney Sept and the Threepenny Wood. I should look for him there.\u201c She took a sip of wine. \"You\u2019d best know, I\u2019ve had less pleasant callers as well. A <b>pack</b> of wolves came howling around my gates, thinking I might have Jaime Lannister in here</i>.\u201d - Arya IV, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She looked at their filthy hair and scraggly beards and reddened eyes, at their dry, cracked, bleeding lips. Wolves, she thought again. Like me. Was this her <b>pack</b>? How could they be Robb\u2019s men? She wanted to hit them. She wanted to hurt them. She wanted to cry. They all seemed to be looking at her, the living and the dead alike. The old man had squeezed three fingers out between the bars. \"Water,\u201d he said, \u201cwater.</i>\u201d - Arya V, ASoS</p><p>\u201c<i>Sleep came as quick as she closed her eyes. She dreamed of wolves that night, stalking through a wet wood with the smell of rain and rot and blood thick in the air. Only they were good smells in the dream, and Arya knew she had nothing to fear. She was strong and swift and fierce, and her <b>pack</b> was all around her, her brothers and her sisters. They ran down a frightened horse together, tore its throat out, and feasted. And when the moon broke through the clouds, she threw back her head and howled</i>.\u201d - Arya V, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Arya sat up yawning. Gendry was stirring on her left and Lem Lemoncloak snoring loudly to her right, but the baying outside all but drowned him out. There must be half a hundred dogs out there. She crawled from under the blankets and hopped over Lem, Tom, and Jack-Be-Lucky to the window. When she opened the shutters wide, wind and wet and cold all came flooding in together. The day was grey and overcast. Down below, in the square, the dogs were barking, running in circles, growling and howling. There was a <b>pack</b> of them, great black mastiffs and lean wolfhounds and black-and-white sheepdogs and kinds Arya did not know, shaggy brindled beasts with long yellow teeth. Between the inn and the fountain, a dozen riders sat astride their horses, watching the townsmen open the fat man\u2019s cage and tug his arm until his swollen corpse spilled out onto the ground. The dogs were at him at once, tearing chunks of flesh off his bones.</i>\u201d - Arya V, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Outside the stables the rain was still falling, and distant lightning flashed in the west. Arya ran as fast as she could. She did not know where she was going, only that she wanted to be alone, away from all the voices, away from their hollow words and broken promises. All I wanted was to go to Riverrun. It was her own fault, for taking Gendry and Hot Pie with her when she left Harrenhal. She would have been better alone. If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught her, and she\u2019d be with Robb and her mother by now. They were never my <b>pack</b>. If they had been, they wouldn\u2019t leave me. She splashed through a puddle of muddy water. Someone was shouting her name, Harwin probably, or Gendry, but the thunder drowned them out as it rolled across the hills, half a heartbeat behind the lightning. The lightning lord, she thought angrily. Maybe he couldn\u2019t die, but he could lie.</i>\u201d - Arya VIII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>And dreamed. That was the best part, the dreaming. She dreamed of wolves most every night. A great <b>pack</b> of wolves, with her at the head. She was bigger than any of them, stronger, swifter, faster. She could outrun horses and outfight lions. When she bared her teeth even men would run from her, her belly was never empty long, and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold. And her brothers and sisters were with her, many and more of them, fierce and terrible and hers. They would never leave her</i>.\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>But that was just stupid, like something Sansa might dream. Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon as they could, and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her, just like the Hound. None of them wanted her around. They were never my <b>pack</b>, not even Hot Pie and Gendry. I was stupid to think so, just a stupid little girl, and no wolf at all.</i>\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>The scent was stronger now. She pricked her ears up and listened to the grumbles of her <b>pack</b>, the shriek of angry crows, the whirr of wings and sound of running water. Somewhere far off she could hear horses and the calls of living men, but they were not what mattered. Only the scent mattered. She sniffed the air again. There it was, and now she saw it too, something pale and white drifting down the river, turning where it brushed against a snag. The reeds bowed down before it</i>.\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>But when the pale dawn light came filtering through the trees, it was him who woke her with the toe of his boot. She had dreamed she was a wolf again, chasing a riderless horse up a hill with a <b>pack</b> behind her, but his foot brought her back just as they were closing for the kill</i>.\u201d - Arya XIII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>I have no home, Arya thought. I have no <b>pack</b>. And now I don\u2019t even have a horse.</i>\u201d - Arya XIII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>They are not my Seven. They were my mother\u2019s gods, and they let the Freys murder her at the Twins. She wondered whether she would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its heart. Denyo might know, but she could not ask him. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told herself, with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she remembered her father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the <b>pack</b> survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the <b>pack</b> had been taken and slain and skinned.</i>\u201d - Arya I, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>In the black of night she rose again, donned the clothes she\u2019d worn from Westeros, and buckled on her swordbelt. Needle hung from one hip, her dagger from the other. With her floppy hat on her head, her fingerless gloves tucked into her belt, and her silver fork in one hand, she went stealing up the steps. There is no place here for Arya of House Stark, she was thinking. Arya\u2019s place was Winterfell, only Winterfell was gone. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the <b>pack</b> survives. She had no <b>pack</b>, though. They had killed her <b>pack</b>, Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the queen, and when she tried to make a new one all of them ran off, Hot Pie and Gendry and Yoren and Lommy Greenhands, even Harwin, who had been her father\u2019s man. She shoved through the doors, out into the night.</i>\u201d - Arya II, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Arya heard much and more that night, but almost all of it was in the tongue of Braavos, and she hardly understood one word in ten. Still as stone, she told herself. The hardest part was struggling not to yawn. Before the night was done, her wits were wandering. Standing there with the flagon in her hands, she dreamed she was a wolf, running free through a moonlit forest with a great <b>pack</b> howling at her heels.</i>\u201d - Arya II, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>When they reached the broad straight waterway that was the Long Canal, they turned south for the fishmarket. Cat sat with her legs crossed, fighting a yawn and trying to recall the details of her dream. I dreamed I was a wolf again. She could remember the smells best of all: trees and earth, her <b>pack</b> brothers, the scents of horse and deer and man, each different from the others, and the sharp acrid tang of fear, always the same. Some nights the wolf dreams were so vivid that she could hear her brothers howling even as she woke, and once Brea had claimed that she was growling in her sleep as she thrashed beneath the covers. She thought that was some stupid lie till Talea said it too.</i>\u201d - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>The wolf dreams were the good ones. In the wolf dreams she was swift and strong, running down her prey with her <b>pack</b> at her heels. It was the other dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four. In that one she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but a monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save her. In that dream she was always weeping, like a frightened little girl. Cats never weep, she told herself, no more than wolves do. It\u2019s just a stupid dream</i>.\u201d - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>That night she dreamed she was a wolf again, but it was different from the other dreams. In this dream she had no <b>pack</b>. She prowled alone, bounding over rooftops and padding silently beside the banks of a canal, stalking shadows through the fog</i>.\u201d - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She opened her eyes and stared up blind at the black that shrouded her, her dream already fading.

Once, from the crest of a ridge, she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them, and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton\u2019s riders were on them, but when she looked again she realized they were only a <b>pack</b> of wolves. She cupped her hands around her mouth and howled down at them, \"Ahooooooooo, ahooooooooo.\u201d When the largest of the wolves lifted its head and howled back, the sound made Arya shiver.</i>\u201d - Arya I, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She would make much better time on her own, Arya knew, but she could not leave them. They were her <b>pack</b>, her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens. If the Mummers catch us, I\u2019ll tell them that I\u2019m Ned Stark\u2019s daughter and sister to the King in the North. I\u2019ll command them to take me to my brother, and to do no harm to Hot Pie and Gendry. They might not believe her, though, and even if they did \u2026 Lord Bolton was her brother\u2019s bannerman, but he frightened her all the same. I won\u2019t let them take us, she vowed silently, reaching back over her shoulder to touch the hilt of the sword that Gendry had stolen for her. I won\u2019t</i>.\u201d - Arya I, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She was no little girl in the dream; she was a wolf, huge and powerful, and when she emerged from beneath the trees in front of them and bared her teeth in a low rumbling growl, she could smell the rank stench of fear from horse and man alike. The Lyseni\u2019s mount reared and screamed in terror, and the others shouted at one another in mantalk, but before they could act the other wolves came hurtling from the darkness and the rain, a great <b>pack</b> of them, gaunt and wet and silent</i>.\u201d - Arya I, ASoS\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She missed him more than she thought she would, but Harwin made up for it some. She had told him about his father Hullen, and how she\u2019d found him dying by the stables in the Red Keep, the day she fled. \u201cHe always said he\u2019d die in a stable,\u201d Harwin said, \u201cbut we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would be his death, not a <b>pack</b> of lions.\u201d Arya told of Yoren and their escape from King\u2019s Landing as well, and much that had happened since, but she left out the stableboy she\u2019d stabbed with Needle, and the guard whose throat she\u2019d cut to get out of Harrenhal. Telling Harwin would be almost like telling her father, and there were some things that she could not bear having her father know.</i>\u201d - Arya III, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Lord Beric never shares his plans, but there\u2019s hunger down near Stoney Sept and the Threepenny Wood. I should look for him there.\u201c She took a sip of wine. \"You\u2019d best know, I\u2019ve had less pleasant callers as well. A <b>pack</b> of wolves came howling around my gates, thinking I might have Jaime Lannister in here</i>.\u201d - Arya IV, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She looked at their filthy hair and scraggly beards and reddened eyes, at their dry, cracked, bleeding lips. Wolves, she thought again. Like me. Was this her <b>pack</b>? How could they be Robb\u2019s men? She wanted to hit them. She wanted to hurt them. She wanted to cry. They all seemed to be looking at her, the living and the dead alike. The old man had squeezed three fingers out between the bars. \"Water,\u201d he said, \u201cwater.</i>\u201d - Arya V, ASoS</p><p>\u201c<i>Sleep came as quick as she closed her eyes. She dreamed of wolves that night, stalking through a wet wood with the smell of rain and rot and blood thick in the air. Only they were good smells in the dream, and Arya knew she had nothing to fear. She was strong and swift and fierce, and her <b>pack</b> was all around her, her brothers and her sisters. They ran down a frightened horse together, tore its throat out, and feasted. And when the moon broke through the clouds, she threw back her head and howled</i>.\u201d - Arya V, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Arya sat up yawning. Gendry was stirring on her left and Lem Lemoncloak snoring loudly to her right, but the baying outside all but drowned him out. There must be half a hundred dogs out there. She crawled from under the blankets and hopped over Lem, Tom, and Jack-Be-Lucky to the window. When she opened the shutters wide, wind and wet and cold all came flooding in together. The day was grey and overcast. Down below, in the square, the dogs were barking, running in circles, growling and howling. There was a <b>pack</b> of them, great black mastiffs and lean wolfhounds and black-and-white sheepdogs and kinds Arya did not know, shaggy brindled beasts with long yellow teeth. Between the inn and the fountain, a dozen riders sat astride their horses, watching the townsmen open the fat man\u2019s cage and tug his arm until his swollen corpse spilled out onto the ground. The dogs were at him at once, tearing chunks of flesh off his bones.</i>\u201d - Arya V, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Outside the stables the rain was still falling, and distant lightning flashed in the west. Arya ran as fast as she could. She did not know where she was going, only that she wanted to be alone, away from all the voices, away from their hollow words and broken promises. All I wanted was to go to Riverrun. It was her own fault, for taking Gendry and Hot Pie with her when she left Harrenhal. She would have been better alone. If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught her, and she\u2019d be with Robb and her mother by now. They were never my <b>pack</b>. If they had been, they wouldn\u2019t leave me. She splashed through a puddle of muddy water. Someone was shouting her name, Harwin probably, or Gendry, but the thunder drowned them out as it rolled across the hills, half a heartbeat behind the lightning. The lightning lord, she thought angrily. Maybe he couldn\u2019t die, but he could lie.</i>\u201d - Arya VIII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>And dreamed. That was the best part, the dreaming. She dreamed of wolves most every night. A great <b>pack</b> of wolves, with her at the head. She was bigger than any of them, stronger, swifter, faster. She could outrun horses and outfight lions. When she bared her teeth even men would run from her, her belly was never empty long, and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold. And her brothers and sisters were with her, many and more of them, fierce and terrible and hers. They would never leave her</i>.\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>But that was just stupid, like something Sansa might dream. Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon as they could, and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her, just like the Hound. None of them wanted her around. They were never my <b>pack</b>, not even Hot Pie and Gendry. I was stupid to think so, just a stupid little girl, and no wolf at all.</i>\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>The scent was stronger now. She pricked her ears up and listened to the grumbles of her <b>pack</b>, the shriek of angry crows, the whirr of wings and sound of running water. Somewhere far off she could hear horses and the calls of living men, but they were not what mattered. Only the scent mattered. She sniffed the air again. There it was, and now she saw it too, something pale and white drifting down the river, turning where it brushed against a snag. The reeds bowed down before it</i>.\u201d - Arya XII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>But when the pale dawn light came filtering through the trees, it was him who woke her with the toe of his boot. She had dreamed she was a wolf again, chasing a riderless horse up a hill with a <b>pack</b> behind her, but his foot brought her back just as they were closing for the kill</i>.\u201d - Arya XIII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>I have no home, Arya thought. I have no <b>pack</b>. And now I don\u2019t even have a horse.</i>\u201d - Arya XIII, ASoS<br></p><p>\u201c<i>They are not my Seven. They were my mother\u2019s gods, and they let the Freys murder her at the Twins. She wondered whether she would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its heart. Denyo might know, but she could not ask him. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told herself, with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she remembered her father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the <b>pack</b> survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the <b>pack</b> had been taken and slain and skinned.</i>\u201d - Arya I, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>In the black of night she rose again, donned the clothes she\u2019d worn from Westeros, and buckled on her swordbelt. Needle hung from one hip, her dagger from the other. With her floppy hat on her head, her fingerless gloves tucked into her belt, and her silver fork in one hand, she went stealing up the steps. There is no place here for Arya of House Stark, she was thinking. Arya\u2019s place was Winterfell, only Winterfell was gone. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the <b>pack</b> survives. She had no <b>pack</b>, though. They had killed her <b>pack</b>, Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the queen, and when she tried to make a new one all of them ran off, Hot Pie and Gendry and Yoren and Lommy Greenhands, even Harwin, who had been her father\u2019s man. She shoved through the doors, out into the night.</i>\u201d - Arya II, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Arya heard much and more that night, but almost all of it was in the tongue of Braavos, and she hardly understood one word in ten. Still as stone, she told herself. The hardest part was struggling not to yawn. Before the night was done, her wits were wandering. Standing there with the flagon in her hands, she dreamed she was a wolf, running free through a moonlit forest with a great <b>pack</b> howling at her heels.</i>\u201d - Arya II, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>When they reached the broad straight waterway that was the Long Canal, they turned south for the fishmarket. Cat sat with her legs crossed, fighting a yawn and trying to recall the details of her dream. I dreamed I was a wolf again. She could remember the smells best of all: trees and earth, her <b>pack</b> brothers, the scents of horse and deer and man, each different from the others, and the sharp acrid tang of fear, always the same. Some nights the wolf dreams were so vivid that she could hear her brothers howling even as she woke, and once Brea had claimed that she was growling in her sleep as she thrashed beneath the covers. She thought that was some stupid lie till Talea said it too.</i>\u201d - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>The wolf dreams were the good ones. In the wolf dreams she was swift and strong, running down her prey with her <b>pack</b> at her heels. It was the other dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four. In that one she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her mother screaming, but a monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save her. In that dream she was always weeping, like a frightened little girl. Cats never weep, she told herself, no more than wolves do. It\u2019s just a stupid dream</i>.\u201d - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>That night she dreamed she was a wolf again, but it was different from the other dreams. In this dream she had no <b>pack</b>. She prowled alone, bounding over rooftops and padding silently beside the banks of a canal, stalking shadows through the fog</i>.\u201d - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br></p><p>\u201c<i>She opened her eyes and stared up blind at the black that shrouded her, her dream already fading. So beautiful. She licked her lips, remembering. The bleating of the sheep, the terror in the shepherd\u2019s eyes, the sound the dogs had made as she killed them one by one, the snarling of her <b>pack</b>. Game had become scarcer since the snows began to fall, but last night they had feasted. Lamb and dog and mutton and the flesh of man. Some of her little grey cousins were afraid of men, even dead men, but not her. Meat was meat, and men were prey. She was the night wolf. But only when she dreamed.</i>\u201d - The Blind Girl, ADwD<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Not for me. Her nights were bathed in moonlight and filled with the songs of her <b>pack</b>, with the taste of red meat torn off the bone, with the warm familiar smells of her grey cousins. Only during the days was she alone and blind</i>.\u201d - The Blind Girl, ADwD\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils\u2026or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great <b>pack</b> at her heels, hard on the scent of prey</i>.\u201d - Mercy, TWoW<br></p>",
                "content": "<p><i>&ldquo;Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the <b>pack</b> survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm. Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa &hellip; Sansa is your sister. You may be as different as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as she needs you &hellip; and I need both of you, gods help me.</i>&rdquo; - Arya II, AGoT</p><p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s been a bad year for wolves,&ldquo; volunteered a sallow man in a travel-stained green cloak. \"Around the Gods Eye, the <b>packs</b> have grown bolder'n anyone can remember.

It&rsquo;s worth your life to go into those woods by night.</i>&rdquo; - Arya&nbsp; II, ACoK</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I heard the same thing from my cousin, and she&rsquo;s not the sort to lie,&rdquo; an old woman said. &ldquo;She says there&rsquo;s this great <b>pack</b>, hundreds of them, mankillers.

I can scarcely sleep at night for the howling.&rdquo; Bolton buckled on his belt, adjusting the hang of sword and dagger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s said that direwolves once roamed the north in great <b>packs</b> of a hundred or more, and feared neither man nor mammoth, but that was long ago and in another land. It is queer to see the common wolves of the south so bold.</i>&rdquo; - Arya X, ACoK<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>For a long moment there was no sound but the wind and the water and the creak of leaf and limb. And then, far far off, beyond the godswood and the haunted towers and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal, from somewhere out in the world, came the long lonely howl of a wolf. Gooseprickles rose on Arya&rsquo;s skin, and for an instant she felt dizzy. Then, so faintly, it seemed as if she heard her father&rsquo;s voice. \"When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the <b>pack</b> survives,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But there is no <b>pack</b>,&rdquo; she whispered to the weirwood.

She prowled alone, bounding over rooftops and padding silently beside the banks of a canal, stalking shadows through the fog</i>.&rdquo; - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>She opened her eyes and stared up blind at the black that shrouded her, her dream already fading. So beautiful. She licked her lips, remembering. The bleating of the sheep, the terror in the shepherd&rsquo;s eyes, the sound the dogs had made as she killed them one by one, the snarling of her <b>pack</b>. Game had become scarcer since the snows began to fall, but last night they had feasted. Lamb and dog and mutton and the flesh of man. Some of her little grey cousins were afraid of men, even dead men, but not her. Meat was meat, and men were prey. She was the night wolf. But only when she dreamed.</i>&rdquo; - The Blind Girl, ADwD<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Not for me. Her nights were bathed in moonlight and filled with the songs of her <b>pack</b>, with the taste of red meat torn off the bone, with the warm familiar smells of her grey cousins. Only during the days was she alone and blind</i>.&rdquo; - The Blind Girl, ADwD&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils&hellip;or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great <b>pack</b> at her heels, hard on the scent of prey</i>.&rdquo; - Mercy, TWoW<br /></p>",
