        "body": "<h2>A Marriage of Convenience {Chapter Ten}</h2><p>The rhythmic banging from down the hall woke Nott up the next morning. She frowned and sat up, looking around the room. Caleb was getting dressed at the end of the bed and he winced after a particularly loud bang.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Nott asked, drowsily.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard\u2019s mother locked her in her room after yesterday. \u2018For her own protection\u2019 or so she says.\u201d</p><p>Nott grunted in annoyance and pulled the blanket up over her head. \u201cBeau\u2019s parents suck.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Caleb sighed and finished tying his shoe. \u201cYes, they certainly do. I\u2019m going down to fetch some breakfast, is there anything you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBacon. Bring some for Beau, I\u2019ll take it to her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb seemed surprised by that but nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said as he left the room. He walked down the stairs and easily found the kitchen. Breakfast had come and gone but there were plenty of left overs strewn across the counters.</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen their faces when they walked in and realized they didn&rsquo;t have to fight.\u201d</p><p>Calab frowned and looked around , catching sight of Beau propped up on the counter with her feet folded under her as Caduceus was sorting food into bags. \u201cBeau?\u201d he asked. He paused and listened closely but there was definitely still thumping coming from the direction he\u2019d come. \u201cI thought-\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and waved dismissively. \u201cAre you kidding? I learned how to pick that lock when I was nine years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid some of the servant\u2019s kids to make as much noise as they wanted. Right now I think they&rsquo;re taking turns throwing my old dolls at the door as hard as they can. Door\u2019s not even locked any more, they can leave whenever they want.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and picked up a plate of hash browns. \u201cMr. Clay. Good morning.\u201d</p><p>The fibolg gave him a sweet smile. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Caleb. I\u2019m just packing up leftovers to be taken to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTown?\u201d</p><p>Beau nodded and hopped off the counter. \u201cYeah, we always have so much left over. The servants take what they want and whatever is left gets donated in town. Jester is going to take my letter and notes to the Gentleman later today and she\u2019s gonna run these down for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it that this is not your mother\u2019s idea?\u201d</p><p>Beau snorted. \u201cOf course not. My mother thinks charity is the worst thing you can do for another person. If you help them how will they ever learn to take care of themselves?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt was Caduceus\u2019 idea.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped up to Beau and gently touched her elbow. \u201cI\u2019m glad I ran into you. I actually wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>Beau raised an eyebrow and looked back at Caduceus who wasn\u2019t paying them any attention. She put her hand on his shoulder and pushed him out of the kitchen and into the pantry. It could hardly be called a pantry, this room was bigger than his guest room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you said yesterday sort of\u2026 resonated with me. Made me think about some things. Right now you and I are sort of\u2026 working against one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working with the Gentleman to further both of your goals without being detriment to either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get to the point already!\u201d</p><p>Caleb took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cI want to tell you everything. The reason I agreed to come here, the things I\u2019m looking for. I want to tell you so that you can help me and I will, in turn, help you in anyway that I can to make sure that this scheme with the Gentleman goes off without a hitch.</p><p>She gave him an unsure look up and down. \u201cReally? You\u2019re not fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNein. I will tell you the truth, everything you need to know to understand what I\u2019m doing here and why.\u201d</p><p>Beau didn\u2019t answer right away, which we was surprised about. She was surprising him a lot lately but he hadn\u2019t considered her a think-before-you-act kind of person. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that we should continue this engagement facade for a few weeks longer.\u201d</p><p>Beau grimaced. \u201cMy mom is already planning the wedding. If we drag this out any longer she\u2019ll start putting in deposits and shit, you can\u2019t get those back. She\u2019ll be pissed at me. She might actually kill me. Well\u2026\u201d she paused thoughtfully like she was actually considering the method with which her mother would kill her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to get her hands dirty. She\u2019d make someone else do it, but I would definitely die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a week then. This time next week I will be out of your hair forever and you can go back to terrorizing suitors until your winery deal gets on its feet.\u201d</p><p>Beau bit the inside of her cheek and started tapping her foot nervously. \u201cOkay, okay, okay,\u201d she mumbled, looking away from him and rubbing her hands together. She seemed to come to a conclusion and nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d She reached out to shake his hand.</p><p>He took it and they shook on it. \u201cGreat. Meet me in the library after dinner. Come alone.\u201d</p><p>She sneered. \u201cCould you have said that more ominously?\u201d But she turned and left anyway. \u201cSee you in the library.\u201d</p><p>Jester was talking happily with Caduceus when she stepped out of the pantry. She grinned at Beau when she caught her eye. \u201cThere you are! I was just about to head out but I wanted to see you before I left, I won\u2019t be back until late. I\u2019m gonna visit Momma while I\u2019m in town, do you want me say anything to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give her a kiss for me, like usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, Snuggly-poo.\u201d She giggled at her rhyme. \u201cI have the notebook you gave me and the letter for the Gentleman. Now I have the food for the Food Kitchen. I think that\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nodded and handed her the boxes of food. \u201cSounds like everything.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped out into the kitchen after Beau and frowned as Jester was loaded down with food. \u201cWill you be able to carry that the whole way?\u201d</p><p>Jester grinned at him and shifted the boxes into one arm so that she could flex the other. \u201cI\u2019m super strong! Beau and I work out together a lot because there\u2019s, like, nothing else to do around here when there aren\u2019t suitors to chase away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long trip though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are staff carriages for stuff like this. It\u2019s not as big or luxurious as the one we took yesterday but it\u2019ll do the job,\u201d Beau said, walking over to take a few boxes from her best friend. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get these to the carriage at least. Caleb, don\u2019t forget our deal.\u201d Then they both turned to leave.</p><p>Caleb frowned. \u201cI won\u2019t forget it, it was my idea.\u201d</p><p>She just flipped him off while balancing the boxes on her arm and then they were gone out the back door.</p><p>Jester hummed happily to herself as the carriage pulled up to a stop in front of the Food Kitchen. A young woman with long red hair that draped elegantly over her shoulders came out the front door with a smile as Jester climbed down.</p><p>\u201cLionett delivery?\u201d she asked, her shy voice quiet in the morning hustle and bustle around them.</p><p>\u201cSure is! Courtesy of Beau Lionett.\u201d</p><p>The young woman nodded and started taking a few boxes from Jester. \u201cWas she alright? I heard there was some trouble at the circus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s just fine, it was all a big misunderstanding. Beau\u2019s not gonna let nothing like that get her down!\u201d With her arms full of food she followed the young woman around the back of the shop and into the kitchen which was already a flurry of activity. They sat the boxes down on what little empty counter space they could find and the the young woman walked with Jester back outside.</p><p>\u201cPlease let Miss Lionett know how much we appreciate her kind donation. I wish so much that she could come down and see all the good she\u2019s done around here.\u201d Jester noticed that the redhead was blushing slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about her, is she as kind as they say?\u201d</p><p>Jester wasn\u2019t sure what the people in town knew about her best friend, but when she thought about it she could understand why they had romanticized her slightly. All they knew about her was that she was trapped in her home against her will and donated her things to poor people. They didn\u2019t know that she cursed worse than a sailor and was always one wrong word away from punching most people. Maybe they didn\u2019t need to know those parts. \u201cShe\u2019s so kind, you have no idea. She\u2019s my very best friend and I love her to bits.\u201d</p><p>Jester waved goodbye and climbed back into the carriage, asking the driver to take her to the Gentleman\u2019s tavern. She stepped inside to find it mostly empty at this early hour. The only person inside was the tender at the bar cleaning mugs with a rag. She cleared her throat and stepped inside. \u201cI have a lot of presents,\u201d she said in a hushed whisper. The man gave her an unimpressed look and she suddenly panicked. Had she said it wrong? \u201cI have things to offer? I have\u2026 I brought\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man sighed and waved his hand. \u201cYou come bearing many gifts, yeah, yeah, I get it. Go on in.\u201d</p><p>Jester nodded and hurried down the stairs. It had been just over twelves hours she\u2019d been here last the the scene was remarkably changed. There were people laying over tables, fast asleep and snoring loudly. The floor was sticky with spilled ale and she had to step over a passed out patron laying the middle of the floor. The tall goliath woman from the night before was standing resolute beside the empty throne on the platform. Seeing as she was the only person conscious at the moment, Jester made her way over and cleared her throat. \u201cAh, excuse me? I\u2019m looking for the Gentleman? I have Beau\u2019s notes that she promised him?\u201d The goliath didn\u2019t answer and Jester frowned. \u201cWhy won\u2019t anyone talk to me? Lionett! With the winery stuff. I have the notes he asked for.\u201d</p><p>A door across the room opened with a bang and a groggy genasi man stood in the doorway, his robe hanging open but thankfully with nothing on display below the belt. \u201cWhat is all the ruckus?\u201d</p><p>There was a blonde elf hanging off his hand arm who yawned and rubbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll go get us some coffee, love,\u201d she said, walking around him as he started towards Jester.</p><p>Jester held up the notebook and letter. \u201cFrom Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he grinned, his mood turning. \u201cThat was quick. It\u2019s nice to know that young Beauregard can be trusted to be prompt at the very least. What was your name again, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester.\u201d</p><p>He nodded absently as he flipped through Beau\u2019s notes. \u201cJester. Jester what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavore.\u201d</p><p>He paused. Well, more like froze. His eyes were wide when he looked at her. \u201cLavore? Any relation to Marion Lavore?\u201d</p><p>Jester was put off by the sudden mention of her mother but nodded. \u201cYes. The Ruby of the Sea, she\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><p>The Gentleman looked her over with a frown. \u201cHow old are you, Jester Lavore?\u201d</p><p>Jester sneered. She really didn\u2019t like him. \u201cThat\u2019s a rude thing to ask.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but it wasn\u2019t a joyful laugh. It was sad and nearly made her feel sorry for him. \u201cYes, you were certainly raised by dear Marion, alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew her?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be jolted out of whatever reverie he was in and shook his head. \u201cNo, no, of course not. I\u2019ve heard of her. Thank you for the delivery, you may go now.\u201d</p><p>Jester was still frowning but she left the way that she came and when she climbed back into the carriage she told the driver to take her to one last stop. \u201cThe city jail, please,\u201d she called. As the horse pulled her towards her final destination, she couldn\u2019t get the conversation with the Gentleman out of her mind. She barely noticed when she arrived at the jail and walked inside on auto pilot. She\u2019d been here a million times, the old man at the counter just waved her through. Jester hummed and skipped as she made her way down the line of cells to the one she knew held her mother. She peeked inside and grinned. \u201cMomma!\u201d</p><p>Marion looked up and smiled softly, sitting aside her knitting and moving to her feet. \u201cJester! My little sapphire, it\u2019s been so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It has been a few weeks. It\u2019s been so busy up at the house.\u201d She slipped her arms through the bars and her mother stepped into them, reaching through the bars to hold each other as close as the metal would allow. She squeezed her face against the bars until her mother moved in to meet her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s from me.\u201d She puckered up again and Marion chuckled but leaned in for another kiss. \u201cThat one is from Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear, give Beauregard my love. I\u2019m just glad I got to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau was in town yesterday. Her mother let her go to the carnival.\u201d </p><p>Marion gasped as she pulled away. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry she couldn\u2019t come see me. I heard there was some trouble at the carnival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, Beau got kidnapped! By this blue sweaty guy. We had to break in and get her it was super cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, that sounds like a grand adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she ended up saving herself, so it wasn\u2019t as fun as it would have been if we\u2019d killed everyone in a blaze of glory.\u201d</p><p>Marion chuckled and reached up to run her hand down her daughter\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m glad you had fun dear. Is she doing better now? I\u2019m so worried about her, stuck in that house with those people.\u201d</p><p>Jester sighed and leaned her forehead against the bar in front of her. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 I won\u2019t say she\u2019s better exactly, technically. She shaved the bottom of her hair, or, technically, I shaved the bottom of her hair but it was her idea. She\u2019s more comfortable than I\u2019ve ever seen her now. She made a new friend too.\u201d</p><p>Marion looked surprised. \u201cReally? Beau?\u201d</p><p>Jester giggled. \u201cYeah, yeah, his name is Caleb and they played a fun game the other day. She likes him even though she pretends she doesn\u2019t. He has a goblin for a mom. But she\u2019s super sweet, she\u2019s not like other goblins.\u201d</p><p>Marion didn\u2019t seem to understand but she smiled and kissed her daughter\u2019s forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice, dear. Have you made any new friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 you know about Fjord. I really like Caleb and Nott too, they\u2019re super great. Ooh, and at the carnival I met some people named Yasha and Mollymauk.\u201d</p><p>A voice called out from farther down the line of cells. \u201cWas that my name I heard?\u201d</p><p>Jester blinked in surprise and pulled away from her mother. \u201cMolly?\u201d</p>",

I\u2019m going down to fetch some breakfast, is there anything you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBacon. Bring some for Beau, I\u2019ll take it to her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb seemed surprised by that but nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said as he left the room. He walked down the stairs and easily found the kitchen. Breakfast had come and gone but there were plenty of left overs strewn across the counters.</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen their faces when they walked in and realized they didn\u2019t have to fight.\u201d</p><p>Calab frowned and looked around , catching sight of Beau propped up on the counter with her feet folded under her as Caduceus was sorting food into bags. \u201cBeau?\u201d he asked. He paused and listened closely but there was definitely still thumping coming from the direction he\u2019d come. \u201cI thought-\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and waved dismissively. \u201cAre you kidding? I learned how to pick that lock when I was nine years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid some of the servant\u2019s kids to make as much noise as they wanted. Right now I think they\u2019re taking turns throwing my old dolls at the door as hard as they can. Door\u2019s not even locked any more, they can leave whenever they want.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and picked up a plate of hash browns. \u201cMr. Clay. Good morning.\u201d</p><p>The fibolg gave him a sweet smile. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Caleb. I\u2019m just packing up leftovers to be taken to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTown?\u201d</p><p>Beau nodded and hopped off the counter. \u201cYeah, we always have so much left over. The servants take what they want and whatever is left gets donated in town. Jester is going to take my letter and notes to the Gentleman later today and she\u2019s gonna run these down for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it that this is not your mother\u2019s idea?\u201d</p><p>Beau snorted. \u201cOf course not. My mother thinks charity is the worst thing you can do for another person. If you help them how will they ever learn to take care of themselves?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt was Caduceus\u2019 idea.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped up to Beau and gently touched her elbow. \u201cI\u2019m glad I ran into you. I actually wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>Beau raised an eyebrow and looked back at Caduceus who wasn\u2019t paying them any attention. She put her hand on his shoulder and pushed him out of the kitchen and into the pantry. It could hardly be called a pantry, this room was bigger than his guest room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you said yesterday sort of\u2026 resonated with me. Made me think about some things. Right now you and I are sort of\u2026 working against one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working with the Gentleman to further both of your goals without being detriment to either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get to the point already!\u201d</p><p>Caleb took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cI want to tell you everything. The reason I agreed to come here, the things I\u2019m looking for. I want to tell you so that you can help me and I will, in turn, help you in anyway that I can to make sure that this scheme with the Gentleman goes off without a hitch.</p><p>She gave him an unsure look up and down. \u201cReally? You\u2019re not fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNein. I will tell you the truth, everything you need to know to understand what I\u2019m doing here and why.\u201d</p><p>Beau didn\u2019t answer right away, which we was surprised about. She was surprising him a lot lately but he hadn\u2019t considered her a think-before-you-act kind of person. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that we should continue this engagement facade for a few weeks longer.\u201d</p><p>Beau grimaced. \u201cMy mom is already planning the wedding. If we drag this out any longer she\u2019ll start putting in deposits and shit, you can\u2019t get those back. She\u2019ll be pissed at me. She might actually kill me. Well\u2026\u201d she paused thoughtfully like she was actually considering the method with which her mother would kill her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to get her hands dirty. She\u2019d make someone else do it, but I would definitely die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a week then. This time next week I will be out of your hair forever and you can go back to terrorizing suitors until your winery deal gets on its feet.\u201d</p><p>Beau bit the inside of her cheek and started tapping her foot nervously. \u201cOkay, okay, okay,\u201d she mumbled, looking away from him and rubbing her hands together. She seemed to come to a conclusion and nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d She reached out to shake his hand.</p><p>He took it and they shook on it. \u201cGreat. Meet me in the library after dinner. Come alone.\u201d</p><p>She sneered. \u201cCould you have said that more ominously?\u201d But she turned and left anyway. \u201cSee you in the library.\u201d</p><p>Jester was talking happily with Caduceus when she stepped out of the pantry. She grinned at Beau when she caught her eye. \u201cThere you are! I was just about to head out but I wanted to see you before I left, I won\u2019t be back until late. I\u2019m gonna visit Momma while I\u2019m in town, do you want me say anything to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give her a kiss for me, like usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, Snuggly-poo.\u201d She giggled at her rhyme. \u201cI have the notebook you gave me and the letter for the Gentleman. Now I have the food for the Food Kitchen. I think that\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nodded and handed her the boxes of food. \u201cSounds like everything.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped out into the kitchen after Beau and frowned as Jester was loaded down with food. \u201cWill you be able to carry that the whole way?\u201d</p><p>Jester grinned at him and shifted the boxes into one arm so that she could flex the other. \u201cI\u2019m super strong! Beau and I work out together a lot because there\u2019s, like, nothing else to do around here when there aren\u2019t suitors to chase away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long trip though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are staff carriages for stuff like this. It\u2019s not as big or luxurious as the one we took yesterday but it\u2019ll do the job,\u201d Beau said, walking over to take a few boxes from her best friend. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get these to the carriage at least. Caleb, don\u2019t forget our deal.\u201d Then they both turned to leave.</p><p>Caleb frowned. \u201cI won\u2019t forget it, it was my idea.\u201d</p><p>She just flipped him off while balancing the boxes on her arm and then they were gone out the back door.</p><p>Jester hummed happily to herself as the carriage pulled up to a stop in front of the Food Kitchen. A young woman with long red hair that draped elegantly over her shoulders came out the front door with a smile as Jester climbed down.</p><p>\u201cLionett delivery?\u201d she asked, her shy voice quiet in the morning hustle and bustle around them.</p><p>\u201cSure is! Courtesy of Beau Lionett.\u201d</p><p>The young woman nodded and started taking a few boxes from Jester. \u201cWas she alright? I heard there was some trouble at the circus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s just fine, it was all a big misunderstanding. Beau\u2019s not gonna let nothing like that get her down!\u201d With her arms full of food she followed the young woman around the back of the shop and into the kitchen which was already a flurry of activity. They sat the boxes down on what little empty counter space they could find and the the young woman walked with Jester back outside.</p><p>\u201cPlease let Miss Lionett know how much we appreciate her kind donation. I wish so much that she could come down and see all the good she\u2019s done around here.\u201d Jester noticed that the redhead was blushing slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about her, is she as kind as they say?\u201d</p><p>Jester wasn\u2019t sure what the people in town knew about her best friend, but when she thought about it she could understand why they had romanticized her slightly. All they knew about her was that she was trapped in her home against her will and donated her things to poor people. They didn\u2019t know that she cursed worse than a sailor and was always one wrong word away from punching most people. Maybe they didn\u2019t need to know those parts. \u201cShe\u2019s so kind, you have no idea. She\u2019s my very best friend and I love her to bits.\u201d</p><p>Jester waved goodbye and climbed back into the carriage, asking the driver to take her to the Gentleman\u2019s tavern. She stepped inside to find it mostly empty at this early hour. The only person inside was the tender at the bar cleaning mugs with a rag. She cleared her throat and stepped inside. \u201cI have a lot of presents,\u201d she said in a hushed whisper. The man gave her an unimpressed look and she suddenly panicked. Had she said it wrong? \u201cI have things to offer? I have\u2026 I brought\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man sighed and waved his hand. \u201cYou come bearing many gifts, yeah, yeah, I get it. Go on in.\u201d</p><p>Jester nodded and hurried down the stairs. It had been just over twelves hours she\u2019d been here last the the scene was remarkably changed. There were people laying over tables, fast asleep and snoring loudly. The floor was sticky with spilled ale and she had to step over a passed out patron laying the middle of the floor. The tall goliath woman from the night before was standing resolute beside the empty throne on the platform. Seeing as she was the only person conscious at the moment, Jester made her way over and cleared her throat. \u201cAh, excuse me? I\u2019m looking for the Gentleman? I have Beau\u2019s notes that she promised him?\u201d The goliath didn\u2019t answer and Jester frowned. \u201cWhy won\u2019t anyone talk to me? Lionett! With the winery stuff. I have the notes he asked for.\u201d</p><p>A door across the room opened with a bang and a groggy genasi man stood in the doorway, his robe hanging open but thankfully with nothing on display below the belt. \u201cWhat is all the ruckus?\u201d</p><p>There was a blonde elf hanging off his hand arm who yawned and rubbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll go get us some coffee, love,\u201d she said, walking around him as he started towards Jester.</p><p>Jester held up the notebook and letter. \u201cFrom Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he grinned, his mood turning. \u201cThat was quick.

Any relation to Marion Lavore?\u201d</p><p>Jester was put off by the sudden mention of her mother but nodded. \u201cYes. The Ruby of the Sea, she\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><p>The Gentleman looked her over with a frown. \u201cHow old are you, Jester Lavore?\u201d</p><p>Jester sneered. She really didn\u2019t like him. \u201cThat\u2019s a rude thing to ask.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but it wasn\u2019t a joyful laugh.

As the horse pulled her towards her final destination, she couldn\u2019t get the conversation with the Gentleman out of her mind. She barely noticed when she arrived at the jail and walked inside on auto pilot. She\u2019d been here a million times, the old man at the counter just waved her through. Jester hummed and skipped as she made her way down the line of cells to the one she knew held her mother. She peeked inside and grinned. \u201cMomma!\u201d</p><p>Marion looked up and smiled softly, sitting aside her knitting and moving to her feet. \u201cJester! My little sapphire, it\u2019s been so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It has been a few weeks. It\u2019s been so busy up at the house.\u201d She slipped her arms through the bars and her mother stepped into them, reaching through the bars to hold each other as close as the metal would allow. She squeezed her face against the bars until her mother moved in to meet her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s from me.\u201d She puckered up again and Marion chuckled but leaned in for another kiss. \u201cThat one is from Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear, give Beauregard my love. I\u2019m just glad I got to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau was in town yesterday.

She frowned and sat up, looking around the room. Caleb was getting dressed at the end of the bed and he winced after a particularly loud bang.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Nott asked, drowsily.</p><p>\u201cBeauregard\u2019s mother locked her in her room after yesterday. \u2018For her own protection\u2019 or so she says.\u201d</p><p>Nott grunted in annoyance and pulled the blanket up over her head. \u201cBeau\u2019s parents suck.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Caleb sighed and finished tying his shoe. \u201cYes, they certainly do. I\u2019m going down to fetch some breakfast, is there anything you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBacon. Bring some for Beau, I\u2019ll take it to her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb seemed surprised by that but nodded. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said as he left the room. He walked down the stairs and easily found the kitchen. Breakfast had come and gone but there were plenty of left overs strewn across the counters.</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen their faces when they walked in and realized they didn\u2019t have to fight.\u201d</p><p>Calab frowned and looked around , catching sight of Beau propped up on the counter with her feet folded under her as Caduceus was sorting food into bags. \u201cBeau?\u201d he asked. He paused and listened closely but there was definitely still thumping coming from the direction he\u2019d come. \u201cI thought-\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and waved dismissively. \u201cAre you kidding? I learned how to pick that lock when I was nine years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid some of the servant\u2019s kids to make as much noise as they wanted. Right now I think they\u2019re taking turns throwing my old dolls at the door as hard as they can. Door\u2019s not even locked any more, they can leave whenever they want.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and picked up a plate of hash browns. \u201cMr. Clay. Good morning.\u201d</p><p>The fibolg gave him a sweet smile. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Caleb. I\u2019m just packing up leftovers to be taken to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTown?\u201d</p><p>Beau nodded and hopped off the counter. \u201cYeah, we always have so much left over. The servants take what they want and whatever is left gets donated in town. Jester is going to take my letter and notes to the Gentleman later today and she\u2019s gonna run these down for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it that this is not your mother\u2019s idea?\u201d</p><p>Beau snorted. \u201cOf course not. My mother thinks charity is the worst thing you can do for another person. If you help them how will they ever learn to take care of themselves?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt was Caduceus\u2019 idea.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped up to Beau and gently touched her elbow. \u201cI\u2019m glad I ran into you. I actually wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>Beau raised an eyebrow and looked back at Caduceus who wasn\u2019t paying them any attention. She put her hand on his shoulder and pushed him out of the kitchen and into the pantry. It could hardly be called a pantry, this room was bigger than his guest room. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you said yesterday sort of\u2026 resonated with me. Made me think about some things. Right now you and I are sort of\u2026 working against one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working with the Gentleman to further both of your goals without being detriment to either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get to the point already!\u201d</p><p>Caleb took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cI want to tell you everything. The reason I agreed to come here, the things I\u2019m looking for. I want to tell you so that you can help me and I will, in turn, help you in anyway that I can to make sure that this scheme with the Gentleman goes off without a hitch.</p><p>She gave him an unsure look up and down. \u201cReally? You\u2019re not fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNein. I will tell you the truth, everything you need to know to understand what I\u2019m doing here and why.\u201d</p><p>Beau didn\u2019t answer right away, which we was surprised about. She was surprising him a lot lately but he hadn\u2019t considered her a think-before-you-act kind of person. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that we should continue this engagement facade for a few weeks longer.\u201d</p><p>Beau grimaced. \u201cMy mom is already planning the wedding. If we drag this out any longer she\u2019ll start putting in deposits and shit, you can\u2019t get those back. She\u2019ll be pissed at me. She might actually kill me. Well\u2026\u201d she paused thoughtfully like she was actually considering the method with which her mother would kill her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like to get her hands dirty. She\u2019d make someone else do it, but I would definitely die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a week then. This time next week I will be out of your hair forever and you can go back to terrorizing suitors until your winery deal gets on its feet.\u201d</p><p>Beau bit the inside of her cheek and started tapping her foot nervously. \u201cOkay, okay, okay,\u201d she mumbled, looking away from him and rubbing her hands together. She seemed to come to a conclusion and nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d She reached out to shake his hand.</p><p>He took it and they shook on it. \u201cGreat. Meet me in the library after dinner. Come alone.\u201d</p><p>She sneered. \u201cCould you have said that more ominously?\u201d But she turned and left anyway. \u201cSee you in the library.\u201d</p><p>Jester was talking happily with Caduceus when she stepped out of the pantry. She grinned at Beau when she caught her eye. \u201cThere you are! I was just about to head out but I wanted to see you before I left, I won\u2019t be back until late. I\u2019m gonna visit Momma while I\u2019m in town, do you want me say anything to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give her a kiss for me, like usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, Snuggly-poo.\u201d She giggled at her rhyme. \u201cI have the notebook you gave me and the letter for the Gentleman. Now I have the food for the Food Kitchen. I think that\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus nodded and handed her the boxes of food. \u201cSounds like everything.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped out into the kitchen after Beau and frowned as Jester was loaded down with food. \u201cWill you be able to carry that the whole way?\u201d</p><p>Jester grinned at him and shifted the boxes into one arm so that she could flex the other. \u201cI\u2019m super strong! Beau and I work out together a lot because there\u2019s, like, nothing else to do around here when there aren\u2019t suitors to chase away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long trip though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are staff carriages for stuff like this. It\u2019s not as big or luxurious as the one we took yesterday but it\u2019ll do the job,\u201d Beau said, walking over to take a few boxes from her best friend. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get these to the carriage at least. Caleb, don\u2019t forget our deal.\u201d Then they both turned to leave.</p><p>Caleb frowned. \u201cI won\u2019t forget it, it was my idea.\u201d</p><p>She just flipped him off while balancing the boxes on her arm and then they were gone out the back door.</p><p>Jester hummed happily to herself as the carriage pulled up to a stop in front of the Food Kitchen. A young woman with long red hair that draped elegantly over her shoulders came out the front door with a smile as Jester climbed down.</p><p>\u201cLionett delivery?\u201d she asked, her shy voice quiet in the morning hustle and bustle around them.</p><p>\u201cSure is! Courtesy of Beau Lionett.\u201d</p><p>The young woman nodded and started taking a few boxes from Jester. \u201cWas she alright? I heard there was some trouble at the circus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s just fine, it was all a big misunderstanding. Beau\u2019s not gonna let nothing like that get her down!\u201d With her arms full of food she followed the young woman around the back of the shop and into the kitchen which was already a flurry of activity. They sat the boxes down on what little empty counter space they could find and the the young woman walked with Jester back outside.</p><p>\u201cPlease let Miss Lionett know how much we appreciate her kind donation. I wish so much that she could come down and see all the good she\u2019s done around here.\u201d Jester noticed that the redhead was blushing slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about her, is she as kind as they say?\u201d</p><p>Jester wasn\u2019t sure what the people in town knew about her best friend, but when she thought about it she could understand why they had romanticized her slightly. All they knew about her was that she was trapped in her home against her will and donated her things to poor people. They didn\u2019t know that she cursed worse than a sailor and was always one wrong word away from punching most people. Maybe they didn\u2019t need to know those parts. \u201cShe\u2019s so kind, you have no idea. She\u2019s my very best friend and I love her to bits.\u201d</p><p>Jester waved goodbye and climbed back into the carriage, asking the driver to take her to the Gentleman\u2019s tavern. She stepped inside to find it mostly empty at this early hour. The only person inside was the tender at the bar cleaning mugs with a rag. She cleared her throat and stepped inside. \u201cI have a lot of presents,\u201d she said in a hushed whisper. The man gave her an unimpressed look and she suddenly panicked. Had she said it wrong? \u201cI have things to offer? I have\u2026 I brought\u2026\u201d</p><p>The man sighed and waved his hand. \u201cYou come bearing many gifts, yeah, yeah, I get it. Go on in.\u201d</p><p>Jester nodded and hurried down the stairs. It had been just over twelves hours she\u2019d been here last the the scene was remarkably changed. There were people laying over tables, fast asleep and snoring loudly. The floor was sticky with spilled ale and she had to step over a passed out patron laying the middle of the floor. The tall goliath woman from the night before was standing resolute beside the empty throne on the platform. Seeing as she was the only person conscious at the moment, Jester made her way over and cleared her throat. \u201cAh, excuse me? I\u2019m looking for the Gentleman? I have Beau\u2019s notes that she promised him?\u201d The goliath didn\u2019t answer and Jester frowned. \u201cWhy won\u2019t anyone talk to me? Lionett! With the winery stuff. I have the notes he asked for.\u201d</p><p>A door across the room opened with a bang and a groggy genasi man stood in the doorway, his robe hanging open but thankfully with nothing on display below the belt. \u201cWhat is all the ruckus?\u201d</p><p>There was a blonde elf hanging off his hand arm who yawned and rubbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll go get us some coffee, love,\u201d she said, walking around him as he started towards Jester.</p><p>Jester held up the notebook and letter. \u201cFrom Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he grinned, his mood turning. \u201cThat was quick. It\u2019s nice to know that young Beauregard can be trusted to be prompt at the very least. What was your name again, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJester.\u201d</p><p>He nodded absently as he flipped through Beau\u2019s notes. \u201cJester. Jester what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavore.\u201d</p><p>He paused. Well, more like froze. His eyes were wide when he looked at her. \u201cLavore? Any relation to Marion Lavore?\u201d</p><p>Jester was put off by the sudden mention of her mother but nodded. \u201cYes. The Ruby of the Sea, she\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><p>The Gentleman looked her over with a frown. \u201cHow old are you, Jester Lavore?\u201d</p><p>Jester sneered. She really didn\u2019t like him. \u201cThat\u2019s a rude thing to ask.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but it wasn\u2019t a joyful laugh. It was sad and nearly made her feel sorry for him. \u201cYes, you were certainly raised by dear Marion, alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew her?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be jolted out of whatever reverie he was in and shook his head. \u201cNo, no, of course not. I\u2019ve heard of her. Thank you for the delivery, you may go now.\u201d</p><p>Jester was still frowning but she left the way that she came and when she climbed back into the carriage she told the driver to take her to one last stop. \u201cThe city jail, please,\u201d she called. As the horse pulled her towards her final destination, she couldn\u2019t get the conversation with the Gentleman out of her mind. She barely noticed when she arrived at the jail and walked inside on auto pilot. She\u2019d been here a million times, the old man at the counter just waved her through. Jester hummed and skipped as she made her way down the line of cells to the one she knew held her mother. She peeked inside and grinned. \u201cMomma!\u201d</p><p>Marion looked up and smiled softly, sitting aside her knitting and moving to her feet. \u201cJester! My little sapphire, it\u2019s been so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It has been a few weeks. It\u2019s been so busy up at the house.\u201d She slipped her arms through the bars and her mother stepped into them, reaching through the bars to hold each other as close as the metal would allow. She squeezed her face against the bars until her mother moved in to meet her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s from me.\u201d She puckered up again and Marion chuckled but leaned in for another kiss. \u201cThat one is from Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my dear, give Beauregard my love. I\u2019m just glad I got to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau was in town yesterday. Her mother let her go to the carnival.\u201d </p><p>Marion gasped as she pulled away. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry she couldn\u2019t come see me. I heard there was some trouble at the carnival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, Beau got kidnapped! By this blue sweaty guy. We had to break in and get her it was super cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, that sounds like a grand adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she ended up saving herself, so it wasn\u2019t as fun as it would have been if we\u2019d killed everyone in a blaze of glory.\u201d</p><p>Marion chuckled and reached up to run her hand down her daughter\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m glad you had fun dear. Is she doing better now? I\u2019m so worried about her, stuck in that house with those people.\u201d</p><p>Jester sighed and leaned her forehead against the bar in front of her. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 I won\u2019t say she\u2019s better exactly, technically. She shaved the bottom of her hair, or, technically, I shaved the bottom of her hair but it was her idea. She\u2019s more comfortable than I\u2019ve ever seen her now. She made a new friend too.\u201d</p><p>Marion looked surprised. \u201cReally? Beau?\u201d</p><p>Jester giggled. \u201cYeah, yeah, his name is Caleb and they played a fun game the other day. She likes him even though she pretends she doesn\u2019t. He has a goblin for a mom. But she\u2019s super sweet, she\u2019s not like other goblins.\u201d</p><p>Marion didn\u2019t seem to understand but she smiled and kissed her daughter\u2019s forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice, dear. Have you made any new friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 you know about Fjord. I really like Caleb and Nott too, they\u2019re super great. Ooh, and at the carnival I met some people named Yasha and Mollymauk.\u201d</p><p>A voice called out from farther down the line of cells. \u201cWas that my name I heard?\u201d</p><p>Jester blinked in surprise and pulled away from her mother. \u201cMolly?\u201d</p></p>",

Caleb, don&rsquo;t forget our deal.&rdquo; Then they both turned to leave.</p><p>Caleb frowned. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget it, it was my idea.&rdquo;</p><p>She just flipped him off while balancing the boxes on her arm and then they were gone out the back door.</p><p>Jester hummed happily to herself as the carriage pulled up to a stop in front of the Food Kitchen. A young woman with long red hair that draped elegantly over her shoulders came out the front door with a smile as Jester climbed down.</p><p>&ldquo;Lionett delivery?&rdquo; she asked, her shy voice quiet in the morning hustle and bustle around them.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure is! Courtesy of Beau Lionett.&rdquo;</p><p>The young woman nodded and started taking a few boxes from Jester. &ldquo;Was she alright? I heard there was some trouble at the circus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s just fine, it was all a big misunderstanding. Beau&rsquo;s not gonna let nothing like that get her down!&rdquo; With her arms full of food she followed the young woman around the back of the shop and into the kitchen which was already a flurry of activity. They sat the boxes down on what little empty counter space they could find and the the young woman walked with Jester back outside.</p><p>&ldquo;Please let Miss Lionett know how much we appreciate her kind donation. I wish so much that she could come down and see all the good she&rsquo;s done around here.&rdquo; Jester noticed that the redhead was blushing slightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so much about her, is she as kind as they say?&rdquo;</p><p>Jester wasn&rsquo;t sure what the people in town knew about her best friend, but when she thought about it she could understand why they had romanticized her slightly. All they knew about her was that she was trapped in her home against her will and donated her things to poor people. They didn&rsquo;t know that she cursed worse than a sailor and was always one wrong word away from punching most people. Maybe they didn&rsquo;t need to know those parts. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so kind, you have no idea. She&rsquo;s my very best friend and I love her to bits.&rdquo;</p><p>Jester waved goodbye and climbed back into the carriage, asking the driver to take her to the Gentleman&rsquo;s tavern. She stepped inside to find it mostly empty at this early hour. The only person inside was the tender at the bar cleaning mugs with a rag. She cleared her throat and stepped inside. &ldquo;I have a lot of presents,&rdquo; she said in a hushed whisper. The man gave her an unimpressed look and she suddenly panicked. Had she said it wrong? &ldquo;I have things to offer? I have&hellip; I brought&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The man sighed and waved his hand. &ldquo;You come bearing many gifts, yeah, yeah, I get it. Go on in.&rdquo;</p><p>Jester nodded and hurried down the stairs. It had been just over twelves hours she&rsquo;d been here last the the scene was remarkably changed. There were people laying over tables, fast asleep and snoring loudly. The floor was sticky with spilled ale and she had to step over a passed out patron laying the middle of the floor. The tall goliath woman from the night before was standing resolute beside the empty throne on the platform. Seeing as she was the only person conscious at the moment, Jester made her way over and cleared her throat. &ldquo;Ah, excuse me? I&rsquo;m looking for the Gentleman? I have Beau&rsquo;s notes that she promised him?&rdquo; The goliath didn&rsquo;t answer and Jester frowned. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t anyone talk to me? Lionett! With the winery stuff. I have the notes he asked for.&rdquo;</p><p>A door across the room opened with a bang and a groggy genasi man stood in the doorway, his robe hanging open but thankfully with nothing on display below the belt. &ldquo;What is all the ruckus?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a blonde elf hanging off his hand arm who yawned and rubbed her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get us some coffee, love,&rdquo; she said, walking around him as he started towards Jester.</p><p>Jester held up the notebook and letter. &ldquo;From Beau.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he grinned, his mood turning. &ldquo;That was quick. It&rsquo;s nice to know that young Beauregard can be trusted to be prompt at the very least. What was your name again, dear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jester.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded absently as he flipped through Beau&rsquo;s notes. &ldquo;Jester. Jester what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lavore.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused. Well, more like froze. His eyes were wide when he looked at her. &ldquo;Lavore? Any relation to Marion Lavore?&rdquo;</p><p>Jester was put off by the sudden mention of her mother but nodded. &ldquo;Yes. The Ruby of the Sea, she&rsquo;s my mother.&rdquo;</p><p>The Gentleman looked her over with a frown. &ldquo;How old are you, Jester Lavore?&rdquo;</p><p>Jester sneered. She really didn&rsquo;t like him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rude thing to ask.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed, but it wasn&rsquo;t a joyful laugh. It was sad and nearly made her feel sorry for him. &ldquo;Yes, you were certainly raised by dear Marion, alright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You knew her?&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed to be jolted out of whatever reverie he was in and shook his head. &ldquo;No, no, of course not. I&rsquo;ve heard of her. Thank you for the delivery, you may go now.&rdquo;</p><p>Jester was still frowning but she left the way that she came and when she climbed back into the carriage she told the driver to take her to one last stop. &ldquo;The city jail, please,&rdquo; she called. As the horse pulled her towards her final destination, she couldn&rsquo;t get the conversation with the Gentleman out of her mind. She barely noticed when she arrived at the jail and walked inside on auto pilot. She&rsquo;d been here a million times, the old man at the counter just waved her through. Jester hummed and skipped as she made her way down the line of cells to the one she knew held her mother. She peeked inside and grinned. &ldquo;Momma!&rdquo;</p><p>Marion looked up and smiled softly, sitting aside her knitting and moving to her feet. &ldquo;Jester! My little sapphire, it&rsquo;s been so long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. It has been a few weeks. It&rsquo;s been so busy up at the house.&rdquo; She slipped her arms through the bars and her mother stepped into them, reaching through the bars to hold each other as close as the metal would allow. She squeezed her face against the bars until her mother moved in to meet her lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s from me.&rdquo; She puckered up again and Marion chuckled but leaned in for another kiss. &ldquo;That one is from Beau.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear, give Beauregard my love. I&rsquo;m just glad I got to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beau was in town yesterday. Her mother let her go to the carnival.&rdquo; </p><p>Marion gasped as she pulled away. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry she couldn&rsquo;t come see me. I heard there was some trouble at the carnival.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, Beau got kidnapped! By this blue sweaty guy. We had to break in and get her it was super cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My, that sounds like a grand adventure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she ended up saving herself, so it wasn&rsquo;t as fun as it would have been if we&rsquo;d killed everyone in a blaze of glory.&rdquo;</p><p>Marion chuckled and reached up to run her hand down her daughter&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you had fun dear. Is she doing better now? I&rsquo;m so worried about her, stuck in that house with those people.&rdquo;</p><p>Jester sighed and leaned her forehead against the bar in front of her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip; I won&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s better exactly, technically. She shaved the bottom of her hair, or, technically, I shaved the bottom of her hair but it was her idea. She&rsquo;s more comfortable than I&rsquo;ve ever seen her now. She made a new friend too.&rdquo;</p><p>Marion looked surprised. &ldquo;Really? Beau?&rdquo;</p><p>Jester giggled. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, his name is Caleb and they played a fun game the other day. She likes him even though she pretends she doesn&rsquo;t. He has a goblin for a mom. But she&rsquo;s super sweet, she&rsquo;s not like other goblins.&rdquo;</p><p>Marion didn&rsquo;t seem to understand but she smiled and kissed her daughter&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice, dear. Have you made any new friends?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; you know about Fjord. I really like Caleb and Nott too, they&rsquo;re super great. Ooh, and at the carnival I met some people named Yasha and Mollymauk.&rdquo;</p><p>A voice called out from farther down the line of cells. &ldquo;Was that my name I heard?&rdquo;</p><p>Jester blinked in surprise and pulled away from her mother. &ldquo;Molly?&rdquo;</p></p>",
