                "content": "<p>Most of the &ldquo;Male Extra&rdquo; reviews you find on the internet are copy cats that scream buy. Can you trust them? As a discerning consumer, I hope you are not taken in by them. In fact, you should not buy this penile enhancement pill until and unless your find out what it really is. This article aims to do just that.</p><p>In this short Male Extra review, we will take a no-nonsense look at this relatively new male enhancement pill and see if it worth anything or not.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fa119343b45e6ddbd79028a380a67a4/tumblr_inline_piagr6tQUB1uxd7fs_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>1. What do you get when you order Male Extra?</h2><p>Basically, you get two things:</p><p>i) the Male Extra pills which are penis enhancement supplements <br />ii) Penis-health program which is a penis enlargement exercise site that is well known to help men enlarge their penises without surgery.</p><h2>2. Reputation of vendor</h2><p>Permanda LTD, a company registered in England and Wales as a Limited Liability Company, is a long time seller of health products online. <a href=\"https://goldencondor.org/testoultra/\">Testoultra</a> This company has a good reputation and offers excellent customer support. At least on this score, Male Extra appears to be a trustworthy product.</p><h2>3. Benefits and ingredients</h2><p>Strangely enough, the vendor&rsquo;s website does not list any specific benefits for the user. But if you take a look at the ingredients list, you will find that they are a special blend of aphrodisiac and other herbal compounds.</p><p>Ingredients like Zinc and Coryceps can help boost your body&rsquo;s sexual functions, including improving your blood flow for a harder erections, getting a higher libido, etc. Other ingredients are good for your general health and can help lower cholesterol and body fat too.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9cc514e38c7de507cdd6920e1fe4aa51/tumblr_inline_piagrdLHlx1uxd7fs_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In addition, you can also benefit from the Penis-health program. How so? This program is well known for its penis enlargement exercises called &ldquo;Jelqing&rdquo;. You can do these exercises to strengthen your erections, improve your sexual stamina in bed or even to enlarge your penis size.</p><h2>4. Endorsements by the medical community</h2><p>Male Extra does not seem to be endorsed by any doctors so far. This could be because it is a relatively new product and not so well known. Nonetheless, this is a red herring you should be aware of.</p><h2>5. Customer testimonials</h2><p>Strangely enough, we can&rsquo;t find any customer testimonials so far. This could change with time as more people get to use this product. For now, this is a neutral factor.</p><h2>6. Money back guarantees, if any</h2><p>Male Extra does comes with a 6 month, risk-free, money back guarantee. In other words, you can try this product without worrying about losing your hard earned cash on something worthless. But to be fair to the vendor, you do need to use the product for 3 months to show that you have actually used it and not benefited from it at all during this time.</p><h2>7. Negative side effects</h2><p>Since Male Extra is a herbal supplement, you will not get the nasty effects associated with prescription drugs like Viagra. However, you may feel a bit thirsty on swallowing the pills on the first few attempts. Therefore you must drink lots of water when taking the pills.</p><p>Conclusions and recommendations</p><p>As you can see in this short Male Extra review, you can certainly get some benefits out of this relatively new product. If you need to have harder erections and a higher sex drive, this product can help. But if you want to grow a permanently bigger penis size, then you must remember to do the enlargement exercises that come with the pills.</p><p>This is because the pills alone cannot help you grow a bigger penis. But if you combine them with the excellent penile exercises from the free Penis-health program, you will get optimal results.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6487429a12b7e2b0fc0e771f3759bcef/tumblr_inline_piagrm9Fh31uxd7fs_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />Despite not having any endorsements from the medical community so far, this product does seem like a legitimate product that can work. Perhaps with time, this product will catch the eyes of the medical community as it is still relatively unknown.</p><p>If you like the ingredients in the pills or the Penis-health program, you may want to give this product a try. After all, it comes with a money back guarantee that is excellent by industry standards.</p><p>So you too are a victim of smaller penis, early ejaculations, softer erections or maybe lower orgasms?

Since 2015, so over 3 years now.</p><p><b>Can you describe your career journey to becoming a SHEQ Manager?</b></p><p>I started in the construction industry as a trainee contracts manager in about 1991, aged 17. I spent four or five years on site learning all the various different trades before I went into contracts management, looking after building refurbishment projects throughout the UK and overseas.</p><p>For a few years, I traveled the world with work. I spent a lot of time in Germany. It was the first overseas project I worked on. I then spent a bit of time in Moscow, Switzerland, Jamaica, and Africa. I\u2019m sure there&rsquo;s loads of others that I can&rsquo;t remember but they&rsquo;re the main ones that spring to mind.</p><p>I first got involved in health and safety in 2007 in my previous role working for a steeplejack company. That was pretty much as a direct result of the company I was working for having to deal with a serious incident. They asked me to complete my CITB SMSTS training and NEBOSH General Certificate. \u00a0I then took on the role of health and safety coordinator.</p><p>As my career progressed, I self-funded my NVQ Level 5 to get to the level I wanted to be at and then started to look for a dedicated role within health and safety.</p><p><b>How would you describe a typical day in your role as SHEQ Manager?</b></p><p>Up until recently, my role as health and safety manager typically involved site inspection or auditing of the existing management system, and ensuring compliance with the latest standards. \u00a0It also involved investigation of accidents, incidents and near misses and then looking at ways to continue to improve the safety culture of the organisation, as well as providing health and safety advice to all levels within the organisation.</p><p>With my role as SHEQ Manager, going forward my first job will be to carry out a gap analysis on the existing system and look at how we can streamline and improve the system within the organisation, moving more toward an electronic version of the three systems that are then integrated with each other.</p><p><b>What do you think have been your biggest achievements so far in your time at Geotechnics?</b></p><p>The obvious one is going to be the <a href=\"https://www.geotechnics.co.uk/go-safe/all-campaigns\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">GO SAFE campaign</a> developed between myself and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davecage/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Cage</a>, our Business Development Manager. I\u2019m proud of where it&rsquo;s taking the culture of the organization.</p><p>Going forward in my new role there may be a different twist. We might incorporate environmental and quality issues into GO SAFE, or as an offshoot. That&rsquo;s the whole idea of integrating the systems. I&rsquo;m looking at how we can bring the quality and environmental into inspections and what new topics could be addressed. Waste is one topic that comes to mind.</p><p><b>What is your favourite part of your job?</b></p><p>I like the interaction with different people. I still like getting out on site and there\u2019s always a nice variety of site locations to visit. I don\u2019t like being stuck in one location all the time. It\u2019s something I&rsquo;m very keen not to lose as I take on my new role.</p><p>There\u2019s definitely a contrast between dealing with people on site and being in a senior management role, dealing with strategy and decision making for the whole organisation. Being able to communicate at all levels is key to improving the culture of the organisation.</p><p><b>What advice would you give to someone taking their first steps in the construction industry, and specifically SHEQ management?</b></p><p>There is now is a student route into <a href=\"https://www.iosh.co.uk/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">IOSH (the International Organization for Safety and Health)</a>, but I would personally advocate that people need to have relevant construction industry experience before locking on to a career in health and safety. I think it gives you a good technical knowledge of how to control hazards before you start going down a dedicated health and safety route.</p><p><b>What do you think are the biggest changes and challenges within the industry going forward?</b></p><p>I think from a health and safety perspective the focus recently seems to have started to move more away from the safety and some of the challenges going forward are going to be related more towards well-being and health. It\u2019s key that we focus our attention on increasing our understanding of mental health and wider occupational health issues.</p><p>One of the other biggest changes will be the introduction of technology on sites to handle the large amounts of data we produce and to assist us in moving away from paper documents. \u00a0Over the next few months we will be trialing the use of tablet computers on site to give engineers access to all the company standard documents and forms.</p><p><b>What do you like to do outside of work?</b></p><p>I do quite a lot for IOSH in my current volunteer role as a committee member with the <a href=\"https://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/Our-membership-network/Our-Branches/Manchester-and-North-West-Districts-Branch.aspx\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Manchester and North West district branch of IOSH</a>. \u00a0I also act as a chair and panel member on the PRI (Peer Review Interview) panel for charterships. Within the last couple of weeks, I&rsquo;ve also taken on a role as a registered mentor for people wanting to achieve chartered status.</p><p>Outside of work my focus at the moment is around running and fitness.

They asked me to complete my CITB SMSTS training and NEBOSH General Certificate. &nbsp;I then took on the role of health and safety coordinator.</p><p>As my career progressed, I self-funded my NVQ Level 5 to get to the level I wanted to be at and then started to look for a dedicated role within health and safety.</p><p><b>How would you describe a typical day in your role as SHEQ Manager?</b></p><p>Up until recently, my role as health and safety manager typically involved site inspection or auditing of the existing management system, and ensuring compliance with the latest standards. &nbsp;It also involved investigation of accidents, incidents and near misses and then looking at ways to continue to improve the safety culture of the organisation, as well as providing health and safety advice to all levels within the organisation.</p><p>With my role as SHEQ Manager, going forward my first job will be to carry out a gap analysis on the existing system and look at how we can streamline and improve the system within the organisation, moving more toward an electronic version of the three systems that are then integrated with each other.</p><p><b>What do you think have been your biggest achievements so far in your time at Geotechnics?</b></p><p>The obvious one is going to be the <a href=\"https://www.geotechnics.co.uk/go-safe/all-campaigns\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">GO SAFE campaign</a> developed between myself and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davecage/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Cage</a>, our Business Development Manager. I&rsquo;m proud of where it&rsquo;s taking the culture of the organization.</p><p>Going forward in my new role there may be a different twist. We might incorporate environmental and quality issues into GO SAFE, or as an offshoot. That&rsquo;s the whole idea of integrating the systems. I&rsquo;m looking at how we can bring the quality and environmental into inspections and what new topics could be addressed. Waste is one topic that comes to mind.</p><p><b>What is your favourite part of your job?</b></p><p>I like the interaction with different people. I still like getting out on site and there&rsquo;s always a nice variety of site locations to visit. I don&rsquo;t like being stuck in one location all the time. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m very keen not to lose as I take on my new role.</p><p>There&rsquo;s definitely a contrast between dealing with people on site and being in a senior management role, dealing with strategy and decision making for the whole organisation. Being able to communicate at all levels is key to improving the culture of the organisation.</p><p><b>What advice would you give to someone taking their first steps in the construction industry, and specifically SHEQ management?</b></p><p>There is now is a student route into <a href=\"https://www.iosh.co.uk/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">IOSH (the International Organization for Safety and Health)</a>, but I would personally advocate that people need to have relevant construction industry experience before locking on to a career in health and safety. I think it gives you a good technical knowledge of how to control hazards before you start going down a dedicated health and safety route.</p><p><b>What do you think are the biggest changes and challenges within the industry going forward?</b></p><p>I think from a health and safety perspective the focus recently seems to have started to move more away from the safety and some of the challenges going forward are going to be related more towards well-being and health. It&rsquo;s key that we focus our attention on increasing our understanding of mental health and wider occupational health issues.</p><p>One of the other biggest changes will be the introduction of technology on sites to handle the large amounts of data we produce and to assist us in moving away from paper documents. &nbsp;Over the next few months we will be trialing the use of tablet computers on site to give engineers access to all the company standard documents and forms.</p><p><b>What do you like to do outside of work?</b></p><p>I do quite a lot for IOSH in my current volunteer role as a committee member with the <a href=\"https://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/Our-membership-network/Our-Branches/Manchester-and-North-West-Districts-Branch.aspx\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Manchester and North West district branch of IOSH</a>. &nbsp;I also act as a chair and panel member on the PRI (Peer Review Interview) panel for charterships. Within the last couple of weeks, I&rsquo;ve also taken on a role as a registered mentor for people wanting to achieve chartered status.</p><p>Outside of work my focus at the moment is around running and fitness. I&rsquo;ve already entered an event in September next year to run up Snowdon.</p><p><b>What advice do you have for anyone looking to become chartered?</b></p><p>If we&rsquo;re looking at the interview panels and the types of people we get in I think that candidates tend to try and over-complicate the answers and I think that maybe sometimes they would benefit from going back to basic core health and safety knowledge.</p><p><b>What is a surprising fact that people might not know about you?</b></p><p>Well, I completed the London Marathon in 2002 with my parents and raised money for a local hospital where my son was born.</p></p>",
