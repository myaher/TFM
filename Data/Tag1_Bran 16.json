I hope you enjoyed! Also since it is set in Dorne, I would like to remind you that when I use the word\u00a0\u201cPrince\u201d I am referring to the Lord/Lady of Dorne. In Westerosi history, since the Dornish kingdom had a different history with joining the rest of Westeros, they were allowed to keep the title of Prince instead of calling themselves Lords. It is not speaking in terms of lineage to the Westerosi throne. Okay, nerdy lesson over!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"433\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/38ed7ee5ccbfb79b7e993ecd6bc21d22/tumblr_inline_pszxm5N6uO1usoepp_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"433\"/></figure><p>Finally, all the wars were over. The Night King was dead, and so was Cersei Lannister. In Dorne, your new Prince had been put in place and things were seeming to shape up nicely. After years of fear, fighting, and uprisings, you finally felt safe.</p><p>As the lands of Westeros were becoming safe once again, your new King announced that he would be touring all of the six kingdoms as well as the North. Despite the past problems between the throne and the southern kingdom of Dorne, you were anxious to meet the new King. He came from house Stark, an honorable house which you had never had a problem with. He had only been king less than a year, but you were sure that he had already done a better job than Cersei. You hated that dreadful woman. You blamed her for the death of Prince Oberyn Martell, and consequently the rebellion that erupted from the sand snakes that led to the murder of the rest of your governing family.</p><p>You brushed thoughts of her from your mind, focusing instead on the matter at hand. King Brandon Stark would be at the castle by late tomorrow morning. As a hired hand in Sunspear\u2019s Old Palace this meant plenty of work for you, from sweeping the floors to making sure that every flower arrangement was situated perfectly. You were hosting a king after all; everything had to be absolutely perfect.</p><p>You rushed around the palace like a madwoman, furiously cleaning everything until it gleamed and shined. You worked until you thought your limbs might give out, working tirelessly until sundown when you were finally able to return to your quarters.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d called an elderly voice, making you turn to find the source.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You called out, your voice echoing in the empty hallway. An older woman stepped out of the shadows, one that you knew quite well. She was the head of all the other maids, having worked in the palace for most of her life. When you were a scared young girl in need of work, she was the one who had taken you under her wing. She secured you a job in the castle, and helped you hold onto it as power switched hands.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNan!\u201d You smiled, rushing over to give the woman a hug. She returned the hug, holding you tightly as she smiled fondly at the nickname you and the other girls had given her.<br/></p><p>\u201cHello my dear,\u201d she greeted you as you pulled away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever,\u201d you said,\u00a0\u201cthanks to these long hours preparing for King Brandon, I presume.\u201d She sighed.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes my dear, it doesn\u2019t help that we always end up cleaning opposite ends of the castle,\u201d she said with her warm smile that made you feel at home.\u00a0\u201cBut I had to see you before the feast tomorrow.\u201d Your face fell.</p><p>\u201cAbout the feast,\u201d you revealed,\u00a0\u201cI do not plan on attending.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Screeched Nan, making you jump as the usually quiet woman raised her voice at you.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean you aren\u2019t going? The Prince has even excused you from going as a server!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, but-\u201d You started, but Nan cut you off.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo buts! You get to attend this feast as a single woman, and an attractive one at that. I am not letting you wiggle your way out of this.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d fit in there,\u201d you admitted.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not so sure that I belong in the same room as a King and all the richest people in Dorne. I don\u2019t even have anything to wear.\u201d You gestured to the rags you wore, but as you turned back to Nan\u2019s eyes she was smiling knowingly.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called out to you Y/N, I think I may have something that could help.\u201d<br/></p><p>You followed Nan to her chambers which were thankfully rather close to your own so you did not stray too far out of your way. There was a fire lit in the fireplace, illuminating the room in a soft, warm glow. You looked to the bed to only to find the most gorgeous dress that you had ever seen. You couldn\u2019t help the gasp that came from your mouth.</p><p>\u201cNan,\u201d you whispered.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is the dress I was wearing when I first met my dear late husband. At a feast not unlike this one, might I add.\u201d Nan reminisced with a smile.\u00a0\u201cIf you would accept, I would like you to wear it tomorrow evening.\u201d You spun to face her, shocked.<br/></p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou are a beautiful girl Y/N, and you deserve a beautiful dress for such an occasion. You only meet the King once, after all. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to look stunning in front of Dorne\u2019s wealthy when you are of marrying age.\u201d<br/></p><p>You blushed at Nan\u2019s words, but you had to admit that you were excited at the prospect. The gown was absolutely perfect. It was covered in swirling patterns that captured the eye, the background fabric your favorite color. You knew that it would look just as nice on you as Nan promised. And she was right, after all. You were of marrying age. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to get dressed up for potential suitors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear it,\u201d you agreed as Nan clasped her hands together excitedly before pushing the dress into your arms.<br/></p><p>\u201cGood luck then dearie,\u201d she called,\u00a0\u201cseduce you a good one!\u201d<br/></p><p>You blushed at her forward words, gathering the dress in your arms before making your way to your own room. You had been dreading tomorrow night, deciding to keep to yourself in your room all night. Now, you couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>The next morning you woke up in a good mood. The sun streamed in through your window ad the birds chirped, making you feel as if you were living a fantasy. You took your time getting ready, preparing yourself for the King\u2019s arrival. Once you were satisfied with your hair and outfit, you made your way down to where the rest of the palace was lining up. You had thought about wearing your new dress, but decided to save it for this evening alone.</p><p>As the carriages passed, you craned your neck to see a glimpse of the royal party but to no avail. Anybody of any real importance seemed to all have their windows darkened or their curtains drawn shut. All except for Bran, that was. As he passed you could see him clearly. His eyes locked onto yours, and you felt a smile come to your face. He gave you a small smile back as he carriage proceeded towards the castle. Although it was only for a moment, something about the way he looked at you took your breath away.</p><p>You shook the feeling, not allowing yourself to think about Bran that way. He was the King, and you were a lowly servant girl in Dorne. He just happened to meet your eyes was all, as he surely did to countless people trying to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p>You eagerly awaited the start of the feast, changing into the dress that Nan had given you. It looked even more beautiful on you. It hugged your body in the right places, but it was still modest. You weren\u2019t <i>that</i>\u00a0desperate. When it was finally time you strolled through the hallways towards the banquet room with a smile, trying to forget how you hoped to see the King again. See his soft brown eyes, his dark hair that you just wanted to run your hands through.</p><p>After you entered, you wandered aimlessly. You never went to these kinds of parties; the only times you did were as a server or a maid. This meant that you knew nobody, and the longer you were there, the more you wanted to leave. This had been your fear, and it was coming true.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood evening Gorgeous,\u201d came a deep voice from your left. You turned to face the Lord, smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d you replied.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met you before,\u201d he flirted, handing you a glass of wine.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMy name is Y/N L/N,\u201d you told him as you took a sip of the drink.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, your name is just as beautiful as you are.\u201d Your cheeks dusted crimson, smiling at him. He told you his name as well, revealing to you that he had made quite a fortune in buying and selling ships. If he was trying to impress you, it sure was working.</p><p>You talked to the man for what felt like an hour, but it surely couldn\u2019t have been that long. You stopped drinking after your second glass, always drinking slowly to avoid becoming too intoxicated. This man did not do the same, drinking glass after glass as if it were just water. He quickly became drunk, becoming much more handsy as he drank more. At first it was tolerable, a light touch on the arm. However, he continued to drink and he continued to become more inappropriate. His hands would wander to your waist, and when he asked you to dance his hands would wander lower as you swayed. You kept moving his hands back up, but every time they strayed lower again and again. Agitated, you tried to excuse yourself from the conversation.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yelled the man in a drunken rage.\u00a0\u201cAm I not good enough for you?\u201d You froze as others turned to look at you.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m just going to go grab some-\u201d You said, trying to lie before you were interrupted by the drunk Lord.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou damn whore! You can\u2019t lie to save your life.\u201d He started stalking towards you as you backed up in fear.\u00a0\u201cCome back here, you cunt!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cExcuse me, my Lord,\u201d came a voice from behind you. You were startled, jumping aside wide-eyed. Even more startling to you was that as you turned towards the voice, you saw King Brandon Stark looking towards the Lord who had been causing you trouble.\u00a0\u201cIs there an issue over here?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d spat the Lord.\u00a0\u201cThis dumb cunt has been leading me on all night, and now she thinks that she can just walk away from me.\u201d<br/></p><p>You looked towards King Bran with wide, scared eyes, too afraid to tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d said the King. The Lord smirked, thinking that he had gotten his way. The smirk was quickly wiped from his face as the King continued,\u00a0\u201cyou are excused from the feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yelled the Lord in shock.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you just tell me? You can\u2019t say that!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAs King, I believe that I am allowed to say that. At my own feast, no less.\u201d As the man looked ready to argue more, King Bran continued calmly.\u00a0\u201cGuards,\u201d he said. You always expected people to yell for their guards, but he asked for them the same way you would expect him to greet anyone. They quickly came to his aid, whisking the other man away.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright, my Lady?\u201d Asked the King as he turned his full attention to you.<br/></p><p>\u201cI think I am now. Thank you, your Majesty,\u201d you said with a curtsy.\u00a0\u201cBut I am no Lady.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThen who are you?\u201d Asked the King. You were just shocked that he was still talking to you.<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N L/N, I\u2019m just a servant who was allowed to attend as a guest,\u201d you said, embarrassed.<br/></p><p>\u201cWould you like to join me out on the balcony?\u201d Asked Bran, making your eyes widen and your eyebrows raise.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d You asked, not sure that you heard him right.<br/></p><p>\u201cI would like to look out over the sea from the balcony, and I wanted to know if you would accompany me.\u201d If you weren\u2019t mistaken, you could have sworn that you saw a hint of a smile playing on his lips.<br/></p><p>\u201cI would love to, your Majesty.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said Bran as you followed him towards the door.\u00a0\u201cIf I am to call you Y/N, then you can just call me Bran.\u201d You blushed, thankful that he was in front of you and couldn\u2019t see it.<br/></p><p>The two of you made your way to the privacy of the balcony, Bran closing the door behind you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI appreciate everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d you said,\u00a0\u201c I really do. But I have to ask, why\u00a0did you help me?\u201d<br/></p><p>Bran looked at you with an expression that almost looked cocky, playful.</p><p>\u201cCan I not come to the aid of a beautiful woman?\u201d He said, making your cheeks take on a pink hue. Noticing that you weren\u2019t going to take that as a final answer, he continued.\u00a0\u201cHave you ever heard of Greensight?\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Doesn\u2019t it mean having the ability to read minds or something?\u201d You felt a bit of panic rise in you at the thought that he might have it.

I hope you enjoyed! Also since it is set in Dorne, I would like to remind you that when I use the word\u00a0\u201cPrince\u201d I am referring to the Lord/Lady of Dorne. In Westerosi history, since the Dornish kingdom had a different history with joining the rest of Westeros, they were allowed to keep the title of Prince instead of calling themselves Lords. It is not speaking in terms of lineage to the Westerosi throne. Okay, nerdy lesson over!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"433\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/38ed7ee5ccbfb79b7e993ecd6bc21d22/tumblr_inline_pszxm5N6uO1usoepp_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"433\"></figure><p>Finally, all the wars were over. The Night King was dead, and so was Cersei Lannister. In Dorne, your new Prince had been put in place and things were seeming to shape up nicely. After years of fear, fighting, and uprisings, you finally felt safe.</p><p>As the lands of Westeros were becoming safe once again, your new King announced that he would be touring all of the six kingdoms as well as the North. Despite the past problems between the throne and the southern kingdom of Dorne, you were anxious to meet the new King. He came from house Stark, an honorable house which you had never had a problem with. He had only been king less than a year, but you were sure that he had already done a better job than Cersei. You hated that dreadful woman. You blamed her for the death of Prince Oberyn Martell, and consequently the rebellion that erupted from the sand snakes that led to the murder of the rest of your governing family.</p><p>You brushed thoughts of her from your mind, focusing instead on the matter at hand. King Brandon Stark would be at the castle by late tomorrow morning. As a hired hand in Sunspear\u2019s Old Palace this meant plenty of work for you, from sweeping the floors to making sure that every flower arrangement was situated perfectly. You were hosting a king after all; everything had to be absolutely perfect.</p><p>You rushed around the palace like a madwoman, furiously cleaning everything until it gleamed and shined. You worked until you thought your limbs might give out, working tirelessly until sundown when you were finally able to return to your quarters.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d called an elderly voice, making you turn to find the source.<br></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You called out, your voice echoing in the empty hallway. An older woman stepped out of the shadows, one that you knew quite well. She was the head of all the other maids, having worked in the palace for most of her life. When you were a scared young girl in need of work, she was the one who had taken you under her wing. She secured you a job in the castle, and helped you hold onto it as power switched hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNan!\u201d You smiled, rushing over to give the woman a hug. She returned the hug, holding you tightly as she smiled fondly at the nickname you and the other girls had given her.<br></p><p>\u201cHello my dear,\u201d she greeted you as you pulled away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever,\u201d you said,\u00a0\u201cthanks to these long hours preparing for King Brandon, I presume.\u201d She sighed.<br></p><p>\u201cYes my dear, it doesn\u2019t help that we always end up cleaning opposite ends of the castle,\u201d she said with her warm smile that made you feel at home.\u00a0\u201cBut I had to see you before the feast tomorrow.\u201d Your face fell.</p><p>\u201cAbout the feast,\u201d you revealed,\u00a0\u201cI do not plan on attending.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Screeched Nan, making you jump as the usually quiet woman raised her voice at you.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean you aren\u2019t going? The Prince has even excused you from going as a server!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, but-\u201d You started, but Nan cut you off.<br></p><p>\u201cNo buts! You get to attend this feast as a single woman, and an attractive one at that. I am not letting you wiggle your way out of this.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d fit in there,\u201d you admitted.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not so sure that I belong in the same room as a King and all the richest people in Dorne. I don\u2019t even have anything to wear.\u201d You gestured to the rags you wore, but as you turned back to Nan\u2019s eyes she was smiling knowingly.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called out to you Y/N, I think I may have something that could help.\u201d<br></p><p>You followed Nan to her chambers which were thankfully rather close to your own so you did not stray too far out of your way. There was a fire lit in the fireplace, illuminating the room in a soft, warm glow. You looked to the bed to only to find the most gorgeous dress that you had ever seen. You couldn\u2019t help the gasp that came from your mouth.</p><p>\u201cNan,\u201d you whispered.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is the dress I was wearing when I first met my dear late husband. At a feast not unlike this one, might I add.\u201d Nan reminisced with a smile.\u00a0\u201cIf you would accept, I would like you to wear it tomorrow evening.\u201d You spun to face her, shocked.<br></p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou are a beautiful girl Y/N, and you deserve a beautiful dress for such an occasion. You only meet the King once, after all. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to look stunning in front of Dorne\u2019s wealthy when you are of marrying age.\u201d<br></p><p>You blushed at Nan\u2019s words, but you had to admit that you were excited at the prospect. The gown was absolutely perfect. It was covered in swirling patterns that captured the eye, the background fabric your favorite color. You knew that it would look just as nice on you as Nan promised. And she was right, after all. You were of marrying age. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to get dressed up for potential suitors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear it,\u201d you agreed as Nan clasped her hands together excitedly before pushing the dress into your arms.<br></p><p>\u201cGood luck then dearie,\u201d she called,\u00a0\u201cseduce you a good one!\u201d<br></p><p>You blushed at her forward words, gathering the dress in your arms before making your way to your own room. You had been dreading tomorrow night, deciding to keep to yourself in your room all night. Now, you couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>The next morning you woke up in a good mood. The sun streamed in through your window ad the birds chirped, making you feel as if you were living a fantasy. You took your time getting ready, preparing yourself for the King\u2019s arrival. Once you were satisfied with your hair and outfit, you made your way down to where the rest of the palace was lining up. You had thought about wearing your new dress, but decided to save it for this evening alone.</p><p>As the carriages passed, you craned your neck to see a glimpse of the royal party but to no avail. Anybody of any real importance seemed to all have their windows darkened or their curtains drawn shut. All except for Bran, that was. As he passed you could see him clearly. His eyes locked onto yours, and you felt a smile come to your face. He gave you a small smile back as he carriage proceeded towards the castle. Although it was only for a moment, something about the way he looked at you took your breath away.</p><p>You shook the feeling, not allowing yourself to think about Bran that way. He was the King, and you were a lowly servant girl in Dorne. He just happened to meet your eyes was all, as he surely did to countless people trying to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p>You eagerly awaited the start of the feast, changing into the dress that Nan had given you. It looked even more beautiful on you. It hugged your body in the right places, but it was still modest. You weren\u2019t <i>that</i>\u00a0desperate. When it was finally time you strolled through the hallways towards the banquet room with a smile, trying to forget how you hoped to see the King again. See his soft brown eyes, his dark hair that you just wanted to run your hands through.</p><p>After you entered, you wandered aimlessly. You never went to these kinds of parties; the only times you did were as a server or a maid. This meant that you knew nobody, and the longer you were there, the more you wanted to leave. This had been your fear, and it was coming true.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood evening Gorgeous,\u201d came a deep voice from your left. You turned to face the Lord, smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d you replied.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met you before,\u201d he flirted, handing you a glass of wine.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy name is Y/N L/N,\u201d you told him as you took a sip of the drink.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, your name is just as beautiful as you are.\u201d Your cheeks dusted crimson, smiling at him. He told you his name as well, revealing to you that he had made quite a fortune in buying and selling ships. If he was trying to impress you, it sure was working.</p><p>You talked to the man for what felt like an hour, but it surely couldn\u2019t have been that long. You stopped drinking after your second glass, always drinking slowly to avoid becoming too intoxicated. This man did not do the same, drinking glass after glass as if it were just water. He quickly became drunk, becoming much more handsy as he drank more. At first it was tolerable, a light touch on the arm. However, he continued to drink and he continued to become more inappropriate. His hands would wander to your waist, and when he asked you to dance his hands would wander lower as you swayed. You kept moving his hands back up, but every time they strayed lower again and again. Agitated, you tried to excuse yourself from the conversation.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yelled the man in a drunken rage.\u00a0\u201cAm I not good enough for you?\u201d You froze as others turned to look at you.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m just going to go grab some-\u201d You said, trying to lie before you were interrupted by the drunk Lord.<br></p><p>\u201cYou damn whore! You can\u2019t lie to save your life.\u201d He started stalking towards you as you backed up in fear.\u00a0\u201cCome back here, you cunt!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse me, my Lord,\u201d came a voice from behind you. You were startled, jumping aside wide-eyed. Even more startling to you was that as you turned towards the voice, you saw King Brandon Stark looking towards the Lord who had been causing you trouble.\u00a0\u201cIs there an issue over here?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d spat the Lord.\u00a0\u201cThis dumb cunt has been leading me on all night, and now she thinks that she can just walk away from me.\u201d<br></p><p>You looked towards King Bran with wide, scared eyes, too afraid to tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d said the King. The Lord smirked, thinking that he had gotten his way. The smirk was quickly wiped from his face as the King continued,\u00a0\u201cyou are excused from the feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yelled the Lord in shock.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you just tell me? You can\u2019t say that!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAs King, I believe that I am allowed to say that. At my own feast, no less.\u201d As the man looked ready to argue more, King Bran continued calmly.\u00a0\u201cGuards,\u201d he said. You always expected people to yell for their guards, but he asked for them the same way you would expect him to greet anyone. They quickly came to his aid, whisking the other man away.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright, my Lady?\u201d Asked the King as he turned his full attention to you.<br></p><p>\u201cI think I am now. Thank you, your Majesty,\u201d you said with a curtsy.\u00a0\u201cBut I am no Lady.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen who are you?\u201d Asked the King. You were just shocked that he was still talking to you.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N L/N, I\u2019m just a servant who was allowed to attend as a guest,\u201d you said, embarrassed.<br></p><p>\u201cWould you like to join me out on the balcony?\u201d Asked Bran, making your eyes widen and your eyebrows raise.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d You asked, not sure that you heard him right.<br></p><p>\u201cI would like to look out over the sea from the balcony, and I wanted to know if you would accompany me.\u201d If you weren\u2019t mistaken, you could have sworn that you saw a hint of a smile playing on his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cI would love to, your Majesty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said Bran as you followed him towards the door.\u00a0\u201cIf I am to call you Y/N, then you can just call me Bran.\u201d You blushed, thankful that he was in front of you and couldn\u2019t see it.<br></p><p>The two of you made your way to the privacy of the balcony, Bran closing the door behind you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI appreciate everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d you said,\u00a0\u201c I really do. But I have to ask, why\u00a0did you help me?\u201d<br></p><p>Bran looked at you with an expression that almost looked cocky, playful.</p><p>\u201cCan I not come to the aid of a beautiful woman?\u201d He said, making your cheeks take on a pink hue. Noticing that you weren\u2019t going to take that as a final answer, he continued.\u00a0\u201cHave you ever heard of Greensight?\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Doesn\u2019t it mean having the ability to read minds or something?\u201d You felt a bit of panic rise in you at the thought that he might have it. You really didn\u2019t want him hearing all the thoughts you\u2019ve been having about him. Especially about how much you liked the way he looked.<br></p><p>Bran chuckled at your words.</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt means that a Greenseer can see into the past, and sometimes future, or anybody they would like. I am asking because I have it.\u201d You cocked your head in confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you are helping me.\u201d You froze.\u00a0\u201cDo I die soon or something and you pity me?\u201d<br></p><p>Bran laughed at your words, and you could\u2019t help but giggle back. He normally seemed so calm and serious, but seeing him laugh carefree made him look even more attractive to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I guess that\u2019s not it,\u201d you smile.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, not quite,\u201d replied Bran as he returned your smile.\u00a0\u201cYou see, the thing is that I can\u2019t see anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You sputtered, shocked.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything in your past, nor your future. It is as if there is a wall put up between us, blocking any information. I have to admit, it\u2019s rather intriguing. You\u2019re an enigma.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d You said, cocking your head. Bran smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cAn enigma.

The Night King was dead, and so was Cersei Lannister. In Dorne, your new Prince had been put in place and things were seeming to shape up nicely. After years of fear, fighting, and uprisings, you finally felt safe.</p><p>As the lands of Westeros were becoming safe once again, your new King announced that he would be touring all of the six kingdoms as well as the North. Despite the past problems between the throne and the southern kingdom of Dorne, you were anxious to meet the new King. He came from house Stark, an honorable house which you had never had a problem with. He had only been king less than a year, but you were sure that he had already done a better job than Cersei. You hated that dreadful woman. You blamed her for the death of Prince Oberyn Martell, and consequently the rebellion that erupted from the sand snakes that led to the murder of the rest of your governing family.</p><p>You brushed thoughts of her from your mind, focusing instead on the matter at hand. King Brandon Stark would be at the castle by late tomorrow morning. As a hired hand in Sunspear\u2019s Old Palace this meant plenty of work for you, from sweeping the floors to making sure that every flower arrangement was situated perfectly. You were hosting a king after all; everything had to be absolutely perfect.</p><p>You rushed around the palace like a madwoman, furiously cleaning everything until it gleamed and shined. You worked until you thought your limbs might give out, working tirelessly until sundown when you were finally able to return to your quarters.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d called an elderly voice, making you turn to find the source.<br></p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d You called out, your voice echoing in the empty hallway. An older woman stepped out of the shadows, one that you knew quite well. She was the head of all the other maids, having worked in the palace for most of her life. When you were a scared young girl in need of work, she was the one who had taken you under her wing. She secured you a job in the castle, and helped you hold onto it as power switched hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNan!\u201d You smiled, rushing over to give the woman a hug. She returned the hug, holding you tightly as she smiled fondly at the nickname you and the other girls had given her.<br></p><p>\u201cHello my dear,\u201d she greeted you as you pulled away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever,\u201d you said,\u00a0\u201cthanks to these long hours preparing for King Brandon, I presume.\u201d She sighed.<br></p><p>\u201cYes my dear, it doesn\u2019t help that we always end up cleaning opposite ends of the castle,\u201d she said with her warm smile that made you feel at home.\u00a0\u201cBut I had to see you before the feast tomorrow.\u201d Your face fell.</p><p>\u201cAbout the feast,\u201d you revealed,\u00a0\u201cI do not plan on attending.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Screeched Nan, making you jump as the usually quiet woman raised her voice at you.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean you aren\u2019t going? The Prince has even excused you from going as a server!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, but-\u201d You started, but Nan cut you off.<br></p><p>\u201cNo buts! You get to attend this feast as a single woman, and an attractive one at that. I am not letting you wiggle your way out of this.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d fit in there,\u201d you admitted.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not so sure that I belong in the same room as a King and all the richest people in Dorne. I don\u2019t even have anything to wear.\u201d You gestured to the rags you wore, but as you turned back to Nan\u2019s eyes she was smiling knowingly.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called out to you Y/N, I think I may have something that could help.\u201d<br></p><p>You followed Nan to her chambers which were thankfully rather close to your own so you did not stray too far out of your way. There was a fire lit in the fireplace, illuminating the room in a soft, warm glow. You looked to the bed to only to find the most gorgeous dress that you had ever seen. You couldn\u2019t help the gasp that came from your mouth.</p><p>\u201cNan,\u201d you whispered.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis is the dress I was wearing when I first met my dear late husband. At a feast not unlike this one, might I add.\u201d Nan reminisced with a smile.\u00a0\u201cIf you would accept, I would like you to wear it tomorrow evening.\u201d You spun to face her, shocked.<br></p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou are a beautiful girl Y/N, and you deserve a beautiful dress for such an occasion. You only meet the King once, after all. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to look stunning in front of Dorne\u2019s wealthy when you are of marrying age.\u201d<br></p><p>You blushed at Nan\u2019s words, but you had to admit that you were excited at the prospect. The gown was absolutely perfect. It was covered in swirling patterns that captured the eye, the background fabric your favorite color. You knew that it would look just as nice on you as Nan promised. And she was right, after all. You were of marrying age. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to get dressed up for potential suitors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear it,\u201d you agreed as Nan clasped her hands together excitedly before pushing the dress into your arms.<br></p><p>\u201cGood luck then dearie,\u201d she called,\u00a0\u201cseduce you a good one!\u201d<br></p><p>You blushed at her forward words, gathering the dress in your arms before making your way to your own room. You had been dreading tomorrow night, deciding to keep to yourself in your room all night. Now, you couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>The next morning you woke up in a good mood. The sun streamed in through your window ad the birds chirped, making you feel as if you were living a fantasy. You took your time getting ready, preparing yourself for the King\u2019s arrival. Once you were satisfied with your hair and outfit, you made your way down to where the rest of the palace was lining up. You had thought about wearing your new dress, but decided to save it for this evening alone.</p><p>As the carriages passed, you craned your neck to see a glimpse of the royal party but to no avail. Anybody of any real importance seemed to all have their windows darkened or their curtains drawn shut. All except for Bran, that was. As he passed you could see him clearly. His eyes locked onto yours, and you felt a smile come to your face. He gave you a small smile back as he carriage proceeded towards the castle. Although it was only for a moment, something about the way he looked at you took your breath away.</p><p>You shook the feeling, not allowing yourself to think about Bran that way. He was the King, and you were a lowly servant girl in Dorne. He just happened to meet your eyes was all, as he surely did to countless people trying to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p>You eagerly awaited the start of the feast, changing into the dress that Nan had given you. It looked even more beautiful on you. It hugged your body in the right places, but it was still modest. You weren\u2019t <i>that</i>\u00a0desperate. When it was finally time you strolled through the hallways towards the banquet room with a smile, trying to forget how you hoped to see the King again. See his soft brown eyes, his dark hair that you just wanted to run your hands through.</p><p>After you entered, you wandered aimlessly. You never went to these kinds of parties; the only times you did were as a server or a maid. This meant that you knew nobody, and the longer you were there, the more you wanted to leave. This had been your fear, and it was coming true.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood evening Gorgeous,\u201d came a deep voice from your left. You turned to face the Lord, smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d you replied.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met you before,\u201d he flirted, handing you a glass of wine.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy name is Y/N L/N,\u201d you told him as you took a sip of the drink.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, your name is just as beautiful as you are.\u201d Your cheeks dusted crimson, smiling at him. He told you his name as well, revealing to you that he had made quite a fortune in buying and selling ships. If he was trying to impress you, it sure was working.</p><p>You talked to the man for what felt like an hour, but it surely couldn\u2019t have been that long. You stopped drinking after your second glass, always drinking slowly to avoid becoming too intoxicated. This man did not do the same, drinking glass after glass as if it were just water. He quickly became drunk, becoming much more handsy as he drank more. At first it was tolerable, a light touch on the arm. However, he continued to drink and he continued to become more inappropriate. His hands would wander to your waist, and when he asked you to dance his hands would wander lower as you swayed. You kept moving his hands back up, but every time they strayed lower again and again. Agitated, you tried to excuse yourself from the conversation.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yelled the man in a drunken rage.\u00a0\u201cAm I not good enough for you?\u201d You froze as others turned to look at you.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m just going to go grab some-\u201d You said, trying to lie before you were interrupted by the drunk Lord.<br></p><p>\u201cYou damn whore! You can\u2019t lie to save your life.\u201d He started stalking towards you as you backed up in fear.\u00a0\u201cCome back here, you cunt!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cExcuse me, my Lord,\u201d came a voice from behind you. You were startled, jumping aside wide-eyed. Even more startling to you was that as you turned towards the voice, you saw King Brandon Stark looking towards the Lord who had been causing you trouble.\u00a0\u201cIs there an issue over here?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d spat the Lord.\u00a0\u201cThis dumb cunt has been leading me on all night, and now she thinks that she can just walk away from me.\u201d<br></p><p>You looked towards King Bran with wide, scared eyes, too afraid to tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d said the King. The Lord smirked, thinking that he had gotten his way. The smirk was quickly wiped from his face as the King continued,\u00a0\u201cyou are excused from the feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yelled the Lord in shock.\u00a0\u201cWhat did you just tell me? You can\u2019t say that!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAs King, I believe that I am allowed to say that. At my own feast, no less.\u201d As the man looked ready to argue more, King Bran continued calmly.\u00a0\u201cGuards,\u201d he said. You always expected people to yell for their guards, but he asked for them the same way you would expect him to greet anyone. They quickly came to his aid, whisking the other man away.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright, my Lady?\u201d Asked the King as he turned his full attention to you.<br></p><p>\u201cI think I am now. Thank you, your Majesty,\u201d you said with a curtsy.\u00a0\u201cBut I am no Lady.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen who are you?\u201d Asked the King. You were just shocked that he was still talking to you.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N L/N, I\u2019m just a servant who was allowed to attend as a guest,\u201d you said, embarrassed.<br></p><p>\u201cWould you like to join me out on the balcony?\u201d Asked Bran, making your eyes widen and your eyebrows raise.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d You asked, not sure that you heard him right.<br></p><p>\u201cI would like to look out over the sea from the balcony, and I wanted to know if you would accompany me.\u201d If you weren\u2019t mistaken, you could have sworn that you saw a hint of a smile playing on his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cI would love to, your Majesty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said Bran as you followed him towards the door.\u00a0\u201cIf I am to call you Y/N, then you can just call me Bran.\u201d You blushed, thankful that he was in front of you and couldn\u2019t see it.<br></p><p>The two of you made your way to the privacy of the balcony, Bran closing the door behind you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI appreciate everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d you said,\u00a0\u201c I really do. But I have to ask, why\u00a0did you help me?\u201d<br></p><p>Bran looked at you with an expression that almost looked cocky, playful.</p><p>\u201cCan I not come to the aid of a beautiful woman?\u201d He said, making your cheeks take on a pink hue. Noticing that you weren\u2019t going to take that as a final answer, he continued.\u00a0\u201cHave you ever heard of Greensight?\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Doesn\u2019t it mean having the ability to read minds or something?\u201d You felt a bit of panic rise in you at the thought that he might have it. You really didn\u2019t want him hearing all the thoughts you\u2019ve been having about him. Especially about how much you liked the way he looked.<br></p><p>Bran chuckled at your words.</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt means that a Greenseer can see into the past, and sometimes future, or anybody they would like. I am asking because I have it.\u201d You cocked your head in confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you are helping me.\u201d You froze.\u00a0\u201cDo I die soon or something and you pity me?\u201d<br></p><p>Bran laughed at your words, and you could\u2019t help but giggle back. He normally seemed so calm and serious, but seeing him laugh carefree made him look even more attractive to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo I guess that\u2019s not it,\u201d you smile.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, not quite,\u201d replied Bran as he returned your smile.\u00a0\u201cYou see, the thing is that I can\u2019t see anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You sputtered, shocked.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything in your past, nor your future. It is as if there is a wall put up between us, blocking any information. I have to admit, it\u2019s rather intriguing. You\u2019re an enigma.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d You said, cocking your head. Bran smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cAn enigma. You\u2019re like a puzzle.\u201d You blushed as Bran continued to look at you with his beautiful brown eyes.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to figure you out.\u201d Now you were definitely blushing.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked him shyly.<br></p><p>\u201cI want you to come back to King\u2019s Landing with me,\u201d he revealed and your jaw dropped.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to spend more time with you. I\u2019ve never met somebody that I couldn\u2019t read.\u201d<br></p><p>Despite the suddenness of the situation, it somehow felt right. You felt something drawing you to Bran, and not just because he was King. Something made you want to be with him, stay near him.</p><p>\u201cI will return with you,\u201d you agreed.\u00a0\u201cBut on one condition.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnything, Darling.\u201d You had to push down the giddiness in your body at the nickname he used for you before continuing.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cleaning the Red Keep.\u201d<br></p><p>Bran laughed again.</p><p>\u201cY/N, my dear, I think you\u2019ve got the wrong idea. You\u2019re returning as my guest.\u201d You blushed harder and harder every time Bran spoke.\u00a0\u201cMy enigma.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI have to warn you though,\u201d you stated,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t do well on the water.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAt least you don\u2019t roll back and forth with the waves.\u201d<br></p><p>You burst out into laughter at Bran\u2019s words, picturing his chair rolling back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you muttered between fits of giggles.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t mean to laugh at you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt was a joke Y/N, you\u2019re supposed to laugh.\u201d He responded warmly. You could get used to banter like this.<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>A/N: </b>I really enjoyed writing this.

The gown was absolutely perfect. It was covered in swirling patterns that captured the eye, the background fabric your favorite color. You knew that it would look just as nice on you as Nan promised. And she was right, after all. You were of marrying age. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to get dressed up for potential suitors.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear it,&rdquo; you agreed as Nan clasped her hands together excitedly before pushing the dress into your arms.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good luck then dearie,&rdquo; she called,&nbsp;&ldquo;seduce you a good one!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You blushed at her forward words, gathering the dress in your arms before making your way to your own room. You had been dreading tomorrow night, deciding to keep to yourself in your room all night. Now, you couldn&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>The next morning you woke up in a good mood. The sun streamed in through your window ad the birds chirped, making you feel as if you were living a fantasy. You took your time getting ready, preparing yourself for the King&rsquo;s arrival. Once you were satisfied with your hair and outfit, you made your way down to where the rest of the palace was lining up. You had thought about wearing your new dress, but decided to save it for this evening alone.</p><p>As the carriages passed, you craned your neck to see a glimpse of the royal party but to no avail. Anybody of any real importance seemed to all have their windows darkened or their curtains drawn shut. All except for Bran, that was. As he passed you could see him clearly. His eyes locked onto yours, and you felt a smile come to your face. He gave you a small smile back as he carriage proceeded towards the castle. Although it was only for a moment, something about the way he looked at you took your breath away.</p><p>You shook the feeling, not allowing yourself to think about Bran that way. He was the King, and you were a lowly servant girl in Dorne. He just happened to meet your eyes was all, as he surely did to countless people trying to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p>You eagerly awaited the start of the feast, changing into the dress that Nan had given you. It looked even more beautiful on you. It hugged your body in the right places, but it was still modest. You weren&rsquo;t <i>that</i>&nbsp;desperate. When it was finally time you strolled through the hallways towards the banquet room with a smile, trying to forget how you hoped to see the King again. See his soft brown eyes, his dark hair that you just wanted to run your hands through.</p><p>After you entered, you wandered aimlessly. You never went to these kinds of parties; the only times you did were as a server or a maid. This meant that you knew nobody, and the longer you were there, the more you wanted to leave. This had been your fear, and it was coming true.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening Gorgeous,&rdquo; came a deep voice from your left. You turned to face the Lord, smiling brightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; you replied.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve met you before,&rdquo; he flirted, handing you a glass of wine.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My name is Y/N L/N,&rdquo; you told him as you took a sip of the drink.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, your name is just as beautiful as you are.&rdquo; Your cheeks dusted crimson, smiling at him. He told you his name as well, revealing to you that he had made quite a fortune in buying and selling ships. If he was trying to impress you, it sure was working.</p><p>You talked to the man for what felt like an hour, but it surely couldn&rsquo;t have been that long. You stopped drinking after your second glass, always drinking slowly to avoid becoming too intoxicated. This man did not do the same, drinking glass after glass as if it were just water. He quickly became drunk, becoming much more handsy as he drank more. At first it was tolerable, a light touch on the arm. However, he continued to drink and he continued to become more inappropriate. His hands would wander to your waist, and when he asked you to dance his hands would wander lower as you swayed. You kept moving his hands back up, but every time they strayed lower again and again. Agitated, you tried to excuse yourself from the conversation.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Yelled the man in a drunken rage.&nbsp;&ldquo;Am I not good enough for you?&rdquo; You froze as others turned to look at you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the case. I&rsquo;m just going to go grab some-&rdquo; You said, trying to lie before you were interrupted by the drunk Lord.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You damn whore! You can&rsquo;t lie to save your life.&rdquo; He started stalking towards you as you backed up in fear.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come back here, you cunt!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, my Lord,&rdquo; came a voice from behind you. You were startled, jumping aside wide-eyed. Even more startling to you was that as you turned towards the voice, you saw King Brandon Stark looking towards the Lord who had been causing you trouble.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there an issue over here?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spat the Lord.&nbsp;&ldquo;This dumb cunt has been leading me on all night, and now she thinks that she can just walk away from me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You looked towards King Bran with wide, scared eyes, too afraid to tell him the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the King. The Lord smirked, thinking that he had gotten his way. The smirk was quickly wiped from his face as the King continued,&nbsp;&ldquo;you are excused from the feast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Yelled the Lord in shock.&nbsp;&ldquo;What did you just tell me? You can&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;As King, I believe that I am allowed to say that. At my own feast, no less.&rdquo; As the man looked ready to argue more, King Bran continued calmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Guards,&rdquo; he said. You always expected people to yell for their guards, but he asked for them the same way you would expect him to greet anyone. They quickly came to his aid, whisking the other man away.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright, my Lady?&rdquo; Asked the King as he turned his full attention to you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think I am now. Thank you, your Majesty,&rdquo; you said with a curtsy.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I am no Lady.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then who are you?&rdquo; Asked the King. You were just shocked that he was still talking to you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N L/N, I&rsquo;m just a servant who was allowed to attend as a guest,&rdquo; you said, embarrassed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to join me out on the balcony?&rdquo; Asked Bran, making your eyes widen and your eyebrows raise.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo; You asked, not sure that you heard him right.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I would like to look out over the sea from the balcony, and I wanted to know if you would accompany me.&rdquo; If you weren&rsquo;t mistaken, you could have sworn that you saw a hint of a smile playing on his lips.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I would love to, your Majesty.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; said Bran as you followed him towards the door.&nbsp;&ldquo;If I am to call you Y/N, then you can just call me Bran.&rdquo; You blushed, thankful that he was in front of you and couldn&rsquo;t see it.<br /></p><p>The two of you made your way to the privacy of the balcony, Bran closing the door behind you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I appreciate everything you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; you said,&nbsp;&ldquo; I really do. But I have to ask, why&nbsp;did you help me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bran looked at you with an expression that almost looked cocky, playful.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I not come to the aid of a beautiful woman?&rdquo; He said, making your cheeks take on a pink hue. Noticing that you weren&rsquo;t going to take that as a final answer, he continued.&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you ever heard of Greensight?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? Doesn&rsquo;t it mean having the ability to read minds or something?&rdquo; You felt a bit of panic rise in you at the thought that he might have it. You really didn&rsquo;t want him hearing all the thoughts you&rsquo;ve been having about him. Especially about how much you liked the way he looked.<br /></p><p>Bran chuckled at your words.</p><p>&ldquo;Close,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It means that a Greenseer can see into the past, and sometimes future, or anybody they would like. I am asking because I have it.&rdquo; You cocked your head in confusion.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand why you are helping me.&rdquo; You froze.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do I die soon or something and you pity me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bran laughed at your words, and you could&rsquo;t help but giggle back. He normally seemed so calm and serious, but seeing him laugh carefree made him look even more attractive to you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So I guess that&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; you smile.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, not quite,&rdquo; replied Bran as he returned your smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;You see, the thing is that I can&rsquo;t see anything for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You sputtered, shocked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything in your past, nor your future. It is as if there is a wall put up between us, blocking any information. I have to admit, it&rsquo;s rather intriguing. You&rsquo;re an enigma.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a what?&rdquo; You said, cocking your head. Bran smiled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;An enigma. You&rsquo;re like a puzzle.&rdquo; You blushed as Bran continued to look at you with his beautiful brown eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to figure you out.&rdquo; Now you were definitely blushing.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; You asked him shyly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I want you to come back to King&rsquo;s Landing with me,&rdquo; he revealed and your jaw dropped.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to spend more time with you. I&rsquo;ve never met somebody that I couldn&rsquo;t read.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Despite the suddenness of the situation, it somehow felt right. You felt something drawing you to Bran, and not just because he was King. Something made you want to be with him, stay near him.</p><p>&ldquo;I will return with you,&rdquo; you agreed.&nbsp;&ldquo;But on one condition.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anything, Darling.&rdquo; You had to push down the giddiness in your body at the nickname he used for you before continuing.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not cleaning the Red Keep.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bran laughed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, my dear, I think you&rsquo;ve got the wrong idea. You&rsquo;re returning as my guest.&rdquo; You blushed harder and harder every time Bran spoke.&nbsp;&ldquo;My enigma.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have to warn you though,&rdquo; you stated,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do well on the water.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;At least you don&rsquo;t roll back and forth with the waves.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You burst out into laughter at Bran&rsquo;s words, picturing his chair rolling back and forth.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you muttered between fits of giggles.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to laugh at you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was a joke Y/N, you&rsquo;re supposed to laugh.&rdquo; He responded warmly. You could get used to banter like this.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>A/N: </b>I really enjoyed writing this. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write a part 2 sometime, as I guess I didn&rsquo;t <i>completely</i>&nbsp;flesh out the request. I would like to pick up with them in the Red Keep sometime!

Not everyday someone\ninvites you to travel with your goddamn mind, of course you were nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\njust\u2026 what if I get lost?\u201d Yes, it was kind of exaggerated thinking\nthat, mostly because Bran was experienced in this whole thing but it was just\nso much pressure at the moment and him getting exasperated wasn\u2019t helping at\nall. </p><p>\u201cFor the\nOld Gods, Y/N, you won\u2019t get lost, you know it. Come on, it\u2019ll be fun&quot; he\nwas totally annoyed now, taping the table beside him and looking at you\nintently.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nthen. Let\u2019s do it\u201d you took his hand and he smirked not giving you the\ntime to question him why the cocky expression he made. </p><p>Right when\nyou touched his hand, numbness ran through your body for a few seconds. It felt\nlike being half sleep for a few moments and then abruptly waking up. </p><p>When you\ndid, the first you noticed was the hot breeze hitting your face; looking around\nyou could tell it was King\u2019s Landing but way long before. The Iron Throne was\nstanding in all its glory in front of you, going back in time you\u2019d never\nthought you would be able to see it, and after the recent events it was a long\nlost wish. But there it was: prominent. </p><p>\u201cSo,\nwhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Turning\naround you saw Bran staring back at you. It took you a few seconds to realize\nit was really happening; he was standing on his own and looked so good and so\ntall. You just simply couldn\u2019t get the words out of your mouth, looking straight\nto his eyes he gave you a little smile and walked closer to you, stopping\nbarely a few inches away. </p><p>\u201cCat got\nyour tongue? I asked you something, Y/N\u201d you didn\u2019t realize you were biting\nyour lower lip until you noticed Bran staring attentively at it.</p><p>\u201cI think is\nbetter when I get to be the tall one.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and\nwalked past you walking in the direction to the Iron Throne, once he was in\nfront of it he turned around and you were able to catch the lust filled expression\nhis eyes were carrying. When he finally sat on it you let out a breath, he looked\nso good sitting on it. And he was all yours.</p><p>\u201cCome here\u201d\nhe commanded.</p><p>You started\nwalking in his direction already feeling aroused; you heart beating fast every time\nyou got closer. He reached for your hand, you were standing between his legs now\nlooking down at him. Bran grabbed your face carefully leading your lips to his.\nIt wasn\u2019t a soft or delicate kiss, both of you were fighting for dominance, you bit his\nlip and Bran let out a throaty moan that was music for your ears. </p><p>You were\nundoing his pants while letting a trail of kisses from his mouth to his crotch, stopping by\nhis neck to giving it little bites and suck on his sweet spot, his groans\nmotivating you to keep going; he helped you to get rid of his leather top and\nyou kissed all the way down his chest while he stared back at you. <i>Fuck</i>, you thought; you would be lying if\nyou said you never fantasized of sucking him while he was sitting on the throne.</p><p>He grabbed\nyour face once more and kissed you roughly biting your lip. You moaned against\nhis mouth.</p><p>Your hands\nfound his length, fingers wrapping around him and pumping his shaft repeatedly,\nhe was rock hard and you could feel your arousal growing every second. \u00a0Looking up at him you licked it all the way\nfrom its base to the tip, sucking it slowly while you pumped what didn\u2019t fit in\nyour mouth, the strangled sounds he let out only turned you on more.</p><p>\u201cFucking\nhell, Y/N\u201d he said while grabbing a fistful of your hair. \u00a0</p><p>It only\nencouraged you to suck faster and faster, Bran\u2019s moans and grunts were music\nfor your ears, you felt his cock twitching and you knew he was close, \u201c<i>fuck, fuck, fuck, don\u2019t stop</i>\u201d and you\ndid exactly the opposite, letting go of his length with a \u2018pop\u2019 sound.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\nfucking hell, Y/N?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d you\nsaid as innocently as you could. Bran\u2019s eyes were clouded with lust, getting up\nhe grabbed you roughly and sat you on the throne, it was cold and in contrast\nto your body the contact made you squirm in your place.</p><p>Once you were\nfully seated and as comfortable as you could Bran almost ripped your gown off\nof you, totally desperate to taste you, leaving you completely naked in front\nof him. He kissed you softly while his right hand traveled to your slit, slowly\ncaressing it and driving you insane. Bran left a trail of kisses all the way\ndown from your breasts to you tights.</p><p>\u201cBran\u2026\u201d you\nhissed.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\nlove?\u201d he asked looking up at you while he brushed his lips softly against your\ninner tights, \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you\nto do something, anything, please.\u201d You sounded so desperate but you didn\u2019t care,\nyou just needed him to touch you, to kiss you, to something.</p><p>He smiled\nand brought your hips down, working his tongue on your clit painfully slowly;\nyou gasped at the contact, you were already so sensitive, your knees wanting to\ngive out as he stopped. He licked his fingers and slowly dragged a finger down\nyour slit, sliding it inside you in and out, Bran let out a moan as he felt how\nswollen you were.\u00a0</p><p> \u201cOh f-fuck. Bran!\u201d you screamed. He started to\nfinger you faster while licking your clit. You were a squirming mess as you\ncould feel the not forming on your stomach, you were so close but just as you\nwere about to come Bran lifted you and turned you around, you having to lift a\nleg on the throne in order to be more comfortable.</p><p>Bran\nstarted to rub the tip of his dick on your entrance, both of you moaning at the\nfriction.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\nwhat do you want me to do to you, Y/N?\u201d he spoke in your ear, his voice so low\nit turned you on even more if it even was possible.</p><p>\u201cI want you\nto fuck me, Bran.\u201d </p><p>And with no\nwarning he slid himself inside of you, not moving for a while to let you get\nused to the feeling, he filled you up so good your legs trembled you felt as\nyou were about to fall if he wasn\u2019t holding. Already wanting more, you started\nto rock back and forth earning a guttural groan from Bran; he took the hint and\nproceeded to start moving, it was so slow at first, letting you feel every\ninch, he slid a hand in front of you and started masturbating you.</p><p>\u201cHar-harder.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cAs the\nQueen commands\u201d was all he said.</p><p>He started\nfucking you mercilessly while his fingers still worked on your clit, you felt\nlike your legs would give up at any minute, he was hitting the right spot you weren\u2019t\neven able to form words, all you could do was moan loudly. Bran\u2019s groan against\nyour ear as he slid himself in and out of you was all you needed to finally let\ngo. Your body squirmed between Bran\u2019s embrace and he held you still as you came\nundone.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\nlove, let go. I\u2019m coming too.\u201d He moaned.</p><p>You felt his\ncock twitching as he came inside of you filling you up. You groaned at the\nsensation, still sensitive. Once both of you controlled your breaths and came\ndown from your highs, he sat you on his lap, embracing you as he kissed your\nforehead lovingly. </p><p>\u201cSo, what\ndo you think now?\u201d he asked looking down at you.</p><p>\u201cI think we\nshould do it more often.\u201d He laughed and kissed your lips softly. Now you were\neager to share more of this mind travels with Bran, surely you weren\u2019t nervous\nno more.</p>",

There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn&rsquo;t know that, Bran was convinced.",
