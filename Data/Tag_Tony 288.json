Because I grew up pretty poor myself, I wanted to write my own version of how a stressful financial situation would turn out for Peter. So here we go&hellip;</b></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>It had been a long day for Peter Parker. Between his chemistry test, spilled lunch, and all the drunk guys he practically carried home in the rain during his evening patrol, he was wiped. When he carefully opened his bedroom window and quietly climbed into his room for the night, he immediately stripped off his suit and fell back onto his bed. There was nothing quite like the feeling of dropping like a dead weight onto a warm fluffy bed after a hard day.</p><p>The young teen would have fallen asleep as soon as his head hit his pillow if it weren&rsquo;t for his mutant senses, having been heightened to detect even the quietest whispers. Normally, the apartment was quiet at eleven at night because his Aunt May was in bed, cramming in a few hours of sleep before her pre-sunrise morning shift. But tonight, Peter could hear small sniffles coming from the other side of his door. He pulled himself out of his bed and crept to his door, pressing his ear close.</p><p>Yes, Aunt May was definitely crying.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart began to race. The last time he saw his aunt cry was at Uncle Ben&rsquo;s funeral. He used to think that the dead were the most broken of humanity. That is, until he had looked into the eyes of his freshly-widowed aunt. Peter didn&rsquo;t want to see her crying again, but the compulsion to comfort her outweighed the small feelings of dread within him. He threw on some sweatpants and a shirt and stepped out of his room.</p><p>The only light came from a small corner lamp in the living room, casting dark shadows everywhere but somehow managing to dimly illuminate May who was seated at the kitchen&rsquo;s small island. Papers were strewn about. Aunt May had her face in her hands.</p><p>Peter slowly stepped over to her. Softly, he called out, &ldquo;May?&rdquo;</p><p>She jerked her face out of her hands, exclaiming &ldquo;Peter! Your room was so quiet: I didn&rsquo;t know you were still awake!&rdquo; May avoided looking at Peter. She began picking up some of the papers, organizing them, shuffling them: anything to seem more in-control than she had looked seconds before.</p><p>Peter stepped up to the counter and recognized the papers: bills. The teen didn&rsquo;t know everything about the way that their rent worked, but he knew that if their utility fees surpassed the amount covered by rent, their landlord would charge them the difference. It seemed like a good plan, but their rent didn&rsquo;t cover much so they always ended up with bills to pay. These plus the extra costs of phone plans, internet, cable, food, Peter&rsquo;s school fees, occasional emergencies, and other necessities required tight monthly budgeting. Peter ventured, &ldquo;Is everything\u2026 okay?&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>Aunt May forced a short laugh, &ldquo;Of course, hun, everything&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Then, trying to change the subject, &ldquo;You should really be getting to bed. You have school tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should, too. What are you doing up so late?&rdquo; Peter didn&rsquo;t want to let up. He knew May liked to be strong in front of him, but he wanted to help if there was something wrong.</p><p>May sighed, looking like a deflated balloon as her posture slackened. &ldquo;Just, you know, sorting out some finances for the month.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How bad is it?&rdquo; Peter asked in a near whisper. The observant boy already partially knew the answer: it was always bad since Uncle Ben died. In fact, to make up for it, they had cut back on quite a few things in the house over the past few months. They no longer subscribed to Netflix or Hulu. In fact, they stopped TV altogether when they ended their cable contract. They also switched to a cheaper, shared data plan for their phones. The two also agreed that electronics be completely unplugged unless it was currently being used, that Peter arrive early to school to shower, and that laundry be done once every other week.</p><p>The shower situation really sucked, but Peter&rsquo;s least favorite cut-back was the food. May only bought enough food for breakfast and dinner, and Peter had to sign up for the free lunch program at school. Sometimes, when their cabinets looked truly empty, Aunt May would come home with a package of meat and a boxed starch, and Peter was sure that she had caved and stopped by a community soup kitchen on the way home. It had been really hard on him with his high metabolism, so lately Peter had been stopping at Ned&rsquo;s house on the way home from school for a snack. He felt guilty, but medical bills due to malnutrition were the last thing May should have to deal with.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not\u2012&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; Peter interjected.</p><p>May sighed again. Slowly, she turned her face to look at her nephew. She loved him so much. A kid shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about finances. But things were looking bleak, and he deserved to know. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ll have enough to pay the rent for next month.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>May, reading the panic in Peter&rsquo;s face, rushed to calm him. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry about it! I&rsquo;m already looking for another job\u2012&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You already have two,&rdquo; Peter noted. The teen was angry at himself for his inability to hide his emotions well. &ldquo;Let me get a job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; May said, rejecting the idea. &ldquo;You have school and the Stark internship. Those are too important for your future. Let me handle this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. Really. It was getting boring anyway. I&rsquo;m not really getting anywhere with it. Not sure if I even want to be an engineer anymore,&rdquo; Peter lied.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; She stood up, brushed a stray piece of hair out of her nephew&rsquo;s eyes, and cupped his face.</p><p>Her eyes looked so sad. Peter was grateful for the dim lighting, hiding the tears that were forming in his own eyes. He took her hand off of his face and gave it a reassuring squeeze. &ldquo;This is our best option,&rdquo; he spoke, forcing his voice to remain as steady as possible.</p><p>She looked away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;May.

So here we go\u2026</b></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>It had been a long day for Peter Parker. Between his chemistry test, spilled lunch, and all the drunk guys he practically carried home in the rain during his evening patrol, he was wiped. When he carefully opened his bedroom window and quietly climbed into his room for the night, he immediately stripped off his suit and fell back onto his bed. There was nothing quite like the feeling of dropping like a dead weight onto a warm fluffy bed after a hard day.</p><p>The young teen would have fallen asleep as soon as his head hit his pillow if it weren\u2019t for his mutant senses, having been heightened to detect even the quietest whispers. Normally, the apartment was quiet at eleven at night because his Aunt May was in bed, cramming in a few hours of sleep before her pre-sunrise morning shift. But tonight, Peter could hear small sniffles coming from the other side of his door. He pulled himself out of his bed and crept to his door, pressing his ear close.</p><p>Yes, Aunt May was definitely crying.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart began to race. The last time he saw his aunt cry was at Uncle Ben\u2019s funeral. He used to think that the dead were the most broken of humanity. That is, until he had looked into the eyes of his freshly-widowed aunt. Peter didn\u2019t want to see her crying again, but the compulsion to comfort her outweighed the small feelings of dread within him. He threw on some sweatpants and a shirt and stepped out of his room.</p><p>The only light came from a small corner lamp in the living room, casting dark shadows everywhere but somehow managing to dimly illuminate May who was seated at the kitchen\u2019s small island. Papers were strewn about. Aunt May had her face in her hands.</p><p>Peter slowly stepped over to her. Softly, he called out, \u201cMay?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her face out of her hands, exclaiming \u201cPeter! Your room was so quiet: I didn\u2019t know you were still awake!\u201d May avoided looking at Peter. She began picking up some of the papers, organizing them, shuffling them: anything to seem more in-control than she had looked seconds before.</p><p>Peter stepped up to the counter and recognized the papers: bills. The teen didn\u2019t know everything about the way that their rent worked, but he knew that if their utility fees surpassed the amount covered by rent, their landlord would charge them the difference. It seemed like a good plan, but their rent didn\u2019t cover much so they always ended up with bills to pay. These plus the extra costs of phone plans, internet, cable, food, Peter\u2019s school fees, occasional emergencies, and other necessities required tight monthly budgeting. Peter ventured, \u201cIs everything\u2026 okay?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Aunt May forced a short laugh, \u201cOf course, hun, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d Then, trying to change the subject, \u201cYou should really be getting to bed. You have school tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, too. What are you doing up so late?\u201d Peter didn\u2019t want to let up. He knew May liked to be strong in front of him, but he wanted to help if there was something wrong.</p><p>May sighed, looking like a deflated balloon as her posture slackened. \u201cJust, you know, sorting out some finances for the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Peter asked in a near whisper. The observant boy already partially knew the answer: it was always bad since Uncle Ben died. In fact, to make up for it, they had cut back on quite a few things in the house over the past few months. They no longer subscribed to Netflix or Hulu. In fact, they stopped TV altogether when they ended their cable contract. They also switched to a cheaper, shared data plan for their phones. The two also agreed that electronics be completely unplugged unless it was currently being used, that Peter arrive early to school to shower, and that laundry be done once every other week.</p><p>The shower situation really sucked, but Peter\u2019s least favorite cut-back was the food. May only bought enough food for breakfast and dinner, and Peter had to sign up for the free lunch program at school. Sometimes, when their cabinets looked truly empty, Aunt May would come home with a package of meat and a boxed starch, and Peter was sure that she had caved and stopped by a community soup kitchen on the way home. It had been really hard on him with his high metabolism, so lately Peter had been stopping at Ned\u2019s house on the way home from school for a snack. He felt guilty, but medical bills due to malnutrition were the last thing May should have to deal with.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2012\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t lie,\u201d Peter interjected.</p><p>May sighed again. Slowly, she turned her face to look at her nephew. She loved him so much. A kid shouldn\u2019t have to worry about finances. But things were looking bleak, and he deserved to know. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll have enough to pay the rent for next month.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>May, reading the panic in Peter\u2019s face, rushed to calm him. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry about it! I\u2019m already looking for another job\u2012\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have two,\u201d Peter noted. The teen was angry at himself for his inability to hide his emotions well. \u201cLet me get a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d May said, rejecting the idea. \u201cYou have school and the Stark internship. Those are too important for your future. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Really. It was getting boring anyway. I\u2019m not really getting anywhere with it. Not sure if I even want to be an engineer anymore,\u201d Peter lied.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d She stood up, brushed a stray piece of hair out of her nephew\u2019s eyes, and cupped his face.</p><p>Her eyes looked so sad. Peter was grateful for the dim lighting, hiding the tears that were forming in his own eyes. He took her hand off of his face and gave it a reassuring squeeze. \u201cThis is our best option,\u201d he spoke, forcing his voice to remain as steady as possible.</p><p>She looked away from him.</p><p>\u201cMay.

Are you hurt?\u201d\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cN-no\u201d, he\nanswers, head hanging low as he avoids meeting her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m okay. And don\u2019t\nworry about May, I told her I\u2019m sleeping over tonight.\u201d</p><p>Pepper\nfrowns, hand moving to Peter\u2019s chin, tipping it upwards with her index finger.\n\u201cBut no one was supposed to be here tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She wants\nto ask him why he wants to stay over in a huge yet empty building but when she\nlooks at him now, really looks at him, she doesn\u2019t have to.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s\nwearing one of Tony\u2019s favorite Black Sabbath t-shirt. It hangs loosely to his\nchest and almost swallows him up, making him look that much smaller. He has\nbeen curled up on Tony\u2019s side of the bed, too, with his cell phone right next\nto him as if he has been waiting for a call to wake him up.\u00a0</p><p>Without\nsaying another word she pulls his head to her chest, rubbing slow circles on\nhis neck, glad when he leans into her and starts to relax in her arms. For a\nwhile they just sit like this, both taking comfort in the other\u2019s proximity\nbecause Pepper understands him. She knows exactly what thoughts are running\nthrough his mind and how worried he is and how nothing anyone can say could\never make it feel better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nscared, too\u201d, she whispers into his curls finally and then continues with the\nwords people -\u00a0<i>Tony</i>\u00a0- have been telling her, hoping they would\nnot only reassure the teenager clinging to her but also her own racing\nthoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. He\u2019s going to come back home. Tony\u2019s\nfine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s like a\nmantra for both of them.\u00a0</p><p>She only\npulls away when she feels him slipping back to sleep, startling him with the\nmovement.\u00a0</p><p>Immediately\nhe sits up straighter but before he can apologize again and tell her he\u2019s going\nto his room as he undoubtedly has planned to, she cuts him off with a quick\nwave of her hand and a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going\nto get changed. You can stay here if you want. I know the sheets smell like\nhim. And I\u2019d feel better if I didn\u2019t have to be alone.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter nods\nand, reluctantly at first, climbs back under the sheets but as soon as his head\nhits Tony\u2019s pillow, he curls around it more firmly, closing his eyes and\nrelaxing at the scent.</p><p>When Pepper\ncomes back from the bathroom he\u2019s already fast asleep and she climbs in on the\nother side of the bed, pressing a kiss to the side of his head, before drifting\noff to sleep as well.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s\nanother three days until Tony comes back home and Peter has been staying at the\npenthouse, ever since that night Pepper has found him, with Pepper and Happy,\nfeeling just a little bit less worried and alone when he is around people who\ncare about his mentor as much as he does.\u00a0</p><p>The mission\nhas gone on far longer than anyone expected and the billionaire is so glad to\nfinally go home that he hasn\u2019t thought to call ahead.\u00a0</p><p>Pepper is\nsupposed to be in Florida for the next week anyway, so he\u2019s surprised when he\nfinds her things in the living room standing right next to a backpack that\nlooks suspiciously like it belongs to a certain Spiderkid.\u00a0</p><p>He checks\nPeter\u2019s room on the way to his bedroom, frowning when he finds it empty and the\nbed made. Quickly he wonders whether he should start worrying or if the kid has\njust forgotten his backpack here before Tony left.\u00a0</p><p><i>Two\nweeks without his backpack?\u00a0</i>No, that doesn\u2019t seem right.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s\npulling out his phone with one hand, already trying to phrase a text message to\nshoot the kid, while walking into his and Pepper\u2019s room and stops mid\nmotion.\u00a0</p><p>There lay\nhis wife and his kid, both curled around his pillow, both in one of his\nt-shirts and he can\u2019t help but smile at the image.

Quickly he wonders whether he should start worrying or if the kid has\njust forgotten his backpack here before Tony left.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Two\nweeks without his backpack?&nbsp;</i>No, that doesn&rsquo;t seem right.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s\npulling out his phone with one hand, already trying to phrase a text message to\nshoot the kid, while walking into his and Pepper&rsquo;s room and stops mid\nmotion.&nbsp;</p><p>There lay\nhis wife and his kid, both curled around his pillow, both in one of his\nt-shirts and he can&rsquo;t help but smile at the image. There&rsquo;s a warmth in his\nchest that makes him forget just how cold his bed has been the last two weeks\nand how much the mission has sucked.&nbsp;</p><p>Without a\nsecond thought he slips into the bed behind Peter - it&rsquo;s his side of the bed\nafter all - and quickly brushes the teenager&rsquo;s hair before dropping a kiss to\nthe top of his head and pulling him into his chest, close enough so that his\nother hand can reach Pepper whose eyes have fluttered open at the shift and\nbrushes his knuckles over her cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo;, he\nwhispers, grinning widely when Peter mumbles his name in his sleep and turns\naway from the pillow he has been hugging and instead goes to bury his head in\nTony&rsquo;s chest. He simply runs his hand through his curls and adjusts his\nposition before focusing back on Pepper.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Better\nnow&rdquo;, she replies with a soft smile, leaning forward to press a kiss to his\ncheek and moving in closer to both men, closing her eyes in content as she\nfeels Tony&rsquo;s fingers slowly starting to massage her scalp.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s how\nthey fall asleep and Tony can&rsquo;t name a single moment in his life when he has\nbeen happier because this is everything he has ever dreamt of.&nbsp;</p><p>Just him\nand his family.&nbsp;</p>",

Need to make a mental note to not write when tired or distracted by Hobbit: desolation of Smaug. Um for medical stuff and medicines i used what we use in the UK for pain relief. So paracetamol is what we call our main medicine for pain relief tha you can buy in prett much any shop. Anyways I hope you all enjoy! Let me know what you thought!</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p>\u201cDaddy, can I see Wade soon?\u201d Peter poked at his powered eggs that Sam had found in one of his bags that morning. Peter\u2019s appetite wasn\u2019t great at the moment, missing Wade has greatly affected it the past few days. \r</p><p>Bruce took up three plates for Natasha, Clint and Wade who were still in the quarantine room. Bruce was going up to do the last (hopefully) check on Wade, to see if he was in the all clear of the virus. If he was, he was going to be able to rejoin the group properly finally again; the group, as a result, were all thrumming with nervous energy. \r</p><p>Steve and Bucky were barely able to contain themselves as they waited for the final verdict, Tony was writing random equations out on small bits of paper as he talked to his son. Trying to redirect his own nervous energy as well as Peter\u2019s, to prevent either of them from just running up the stairs. Neither were any good at waiting, and today was no exception, the only thing really keeping them in place was the threat of Bruce\u2019s disappointed glare. \r</p><p>\u201cHopefully soon, Bruce is just going to check on him right now baby boy ok? Remember when I said that Wade was a bit ill? Well, Bruce is just checking to see if he\u2019s better again ok?\u201d\r</p><p>Nodding, Peter continued to poke at his food, despite it being the first warm meal in ages that they got to eat. \u201cI remember Daddy\u201d \r</p><p>The hand not being used to eat, was idly petting Punk\u2019s head that rested on his lap, hoping for any scraps of food that may fall down; despite already having eaten a bowl of food already. Pulling out a chair besides Peter, Steve looks down with a soft smile and ruffles Peter\u2019s hair, messing up further the curled locks. \r</p><p>\u201cWade may not be up to much, but maybe you can show him around the place with someone? Wade hasn\u2019t had a good look around yet I bet, you can show him the massive game room up stairs as well?\u201d \r</p><p>Brightening up instantly, Peter nods enthusiastically shovelling in a mouthful of food finally, much to Tony\u2019s joy. \r</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Steve raises an eyebrow as Peter tries to speak with a full mouth, causing him to giggle and swallow before he attempts talking again. \u201cI can show him the bamboo hut in the garden as well!\u201d  \r</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Grinning, Steve nods at the now more happier child, he catches Tony thanking him from behind Peter\u2018s head. \r</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony stood up to get some more water to drink, rubbing Bucky\u2019s arm as he passes him. \r</p><p>It\u2019s not long till they all hear footsteps coming down the hall, even Loki pauses from cleaning his weapons to see if Bruce brings good news. Excited, Peter drops his cutlery as he scrambles out of his chair and he would have fallen off in his rush had Steve not managed to grab him in time. \r</p><p>\u201cPeter wait! Hang on wiggle butt before you hurt yourself,\u201d Chuckling, Steve gets Peter out of the chair and hands him to Bucky to hold onto him, just in case it\u2019s bad news. Smirking, Bucky effortlessly holds the squirming child and ruffles his hair affectionately, when Peter gives a small whine in protest to being held. \r</p><p>Moving to the front of the kitchen, Steve stands facing the door as it creeks open, Bruce\u2019s head pop\u2019s around the corner first before the rest of him quickly follows. The group in the kitchen moves closer anxiously, all eyes trained on the Doctor as he fiddles with his glasses.\r</p><p>\u201cBruce-\u201c\r</p><p>\u201cIs Wade ok?!\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cuts over everyone else\u2019s as he impatiently strains against Bucky\u2019s arms, his head craning to the side as if that would help him see around the door. Grinning, Bruce pushes the door to make it swing open instead of answering. Stood there in his usually jeans and hoodie was Wade, looking as healthy as he did the day before the bite; not a single hint of any sign that he was liable to turn into a Deado. \r</p><p>\u201cWade!!\u201d Squealing and writhing to be put down, Peter dashes to Wade the moment his little feet made contact with the ground. Peter\u2019s face split wide with a smile of pure joy at finally seeing his friend. Grinning widely, Wade manages to catch the speeding smaller body as it hurtles into him like a tiny torpedo. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Petey, miss me?\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cYeah! Missed you lots, I have so much to show you! There\u2019s this awesome bamboo garden outside that Steve and me found!\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cOoh sounds cool,\u201d Smiling the elder boy hugs Peter hard. All of the adults knew the separation wasn\u2019t easy on both of the kids, having made a fast friendship, they didn\u2019t like to be apart. Tony found it endearing that the two boys had such a strong connection already. It often reminded him of his and Rhodey\u2019s own relationship.\r</p><p>Oh god does Tony miss his best friend, all he could do was hope that both him and Pepper and hopefully Happy as well, where all ok. Surviving and getting by, hopefully travelling together or in a bigger group for safety. Before he could get too focused on his own thoughts, Tony forcibly brings himself back into the present and smiles fondly as the two boys move to the table. Tony snagged a quick hug as the Wade passed, expressing his relief that he was ok.  \r</p><p>Everyone in the room has practically sagged in silent relief at Wade being ok, but it leaves a big question to be answered. How was it he was able to survive? \r</p><p>After Wade had come in, Natasha and Clint silently slipped into the kitchen, Clint making a beeline for the coffee; glad that they had found some on their newest raids. All clean from the newly working showers, everyone looks much better after having been able to finally clean themselves properly again. Quietly, Tony makes his way to Bruce\u2019s side who was sat next to Natasha at the table, leaning his head on her shoulder. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Brucie, rough few days?\u201d Whispering, Tony grins a bit as he nudges his old science buddy. Humming, Bruce glances at Tony before turning his curious gaze onto Wade, the scientist was intrigued as well as baffled by the boy. \r</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. Say Tony, how do you think Wade survived the bite? Not one person before has survived and yet, here is a small kid who has actually beaten it. Simply amazing\u2026\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cI know, damn Bruce, if we had the equipment we could potentially figure out a cure or preventative\u201d Tony pauses as a thought comes to him, \u201cBruce, would the small medical centre in town have blood analysing equipment?\u201d\r</p><p>Frowning, Bruce hums quietly as he thinks it over, accepting a new coffee from Sam as he passes them all new cups. \r</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if they got equipment in the early stages of all this to handle local cases, most local centres where given extra equipment to try and give them a chance to find a cure or at least keep the spread minimum. So if this place managed to get some before it was to late, they would have pretty much all the equipment we would need.\u201d \r</p><p>Sitting up again, Bruce leans back as they whisper so as to not alarm the chattering kids across from them. Steve remains by the kids trying to minimise the mess as Wade eats another plate of food. Bucky had moved to sit in a chair behind the two genius\u2019s, listening intently to them as they brainstormed. The gods remained where they were but were no doubt listening in as well. Sam and Clint where over by the coffee pot chatting quietly to themselves, oblivious to everything else going on around them. \r</p><p>Tapping a finger on his cheek, Tony leans on his left hand as he sips his own drink, contemplating this. \r</p><p>\u201cWe need to make that run into town sooner rather than later then. If any machines are salvageable, we want to be the ones to get them.\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cEither me or you need to go Tony, we are the only ones that know what we are looking for really-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cTony can go, you need to rest after the last few days of watching over Wade. Me and Clint have been up all night so us going would be risky as well.\u201d Natasha cut in, her tone like steel as she levels Bruce a look, she disliked it when Bruce neglected to care for himself at times. However, Tony could see the signs of exhaustion from the nights being up and stressing over Wade and having to be constantly on edge. She and Clint had taken most of the shifts, alternating with Sam and Bruce to minimise the contact between Wade and Peter and the possibility of the virus being carried over. \r</p><p>Before all this, this would have been easy for the ex-black widow, but weeks of being on edge near constantly and sleepless nights from old nightmares as well as new ones, has drained her as it has all of them. Even the super soldiers where often looking worse for wear, whereas before they could of gone strong for days in a row. They all took the chance to rest when they could, not knowing when they would next have that chance. \r</p><p>Nodding in agreement with Natasha, Tony claps a hand onto Bruce\u2019s shoulder and grins, \u201cI will take care of it ok? I\u2019ll to the guys and we will figure out an action plan ok?\u201d \r</p><p>Later on, out in the gardens, Thor sat in the bamboo den with the two kids playing some kind of game. Loki, Bucky and Steve stood nearby listening to Tony explain his and Bruce\u2019s conversation from that morning,  Sam was sat next to Tony on a bench facing the three standing Dom\u2019s. None looked to happy to take Tony out in a potentially deadly situation, but none could dispute Tony\u2019s statement that none of them even remotely knew what to look for. \r</p><p>\u201cMe, Thor, Loki and Bucky will go into town with you. You will stick close to one of us the entire time ok? We don\u2019t know how dangerous the centre will be so we need to be really careful, we can\u2019t loose you nor Bruce as you are our best bets of surviving this.\u201d Crossing his arm over his broad chest, Steve gave Tony his Captain America look. To his right, Bucky had a similar look and stance, only his actually looked a tad more intimidating. \r</p><p>\u201cCross my heart Cap, I\u2019ll be a good boy the entire time, scouts honour.\u201d Smirking up at the Dom, Tony cheekily salutes at him, winking for added measure. \u201cOh and Bruce wants  this if anyone can find it,\u201d smirking Tony hands Steve a piece of paper that has the item Bruce wants scribbled down on. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gives Tony an incredulous look but nods pocketing the bit of paper without another word. \r</p><p>The next morning, Steve, Bucky, Thor, Loki and Tony set out to the town. They had decided to wait till this morning so that they could make use of as much daylight as they could and have more time to prepare for this. Steve even double checked with Bruce about the item he had written down, face blank, Bruce confirmed that yes what he wrote was correct. \r</p><p>\u201cHow do we want to do this, we need to do a general run on the other shops as well so do we hit the medical centre or the town shops first?\u201d Getting out of the truck they took to be able to carry everything they find, leaving the car for the others in-case of an emergency; Steve checked his gear and weapons as he directed his question to the others. \r</p><p>\u201cMedical, it\u2019s more of a priority than the other stores. The medical would have food stocked up for the patients they took in and the workers as well as equipment. As most people would avoid a potential death trap, it would make sense for them to target the smaller local stores.\u201d Tony fiddled with his gauntlet and picked up one of his devices. That is, one of his flashing bombs that flashes when he presses a button and then explodes after a few moments. A way to check inside and to lure away the attention of possible Deado\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t overly powerful either at a small distance but it was enough to damage the Deado\u2019s that get to close. \r</p><p>\u201cI actually agree with Stark for once,\u201d leaning against the truck\u2019s side, Loki twirled a dagger in his hands, idly playing with it; Bucky watching impressed at the skill Loki obviously possessed. Steve was not looking forward to those two trading dagger wielding tips. Pushing against the truck with his hip, Loki stood to his full height and lazily looked around at the building in front of them. They had pulled up across the road from the medical centre, giving themselves more running distance to put between them and any Deado\u2019s that chase them out. \r</p><p>\u201cI believe the best approach would be my self and Stark sneaking in to check the outside, find the best way in-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Steve cut n, growling at Loki, not being able to help his knee jerk reaction to wanting to keep Tony away from danger as best as he can. Huffing with annoyance, Loki sends him a withering glare. \r</p><p>\u201cRogers, may I remind you that we are some of the more faster and sneakier of the group? Yes Barnes is faster than Stark but his arm could reflect the sunlight. Catching the eye of a group of those things. Thor is useless at sneaking and you and him are both bright and large. The best options would be me and Stark and you know it.\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cSteve, it\u2019s ok I can take care of myself,\u201d putting a soothing hand on Steve\u2019s arm, Tony gave him a reassuring grin. \u201cYou know Lo-Lo is right-\u201c\r</p><p>\u201cLo-Lo?!\u201d \r</p><p>\u201c-besides, he won\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d Grinning brightly, happy to ignore the burning glare that was being aimed at him from Loki. \r</p><p>Still not completely convinced, Steve looks over at Bucky. Bucky himself didn\u2019t look to pleased with the plan, but Steve could see that Bucky agreed, even if reluctantly, with this plan. \r</p><p>\u201cOne strand of hair misplaced Loki\u2026\u201d Bucky growled quietly at Loki, a knife was twirled in his hands threateningly. Scoffing, Loki turned his back on them, already walking towards the building causing Tony to hurry after him. \r</p><p>\u201cHe will be returned in pristine condition.\u201d\r</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r</p><p>\u201cHey Steve, do you think at one point Tony had a sex dungeon?\u201d\r</p><p>Blinking in shock, Steve looks over his shoulder at his best friend- where had that random question come from? Since Loki and Tony had left to do the recon, Thor moved to sit in the truck in case they need a quick getaway while Bucky and Steve were stood in the middle of the road, backs together as they keep watch both ways. \r</p><p>\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s all that\u2019s on your mind right now?\u201d Steve asked Bucky Incredulously, peeking over his shoulder at Bucky before turning to face forward again. \r</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah I mean Wade is ok- I mean fuck Steve; Wade is the first to survive a bite from a Deado that we know of! I\u2019m not as smart as Tony or Bruce to properly geek out over it, and we can\u2019t work out the how or why until we get this machine stuff back to the mansion. So my brain is focusing on what I\u2019m good at\u201d smirking, Bucky scanned the streets and buildings, unable to help but feel like they are being watched. But he couldn\u2019t sense anyone, it was unnerving and frustrating for the former Winter Soldier. \r</p><p>\u201cSniping?..\u201d Steve said hopefully, trying to turn the subject away from Tony\u2019s sex history. Just the thought was making his blood rush south, his mind wandering as it imagined what tony would look like. Firmly and with a great show of will, Steve forced those thoughts away for later.\r</p><p>\u201cThat and sex. Hey think we could get Tony to agree to some old fashioned movie troupe like sexy times? Me and you or just me in a tree with a scope? Watching him tease in a window, hell maybe you\u2019re in there with him to tease me. Watching you two get it on while I can only watch-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cJesus fuck Bucky\u201d coughing uncomfortably, face bright red as images again sprang to his mind, making his body heat up in both arousal and discomfort. \u201cNow isn\u2019t really the time to be talking about things like that jerk.\u201d \r</p><p>Steve huffed when all he got in return was a chuckle from Bucky, that jerk knew exactly how that affected him. Their senses were much sharper than a normal Dom\u2019s, even without the serum though, Bucky would have been able to smell how affected Steve was by his words just now. \r</p><p>Taking deep long calming breathes, Steve managed to get himself back under control just as Loki and Tony came back, walking around the far left of the building, the very same direction that Steve was currently facing. Relief flooded him, as Steve started walking to meet them half way, his eyes moving over Tony critically looking for any signs of injury. \r</p><p>\u201cAs you can see Captain, I have brought him back free of injury. We even found a good way in\u201d smirking, the god of mischief waved his brother over who was still in the car, Bucky had followed Steve once he noticed that Steve had left his post. \r</p><p>\u201cGood, lets get this over with then. How many Deado\u2019 could you see inside from your recon?\u201d \r</p><p>Loki gave them a run down of which rooms in which sections they saw the most Dead, using a stick he drew a rough map in the dirt.\r</p><p>\u201cThis room here, where most of the patients where housed, seems to be full of them. The windows were partially blocked by tables, to prevent outside Dead from looking in I suppose. Most of the rooms were empty but locked up tight, we would have better chances getting into them from the inside. This room here,\u201d Loki points to one part of the map for Steve. \u201cHad some more Dead, mainly staff it appears. The door however is bolted on the inside thankfully, someone must had locked the door before being killed from the inside. On the other hand he room is a research lab room, one with most of the machines Tony and Bruce need\u201d \r</p><p>Impressed with how thorough they had been, Steve nod his thanks before using his foot to scuff the dirt, erasing the map. Steve decided to push the bit of info about the research lab to the back of his mind for now, maybe they will find another room with machines that they could use. If not, they may have to take on that room. \r</p><p>\u201cYou did well, show us the way in and lets get what we need fast, are the patients locked in?\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cNot that we can tell but the door was locked. We thought that maybe the door was blocked or locked from the other side maybe\u201d Tony informs him quietly as the group make their way around the back. \r</p><p>Getting in, as Loki had said, was easy. They found a side door that was unlocked that lead to a kitchen, the kitchen itself was empty as well as the immediate hallway beyond. A quick raid of the kitchen yielded some more food that they took. \r</p><p>Moving fast but quietly they made their way through fast, checking rooms as they go. Many were useless to them apart from the occasional computer or fan in the offices. They decided to come back for those once they were sure they could carry them without threat of being mauled alive. \r</p><p>Occasionally they came across a Deado or two; staff members that had been locked out of the room where the rest where; but were able to swiftly dispatch them before they could make much sound, alerting others of the alive humans nearby. \r</p><p>True to Tony\u2019s and Loki\u2019s predictions, the room with all the patients in was locked and barred from the outside. The staff had obviously attempted to isolate a situation that was beyond their help and tried to prevent it spreading. Grateful for this mercy, the group moved on and soon found a storage room, boxes and boxes of medication and equipment lined the room and shelves.  \r</p><p>\u201cLoki and Thor- take that end and sort through what\u2019s useful or what wont be, basically take anything that isn\u2019t perishable or is machinery\u201d gives them a copy of the list Bruce gave them, including that certain item that Steve still has no idea what it is. \u201cHere is a list, make these priority if you can\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cAye Captain.\u201d \r</p><p>Each team moved to their end of the room, spreading out to check through the boxes for anything of use. Tony gave a little uttered cheers when he finds something particularly useful, a pile near the doorway rapidly forming. \r</p><p>Shifting through a box, Bucky cleared out anything perished or useless, the next box was filled with medicine for all sorts of ailments and conditions. Many names jumped out at Bucky, more than half he had no hope in properly pronouncing but some he recognised. The ones he did he placed in his backpack along with a few boxes from the list. Just as Bucky was about to move the rest of the box to a pile to take but not priority, he spots a certain name. One that Steve had shown him and looked at many times in confusion since Bruce had given it to him. \r</p><p>N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanamide. \r</p><p>Bucky grinned when he saw the chemical name of the medicine, however the grin fell when he saw it\u2019s common name above. Seeing the common name, Bucky cursed a blue streak in Bruce\u2019s name, that lil scientist dick. Still, Bucky couldn\u2019t help the grin on his face from forming. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Stevie, I found the medicine Bruce asked for,\u201d picking up the box with a grin, Bucky gleefully handed it over to his oh so trusting best friend, waiting for Steve to read it and realise what Bruce had done. Unsurprisingly, Tony paused in his search to look over, his eyes lighting up with mischief. Now, Bucky could understand his expression back when the request was made. \r</p><p>Much to Bucky\u2019s delight, Steve\u2019s facial journey was a thing of beauty and couldn\u2019t help but wish Bruce was here to see it himself. Bucky decided to commit this to memory so that he could tell Bruce how successful his prank is. \r</p><p>First was the trusting relief at having found something one of their group apparently needed. Then came the surprise quickly followed by a look that was just pure resignation but humour, behind Steve, Bucky could hear Tony snort in laughter as Steve swore loudly. \r</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s damn paracetamol!\u201d \r</p>",

Need to make a mental note to not write when tired or distracted by Hobbit: desolation of Smaug. Um for medical stuff and medicines i used what we use in the UK for pain relief. So paracetamol is what we call our main medicine for pain relief tha you can buy in prett much any shop. Anyways I hope you all enjoy! Let me know what you thought!</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p>\u201cDaddy, can I see Wade soon?\u201d Peter poked at his powered eggs that Sam had found in one of his bags that morning. Peter\u2019s appetite wasn\u2019t great at the moment, missing Wade has greatly affected it the past few days. \r</p><p>Bruce took up three plates for Natasha, Clint and Wade who were still in the quarantine room. Bruce was going up to do the last (hopefully) check on Wade, to see if he was in the all clear of the virus. If he was, he was going to be able to rejoin the group properly finally again; the group, as a result, were all thrumming with nervous energy. \r</p><p>Steve and Bucky were barely able to contain themselves as they waited for the final verdict, Tony was writing random equations out on small bits of paper as he talked to his son. Trying to redirect his own nervous energy as well as Peter\u2019s, to prevent either of them from just running up the stairs. Neither were any good at waiting, and today was no exception, the only thing really keeping them in place was the threat of Bruce\u2019s disappointed glare. \r</p><p>\u201cHopefully soon, Bruce is just going to check on him right now baby boy ok? Remember when I said that Wade was a bit ill? Well, Bruce is just checking to see if he\u2019s better again ok?\u201d\r</p><p>Nodding, Peter continued to poke at his food, despite it being the first warm meal in ages that they got to eat. \u201cI remember Daddy\u201d \r</p><p>The hand not being used to eat, was idly petting Punk\u2019s head that rested on his lap, hoping for any scraps of food that may fall down; despite already having eaten a bowl of food already. Pulling out a chair besides Peter, Steve looks down with a soft smile and ruffles Peter\u2019s hair, messing up further the curled locks. \r</p><p>\u201cWade may not be up to much, but maybe you can show him around the place with someone? Wade hasn\u2019t had a good look around yet I bet, you can show him the massive game room up stairs as well?\u201d \r</p><p>Brightening up instantly, Peter nods enthusiastically shovelling in a mouthful of food finally, much to Tony\u2019s joy. \r</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Steve raises an eyebrow as Peter tries to speak with a full mouth, causing him to giggle and swallow before he attempts talking again. \u201cI can show him the bamboo hut in the garden as well!\u201d  \r</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Grinning, Steve nods at the now more happier child, he catches Tony thanking him from behind Peter\u2018s head. \r</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony stood up to get some more water to drink, rubbing Bucky\u2019s arm as he passes him. \r</p><p>It\u2019s not long till they all hear footsteps coming down the hall, even Loki pauses from cleaning his weapons to see if Bruce brings good news. Excited, Peter drops his cutlery as he scrambles out of his chair and he would have fallen off in his rush had Steve not managed to grab him in time. \r</p><p>\u201cPeter wait! Hang on wiggle butt before you hurt yourself,\u201d Chuckling, Steve gets Peter out of the chair and hands him to Bucky to hold onto him, just in case it\u2019s bad news. Smirking, Bucky effortlessly holds the squirming child and ruffles his hair affectionately, when Peter gives a small whine in protest to being held. \r</p><p>Moving to the front of the kitchen, Steve stands facing the door as it creeks open, Bruce\u2019s head pop\u2019s around the corner first before the rest of him quickly follows. The group in the kitchen moves closer anxiously, all eyes trained on the Doctor as he fiddles with his glasses.\r</p><p>\u201cBruce-\u201c\r</p><p>\u201cIs Wade ok?!\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cuts over everyone else\u2019s as he impatiently strains against Bucky\u2019s arms, his head craning to the side as if that would help him see around the door. Grinning, Bruce pushes the door to make it swing open instead of answering. Stood there in his usually jeans and hoodie was Wade, looking as healthy as he did the day before the bite; not a single hint of any sign that he was liable to turn into a Deado. \r</p><p>\u201cWade!!\u201d Squealing and writhing to be put down, Peter dashes to Wade the moment his little feet made contact with the ground. Peter\u2019s face split wide with a smile of pure joy at finally seeing his friend. Grinning widely, Wade manages to catch the speeding smaller body as it hurtles into him like a tiny torpedo. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Petey, miss me?\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cYeah! Missed you lots, I have so much to show you! There\u2019s this awesome bamboo garden outside that Steve and me found!\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cOoh sounds cool,\u201d Smiling the elder boy hugs Peter hard. All of the adults knew the separation wasn\u2019t easy on both of the kids, having made a fast friendship, they didn\u2019t like to be apart. Tony found it endearing that the two boys had such a strong connection already. It often reminded him of his and Rhodey\u2019s own relationship.\r</p><p>Oh god does Tony miss his best friend, all he could do was hope that both him and Pepper and hopefully Happy as well, where all ok. Surviving and getting by, hopefully travelling together or in a bigger group for safety. Before he could get too focused on his own thoughts, Tony forcibly brings himself back into the present and smiles fondly as the two boys move to the table. Tony snagged a quick hug as the Wade passed, expressing his relief that he was ok.  \r</p><p>Everyone in the room has practically sagged in silent relief at Wade being ok, but it leaves a big question to be answered. How was it he was able to survive? \r</p><p>After Wade had come in, Natasha and Clint silently slipped into the kitchen, Clint making a beeline for the coffee; glad that they had found some on their newest raids. All clean from the newly working showers, everyone looks much better after having been able to finally clean themselves properly again. Quietly, Tony makes his way to Bruce\u2019s side who was sat next to Natasha at the table, leaning his head on her shoulder. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Brucie, rough few days?\u201d Whispering, Tony grins a bit as he nudges his old science buddy. Humming, Bruce glances at Tony before turning his curious gaze onto Wade, the scientist was intrigued as well as baffled by the boy. \r</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. Say Tony, how do you think Wade survived the bite? Not one person before has survived and yet, here is a small kid who has actually beaten it. Simply amazing\u2026\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cI know, damn Bruce, if we had the equipment we could potentially figure out a cure or preventative\u201d Tony pauses as a thought comes to him, \u201cBruce, would the small medical centre in town have blood analysing equipment?\u201d\r</p><p>Frowning, Bruce hums quietly as he thinks it over, accepting a new coffee from Sam as he passes them all new cups. \r</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if they got equipment in the early stages of all this to handle local cases, most local centres where given extra equipment to try and give them a chance to find a cure or at least keep the spread minimum. So if this place managed to get some before it was to late, they would have pretty much all the equipment we would need.\u201d \r</p><p>Sitting up again, Bruce leans back as they whisper so as to not alarm the chattering kids across from them. Steve remains by the kids trying to minimise the mess as Wade eats another plate of food. Bucky had moved to sit in a chair behind the two genius\u2019s, listening intently to them as they brainstormed. The gods remained where they were but were no doubt listening in as well. Sam and Clint where over by the coffee pot chatting quietly to themselves, oblivious to everything else going on around them. \r</p><p>Tapping a finger on his cheek, Tony leans on his left hand as he sips his own drink, contemplating this. \r</p><p>\u201cWe need to make that run into town sooner rather than later then. If any machines are salvageable, we want to be the ones to get them.\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cEither me or you need to go Tony, we are the only ones that know what we are looking for really-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cTony can go, you need to rest after the last few days of watching over Wade. Me and Clint have been up all night so us going would be risky as well.\u201d Natasha cut in, her tone like steel as she levels Bruce a look, she disliked it when Bruce neglected to care for himself at times. However, Tony could see the signs of exhaustion from the nights being up and stressing over Wade and having to be constantly on edge. She and Clint had taken most of the shifts, alternating with Sam and Bruce to minimise the contact between Wade and Peter and the possibility of the virus being carried over. \r</p><p>Before all this, this would have been easy for the ex-black widow, but weeks of being on edge near constantly and sleepless nights from old nightmares as well as new ones, has drained her as it has all of them. Even the super soldiers where often looking worse for wear, whereas before they could of gone strong for days in a row. They all took the chance to rest when they could, not knowing when they would next have that chance. \r</p><p>Nodding in agreement with Natasha, Tony claps a hand onto Bruce\u2019s shoulder and grins, \u201cI will take care of it ok? I\u2019ll to the guys and we will figure out an action plan ok?\u201d \r</p><p>Later on, out in the gardens, Thor sat in the bamboo den with the two kids playing some kind of game. Loki, Bucky and Steve stood nearby listening to Tony explain his and Bruce\u2019s conversation from that morning,  Sam was sat next to Tony on a bench facing the three standing Dom\u2019s. None looked to happy to take Tony out in a potentially deadly situation, but none could dispute Tony\u2019s statement that none of them even remotely knew what to look for. \r</p><p>\u201cMe, Thor, Loki and Bucky will go into town with you. You will stick close to one of us the entire time ok? We don\u2019t know how dangerous the centre will be so we need to be really careful, we can\u2019t loose you nor Bruce as you are our best bets of surviving this.\u201d Crossing his arm over his broad chest, Steve gave Tony his Captain America look. To his right, Bucky had a similar look and stance, only his actually looked a tad more intimidating. \r</p><p>\u201cCross my heart Cap, I\u2019ll be a good boy the entire time, scouts honour.\u201d Smirking up at the Dom, Tony cheekily salutes at him, winking for added measure. \u201cOh and Bruce wants  this if anyone can find it,\u201d smirking Tony hands Steve a piece of paper that has the item Bruce wants scribbled down on. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gives Tony an incredulous look but nods pocketing the bit of paper without another word. \r</p><p>The next morning, Steve, Bucky, Thor, Loki and Tony set out to the town. They had decided to wait till this morning so that they could make use of as much daylight as they could and have more time to prepare for this. Steve even double checked with Bruce about the item he had written down, face blank, Bruce confirmed that yes what he wrote was correct. \r</p><p>\u201cHow do we want to do this, we need to do a general run on the other shops as well so do we hit the medical centre or the town shops first?\u201d Getting out of the truck they took to be able to carry everything they find, leaving the car for the others in-case of an emergency; Steve checked his gear and weapons as he directed his question to the others. \r</p><p>\u201cMedical, it\u2019s more of a priority than the other stores. The medical would have food stocked up for the patients they took in and the workers as well as equipment. As most people would avoid a potential death trap, it would make sense for them to target the smaller local stores.\u201d Tony fiddled with his gauntlet and picked up one of his devices. That is, one of his flashing bombs that flashes when he presses a button and then explodes after a few moments. A way to check inside and to lure away the attention of possible Deado\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t overly powerful either at a small distance but it was enough to damage the Deado\u2019s that get to close. \r</p><p>\u201cI actually agree with Stark for once,\u201d leaning against the truck\u2019s side, Loki twirled a dagger in his hands, idly playing with it; Bucky watching impressed at the skill Loki obviously possessed. Steve was not looking forward to those two trading dagger wielding tips. Pushing against the truck with his hip, Loki stood to his full height and lazily looked around at the building in front of them. They had pulled up across the road from the medical centre, giving themselves more running distance to put between them and any Deado\u2019s that chase them out. \r</p><p>\u201cI believe the best approach would be my self and Stark sneaking in to check the outside, find the best way in-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Steve cut n, growling at Loki, not being able to help his knee jerk reaction to wanting to keep Tony away from danger as best as he can. Huffing with annoyance, Loki sends him a withering glare. \r</p><p>\u201cRogers, may I remind you that we are some of the more faster and sneakier of the group? Yes Barnes is faster than Stark but his arm could reflect the sunlight. Catching the eye of a group of those things. Thor is useless at sneaking and you and him are both bright and large. The best options would be me and Stark and you know it.\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cSteve, it\u2019s ok I can take care of myself,\u201d putting a soothing hand on Steve\u2019s arm, Tony gave him a reassuring grin. \u201cYou know Lo-Lo is right-\u201c\r</p><p>\u201cLo-Lo?!\u201d \r</p><p>\u201c-besides, he won\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d Grinning brightly, happy to ignore the burning glare that was being aimed at him from Loki. \r</p><p>Still not completely convinced, Steve looks over at Bucky. Bucky himself didn\u2019t look to pleased with the plan, but Steve could see that Bucky agreed, even if reluctantly, with this plan. \r</p><p>\u201cOne strand of hair misplaced Loki\u2026\u201d Bucky growled quietly at Loki, a knife was twirled in his hands threateningly. Scoffing, Loki turned his back on them, already walking towards the building causing Tony to hurry after him. \r</p><p>\u201cHe will be returned in pristine condition.\u201d\r</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r</p><p>\u201cHey Steve, do you think at one point Tony had a sex dungeon?\u201d\r</p><p>Blinking in shock, Steve looks over his shoulder at his best friend- where had that random question come from? Since Loki and Tony had left to do the recon, Thor moved to sit in the truck in case they need a quick getaway while Bucky and Steve were stood in the middle of the road, backs together as they keep watch both ways. \r</p><p>\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s all that\u2019s on your mind right now?\u201d Steve asked Bucky Incredulously, peeking over his shoulder at Bucky before turning to face forward again. \r</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah I mean Wade is ok- I mean fuck Steve; Wade is the first to survive a bite from a Deado that we know of! I\u2019m not as smart as Tony or Bruce to properly geek out over it, and we can\u2019t work out the how or why until we get this machine stuff back to the mansion. So my brain is focusing on what I\u2019m good at\u201d smirking, Bucky scanned the streets and buildings, unable to help but feel like they are being watched. But he couldn\u2019t sense anyone, it was unnerving and frustrating for the former Winter Soldier. \r</p><p>\u201cSniping?..\u201d Steve said hopefully, trying to turn the subject away from Tony\u2019s sex history. Just the thought was making his blood rush south, his mind wandering as it imagined what tony would look like. Firmly and with a great show of will, Steve forced those thoughts away for later.\r</p><p>\u201cThat and sex. Hey think we could get Tony to agree to some old fashioned movie troupe like sexy times? Me and you or just me in a tree with a scope? Watching him tease in a window, hell maybe you\u2019re in there with him to tease me. Watching you two get it on while I can only watch-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cJesus fuck Bucky\u201d coughing uncomfortably, face bright red as images again sprang to his mind, making his body heat up in both arousal and discomfort. \u201cNow isn\u2019t really the time to be talking about things like that jerk.\u201d \r</p><p>Steve huffed when all he got in return was a chuckle from Bucky, that jerk knew exactly how that affected him. Their senses were much sharper than a normal Dom\u2019s, even without the serum though, Bucky would have been able to smell how affected Steve was by his words just now. \r</p><p>Taking deep long calming breathes, Steve managed to get himself back under control just as Loki and Tony came back, walking around the far left of the building, the very same direction that Steve was currently facing. Relief flooded him, as Steve started walking to meet them half way, his eyes moving over Tony critically looking for any signs of injury. \r</p><p>\u201cAs you can see Captain, I have brought him back free of injury. We even found a good way in\u201d smirking, the god of mischief waved his brother over who was still in the car, Bucky had followed Steve once he noticed that Steve had left his post. \r</p><p>\u201cGood, lets get this over with then.

This room here,\u201d Loki points to one part of the map for Steve. \u201cHad some more Dead, mainly staff it appears. The door however is bolted on the inside thankfully, someone must had locked the door before being killed from the inside. On the other hand he room is a research lab room, one with most of the machines Tony and Bruce need\u201d \r</p><p>Impressed with how thorough they had been, Steve nod his thanks before using his foot to scuff the dirt, erasing the map. Steve decided to push the bit of info about the research lab to the back of his mind for now, maybe they will find another room with machines that they could use. If not, they may have to take on that room. \r</p><p>\u201cYou did well, show us the way in and lets get what we need fast, are the patients locked in?\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cNot that we can tell but the door was locked. We thought that maybe the door was blocked or locked from the other side maybe\u201d Tony informs him quietly as the group make their way around the back. \r</p><p>Getting in, as Loki had said, was easy. They found a side door that was unlocked that lead to a kitchen, the kitchen itself was empty as well as the immediate hallway beyond. A quick raid of the kitchen yielded some more food that they took. \r</p><p>Moving fast but quietly they made their way through fast, checking rooms as they go. Many were useless to them apart from the occasional computer or fan in the offices. They decided to come back for those once they were sure they could carry them without threat of being mauled alive. \r</p><p>Occasionally they came across a Deado or two; staff members that had been locked out of the room where the rest where; but were able to swiftly dispatch them before they could make much sound, alerting others of the alive humans nearby. \r</p><p>True to Tony\u2019s and Loki\u2019s predictions, the room with all the patients in was locked and barred from the outside. The staff had obviously attempted to isolate a situation that was beyond their help and tried to prevent it spreading. Grateful for this mercy, the group moved on and soon found a storage room, boxes and boxes of medication and equipment lined the room and shelves.  \r</p><p>\u201cLoki and Thor- take that end and sort through what\u2019s useful or what wont be, basically take anything that isn\u2019t perishable or is machinery\u201d gives them a copy of the list Bruce gave them, including that certain item that Steve still has no idea what it is. \u201cHere is a list, make these priority if you can\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cAye Captain.\u201d \r</p><p>Each team moved to their end of the room, spreading out to check through the boxes for anything of use. Tony gave a little uttered cheers when he finds something particularly useful, a pile near the doorway rapidly forming. \r</p><p>Shifting through a box, Bucky cleared out anything perished or useless, the next box was filled with medicine for all sorts of ailments and conditions. Many names jumped out at Bucky, more than half he had no hope in properly pronouncing but some he recognised. The ones he did he placed in his backpack along with a few boxes from the list. Just as Bucky was about to move the rest of the box to a pile to take but not priority, he spots a certain name. One that Steve had shown him and looked at many times in confusion since Bruce had given it to him. \r</p><p>N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanamide. \r</p><p>Bucky grinned when he saw the chemical name of the medicine, however the grin fell when he saw it\u2019s common name above. Seeing the common name, Bucky cursed a blue streak in Bruce\u2019s name, that lil scientist dick. Still, Bucky couldn\u2019t help the grin on his face from forming. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Stevie, I found the medicine Bruce asked for,\u201d picking up the box with a grin, Bucky gleefully handed it over to his oh so trusting best friend, waiting for Steve to read it and realise what Bruce had done. Unsurprisingly, Tony paused in his search to look over, his eyes lighting up with mischief. Now, Bucky could understand his expression back when the request was made. \r</p><p>Much to Bucky\u2019s delight, Steve\u2019s facial journey was a thing of beauty and couldn\u2019t help but wish Bruce was here to see it himself. Bucky decided to commit this to memory so that he could tell Bruce how successful his prank is. \r</p><p>First was the trusting relief at having found something one of their group apparently needed. Then came the surprise quickly followed by a look that was just pure resignation but humour, behind Steve, Bucky could hear Tony snort in laughter as Steve swore loudly. \r</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s damn paracetamol!\u201d \r</p></p>",

Need to make a mental note to not write when tired or distracted by Hobbit: desolation of Smaug. Um for medical stuff and medicines i used what we use in the UK for pain relief. So paracetamol is what we call our main medicine for pain relief tha you can buy in prett much any shop. Anyways I hope you all enjoy! Let me know what you thought!</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p>\u201cDaddy, can I see Wade soon?\u201d Peter poked at his powered eggs that Sam had found in one of his bags that morning. Peter\u2019s appetite wasn\u2019t great at the moment, missing Wade has greatly affected it the past few days. \r</p><p>Bruce took up three plates for Natasha, Clint and Wade who were still in the quarantine room. Bruce was going up to do the last (hopefully) check on Wade, to see if he was in the all clear of the virus. If he was, he was going to be able to rejoin the group properly finally again; the group, as a result, were all thrumming with nervous energy. \r</p><p>Steve and Bucky were barely able to contain themselves as they waited for the final verdict, Tony was writing random equations out on small bits of paper as he talked to his son. Trying to redirect his own nervous energy as well as Peter\u2019s, to prevent either of them from just running up the stairs. Neither were any good at waiting, and today was no exception, the only thing really keeping them in place was the threat of Bruce\u2019s disappointed glare. \r</p><p>\u201cHopefully soon, Bruce is just going to check on him right now baby boy ok? Remember when I said that Wade was a bit ill? Well, Bruce is just checking to see if he\u2019s better again ok?\u201d\r</p><p>Nodding, Peter continued to poke at his food, despite it being the first warm meal in ages that they got to eat. \u201cI remember Daddy\u201d \r</p><p>The hand not being used to eat, was idly petting Punk\u2019s head that rested on his lap, hoping for any scraps of food that may fall down; despite already having eaten a bowl of food already. Pulling out a chair besides Peter, Steve looks down with a soft smile and ruffles Peter\u2019s hair, messing up further the curled locks. \r</p><p>\u201cWade may not be up to much, but maybe you can show him around the place with someone? Wade hasn\u2019t had a good look around yet I bet, you can show him the massive game room up stairs as well?\u201d \r</p><p>Brightening up instantly, Peter nods enthusiastically shovelling in a mouthful of food finally, much to Tony\u2019s joy. \r</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Steve raises an eyebrow as Peter tries to speak with a full mouth, causing him to giggle and swallow before he attempts talking again. \u201cI can show him the bamboo hut in the garden as well!\u201d  \r</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Grinning, Steve nods at the now more happier child, he catches Tony thanking him from behind Peter\u2018s head. \r</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony stood up to get some more water to drink, rubbing Bucky\u2019s arm as he passes him. \r</p><p>It\u2019s not long till they all hear footsteps coming down the hall, even Loki pauses from cleaning his weapons to see if Bruce brings good news. Excited, Peter drops his cutlery as he scrambles out of his chair and he would have fallen off in his rush had Steve not managed to grab him in time. \r</p><p>\u201cPeter wait! Hang on wiggle butt before you hurt yourself,\u201d Chuckling, Steve gets Peter out of the chair and hands him to Bucky to hold onto him, just in case it\u2019s bad news. Smirking, Bucky effortlessly holds the squirming child and ruffles his hair affectionately, when Peter gives a small whine in protest to being held. \r</p><p>Moving to the front of the kitchen, Steve stands facing the door as it creeks open, Bruce\u2019s head pop\u2019s around the corner first before the rest of him quickly follows. The group in the kitchen moves closer anxiously, all eyes trained on the Doctor as he fiddles with his glasses.\r</p><p>\u201cBruce-\u201c\r</p><p>\u201cIs Wade ok?!\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cuts over everyone else\u2019s as he impatiently strains against Bucky\u2019s arms, his head craning to the side as if that would help him see around the door. Grinning, Bruce pushes the door to make it swing open instead of answering. Stood there in his usually jeans and hoodie was Wade, looking as healthy as he did the day before the bite; not a single hint of any sign that he was liable to turn into a Deado. \r</p><p>\u201cWade!!\u201d Squealing and writhing to be put down, Peter dashes to Wade the moment his little feet made contact with the ground. Peter\u2019s face split wide with a smile of pure joy at finally seeing his friend. Grinning widely, Wade manages to catch the speeding smaller body as it hurtles into him like a tiny torpedo. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Petey, miss me?\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cYeah! Missed you lots, I have so much to show you! There\u2019s this awesome bamboo garden outside that Steve and me found!\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cOoh sounds cool,\u201d Smiling the elder boy hugs Peter hard. All of the adults knew the separation wasn\u2019t easy on both of the kids, having made a fast friendship, they didn\u2019t like to be apart. Tony found it endearing that the two boys had such a strong connection already. It often reminded him of his and Rhodey\u2019s own relationship.\r</p><p>Oh god does Tony miss his best friend, all he could do was hope that both him and Pepper and hopefully Happy as well, where all ok. Surviving and getting by, hopefully travelling together or in a bigger group for safety. Before he could get too focused on his own thoughts, Tony forcibly brings himself back into the present and smiles fondly as the two boys move to the table. Tony snagged a quick hug as the Wade passed, expressing his relief that he was ok.  \r</p><p>Everyone in the room has practically sagged in silent relief at Wade being ok, but it leaves a big question to be answered. How was it he was able to survive? \r</p><p>After Wade had come in, Natasha and Clint silently slipped into the kitchen, Clint making a beeline for the coffee; glad that they had found some on their newest raids. All clean from the newly working showers, everyone looks much better after having been able to finally clean themselves properly again. Quietly, Tony makes his way to Bruce\u2019s side who was sat next to Natasha at the table, leaning his head on her shoulder. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Brucie, rough few days?\u201d Whispering, Tony grins a bit as he nudges his old science buddy. Humming, Bruce glances at Tony before turning his curious gaze onto Wade, the scientist was intrigued as well as baffled by the boy. \r</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. Say Tony, how do you think Wade survived the bite? Not one person before has survived and yet, here is a small kid who has actually beaten it. Simply amazing\u2026\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cI know, damn Bruce, if we had the equipment we could potentially figure out a cure or preventative\u201d Tony pauses as a thought comes to him, \u201cBruce, would the small medical centre in town have blood analysing equipment?\u201d\r</p><p>Frowning, Bruce hums quietly as he thinks it over, accepting a new coffee from Sam as he passes them all new cups. \r</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if they got equipment in the early stages of all this to handle local cases, most local centres where given extra equipment to try and give them a chance to find a cure or at least keep the spread minimum. So if this place managed to get some before it was to late, they would have pretty much all the equipment we would need.\u201d \r</p><p>Sitting up again, Bruce leans back as they whisper so as to not alarm the chattering kids across from them. Steve remains by the kids trying to minimise the mess as Wade eats another plate of food. Bucky had moved to sit in a chair behind the two genius\u2019s, listening intently to them as they brainstormed. The gods remained where they were but were no doubt listening in as well. Sam and Clint where over by the coffee pot chatting quietly to themselves, oblivious to everything else going on around them. \r</p><p>Tapping a finger on his cheek, Tony leans on his left hand as he sips his own drink, contemplating this. \r</p><p>\u201cWe need to make that run into town sooner rather than later then. If any machines are salvageable, we want to be the ones to get them.\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cEither me or you need to go Tony, we are the only ones that know what we are looking for really-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cTony can go, you need to rest after the last few days of watching over Wade. Me and Clint have been up all night so us going would be risky as well.\u201d Natasha cut in, her tone like steel as she levels Bruce a look, she disliked it when Bruce neglected to care for himself at times. However, Tony could see the signs of exhaustion from the nights being up and stressing over Wade and having to be constantly on edge. She and Clint had taken most of the shifts, alternating with Sam and Bruce to minimise the contact between Wade and Peter and the possibility of the virus being carried over. \r</p><p>Before all this, this would have been easy for the ex-black widow, but weeks of being on edge near constantly and sleepless nights from old nightmares as well as new ones, has drained her as it has all of them. Even the super soldiers where often looking worse for wear, whereas before they could of gone strong for days in a row. They all took the chance to rest when they could, not knowing when they would next have that chance. \r</p><p>Nodding in agreement with Natasha, Tony claps a hand onto Bruce\u2019s shoulder and grins, \u201cI will take care of it ok? I\u2019ll to the guys and we will figure out an action plan ok?\u201d \r</p><p>Later on, out in the gardens, Thor sat in the bamboo den with the two kids playing some kind of game. Loki, Bucky and Steve stood nearby listening to Tony explain his and Bruce\u2019s conversation from that morning,  Sam was sat next to Tony on a bench facing the three standing Dom\u2019s. None looked to happy to take Tony out in a potentially deadly situation, but none could dispute Tony\u2019s statement that none of them even remotely knew what to look for. \r</p><p>\u201cMe, Thor, Loki and Bucky will go into town with you. You will stick close to one of us the entire time ok? We don\u2019t know how dangerous the centre will be so we need to be really careful, we can\u2019t loose you nor Bruce as you are our best bets of surviving this.\u201d Crossing his arm over his broad chest, Steve gave Tony his Captain America look. To his right, Bucky had a similar look and stance, only his actually looked a tad more intimidating. \r</p><p>\u201cCross my heart Cap, I\u2019ll be a good boy the entire time, scouts honour.\u201d Smirking up at the Dom, Tony cheekily salutes at him, winking for added measure. \u201cOh and Bruce wants  this if anyone can find it,\u201d smirking Tony hands Steve a piece of paper that has the item Bruce wants scribbled down on. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gives Tony an incredulous look but nods pocketing the bit of paper without another word. \r</p><p>The next morning, Steve, Bucky, Thor, Loki and Tony set out to the town. They had decided to wait till this morning so that they could make use of as much daylight as they could and have more time to prepare for this. Steve even double checked with Bruce about the item he had written down, face blank, Bruce confirmed that yes what he wrote was correct. \r</p><p>\u201cHow do we want to do this, we need to do a general run on the other shops as well so do we hit the medical centre or the town shops first?\u201d Getting out of the truck they took to be able to carry everything they find, leaving the car for the others in-case of an emergency; Steve checked his gear and weapons as he directed his question to the others. \r</p><p>\u201cMedical, it\u2019s more of a priority than the other stores. The medical would have food stocked up for the patients they took in and the workers as well as equipment. As most people would avoid a potential death trap, it would make sense for them to target the smaller local stores.\u201d Tony fiddled with his gauntlet and picked up one of his devices. That is, one of his flashing bombs that flashes when he presses a button and then explodes after a few moments. A way to check inside and to lure away the attention of possible Deado\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t overly powerful either at a small distance but it was enough to damage the Deado\u2019s that get to close. \r</p><p>\u201cI actually agree with Stark for once,\u201d leaning against the truck\u2019s side, Loki twirled a dagger in his hands, idly playing with it; Bucky watching impressed at the skill Loki obviously possessed. Steve was not looking forward to those two trading dagger wielding tips. Pushing against the truck with his hip, Loki stood to his full height and lazily looked around at the building in front of them. They had pulled up across the road from the medical centre, giving themselves more running distance to put between them and any Deado\u2019s that chase them out. \r</p><p>\u201cI believe the best approach would be my self and Stark sneaking in to check the outside, find the best way in-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Steve cut n, growling at Loki, not being able to help his knee jerk reaction to wanting to keep Tony away from danger as best as he can. Huffing with annoyance, Loki sends him a withering glare. \r</p><p>\u201cRogers, may I remind you that we are some of the more faster and sneakier of the group? Yes Barnes is faster than Stark but his arm could reflect the sunlight. Catching the eye of a group of those things. Thor is useless at sneaking and you and him are both bright and large. The best options would be me and Stark and you know it.\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cSteve, it\u2019s ok I can take care of myself,\u201d putting a soothing hand on Steve\u2019s arm, Tony gave him a reassuring grin. \u201cYou know Lo-Lo is right-\u201c\r</p><p>\u201cLo-Lo?!\u201d \r</p><p>\u201c-besides, he won\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d Grinning brightly, happy to ignore the burning glare that was being aimed at him from Loki. \r</p><p>Still not completely convinced, Steve looks over at Bucky. Bucky himself didn\u2019t look to pleased with the plan, but Steve could see that Bucky agreed, even if reluctantly, with this plan. \r</p><p>\u201cOne strand of hair misplaced Loki\u2026\u201d Bucky growled quietly at Loki, a knife was twirled in his hands threateningly. Scoffing, Loki turned his back on them, already walking towards the building causing Tony to hurry after him. \r</p><p>\u201cHe will be returned in pristine condition.\u201d\r</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r</p><p>\u201cHey Steve, do you think at one point Tony had a sex dungeon?\u201d\r</p><p>Blinking in shock, Steve looks over his shoulder at his best friend- where had that random question come from? Since Loki and Tony had left to do the recon, Thor moved to sit in the truck in case they need a quick getaway while Bucky and Steve were stood in the middle of the road, backs together as they keep watch both ways. \r</p><p>\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s all that\u2019s on your mind right now?\u201d Steve asked Bucky Incredulously, peeking over his shoulder at Bucky before turning to face forward again. \r</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah I mean Wade is ok- I mean fuck Steve; Wade is the first to survive a bite from a Deado that we know of! I\u2019m not as smart as Tony or Bruce to properly geek out over it, and we can\u2019t work out the how or why until we get this machine stuff back to the mansion. So my brain is focusing on what I\u2019m good at\u201d smirking, Bucky scanned the streets and buildings, unable to help but feel like they are being watched. But he couldn\u2019t sense anyone, it was unnerving and frustrating for the former Winter Soldier. \r</p><p>\u201cSniping?..\u201d Steve said hopefully, trying to turn the subject away from Tony\u2019s sex history. Just the thought was making his blood rush south, his mind wandering as it imagined what tony would look like. Firmly and with a great show of will, Steve forced those thoughts away for later.\r</p><p>\u201cThat and sex. Hey think we could get Tony to agree to some old fashioned movie troupe like sexy times? Me and you or just me in a tree with a scope? Watching him tease in a window, hell maybe you\u2019re in there with him to tease me. Watching you two get it on while I can only watch-\u201c \r</p><p>\u201cJesus fuck Bucky\u201d coughing uncomfortably, face bright red as images again sprang to his mind, making his body heat up in both arousal and discomfort. \u201cNow isn\u2019t really the time to be talking about things like that jerk.\u201d \r</p><p>Steve huffed when all he got in return was a chuckle from Bucky, that jerk knew exactly how that affected him. Their senses were much sharper than a normal Dom\u2019s, even without the serum though, Bucky would have been able to smell how affected Steve was by his words just now. \r</p><p>Taking deep long calming breathes, Steve managed to get himself back under control just as Loki and Tony came back, walking around the far left of the building, the very same direction that Steve was currently facing. Relief flooded him, as Steve started walking to meet them half way, his eyes moving over Tony critically looking for any signs of injury. \r</p><p>\u201cAs you can see Captain, I have brought him back free of injury. We even found a good way in\u201d smirking, the god of mischief waved his brother over who was still in the car, Bucky had followed Steve once he noticed that Steve had left his post. \r</p><p>\u201cGood, lets get this over with then. How many Deado\u2019 could you see inside from your recon?\u201d \r</p><p>Loki gave them a run down of which rooms in which sections they saw the most Dead, using a stick he drew a rough map in the dirt.\r</p><p>\u201cThis room here, where most of the patients where housed, seems to be full of them. The windows were partially blocked by tables, to prevent outside Dead from looking in I suppose. Most of the rooms were empty but locked up tight, we would have better chances getting into them from the inside. This room here,\u201d Loki points to one part of the map for Steve. \u201cHad some more Dead, mainly staff it appears. The door however is bolted on the inside thankfully, someone must had locked the door before being killed from the inside. On the other hand he room is a research lab room, one with most of the machines Tony and Bruce need\u201d \r</p><p>Impressed with how thorough they had been, Steve nod his thanks before using his foot to scuff the dirt, erasing the map. Steve decided to push the bit of info about the research lab to the back of his mind for now, maybe they will find another room with machines that they could use. If not, they may have to take on that room. \r</p><p>\u201cYou did well, show us the way in and lets get what we need fast, are the patients locked in?\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cNot that we can tell but the door was locked. We thought that maybe the door was blocked or locked from the other side maybe\u201d Tony informs him quietly as the group make their way around the back. \r</p><p>Getting in, as Loki had said, was easy. They found a side door that was unlocked that lead to a kitchen, the kitchen itself was empty as well as the immediate hallway beyond. A quick raid of the kitchen yielded some more food that they took. \r</p><p>Moving fast but quietly they made their way through fast, checking rooms as they go. Many were useless to them apart from the occasional computer or fan in the offices.

                "content": "<p><h1>Walking Avengers 14</h1><p>Urgh the chapter was heavily edited once then little bits changed here and there. Need to make a mental note to not write when tired or distracted by Hobbit: desolation of Smaug. Um for medical stuff and medicines i used what we use in the UK for pain relief. So paracetamol is what we call our main medicine for pain relief tha you can buy in prett much any shop. Anyways I hope you all enjoy! Let me know what you thought!</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p>&ldquo;Daddy, can I see Wade soon?&rdquo; Peter poked at his powered eggs that Sam had found in one of his bags that morning. Peter&rsquo;s appetite wasn&rsquo;t great at the moment, missing Wade has greatly affected it the past few days. \r</p><p>Bruce took up three plates for Natasha, Clint and Wade who were still in the quarantine room. Bruce was going up to do the last (hopefully) check on Wade, to see if he was in the all clear of the virus. If he was, he was going to be able to rejoin the group properly finally again; the group, as a result, were all thrumming with nervous energy. \r</p><p>Steve and Bucky were barely able to contain themselves as they waited for the final verdict, Tony was writing random equations out on small bits of paper as he talked to his son. Trying to redirect his own nervous energy as well as Peter&rsquo;s, to prevent either of them from just running up the stairs. Neither were any good at waiting, and today was no exception, the only thing really keeping them in place was the threat of Bruce&rsquo;s disappointed glare. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Hopefully soon, Bruce is just going to check on him right now baby boy ok? Remember when I said that Wade was a bit ill? Well, Bruce is just checking to see if he&rsquo;s better again ok?&rdquo;\r</p><p>Nodding, Peter continued to poke at his food, despite it being the first warm meal in ages that they got to eat. &ldquo;I remember Daddy&rdquo; \r</p><p>The hand not being used to eat, was idly petting Punk&rsquo;s head that rested on his lap, hoping for any scraps of food that may fall down; despite already having eaten a bowl of food already. Pulling out a chair besides Peter, Steve looks down with a soft smile and ruffles Peter&rsquo;s hair, messing up further the curled locks. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Wade may not be up to much, but maybe you can show him around the place with someone? Wade hasn&rsquo;t had a good look around yet I bet, you can show him the massive game room up stairs as well?&rdquo; \r</p><p>Brightening up instantly, Peter nods enthusiastically shovelling in a mouthful of food finally, much to Tony&rsquo;s joy. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Steve raises an eyebrow as Peter tries to speak with a full mouth, causing him to giggle and swallow before he attempts talking again. &ldquo;I can show him the bamboo hut in the garden as well!&rdquo;  \r</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Grinning, Steve nods at the now more happier child, he catches Tony thanking him from behind Peter&lsquo;s head. \r</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tony stood up to get some more water to drink, rubbing Bucky&rsquo;s arm as he passes him. \r</p><p>It&rsquo;s not long till they all hear footsteps coming down the hall, even Loki pauses from cleaning his weapons to see if Bruce brings good news. Excited, Peter drops his cutlery as he scrambles out of his chair and he would have fallen off in his rush had Steve not managed to grab him in time. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Peter wait! Hang on wiggle butt before you hurt yourself,&rdquo; Chuckling, Steve gets Peter out of the chair and hands him to Bucky to hold onto him, just in case it&rsquo;s bad news. Smirking, Bucky effortlessly holds the squirming child and ruffles his hair affectionately, when Peter gives a small whine in protest to being held. \r</p><p>Moving to the front of the kitchen, Steve stands facing the door as it creeks open, Bruce&rsquo;s head pop&rsquo;s around the corner first before the rest of him quickly follows. The group in the kitchen moves closer anxiously, all eyes trained on the Doctor as he fiddles with his glasses.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce-&ldquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;Is Wade ok?!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice cuts over everyone else&rsquo;s as he impatiently strains against Bucky&rsquo;s arms, his head craning to the side as if that would help him see around the door. Grinning, Bruce pushes the door to make it swing open instead of answering. Stood there in his usually jeans and hoodie was Wade, looking as healthy as he did the day before the bite; not a single hint of any sign that he was liable to turn into a Deado. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Wade!!&rdquo; Squealing and writhing to be put down, Peter dashes to Wade the moment his little feet made contact with the ground. Peter&rsquo;s face split wide with a smile of pure joy at finally seeing his friend. Grinning widely, Wade manages to catch the speeding smaller body as it hurtles into him like a tiny torpedo. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Petey, miss me?&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! Missed you lots, I have so much to show you! There&rsquo;s this awesome bamboo garden outside that Steve and me found!&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh sounds cool,&rdquo; Smiling the elder boy hugs Peter hard. All of the adults knew the separation wasn&rsquo;t easy on both of the kids, having made a fast friendship, they didn&rsquo;t like to be apart. Tony found it endearing that the two boys had such a strong connection already. It often reminded him of his and Rhodey&rsquo;s own relationship.\r</p><p>Oh god does Tony miss his best friend, all he could do was hope that both him and Pepper and hopefully Happy as well, where all ok. Surviving and getting by, hopefully travelling together or in a bigger group for safety. Before he could get too focused on his own thoughts, Tony forcibly brings himself back into the present and smiles fondly as the two boys move to the table. Tony snagged a quick hug as the Wade passed, expressing his relief that he was ok.  \r</p><p>Everyone in the room has practically sagged in silent relief at Wade being ok, but it leaves a big question to be answered. How was it he was able to survive? \r</p><p>After Wade had come in, Natasha and Clint silently slipped into the kitchen, Clint making a beeline for the coffee; glad that they had found some on their newest raids. All clean from the newly working showers, everyone looks much better after having been able to finally clean themselves properly again. Quietly, Tony makes his way to Bruce&rsquo;s side who was sat next to Natasha at the table, leaning his head on her shoulder. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Brucie, rough few days?&rdquo; Whispering, Tony grins a bit as he nudges his old science buddy. Humming, Bruce glances at Tony before turning his curious gaze onto Wade, the scientist was intrigued as well as baffled by the boy. \r</p><p>&ldquo;You could say that. Say Tony, how do you think Wade survived the bite? Not one person before has survived and yet, here is a small kid who has actually beaten it. Simply amazing&hellip;&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;I know, damn Bruce, if we had the equipment we could potentially figure out a cure or preventative&rdquo; Tony pauses as a thought comes to him, &ldquo;Bruce, would the small medical centre in town have blood analysing equipment?&rdquo;\r</p><p>Frowning, Bruce hums quietly as he thinks it over, accepting a new coffee from Sam as he passes them all new cups. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps if they got equipment in the early stages of all this to handle local cases, most local centres where given extra equipment to try and give them a chance to find a cure or at least keep the spread minimum. So if this place managed to get some before it was to late, they would have pretty much all the equipment we would need.&rdquo; \r</p><p>Sitting up again, Bruce leans back as they whisper so as to not alarm the chattering kids across from them. Steve remains by the kids trying to minimise the mess as Wade eats another plate of food. Bucky had moved to sit in a chair behind the two genius&rsquo;s, listening intently to them as they brainstormed. The gods remained where they were but were no doubt listening in as well. Sam and Clint where over by the coffee pot chatting quietly to themselves, oblivious to everything else going on around them. \r</p><p>Tapping a finger on his cheek, Tony leans on his left hand as he sips his own drink, contemplating this. \r</p><p>&ldquo;We need to make that run into town sooner rather than later then. If any machines are salvageable, we want to be the ones to get them.&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Either me or you need to go Tony, we are the only ones that know what we are looking for really-&ldquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Tony can go, you need to rest after the last few days of watching over Wade. Me and Clint have been up all night so us going would be risky as well.&rdquo; Natasha cut in, her tone like steel as she levels Bruce a look, she disliked it when Bruce neglected to care for himself at times. However, Tony could see the signs of exhaustion from the nights being up and stressing over Wade and having to be constantly on edge. She and Clint had taken most of the shifts, alternating with Sam and Bruce to minimise the contact between Wade and Peter and the possibility of the virus being carried over. \r</p><p>Before all this, this would have been easy for the ex-black widow, but weeks of being on edge near constantly and sleepless nights from old nightmares as well as new ones, has drained her as it has all of them. Even the super soldiers where often looking worse for wear, whereas before they could of gone strong for days in a row. They all took the chance to rest when they could, not knowing when they would next have that chance. \r</p><p>Nodding in agreement with Natasha, Tony claps a hand onto Bruce&rsquo;s shoulder and grins, &ldquo;I will take care of it ok? I&rsquo;ll to the guys and we will figure out an action plan ok?&rdquo; \r</p><p>Later on, out in the gardens, Thor sat in the bamboo den with the two kids playing some kind of game. Loki, Bucky and Steve stood nearby listening to Tony explain his and Bruce&rsquo;s conversation from that morning,  Sam was sat next to Tony on a bench facing the three standing Dom&rsquo;s. None looked to happy to take Tony out in a potentially deadly situation, but none could dispute Tony&rsquo;s statement that none of them even remotely knew what to look for. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Me, Thor, Loki and Bucky will go into town with you. You will stick close to one of us the entire time ok? We don&rsquo;t know how dangerous the centre will be so we need to be really careful, we can&rsquo;t loose you nor Bruce as you are our best bets of surviving this.&rdquo; Crossing his arm over his broad chest, Steve gave Tony his Captain America look. To his right, Bucky had a similar look and stance, only his actually looked a tad more intimidating. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Cross my heart Cap, I&rsquo;ll be a good boy the entire time, scouts honour.&rdquo; Smirking up at the Dom, Tony cheekily salutes at him, winking for added measure. &ldquo;Oh and Bruce wants  this if anyone can find it,&rdquo; smirking Tony hands Steve a piece of paper that has the item Bruce wants scribbled down on. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gives Tony an incredulous look but nods pocketing the bit of paper without another word. \r</p><p>The next morning, Steve, Bucky, Thor, Loki and Tony set out to the town. They had decided to wait till this morning so that they could make use of as much daylight as they could and have more time to prepare for this. Steve even double checked with Bruce about the item he had written down, face blank, Bruce confirmed that yes what he wrote was correct. \r</p><p>&ldquo;How do we want to do this, we need to do a general run on the other shops as well so do we hit the medical centre or the town shops first?&rdquo; Getting out of the truck they took to be able to carry everything they find, leaving the car for the others in-case of an emergency; Steve checked his gear and weapons as he directed his question to the others. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Medical, it&rsquo;s more of a priority than the other stores. The medical would have food stocked up for the patients they took in and the workers as well as equipment. As most people would avoid a potential death trap, it would make sense for them to target the smaller local stores.&rdquo; Tony fiddled with his gauntlet and picked up one of his devices. That is, one of his flashing bombs that flashes when he presses a button and then explodes after a few moments. A way to check inside and to lure away the attention of possible Deado&rsquo;s, it wasn&rsquo;t overly powerful either at a small distance but it was enough to damage the Deado&rsquo;s that get to close. \r</p><p>&ldquo;I actually agree with Stark for once,&rdquo; leaning against the truck&rsquo;s side, Loki twirled a dagger in his hands, idly playing with it; Bucky watching impressed at the skill Loki obviously possessed. Steve was not looking forward to those two trading dagger wielding tips. Pushing against the truck with his hip, Loki stood to his full height and lazily looked around at the building in front of them. They had pulled up across the road from the medical centre, giving themselves more running distance to put between them and any Deado&rsquo;s that chase them out. \r</p><p>&ldquo;I believe the best approach would be my self and Stark sneaking in to check the outside, find the best way in-&ldquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Steve cut n, growling at Loki, not being able to help his knee jerk reaction to wanting to keep Tony away from danger as best as he can. Huffing with annoyance, Loki sends him a withering glare. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Rogers, may I remind you that we are some of the more faster and sneakier of the group? Yes Barnes is faster than Stark but his arm could reflect the sunlight. Catching the eye of a group of those things. Thor is useless at sneaking and you and him are both bright and large. The best options would be me and Stark and you know it.&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Steve, it&rsquo;s ok I can take care of myself,&rdquo; putting a soothing hand on Steve&rsquo;s arm, Tony gave him a reassuring grin. &ldquo;You know Lo-Lo is right-&ldquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;Lo-Lo?!&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;-besides, he won&rsquo;t let anything happen to me.&rdquo; Grinning brightly, happy to ignore the burning glare that was being aimed at him from Loki. \r</p><p>Still not completely convinced, Steve looks over at Bucky. Bucky himself didn&rsquo;t look to pleased with the plan, but Steve could see that Bucky agreed, even if reluctantly, with this plan. \r</p><p>&ldquo;One strand of hair misplaced Loki&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky growled quietly at Loki, a knife was twirled in his hands threateningly. Scoffing, Loki turned his back on them, already walking towards the building causing Tony to hurry after him. \r</p><p>&ldquo;He will be returned in pristine condition.&rdquo;\r</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\r</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Steve, do you think at one point Tony had a sex dungeon?&rdquo;\r</p><p>Blinking in shock, Steve looks over his shoulder at his best friend- where had that random question come from? Since Loki and Tony had left to do the recon, Thor moved to sit in the truck in case they need a quick getaway while Bucky and Steve were stood in the middle of the road, backs together as they keep watch both ways. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously? That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s on your mind right now?&rdquo; Steve asked Bucky Incredulously, peeking over his shoulder at Bucky before turning to face forward again. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yeah I mean Wade is ok- I mean fuck Steve; Wade is the first to survive a bite from a Deado that we know of! I&rsquo;m not as smart as Tony or Bruce to properly geek out over it, and we can&rsquo;t work out the how or why until we get this machine stuff back to the mansion. So my brain is focusing on what I&rsquo;m good at&rdquo; smirking, Bucky scanned the streets and buildings, unable to help but feel like they are being watched. But he couldn&rsquo;t sense anyone, it was unnerving and frustrating for the former Winter Soldier. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Sniping?..&rdquo; Steve said hopefully, trying to turn the subject away from Tony&rsquo;s sex history. Just the thought was making his blood rush south, his mind wandering as it imagined what tony would look like. Firmly and with a great show of will, Steve forced those thoughts away for later.\r</p><p>&ldquo;That and sex. Hey think we could get Tony to agree to some old fashioned movie troupe like sexy times? Me and you or just me in a tree with a scope? Watching him tease in a window, hell maybe you&rsquo;re in there with him to tease me. Watching you two get it on while I can only watch-&ldquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus fuck Bucky&rdquo; coughing uncomfortably, face bright red as images again sprang to his mind, making his body heat up in both arousal and discomfort. &ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t really the time to be talking about things like that jerk.&rdquo; \r</p><p>Steve huffed when all he got in return was a chuckle from Bucky, that jerk knew exactly how that affected him. Their senses were much sharper than a normal Dom&rsquo;s, even without the serum though, Bucky would have been able to smell how affected Steve was by his words just now. \r</p><p>Taking deep long calming breathes, Steve managed to get himself back under control just as Loki and Tony came back, walking around the far left of the building, the very same direction that Steve was currently facing. Relief flooded him, as Steve started walking to meet them half way, his eyes moving over Tony critically looking for any signs of injury. \r</p><p>&ldquo;As you can see Captain, I have brought him back free of injury. We even found a good way in&rdquo; smirking, the god of mischief waved his brother over who was still in the car, Bucky had followed Steve once he noticed that Steve had left his post. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Good, lets get this over with then. How many Deado&rsquo; could you see inside from your recon?&rdquo; \r</p><p>Loki gave them a run down of which rooms in which sections they saw the most Dead, using a stick he drew a rough map in the dirt.\r</p><p>&ldquo;This room here, where most of the patients where housed, seems to be full of them. The windows were partially blocked by tables, to prevent outside Dead from looking in I suppose. Most of the rooms were empty but locked up tight, we would have better chances getting into them from the inside. This room here,&rdquo; Loki points to one part of the map for Steve. &ldquo;Had some more Dead, mainly staff it appears. The door however is bolted on the inside thankfully, someone must had locked the door before being killed from the inside. On the other hand he room is a research lab room, one with most of the machines Tony and Bruce need&rdquo; \r</p><p>Impressed with how thorough they had been, Steve nod his thanks before using his foot to scuff the dirt, erasing the map. Steve decided to push the bit of info about the research lab to the back of his mind for now, maybe they will find another room with machines that they could use. If not, they may have to take on that room. \r</p><p>&ldquo;You did well, show us the way in and lets get what we need fast, are the patients locked in?&rdquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;Not that we can tell but the door was locked. We thought that maybe the door was blocked or locked from the other side maybe&rdquo; Tony informs him quietly as the group make their way around the back. \r</p><p>Getting in, as Loki had said, was easy. They found a side door that was unlocked that lead to a kitchen, the kitchen itself was empty as well as the immediate hallway beyond. A quick raid of the kitchen yielded some more food that they took. \r</p><p>Moving fast but quietly they made their way through fast, checking rooms as they go. Many were useless to them apart from the occasional computer or fan in the offices. They decided to come back for those once they were sure they could carry them without threat of being mauled alive. \r</p><p>Occasionally they came across a Deado or two; staff members that had been locked out of the room where the rest where; but were able to swiftly dispatch them before they could make much sound, alerting others of the alive humans nearby. \r</p><p>True to Tony&rsquo;s and Loki&rsquo;s predictions, the room with all the patients in was locked and barred from the outside. The staff had obviously attempted to isolate a situation that was beyond their help and tried to prevent it spreading. Grateful for this mercy, the group moved on and soon found a storage room, boxes and boxes of medication and equipment lined the room and shelves.  \r</p><p>&ldquo;Loki and Thor- take that end and sort through what&rsquo;s useful or what wont be, basically take anything that isn&rsquo;t perishable or is machinery&rdquo; gives them a copy of the list Bruce gave them, including that certain item that Steve still has no idea what it is. &ldquo;Here is a list, make these priority if you can&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Aye Captain.&rdquo; \r</p><p>Each team moved to their end of the room, spreading out to check through the boxes for anything of use. Tony gave a little uttered cheers when he finds something particularly useful, a pile near the doorway rapidly forming. \r</p><p>Shifting through a box, Bucky cleared out anything perished or useless, the next box was filled with medicine for all sorts of ailments and conditions. Many names jumped out at Bucky, more than half he had no hope in properly pronouncing but some he recognised. The ones he did he placed in his backpack along with a few boxes from the list. Just as Bucky was about to move the rest of the box to a pile to take but not priority, he spots a certain name. One that Steve had shown him and looked at many times in confusion since Bruce had given it to him. \r</p><p>N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanamide. \r</p><p>Bucky grinned when he saw the chemical name of the medicine, however the grin fell when he saw it&rsquo;s common name above.
