Over her years at Hogwarts she collects her Hoard&hellip;<br />(basically an excuse to write Dragon!Harry. fight me i actually like this one. its been here through purge after purge but progress is slow)</b><br />HeartBeats- You would think, in his time, that Voldemort would have learnt that there is very little a guardian won&rsquo;t do for their charge when they truly care. So why, did Voldemort continue to go after Harry Potter when he attended 6th year with two children in tow? Simple. He was a fucking Idiot. (Basically Harry adopts two girls and makes a deal with Voldemort to keep them safe. the result&hellip; well, it works out for the both of them)<br /><b>How to Bullshit the System (fake title until i work something out).- Harry Potter was a perfectly normal colledge student. thank you very much. until he was thrown into his 11 year old body and shipped off to magical school. <br />honestly, if he ever got back to his world. he was going to fucking kill Tom Riddle for writing those rediculous books. as is&hellip; well, he&rsquo;d have to settle for fucking over 'Lord Voldemort&rsquo;.<br />Projec; Atlantis- Harry Potter disappeared from the world 17 years ago&hellip; in hindsight. hiding by working for the Dark Lord using a new look and name was definity going to bite him in the arse sooner or later. honestly he&rsquo;s surprised it took this long.</b><br />Winging it- Harry Potter runs away from the wizarding world using his anamigus form and ends up at Malfoy Manor. what follows is&hellip; well, lets just say he&rsquo;s winging the situation. because he has long since lost control of this train.Potterverse/MCU<br /><b>Dark is all i see- Harry Potter didn&rsquo;t know why or how he ended up as he did. but with a little devil on his shoulder, superpower and magic. who would ever expect him to turn out like a normal teenager? honestly Dumbledore is lucky he didn&rsquo;t end up a merenary. and really. Voldemort can fuck off. he has bigger things to fry then Dark Lords trying to take over a school&hellip;</b><br />Glitter and Gold- Diana Potter deveolped an Obscurial at age 5 and Petunia Dursley moved both her and Dudley out of Vernon&rsquo;s house at age 7. getting an in with the avangers at 14 was luck. getting captured by Voldemort a few days before Thanos fucked over the universe was&hellip; annoying.Potterverse/CWDC universe<br />How to steal a Dark Lord- Wrong-boy-who-lived! Lily raises Harry in france with Leonard Snart. coming back to Britain for the triwizard tornument no ones sure what to think of the Hadrian Snart&hellip; a boy who looks rimarkably like Richard Potter. least of all Tom Riddle.<br />Meta Magic- Harry Potter ends up in the CWDCU. this idea isn&rsquo;t 100% fleshed out. will see where it goes.there&rsquo;s more but&hellip; they dont have to do with Harry Potter. and im not sure where they&rsquo;re going to be honest so i think i&rsquo;ll leave this post here. any of the bolded stories are ones that have made good (aka any) progress in the last month.<br /></p>",

She spent most of her life denying the romantic overtones sewn into her fiction, but awoke one more and realized every single tales she'd spun somehow revolved around the heart. She has since given into the whim, spinning yarns woven from heartstrings.\n\nJennifer is an avid gamer in  her spare time, and has written a vast number of fanfiction in the Elder Scrolls, Witcher and Dragon Age universes under the pseudonym Erica North (http://ericanorth.net).\n\nShe currently resides in Northeast Pennsylvania with her husband, daughter and a houseful of dragons she must train regularly to keep them from setting fire to the curtains. Nightly she dreams she is laying on the beach watching stars burst over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTo learn more visit her official website: http://jennifermelzer.com",
