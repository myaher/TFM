He paused his show, trying to not get the orange dust on his phone, and opened the messages app.</p><p><b>basketball guy</b>: heybfjdome overb</p><p><b>basketball guy</b>: coemn ocef</p><p><b>basketball guy</b>: cone ovet </p><p>Cyrus furrowed his eyebrows, and replied:</p><p><b>underdog</b>: tj, are you alright?</p><p><b>basketball guy</b>: yesg i\u2019m ppercefktk fien </p><p><b>basketball guy</b>: peerfely finr</p><p><b>basketball guy</b>: i csnr see</p><p>Cyrus, worried, immediately wiped the cheez puff dust off his face, straightened out his hair, and ran down the stairs, announcing to his mom where he was going.</p><p>When Cyrus arrived at TJ\u2019s house, he rang the doorbell, and TJ\u2019s mom answered the door. Cyrus asked urgently, \u201cIs TJ okay? He texted me to come over but he was making lots of typos and he said he couldn\u2019t se\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Cyrus. He just got his wisdom teeth out,\u201d the blonde woman replied, smiling. Cyrus took a breath as she added, \u201cI\u2019m actually kind of happy you\u2019re here, I have to run some errands but I didn\u2019t want to leave him alone. Are you okay with taking care of him for a bit?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled wide. \u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out of the doorway to allow Cyrus in, saying, \u201cGreat. He\u2019s lying on the couch.\u201d Cyrus gave her a thumbs up while she grabbed her things to leave. \u201cI should be back in ten minutes, text me if you need anything, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Cyrus replied.</p><p>As TJ\u2019s mom left, Cyrus made his way from the entry way to the living room to see TJ lying on the couch just as his mom said, wearing the sweatshirt from Cyrus\u2019 bash mitzvah.</p><p>Cyrus immediately flushed red at the sight, while TJ, noticing him walk in, slurred, \u201cHeeeey, underdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Teej.\u201d Cyrus cleared his throat, trying to get over the fact that his crush was wearing a sweatshirt with his face on it. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>TJ, who looked like he could pass out at any second, mumbled, \u201cGreat, now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, his face only growing more and more red. TJ continued, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re like, my faaavorite person, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of my favorite people, too, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied, wearing a smile on his face that was impossible to wipe off.</p><p>\u201c\u2018S why I\u2019m wearin\u2019 this sweatshirt, because it\u2019s got your face on it,\u201d TJ added, mimicking an explosion with his mouth at the end. \u201cThat was like, a really good idea. You\u2019re so smart, muffin boyyyy.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted, almost in disbelief of how adorable TJ was being, and of how much TJ was complimenting him. He tried to remind himself that TJ was just incredibly high on meds at the moment. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>TJ flung his arms behind his head so they were dangling off the arm of the couch as he continued to talk, almost unaware that Cyrus was actually paying attention to what he was saying. \u201cYou\u2019re smaaart, and you\u2019re cuuute, and you\u2019re funny, you\u2019re like&hellip;. perfect. Perfect little muffin boy.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt like he was about to explode. Even though TJ was basically delirious, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but get all giddy over him and the fact that he was complimenting him over and over. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say per\u2014\u201c</p><p>TJ almost inaudibly mumbled, interrupting Cyrus, \u201cPerfect little muffin crush.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus refused to believe he heard TJ correctly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, almost laughing.</p><p>And of course, TJ had fallen asleep seconds prior. \u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus repeated in a whisper, more to himself than anyone else.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t see or talk to TJ until the following Monday. He kept convincing himself that none of what TJ was saying on that Saturday was actually coherent or true, that TJ didn\u2019t actually feel that way about him, he was just hopped up on meds, and there was no way that Big Hetero TJ Kippen could ever like him in the way that he did.</p><p>He tried pushing all of what happened out of his mind, at least until TJ approached him on that fated Monday morning. \u201cHey, Underdog! My mom told me you\u2019d looked after me for a little bit on Saturday, just wanted to say thank you,\u201d TJ said, a grin unwavering on his face.</p><p>Cyrus presses his lips into a flat line, trying to resemble a smile, and replied, \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>TJ added more quietly, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything&hellip; weird, did I?\u201d</p><p>And this is when Cyrus found himself in between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, he wanted to tell TJ that he said he had a crush on him because he hated lying, but that could only lead to crushing disappointment since TJ would just confirm that he was super drugged out. On the other hand, he could lie to TJ to save his sanity, but he knew he\u2019d go insane anyway because it would kill him to lie to TJ. So, Cyrus went with, \u201cWell, you did say that you had a crush on me, but I\u2019m sure that was just\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d TJ whispered.</p><p>Cyrus furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-nothing,\u201d TJ responded, looking like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>Cyrus softened his expression a bit, disbelief twinging his eyes. \u201cDo you? Have a crush on me?\u201d</p><p>TJ winced, rambling, \u201cI mean, yeah, but I completely understand if you don\u2019t feel the same way because why would you, I\u2019m just some dumb jock who screws up all the time, but I\u2019d really like to at least stay friends with you because you\u2019re just\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cA perfect little muffin boy?\u201d Cyrus interrupted, amusement present in his tone.</p><p>TJ grimaced, \u201cIs that what I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time,\u201d Cyrus chuckled.</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened as he rambled again, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know what that means. Look, Cyrus, I\u2019m so sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable at all, I never intended for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you done rambling for no reason yet?\u201d Cyrus interrupted yet again, a smile on his face this time.</p><p>TJ grew confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nudged him on the shoulder, \u201cI like you too, you dork.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes almost popped out of his head. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed lightly. \u201cYeah, really. You\u2019re a perfect little basketball guy.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed, rolling his eyes. \u201cSo&hellip; what does that make us now?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged hopefully, \u201cBoyfriends?\u201d</p><p>TJ flashed him a special grin. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>",

Cyrus asked urgently, \u201cIs TJ okay? He texted me to come over but he was making lots of typos and he said he couldn\u2019t se\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Cyrus. He just got his wisdom teeth out,\u201d the blonde woman replied, smiling. Cyrus took a breath as she added, \u201cI\u2019m actually kind of happy you\u2019re here, I have to run some errands but I didn\u2019t want to leave him alone. Are you okay with taking care of him for a bit?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled wide. \u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out of the doorway to allow Cyrus in, saying, \u201cGreat. He\u2019s lying on the couch.\u201d Cyrus gave her a thumbs up while she grabbed her things to leave. \u201cI should be back in ten minutes, text me if you need anything, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Cyrus replied.</p><p>As TJ\u2019s mom left, Cyrus made his way from the entry way to the living room to see TJ lying on the couch just as his mom said, wearing the sweatshirt from Cyrus\u2019 bash mitzvah.</p><p>Cyrus immediately flushed red at the sight, while TJ, noticing him walk in, slurred, \u201cHeeeey, underdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Teej.\u201d Cyrus cleared his throat, trying to get over the fact that his crush was wearing a sweatshirt with his face on it. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>TJ, who looked like he could pass out at any second, mumbled, \u201cGreat, now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, his face only growing more and more red. TJ continued, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re like, my faaavorite person, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of my favorite people, too, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied, wearing a smile on his face that was impossible to wipe off.</p><p>\u201c\u2018S why I\u2019m wearin\u2019 this sweatshirt, because it\u2019s got your face on it,\u201d TJ added, mimicking an explosion with his mouth at the end. \u201cThat was like, a really good idea. You\u2019re so smart, muffin boyyyy.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted, almost in disbelief of how adorable TJ was being, and of how much TJ was complimenting him. He tried to remind himself that TJ was just incredibly high on meds at the moment. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>TJ flung his arms behind his head so they were dangling off the arm of the couch as he continued to talk, almost unaware that Cyrus was actually paying attention to what he was saying. \u201cYou\u2019re smaaart, and you\u2019re cuuute, and you\u2019re funny, you\u2019re like\u2026. perfect. Perfect little muffin boy.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt like he was about to explode. Even though TJ was basically delirious, Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but get all giddy over him and the fact that he was complimenting him over and over. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say per\u2014\u201c</p><p>TJ almost inaudibly mumbled, interrupting Cyrus, \u201cPerfect little muffin crush.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus refused to believe he heard TJ correctly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, almost laughing.</p><p>And of course, TJ had fallen asleep seconds prior. \u201cWhat?\u201d Cyrus repeated in a whisper, more to himself than anyone else.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t see or talk to TJ until the following Monday. He kept convincing himself that none of what TJ was saying on that Saturday was actually coherent or true, that TJ didn\u2019t actually feel that way about him, he was just hopped up on meds, and there was no way that Big Hetero TJ Kippen could ever like him in the way that he did.</p><p>He tried pushing all of what happened out of his mind, at least until TJ approached him on that fated Monday morning. \u201cHey, Underdog! My mom told me you\u2019d looked after me for a little bit on Saturday, just wanted to say thank you,\u201d TJ said, a grin unwavering on his face.</p><p>Cyrus presses his lips into a flat line, trying to resemble a smile, and replied, \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>TJ added more quietly, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything\u2026 weird, did I?\u201d</p><p>And this is when Cyrus found himself in between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, he wanted to tell TJ that he said he had a crush on him because he hated lying, but that could only lead to crushing disappointment since TJ would just confirm that he was super drugged out. On the other hand, he could lie to TJ to save his sanity, but he knew he\u2019d go insane anyway because it would kill him to lie to TJ. So, Cyrus went with, \u201cWell, you did say that you had a crush on me, but I\u2019m sure that was just\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d TJ whispered.</p><p>Cyrus furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-nothing,\u201d TJ responded, looking like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>Cyrus softened his expression a bit, disbelief twinging his eyes. \u201cDo you? Have a crush on me?\u201d</p><p>TJ winced, rambling, \u201cI mean, yeah, but I completely understand if you don\u2019t feel the same way because why would you, I\u2019m just some dumb jock who screws up all the time, but I\u2019d really like to at least stay friends with you because you\u2019re just\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cA perfect little muffin boy?\u201d Cyrus interrupted, amusement present in his tone.</p><p>TJ grimaced, \u201cIs that what I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time,\u201d Cyrus chuckled.</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes widened as he rambled again, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know what that means. Look, Cyrus, I\u2019m so sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable at all, I never intended for\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you done rambling for no reason yet?\u201d Cyrus interrupted yet again, a smile on his face this time.</p><p>TJ grew confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nudged him on the shoulder, \u201cI like you too, you dork.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyes almost popped out of his head. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed lightly. \u201cYeah, really. You\u2019re a perfect little basketball guy.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed, rolling his eyes. \u201cSo\u2026 what does that make us now?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged hopefully, \u201cBoyfriends?\u201d</p><p>TJ flashed him a special grin. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p></p>",
