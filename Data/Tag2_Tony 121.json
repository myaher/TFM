He figured Tony would sit the kid down and coax him into spilling like the responsible parent he was slowly morphing into. Instead, Tony watched Peter for a moment as if analyzing him, then he ran forward in a crouch like a rugby player, scooped the kid into his arms, and <i>chucked </i>him onto the couch cushions.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter landed with a muffled&nbsp;&ldquo;oomph,&rdquo; his limbs flying everywhere. There was a beat of stillness where Rhodey&rsquo;s jaw dropped and Peter blinked in shock.</p><p>Then the kid threw back his head and laughed.</p><p>That was apparently what Tony was waiting for, because he darted forward and pinned Peter to the couch, half-sitting, half-laying on him to hold him still.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What the&ndash;&rdquo; Peter giggled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Tony said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, get off.&rdquo; He struggled against Tony&rsquo;s hold, but Rhodey knew it was only for show. The kid could throw Tony across the room without even trying if he really wanted to.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo; Tony was grinning, and even though it made the crows feet at the corners of his eyes more pronounced, he looked younger than he had in years.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crushing me,&rdquo; Peter wheezed dramatically.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I resent the implication&ndash;&rdquo; Tony caught both of Peter&rsquo;s wrists in one hand so he&rsquo;d stop halfheartedly pushing at Tony&rsquo;s chest&nbsp;&ldquo;&ndash;that I am heavier than a <i>building</i>.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s groan was lost amid his laughter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Tony said, poking Peter in the side and making him squirm.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me, tell me, tell me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gah.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Rhodey wasn&rsquo;t even trying to hide how big he was smiling at this point, they were both totally oblivious to him anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tickle you til you tell me,&rdquo; Tony threatened.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I could just throw you off,&rdquo; Peter reminded him. His smile broadened. &ldquo;But you might break a hip.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, for that you get a wet willie.&rdquo; Tony raised a finger to his mouth and licked it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, that&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo; Peter protested, writhing more vigorously.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oscorp offered me a job!&rdquo; Peter finally admitted, desperate to avoid such a juvenile punishment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony froze, seemingly so shocked he forgot to release the kid&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked up at Tony, his face torn.&nbsp;&ldquo;An&hellip; an internship. In their biochemistry lab.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony finally sat back, letting Peter sit up. He was biting his lip.&nbsp;&ldquo;But&hellip; you already have an internship. Here.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I mean&hellip; not really. That&rsquo;s just what we tell people.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scoffed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Kid, what do you think all that time in the lab is? It&rsquo;s better experience than cleaning Osborn&rsquo;s petri dishes, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter fiddled with his phone.&nbsp;&ldquo;College applications are coming up. It&rsquo;d look really good.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony finally looked at Rhodey, as if remembering he was in the room for the first time. He looked a little heartbroken.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you&hellip; I mean, if you&rsquo;d rather work there, Pete, I won&rsquo;t&hellip; I won&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed, looking up Tony.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just&hellip; they said they could write me a really nice letter of recommendation so I can get a good scholarship.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony held up his hands in a time out sign.&nbsp;&ldquo;Woah, woah, woah. A letter of recommendation? Peter, I&rsquo;ve had a letter of recommendation written up for you since, like, the day you stopped Vulture. I update it monthly, since you never stop blowing my mind. And as for scholarships, you know I&rsquo;m paying for you. Where is all this coming from?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squirmed again, this time under the weight of Tony&rsquo;s stare. Rhodey was trying to make himself as invisible as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just thought you might&hellip; change your mind or something,&rdquo; Peter muttered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony looked horribly sad for a second, but he seemed to shake it off. He reached up and pushed Peter&rsquo;s bangs back so he could drop a quick kiss on his forehead.&nbsp;&ldquo;Someday, kid, you&rsquo;re going to stop doubting how much you mean to me.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a long moment where Peter and Tony just looked at each other, and whatever was passed between them made the heaviness in the room suddenly ease. Peter slumped into Tony&rsquo;s side without preamble.</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot believe you were going to give me a wet willie. That&rsquo;s so immature, Mr. Stark.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Would you have gone to work for Oscorp if I did?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Peter lied. Tony just chuckled again, looking up and meeting Rhodey&rsquo;s eyes as if to say&nbsp;&lsquo;this kid, am I right?&rsquo; Rhodey just shrugged, smiling. He thought they were a perfect pair, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to tell Tony that.<br /></p>",
