His gaze traced from the bow of Phil&rsquo;s lips to the slopes of his nose to the morning light fanning across Phil&rsquo;s cheekbones. Dan let his fingers leave the warmth of the duvet and brush away some of the black fringe that had fallen over Phil&rsquo;s face overnight.</p><!-- more --><p>Phil had been in Manchester all week for some time with Dan and to tie up some other loose ends that he would be leaving behind with a move to London. Last night had been the last one that Phil would be spending in Manchester for a while, and they had both wanted to spend the time together. Even regarding the fact that Phil had already signed the lease off his Manchester flat and didn&rsquo;t have a place to stay, it had been an easy decision for Phil to spend the night at Dan&rsquo;s. And after an already wonderful day and night together, Dan was more than happy to keep Phil in his grasp a little longer. </p><p>But he couldn&rsquo;t keep Phil forever. </p><p>Phil had a train to catch at about noon, and it was close to nine in the morning already. The train would take him to London, where he would be living from now on. The thought of saying goodbye to Phil without the assurance that he would be returning after a few days was daunting, and even though Dan wanted to be as supportive as possible, he just wanted to stay in bed with Phil forever. \u00a0</p><p>Who needed to work? They could both just lie here in their little bubble and forget the world. </p><p>Dan moved closer to Phil&rsquo;s still-sleeping form and tucked himself under Phil&rsquo;s chin. He closed his eyes once he was settled and let his body sink against Phil&rsquo;s. After a life of shutting people out and being shut out, Dan still reveled in how good it felt to be vulnerable in the presence and care of someone gentle and trustworthy. </p><p>Barely-there fingers running through his hair slowly pulled Dan away from his dreams. Groaning at the light, Dan just buried his face in Phil&rsquo;s naked chest. He felt Phil chuckle at his antics more than he heard it, and he certainly felt Phil&rsquo;s arms curl around Dan&rsquo;s body in order to hold him close. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; Phil said, his voice deep from sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;G'morning,&rdquo; Dan slurred, rubbing his eyes fiercely with the bottom of his palms. A few moments passed, but their silence was easy and comfortable. Dan let himself drink up the physical contact, a nagging part of his brain reminding him that this was something that he wouldn&rsquo;t get whenever he wanted very soon. </p><p>He had just started to feel his eyelids get heavy once again when Phil stirred underneath him. Dan groaned as Phil moved and inevitably disturbed the gentle equilibrium they had achieved. Phil giggled, and his hands stroking over Dan&rsquo;s back stilled. </p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;as much as I hate it, I&rsquo;m going to need to get up soon, Dan. It&rsquo;s almost ten and my train is at noon.&rdquo; </p><p>This time Dan <i>really</i> groaned. Dan made sure that it was loud and drawn out enough to express the depths of his displeasure. The wounded sound made Phil&rsquo;s eye crinkle in fondness. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. You understand that I don&rsquo;t like it either, right? I want you around me just as much as you do. Leaving is going to suck, but we can get through this. I&rsquo;m not that easy to get rid of.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan hummed to show he was listening. In reality, the words affected Dan more than he let on, and they made Dan&rsquo;s cheeks burn, but not in a bad way. </p><p>Phil pressed a kiss to Dan&rsquo;s temple. The action got Dan&rsquo;s attention, and he finally emerged from the comfort of Phil&rsquo;s chest to look up. Phil kissed him on the lips this time, and even though Phil was smiling too much to really make it a proper kiss, Dan was still satisfied and happy at the attention. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll see each other in person before you even know it.&rdquo; Phil let one of his hands bury itself in Dan&rsquo;s curls. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not even gone yet, so you&rsquo;re not allowed to be sad yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not not allowed, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Not allowed. You are legally required to be happy until noon today. Sorry for the inconvenience.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan laughed and pressed a kiss to Phil&rsquo;s jaw. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive you. When time did you want to leave for the station? I just need to know how much of my cuddle time is going to be missed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mhm, sure,&rdquo; Phil muttered before shifting Dan&rsquo;s body over slightly, &ldquo;Eleven fifteen? That should give me plenty of extra time to get to the station.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s grin spread wide, and he tightened his hold around Phi&rsquo;s waist. </p><p>&ldquo;Good. You can stay here a little bit longer then.&rdquo; </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>The ride to the station wasn&rsquo;t terribly long, and it is something that Dan is both thankful for and hates. </p><p>Part of him couldn&rsquo;t really stand sitting anxiously next to Phil\u2014while pretending to be fine\u2014any longer, and the other part of him froze at reality catching up with him as soon as the cab pulled up to the curb, waiting for the two of them to get out. </p><p>He helped Phil with his luggage, and he was a good boyfriend and paid for the cab before Phil could try and pull his wallet out of his pants. </p><p>Walking into the station wasn&rsquo;t that bad. Even watching Phil purchase his one-way ticket to London was manageable. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until they were a few feet from the doors, a smattering of people having their tickets inspected by a worker before getting onto the train, that the full weight of what was happening hit Dan like a fucking <i>truck</i>. </p><p>His legs kind of stopped mid stride, and a soft, strangled sound escaped his throat. Phil turned, a confused look in his eye, but once he saw Dan&rsquo;s ashen face Phil&rsquo;s own expression softened into one of understanding. He closed the distance between them and dropped his bags at their feet. Phil wrapped Dan in a hug, and Dan collapsed against him. He hadn&rsquo;t realized how much he had needed this hug, but now that it was happening? Dan didn&rsquo;t think that he would be able to let go. </p><p>One of Phil&rsquo;s hands slowly rubbed Dan&rsquo;s back, and a sob escaped Dan before he could contain it. Phil only held him tighter. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t, I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s body tensed as the five minute warning sounded. They didn&rsquo;t have much time, and the sudden urgency enveloped the both of them. </p><p>&ldquo;How can you be sure?&rdquo; Dan cried, his white-knuckled fists clenched tight onto Phil&rsquo;s jacket. </p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re too important, Dan Howell.&rdquo; Phil responded, pulling away so that their faces were close. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too important to <i>me</i>. I&rsquo;m willing to make this work. I am. I&rsquo;ll skype you as many times as you need me to, call you, text you, the whole package. And we&rsquo;ll visit each other as much as we can. I know that it&rsquo;s not the ideal set of circumstances, but trust me,&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s hands found their way to the sides of Dan&rsquo;s head, pulling him in, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to lose me.&rdquo; </p><p>The kiss completely swooped Dan off of his feet, and the sheer <i>intensity</i> of it only had Dan kissing Phil back harder, eager for anything that Phil was willing to give. In some other distant life there was another warning for passengers to board the train, but it was so much farther away than Phil. </p><p>They broke suddenly, each of them gasping for their breath. Phil&rsquo;s eyes snapped to Dan&rsquo;s, and their celestial blue held Dan&rsquo;s gaze completely. </p><p>&ldquo;This may not be the time or the place, but Daniel James Howell, you&rsquo;re never going to get rid of me because I&rsquo;m staying. And I&rsquo;m staying because I <i>love</i> you. I&rsquo;m not going to give up on us.&rdquo; </p><p>Tears sprung up from the corners of Dan&rsquo;s eyes, and he threw himself back onto Phil. The kiss started off just like the last, but it melted into something gentler, softer, and full of emotion. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; Dan muttered, &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>&ldquo;Daniel!&rdquo; Mary cried once she entered the shop. Dan had been scrolling on his phone while he waited for customers, but as soon as he heard her he snapped his head up and shoved his phone in his pocket. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mary,&rdquo; Dan said with a smile. He didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to hide his nonchalance because he was too happy to see the old woman. He was also sure that nothing would be able to hide the joy in his voice. </p><p>Mary had a cane now, and Dan was sure that it was because of her recovering from her surgery. It made her walk to the counter take more time, but that was okay because as soon as she got there Dan leaned over, and she wrapped him up in a great big hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Daniel, I&rsquo;ve missed you!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too.&rdquo; Dan laughed. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m certainly not complaining, but I thought you were still recovering from your surgery? And I don&rsquo;t want to hear about you coming all the way over here just to say hello if you weren&rsquo;t supposed to yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh those doctors don&rsquo;t know a thing about me. I know when I&rsquo;m ready to walk around, and I&rsquo;ve been going bonkers sitting at home all day.&rdquo; Mary looked around. &ldquo;Is Jaime working this morning? I was hoping to say hello to her too.&rdquo; </p><p>Something inside of Dan twisted at the sound of Jaime&rsquo;s name, and Dan struggled to maintain his composure. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, no, she&rsquo;s been spending a lot of time in London recently for the play. She hasn&rsquo;t been around a lot.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan had been sure that he had done an adequate job at maintaining the notion that everything was fine, but Mary instantly frowned and her lips pursed. Dan watched as she took a seat on one of the counter stools and set her purse down\u2014she was obviously ready to stay as long as needed. When she was comfortable, she met Dan&rsquo;s gaze again. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, sugar? I&rsquo;ve never seen you look so sad when we&rsquo;re talking about Jaime.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan felt himself deflate; there was no use keeping up the charade if she saw right through it. He scratched the back of his head, trying to find the words to explain to her exactly what was wrong. There were so many layers to the situation, and Dan didn&rsquo;t know where to start. He couldn&rsquo;t exactly think of a way to simplify it down to a clear, concrete <i>this is what&rsquo;s wrong</i> because Dan wasn&rsquo;t too sure that there was one. Things were just\u2026.wrong. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really long story, Mary. Everything&rsquo;s all kind of tangled together right now, and I don&rsquo;t want to take up your time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Daniel, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about me having anywhere else to be,&rdquo; she said, laughing a little before turning serious once again, &ldquo;but why don&rsquo;t you let me worry about that, alright? Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong, love.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan hesitated once again, but then he relented. He started from the beginning, and as soon as he started talking, it all came rushing out. Everything about the situations with Jaime\u2014and even Phil\u2014dribbled out of his mouth in a rambling, incohesive mess. Mary didn&rsquo;t interrupt him once, and she gave Dan all of his attention. By the end, Dan felt ten pounds lighter, but he also felt raw and kind of fragile. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you been talking to anyone else about this, or have you just been holding it all inside?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to my therapist, Gina, about the most of it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good, just you make sure that you start talking to her about all of it. It&rsquo;s not good to hold up the bad stuff inside our hearts because when you keep too much of it there too long it starts to make you sick.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m trying.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know you are, and I&rsquo;m proud of you. And in my experience, what Jaime&rsquo;s doing is something that people do an awful lot when they&rsquo;re in over their heads, which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at all because that&rsquo;s when we need each other the most. But sometimes people get scared or sad, or they&rsquo;re hurting, and they push others away. We&rsquo;re all guilty of it, and something tells me that right now, Jaime is scared or upset, and she&rsquo;s trying hard to deal with it all by herself. It&rsquo;s not healthy and she needs someone to help her see that, but you haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong, Daniel.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So you think I should show her that she should let people in?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if she was here, but it&rsquo;s horribly difficult to do it at such a distance.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan put his head in his hands and groaned. </p><p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s nothing I can do to fix this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Now I didn&rsquo;t say that. All you can do is wait right now and give her the space she wants. But once she starts to let you back in, make her feel welcome, and don&rsquo;t hold this against her. Be patient and let her know that you love her, and make sure to tell her that she doesn&rsquo;t have to face things alone. The only thing someone can do in a situation like this is to be there for the other person and let them know that they aren&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I just wish that none of this ever happened.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know hun,&rdquo; Mary said, patting Dan&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I know. Can I ask you something else?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, Mary.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Have you told Phil about you thinking about moving in with him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Dan grimaced. </p><p>&ldquo;I think you should, baby. He&rsquo;d be over the moon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But what if moving to London isn&rsquo;t the right decision?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What if things between us don&rsquo;t work out? Or if he doesn&rsquo;t want to move in with me? Or if my job doesn&rsquo;t work out, or a million other things. What if moving to London is a bad thing? I mean, I&rsquo;m fine here in Manchester. I have a flat and a job I can count on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Daniel, honey, every decision in your life is going to have a million possible bad things attached to it, but there are also a million good things too. What if this move brings you two closer? What if you find a place to work at that you love? Or what about how this move can ease your troubles over a long-distance relationship? You will never make a decision that doesn&rsquo;t have the potential to backfire, but you can&rsquo;t let that stop you. You can&rsquo;t let the fear of change stop you because then you&rsquo;ll stay put, and that&rsquo;s what I think you&rsquo;ve been doing. You&rsquo;re not meant to be a barista for your whole life, Daniel, and you aren&rsquo;t meant to stay in this job and that flat just because it&rsquo;s stable. One of the things about life is that you&rsquo;ve got to take risks sometimes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You think I should do it, then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think that you should think long and hard about it, and do what you&rsquo;re heart&rsquo;s telling you to do.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nodded, his thoughts already a little distant. </p><p>He knew what his heart wanted. He didn&rsquo;t even really have to think about it, and he knew that Mary was right. </p><p>He just didn&rsquo;t know if he had the courage to do it. </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>Dan slid his luggage under his chair before sitting next to the window. He put his earbuds in and pulled up a playlist that he had made a few days earlier for this exact trip. As the beginning melodies of the first song started to play, Dan rested his head against the glass. Everyone had stopped boarding the train at this point, and how they all just had to take their seats. </p><p>He vaguely heard the loudspeaker announce that the train would start moving\u2014he really could only make out the sound of someone speaking over the music playing in his ears, but not any words\u2014and a few moments later Dan felt as the train lurched forward. </p><p>It was kind of surreal to watch the station glide past him, and soon they were out of the city and chugging along the landscape. Trees and hills kept flying by to the soundtrack that was playing in Dan&rsquo;s ears, but Dan was tired, so he let his eyelids fall closed. </p><p>He was on his way to London for a few days. It wasn&rsquo;t permanent\u2014only a visit\u2014but Dan was still more than happy. He and Phil had been apart for just over three weeks now, and the distance was killing them both. </p><p>Dan still hadn&rsquo;t talked to Phil about moving in yet, but he was more than planning on doing it. He just needed a when, and probably a few other possible jobs to make sure that Dan would be able to have one lined up by the time that he moved in. London was expensive, and Dan knew that if they were going to make this work then they both had to be working. </p><p>The future still had so many possible outcomes, both good and bad, and Dan still had so many ideas of what he wanted to do. None of them were completely settled, but they were no longer flimsy, transparent daydreams. </p><p>With a little bit more time, Dan was sure that something would come out of them. </p><p>He had a few hours to go before he arrived in London, and Dan slumped a little bit more in the chair, his eyes still shut. It was late, he had just gotten off of work, and he was tired. </p><p>In his pocket, Dan felt his phone buzz, and he smiled, knowing that it was Phil texting him to probably let Dan know how excited he was. Dan didn&rsquo;t take his phone out to respond, he was too close to sleep for that, but he knew what he would say. And he knew that Phil knew too. </p><p><i>Me too, Phil,</i> he thought, <i>I&rsquo;m excited too. </i></p>",

His gaze traced from the bow of Phil\u2019s lips to the slopes of his nose to the morning light fanning across Phil\u2019s cheekbones. Dan let his fingers leave the warmth of the duvet and brush away some of the black fringe that had fallen over Phil\u2019s face overnight.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Phil had been in Manchester all week for some time with Dan and to tie up some other loose ends that he would be leaving behind with a move to London. Last night had been the last one that Phil would be spending in Manchester for a while, and they had both wanted to spend the time together. Even regarding the fact that Phil had already signed the lease off his Manchester flat and didn\u2019t have a place to stay, it had been an easy decision for Phil to spend the night at Dan\u2019s. And after an already wonderful day and night together, Dan was more than happy to keep Phil in his grasp a little longer. </p><p>But he couldn\u2019t keep Phil forever. </p><p>Phil had a train to catch at about noon, and it was close to nine in the morning already. The train would take him to London, where he would be living from now on. The thought of saying goodbye to Phil without the assurance that he would be returning after a few days was daunting, and even though Dan wanted to be as supportive as possible, he just wanted to stay in bed with Phil forever. \u00a0</p><p>Who needed to work? They could both just lie here in their little bubble and forget the world. </p><p>Dan moved closer to Phil\u2019s still-sleeping form and tucked himself under Phil\u2019s chin. He closed his eyes once he was settled and let his body sink against Phil\u2019s. After a life of shutting people out and being shut out, Dan still reveled in how good it felt to be vulnerable in the presence and care of someone gentle and trustworthy. </p><p>Barely-there fingers running through his hair slowly pulled Dan away from his dreams. Groaning at the light, Dan just buried his face in Phil\u2019s naked chest. He felt Phil chuckle at his antics more than he heard it, and he certainly felt Phil\u2019s arms curl around Dan\u2019s body in order to hold him close. </p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Phil said, his voice deep from sleep. </p><p>\u201cG'morning,\u201d Dan slurred, rubbing his eyes fiercely with the bottom of his palms. A few moments passed, but their silence was easy and comfortable. Dan let himself drink up the physical contact, a nagging part of his brain reminding him that this was something that he wouldn\u2019t get whenever he wanted very soon. </p><p>He had just started to feel his eyelids get heavy once again when Phil stirred underneath him. Dan groaned as Phil moved and inevitably disturbed the gentle equilibrium they had achieved. Phil giggled, and his hands stroking over Dan\u2019s back stilled. </p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he whispered, \u201cas much as I hate it, I\u2019m going to need to get up soon, Dan. It\u2019s almost ten and my train is at noon.\u201d </p><p>This time Dan <i>really</i> groaned. Dan made sure that it was loud and drawn out enough to express the depths of his displeasure. The wounded sound made Phil\u2019s eye crinkle in fondness. </p><p>\u201cI know, I know. You understand that I don\u2019t like it either, right? I want you around me just as much as you do. Leaving is going to suck, but we can get through this. I\u2019m not that easy to get rid of.\u201d </p><p>Dan hummed to show he was listening. In reality, the words affected Dan more than he let on, and they made Dan\u2019s cheeks burn, but not in a bad way. </p><p>Phil pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s temple. The action got Dan\u2019s attention, and he finally emerged from the comfort of Phil\u2019s chest to look up. Phil kissed him on the lips this time, and even though Phil was smiling too much to really make it a proper kiss, Dan was still satisfied and happy at the attention. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll see each other in person before you even know it.\u201d Phil let one of his hands bury itself in Dan\u2019s curls. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not even gone yet, so you\u2019re not allowed to be sad yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not not allowed, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Not allowed. You are legally required to be happy until noon today. Sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d </p><p>Dan laughed and pressed a kiss to Phil\u2019s jaw. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll forgive you. When time did you want to leave for the station? I just need to know how much of my cuddle time is going to be missed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMhm, sure,\u201d Phil muttered before shifting Dan\u2019s body over slightly, \u201cEleven fifteen? That should give me plenty of extra time to get to the station.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s grin spread wide, and he tightened his hold around Phi\u2019s waist. </p><p>\u201cGood. You can stay here a little bit longer then.\u201d </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>The ride to the station wasn\u2019t terribly long, and it is something that Dan is both thankful for and hates. </p><p>Part of him couldn\u2019t really stand sitting anxiously next to Phil\u2014while pretending to be fine\u2014any longer, and the other part of him froze at reality catching up with him as soon as the cab pulled up to the curb, waiting for the two of them to get out. </p><p>He helped Phil with his luggage, and he was a good boyfriend and paid for the cab before Phil could try and pull his wallet out of his pants. </p><p>Walking into the station wasn\u2019t that bad. Even watching Phil purchase his one-way ticket to London was manageable. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were a few feet from the doors, a smattering of people having their tickets inspected by a worker before getting onto the train, that the full weight of what was happening hit Dan like a fucking <i>truck</i>. </p><p>His legs kind of stopped mid stride, and a soft, strangled sound escaped his throat. Phil turned, a confused look in his eye, but once he saw Dan\u2019s ashen face Phil\u2019s own expression softened into one of understanding. He closed the distance between them and dropped his bags at their feet. Phil wrapped Dan in a hug, and Dan collapsed against him. He hadn\u2019t realized how much he had needed this hug, but now that it was happening? Dan didn\u2019t think that he would be able to let go. </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s hands slowly rubbed Dan\u2019s back, and a sob escaped Dan before he could contain it. Phil only held him tighter. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s body tensed as the five minute warning sounded. They didn\u2019t have much time, and the sudden urgency enveloped the both of them. </p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d Dan cried, his white-knuckled fists clenched tight onto Phil\u2019s jacket. </p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re too important, Dan Howell.\u201d Phil responded, pulling away so that their faces were close. \u201cYou\u2019re too important to <i>me</i>. I\u2019m willing to make this work. I am. I\u2019ll skype you as many times as you need me to, call you, text you, the whole package. And we\u2019ll visit each other as much as we can. I know that it\u2019s not the ideal set of circumstances, but trust me,\u201d Phil\u2019s hands found their way to the sides of Dan\u2019s head, pulling him in, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to lose me.\u201d </p><p>The kiss completely swooped Dan off of his feet, and the sheer <i>intensity</i> of it only had Dan kissing Phil back harder, eager for anything that Phil was willing to give. In some other distant life there was another warning for passengers to board the train, but it was so much farther away than Phil. </p><p>They broke suddenly, each of them gasping for their breath. Phil\u2019s eyes snapped to Dan\u2019s, and their celestial blue held Dan\u2019s gaze completely. </p><p>\u201cThis may not be the time or the place, but Daniel James Howell, you\u2019re never going to get rid of me because I\u2019m staying. And I\u2019m staying because I <i>love</i> you. I\u2019m not going to give up on us.\u201d </p><p>Tears sprung up from the corners of Dan\u2019s eyes, and he threw himself back onto Phil. The kiss started off just like the last, but it melted into something gentler, softer, and full of emotion. </p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Dan muttered, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>\u201cDaniel!\u201d Mary cried once she entered the shop. Dan had been scrolling on his phone while he waited for customers, but as soon as he heard her he snapped his head up and shoved his phone in his pocket. </p><p>\u201cHey, Mary,\u201d Dan said with a smile. He didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide his nonchalance because he was too happy to see the old woman. He was also sure that nothing would be able to hide the joy in his voice. </p><p>Mary had a cane now, and Dan was sure that it was because of her recovering from her surgery. It made her walk to the counter take more time, but that was okay because as soon as she got there Dan leaned over, and she wrapped him up in a great big hug. </p><p>\u201cOh, Daniel, I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cNow I\u2019m certainly not complaining, but I thought you were still recovering from your surgery? And I don\u2019t want to hear about you coming all the way over here just to say hello if you weren\u2019t supposed to yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh those doctors don\u2019t know a thing about me. I know when I\u2019m ready to walk around, and I\u2019ve been going bonkers sitting at home all day.\u201d Mary looked around. \u201cIs Jaime working this morning? I was hoping to say hello to her too.\u201d </p><p>Something inside of Dan twisted at the sound of Jaime\u2019s name, and Dan struggled to maintain his composure. </p><p>\u201cAh, no, she\u2019s been spending a lot of time in London recently for the play. She hasn\u2019t been around a lot.\u201d </p><p>Dan had been sure that he had done an adequate job at maintaining the notion that everything was fine, but Mary instantly frowned and her lips pursed. Dan watched as she took a seat on one of the counter stools and set her purse down\u2014she was obviously ready to stay as long as needed. When she was comfortable, she met Dan\u2019s gaze again. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sugar? I\u2019ve never seen you look so sad when we\u2019re talking about Jaime.\u201d </p><p>Dan felt himself deflate; there was no use keeping up the charade if she saw right through it. He scratched the back of his head, trying to find the words to explain to her exactly what was wrong. There were so many layers to the situation, and Dan didn\u2019t know where to start. He couldn\u2019t exactly think of a way to simplify it down to a clear, concrete <i>this is what\u2019s wrong</i> because Dan wasn\u2019t too sure that there was one. Things were just\u2026.wrong. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really long story, Mary. Everything\u2019s all kind of tangled together right now, and I don\u2019t want to take up your time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDaniel, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about me having anywhere else to be,\u201d she said, laughing a little before turning serious once again, \u201cbut why don\u2019t you let me worry about that, alright? Tell me what\u2019s wrong, love.\u201d </p><p>Dan hesitated once again, but then he relented. He started from the beginning, and as soon as he started talking, it all came rushing out. Everything about the situations with Jaime\u2014and even Phil\u2014dribbled out of his mouth in a rambling, incohesive mess. Mary didn\u2019t interrupt him once, and she gave Dan all of his attention. By the end, Dan felt ten pounds lighter, but he also felt raw and kind of fragile. </p><p>\u201cHave you been talking to anyone else about this, or have you just been holding it all inside?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to my therapist, Gina, about the most of it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood, just you make sure that you start talking to her about all of it. It\u2019s not good to hold up the bad stuff inside our hearts because when you keep too much of it there too long it starts to make you sick.\u201d </p><p>Dan nodded. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m trying.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know you are, and I\u2019m proud of you. And in my experience, what Jaime\u2019s doing is something that people do an awful lot when they\u2019re in over their heads, which doesn\u2019t make any sense at all because that\u2019s when we need each other the most. But sometimes people get scared or sad, or they\u2019re hurting, and they push others away. We\u2019re all guilty of it, and something tells me that right now, Jaime is scared or upset, and she\u2019s trying hard to deal with it all by herself. It\u2019s not healthy and she needs someone to help her see that, but you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, Daniel.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you think I should show her that she should let people in?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe if she was here, but it\u2019s horribly difficult to do it at such a distance.\u201d </p><p>Dan put his head in his hands and groaned. </p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing I can do to fix this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNow I didn\u2019t say that. All you can do is wait right now and give her the space she wants. But once she starts to let you back in, make her feel welcome, and don\u2019t hold this against her. Be patient and let her know that you love her, and make sure to tell her that she doesn\u2019t have to face things alone. The only thing someone can do in a situation like this is to be there for the other person and let them know that they aren\u2019t alone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just wish that none of this ever happened.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know hun,\u201d Mary said, patting Dan\u2019s hand, \u201cI know. Can I ask you something else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, Mary.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHave you told Phil about you thinking about moving in with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dan grimaced. </p><p>\u201cI think you should, baby. He\u2019d be over the moon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut what if moving to London isn\u2019t the right decision?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if things between us don\u2019t work out? Or if he doesn\u2019t want to move in with me? Or if my job doesn\u2019t work out, or a million other things. What if moving to London is a bad thing? I mean, I\u2019m fine here in Manchester. I have a flat and a job I can count on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDaniel, honey, every decision in your life is going to have a million possible bad things attached to it, but there are also a million good things too. What if this move brings you two closer? What if you find a place to work at that you love? Or what about how this move can ease your troubles over a long-distance relationship? You will never make a decision that doesn\u2019t have the potential to backfire, but you can\u2019t let that stop you. You can\u2019t let the fear of change stop you because then you\u2019ll stay put, and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019ve been doing. You\u2019re not meant to be a barista for your whole life, Daniel, and you aren\u2019t meant to stay in this job and that flat just because it\u2019s stable. One of the things about life is that you\u2019ve got to take risks sometimes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think I should do it, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think that you should think long and hard about it, and do what you\u2019re heart\u2019s telling you to do.\u201d </p><p>Dan nodded, his thoughts already a little distant. </p><p>He knew what his heart wanted. He didn\u2019t even really have to think about it, and he knew that Mary was right. </p><p>He just didn\u2019t know if he had the courage to do it. </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>Dan slid his luggage under his chair before sitting next to the window. He put his earbuds in and pulled up a playlist that he had made a few days earlier for this exact trip. As the beginning melodies of the first song started to play, Dan rested his head against the glass. Everyone had stopped boarding the train at this point, and how they all just had to take their seats. </p><p>He vaguely heard the loudspeaker announce that the train would start moving\u2014he really could only make out the sound of someone speaking over the music playing in his ears, but not any words\u2014and a few moments later Dan felt as the train lurched forward. </p><p>It was kind of surreal to watch the station glide past him, and soon they were out of the city and chugging along the landscape. Trees and hills kept flying by to the soundtrack that was playing in Dan\u2019s ears, but Dan was tired, so he let his eyelids fall closed. </p><p>He was on his way to London for a few days. It wasn\u2019t permanent\u2014only a visit\u2014but Dan was still more than happy. He and Phil had been apart for just over three weeks now, and the distance was killing them both. </p><p>Dan still hadn\u2019t talked to Phil about moving in yet, but he was more than planning on doing it. He just needed a when, and probably a few other possible jobs to make sure that Dan would be able to have one lined up by the time that he moved in. London was expensive, and Dan knew that if they were going to make this work then they both had to be working. </p><p>The future still had so many possible outcomes, both good and bad, and Dan still had so many ideas of what he wanted to do. None of them were completely settled, but they were no longer flimsy, transparent daydreams. </p><p>With a little bit more time, Dan was sure that something would come out of them. </p><p>He had a few hours to go before he arrived in London, and Dan slumped a little bit more in the chair, his eyes still shut. It was late, he had just gotten off of work, and he was tired. </p><p>In his pocket, Dan felt his phone buzz, and he smiled, knowing that it was Phil texting him to probably let Dan know how excited he was. Dan didn\u2019t take his phone out to respond, he was too close to sleep for that, but he knew what he would say. And he knew that Phil knew too. </p><p><i>Me too, Phil,</i> he thought, <i>I\u2019m excited too. </i></p>",

Last night had been the last one that Phil would be spending in Manchester for a while, and they had both wanted to spend the time together. Even regarding the fact that Phil had already signed the lease off his Manchester flat and didn\u2019t have a place to stay, it had been an easy decision for Phil to spend the night at Dan\u2019s. And after an already wonderful day and night together, Dan was more than happy to keep Phil in his grasp a little longer. </p><p>But he couldn\u2019t keep Phil forever. </p><p>Phil had a train to catch at about noon, and it was close to nine in the morning already. The train would take him to London, where he would be living from now on. The thought of saying goodbye to Phil without the assurance that he would be returning after a few days was daunting, and even though Dan wanted to be as supportive as possible, he just wanted to stay in bed with Phil forever. \u00a0</p><p>Who needed to work? They could both just lie here in their little bubble and forget the world. </p><p>Dan moved closer to Phil\u2019s still-sleeping form and tucked himself under Phil\u2019s chin. He closed his eyes once he was settled and let his body sink against Phil\u2019s. After a life of shutting people out and being shut out, Dan still reveled in how good it felt to be vulnerable in the presence and care of someone gentle and trustworthy. </p><p>Barely-there fingers running through his hair slowly pulled Dan away from his dreams. Groaning at the light, Dan just buried his face in Phil\u2019s naked chest. He felt Phil chuckle at his antics more than he heard it, and he certainly felt Phil\u2019s arms curl around Dan\u2019s body in order to hold him close. </p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Phil said, his voice deep from sleep. </p><p>\u201cG'morning,\u201d Dan slurred, rubbing his eyes fiercely with the bottom of his palms. A few moments passed, but their silence was easy and comfortable. Dan let himself drink up the physical contact, a nagging part of his brain reminding him that this was something that he wouldn\u2019t get whenever he wanted very soon. </p><p>He had just started to feel his eyelids get heavy once again when Phil stirred underneath him. Dan groaned as Phil moved and inevitably disturbed the gentle equilibrium they had achieved. Phil giggled, and his hands stroking over Dan\u2019s back stilled. </p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he whispered, \u201cas much as I hate it, I\u2019m going to need to get up soon, Dan. It\u2019s almost ten and my train is at noon.\u201d </p><p>This time Dan <i>really</i> groaned. Dan made sure that it was loud and drawn out enough to express the depths of his displeasure. The wounded sound made Phil\u2019s eye crinkle in fondness. </p><p>\u201cI know, I know. You understand that I don\u2019t like it either, right? I want you around me just as much as you do. Leaving is going to suck, but we can get through this. I\u2019m not that easy to get rid of.\u201d </p><p>Dan hummed to show he was listening. In reality, the words affected Dan more than he let on, and they made Dan\u2019s cheeks burn, but not in a bad way. </p><p>Phil pressed a kiss to Dan\u2019s temple. The action got Dan\u2019s attention, and he finally emerged from the comfort of Phil\u2019s chest to look up. Phil kissed him on the lips this time, and even though Phil was smiling too much to really make it a proper kiss, Dan was still satisfied and happy at the attention. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll see each other in person before you even know it.\u201d Phil let one of his hands bury itself in Dan\u2019s curls. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not even gone yet, so you\u2019re not allowed to be sad yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not not allowed, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Not allowed. You are legally required to be happy until noon today. Sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d </p><p>Dan laughed and pressed a kiss to Phil\u2019s jaw. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll forgive you. When time did you want to leave for the station? I just need to know how much of my cuddle time is going to be missed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMhm, sure,\u201d Phil muttered before shifting Dan\u2019s body over slightly, \u201cEleven fifteen? That should give me plenty of extra time to get to the station.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s grin spread wide, and he tightened his hold around Phi\u2019s waist. </p><p>\u201cGood. You can stay here a little bit longer then.\u201d </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>The ride to the station wasn\u2019t terribly long, and it is something that Dan is both thankful for and hates. </p><p>Part of him couldn\u2019t really stand sitting anxiously next to Phil\u2014while pretending to be fine\u2014any longer, and the other part of him froze at reality catching up with him as soon as the cab pulled up to the curb, waiting for the two of them to get out. </p><p>He helped Phil with his luggage, and he was a good boyfriend and paid for the cab before Phil could try and pull his wallet out of his pants. </p><p>Walking into the station wasn\u2019t that bad. Even watching Phil purchase his one-way ticket to London was manageable. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were a few feet from the doors, a smattering of people having their tickets inspected by a worker before getting onto the train, that the full weight of what was happening hit Dan like a fucking <i>truck</i>. </p><p>His legs kind of stopped mid stride, and a soft, strangled sound escaped his throat. Phil turned, a confused look in his eye, but once he saw Dan\u2019s ashen face Phil\u2019s own expression softened into one of understanding. He closed the distance between them and dropped his bags at their feet. Phil wrapped Dan in a hug, and Dan collapsed against him. He hadn\u2019t realized how much he had needed this hug, but now that it was happening? Dan didn\u2019t think that he would be able to let go. </p><p>One of Phil\u2019s hands slowly rubbed Dan\u2019s back, and a sob escaped Dan before he could contain it. Phil only held him tighter. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s body tensed as the five minute warning sounded. They didn\u2019t have much time, and the sudden urgency enveloped the both of them. </p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d Dan cried, his white-knuckled fists clenched tight onto Phil\u2019s jacket. </p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re too important, Dan Howell.\u201d Phil responded, pulling away so that their faces were close. \u201cYou\u2019re too important to <i>me</i>. I\u2019m willing to make this work. I am. I\u2019ll skype you as many times as you need me to, call you, text you, the whole package. And we\u2019ll visit each other as much as we can. I know that it\u2019s not the ideal set of circumstances, but trust me,\u201d Phil\u2019s hands found their way to the sides of Dan\u2019s head, pulling him in, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to lose me.\u201d </p><p>The kiss completely swooped Dan off of his feet, and the sheer <i>intensity</i> of it only had Dan kissing Phil back harder, eager for anything that Phil was willing to give. In some other distant life there was another warning for passengers to board the train, but it was so much farther away than Phil. </p><p>They broke suddenly, each of them gasping for their breath. Phil\u2019s eyes snapped to Dan\u2019s, and their celestial blue held Dan\u2019s gaze completely. </p><p>\u201cThis may not be the time or the place, but Daniel James Howell, you\u2019re never going to get rid of me because I\u2019m staying. And I\u2019m staying because I <i>love</i> you. I\u2019m not going to give up on us.\u201d </p><p>Tears sprung up from the corners of Dan\u2019s eyes, and he threw himself back onto Phil. The kiss started off just like the last, but it melted into something gentler, softer, and full of emotion. </p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Dan muttered, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>\u201cDaniel!\u201d Mary cried once she entered the shop. Dan had been scrolling on his phone while he waited for customers, but as soon as he heard her he snapped his head up and shoved his phone in his pocket. </p><p>\u201cHey, Mary,\u201d Dan said with a smile. He didn\u2019t even bother trying to hide his nonchalance because he was too happy to see the old woman. He was also sure that nothing would be able to hide the joy in his voice. </p><p>Mary had a cane now, and Dan was sure that it was because of her recovering from her surgery. It made her walk to the counter take more time, but that was okay because as soon as she got there Dan leaned over, and she wrapped him up in a great big hug. </p><p>\u201cOh, Daniel, I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cNow I\u2019m certainly not complaining, but I thought you were still recovering from your surgery? And I don\u2019t want to hear about you coming all the way over here just to say hello if you weren\u2019t supposed to yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh those doctors don\u2019t know a thing about me. I know when I\u2019m ready to walk around, and I\u2019ve been going bonkers sitting at home all day.\u201d Mary looked around. \u201cIs Jaime working this morning? I was hoping to say hello to her too.\u201d </p><p>Something inside of Dan twisted at the sound of Jaime\u2019s name, and Dan struggled to maintain his composure. </p><p>\u201cAh, no, she\u2019s been spending a lot of time in London recently for the play. She hasn\u2019t been around a lot.\u201d </p><p>Dan had been sure that he had done an adequate job at maintaining the notion that everything was fine, but Mary instantly frowned and her lips pursed. Dan watched as she took a seat on one of the counter stools and set her purse down\u2014she was obviously ready to stay as long as needed. When she was comfortable, she met Dan\u2019s gaze again. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sugar? I\u2019ve never seen you look so sad when we\u2019re talking about Jaime.\u201d </p><p>Dan felt himself deflate; there was no use keeping up the charade if she saw right through it. He scratched the back of his head, trying to find the words to explain to her exactly what was wrong. There were so many layers to the situation, and Dan didn\u2019t know where to start. He couldn\u2019t exactly think of a way to simplify it down to a clear, concrete <i>this is what\u2019s wrong</i> because Dan wasn\u2019t too sure that there was one. Things were just\u2026.wrong. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really long story, Mary. Everything\u2019s all kind of tangled together right now, and I don\u2019t want to take up your time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDaniel, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about me having anywhere else to be,\u201d she said, laughing a little before turning serious once again, \u201cbut why don\u2019t you let me worry about that, alright? Tell me what\u2019s wrong, love.\u201d </p><p>Dan hesitated once again, but then he relented. He started from the beginning, and as soon as he started talking, it all came rushing out. Everything about the situations with Jaime\u2014and even Phil\u2014dribbled out of his mouth in a rambling, incohesive mess. Mary didn\u2019t interrupt him once, and she gave Dan all of his attention. By the end, Dan felt ten pounds lighter, but he also felt raw and kind of fragile. </p><p>\u201cHave you been talking to anyone else about this, or have you just been holding it all inside?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to my therapist, Gina, about the most of it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood, just you make sure that you start talking to her about all of it. It\u2019s not good to hold up the bad stuff inside our hearts because when you keep too much of it there too long it starts to make you sick.\u201d </p><p>Dan nodded. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m trying.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know you are, and I\u2019m proud of you. And in my experience, what Jaime\u2019s doing is something that people do an awful lot when they\u2019re in over their heads, which doesn\u2019t make any sense at all because that\u2019s when we need each other the most. But sometimes people get scared or sad, or they\u2019re hurting, and they push others away. We\u2019re all guilty of it, and something tells me that right now, Jaime is scared or upset, and she\u2019s trying hard to deal with it all by herself. It\u2019s not healthy and she needs someone to help her see that, but you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, Daniel.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo you think I should show her that she should let people in?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe if she was here, but it\u2019s horribly difficult to do it at such a distance.\u201d </p><p>Dan put his head in his hands and groaned. </p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing I can do to fix this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNow I didn\u2019t say that. All you can do is wait right now and give her the space she wants. But once she starts to let you back in, make her feel welcome, and don\u2019t hold this against her. Be patient and let her know that you love her, and make sure to tell her that she doesn\u2019t have to face things alone. The only thing someone can do in a situation like this is to be there for the other person and let them know that they aren\u2019t alone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just wish that none of this ever happened.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know hun,\u201d Mary said, patting Dan\u2019s hand, \u201cI know. Can I ask you something else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, Mary.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHave you told Phil about you thinking about moving in with him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dan grimaced. </p><p>\u201cI think you should, baby. He\u2019d be over the moon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut what if moving to London isn\u2019t the right decision?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if things between us don\u2019t work out? Or if he doesn\u2019t want to move in with me? Or if my job doesn\u2019t work out, or a million other things. What if moving to London is a bad thing? I mean, I\u2019m fine here in Manchester. I have a flat and a job I can count on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDaniel, honey, every decision in your life is going to have a million possible bad things attached to it, but there are also a million good things too. What if this move brings you two closer? What if you find a place to work at that you love? Or what about how this move can ease your troubles over a long-distance relationship? You will never make a decision that doesn\u2019t have the potential to backfire, but you can\u2019t let that stop you. You can\u2019t let the fear of change stop you because then you\u2019ll stay put, and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019ve been doing. You\u2019re not meant to be a barista for your whole life, Daniel, and you aren\u2019t meant to stay in this job and that flat just because it\u2019s stable. One of the things about life is that you\u2019ve got to take risks sometimes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think I should do it, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think that you should think long and hard about it, and do what you\u2019re heart\u2019s telling you to do.\u201d </p><p>Dan nodded, his thoughts already a little distant. </p><p>He knew what his heart wanted. He didn\u2019t even really have to think about it, and he knew that Mary was right. </p><p>He just didn\u2019t know if he had the courage to do it. </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>Dan slid his luggage under his chair before sitting next to the window. He put his earbuds in and pulled up a playlist that he had made a few days earlier for this exact trip. As the beginning melodies of the first song started to play, Dan rested his head against the glass. Everyone had stopped boarding the train at this point, and how they all just had to take their seats. </p><p>He vaguely heard the loudspeaker announce that the train would start moving\u2014he really could only make out the sound of someone speaking over the music playing in his ears, but not any words\u2014and a few moments later Dan felt as the train lurched forward. </p><p>It was kind of surreal to watch the station glide past him, and soon they were out of the city and chugging along the landscape. Trees and hills kept flying by to the soundtrack that was playing in Dan\u2019s ears, but Dan was tired, so he let his eyelids fall closed. </p><p>He was on his way to London for a few days. It wasn\u2019t permanent\u2014only a visit\u2014but Dan was still more than happy. He and Phil had been apart for just over three weeks now, and the distance was killing them both. </p><p>Dan still hadn\u2019t talked to Phil about moving in yet, but he was more than planning on doing it. He just needed a when, and probably a few other possible jobs to make sure that Dan would be able to have one lined up by the time that he moved in. London was expensive, and Dan knew that if they were going to make this work then they both had to be working. </p><p>The future still had so many possible outcomes, both good and bad, and Dan still had so many ideas of what he wanted to do. None of them were completely settled, but they were no longer flimsy, transparent daydreams. </p><p>With a little bit more time, Dan was sure that something would come out of them. </p><p>He had a few hours to go before he arrived in London, and Dan slumped a little bit more in the chair, his eyes still shut. It was late, he had just gotten off of work, and he was tired. </p><p>In his pocket, Dan felt his phone buzz, and he smiled, knowing that it was Phil texting him to probably let Dan know how excited he was. Dan didn\u2019t take his phone out to respond, he was too close to sleep for that, but he knew what he would say. And he knew that Phil knew too. </p><p><i>Me too, Phil,</i> he thought, <i>I\u2019m excited too. </i></p>",

That should give me plenty of extra time to get to the station.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s grin spread wide, and he tightened his hold around Phi&rsquo;s waist. </p><p>&ldquo;Good. You can stay here a little bit longer then.&rdquo; </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>The ride to the station wasn&rsquo;t terribly long, and it is something that Dan is both thankful for and hates. </p><p>Part of him couldn&rsquo;t really stand sitting anxiously next to Phil&mdash;while pretending to be fine&mdash;any longer, and the other part of him froze at reality catching up with him as soon as the cab pulled up to the curb, waiting for the two of them to get out. </p><p>He helped Phil with his luggage, and he was a good boyfriend and paid for the cab before Phil could try and pull his wallet out of his pants. </p><p>Walking into the station wasn&rsquo;t that bad. Even watching Phil purchase his one-way ticket to London was manageable. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until they were a few feet from the doors, a smattering of people having their tickets inspected by a worker before getting onto the train, that the full weight of what was happening hit Dan like a fucking <i>truck</i>. </p><p>His legs kind of stopped mid stride, and a soft, strangled sound escaped his throat. Phil turned, a confused look in his eye, but once he saw Dan&rsquo;s ashen face Phil&rsquo;s own expression softened into one of understanding. He closed the distance between them and dropped his bags at their feet. Phil wrapped Dan in a hug, and Dan collapsed against him. He hadn&rsquo;t realized how much he had needed this hug, but now that it was happening? Dan didn&rsquo;t think that he would be able to let go. </p><p>One of Phil&rsquo;s hands slowly rubbed Dan&rsquo;s back, and a sob escaped Dan before he could contain it. Phil only held him tighter. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t, I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s body tensed as the five minute warning sounded. They didn&rsquo;t have much time, and the sudden urgency enveloped the both of them. </p><p>&ldquo;How can you be sure?&rdquo; Dan cried, his white-knuckled fists clenched tight onto Phil&rsquo;s jacket. </p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re too important, Dan Howell.&rdquo; Phil responded, pulling away so that their faces were close. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too important to <i>me</i>. I&rsquo;m willing to make this work. I am. I&rsquo;ll skype you as many times as you need me to, call you, text you, the whole package. And we&rsquo;ll visit each other as much as we can. I know that it&rsquo;s not the ideal set of circumstances, but trust me,&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s hands found their way to the sides of Dan&rsquo;s head, pulling him in, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to lose me.&rdquo; </p><p>The kiss completely swooped Dan off of his feet, and the sheer <i>intensity</i> of it only had Dan kissing Phil back harder, eager for anything that Phil was willing to give. In some other distant life there was another warning for passengers to board the train, but it was so much farther away than Phil. </p><p>They broke suddenly, each of them gasping for their breath. Phil&rsquo;s eyes snapped to Dan&rsquo;s, and their celestial blue held Dan&rsquo;s gaze completely. </p><p>&ldquo;This may not be the time or the place, but Daniel James Howell, you&rsquo;re never going to get rid of me because I&rsquo;m staying. And I&rsquo;m staying because I <i>love</i> you. I&rsquo;m not going to give up on us.&rdquo; </p><p>Tears sprung up from the corners of Dan&rsquo;s eyes, and he threw himself back onto Phil. The kiss started off just like the last, but it melted into something gentler, softer, and full of emotion. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; Dan muttered, &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>&ldquo;Daniel!&rdquo; Mary cried once she entered the shop. Dan had been scrolling on his phone while he waited for customers, but as soon as he heard her he snapped his head up and shoved his phone in his pocket. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mary,&rdquo; Dan said with a smile. He didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to hide his nonchalance because he was too happy to see the old woman. He was also sure that nothing would be able to hide the joy in his voice. </p><p>Mary had a cane now, and Dan was sure that it was because of her recovering from her surgery. It made her walk to the counter take more time, but that was okay because as soon as she got there Dan leaned over, and she wrapped him up in a great big hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Daniel, I&rsquo;ve missed you!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too.&rdquo; Dan laughed. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m certainly not complaining, but I thought you were still recovering from your surgery? And I don&rsquo;t want to hear about you coming all the way over here just to say hello if you weren&rsquo;t supposed to yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh those doctors don&rsquo;t know a thing about me. I know when I&rsquo;m ready to walk around, and I&rsquo;ve been going bonkers sitting at home all day.&rdquo; Mary looked around. &ldquo;Is Jaime working this morning? I was hoping to say hello to her too.&rdquo; </p><p>Something inside of Dan twisted at the sound of Jaime&rsquo;s name, and Dan struggled to maintain his composure. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah, no, she&rsquo;s been spending a lot of time in London recently for the play. She hasn&rsquo;t been around a lot.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan had been sure that he had done an adequate job at maintaining the notion that everything was fine, but Mary instantly frowned and her lips pursed. Dan watched as she took a seat on one of the counter stools and set her purse down&mdash;she was obviously ready to stay as long as needed. When she was comfortable, she met Dan&rsquo;s gaze again. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, sugar? I&rsquo;ve never seen you look so sad when we&rsquo;re talking about Jaime.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan felt himself deflate; there was no use keeping up the charade if she saw right through it. He scratched the back of his head, trying to find the words to explain to her exactly what was wrong. There were so many layers to the situation, and Dan didn&rsquo;t know where to start. He couldn&rsquo;t exactly think of a way to simplify it down to a clear, concrete <i>this is what&rsquo;s wrong</i> because Dan wasn&rsquo;t too sure that there was one. Things were just&hellip;.wrong. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really long story, Mary. Everything&rsquo;s all kind of tangled together right now, and I don&rsquo;t want to take up your time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Daniel, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about me having anywhere else to be,&rdquo; she said, laughing a little before turning serious once again, &ldquo;but why don&rsquo;t you let me worry about that, alright? Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong, love.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan hesitated once again, but then he relented. He started from the beginning, and as soon as he started talking, it all came rushing out. Everything about the situations with Jaime&mdash;and even Phil&mdash;dribbled out of his mouth in a rambling, incohesive mess. Mary didn&rsquo;t interrupt him once, and she gave Dan all of his attention. By the end, Dan felt ten pounds lighter, but he also felt raw and kind of fragile. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you been talking to anyone else about this, or have you just been holding it all inside?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to my therapist, Gina, about the most of it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good, just you make sure that you start talking to her about all of it. It&rsquo;s not good to hold up the bad stuff inside our hearts because when you keep too much of it there too long it starts to make you sick.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m trying.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know you are, and I&rsquo;m proud of you. And in my experience, what Jaime&rsquo;s doing is something that people do an awful lot when they&rsquo;re in over their heads, which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at all because that&rsquo;s when we need each other the most. But sometimes people get scared or sad, or they&rsquo;re hurting, and they push others away. We&rsquo;re all guilty of it, and something tells me that right now, Jaime is scared or upset, and she&rsquo;s trying hard to deal with it all by herself. It&rsquo;s not healthy and she needs someone to help her see that, but you haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong, Daniel.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So you think I should show her that she should let people in?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if she was here, but it&rsquo;s horribly difficult to do it at such a distance.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan put his head in his hands and groaned. </p><p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s nothing I can do to fix this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Now I didn&rsquo;t say that. All you can do is wait right now and give her the space she wants. But once she starts to let you back in, make her feel welcome, and don&rsquo;t hold this against her. Be patient and let her know that you love her, and make sure to tell her that she doesn&rsquo;t have to face things alone. The only thing someone can do in a situation like this is to be there for the other person and let them know that they aren&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I just wish that none of this ever happened.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know hun,&rdquo; Mary said, patting Dan&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I know. Can I ask you something else?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, Mary.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Have you told Phil about you thinking about moving in with him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Dan grimaced. </p><p>&ldquo;I think you should, baby. He&rsquo;d be over the moon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But what if moving to London isn&rsquo;t the right decision?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What if things between us don&rsquo;t work out? Or if he doesn&rsquo;t want to move in with me? Or if my job doesn&rsquo;t work out, or a million other things. What if moving to London is a bad thing? I mean, I&rsquo;m fine here in Manchester. I have a flat and a job I can count on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Daniel, honey, every decision in your life is going to have a million possible bad things attached to it, but there are also a million good things too. What if this move brings you two closer? What if you find a place to work at that you love? Or what about how this move can ease your troubles over a long-distance relationship? You will never make a decision that doesn&rsquo;t have the potential to backfire, but you can&rsquo;t let that stop you. You can&rsquo;t let the fear of change stop you because then you&rsquo;ll stay put, and that&rsquo;s what I think you&rsquo;ve been doing. You&rsquo;re not meant to be a barista for your whole life, Daniel, and you aren&rsquo;t meant to stay in this job and that flat just because it&rsquo;s stable. One of the things about life is that you&rsquo;ve got to take risks sometimes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You think I should do it, then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think that you should think long and hard about it, and do what you&rsquo;re heart&rsquo;s telling you to do.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan nodded, his thoughts already a little distant. </p><p>He knew what his heart wanted. He didn&rsquo;t even really have to think about it, and he knew that Mary was right. </p><p>He just didn&rsquo;t know if he had the courage to do it. </p><p>~~~~~ </p><p>Dan slid his luggage under his chair before sitting next to the window. He put his earbuds in and pulled up a playlist that he had made a few days earlier for this exact trip. As the beginning melodies of the first song started to play, Dan rested his head against the glass. Everyone had stopped boarding the train at this point, and how they all just had to take their seats. </p><p>He vaguely heard the loudspeaker announce that the train would start moving&mdash;he really could only make out the sound of someone speaking over the music playing in his ears, but not any words&mdash;and a few moments later Dan felt as the train lurched forward. </p><p>It was kind of surreal to watch the station glide past him, and soon they were out of the city and chugging along the landscape. Trees and hills kept flying by to the soundtrack that was playing in Dan&rsquo;s ears, but Dan was tired, so he let his eyelids fall closed. </p><p>He was on his way to London for a few days. It wasn&rsquo;t permanent&mdash;only a visit&mdash;but Dan was still more than happy. He and Phil had been apart for just over three weeks now, and the distance was killing them both. </p><p>Dan still hadn&rsquo;t talked to Phil about moving in yet, but he was more than planning on doing it. He just needed a when, and probably a few other possible jobs to make sure that Dan would be able to have one lined up by the time that he moved in. London was expensive, and Dan knew that if they were going to make this work then they both had to be working. </p><p>The future still had so many possible outcomes, both good and bad, and Dan still had so many ideas of what he wanted to do. None of them were completely settled, but they were no longer flimsy, transparent daydreams. </p><p>With a little bit more time, Dan was sure that something would come out of them. </p><p>He had a few hours to go before he arrived in London, and Dan slumped a little bit more in the chair, his eyes still shut. It was late, he had just gotten off of work, and he was tired. </p><p>In his pocket, Dan felt his phone buzz, and he smiled, knowing that it was Phil texting him to probably let Dan know how excited he was. Dan didn&rsquo;t take his phone out to respond, he was too close to sleep for that, but he knew what he would say. And he knew that Phil knew too. </p><p><i>Me too, Phil,</i> he thought, <i>I&rsquo;m excited too. </i></p>",
