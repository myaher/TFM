Nobody ever got back to me about this little mystery, which is kind of a good thing because my answer would\u2019ve had to be \u201cdamn if I know\u201d. And it still is, but in a complicated way. :) But first, the text:</p><blockquote><p><small>The dead men had their own smell too. One of her duties was to find them in the temple every morning, wherever they had chosen to lie down and close their eyes after drinking from the pool.<br/>This morning she found two.<br/>One man had died at the feet of the Stranger, a single candle flickering above him. [\u2026] Before summoning the serving men to carry him away, she knelt and felt his face, tracing the line of his jaw, brushing her fingers across his cheeks and nose, touching his hair. Curly hair, and thick. A handsome face, unlined. He was young. She wondered what had brought him here to seek the gift of death. Dying bravos oft found their way to the House of Black and White, to hasten their ends, but this man had no wounds that she could find.<br/>The second body was that of an old woman. [\u2026] The corpses were laid out in the vault. The blind girl went to work in the dark, stripping the dead of boots and clothes and other possessions, emptying their purses and counting out their coins. [\u2026] On the handsome man she found four golden dragons out of Westeros. She was running the ball of her thumb across the most worn of them, trying to decide which king it showed, when she heard the door opening softly behind her.<br/></small></p><p><small>\u2013ADWD, The Blind Girl</small><br/></p></blockquote><p>OK, so the pool in the House of Black and White contains some kind of quick-acting painless poison, and people often come to the temple to drink it, for peaceful euthanasia. Usually old people, but sometimes deathly wounded bravos also do so\u2026 Arya encounters one when she first enters the HoBaW back in AFFC, for example.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>In this chapter, Arya is a blind novice in the temple, whose job it is to find these suicides and strip them of their possessions, before the bodies are taken into the secret lower sanctum of the temple. (Where presumably their faces are skinned off and prepared for use by the Faceless Men.) On this morning she finds a dead man, young and handsome, with thick curly hair. She thinks he\u2019s a bravo (one of the \nyoung aggressive swordsmen of Braavos who often duel each other), but can\u2019t find the wound that killed him.</p><p>But there\u2019s evidence that this man is not a mere bravo. First of all, he wasn\u2019t injured, but seems to have just committed suicide straight up. Secondly, Arya didn\u2019t find him by a statue of one of the death gods that the people of the Free Cities worship, but rather at the feet of <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/48176991806/have-you-ever-written-something-about-potential\">the Stranger, the Westerosi god of death</a>. (Though the Faith of the Seven originated in Essos, it is not really worshipped there anymore; there is a \u201cSept-Beyond-the-Sea\u201d in Braavos, but its only worshipers are visiting sailors.) Thirdly, Arya found Westerosi money in the dead man\u2019s purse. And not just a little bit of money, but <i>four golden dragons</i>, which is <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/169505685498/reading-your-anguy-question-how-much-money-was\">a nice chunk of change</a>. And fourthly, the fact that Arya\u2019s blind in this chapter is probably a clue that this man is recognizable somehow, but not to her and so not to us either. So who the hell is this guy?</p><p>And\u2026 well\u2026 we just don\u2019t know. People have speculated all kinds of random shit \u2013 thinking that the old woman is Old Nan (<a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/111945547078/i-dont-think-ive-ever-seen-anything-from-you\">no</a>), or Shella Whent (what, why) and the man is her guard, or Olenna Tyrell (???) and the young man is Loras (?????) \u2013 nothing that makes any sense, just illogical grasping at straws with no evidence to work with. There\u2019s nothing in the chapters before or after that help with identifying this man, nothing remotely decisive or even acting as the tiniest clue. The timeline doesn\u2019t work for the Westerosi heading to Braavos in ADWD/TWOW previews (Justin Massey, Harys Swyft), nor does it seem to fit any of those who we know went to Lys with Edric Storm. Symond Frey married a Braavosi girl, and his son Bradamyr is a ward of a Braavosi merchant, but Bradamyr is only ten years old. And Bradamyr\u2019s older brother, the singer Alesander, was \u201caway\u201d from the Red Wedding, but not to Braavos as far as we know.<br/></p><p>So\u2026 it is a mystery. Personally, I think that if GRRM has any intention of coming back to resolve this mystery, it\u2019ll probably be involved in Arya\u2019s eventual return to Westeros. This mysterious man\u2019s face has probably been turned into one of <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/114299792968/thanks-so-much-for-that-explanation-i-was-getting\">the Faceless Men\u2019s magic masks</a>, and Arya may take it whenever she chooses to leave the House. Furthermore, we know that when Arya puts on one of these faces she gets a brief flashback of that person\u2019s life and death (e.g. <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=%22A+terrible+sense+of+fear+filled+her%2C+and+she+heard+a+noise%2C+a+hideous+crunching+noise%2C+accompanied+by+blinding+pain.+A+face+floated+in+front+of+her%2C+fat%2C+bearded%2C+brutal%2C+his+mouth+twisted+with+rage.+%22&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;povs%5B%5D=Arya\">the ugly little girl</a>), so if she puts on this man\u2019s face, we may learn more about the mystery of who he is and why he came to Braavos and why he apparently killed himself.</p><p>But until then, alas\u2026 damn if I know. ;) Hope that helps!</p>",

Personally, I think that if GRRM has any intention of coming back to resolve this mystery, it\u2019ll probably be involved in Arya\u2019s eventual return to Westeros.

Furthermore, we know that when Arya puts on one of these faces she gets a brief flashback of that person\u2019s life and death (e.g. <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=%22A+terrible+sense+of+fear+filled+her%2C+and+she+heard+a+noise%2C+a+hideous+crunching+noise%2C+accompanied+by+blinding+pain.+A+face+floated+in+front+of+her%2C+fat%2C+bearded%2C+brutal%2C+his+mouth+twisted+with+rage.+%22&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;povs%5B%5D=Arya\">the ugly little girl</a>), so if she puts on this man\u2019s face, we may learn more about the mystery of who he is and why he came to Braavos and why he apparently killed himself.</p><p>But until then, alas\u2026 damn if I know. ;) Hope that helps!</p>",

Nobody ever got back to me about this little mystery, which is kind of a good thing because my answer would&rsquo;ve had to be &ldquo;damn if I know&rdquo;. And it still is, but in a complicated way. :) But first, the text:</p><blockquote><p><small>The dead men had their own smell too. One of her duties was to find them in the temple every morning, wherever they had chosen to lie down and close their eyes after drinking from the pool.<br />This morning she found two.<br />One man had died at the feet of the Stranger, a single candle flickering above him. [&hellip;] Before summoning the serving men to carry him away, she knelt and felt his face, tracing the line of his jaw, brushing her fingers across his cheeks and nose, touching his hair. Curly hair, and thick. A handsome face, unlined. He was young. She wondered what had brought him here to seek the gift of death. Dying bravos oft found their way to the House of Black and White, to hasten their ends, but this man had no wounds that she could find.<br />The second body was that of an old woman. [&hellip;] The corpses were laid out in the vault. The blind girl went to work in the dark, stripping the dead of boots and clothes and other possessions, emptying their purses and counting out their coins. [&hellip;] On the handsome man she found four golden dragons out of Westeros. She was running the ball of her thumb across the most worn of them, trying to decide which king it showed, when she heard the door opening softly behind her.<br /></small></p><p><small>&ndash;ADWD, The Blind Girl</small><br /></p></blockquote><p>OK, so the pool in the House of Black and White contains some kind of quick-acting painless poison, and people often come to the temple to drink it, for peaceful euthanasia. Usually old people, but sometimes deathly wounded bravos also do so&hellip; Arya encounters one when she first enters the HoBaW back in AFFC, for example.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>In this chapter, Arya is a blind novice in the temple, whose job it is to find these suicides and strip them of their possessions, before the bodies are taken into the secret lower sanctum of the temple. (Where presumably their faces are skinned off and prepared for use by the Faceless Men.) On this morning she finds a dead man, young and handsome, with thick curly hair.

They might have done well enough in the alleys of King&rsquo;s Landing, but out here they were lost. When she was being quiet as a shadow, she could sneak past all of them, flitting out by starlight to make her water in the woods where no one would see.

Please.</i>&rdquo; - Arya V, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>With Pinkeye awake, she dared not go back to her bed. Not knowing where else to hide, she made for the godswood.

A sheen of sweat covered her skin by the time she paused. The heel of her right foot was bloody where she&rsquo;d skinned it, so she stood one-legged before the <b>heart tree</b> and raised her sword in salute. &ldquo;Valar morghulis,&rdquo; she told the old gods of the north.</i>\u201d - Arya X, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>This postern was the least of Harrenhal&rsquo;s gates, a narrow door of stout <b>oak</b> studded with iron nails, set in an angle of the wall beneath a defensive tower</i>.\u201d - Arya X, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Outside the walls of Harrenhal, a wolf howled long and loud.

A sister? A wife? Tell me no lies, Squab. I buried Old Pate myself, right there under that <b>willow</b> where you were hiding, and you don&rsquo;t have his look.&ldquo; He drew a sad sound from his harp. &quot;We&rsquo;ve buried many a good man this past year, but we&rsquo;ve no wish to bury you, I swear it on my harp. Archer, show her.&quot;The archer&rsquo;s hand moved quicker than Arya would have believed. His shaft went hissing past her head within an inch of her ear and buried itself in the trunk of the <b>willow</b> behind her.</i>\u201d - Arya II, ASoS<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>There were woods to her left, she saw. I can lose them there. A dry ditch ran along one side of the field, but she leapt it without breaking stride, and plunged in among the stand of <b>elm and yew </b>and<b> birch trees</b>. A quick peek back showed Anguy and Harwin still hard on her heels. Greenbeard had fallen behind, though, and she could not see Lem at all. &quot;Faster,&rdquo; she told her horse, &ldquo;you can, you can.&quot;Between two <b>elms</b> she rode, and never paused to see which side the moss was growing on. She leapt a <b>rotten log</b> and swung wide around a monstrous <b>deadfall,</b> jagged with <b>broken branches</b></i>.\u201d - Arya III, ASoS<br/></p><p><i>&quot;I look like an <b>oak tree</b>, with all these stupid acorns.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nice, though.

Gendry and Cutjack dug her grave on a hillside beneath a weeping <b>willow</b>.</i>&rdquo; - Arya II, ACoK<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The land was gentle enough, rolling hills and terraced fields interspersed with meadows and woodlands and little valleys where <b>willows</b> crowded close to slow shallow streams</i>.&rdquo; - Arya III, ACoK<br /></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;<i>Once, in the middle of a dense stand of <b>oak</b>, they came face-to-face with three men pulling a load of firewood in an ox cart, with no way for either to get around. There had been nothing for it but to wait while the foresters unhitched their ox, led him through the trees, spun the cart, hitched the ox up again, and started back the way they&rsquo;d come. The ox was even slower than the wagons, so that day they hardly got anywhere at all.</i></p><p><i>Arya could not help looking over her shoulder, wondering when the gold cloaks would catch them. At night, she woke at every noise to grab for Needle&rsquo;s hilt. They never made camp without putting out sentries now, but Arya did not trust them, especially the orphan boys. They might have done well enough in the alleys of King&rsquo;s Landing, but out here they were lost. When she was being quiet as a shadow, she could sneak past all of them, flitting out by starlight to make her water in the woods where no one would see. Once, when Lommy Greenhands had the watch, she shimmied up an <b>oak</b> and moved from<b> tree </b>to <b>tree</b> until she was right above his head, and he never saw a thing.</i>&rdquo; - Arya III, ACoK<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Lommy Greenhands sat propped up between two thick roots at the foot of an <b>oak</b>. A spear had taken him through his left calf during the fight at the holdfast. By the end of the next day, he had to limp along one-legged with an arm around Gendry, and now he couldn&rsquo;t even do that. They&rsquo;d hacked <b>branches </b>off <b>trees</b> to make a litter for him, but it was slow, hard work carrying him along, and he whimpered every time they jounced him.</i>&rdquo; - Arya V, ACoK</p><p>&ldquo;<i>They found Lommy where they&rsquo;d left him, under the <b>oak</b>. &ldquo;I yield,&rdquo; he called out at once when he saw them. He&rsquo;d flung away his own spear and raised his hands, splotchy green with old dye. &ldquo;I yield. Please.</i>&rdquo; - Arya V, ACoK<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>With Pinkeye awake, she dared not go back to her bed. Not knowing where else to hide, she made for the godswood. She liked the sharp smell of the <b>pines </b>and <b>sentinels</b>, the feel of grass and dirt between her toes, and the sound the wind made in the leaves</i>.&rdquo; - Arya IX, ACoK&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>She slashed at <b>birch leaves </b>till the splintery point of the broken broomstick was green and sticky. &ldquo;Ser Gregor,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling.&rdquo; She spun and leapt and balanced on the balls of her feet, darting this way and that, knocking pinecones flying. &ldquo;The Tickler,&rdquo; she called out one time, &ldquo;the Hound,&rdquo; the next. &ldquo;Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei.&rdquo; The bole of an <b>oak</b> loomed before her, and she lunged to drive her point through it, grunting &ldquo;Joffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey.&rdquo; Her arms and legs were dappled by sunlight and the shadows of <b>leaves</b>. A sheen of sweat covered her skin by the time she paused. The heel of her right foot was bloody where she&rsquo;d skinned it, so she stood one-legged before the <b>heart tree</b> and raised her sword in salute. &ldquo;Valar morghulis,&rdquo; she told the old gods of the north.</i>&rdquo; - Arya X, ACoK<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>This postern was the least of Harrenhal&rsquo;s gates, a narrow door of stout <b>oak</b> studded with iron nails, set in an angle of the wall beneath a defensive tower</i>.&rdquo; - Arya X, ACoK<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Outside the walls of Harrenhal, a wolf howled long and loud. She lifted the bar, set it aside, and pulled open the heavy <b>oak</b> door</i>.&rdquo; - Arya X, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>It was no good arguing, Arya\nrealized; Gendry had the right of it. The Mummers will need to sleep too, she\ntold herself, hoping it was true. She was so weary it was a struggle even to\nget down from the saddle, but she remembered to hobble her horse before finding\na place beneath a&nbsp;<b>beech</b>&nbsp;<b>tree</b></i>.&rdquo; -\nArya I, ASoS</p><p>&ldquo;<i>They still had not seen so much as a glimpse of the sun. It was growing colder, and pale white mists were threading between the <b>pines</b> and blowing across the bare burned fields</i>.&rdquo; - Arya I, ASoS&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The&nbsp;<b>soldier</b>&nbsp;<b>pines</b>&nbsp;were dressed in somber greens, the\nbroadleafs in russets and faded golds already beginning to brown.&rdquo; -&nbsp;</i>Arya\nI, ASoS</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Lightfoot, she moved to the big old <b>willow</b> that grew beside the bend in the road and went to one knee in the grass and mud, within the veil of trailing branches.</i>&rdquo; - Arya II, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Two, then. Arya bit her lip. She could not see them from where she knelt, on account of the <b>willow</b>. But she could hear.&rdquo; - Arya II, ASoS<br /></p><p>\n\n&ldquo;<i>Now who are you?&rdquo; demanded Lem, in the deep voice that Arya had heard through the branches of the <b>willow</b></i>.&rdquo; - Arya II, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Are you Old Pate&rsquo;s daughter, then? A sister? A wife? Tell me no lies, Squab. I buried Old Pate myself, right there under that <b>willow</b> where you were hiding, and you don&rsquo;t have his look.&ldquo; He drew a sad sound from his harp. \"We&rsquo;ve buried many a good man this past year, but we&rsquo;ve no wish to bury you, I swear it on my harp. Archer, show her.\"The archer&rsquo;s hand moved quicker than Arya would have believed. His shaft went hissing past her head within an inch of her ear and buried itself in the trunk of the <b>willow</b> behind her.</i>&rdquo; - Arya II, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>There were woods to her left, she saw. I can lose them there. A dry ditch ran along one side of the field, but she leapt it without breaking stride, and plunged in among the stand of <b>elm and yew </b>and<b> birch trees</b>. A quick peek back showed Anguy and Harwin still hard on her heels. Greenbeard had fallen behind, though, and she could not see Lem at all. \"Faster,&rdquo; she told her horse, &ldquo;you can, you can.\"Between two <b>elms</b> she rode, and never paused to see which side the moss was growing on. She leapt a <b>rotten log</b> and swung wide around a monstrous <b>deadfall,</b> jagged with <b>broken branches</b></i>.&rdquo; - Arya III, ASoS<br /></p><p><i>\"I look like an <b>oak tree</b>, with all these stupid acorns.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nice, though. A nice <b>oak tree.</b>&rdquo; He stepped closer, and sniffed at her. &ldquo;You even smell nice for a change</i>.&rdquo; - Arya IV, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The dogs caught the scent. He was sleeping off a drunk under a <b>willow</b> tree, if you believe it.</i>&ldquo; - Arya VI, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Panting from exertion, Clegane jerked his shield up over his head just in time, and the cave rang with the loud crack of splintering <b>oak</b>.</i>&rdquo; - Arya VI, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>With a shout of revulsion, he hacked down savagely on the broken <b>oak</b>, completing its destruction.</i>&rdquo; - Arya VI, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Nor do they love the flames. For the <b>oak</b> recalls the acorn, the <b>acorn</b> dreams the <b>oak</b>, the <b>stump</b> lives in them both.</i>&rdquo; - Arya VIII, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>They sat on damp rocks beneath an <b>oak tree</b>, listening to the slow patter of water dripping from the<b> leaves</b> as they ate a cold supper of hardbread, moldy cheese, and smoked sausage</i>.&rdquo; - Arya IX, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>One day, in an earthen hollow made by the roots of a fallen <b>oak</b>, they came face to face with another survivor of the Twins</i>.&rdquo; - Arya XII, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>In the higher hills, they came upon a tiny isolated village surrounded\nby grey-green sentinels and tall blue&nbsp;<b>soldier</b>&nbsp;<b>pines</b>, and Clegane decided to risk going in.</i>&rdquo; -\nArya XII, ASoS</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Close by the water&rsquo;s edge, they found some <b>willows</b> rising from a jumble of weathered rocks. Together the rocks and <b>trees</b> formed a sort of natural fort where they could hide from both river and trail. \"Here will do,&rdquo; the Hound said. &ldquo;Water the horses and gather some deadwood for a fire.&rdquo; When he dismounted, he had to catch himself on a tree limb to keep from falling.</i>&rdquo; - Arya XIII, ASoS<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>There, where Denyo pointed, a line of stony ridges rose sudden from the sea, their steep slopes covered with <b>soldier</b> <b>pines</b> and <b>black spruce</b>.</i>&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The sound was as huge as he was, a terrible groaning and grinding, so loud it drowned out even the captain&rsquo;s voice and the crash of the waves against those <b>pine</b>-clad ridges.</i>&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The shadow lifted, the <b>pine</b>-clad ridges fell away to either side, the winds dwindled, and they found themselves moving through a great lagoon</i>.&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The scent was unfamiliar, and she put it down to some queer incense, but as she got deeper into the temple, they seemed to smell of snow and <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> and hot stew.</i>&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Winterfell, she might have said. I smell snow and smoke and <b>pine</b> needles.</i>&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC</p>",
