        "body": "<p>Dear people,</p><p>I consider myself a very lucky person. I&rsquo;ve gone to many concerts and conventions in my life. Mostly because my dad likes to bribe me with cool events. And at these concerts and conventions I&rsquo;ve met more celebrities and YouTubers than I care to count.  Some examples being Maroon 5 and Markiplier.</p><p>Meeting celebrities is something that any human being that isn&rsquo;t slightly psychotic has dreamt of at least once every month. I myself am only 1% psychotic so of course I dream of it a lot. About a wide variety of people. The most common one being Markiplier. I spent 3 years daydreaming of the day I could finally hug Mark.</p><p>Then, my world imploded. June 24th, 2017 I attended a convention called VidCon for the second time. At this convention, I finally met Mark! It was great. My hands were shaking, I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying, and when it was over I was fairly sure I was going to pass out.</p><p>This is basically a summary of every Meet and Greet I&rsquo;ve done. I cry, I shake, I sometimes faint. I can&rsquo;t even really explain why this happens. I like to think it&rsquo;s because I love them so much that my brain can&rsquo;t physically comprehend it.</p><p>The thing about meeting celebrities is it&rsquo;s bloody terrifying! I spend the month leading up to it having anxiety issues, because what if trip? What if I say something stupid? What if I THROW UP???</p><p>And right now I&rsquo;m going through all of this all over again. You see, next month, or more specifically in 18 days, I get to meet Dan and Phil. If you don&rsquo;t recognize those names, get on that shit right now man. They&rsquo;re the funniest people in the world.</p><p>But back to my point. I am absolutely petrified. I want to approach it with joy and excitement because I&rsquo;m so lucky to have this opportunity, but unfortunately my social anxiety and desperate need to be accepted is killing the mood a little bit. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am excited. But I&rsquo;m more scared. I&rsquo;m working through this with my therapist at the moment, and it&rsquo;s not helping at all.</p><p>When you meet your favorite celebrities, a common theme among the fan is wanting said celebrity to like them. You want them to like you, to accept you, to think you&rsquo;re funny. I get that to an unhealthy degree. I sit in the shower and plan out my meetup conversation word for word. However, this is impossible to truly plan because I have no idea how Dan or Phil will react to what I say. So I can&rsquo;t anticipate any of the conversation past my first sentence.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;ll be calm and collected, but we can all be pretty sure that&rsquo;s not true. At all. Going off of past examples, I&rsquo;m gonna fucking cry my eyes out. Which I suppose isn&rsquo;t that traumatizing or embarrassing. It could be at lot worse. I could just pass the fuck out in their arms.

            "comment": "<p>Dear people,</p><p>I consider myself a very lucky person. I\u2019ve gone to many concerts and conventions in my life. Mostly because my dad likes to bribe me with cool events. And at these concerts and conventions I\u2019ve met more celebrities and YouTubers than I care to count.  Some examples being Maroon 5 and Markiplier.</p><p>Meeting celebrities is something that any human being that isn\u2019t slightly psychotic has dreamt of at least once every month. I myself am only 1% psychotic so of course I dream of it a lot. About a wide variety of people. The most common one being Markiplier. I spent 3 years daydreaming of the day I could finally hug Mark.</p><p>Then, my world imploded. June 24th, 2017 I attended a convention called VidCon for the second time. At this convention, I finally met Mark! It was great. My hands were shaking, I couldn\u2019t stop crying, and when it was over I was fairly sure I was going to pass out.</p><p>This is basically a summary of every Meet and Greet I\u2019ve done. I cry, I shake, I sometimes faint. I can\u2019t even really explain why this happens. I like to think it\u2019s because I love them so much that my brain can\u2019t physically comprehend it.</p><p>The thing about meeting celebrities is it\u2019s bloody terrifying! I spend the month leading up to it having anxiety issues, because what if trip? What if I say something stupid? What if I THROW UP???</p><p>And right now I\u2019m going through all of this all over again. You see, next month, or more specifically in 18 days, I get to meet Dan and Phil. If you don\u2019t recognize those names, get on that shit right now man. They\u2019re the funniest people in the world.</p><p>But back to my point. I am absolutely petrified. I want to approach it with joy and excitement because I\u2019m so lucky to have this opportunity, but unfortunately my social anxiety and desperate need to be accepted is killing the mood a little bit. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am excited. But I\u2019m more scared. I\u2019m working through this with my therapist at the moment, and it\u2019s not helping at all.</p><p>When you meet your favorite celebrities, a common theme among the fan is wanting said celebrity to like them. You want them to like you, to accept you, to think you\u2019re funny. I get that to an unhealthy degree. I sit in the shower and plan out my meetup conversation word for word. However, this is impossible to truly plan because I have no idea how Dan or Phil will react to what I say. So I can\u2019t anticipate any of the conversation past my first sentence.</p><p>I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ll be calm and collected, but we can all be pretty sure that\u2019s not true. At all. Going off of past examples, I\u2019m gonna fucking cry my eyes out. Which I suppose isn\u2019t that traumatizing or embarrassing. It could be at lot worse. I could just pass the fuck out in their arms. However, even as I type this, my breathing is getting erratic.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d take a moment to remind anyone who doesn\u2019t know, that at this convention I am also meeting Thomas Sanders and The Try Guys.

Even if I trip, or maybe I say the wrong word, they&rsquo;ll probably just find it endearing.</p><p>Me being convinced that they&rsquo;ll hate me no matter what relates back to something different.</p><p>Self hatred.</p><p>See, if I don&rsquo;t like myself, how can I possibly assume that Dan and Phil will like me? I find myself irritating and ugly. So of course my natural assumption is that Dan and Phil will find me irritating and ugly. I can&rsquo;t fathom someone thinking I&rsquo;m funny. Or pretty. That&rsquo;s just ridiculous. I mean obviously everything is subjective. Something I find annoying, my sister might think is the funniest thing she&rsquo;s ever heard. Someone I find beautiful, she might find ugly and gross.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Harry Styles. I think Harry Styles is one of the most handsome men on Earth at the moment. But my sister, Hannah, thinks he&rsquo;s ugly. (Btw fuck you Hannah he&rsquo;s gorgeous) You may know the common quote, &ldquo;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p><p>It&rsquo;s highly possible, if not probable, that Dan and Phil will find me endearing and funny. Because I&rsquo;m very biased. I&rsquo;ve never met a person that didn&rsquo;t hate themselves. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that I&rsquo;m one of those people.</p><p>The point of this post is to say that social anxiety and self hatred are shitty. And they can be scary and hard to deal with. But we can&rsquo;t let them hold us back. I refuse to let my anxiety stop me from doing something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for four years.</p><p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say, is that despite our struggles, we have to work through them so we can live life the way we&rsquo;re supposed to. Happy, and outside our homes.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>B</p>",

Dan looked hot, for lack of a better word. His cute curly hair had a pastel pink flower crown on top, to match that he had a pastel oversized jumper tucked into a short white skirt. However, the gap between Dans thigh high socks and the hem of his skirt is what caught Phils eye the most. Fuck. Phil knew Dan wore pastel clothes, he\u2019d been to the boys house before, but he didn\u2019t know he wore <i>this</i>. </p><p>The pastel boy rubbed his soft thighs together as he locked his chocolate eyes with Phils icy blue ones. Phil could\u2019ve melted in that boys eyes. </p><p>\u201cHey Phil\u201d Dan replied softly, admiring Phils all black outfit.</p><p>\u201cCan I, uh, come in?\u201d Phil rasped. Dan replied with a soft \u2018mhmm\u2019, refusing to meet Phils eyes. Phil was seriously going to melt, this boy was just so adorable.  </p><p>Dan watched as Phil entered. Phils adam\u2019s apple moved slightly as he swallowed his newfound nerves, Dans thoughts began to go rogue after seeing that. Dan loved Phils piercings, he had 4 piercings on each ear, an eyebrow piercing and snakebites, very much contrasting to the pair of small silver hoops Dan had in his own ears. Dan wanted nothing more but to stare and nip at those piercings and to feel them against his own skin. </p><p> Phil followed Dan up the stairs removing his leather jacket as he went. When Dan had plopped onto his soft  Queen sized bed he had a chance to take in Phil properly. Tattoos crept from underneath Phils shirt and up his neck, they also seemed to crawl down his arms and that\u2019s when Dan found himself entranced in Phils biceps. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Phil said now sitting opposite Dan, watching Dan stare lovingly at him. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dan squeaked. \u201coh\u201d he said, realising he\u2019d been caught. </p><p>\u201cYou look great by the way&hellip;\u201d Phil said almost awkwardly, biting his snakebites. Dan instantly turned red and hid his face in his hands. He forgot he was wearing that. </p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m gonna go change wait a minute\u201d he said tearing up, he couldn\u2019t control his nerves especially since it was Phil. Here\u2019s a secret, Dan has had a crush on Phil for quite a while now but Dan has been too scared to say anything. He didn\u2019t know if Phil was even remotely interested in boys nevermind him. </p><p>As Dan got up to change Phil grabbed his hand and pulled him back down, making him fall backwards into Phils lap. Dan stared innocently into Phils eyes before realising what had just happened. He hid his face in his hands again. God why was there so much embarrassment today!</p><p>\u201cIm serious Dan\u201d Phil said gently, removing Dans hands from his face and stroking Dans cheek, \u201cYou look amazing\u201d </p><p>It was safe to say Dans heart was going crazy. He couldn\u2019t even feel Phils hand on his face because it had gone numb from the sudden rush of blood.</p><p>\u201cPiss off\u201d Dan murmered, still incredibly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNo Daniel, you seriously look beautiful\u201d Phil said, picking Dan up and holding him against his chest. Dans body was so soft and small compared to his, Phil thought that if he pressed any harder Dan would break.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so bad yourself\u201d Dan whispered, looking down, refusing to make any eyecontact.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that Daniel?\u201d Phil said, lifting Dans chin up with his fingers. Phil didn\u2019t know what he was feeling, he was horny, in love and flustered all at once and he was sure Dan could tell since he was right on Phils lap. </p><p>Dan knew that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to say that again so without thinking he went and left a soft peck on Phils cheek. Phil very nearly almost squealed. This boy was seriously something else. Phil returned the favour to which Dan hid his face in Phils neck. At least it wasn\u2019t his hands this time. Phil noticed that Dans face was really soft and it made him wonder if that was true for everything else, but he stopped himself from ruining such a pure moment. </p><p>Phil stroked Dans hair gently. \u201cYou really are adorable\u201d he chuckled. </p>",

                "content": "<p><h1>Adorable (Drabble)</h1><p>Pairing: Punk!Phil x Pastel!Dan (AU)</p><p>Warnings: Fluff, sexual tension, gay obviously, fem clothing, insecurity, thighs!, piercings </p><p>Summary: Dan and Phil being in love </p><p>Note: I needed to write this bc I don&rsquo;t see it enough and I love this au + I&rsquo;m not assuming anything about Dan or Phil and I respect their privacy this is <i>entirely fiction </i></p><p>If you&rsquo;ve never got mixed feeelings from a fan fiction before well this is the one that will change everything </p><p>-</p><p>Dan loved wearing pastel. Pastel skirts, pastel jeans, pastel crop tops, pastel flower crowns&hellip; you get the idea. As much as he loved it, there was a catch. He could only bring himself to wear it at home and very nearly had panic attacks whenever someone saw him, which was why when Phil Lester showed up on his doorstep he almost pissed his white skirt. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Daniel&rdquo; Phil breathed, running his hand through his already slicked back hair. Dan looked hot, for lack of a better word. His cute curly hair had a pastel pink flower crown on top, to match that he had a pastel oversized jumper tucked into a short white skirt. However, the gap between Dans thigh high socks and the hem of his skirt is what caught Phils eye the most. Fuck. Phil knew Dan wore pastel clothes, he&rsquo;d been to the boys house before, but he didn&rsquo;t know he wore <i>this</i>. </p><p>The pastel boy rubbed his soft thighs together as he locked his chocolate eyes with Phils icy blue ones. Phil could&rsquo;ve melted in that boys eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Phil&rdquo; Dan replied softly, admiring Phils all black outfit.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I, uh, come in?&rdquo; Phil rasped. Dan replied with a soft &lsquo;mhmm&rsquo;, refusing to meet Phils eyes. Phil was seriously going to melt, this boy was just so adorable.  </p><p>Dan watched as Phil entered. Phils adam&rsquo;s apple moved slightly as he swallowed his newfound nerves, Dans thoughts began to go rogue after seeing that. Dan loved Phils piercings, he had 4 piercings on each ear, an eyebrow piercing and snakebites, very much contrasting to the pair of small silver hoops Dan had in his own ears. Dan wanted nothing more but to stare and nip at those piercings and to feel them against his own skin. </p><p> Phil followed Dan up the stairs removing his leather jacket as he went. When Dan had plopped onto his soft  Queen sized bed he had a chance to take in Phil properly. Tattoos crept from underneath Phils shirt and up his neck, they also seemed to crawl down his arms and that&rsquo;s when Dan found himself entranced in Phils biceps. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; Phil said now sitting opposite Dan, watching Dan stare lovingly at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Dan squeaked. &ldquo;oh&rdquo; he said, realising he&rsquo;d been caught. </p><p>&ldquo;You look great by the way&hellip;&rdquo; Phil said almost awkwardly, biting his snakebites. Dan instantly turned red and hid his face in his hands. He forgot he was wearing that. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m gonna go change wait a minute&rdquo; he said tearing up, he couldn&rsquo;t control his nerves especially since it was Phil. Here&rsquo;s a secret, Dan has had a crush on Phil for quite a while now but Dan has been too scared to say anything. He didn&rsquo;t know if Phil was even remotely interested in boys nevermind him. </p><p>As Dan got up to change Phil grabbed his hand and pulled him back down, making him fall backwards into Phils lap. Dan stared innocently into Phils eyes before realising what had just happened. He hid his face in his hands again. God why was there so much embarrassment today!</p><p>&ldquo;Im serious Dan&rdquo; Phil said gently, removing Dans hands from his face and stroking Dans cheek, &ldquo;You look amazing&rdquo; </p><p>It was safe to say Dans heart was going crazy. He couldn&rsquo;t even feel Phils hand on his face because it had gone numb from the sudden rush of blood.</p><p>&ldquo;Piss off&rdquo; Dan murmered, still incredibly embarrassed.</p><p>&ldquo;No Daniel, you seriously look beautiful&rdquo; Phil said, picking Dan up and holding him against his chest. Dans body was so soft and small compared to his, Phil thought that if he pressed any harder Dan would break.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look so bad yourself&rdquo; Dan whispered, looking down, refusing to make any eyecontact.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that Daniel?&rdquo; Phil said, lifting Dans chin up with his fingers.

While I don't necessarily agree I can see his point. I do not make the choice to be happy, but I surround myself with creative people, look and discuss things that inspire me and drink far too much coffee to keep me buzzing and productive. Happiness, to me, is being able to eat breakfast at any time of the day.",
