Look at them, they are climbing the side of the building trying to break in. I call this a step down from our other missions,\u201d you said in your ear comm. Fury wanted you and Tony to take care of this problem before it escalated into something worse, but how much worse could it get?<br/></p><p>\u201cWould you just focus?\u201d Tony asked as he did a once over around the building. He got the easy job; all he was good for was flying and FRIDAY.</p><p>\u201cCome on, they\u2019re common thieves. We should let PD handle this. Let\u2019s just call them and go back to the tower,\u201d you complained, watching as the two thieves continued to climb.</p><p>\u201cY/N, focus! Seriously!\u201d Tony snapped.</p><p>\u201cUh, boss?\u201d FRIDAY said from both ear comms. Tony made it possible for you to hear her in your ear as well as in his suit. He trusted you enough to let you in on the potential dangers.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWhat is it, FRIDAY?\u201d you asked the AI.</p><p>\u201cThey have a bomb on them that is powerful enough to level the city. The higher they go, the more fatalities there will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, now I see the problem,\u201d you spoke and sighed.</p><p>\u201cY/N, can you get a clear shot?\u201d your boyfriend asked. Raising your specialized gun, you smirked as you locked onto the target.</p><p>\u201cDo I ever miss?\u201d Currently, you are the best markswoman known to man. There isn\u2019t a target you can\u2019t hit, and almost everyone wanted you to do their dirty work. You have superhuman like senses that allow you to see the world through a different eye. There was one time that you were able to hit a target that Tony was flying around at top speed with your eyes closed. Not being able to miss is a given due to your skills.</p><p>The only special thing about you was the serum you got when Steve had gotten his. The only thing it provided you with was that it could slow down your aging. It gave you a longer lifespan to get your dirty work done. You and Steve had been the ultimate fighting couple before he went under. After he resurfaced, things seemed to pick up right where they left off. However, when he surfaced, your heart belonged to Tony. Now, it was you and Tony who was the ultimate fighting couple.</p><p>\u201cI would advise against that Miss Y/L/N,\u201d FRIDAY spoke up.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d you asked as you kept your target locked.</p><p>\u201cOne hit and that bomb <g class=\"gr_ gr_785 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"785\" data-gr-id=\"785\">goes</g> off. Either way, the city is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are we supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to them. They\u2019re a couple of kids. FRIDAY get Wanda here. She can contain the blast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, what are you doing?\u201d you asked in a slight panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony don\u2019t you dare!\u201d you exclaimed just as he went off the air. \u201cFUCK!\u201d Looking around for a way to the roof, you couldn\u2019t help but feel eyes on you. Whoever was watching you, you knew they didn\u2019t have good intentions.</p><p>\u201cTony, please answer me,\u201d you said into your ear comm. When you received no answer, that is when you started to panic. The kids made it to the roof of the building they were climbing, and you started to walk to the entrance of the building. If breaking the door down means helping Tony, then you were going to do just that. As soon as you rounded the corner, paid started spreading from your side. Looking down, you saw a pool of blood growing from where the pain was. On the ground next to you was a bullet. Whoever shot you must have the world\u2019s quietest gun because you didn\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>Your legs wobbled in protest, and you fell to the ground. Your mind finally caught up with what was happening, and you cried out in pain as you clutched your side. Tony wasn\u2019t answering, someone shot you, and kids might blow up the entire fucking city. What else could go wrong?</p><p>\u201cY/N are you there?\u201d Tony spoke through the comm.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here,\u201d you said as evenly as you possibly could. There was no way you were going to tell Tony that you were just shot. It was his idea to leave you on the ground since he thought you could get a better shot from down there even though you told him you could get a shot from anywhere. He would be overridden with guilt, and you didn&rsquo;t need that. As long as you got to the tower, you could patch this up yourself.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? I got the kids to give me the bomb. Wanda and Vision are here now. They are going to take these kids to PD. Where are you? We\u2019re going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the ground,\u201d you said as you mentally slapped yourself. Tony could not see what had happened to you. Luckily for you, your jacket was dark and could cover up the color of blood. With all the strength you had, you forced yourself to get up. Your hands were shaky, your skin was pale, and your breathing was ragged. It would take a lot of power to try and convince your boyfriend that nothing was wrong with you.</p><p>Taking off your jacket, you wiped the blood off your hands before tying it around your waist, making sure to put pressure on the wound. All you wanted to do was scream at the top of your lungs and cry, but when you saw the Quinjet, you forced those feelings deep inside you. When Tony landed the bird, you immediately got on. Tony then had FRIDAY take you back to the tower on autopilot.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d he asked as he placed the bomb carefully in a glass protector case.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded curtly before walking away from him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, you\u2019re looking a little pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Tony. Really. I just need silence, please,\u201d you pleaded, hoping he would give you what you wanted. If you talked anymore, your voice might give you away.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he sighed as he walked back to the pilot\u2019s seat. As soon as he turned away from you, a tear rolled down your cheek.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>The first thing you did when Tony landed the bird back at the tower was rush to the nearest bathroom. He didn\u2019t question a thing but stayed back to make sure the bomb was safely carried inside, and to check to make sure the Quinjet was okay before shutting her off.</p><p>Slamming the bathroom door shut, you let out a small whimper of pain before taking off your jacket. The pain in your side had shot up to your arm, causing it to hurt with the slightest bit of movement. So, you tried your best to peel off your shirt with one hand. As soon as it was off, you dropped it to the floor and watched as buckets of blood began to pour from your wounds. There <g class=\"gr_ gr_883 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"883\" data-gr-id=\"883\">was</g> an enter and exit hole from where the bullet traveled.</p><p>Grabbing Tony\u2019s nice white towels, you placed one over your wounds to try and get the bleeding to stop, but that only made the towel turn red. The blood would not stop flowing, and you were sure that you would die from blood loss if the bleeding didn&rsquo;t stop anytime soon. Your skin was pasty white, your hands shook from the pain, and your head started to feel dizzy. As you reached for the second towel hanging from the rack, your hand slipped, and you fell to the ground. There wasn\u2019t enough strength in you to get up, and there was no way to contact Tony to come and help you.</p><p>There was only you.</p><p>Tony had just finished checking some things off when he noticed a small pool of blood from where you were sitting the whole time. He looked on the landing and saw a few smaller pools of blood, and he immediately knew something was wrong. Dropping whatever he had in his hand, he followed the trails of blood to the bathroom. In your busy mind, you forgot to lock the bathroom so Tony was able to get in easily.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t like what he saw.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY! Call an ambulance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cY/N, wake up,\u201d he panicked, looking at your wound which was still gushing blood. He grabbed a clean towel from the rack and placed it over the wounds with immense pressure to get the bleeding to stop.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Please!\u201d</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>The pain in your side was still there, but it didn\u2019t hurt as much as it did before. All you could hear was the beeping coming from your heart monitor and Tony who was pacing the floor of your hospital room.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d you whispered when you opened your eyes. He immediately came to your side and took your hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I was stupid. Someone shot me, and I didn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t see them. I didn\u2019t hear it\u2026 I didn\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d you took deep breaths between each pause.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you half dead on the bathroom floor made me worry. I\u2019ll find out who did this to you, but please, don\u2019t ever hide this from me. You lost a lot of blood and you weren&rsquo;t waking up. You fucking scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay now. The wounds are closed and your blood is staying right where it belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said before kissing your forehead.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>\u201cDid you do it? Did you complete your mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. I shot and killed Y/N Y/L/N,\u201d Bucky said in a monotone voice.</p><p>\u201cYou sure she is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched her take her last breath myself,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. You\u2019ll make a fine soldier when we\u2019re finished with you,\u201d one of HYDRA\u2019s personnel smiled wickedly. Bucky looked up at the man who had been experimenting on him from the beginning. His mission was to kill you, but for some reason, he only grazed your side. HYDRA can mess with his head all they want, but they can never erase the memory of you from his brain. The memories of the two of you together, being happy. He could never kill the love of his life, no matter how much they fuck with his brain.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>If you want to be tagged, add yourself to <b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1loroENIL02JGGewSW98VZtyN9KafcYFdhYcLat6MPHQ%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;t=MGFlYjI1MTFkYTQwMjc3ODA5ZjJlMGZlMzIxNjRjYjliYWZkYjRiNyxUbjFUTWx3YQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AfQpgf-Pc8j8gQyXeP5Nx8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fqueen-of-the-avengers.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175535300947%2Fdealing-with-the-big-problems\">this document</a>! </b>If your tag doesn\u2019t work,<b> <b><a href=\"https://queen-of-deans-booty.tumblr.com/post/168949327179/no-mention-zone-tumblr\">find out why</a>!</b></b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDpk9mxC3Vgp2KzH4hBUpuQ\">@likiyoshi-lijie</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCYBx_h35wOHSanz-KWYkSA\">@gh0stgurl</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\">@until-theend-oftheline</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWUBifNx_ALnyYf8QCGl6iw\">@2dreamcatcher8</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\">@linkpk88</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt0NDolFnGpUbdpRp-oLMzw\">@vvishous</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmSaWtNBYURkXYyTE4SQkQ\">@bemyqueenofdarkness</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6Il-apMbZXtrCjcwn6WzfQ\">@wittysunflower</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvnpbr0FaZJZ_2Yegj-CqQA\">@thejourneyneverendsx</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\">@cutelittlepurplesouls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\">@feelmyroarrrr</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB1mtlcXR1DSj6i8V_2-9uw\">@rayvenrider</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkDfcQ0-g2bBphYR6LZA8pA\">@xxloki81xx</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVIjDeqbeldSeiZd2oLMTFA\">@fandomgirl17</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m74Ud3okbnh6kIxrze1jbpQ\">@fatbottomedgeek</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHq62L049STfdlTXHEJk0lA\">@ivvitm1109</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte4aYh4BCFhSdnNIECKQAg\">@kendall-michele</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq79fl6uHP0Ayz65mPxhdAQ\">@niall2017</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrXIpJO9dREEMnm0CDm8TjA\">@schwankyblock</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKDwbu6idiycGZPI41sQ31g\">@fuckthatfeeling</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJp1hVuE-ruMYnLeUvhioLg\">@tardis-is-mine</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhq72MIcEjvxGR30ZHPmvgQ\">@kpoplover1306-depressedgirl315</a></p>",

There isn\u2019t a target you can\u2019t hit, and almost everyone wanted you to do their dirty work. You have superhuman like senses that allow you to see the world through a different eye.

Call an ambulance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cY/N, wake up,\u201d he panicked, looking at your wound which was still gushing blood. He grabbed a clean towel from the rack and placed it over the wounds with immense pressure to get the bleeding to stop.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Please!\u201d</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>The pain in your side was still there, but it didn\u2019t hurt as much as it did before. All you could hear was the beeping coming from your heart monitor and Tony who was pacing the floor of your hospital room.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d you whispered when you opened your eyes. He immediately came to your side and took your hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I was stupid. Someone shot me, and I didn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t see them. I didn\u2019t hear it\u2026 I didn\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d you took deep breaths between each pause.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you half dead on the bathroom floor made me worry. I\u2019ll find out who did this to you, but please, don\u2019t ever hide this from me. You lost a lot of blood and you weren\u2019t waking up. You fucking scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay now. The wounds are closed and your blood is staying right where it belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said before kissing your forehead.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>\u201cDid you do it? Did you complete your mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. I shot and killed Y/N Y/L/N,\u201d Bucky said in a monotone voice.</p><p>\u201cYou sure she is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched her take her last breath myself,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. You\u2019ll make a fine soldier when we\u2019re finished with you,\u201d one of HYDRA\u2019s personnel smiled wickedly. Bucky looked up at the man who had been experimenting on him from the beginning. His mission was to kill you, but for some reason, he only grazed your side. HYDRA can mess with his head all they want, but they can never erase the memory of you from his brain. The memories of the two of you together, being happy. He could never kill the love of his life, no matter how much they fuck with his brain.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>If you want to be tagged, add yourself to <b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1loroENIL02JGGewSW98VZtyN9KafcYFdhYcLat6MPHQ%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;t=MGFlYjI1MTFkYTQwMjc3ODA5ZjJlMGZlMzIxNjRjYjliYWZkYjRiNyxUbjFUTWx3YQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AfQpgf-Pc8j8gQyXeP5Nx8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fqueen-of-the-avengers.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175535300947%2Fdealing-with-the-big-problems\">this document</a>! </b>If your tag doesn\u2019t work,<b> <b><a href=\"https://queen-of-deans-booty.tumblr.com/post/168949327179/no-mention-zone-tumblr\">find out why</a>!</b></b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDpk9mxC3Vgp2KzH4hBUpuQ\">@likiyoshi-lijie</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCYBx_h35wOHSanz-KWYkSA\">@gh0stgurl</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\">@until-theend-oftheline</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWUBifNx_ALnyYf8QCGl6iw\">@2dreamcatcher8</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\">@linkpk88</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt0NDolFnGpUbdpRp-oLMzw\">@vvishous</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmSaWtNBYURkXYyTE4SQkQ\">@bemyqueenofdarkness</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6Il-apMbZXtrCjcwn6WzfQ\">@wittysunflower</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvnpbr0FaZJZ_2Yegj-CqQA\">@thejourneyneverendsx</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\">@cutelittlepurplesouls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\">@feelmyroarrrr</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB1mtlcXR1DSj6i8V_2-9uw\">@rayvenrider</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkDfcQ0-g2bBphYR6LZA8pA\">@xxloki81xx</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVIjDeqbeldSeiZd2oLMTFA\">@fandomgirl17</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m74Ud3okbnh6kIxrze1jbpQ\">@fatbottomedgeek</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHq62L049STfdlTXHEJk0lA\">@ivvitm1109</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte4aYh4BCFhSdnNIECKQAg\">@kendall-michele</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq79fl6uHP0Ayz65mPxhdAQ\">@niall2017</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrXIpJO9dREEMnm0CDm8TjA\">@schwankyblock</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKDwbu6idiycGZPI41sQ31g\">@fuckthatfeeling</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJp1hVuE-ruMYnLeUvhioLg\">@tardis-is-mine</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhq72MIcEjvxGR30ZHPmvgQ\">@kpoplover1306-depressedgirl315</a></p>",

Look at them, they are climbing the side of the building trying to break in. I call this a step down from our other missions,\u201d you said in your ear comm. Fury wanted you and Tony to take care of this problem before it escalated into something worse, but how much worse could it get?<br></p><p>\u201cWould you just focus?\u201d Tony asked as he did a once over around the building. He got the easy job; all he was good for was flying and FRIDAY.</p><p>\u201cCome on, they\u2019re common thieves. We should let PD handle this. Let\u2019s just call them and go back to the tower,\u201d you complained, watching as the two thieves continued to climb.</p><p>\u201cY/N, focus! Seriously!\u201d Tony snapped.</p><p>\u201cUh, boss?\u201d FRIDAY said from both ear comms. Tony made it possible for you to hear her in your ear as well as in his suit. He trusted you enough to let you in on the potential dangers.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhat is it, FRIDAY?\u201d you asked the AI.</p><p>\u201cThey have a bomb on them that is powerful enough to level the city. The higher they go, the more fatalities there will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, now I see the problem,\u201d you spoke and sighed.</p><p>\u201cY/N, can you get a clear shot?\u201d your boyfriend asked. Raising your specialized gun, you smirked as you locked onto the target.</p><p>\u201cDo I ever miss?\u201d Currently, you are the best markswoman known to man. There isn\u2019t a target you can\u2019t hit, and almost everyone wanted you to do their dirty work. You have superhuman like senses that allow you to see the world through a different eye. There was one time that you were able to hit a target that Tony was flying around at top speed with your eyes closed. Not being able to miss is a given due to your skills.</p><p>The only special thing about you was the serum you got when Steve had gotten his. The only thing it provided you with was that it could slow down your aging. It gave you a longer lifespan to get your dirty work done. You and Steve had been the ultimate fighting couple before he went under. After he resurfaced, things seemed to pick up right where they left off. However, when he surfaced, your heart belonged to Tony. Now, it was you and Tony who was the ultimate fighting couple.</p><p>\u201cI would advise against that Miss Y/L/N,\u201d FRIDAY spoke up.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d you asked as you kept your target locked.</p><p>\u201cOne hit and that bomb <g class=\"gr_ gr_785 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"785\" data-gr-id=\"785\">goes</g> off. Either way, the city is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are we supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to them. They\u2019re a couple of kids. FRIDAY get Wanda here. She can contain the blast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, what are you doing?\u201d you asked in a slight panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony don\u2019t you dare!\u201d you exclaimed just as he went off the air. \u201cFUCK!\u201d Looking around for a way to the roof, you couldn\u2019t help but feel eyes on you. Whoever was watching you, you knew they didn\u2019t have good intentions.</p><p>\u201cTony, please answer me,\u201d you said into your ear comm. When you received no answer, that is when you started to panic. The kids made it to the roof of the building they were climbing, and you started to walk to the entrance of the building. If breaking the door down means helping Tony, then you were going to do just that. As soon as you rounded the corner, paid started spreading from your side. Looking down, you saw a pool of blood growing from where the pain was. On the ground next to you was a bullet. Whoever shot you must have the world\u2019s quietest gun because you didn\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>Your legs wobbled in protest, and you fell to the ground. Your mind finally caught up with what was happening, and you cried out in pain as you clutched your side. Tony wasn\u2019t answering, someone shot you, and kids might blow up the entire fucking city. What else could go wrong?</p><p>\u201cY/N are you there?\u201d Tony spoke through the comm.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here,\u201d you said as evenly as you possibly could. There was no way you were going to tell Tony that you were just shot. It was his idea to leave you on the ground since he thought you could get a better shot from down there even though you told him you could get a shot from anywhere. He would be overridden with guilt, and you didn\u2019t need that. As long as you got to the tower, you could patch this up yourself.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? I got the kids to give me the bomb. Wanda and Vision are here now. They are going to take these kids to PD. Where are you? We\u2019re going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the ground,\u201d you said as you mentally slapped yourself. Tony could not see what had happened to you. Luckily for you, your jacket was dark and could cover up the color of blood. With all the strength you had, you forced yourself to get up. Your hands were shaky, your skin was pale, and your breathing was ragged. It would take a lot of power to try and convince your boyfriend that nothing was wrong with you.</p><p>Taking off your jacket, you wiped the blood off your hands before tying it around your waist, making sure to put pressure on the wound. All you wanted to do was scream at the top of your lungs and cry, but when you saw the Quinjet, you forced those feelings deep inside you. When Tony landed the bird, you immediately got on. Tony then had FRIDAY take you back to the tower on autopilot.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d he asked as he placed the bomb carefully in a glass protector case.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you nodded curtly before walking away from him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, you\u2019re looking a little pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Tony. Really. I just need silence, please,\u201d you pleaded, hoping he would give you what you wanted. If you talked anymore, your voice might give you away.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he sighed as he walked back to the pilot\u2019s seat. As soon as he turned away from you, a tear rolled down your cheek.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>The first thing you did when Tony landed the bird back at the tower was rush to the nearest bathroom. He didn\u2019t question a thing but stayed back to make sure the bomb was safely carried inside, and to check to make sure the Quinjet was okay before shutting her off.</p><p>Slamming the bathroom door shut, you let out a small whimper of pain before taking off your jacket. The pain in your side had shot up to your arm, causing it to hurt with the slightest bit of movement. So, you tried your best to peel off your shirt with one hand. As soon as it was off, you dropped it to the floor and watched as buckets of blood began to pour from your wounds. There <g class=\"gr_ gr_883 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"883\" data-gr-id=\"883\">was</g> an enter and exit hole from where the bullet traveled.</p><p>Grabbing Tony\u2019s nice white towels, you placed one over your wounds to try and get the bleeding to stop, but that only made the towel turn red. The blood would not stop flowing, and you were sure that you would die from blood loss if the bleeding didn\u2019t stop anytime soon. Your skin was pasty white, your hands shook from the pain, and your head started to feel dizzy. As you reached for the second towel hanging from the rack, your hand slipped, and you fell to the ground. There wasn\u2019t enough strength in you to get up, and there was no way to contact Tony to come and help you.</p><p>There was only you.</p><p>Tony had just finished checking some things off when he noticed a small pool of blood from where you were sitting the whole time. He looked on the landing and saw a few smaller pools of blood, and he immediately knew something was wrong. Dropping whatever he had in his hand, he followed the trails of blood to the bathroom. In your busy mind, you forgot to lock the bathroom so Tony was able to get in easily.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like what he saw.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY! Call an ambulance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cY/N, wake up,\u201d he panicked, looking at your wound which was still gushing blood. He grabbed a clean towel from the rack and placed it over the wounds with immense pressure to get the bleeding to stop.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Please!\u201d</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>The pain in your side was still there, but it didn\u2019t hurt as much as it did before. All you could hear was the beeping coming from your heart monitor and Tony who was pacing the floor of your hospital room.</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d you whispered when you opened your eyes. He immediately came to your side and took your hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I was stupid. Someone shot me, and I didn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t see them. I didn\u2019t hear it\u2026 I didn\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d you took deep breaths between each pause.</p><p>\u201cSeeing you half dead on the bathroom floor made me worry. I\u2019ll find out who did this to you, but please, don\u2019t ever hide this from me. You lost a lot of blood and you weren\u2019t waking up. You fucking scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay now. The wounds are closed and your blood is staying right where it belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said before kissing your forehead.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>\u201cDid you do it? Did you complete your mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. I shot and killed Y/N Y/L/N,\u201d Bucky said in a monotone voice.</p><p>\u201cYou sure she is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched her take her last breath myself,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. You\u2019ll make a fine soldier when we\u2019re finished with you,\u201d one of HYDRA\u2019s personnel smiled wickedly.

He could never kill the love of his life, no matter how much they fuck with his brain.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>If you want to be tagged, add yourself to <b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1loroENIL02JGGewSW98VZtyN9KafcYFdhYcLat6MPHQ%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;t=MGFlYjI1MTFkYTQwMjc3ODA5ZjJlMGZlMzIxNjRjYjliYWZkYjRiNyxUbjFUTWx3YQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AfQpgf-Pc8j8gQyXeP5Nx8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fqueen-of-the-avengers.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175535300947%2Fdealing-with-the-big-problems\">this document</a>! </b>If your tag doesn\u2019t work,<b> <b><a href=\"https://queen-of-deans-booty.tumblr.com/post/168949327179/no-mention-zone-tumblr\">find out why</a>!</b></b></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDpk9mxC3Vgp2KzH4hBUpuQ\">@likiyoshi-lijie</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCYBx_h35wOHSanz-KWYkSA\">@gh0stgurl</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\">@until-theend-oftheline</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWUBifNx_ALnyYf8QCGl6iw\">@2dreamcatcher8</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\">@linkpk88</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt0NDolFnGpUbdpRp-oLMzw\">@vvishous</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPmSaWtNBYURkXYyTE4SQkQ\">@bemyqueenofdarkness</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6Il-apMbZXtrCjcwn6WzfQ\">@wittysunflower</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvnpbr0FaZJZ_2Yegj-CqQA\">@thejourneyneverendsx</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvp3BCrPWMwU2LPiWe4uHPQ\">@cutelittlepurplesouls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5U_u9GKDf0_WMKwI1CjkQ\">@feelmyroarrrr</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZK218wyouGSW3Gon3SiMWA\">@jointhehunt67</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB1mtlcXR1DSj6i8V_2-9uw\">@rayvenrider</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkDfcQ0-g2bBphYR6LZA8pA\">@xxloki81xx</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVIjDeqbeldSeiZd2oLMTFA\">@fandomgirl17</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m74Ud3okbnh6kIxrze1jbpQ\">@fatbottomedgeek</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHq62L049STfdlTXHEJk0lA\">@ivvitm1109</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte4aYh4BCFhSdnNIECKQAg\">@kendall-michele</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq79fl6uHP0Ayz65mPxhdAQ\">@niall2017</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrXIpJO9dREEMnm0CDm8TjA\">@schwankyblock</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKDwbu6idiycGZPI41sQ31g\">@fuckthatfeeling</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJp1hVuE-ruMYnLeUvhioLg\">@tardis-is-mine</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> \u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhq72MIcEjvxGR30ZHPmvgQ\">@kpoplover1306-depressedgirl315</a></p>",

Look at them, they are climbing the side of the building trying to break in. I call this a step down from our other missions,&rdquo; you said in your ear comm. Fury wanted you and Tony to take care of this problem before it escalated into something worse, but how much worse could it get?<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Would you just focus?&rdquo; Tony asked as he did a once over around the building. He got the easy job; all he was good for was flying and FRIDAY.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, they&rsquo;re common thieves. We should let PD handle this. Let&rsquo;s just call them and go back to the tower,&rdquo; you complained, watching as the two thieves continued to climb.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, focus! Seriously!&rdquo; Tony snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, boss?&rdquo; FRIDAY said from both ear comms. Tony made it possible for you to hear her in your ear as well as in his suit. He trusted you enough to let you in on the potential dangers.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, FRIDAY?&rdquo; you asked the AI.</p><p>&ldquo;They have a bomb on them that is powerful enough to level the city. The higher they go, the more fatalities there will be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, now I see the problem,&rdquo; you spoke and sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, can you get a clear shot?&rdquo; your boyfriend asked. Raising your specialized gun, you smirked as you locked onto the target.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I ever miss?&rdquo; Currently, you are the best markswoman known to man. There isn&rsquo;t a target you can&rsquo;t hit, and almost everyone wanted you to do their dirty work. You have superhuman like senses that allow you to see the world through a different eye. There was one time that you were able to hit a target that Tony was flying around at top speed with your eyes closed. Not being able to miss is a given due to your skills.</p><p>The only special thing about you was the serum you got when Steve had gotten his. The only thing it provided you with was that it could slow down your aging. It gave you a longer lifespan to get your dirty work done. You and Steve had been the ultimate fighting couple before he went under. After he resurfaced, things seemed to pick up right where they left off. However, when he surfaced, your heart belonged to Tony. Now, it was you and Tony who was the ultimate fighting couple.</p><p>&ldquo;I would advise against that Miss Y/L/N,&rdquo; FRIDAY spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; you asked as you kept your target locked.</p><p>&ldquo;One hit and that bomb goes off. Either way, the city is gone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what the hell are we supposed to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk to them. They&rsquo;re a couple of kids. FRIDAY get Wanda here. She can contain the blast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, what are you doing?&rdquo; you asked in a slight panic.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go talk to them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; you exclaimed just as he went off the air. &ldquo;FUCK!&rdquo; Looking around for a way to the roof, you couldn&rsquo;t help but feel eyes on you. Whoever was watching you, you knew they didn&rsquo;t have good intentions.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, please answer me,&rdquo; you said into your ear comm. When you received no answer, that is when you started to panic. The kids made it to the roof of the building they were climbing, and you started to walk to the entrance of the building. If breaking the door down means helping Tony, then you were going to do just that. As soon as you rounded the corner, paid started spreading from your side. Looking down, you saw a pool of blood growing from where the pain was. On the ground next to you was a bullet. Whoever shot you must have the world&rsquo;s quietest gun because you didn&rsquo;t hear a thing.</p><p>Your legs wobbled in protest, and you fell to the ground. Your mind finally caught up with what was happening, and you cried out in pain as you clutched your side. Tony wasn&rsquo;t answering, someone shot you, and kids might blow up the entire fucking city. What else could go wrong?</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N are you there?&rdquo; Tony spoke through the comm.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; you said as evenly as you possibly could. There was no way you were going to tell Tony that you were just shot. It was his idea to leave you on the ground since he thought you could get a better shot from down there even though you told him you could get a shot from anywhere. He would be overridden with guilt, and you didn&rsquo;t need that. As long as you got to the tower, you could patch this up yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay? I got the kids to give me the bomb. Wanda and Vision are here now. They are going to take these kids to PD. Where are you? We&rsquo;re going home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the ground,&rdquo; you said as you mentally slapped yourself. Tony could not see what had happened to you. Luckily for you, your jacket was dark and could cover up the color of blood. With all the strength you had, you forced yourself to get up. Your hands were shaky, your skin was pale, and your breathing was ragged. It would take a lot of power to try and convince your boyfriend that nothing was wrong with you.</p><p>Taking off your jacket, you wiped the blood off your hands before tying it around your waist, making sure to put pressure on the wound. All you wanted to do was scream at the top of your lungs and cry, but when you saw the Quinjet, you forced those feelings deep inside you. When Tony landed the bird, you immediately got on. Tony then had FRIDAY take you back to the tower on autopilot.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you okay?&rdquo; he asked as he placed the bomb carefully in a glass protector case.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you nodded curtly before walking away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure, you&rsquo;re looking a little pale.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Tony. Really. I just need silence, please,&rdquo; you pleaded, hoping he would give you what you wanted. If you talked anymore, your voice might give you away.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; he sighed as he walked back to the pilot&rsquo;s seat. As soon as he turned away from you, a tear rolled down your cheek.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>The first thing you did when Tony landed the bird back at the tower was rush to the nearest bathroom. He didn&rsquo;t question a thing but stayed back to make sure the bomb was safely carried inside, and to check to make sure the Quinjet was okay before shutting her off.</p><p>Slamming the bathroom door shut, you let out a small whimper of pain before taking off your jacket. The pain in your side had shot up to your arm, causing it to hurt with the slightest bit of movement. So, you tried your best to peel off your shirt with one hand. As soon as it was off, you dropped it to the floor and watched as buckets of blood began to pour from your wounds. There was an enter and exit hole from where the bullet traveled.</p><p>Grabbing Tony&rsquo;s nice white towels, you placed one over your wounds to try and get the bleeding to stop, but that only made the towel turn red. The blood would not stop flowing, and you were sure that you would die from blood loss if the bleeding didn&rsquo;t stop anytime soon. Your skin was pasty white, your hands shook from the pain, and your head started to feel dizzy. As you reached for the second towel hanging from the rack, your hand slipped, and you fell to the ground. There wasn&rsquo;t enough strength in you to get up, and there was no way to contact Tony to come and help you.</p><p>There was only you.</p><p>Tony had just finished checking some things off when he noticed a small pool of blood from where you were sitting the whole time. He looked on the landing and saw a few smaller pools of blood, and he immediately knew something was wrong. Dropping whatever he had in his hand, he followed the trails of blood to the bathroom. In your busy mind, you forgot to lock the bathroom so Tony was able to get in easily.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t like what he saw.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY! Call an ambulance!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, boss,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, wake up,&rdquo; he panicked, looking at your wound which was still gushing blood. He grabbed a clean towel from the rack and placed it over the wounds with immense pressure to get the bleeding to stop.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! Please!&rdquo;</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>The pain in your side was still there, but it didn&rsquo;t hurt as much as it did before. All you could hear was the beeping coming from your heart monitor and Tony who was pacing the floor of your hospital room.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; you whispered when you opened your eyes. He immediately came to your side and took your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. I was stupid. Someone shot me, and I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t see them. I didn&rsquo;t hear it&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t want you to worry,&rdquo; you took deep breaths between each pause.</p><p>&ldquo;Seeing you half dead on the bathroom floor made me worry. I&rsquo;ll find out who did this to you, but please, don&rsquo;t ever hide this from me. You lost a lot of blood and you weren&rsquo;t waking up. You fucking scared me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay now. The wounds are closed and your blood is staying right where it belongs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; he said before kissing your forehead.</p><p>********************************************************************************************</p><p>&ldquo;Did you do it? Did you complete your mission?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. I shot and killed Y/N Y/L/N,&rdquo; Bucky said in a monotone voice.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure she is dead?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I watched her take her last breath myself,&rdquo; he lied.</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent. You&rsquo;ll make a fine soldier when we&rsquo;re finished with you,&rdquo; one of HYDRA&rsquo;s personnel smiled wickedly. Bucky looked up at the man who had been experimenting on him from the beginning. His mission was to kill you, but for some reason, he only grazed your side. HYDRA can mess with his head all they want, but they can never erase the memory of you from his brain. The memories of the two of you together, being happy.
