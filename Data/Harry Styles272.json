London had suffered through weeks of abnormally hot weather and now she\nwas counting down the days until Autumn began. Her flat was on the 5th floor of\nher building and she just couldn\u2019t cool it down no matter how hard she tried,\nand Harry\u2019s house wasn\u2019t much better, but there were at least a few rooms that\ndidn\u2019t get direct sunlight that they could hide away in. The only problem was,\nHarry lived on the other side of London and that meant that a long stuffy tube\nride to get there and she knew that would probably give her another headache,\nbut if she wanted to be cool, she didn\u2019t really have another choice. So she\ngathered her things together and made sure she got her cold bottle of water out\nof the fridge and locked the door behind her. </p><p>The heat hit her as\nsoon as she left the building, and she let out an audible huff which made\npassers by turn their heads and nod at her, acknowledging their own disgust for\nthe hot air. It was a slow walk to the underground but by the time she got\nthere she was already covered in a film of sweat and she couldn\u2019t wait to get\nto Harry\u2019s. She sat down sat down in the corner of the compartment and pulled\nher phone out, putting her headphones in and pressing play on her audiobook,\nhoping that she could focus on something else. With her eyes closed she drifted\ninto a world of her own but it didn\u2019t take long for the headache and stomach\npains to set in. She took a sip from her water bottle and drew in a deep breath,\nher hand clenching her stomach waiting for it to subside a little. When it did,\nshe picked her phone up again and sent Harry a message. </p><p>\u201cCan you pick me up\nfrom the station, it\u2019s too hot to walk\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, how far\noff are you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTwo stops\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave now then,\nsee you soon xx\u201d </p><p>Anna kept taking in\ndeep breathes as she watched out the window at the black tunnell passing by.\nShe knew she\u2019d be ok once she was out in the open again but right now she\nwasn\u2019t sure she was going to make it without hurling her guts all through the\ntrain compartment. But she did make it and she was the first to get off at her\nstop. The heat in the underground was almost unbearable though and Anna\ncouldn\u2019t wait to get outside where there was the slightest breeze to cool her a\nlittle. True to his word, Harry was waiting outside the tube station in his car\nand Anna jogged over to it. </p><p>\u201cHi Styles\u201d she\nhuffed, taking her seat leaning over to kiss his cheek </p><p>\u201cBit hot out there?\u201d\nhe laughed </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\nalmost puked all over the tube\u201d </p><p>His expression fell\nat the mention of Anna being unwell \u201cYou alright now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded \u201cI\njust needed some air\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s house was\ncool, he had all the blinds and curtains shut off so that the sun couldn&rsquo;t get\nin and his back guest room was set up so that they could spend the entire day\nin there, escaping the harsh heat. He\u2019d moved the bed out and laid a picnic\nblanket on the floor with two pillows for them to rest on. His favourite\nguitar, the one that he used to play \u201cOh Anna\u201d on tour was sitting in the\ncorner and he had a stack of DVDs sitting on the coffee table, ready for them\nto watch. </p><p>Anna made herself\ncomfortable on the picnic rug and pulled out her laptop. Today was a work day,\nthey\u2019d agreed on that before she came over but the weather made it hard to\nfocus and eventually, Anna gave up on the proposal she was working on and sat\nand watched as Harry strummed on his guitar. He wasn\u2019t doing anything in\nparticular, just recording a few new riffs that he might be able to use for new\nsongs when he finally gets back into the studio. He had his brown leather\nnotebook laid out and was scrawling lone lyrics down as they came to him but\nAnna had other ideas for the page and she began doodling all over it, mostly\ntiny little cartoons of the two of them together and a few other little\ncharacters.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\ncould draw\u201d Harry said after watching her for a while </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really, I\nhave a doctors appointment tomorrow\u201d Anna said softly when Harry stopped\nstrumming his guitar, \u201cTrying to keep myself distracted\u201d</p><p>He put the guitar\ndown and looked at her \u201cDo you want me to come?\u201d </p><p>Anna stayed quiet for\na moment mulling over her answer \u201cI think so\u201d she finally uttered </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to\u201d he\nsaid \u201cBut I know you\u2019re nervous\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to\u201d\nshe smiled \u201cIt\u2019s at 11:30\u201d </p><p>\u201cStay here tonight,\nI\u2019ll cook us breakfast in the morning\u201d he leant over and kissed her forehead\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine An\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks H\u201d she closed\nher laptop and laid down on the picnic blanket, staring up at the roof. The air\noutside had cooled slightly and in the distance dark clouds were rolling in\nbringing with them the cool change that they so desperately waited for. </p><p>Thunder storms had\nalways been Anna\u2019s favourite part of Summer, she loved how the world went dark\njust beforehand, like the city had suddenly been taken over by dementors, and\nthe rain. She loved watching the rain fall down, and on a day like today, she\nloved to sit out in it and cool down. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside\u201d\nshe said after a few minutes of silence after their last conversation. </p><p>Harry stood and\nopened the blinds revealing the dark sky \u201cIt\u2019s about to rain love\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\u201d she stood\nand held her hand out, enticing him to grab on. He did, shrugging and grabbing\nhis phone off the floor as Anna dragged him out of the room. She went straight\nfor the back door, but Harry pulled her back towards the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo no no\u201d he smiled\n\u201cif we\u2019re going to be out in the rain, we\u2019re doing it right\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe rain is that\nway\u201d Anna giggled pointing at the back door. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d he kept\nwalking up the stairs \u201cI have a rooftop garden\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course you do\u201d\nshe rolled her eyes. </p><p>They climbed the\nstairs to the second floor where Harry\u2019s bedroom was and then he dragged her up\npast his office and the guest bedrooms on the third floor and up to the fourth\nwhere Anna had never been before. There wasn\u2019t much to it, a sitting room with\na grand piano and some artwork, which Anna guessed was worth more than\neverything she owned and then some. Thunder roared just as Harry unlocked the\ndoor to the rooftop and he flinched a little. </p><p>\u201cNot scared of\nthunder are you Styles?\u201d Anna giggled, walking backwards out into the storm </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he huffed,\noffended that she thought he was scared of anything. </p><p>\u201cWhatever\u201d she turned\naround and took in the view, clouds still rolling in over the city, which was\nalmost entirely visible from there. </p><p>\u201cThis might just be\nthe best view in London\u201d she said, turning around and looking at it from all\nangles. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he said, his\ngaze focused not on the skyline that surrounded them, but on Anna who was\ncompletely oblivious to the fact. </p><p>A few lone drops\nstarted to fall from the sky and Anna stretched her arms out to catch them and\nthen the lone drops turned into a flood of water falling from the sky and she\ncouldn\u2019t stop herself from laughing. Harry was still standing under the eves of\nthe house, watching Anna enjoy the storm, a huge smile stretched across his\nface. </p><p>\u201cGet your butt out\nhere Styles\u201d she said through her giggles, holding her hand out and grabbing\nonto his. Reluctantly he followed and rain fell down his back, cooling his\nwhole body and turning his white shirt transparent, revealing his chest full of\ntattoos. With Anna\u2019s hand already in his he pulled her in closer to him, so\nthat they were standing only inches away from each other. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit\u201d Anna\nwhispered, pulling him down to the ground with her. Their bodies were entirely\nsoaked by now, their hair sticking to their faces and dripping down their\nbacks. Lightning flashed across the sky, turning the clouds from black to\npurple and Anna rested her head on Harry\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this beautiful\nH?\u201d she whispered, looking up at him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful An\u201d\nhe kissed her forehead and used his pointer finger to lift her chin so that she\nwas looking directly at him. </p><p>\u201cI love you Anna\nLouise Elliot\u201d </p><p>There they were.\nThose three words she\u2019d wanted to say for weeks now, finally rolling off his\ntongue, sending shivers down her spine. </p><p>\u201cI love you too Harry\nEdward Styles\u201d she giggled \u201calways will\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cMiss Elliot\u201d Anna\u2019s\ndoctor poked her head around the corner and ushered both her and Harry into the\nroom.</p><p>\u201cJust here for a\ncheck up today love?\u201d she smiled. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Anna\nblushed \u201cI\u2019ve been having these stomach pains for a while now, they were going\naway but now it\u2019s constant\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk\u201d Doctor O\u2019connell\nsaid, in a soft, sweet tone that only emphasized her Irish accent \u201cDo you\nremember when it started?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBack in June, it\nstarted as a migraine\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s your\nappetite been?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot great this week,\neven the thought of food makes me ill\u201d </p><p>She nodded, taking\nsome notes on her computer \u201cWhen was your last period love?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s eyes widened\n\u201cTwo months ago\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs there a chance\nyou could be pregnant?\u201d </p><p>Anna and Harry looked\nat each other, both of them blushing. Harry\u2019s hand moved onto Anna\u2019s knee, a\ngesture of comfort. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI guess I could be?\u201d\n\u00a0Anna said, embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t thought of that before now. </p><p>\u201cWhen was the last\ntime you had sex?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLast Night\u201d they\nboth said quietly but in unison. </p><p>\u201cAnd before that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFriday\u201d Harry said\nbefore clearing his throat </p><p>\u201cAre you using\nCondoms?\u201d Dr O\u2019Connell asked, looking at them over her glasses </p><p>They both nodded but\ndidn\u2019t say anything, too shocked by the thought of a baby.</p><p>\u201cRight well there\u2019s\nalways a chance, so let\u2019s rule that out before we go looking for something\nelse\u201d She turned in her chair and opened the drawer sitting next to her desk,\npulling out a specimen jar and slammed it down on the desk next to Anna. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bathroom\njust down the hall, bring this back when you\u2019re finished\u201d </p><p>She took the jar and\nstood from her chair, passed her handbag to Harry without and word and walked\nout of the room. This couldn\u2019t be real. A baby? How could she be a mother, she\ncould barely look after herself and how could Harry be a dad? He was too busy\nwith work to be able to give the child enough of his time, christ even\nyesterday when Anna was over he couldn\u2019t leave his guitar alone long enough for\nthem to have a full conversation. Not that she minded, she loved it when he\nsang. They\u2019d been so careful she wasn\u2019t on the pill, but they always, always\nused condoms. There was no way there could be a baby in there.</p><p>She slid back into Dr\nO'connell&rsquo;s office after using the bathroom, with the jar in her hand and\nplaced it back on the desk, red faced with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cRight then\u201d the\ndoctor said warmly as she put on a pair of gloves \u201cLet\u2019s find out if there\u2019s a\nbaby in there.\u201d </p><p>Harry held on tightly\nto Anna knee while they waited for the results to show up on the test stick.\nAnna\u2019s heart was practically beating out of her chest and Harry couldn\u2019t stop\npulling his lip with his free hand. It took three minutes for the results to\nshow, but it felt like three hours and by the time Dr O'connell opened her\nmouth Anna felt like she was about to throw up. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s negative\u201d she\nsaid </p><p>They both let out a\ndeep sigh. Thank God. Now wasn\u2019t the time for babies. Harry loosened his grip\non Anna\u2019s knee but kept his hand there, because if there was no baby, there was\nsomething else. </p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s talk more\nabout these stomach pains then because missing two periods isn\u2019t a good sign,\nwhat kind of pain is it?\u201d she was speaking with a tone of concern now, instead\nof excitement. </p><p>\u201cUsually, it\u2019s a dull\nache all over, but when it gets worse it\u2019s sharp and on my sides\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmmm\u201d she tapped her\npen on the desk \u201ccould be kidney\u2019s, why don\u2019t you pop up on that bed over there\nand I\u2019ll examine you\u201d </p><p>Anna stood up again\nand walked over to the examination table. Kidney\u2019s. Couldn\u2019t they go back to\nthe baby idea? That was way less scary. She laid down on the sterilised paper\nsheets and lifted her shirt just below her bra. Dr O'connell drew the curtains\nso that Harry couldn\u2019t see and began pressing on Anna\u2019s belly. </p><p>\u201cYou tell me where it\nhurts love\u201d she said softly</p><p>\u201cEverywhere\u201d she\nchoked until she pressed on her left side, \u201cThere\u201d she squeaked \u201cThat hurts\u201d </p><p>Dr O\u2019Connell took her\nhands away and helped Anna sit up. </p><p>\u201cOk, next step is to\ntake some bloods and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on inside. Are you ok with\nneedles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna shook her\nhead </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s\nfor\u201d she drew the curtains back and smiled at Harry. \u201cYour presence is required\ngood sir\u201d </p><p>Harry giggled \u201cWhat\nare boyfriends for\u201d </p><p>\u201cHold her hand and\ntell her she\u2019s pretty while I get things ready\u201d </p><p>There was a reason\nAnna like Dr O'Connell so much, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily because of her\nmedical expertise, it was more her bedside manner. She always made Anna laugh\nand that made everything less scary. </p><p>\u201cYou are very pretty\u201d\nHarry said \u201cEven if you do look a little pale right now\u201d </p><p>Anna smiled\nsheepishly and grabbed onto Harry\u2019s outstretched hand \u201cI hate needles\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a tiny\npinch, and you can squeeze my hand as hard as you need to\u201d </p><p>The Doctor walked\nback over to them with a tray of all the things that she needed to take Anna\u2019s\nblood. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at\nthis over the years love, you won\u2019t even feel it\u201d she said reassuringly,\npulling a pair of gloves over her hands and using an alcohol wipe to sterilise\nthe area. Anna held tightly onto to Harry\u2019s hand and squeezed her eyes shut so\nthat she didn\u2019t have to watch what was happening. A tiny sting in her left arm\nlet her know that needle was in and before she knew it Dr O'connell was\nfinished. </p><p>\u201cAll done dear\u201d she\nsmiled. \u201cCome back and sit down over near the desk and we\u2019ll go over what\nhappens next\u201d </p><p>They both followed\nher back and sat down. Anna didn\u2019t know how she felt at this point, she thought\nshe was nervous, but she didn\u2019t know if that was just the pains coming back\nagain. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Anna\nthere\u2019s not much more I can do for you until we get your blood work back, but I\nwant to send you for an ultrasound on your kidneys as well see if we can get a\nbetter idea of what\u2019s causing you all this pain.\u201d She turned to her computer\nand printed out an order for the ultrasound and handed it to Anna. \u201cYou make\nsure you\u2019re drinking plenty of fluids in this weather, you need to stay\nhydrated\u201d She stood from her chair, which promoted Anna and Harry to do the\nsame </p><p>\u201cThank you for all of\nyour help Dr O\u2019Connell\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure\ndear, it will take a day or two, but I\u2019ll give you a call with your results,\nand you make that appointment for that scan as soon as you can\u201d She ushered\nthem out the door </p><p>\u201cI will\u201d Anna smiled\n\u201cThank you\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cThose one\u2019s\u201d Harry\nsaid pointing to the red pair of sunglasses that sat on Anna\u2019s dressing table </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Anna\nquestioned \u201cYou think she\u2019ll like them?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll like you so\nit doesn&rsquo;t matter\u201d \u00a0he checked his phone to see that it was already twenty\npast eleven \u201cshe won\u2019t if we\u2019re late though, we better get going\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine\u201d Anna huffed\npushing the sunglasses onto her face </p><p>\u201cYou look stunning as\nalways, plus she\u2019s my sister so she doesn\u2019t care what you look like\u201d</p><p>Anna was finally\ngetting to meet Gemma, and to say that she was nervous was an understatement.\nShe knew how much his family meant to Harry and she also knew much he cared\nwhat they thought. </p><p>\u201cHave you got your\nphone love?\u201d He asked before closing the door to her flat </p><p>\u201cWhen do I not have\nmy phone?\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cJust checking, Dr\nO'connell might ring back, that\u2019s all\u201d</p><p>That was the last\nthing she needed to be reminded of right now, but it had been a few days since\nher appointment and the blood results would be back any time now. </p><p>They weren\u2019t doing\nanything overly exciting with Gemma, just a pub lunch, Charli had even agreed\nto join them and take the pressure off a little. It didn\u2019t help that Anna\nwasn\u2019t feeling well anyway, but when they walked in and saw that Gemma was\nalready sitting at the bar, Anna\u2019s stomach dropped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early\nfor wine isn\u2019t Gems?\u201d Harry said, startling her. </p><p>\u201cI thought it was\ngetting close to five, you\u2019re so late\u201d she said sarcastically although Anna was\npretty sure she wasn&rsquo;t joking</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d Harry sighed\n\u201cMy fault, couldn\u2019t find my car keys\u201d </p><p>She shrugged and Anna\nlet go of the breath that she\u2019d taken when Gemma mentioned being late, grateful\nthat Harry had taken the blame. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you\nin months, where\u2019s my hug?\u201d she said. </p><p>Harry obliged and\nwrapped his arms around her. It warmed Anna\u2019s heart how close they were, even\nafter spending months apart they could go back to being the best of friends,\nwhich said something about them both as people. </p><p>As they pulled away\nfrom the hug, Gemma turned straight to Anna and held out her hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gemma, it\u2019s nice\nto finally meet you, this dickhead hasn\u2019t shut up about you since he met you\u201d </p><p>\u201cLikewise\u201d Anna\nsmiled \u201cI\u2019m Anna by the way\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know hun\u201d Gemma\nnodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s find somewhere to sit, shall we?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside,\nit\u2019s too nice out to be inside\u201d Anna added, needing the fresh air to calm her\nnerves. </p><p>\u201cGood idea\u201d Harry\nnodded and grabbed onto her hand. </p><p>Once they found a\nseat and ordered their meals, Anna began to ease into the conversation and by\nthe time Charli arrived, Anna couldn\u2019t remember why she was so nervous about\nthis, Gemma was just as lovely as Harry. She wasn\u2019t over protective of him, she\ndidn\u2019t question why Anna was with him and maybe that was because she could see\nthat he was totally in love with her and that\u2019s all that matters. </p><p>\u201cHiya\u201d Charli said as\nshe made her way over to their table \u201cI\u2019m so so sorry I\u2019m late, got stuck in a\nmeeting\u201d </p><p>\u201cHappens to the best\nof us\u201d Harry said, smiling at her </p><p>\u201cI ordered you some\nvegetarian lasagna\u201d Anna said, moving closer to Harry so that Charli could sit\ndown next to her </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charli,\u201d she\nsaid to Gemma \u201cAnna\u2019s manger slash best friend\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gemma\u201d she said\nin response \u201cHarry\u2019s sister slash life coach\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bold\nstatement\u201d Harry chimed in \u201cDon\u2019t let jeffy hear you say that\u201d </p><p>\u201cAww, I miss Jeffy\u201d\nGemma sighed \u201cHow is he?\u201d </p><p>Conversion continued\nto flow easily as Harry and Anna recapped the tour, and Gemma and Charli filled\nthem both in on what they\u2019d missed in London while they\u2019d been gone. There were\ntimes when they would break into two separate conversations but it always came\nback to the four of them and Harry always kept his hand on Anna\u2019s knee.</p><p>Their food arrived\nand everyone started eating but the smell of it made Anna feel ill and she was\nonly a few bites in before she had to stop. Harry knew not to say anything in\nfront of Gemma, but he gave her a worried look that she just shrugged off, not\nbeing able to do anything about it right now. </p><p>\u201cThat looks good, An\u201d\nHarry said, a mouth still half full of his own lunch \u201cCan I steal some?\u201d </p><p> She could see what he was doing and she played\nalong \u201cDon\u2019t you ever eat your own food?\u201d she said sarcastically to make the\nwhole thing look more real. </p><p>\u201cYours looks better\u201d\nhe shrugged reaching over and taking some chips from her plate </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been\nlike this\u201d Gemma added, \u201cwon\u2019t settle until he\u2019s tried everyone\u2019s food\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want any of\nyours\u201d he said, using his fork to take a mouthful of pasta from Anna\u2019s plate.\nHe continued to subtly take her food, until her plate was almost empty and her\nphone started to ring. His grip tightened on her knee when he saw that the\nnumber on her screen was Dr O'Connell&rsquo;s. She looked at him nervously before she\npicked it up and stood from her seat at the table, walking away so that they\ncouldn\u2019t hear her conversation. </p><p>\u201cHello, Anna\nspeaking\u201d she said, her voice shaking a little. </p><p>\u201cHi Anna dear, It\u2019s\nDr O\u2019connell, is now a good time to talk?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, now\u2019s fine\u201d her\nheart was beating out of her chest and she barely form a coherent thought </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had a look\nat your blood results and there\u2019s a few abnormalities, I\u2019ll need you to come in\nas soon as possible for some more tests\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u201d Anna breathed\n</p><p>\u201cI know that sounds\nscary love, but it\u2019s not all that bad, I\u2019m going to need to see you again as\nsoon as possible for some more testing and to see if we can get you started on\ntreatment. How does tomorrow at 8:15 sound?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cOk love, see you\nthen and bring that nice handsome boy with you to hold your hand\u201d </p>",

The air\noutside had cooled slightly and in the distance dark clouds were rolling in\nbringing with them the cool change that they so desperately waited for. </p><p>Thunder storms had\nalways been Anna\u2019s favourite part of Summer, she loved how the world went dark\njust beforehand, like the city had suddenly been taken over by dementors, and\nthe rain. She loved watching the rain fall down, and on a day like today, she\nloved to sit out in it and cool down. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside\u201d\nshe said after a few minutes of silence after their last conversation. </p><p>Harry stood and\nopened the blinds revealing the dark sky \u201cIt\u2019s about to rain love\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\u201d she stood\nand held her hand out, enticing him to grab on. He did, shrugging and grabbing\nhis phone off the floor as Anna dragged him out of the room. She went straight\nfor the back door, but Harry pulled her back towards the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo no no\u201d he smiled\n\u201cif we\u2019re going to be out in the rain, we\u2019re doing it right\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe rain is that\nway\u201d Anna giggled pointing at the back door. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d he kept\nwalking up the stairs \u201cI have a rooftop garden\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course you do\u201d\nshe rolled her eyes. </p><p>They climbed the\nstairs to the second floor where Harry\u2019s bedroom was and then he dragged her up\npast his office and the guest bedrooms on the third floor and up to the fourth\nwhere Anna had never been before. There wasn\u2019t much to it, a sitting room with\na grand piano and some artwork, which Anna guessed was worth more than\neverything she owned and then some. Thunder roared just as Harry unlocked the\ndoor to the rooftop and he flinched a little. </p><p>\u201cNot scared of\nthunder are you Styles?\u201d Anna giggled, walking backwards out into the storm </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he huffed,\noffended that she thought he was scared of anything. </p><p>\u201cWhatever\u201d she turned\naround and took in the view, clouds still rolling in over the city, which was\nalmost entirely visible from there. </p><p>\u201cThis might just be\nthe best view in London\u201d she said, turning around and looking at it from all\nangles. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he said, his\ngaze focused not on the skyline that surrounded them, but on Anna who was\ncompletely oblivious to the fact. </p><p>A few lone drops\nstarted to fall from the sky and Anna stretched her arms out to catch them and\nthen the lone drops turned into a flood of water falling from the sky and she\ncouldn\u2019t stop herself from laughing. Harry was still standing under the eves of\nthe house, watching Anna enjoy the storm, a huge smile stretched across his\nface. </p><p>\u201cGet your butt out\nhere Styles\u201d she said through her giggles, holding her hand out and grabbing\nonto his. Reluctantly he followed and rain fell down his back, cooling his\nwhole body and turning his white shirt transparent, revealing his chest full of\ntattoos. With Anna\u2019s hand already in his he pulled her in closer to him, so\nthat they were standing only inches away from each other. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit\u201d Anna\nwhispered, pulling him down to the ground with her. Their bodies were entirely\nsoaked by now, their hair sticking to their faces and dripping down their\nbacks. Lightning flashed across the sky, turning the clouds from black to\npurple and Anna rested her head on Harry\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this beautiful\nH?\u201d she whispered, looking up at him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful An\u201d\nhe kissed her forehead and used his pointer finger to lift her chin so that she\nwas looking directly at him. </p><p>\u201cI love you Anna\nLouise Elliot\u201d </p><p>There they were.\nThose three words she\u2019d wanted to say for weeks now, finally rolling off his\ntongue, sending shivers down her spine. </p><p>\u201cI love you too Harry\nEdward Styles\u201d she giggled \u201calways will\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cMiss Elliot\u201d Anna\u2019s\ndoctor poked her head around the corner and ushered both her and Harry into the\nroom.</p><p>\u201cJust here for a\ncheck up today love?\u201d she smiled. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Anna\nblushed \u201cI\u2019ve been having these stomach pains for a while now, they were going\naway but now it\u2019s constant\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk\u201d Doctor O\u2019connell\nsaid, in a soft, sweet tone that only emphasized her Irish accent \u201cDo you\nremember when it started?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBack in June, it\nstarted as a migraine\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s your\nappetite been?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot great this week,\neven the thought of food makes me ill\u201d </p><p>She nodded, taking\nsome notes on her computer \u201cWhen was your last period love?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s eyes widened\n\u201cTwo months ago\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs there a chance\nyou could be pregnant?\u201d </p><p>Anna and Harry looked\nat each other, both of them blushing. Harry\u2019s hand moved onto Anna\u2019s knee, a\ngesture of comfort. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI guess I could be?\u201d\n\u00a0Anna said, embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t thought of that before now. </p><p>\u201cWhen was the last\ntime you had sex?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLast Night\u201d they\nboth said quietly but in unison. </p><p>\u201cAnd before that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFriday\u201d Harry said\nbefore clearing his throat </p><p>\u201cAre you using\nCondoms?\u201d Dr O\u2019Connell asked, looking at them over her glasses </p><p>They both nodded but\ndidn\u2019t say anything, too shocked by the thought of a baby.</p><p>\u201cRight well there\u2019s\nalways a chance, so let\u2019s rule that out before we go looking for something\nelse\u201d She turned in her chair and opened the drawer sitting next to her desk,\npulling out a specimen jar and slammed it down on the desk next to Anna. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bathroom\njust down the hall, bring this back when you\u2019re finished\u201d </p><p>She took the jar and\nstood from her chair, passed her handbag to Harry without and word and walked\nout of the room. This couldn\u2019t be real. A baby? How could she be a mother, she\ncould barely look after herself and how could Harry be a dad? He was too busy\nwith work to be able to give the child enough of his time, christ even\nyesterday when Anna was over he couldn\u2019t leave his guitar alone long enough for\nthem to have a full conversation. Not that she minded, she loved it when he\nsang. They\u2019d been so careful she wasn\u2019t on the pill, but they always, always\nused condoms. There was no way there could be a baby in there.</p><p>She slid back into Dr\nO'connell\u2019s office after using the bathroom, with the jar in her hand and\nplaced it back on the desk, red faced with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cRight then\u201d the\ndoctor said warmly as she put on a pair of gloves \u201cLet\u2019s find out if there\u2019s a\nbaby in there.\u201d </p><p>Harry held on tightly\nto Anna knee while they waited for the results to show up on the test stick.\nAnna\u2019s heart was practically beating out of her chest and Harry couldn\u2019t stop\npulling his lip with his free hand. It took three minutes for the results to\nshow, but it felt like three hours and by the time Dr O'connell opened her\nmouth Anna felt like she was about to throw up. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s negative\u201d she\nsaid </p><p>They both let out a\ndeep sigh. Thank God. Now wasn\u2019t the time for babies. Harry loosened his grip\non Anna\u2019s knee but kept his hand there, because if there was no baby, there was\nsomething else. </p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s talk more\nabout these stomach pains then because missing two periods isn\u2019t a good sign,\nwhat kind of pain is it?\u201d she was speaking with a tone of concern now, instead\nof excitement. </p><p>\u201cUsually, it\u2019s a dull\nache all over, but when it gets worse it\u2019s sharp and on my sides\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmmm\u201d she tapped her\npen on the desk \u201ccould be kidney\u2019s, why don\u2019t you pop up on that bed over there\nand I\u2019ll examine you\u201d </p><p>Anna stood up again\nand walked over to the examination table. Kidney\u2019s. Couldn\u2019t they go back to\nthe baby idea? That was way less scary. She laid down on the sterilised paper\nsheets and lifted her shirt just below her bra. Dr O'connell drew the curtains\nso that Harry couldn\u2019t see and began pressing on Anna\u2019s belly. </p><p>\u201cYou tell me where it\nhurts love\u201d she said softly</p><p>\u201cEverywhere\u201d she\nchoked until she pressed on her left side, \u201cThere\u201d she squeaked \u201cThat hurts\u201d </p><p>Dr O\u2019Connell took her\nhands away and helped Anna sit up. </p><p>\u201cOk, next step is to\ntake some bloods and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on inside. Are you ok with\nneedles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna shook her\nhead </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s\nfor\u201d she drew the curtains back and smiled at Harry. \u201cYour presence is required\ngood sir\u201d </p><p>Harry giggled \u201cWhat\nare boyfriends for\u201d </p><p>\u201cHold her hand and\ntell her she\u2019s pretty while I get things ready\u201d </p><p>There was a reason\nAnna like Dr O'Connell so much, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily because of her\nmedical expertise, it was more her bedside manner. She always made Anna laugh\nand that made everything less scary. </p><p>\u201cYou are very pretty\u201d\nHarry said \u201cEven if you do look a little pale right now\u201d </p><p>Anna smiled\nsheepishly and grabbed onto Harry\u2019s outstretched hand \u201cI hate needles\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a tiny\npinch, and you can squeeze my hand as hard as you need to\u201d </p><p>The Doctor walked\nback over to them with a tray of all the things that she needed to take Anna\u2019s\nblood. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at\nthis over the years love, you won\u2019t even feel it\u201d she said reassuringly,\npulling a pair of gloves over her hands and using an alcohol wipe to sterilise\nthe area. Anna held tightly onto to Harry\u2019s hand and squeezed her eyes shut so\nthat she didn\u2019t have to watch what was happening. A tiny sting in her left arm\nlet her know that needle was in and before she knew it Dr O'connell was\nfinished. </p><p>\u201cAll done dear\u201d she\nsmiled. \u201cCome back and sit down over near the desk and we\u2019ll go over what\nhappens next\u201d </p><p>They both followed\nher back and sat down. Anna didn\u2019t know how she felt at this point, she thought\nshe was nervous, but she didn\u2019t know if that was just the pains coming back\nagain. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Anna\nthere\u2019s not much more I can do for you until we get your blood work back, but I\nwant to send you for an ultrasound on your kidneys as well see if we can get a\nbetter idea of what\u2019s causing you all this pain.\u201d She turned to her computer\nand printed out an order for the ultrasound and handed it to Anna. \u201cYou make\nsure you\u2019re drinking plenty of fluids in this weather, you need to stay\nhydrated\u201d She stood from her chair, which promoted Anna and Harry to do the\nsame </p><p>\u201cThank you for all of\nyour help Dr O\u2019Connell\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure\ndear, it will take a day or two, but I\u2019ll give you a call with your results,\nand you make that appointment for that scan as soon as you can\u201d She ushered\nthem out the door </p><p>\u201cI will\u201d Anna smiled\n\u201cThank you\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cThose one\u2019s\u201d Harry\nsaid pointing to the red pair of sunglasses that sat on Anna\u2019s dressing table </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Anna\nquestioned \u201cYou think she\u2019ll like them?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll like you so\nit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d \u00a0he checked his phone to see that it was already twenty\npast eleven \u201cshe won\u2019t if we\u2019re late though, we better get going\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine\u201d Anna huffed\npushing the sunglasses onto her face </p><p>\u201cYou look stunning as\nalways, plus she\u2019s my sister so she doesn\u2019t care what you look like\u201d</p><p>Anna was finally\ngetting to meet Gemma, and to say that she was nervous was an understatement.\nShe knew how much his family meant to Harry and she also knew much he cared\nwhat they thought. </p><p>\u201cHave you got your\nphone love?\u201d He asked before closing the door to her flat </p><p>\u201cWhen do I not have\nmy phone?\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cJust checking, Dr\nO'connell might ring back, that\u2019s all\u201d</p><p>That was the last\nthing she needed to be reminded of right now, but it had been a few days since\nher appointment and the blood results would be back any time now. </p><p>They weren\u2019t doing\nanything overly exciting with Gemma, just a pub lunch, Charli had even agreed\nto join them and take the pressure off a little. It didn\u2019t help that Anna\nwasn\u2019t feeling well anyway, but when they walked in and saw that Gemma was\nalready sitting at the bar, Anna\u2019s stomach dropped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early\nfor wine isn\u2019t Gems?\u201d Harry said, startling her. </p><p>\u201cI thought it was\ngetting close to five, you\u2019re so late\u201d she said sarcastically although Anna was\npretty sure she wasn\u2019t joking</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d Harry sighed\n\u201cMy fault, couldn\u2019t find my car keys\u201d </p><p>She shrugged and Anna\nlet go of the breath that she\u2019d taken when Gemma mentioned being late, grateful\nthat Harry had taken the blame. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you\nin months, where\u2019s my hug?\u201d she said. </p><p>Harry obliged and\nwrapped his arms around her. It warmed Anna\u2019s heart how close they were, even\nafter spending months apart they could go back to being the best of friends,\nwhich said something about them both as people. </p><p>As they pulled away\nfrom the hug, Gemma turned straight to Anna and held out her hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gemma, it\u2019s nice\nto finally meet you, this dickhead hasn\u2019t shut up about you since he met you\u201d </p><p>\u201cLikewise\u201d Anna\nsmiled \u201cI\u2019m Anna by the way\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know hun\u201d Gemma\nnodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s find somewhere to sit, shall we?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside,\nit\u2019s too nice out to be inside\u201d Anna added, needing the fresh air to calm her\nnerves. </p><p>\u201cGood idea\u201d Harry\nnodded and grabbed onto her hand. </p><p>Once they found a\nseat and ordered their meals, Anna began to ease into the conversation and by\nthe time Charli arrived, Anna couldn\u2019t remember why she was so nervous about\nthis, Gemma was just as lovely as Harry. She wasn\u2019t over protective of him, she\ndidn\u2019t question why Anna was with him and maybe that was because she could see\nthat he was totally in love with her and that\u2019s all that matters. </p><p>\u201cHiya\u201d Charli said as\nshe made her way over to their table \u201cI\u2019m so so sorry I\u2019m late, got stuck in a\nmeeting\u201d </p><p>\u201cHappens to the best\nof us\u201d Harry said, smiling at her </p><p>\u201cI ordered you some\nvegetarian lasagna\u201d Anna said, moving closer to Harry so that Charli could sit\ndown next to her </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charli,\u201d she\nsaid to Gemma \u201cAnna\u2019s manger slash best friend\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gemma\u201d she said\nin response \u201cHarry\u2019s sister slash life coach\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bold\nstatement\u201d Harry chimed in \u201cDon\u2019t let jeffy hear you say that\u201d </p><p>\u201cAww, I miss Jeffy\u201d\nGemma sighed \u201cHow is he?\u201d </p><p>Conversion continued\nto flow easily as Harry and Anna recapped the tour, and Gemma and Charli filled\nthem both in on what they\u2019d missed in London while they\u2019d been gone. There were\ntimes when they would break into two separate conversations but it always came\nback to the four of them and Harry always kept his hand on Anna\u2019s knee.</p><p>Their food arrived\nand everyone started eating but the smell of it made Anna feel ill and she was\nonly a few bites in before she had to stop. Harry knew not to say anything in\nfront of Gemma, but he gave her a worried look that she just shrugged off, not\nbeing able to do anything about it right now. </p><p>\u201cThat looks good, An\u201d\nHarry said, a mouth still half full of his own lunch \u201cCan I steal some?\u201d </p><p> She could see what he was doing and she played\nalong \u201cDon\u2019t you ever eat your own food?\u201d she said sarcastically to make the\nwhole thing look more real. </p><p>\u201cYours looks better\u201d\nhe shrugged reaching over and taking some chips from her plate </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been\nlike this\u201d Gemma added, \u201cwon\u2019t settle until he\u2019s tried everyone\u2019s food\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want any of\nyours\u201d he said, using his fork to take a mouthful of pasta from Anna\u2019s plate.\nHe continued to subtly take her food, until her plate was almost empty and her\nphone started to ring. His grip tightened on her knee when he saw that the\nnumber on her screen was Dr O'Connell\u2019s. She looked at him nervously before she\npicked it up and stood from her seat at the table, walking away so that they\ncouldn\u2019t hear her conversation. </p><p>\u201cHello, Anna\nspeaking\u201d she said, her voice shaking a little. </p><p>\u201cHi Anna dear, It\u2019s\nDr O\u2019connell, is now a good time to talk?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, now\u2019s fine\u201d her\nheart was beating out of her chest and she barely form a coherent thought </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had a look\nat your blood results and there\u2019s a few abnormalities, I\u2019ll need you to come in\nas soon as possible for some more tests\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u201d Anna breathed\n</p><p>\u201cI know that sounds\nscary love, but it\u2019s not all that bad, I\u2019m going to need to see you again as\nsoon as possible for some more testing and to see if we can get you started on\ntreatment. How does tomorrow at 8:15 sound?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cOk love, see you\nthen and bring that nice handsome boy with you to hold your hand\u201d </p></p>",

London had suffered through weeks of abnormally hot weather and now she\nwas counting down the days until Autumn began. Her flat was on the 5th floor of\nher building and she just couldn\u2019t cool it down no matter how hard she tried,\nand Harry\u2019s house wasn\u2019t much better, but there were at least a few rooms that\ndidn\u2019t get direct sunlight that they could hide away in. The only problem was,\nHarry lived on the other side of London and that meant that a long stuffy tube\nride to get there and she knew that would probably give her another headache,\nbut if she wanted to be cool, she didn\u2019t really have another choice. So she\ngathered her things together and made sure she got her cold bottle of water out\nof the fridge and locked the door behind her. </p><p>The heat hit her as\nsoon as she left the building, and she let out an audible huff which made\npassers by turn their heads and nod at her, acknowledging their own disgust for\nthe hot air. It was a slow walk to the underground but by the time she got\nthere she was already covered in a film of sweat and she couldn\u2019t wait to get\nto Harry\u2019s. She sat down sat down in the corner of the compartment and pulled\nher phone out, putting her headphones in and pressing play on her audiobook,\nhoping that she could focus on something else. With her eyes closed she drifted\ninto a world of her own but it didn\u2019t take long for the headache and stomach\npains to set in. She took a sip from her water bottle and drew in a deep breath,\nher hand clenching her stomach waiting for it to subside a little. When it did,\nshe picked her phone up again and sent Harry a message. </p><p>\u201cCan you pick me up\nfrom the station, it\u2019s too hot to walk\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, how far\noff are you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTwo stops\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave now then,\nsee you soon xx\u201d </p><p>Anna kept taking in\ndeep breathes as she watched out the window at the black tunnell passing by.\nShe knew she\u2019d be ok once she was out in the open again but right now she\nwasn\u2019t sure she was going to make it without hurling her guts all through the\ntrain compartment. But she did make it and she was the first to get off at her\nstop. The heat in the underground was almost unbearable though and Anna\ncouldn\u2019t wait to get outside where there was the slightest breeze to cool her a\nlittle. True to his word, Harry was waiting outside the tube station in his car\nand Anna jogged over to it. </p><p>\u201cHi Styles\u201d she\nhuffed, taking her seat leaning over to kiss his cheek </p><p>\u201cBit hot out there?\u201d\nhe laughed </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\nalmost puked all over the tube\u201d </p><p>His expression fell\nat the mention of Anna being unwell \u201cYou alright now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded \u201cI\njust needed some air\u201d </p><p>Harry\u2019s house was\ncool, he had all the blinds and curtains shut off so that the sun couldn\u2019t get\nin and his back guest room was set up so that they could spend the entire day\nin there, escaping the harsh heat. He\u2019d moved the bed out and laid a picnic\nblanket on the floor with two pillows for them to rest on. His favourite\nguitar, the one that he used to play \u201cOh Anna\u201d on tour was sitting in the\ncorner and he had a stack of DVDs sitting on the coffee table, ready for them\nto watch. </p><p>Anna made herself\ncomfortable on the picnic rug and pulled out her laptop. Today was a work day,\nthey\u2019d agreed on that before she came over but the weather made it hard to\nfocus and eventually, Anna gave up on the proposal she was working on and sat\nand watched as Harry strummed on his guitar. He wasn\u2019t doing anything in\nparticular, just recording a few new riffs that he might be able to use for new\nsongs when he finally gets back into the studio. He had his brown leather\nnotebook laid out and was scrawling lone lyrics down as they came to him but\nAnna had other ideas for the page and she began doodling all over it, mostly\ntiny little cartoons of the two of them together and a few other little\ncharacters.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\ncould draw\u201d Harry said after watching her for a while </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI can\u2019t really, I\nhave a doctors appointment tomorrow\u201d Anna said softly when Harry stopped\nstrumming his guitar, \u201cTrying to keep myself distracted\u201d</p><p>He put the guitar\ndown and looked at her \u201cDo you want me to come?\u201d </p><p>Anna stayed quiet for\na moment mulling over her answer \u201cI think so\u201d she finally uttered </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to\u201d he\nsaid \u201cBut I know you\u2019re nervous\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to\u201d\nshe smiled \u201cIt\u2019s at 11:30\u201d </p><p>\u201cStay here tonight,\nI\u2019ll cook us breakfast in the morning\u201d he leant over and kissed her forehead\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine An\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks H\u201d she closed\nher laptop and laid down on the picnic blanket, staring up at the roof. The air\noutside had cooled slightly and in the distance dark clouds were rolling in\nbringing with them the cool change that they so desperately waited for. </p><p>Thunder storms had\nalways been Anna\u2019s favourite part of Summer, she loved how the world went dark\njust beforehand, like the city had suddenly been taken over by dementors, and\nthe rain. She loved watching the rain fall down, and on a day like today, she\nloved to sit out in it and cool down. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside\u201d\nshe said after a few minutes of silence after their last conversation. </p><p>Harry stood and\nopened the blinds revealing the dark sky \u201cIt\u2019s about to rain love\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly\u201d she stood\nand held her hand out, enticing him to grab on. He did, shrugging and grabbing\nhis phone off the floor as Anna dragged him out of the room. She went straight\nfor the back door, but Harry pulled her back towards the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo no no\u201d he smiled\n\u201cif we\u2019re going to be out in the rain, we\u2019re doing it right\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe rain is that\nway\u201d Anna giggled pointing at the back door. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d he kept\nwalking up the stairs \u201cI have a rooftop garden\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course you do\u201d\nshe rolled her eyes. </p><p>They climbed the\nstairs to the second floor where Harry\u2019s bedroom was and then he dragged her up\npast his office and the guest bedrooms on the third floor and up to the fourth\nwhere Anna had never been before. There wasn\u2019t much to it, a sitting room with\na grand piano and some artwork, which Anna guessed was worth more than\neverything she owned and then some. Thunder roared just as Harry unlocked the\ndoor to the rooftop and he flinched a little. </p><p>\u201cNot scared of\nthunder are you Styles?\u201d Anna giggled, walking backwards out into the storm </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d he huffed,\noffended that she thought he was scared of anything. </p><p>\u201cWhatever\u201d she turned\naround and took in the view, clouds still rolling in over the city, which was\nalmost entirely visible from there. </p><p>\u201cThis might just be\nthe best view in London\u201d she said, turning around and looking at it from all\nangles. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d he said, his\ngaze focused not on the skyline that surrounded them, but on Anna who was\ncompletely oblivious to the fact. </p><p>A few lone drops\nstarted to fall from the sky and Anna stretched her arms out to catch them and\nthen the lone drops turned into a flood of water falling from the sky and she\ncouldn\u2019t stop herself from laughing. Harry was still standing under the eves of\nthe house, watching Anna enjoy the storm, a huge smile stretched across his\nface. </p><p>\u201cGet your butt out\nhere Styles\u201d she said through her giggles, holding her hand out and grabbing\nonto his. Reluctantly he followed and rain fell down his back, cooling his\nwhole body and turning his white shirt transparent, revealing his chest full of\ntattoos. With Anna\u2019s hand already in his he pulled her in closer to him, so\nthat they were standing only inches away from each other. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit\u201d Anna\nwhispered, pulling him down to the ground with her. Their bodies were entirely\nsoaked by now, their hair sticking to their faces and dripping down their\nbacks. Lightning flashed across the sky, turning the clouds from black to\npurple and Anna rested her head on Harry\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this beautiful\nH?\u201d she whispered, looking up at him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful An\u201d\nhe kissed her forehead and used his pointer finger to lift her chin so that she\nwas looking directly at him. </p><p>\u201cI love you Anna\nLouise Elliot\u201d </p><p>There they were.\nThose three words she\u2019d wanted to say for weeks now, finally rolling off his\ntongue, sending shivers down her spine. </p><p>\u201cI love you too Harry\nEdward Styles\u201d she giggled \u201calways will\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cMiss Elliot\u201d Anna\u2019s\ndoctor poked her head around the corner and ushered both her and Harry into the\nroom.</p><p>\u201cJust here for a\ncheck up today love?\u201d she smiled. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Anna\nblushed \u201cI\u2019ve been having these stomach pains for a while now, they were going\naway but now it\u2019s constant\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk\u201d Doctor O\u2019connell\nsaid, in a soft, sweet tone that only emphasized her Irish accent \u201cDo you\nremember when it started?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBack in June, it\nstarted as a migraine\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s your\nappetite been?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot great this week,\neven the thought of food makes me ill\u201d </p><p>She nodded, taking\nsome notes on her computer \u201cWhen was your last period love?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s eyes widened\n\u201cTwo months ago\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs there a chance\nyou could be pregnant?\u201d </p><p>Anna and Harry looked\nat each other, both of them blushing. Harry\u2019s hand moved onto Anna\u2019s knee, a\ngesture of comfort. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI guess I could be?\u201d\n\u00a0Anna said, embarrassed that she hadn\u2019t thought of that before now. </p><p>\u201cWhen was the last\ntime you had sex?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLast Night\u201d they\nboth said quietly but in unison. </p><p>\u201cAnd before that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFriday\u201d Harry said\nbefore clearing his throat </p><p>\u201cAre you using\nCondoms?\u201d Dr O\u2019Connell asked, looking at them over her glasses </p><p>They both nodded but\ndidn\u2019t say anything, too shocked by the thought of a baby.</p><p>\u201cRight well there\u2019s\nalways a chance, so let\u2019s rule that out before we go looking for something\nelse\u201d She turned in her chair and opened the drawer sitting next to her desk,\npulling out a specimen jar and slammed it down on the desk next to Anna. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bathroom\njust down the hall, bring this back when you\u2019re finished\u201d </p><p>She took the jar and\nstood from her chair, passed her handbag to Harry without and word and walked\nout of the room. This couldn\u2019t be real. A baby? How could she be a mother, she\ncould barely look after herself and how could Harry be a dad? He was too busy\nwith work to be able to give the child enough of his time, christ even\nyesterday when Anna was over he couldn\u2019t leave his guitar alone long enough for\nthem to have a full conversation. Not that she minded, she loved it when he\nsang. They\u2019d been so careful she wasn\u2019t on the pill, but they always, always\nused condoms. There was no way there could be a baby in there.</p><p>She slid back into Dr\nO'connell\u2019s office after using the bathroom, with the jar in her hand and\nplaced it back on the desk, red faced with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cRight then\u201d the\ndoctor said warmly as she put on a pair of gloves \u201cLet\u2019s find out if there\u2019s a\nbaby in there.\u201d </p><p>Harry held on tightly\nto Anna knee while they waited for the results to show up on the test stick.\nAnna\u2019s heart was practically beating out of her chest and Harry couldn\u2019t stop\npulling his lip with his free hand. It took three minutes for the results to\nshow, but it felt like three hours and by the time Dr O'connell opened her\nmouth Anna felt like she was about to throw up. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s negative\u201d she\nsaid </p><p>They both let out a\ndeep sigh. Thank God. Now wasn\u2019t the time for babies. Harry loosened his grip\non Anna\u2019s knee but kept his hand there, because if there was no baby, there was\nsomething else. </p><p>\u201cOk, let\u2019s talk more\nabout these stomach pains then because missing two periods isn\u2019t a good sign,\nwhat kind of pain is it?\u201d she was speaking with a tone of concern now, instead\nof excitement. </p><p>\u201cUsually, it\u2019s a dull\nache all over, but when it gets worse it\u2019s sharp and on my sides\u201d </p><p>\u201cHmmm\u201d she tapped her\npen on the desk \u201ccould be kidney\u2019s, why don\u2019t you pop up on that bed over there\nand I\u2019ll examine you\u201d </p><p>Anna stood up again\nand walked over to the examination table. Kidney\u2019s. Couldn\u2019t they go back to\nthe baby idea? That was way less scary. She laid down on the sterilised paper\nsheets and lifted her shirt just below her bra. Dr O'connell drew the curtains\nso that Harry couldn\u2019t see and began pressing on Anna\u2019s belly. </p><p>\u201cYou tell me where it\nhurts love\u201d she said softly</p><p>\u201cEverywhere\u201d she\nchoked until she pressed on her left side, \u201cThere\u201d she squeaked \u201cThat hurts\u201d </p><p>Dr O\u2019Connell took her\nhands away and helped Anna sit up. </p><p>\u201cOk, next step is to\ntake some bloods and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on inside. Are you ok with\nneedles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna shook her\nhead </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s\nfor\u201d she drew the curtains back and smiled at Harry. \u201cYour presence is required\ngood sir\u201d </p><p>Harry giggled \u201cWhat\nare boyfriends for\u201d </p><p>\u201cHold her hand and\ntell her she\u2019s pretty while I get things ready\u201d </p><p>There was a reason\nAnna like Dr O'Connell so much, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily because of her\nmedical expertise, it was more her bedside manner. She always made Anna laugh\nand that made everything less scary. </p><p>\u201cYou are very pretty\u201d\nHarry said \u201cEven if you do look a little pale right now\u201d </p><p>Anna smiled\nsheepishly and grabbed onto Harry\u2019s outstretched hand \u201cI hate needles\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a tiny\npinch, and you can squeeze my hand as hard as you need to\u201d </p><p>The Doctor walked\nback over to them with a tray of all the things that she needed to take Anna\u2019s\nblood. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at\nthis over the years love, you won\u2019t even feel it\u201d she said reassuringly,\npulling a pair of gloves over her hands and using an alcohol wipe to sterilise\nthe area. Anna held tightly onto to Harry\u2019s hand and squeezed her eyes shut so\nthat she didn\u2019t have to watch what was happening. A tiny sting in her left arm\nlet her know that needle was in and before she knew it Dr O'connell was\nfinished. </p><p>\u201cAll done dear\u201d she\nsmiled. \u201cCome back and sit down over near the desk and we\u2019ll go over what\nhappens next\u201d </p><p>They both followed\nher back and sat down. Anna didn\u2019t know how she felt at this point, she thought\nshe was nervous, but she didn\u2019t know if that was just the pains coming back\nagain. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Anna\nthere\u2019s not much more I can do for you until we get your blood work back, but I\nwant to send you for an ultrasound on your kidneys as well see if we can get a\nbetter idea of what\u2019s causing you all this pain.\u201d She turned to her computer\nand printed out an order for the ultrasound and handed it to Anna. \u201cYou make\nsure you\u2019re drinking plenty of fluids in this weather, you need to stay\nhydrated\u201d She stood from her chair, which promoted Anna and Harry to do the\nsame </p><p>\u201cThank you for all of\nyour help Dr O\u2019Connell\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure\ndear, it will take a day or two, but I\u2019ll give you a call with your results,\nand you make that appointment for that scan as soon as you can\u201d She ushered\nthem out the door </p><p>\u201cI will\u201d Anna smiled\n\u201cThank you\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>\u201cThose one\u2019s\u201d Harry\nsaid pointing to the red pair of sunglasses that sat on Anna\u2019s dressing table </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Anna\nquestioned \u201cYou think she\u2019ll like them?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll like you so\nit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d \u00a0he checked his phone to see that it was already twenty\npast eleven \u201cshe won\u2019t if we\u2019re late though, we better get going\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine\u201d Anna huffed\npushing the sunglasses onto her face </p><p>\u201cYou look stunning as\nalways, plus she\u2019s my sister so she doesn\u2019t care what you look like\u201d</p><p>Anna was finally\ngetting to meet Gemma, and to say that she was nervous was an understatement.\nShe knew how much his family meant to Harry and she also knew much he cared\nwhat they thought. </p><p>\u201cHave you got your\nphone love?\u201d He asked before closing the door to her flat </p><p>\u201cWhen do I not have\nmy phone?\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cJust checking, Dr\nO'connell might ring back, that\u2019s all\u201d</p><p>That was the last\nthing she needed to be reminded of right now, but it had been a few days since\nher appointment and the blood results would be back any time now. </p><p>They weren\u2019t doing\nanything overly exciting with Gemma, just a pub lunch, Charli had even agreed\nto join them and take the pressure off a little. It didn\u2019t help that Anna\nwasn\u2019t feeling well anyway, but when they walked in and saw that Gemma was\nalready sitting at the bar, Anna\u2019s stomach dropped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early\nfor wine isn\u2019t Gems?\u201d Harry said, startling her. </p><p>\u201cI thought it was\ngetting close to five, you\u2019re so late\u201d she said sarcastically although Anna was\npretty sure she wasn\u2019t joking</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d Harry sighed\n\u201cMy fault, couldn\u2019t find my car keys\u201d </p><p>She shrugged and Anna\nlet go of the breath that she\u2019d taken when Gemma mentioned being late, grateful\nthat Harry had taken the blame. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you\nin months, where\u2019s my hug?\u201d she said. </p><p>Harry obliged and\nwrapped his arms around her. It warmed Anna\u2019s heart how close they were, even\nafter spending months apart they could go back to being the best of friends,\nwhich said something about them both as people. </p><p>As they pulled away\nfrom the hug, Gemma turned straight to Anna and held out her hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gemma, it\u2019s nice\nto finally meet you, this dickhead hasn\u2019t shut up about you since he met you\u201d </p><p>\u201cLikewise\u201d Anna\nsmiled \u201cI\u2019m Anna by the way\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know hun\u201d Gemma\nnodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s find somewhere to sit, shall we?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go outside,\nit\u2019s too nice out to be inside\u201d Anna added, needing the fresh air to calm her\nnerves. </p><p>\u201cGood idea\u201d Harry\nnodded and grabbed onto her hand. </p><p>Once they found a\nseat and ordered their meals, Anna began to ease into the conversation and by\nthe time Charli arrived, Anna couldn\u2019t remember why she was so nervous about\nthis, Gemma was just as lovely as Harry. She wasn\u2019t over protective of him, she\ndidn\u2019t question why Anna was with him and maybe that was because she could see\nthat he was totally in love with her and that\u2019s all that matters. </p><p>\u201cHiya\u201d Charli said as\nshe made her way over to their table \u201cI\u2019m so so sorry I\u2019m late, got stuck in a\nmeeting\u201d </p><p>\u201cHappens to the best\nof us\u201d Harry said, smiling at her </p><p>\u201cI ordered you some\nvegetarian lasagna\u201d Anna said, moving closer to Harry so that Charli could sit\ndown next to her </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charli,\u201d she\nsaid to Gemma \u201cAnna\u2019s manger slash best friend\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gemma\u201d she said\nin response \u201cHarry\u2019s sister slash life coach\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bold\nstatement\u201d Harry chimed in \u201cDon\u2019t let jeffy hear you say that\u201d </p><p>\u201cAww, I miss Jeffy\u201d\nGemma sighed \u201cHow is he?\u201d </p><p>Conversion continued\nto flow easily as Harry and Anna recapped the tour, and Gemma and Charli filled\nthem both in on what they\u2019d missed in London while they\u2019d been gone. There were\ntimes when they would break into two separate conversations but it always came\nback to the four of them and Harry always kept his hand on Anna\u2019s knee.</p><p>Their food arrived\nand everyone started eating but the smell of it made Anna feel ill and she was\nonly a few bites in before she had to stop. Harry knew not to say anything in\nfront of Gemma, but he gave her a worried look that she just shrugged off, not\nbeing able to do anything about it right now. </p><p>\u201cThat looks good, An\u201d\nHarry said, a mouth still half full of his own lunch \u201cCan I steal some?\u201d </p><p> She could see what he was doing and she played\nalong \u201cDon\u2019t you ever eat your own food?\u201d she said sarcastically to make the\nwhole thing look more real. </p><p>\u201cYours looks better\u201d\nhe shrugged reaching over and taking some chips from her plate </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been\nlike this\u201d Gemma added, \u201cwon\u2019t settle until he\u2019s tried everyone\u2019s food\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want any of\nyours\u201d he said, using his fork to take a mouthful of pasta from Anna\u2019s plate.\nHe continued to subtly take her food, until her plate was almost empty and her\nphone started to ring. His grip tightened on her knee when he saw that the\nnumber on her screen was Dr O'Connell\u2019s. She looked at him nervously before she\npicked it up and stood from her seat at the table, walking away so that they\ncouldn\u2019t hear her conversation. </p><p>\u201cHello, Anna\nspeaking\u201d she said, her voice shaking a little. </p><p>\u201cHi Anna dear, It\u2019s\nDr O\u2019connell, is now a good time to talk?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, now\u2019s fine\u201d her\nheart was beating out of her chest and she barely form a coherent thought </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had a look\nat your blood results and there\u2019s a few abnormalities, I\u2019ll need you to come in\nas soon as possible for some more tests\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u201d Anna breathed\n</p><p>\u201cI know that sounds\nscary love, but it\u2019s not all that bad, I\u2019m going to need to see you again as\nsoon as possible for some more testing and to see if we can get you started on\ntreatment. How does tomorrow at 8:15 sound?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cOk love, see you\nthen and bring that nice handsome boy with you to hold your hand\u201d </p></p>",

London had suffered through weeks of abnormally hot weather and now she\nwas counting down the days until Autumn began. Her flat was on the 5th floor of\nher building and she just couldn&rsquo;t cool it down no matter how hard she tried,\nand Harry&rsquo;s house wasn&rsquo;t much better, but there were at least a few rooms that\ndidn&rsquo;t get direct sunlight that they could hide away in. The only problem was,\nHarry lived on the other side of London and that meant that a long stuffy tube\nride to get there and she knew that would probably give her another headache,\nbut if she wanted to be cool, she didn&rsquo;t really have another choice. So she\ngathered her things together and made sure she got her cold bottle of water out\nof the fridge and locked the door behind her. </p><p>The heat hit her as\nsoon as she left the building, and she let out an audible huff which made\npassers by turn their heads and nod at her, acknowledging their own disgust for\nthe hot air. It was a slow walk to the underground but by the time she got\nthere she was already covered in a film of sweat and she couldn&rsquo;t wait to get\nto Harry&rsquo;s. She sat down sat down in the corner of the compartment and pulled\nher phone out, putting her headphones in and pressing play on her audiobook,\nhoping that she could focus on something else. With her eyes closed she drifted\ninto a world of her own but it didn&rsquo;t take long for the headache and stomach\npains to set in. She took a sip from her water bottle and drew in a deep breath,\nher hand clenching her stomach waiting for it to subside a little. When it did,\nshe picked her phone up again and sent Harry a message. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you pick me up\nfrom the station, it&rsquo;s too hot to walk&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, how far\noff are you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Two stops&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave now then,\nsee you soon xx&rdquo; </p><p>Anna kept taking in\ndeep breathes as she watched out the window at the black tunnell passing by.\nShe knew she&rsquo;d be ok once she was out in the open again but right now she\nwasn&rsquo;t sure she was going to make it without hurling her guts all through the\ntrain compartment. But she did make it and she was the first to get off at her\nstop. The heat in the underground was almost unbearable though and Anna\ncouldn&rsquo;t wait to get outside where there was the slightest breeze to cool her a\nlittle. True to his word, Harry was waiting outside the tube station in his car\nand Anna jogged over to it. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi Styles&rdquo; she\nhuffed, taking her seat leaning over to kiss his cheek </p><p>&ldquo;Bit hot out there?&rdquo;\nhe laughed </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting,\nalmost puked all over the tube&rdquo; </p><p>His expression fell\nat the mention of Anna being unwell &ldquo;You alright now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she nodded &ldquo;I\njust needed some air&rdquo; </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s house was\ncool, he had all the blinds and curtains shut off so that the sun couldn&rsquo;t get\nin and his back guest room was set up so that they could spend the entire day\nin there, escaping the harsh heat. He&rsquo;d moved the bed out and laid a picnic\nblanket on the floor with two pillows for them to rest on. His favourite\nguitar, the one that he used to play &ldquo;Oh Anna&rdquo; on tour was sitting in the\ncorner and he had a stack of DVDs sitting on the coffee table, ready for them\nto watch. </p><p>Anna made herself\ncomfortable on the picnic rug and pulled out her laptop. Today was a work day,\nthey&rsquo;d agreed on that before she came over but the weather made it hard to\nfocus and eventually, Anna gave up on the proposal she was working on and sat\nand watched as Harry strummed on his guitar. He wasn&rsquo;t doing anything in\nparticular, just recording a few new riffs that he might be able to use for new\nsongs when he finally gets back into the studio. He had his brown leather\nnotebook laid out and was scrawling lone lyrics down as they came to him but\nAnna had other ideas for the page and she began doodling all over it, mostly\ntiny little cartoons of the two of them together and a few other little\ncharacters.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you\ncould draw&rdquo; Harry said after watching her for a while </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really, I\nhave a doctors appointment tomorrow&rdquo; Anna said softly when Harry stopped\nstrumming his guitar, &ldquo;Trying to keep myself distracted&rdquo;</p><p>He put the guitar\ndown and looked at her &ldquo;Do you want me to come?&rdquo; </p><p>Anna stayed quiet for\na moment mulling over her answer &ldquo;I think so&rdquo; she finally uttered </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to&rdquo; he\nsaid &ldquo;But I know you&rsquo;re nervous&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I want you to&rdquo;\nshe smiled &ldquo;It&rsquo;s at 11:30&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stay here tonight,\nI&rsquo;ll cook us breakfast in the morning&rdquo; he leant over and kissed her forehead\n&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s going to be fine An&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks H&rdquo; she closed\nher laptop and laid down on the picnic blanket, staring up at the roof. The air\noutside had cooled slightly and in the distance dark clouds were rolling in\nbringing with them the cool change that they so desperately waited for. </p><p>Thunder storms had\nalways been Anna&rsquo;s favourite part of Summer, she loved how the world went dark\njust beforehand, like the city had suddenly been taken over by dementors, and\nthe rain. She loved watching the rain fall down, and on a day like today, she\nloved to sit out in it and cool down. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outside&rdquo;\nshe said after a few minutes of silence after their last conversation. </p><p>Harry stood and\nopened the blinds revealing the dark sky &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about to rain love&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly&rdquo; she stood\nand held her hand out, enticing him to grab on. He did, shrugging and grabbing\nhis phone off the floor as Anna dragged him out of the room. She went straight\nfor the back door, but Harry pulled her back towards the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;No no no&rdquo; he smiled\n&ldquo;if we&rsquo;re going to be out in the rain, we&rsquo;re doing it right&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The rain is that\nway&rdquo; Anna giggled pointing at the back door. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope&rdquo; he kept\nwalking up the stairs &ldquo;I have a rooftop garden&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you do&rdquo;\nshe rolled her eyes. </p><p>They climbed the\nstairs to the second floor where Harry&rsquo;s bedroom was and then he dragged her up\npast his office and the guest bedrooms on the third floor and up to the fourth\nwhere Anna had never been before. There wasn&rsquo;t much to it, a sitting room with\na grand piano and some artwork, which Anna guessed was worth more than\neverything she owned and then some. Thunder roared just as Harry unlocked the\ndoor to the rooftop and he flinched a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Not scared of\nthunder are you Styles?&rdquo; Anna giggled, walking backwards out into the storm </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; he huffed,\noffended that she thought he was scared of anything. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever&rdquo; she turned\naround and took in the view, clouds still rolling in over the city, which was\nalmost entirely visible from there. </p><p>&ldquo;This might just be\nthe best view in London&rdquo; she said, turning around and looking at it from all\nangles. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; he said, his\ngaze focused not on the skyline that surrounded them, but on Anna who was\ncompletely oblivious to the fact. </p><p>A few lone drops\nstarted to fall from the sky and Anna stretched her arms out to catch them and\nthen the lone drops turned into a flood of water falling from the sky and she\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop herself from laughing. Harry was still standing under the eves of\nthe house, watching Anna enjoy the storm, a huge smile stretched across his\nface. </p><p>&ldquo;Get your butt out\nhere Styles&rdquo; she said through her giggles, holding her hand out and grabbing\nonto his. Reluctantly he followed and rain fell down his back, cooling his\nwhole body and turning his white shirt transparent, revealing his chest full of\ntattoos. With Anna&rsquo;s hand already in his he pulled her in closer to him, so\nthat they were standing only inches away from each other. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit&rdquo; Anna\nwhispered, pulling him down to the ground with her. Their bodies were entirely\nsoaked by now, their hair sticking to their faces and dripping down their\nbacks. Lightning flashed across the sky, turning the clouds from black to\npurple and Anna rested her head on Harry&rsquo;s shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this beautiful\nH?&rdquo; she whispered, looking up at him. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful An&rdquo;\nhe kissed her forehead and used his pointer finger to lift her chin so that she\nwas looking directly at him. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you Anna\nLouise Elliot&rdquo; </p><p>There they were.\nThose three words she&rsquo;d wanted to say for weeks now, finally rolling off his\ntongue, sending shivers down her spine. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Harry\nEdward Styles&rdquo; she giggled &ldquo;always will&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Elliot&rdquo; Anna&rsquo;s\ndoctor poked her head around the corner and ushered both her and Harry into the\nroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Just here for a\ncheck up today love?&rdquo; she smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Anna\nblushed &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been having these stomach pains for a while now, they were going\naway but now it&rsquo;s constant&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ok&rdquo; Doctor O&rsquo;connell\nsaid, in a soft, sweet tone that only emphasized her Irish accent &ldquo;Do you\nremember when it started?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Back in June, it\nstarted as a migraine&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s your\nappetite been?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not great this week,\neven the thought of food makes me ill&rdquo; </p><p>She nodded, taking\nsome notes on her computer &ldquo;When was your last period love?&rdquo; </p><p>Anna&rsquo;s eyes widened\n&ldquo;Two months ago&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is there a chance\nyou could be pregnant?&rdquo; </p><p>Anna and Harry looked\nat each other, both of them blushing. Harry&rsquo;s hand moved onto Anna&rsquo;s knee, a\ngesture of comfort. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I could be?&rdquo;\n&nbsp;Anna said, embarrassed that she hadn&rsquo;t thought of that before now. </p><p>&ldquo;When was the last\ntime you had sex?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Last Night&rdquo; they\nboth said quietly but in unison. </p><p>&ldquo;And before that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Friday&rdquo; Harry said\nbefore clearing his throat </p><p>&ldquo;Are you using\nCondoms?&rdquo; Dr O&rsquo;Connell asked, looking at them over her glasses </p><p>They both nodded but\ndidn&rsquo;t say anything, too shocked by the thought of a baby.</p><p>&ldquo;Right well there&rsquo;s\nalways a chance, so let&rsquo;s rule that out before we go looking for something\nelse&rdquo; She turned in her chair and opened the drawer sitting next to her desk,\npulling out a specimen jar and slammed it down on the desk next to Anna. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bathroom\njust down the hall, bring this back when you&rsquo;re finished&rdquo; </p><p>She took the jar and\nstood from her chair, passed her handbag to Harry without and word and walked\nout of the room. This couldn&rsquo;t be real. A baby? How could she be a mother, she\ncould barely look after herself and how could Harry be a dad? He was too busy\nwith work to be able to give the child enough of his time, christ even\nyesterday when Anna was over he couldn&rsquo;t leave his guitar alone long enough for\nthem to have a full conversation. Not that she minded, she loved it when he\nsang. They&rsquo;d been so careful she wasn&rsquo;t on the pill, but they always, always\nused condoms. There was no way there could be a baby in there.</p><p>She slid back into Dr\nO'connell&rsquo;s office after using the bathroom, with the jar in her hand and\nplaced it back on the desk, red faced with embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;Right then&rdquo; the\ndoctor said warmly as she put on a pair of gloves &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out if there&rsquo;s a\nbaby in there.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry held on tightly\nto Anna knee while they waited for the results to show up on the test stick.\nAnna&rsquo;s heart was practically beating out of her chest and Harry couldn&rsquo;t stop\npulling his lip with his free hand. It took three minutes for the results to\nshow, but it felt like three hours and by the time Dr O'connell opened her\nmouth Anna felt like she was about to throw up. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s negative&rdquo; she\nsaid </p><p>They both let out a\ndeep sigh. Thank God. Now wasn&rsquo;t the time for babies. Harry loosened his grip\non Anna&rsquo;s knee but kept his hand there, because if there was no baby, there was\nsomething else. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s talk more\nabout these stomach pains then because missing two periods isn&rsquo;t a good sign,\nwhat kind of pain is it?&rdquo; she was speaking with a tone of concern now, instead\nof excitement. </p><p>&ldquo;Usually, it&rsquo;s a dull\nache all over, but when it gets worse it&rsquo;s sharp and on my sides&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm&rdquo; she tapped her\npen on the desk &ldquo;could be kidney&rsquo;s, why don&rsquo;t you pop up on that bed over there\nand I&rsquo;ll examine you&rdquo; </p><p>Anna stood up again\nand walked over to the examination table. Kidney&rsquo;s. Couldn&rsquo;t they go back to\nthe baby idea? That was way less scary. She laid down on the sterilised paper\nsheets and lifted her shirt just below her bra. Dr O'connell drew the curtains\nso that Harry couldn&rsquo;t see and began pressing on Anna&rsquo;s belly. </p><p>&ldquo;You tell me where it\nhurts love&rdquo; she said softly</p><p>&ldquo;Everywhere&rdquo; she\nchoked until she pressed on her left side, &ldquo;There&rdquo; she squeaked &ldquo;That hurts&rdquo; </p><p>Dr O&rsquo;Connell took her\nhands away and helped Anna sit up. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok, next step is to\ntake some bloods and we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s going on inside. Are you ok with\nneedles?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Anna shook her\nhead </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s\nfor&rdquo; she drew the curtains back and smiled at Harry. &ldquo;Your presence is required\ngood sir&rdquo; </p><p>Harry giggled &ldquo;What\nare boyfriends for&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hold her hand and\ntell her she&rsquo;s pretty while I get things ready&rdquo; </p><p>There was a reason\nAnna like Dr O'Connell so much, and it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily because of her\nmedical expertise, it was more her bedside manner. She always made Anna laugh\nand that made everything less scary. </p><p>&ldquo;You are very pretty&rdquo;\nHarry said &ldquo;Even if you do look a little pale right now&rdquo; </p><p>Anna smiled\nsheepishly and grabbed onto Harry&rsquo;s outstretched hand &ldquo;I hate needles&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a tiny\npinch, and you can squeeze my hand as hard as you need to&rdquo; </p><p>The Doctor walked\nback over to them with a tray of all the things that she needed to take Anna&rsquo;s\nblood. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten good at\nthis over the years love, you won&rsquo;t even feel it&rdquo; she said reassuringly,\npulling a pair of gloves over her hands and using an alcohol wipe to sterilise\nthe area. Anna held tightly onto to Harry&rsquo;s hand and squeezed her eyes shut so\nthat she didn&rsquo;t have to watch what was happening. A tiny sting in her left arm\nlet her know that needle was in and before she knew it Dr O'connell was\nfinished. </p><p>&ldquo;All done dear&rdquo; she\nsmiled. &ldquo;Come back and sit down over near the desk and we&rsquo;ll go over what\nhappens next&rdquo; </p><p>They both followed\nher back and sat down. Anna didn&rsquo;t know how she felt at this point, she thought\nshe was nervous, but she didn&rsquo;t know if that was just the pains coming back\nagain. </p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Anna\nthere&rsquo;s not much more I can do for you until we get your blood work back, but I\nwant to send you for an ultrasound on your kidneys as well see if we can get a\nbetter idea of what&rsquo;s causing you all this pain.&rdquo; She turned to her computer\nand printed out an order for the ultrasound and handed it to Anna. &ldquo;You make\nsure you&rsquo;re drinking plenty of fluids in this weather, you need to stay\nhydrated&rdquo; She stood from her chair, which promoted Anna and Harry to do the\nsame </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for all of\nyour help Dr O&rsquo;Connell&rdquo; Anna said </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my pleasure\ndear, it will take a day or two, but I&rsquo;ll give you a call with your results,\nand you make that appointment for that scan as soon as you can&rdquo; She ushered\nthem out the door </p><p>&ldquo;I will&rdquo; Anna smiled\n&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; </p><p>*** </p><p>&ldquo;Those one&rsquo;s&rdquo; Harry\nsaid pointing to the red pair of sunglasses that sat on Anna&rsquo;s dressing table </p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Anna\nquestioned &ldquo;You think she&rsquo;ll like them?</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll like you so\nit doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo; &nbsp;he checked his phone to see that it was already twenty\npast eleven &ldquo;she won&rsquo;t if we&rsquo;re late though, we better get going&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fine&rdquo; Anna huffed\npushing the sunglasses onto her face </p><p>&ldquo;You look stunning as\nalways, plus she&rsquo;s my sister so she doesn&rsquo;t care what you look like&rdquo;</p><p>Anna was finally\ngetting to meet Gemma, and to say that she was nervous was an understatement.\nShe knew how much his family meant to Harry and she also knew much he cared\nwhat they thought. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you got your\nphone love?&rdquo; He asked before closing the door to her flat </p><p>&ldquo;When do I not have\nmy phone?&rdquo; she giggled </p><p>&ldquo;Just checking, Dr\nO'connell might ring back, that&rsquo;s all&rdquo;</p><p>That was the last\nthing she needed to be reminded of right now, but it had been a few days since\nher appointment and the blood results would be back any time now. </p><p>They weren&rsquo;t doing\nanything overly exciting with Gemma, just a pub lunch, Charli had even agreed\nto join them and take the pressure off a little. It didn&rsquo;t help that Anna\nwasn&rsquo;t feeling well anyway, but when they walked in and saw that Gemma was\nalready sitting at the bar, Anna&rsquo;s stomach dropped.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little early\nfor wine isn&rsquo;t Gems?&rdquo; Harry said, startling her. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was\ngetting close to five, you&rsquo;re so late&rdquo; she said sarcastically although Anna was\npretty sure she wasn&rsquo;t joking</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; Harry sighed\n&ldquo;My fault, couldn&rsquo;t find my car keys&rdquo; </p><p>She shrugged and Anna\nlet go of the breath that she&rsquo;d taken when Gemma mentioned being late, grateful\nthat Harry had taken the blame. </p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you\nin months, where&rsquo;s my hug?&rdquo; she said. </p><p>Harry obliged and\nwrapped his arms around her. It warmed Anna&rsquo;s heart how close they were, even\nafter spending months apart they could go back to being the best of friends,\nwhich said something about them both as people. </p><p>As they pulled away\nfrom the hug, Gemma turned straight to Anna and held out her hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gemma, it&rsquo;s nice\nto finally meet you, this dickhead hasn&rsquo;t shut up about you since he met you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Likewise&rdquo; Anna\nsmiled &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Anna by the way&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know hun&rdquo; Gemma\nnodded. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s find somewhere to sit, shall we?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outside,\nit&rsquo;s too nice out to be inside&rdquo; Anna added, needing the fresh air to calm her\nnerves. </p><p>&ldquo;Good idea&rdquo; Harry\nnodded and grabbed onto her hand. </p><p>Once they found a\nseat and ordered their meals, Anna began to ease into the conversation and by\nthe time Charli arrived, Anna couldn&rsquo;t remember why she was so nervous about\nthis, Gemma was just as lovely as Harry. She wasn&rsquo;t over protective of him, she\ndidn&rsquo;t question why Anna was with him and maybe that was because she could see\nthat he was totally in love with her and that&rsquo;s all that matters. </p><p>&ldquo;Hiya&rdquo; Charli said as\nshe made her way over to their table &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so so sorry I&rsquo;m late, got stuck in a\nmeeting&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Happens to the best\nof us&rdquo; Harry said, smiling at her </p><p>&ldquo;I ordered you some\nvegetarian lasagna&rdquo; Anna said, moving closer to Harry so that Charli could sit\ndown next to her </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Charli,&rdquo; she\nsaid to Gemma &ldquo;Anna&rsquo;s manger slash best friend&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gemma&rdquo; she said\nin response &ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s sister slash life coach&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bold\nstatement&rdquo; Harry chimed in &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let jeffy hear you say that&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aww, I miss Jeffy&rdquo;\nGemma sighed &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; </p><p>Conversion continued\nto flow easily as Harry and Anna recapped the tour, and Gemma and Charli filled\nthem both in on what they&rsquo;d missed in London while they&rsquo;d been gone. There were\ntimes when they would break into two separate conversations but it always came\nback to the four of them and Harry always kept his hand on Anna&rsquo;s knee.</p><p>Their food arrived\nand everyone started eating but the smell of it made Anna feel ill and she was\nonly a few bites in before she had to stop. Harry knew not to say anything in\nfront of Gemma, but he gave her a worried look that she just shrugged off, not\nbeing able to do anything about it right now. </p><p>&ldquo;That looks good, An&rdquo;\nHarry said, a mouth still half full of his own lunch &ldquo;Can I steal some?&rdquo; </p><p> She could see what he was doing and she played\nalong &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever eat your own food?&rdquo; she said sarcastically to make the\nwhole thing look more real. </p><p>&ldquo;Yours looks better&rdquo;\nhe shrugged reaching over and taking some chips from her plate </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always been\nlike this&rdquo; Gemma added, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t settle until he&rsquo;s tried everyone&rsquo;s food&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want any of\nyours&rdquo; he said, using his fork to take a mouthful of pasta from Anna&rsquo;s plate.\nHe continued to subtly take her food, until her plate was almost empty and her\nphone started to ring. His grip tightened on her knee when he saw that the\nnumber on her screen was Dr O'Connell&rsquo;s. She looked at him nervously before she\npicked it up and stood from her seat at the table, walking away so that they\ncouldn&rsquo;t hear her conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Anna\nspeaking&rdquo; she said, her voice shaking a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi Anna dear, It&rsquo;s\nDr O&rsquo;connell, is now a good time to talk?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, now&rsquo;s fine&rdquo; her\nheart was beating out of her chest and she barely form a coherent thought </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just had a look\nat your blood results and there&rsquo;s a few abnormalities, I&rsquo;ll need you to come in\nas soon as possible for some more tests&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right&rdquo; Anna breathed\n</p><p>&ldquo;I know that sounds\nscary love, but it&rsquo;s not all that bad, I&rsquo;m going to need to see you again as\nsoon as possible for some more testing and to see if we can get you started on\ntreatment. How does tomorrow at 8:15 sound?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; Anna said </p><p>&ldquo;Ok love, see you\nthen and bring that nice handsome boy with you to hold your hand&rdquo; </p></p>",

London had suffered through weeks of abnormally hot weather and now she\nwas counting down the days until Autumn began. Her flat was on the 5th floor of\nher building and she just couldn&rsquo;t cool it down no matter how hard she tried,\nand Harry&rsquo;s house wasn&rsquo;t much better, but there were at least a few rooms that\ndidn&rsquo;t get direct sunlight that they could hide away in. The only problem was,\nHarry lived on the other side of London and that meant that a long stuffy tube\nride to get there and she knew that would probably give her another headache,\nbut if she wanted to be cool, she didn&rsquo;t really have another choice. So she\ngathered her things together and made sure she got her cold bottle of water out\nof the fridge and locked the door behind her. </p>\n<p>The heat hit her as\nsoon as she left the building, and she let out an audible huff which made\npassers by turn their heads and nod at her, acknowledging their own disgust for\nthe hot air. It was a slow walk to the underground but by the time she got\nthere she was already covered in a film of sweat and she couldn&rsquo;t wait to get\nto Harry&rsquo;s. She sat down sat down in the corner of the compartment and pulled\nher phone out, putting her headphones in and pressing play on her audiobook,\nhoping that she could focus on something else. With her eyes closed she drifted\ninto a world of her own but it didn&rsquo;t take long for the headache and stomach\npains to set in. She took a sip from her water bottle and drew in a deep breath,\nher hand clenching her stomach waiting for it to subside a little. When it did,\nshe picked her phone up again and sent Harry a message. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can you pick me up\nfrom the station, it&rsquo;s too hot to walk&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, how far\noff are you?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Two stops&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave now then,\nsee you soon xx&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Anna kept taking in\ndeep breathes as she watched out the window at the black tunnell passing by.\nShe knew she&rsquo;d be ok once she was out in the open again but right now she\nwasn&rsquo;t sure she was going to make it without hurling her guts all through the\ntrain compartment. But she did make it and she was the first to get off at her\nstop. The heat in the underground was almost unbearable though and Anna\ncouldn&rsquo;t wait to get outside where there was the slightest breeze to cool her a\nlittle. True to his word, Harry was waiting outside the tube station in his car\nand Anna jogged over to it. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hi Styles&rdquo; she\nhuffed, taking her seat leaning over to kiss his cheek </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bit hot out there?&rdquo;\nhe laughed </p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting,\nalmost puked all over the tube&rdquo; </p>\n<p>His expression fell\nat the mention of Anna being unwell &ldquo;You alright now?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she nodded &ldquo;I\njust needed some air&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Harry&rsquo;s house was\ncool, he had all the blinds and curtains shut off so that the sun couldn&rsquo;t get\nin and his back guest room was set up so that they could spend the entire day\nin there, escaping the harsh heat. He&rsquo;d moved the bed out and laid a picnic\nblanket on the floor with two pillows for them to rest on. His favourite\nguitar, the one that he used to play &ldquo;Oh Anna&rdquo; on tour was sitting in the\ncorner and he had a stack of DVDs sitting on the coffee table, ready for them\nto watch. </p>\n<p>Anna made herself\ncomfortable on the picnic rug and pulled out her laptop. Today was a work day,\nthey&rsquo;d agreed on that before she came over but the weather made it hard to\nfocus and eventually, Anna gave up on the proposal she was working on and sat\nand watched as Harry strummed on his guitar. He wasn&rsquo;t doing anything in\nparticular, just recording a few new riffs that he might be able to use for new\nsongs when he finally gets back into the studio. He had his brown leather\nnotebook laid out and was scrawling lone lyrics down as they came to him but\nAnna had other ideas for the page and she began doodling all over it, mostly\ntiny little cartoons of the two of them together and a few other little\ncharacters.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you\ncould draw&rdquo; Harry said after watching her for a while </p>\n</p>",

Her lips curl more when our eyes meet and surprisingly, mine too.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for the mess.&rdquo; I apologize, pushing on the door and walking in. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to have anyone over.&rdquo; </p><p>She chuckles and her eyes travel around my room as i close the door behind her. I look at her for a few seconds and finally drop my bag in the corner of the room. I make sure my wallet and my phone are in my pockets and look up at her when she turns back to me.</p><p>&ldquo;You should see my room.&rdquo; she lets out, her eyes meeting mine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a messy person, you&rsquo;re just an amateur.&rdquo;</p><p>It makes me laugh as i search on my bed to find a sweater. I finally grab a grey one and smile, walking back up to her. She still looks at my stuff and i find that endearing somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;You live here alone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea.&rdquo; I nod quickly and just shrug. &ldquo;I wanted some privacy this year, so i asked to have my own room.&rdquo;</p><p>Her nose moves up in a grimace and it makes me smile more. I remember she used to do that too when we were young but somehow, now that she&rsquo;s older, it was even more adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky, I have a roommate and she&rsquo;s a real pain in the ass.&rdquo;</p><p>We both laugh a bit and i shrug again as i walk back to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;If you need an escape, you can always crash here.&rdquo; I propose, opening the door before following her outside. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always welcome, don&rsquo;t even hesitate.&rdquo;</p><p>When I turn around, I don&rsquo;t expect her to be so close and out eyes meet. She doesn&rsquo;t back away and I smile fondly, staring at her. My gaze drops to her mouth when she licks her lips and she chuckles again.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, I may actually take you up on that offer.&rdquo;</p><p>It was not something I noticed when we were kids, but now that she was so close to me, I realized how pretty she was. I remain breathless for a few seconds before to let the air out of my lungs with a short laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, that&rsquo;s what friends are for, right?&rdquo; I add awkwardly as she takes a step further. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re probably my oldest friend, so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You never know,&rdquo; she starts, glancing at me with a smirk gracing her lips as we walk back to the car. &ldquo;Maybe we could be best friends again.&rdquo;</p><p>I send her an amused grin and shake my head slightly. This is exactly how I actually remember her and I quite like it.</p><p>&ldquo;You never know.&rdquo; I simply repeat, winking at her and making her laugh.</p><blockquote><p><b>OLIVIA</b></p></blockquote><p>His room was not even messy. Some pieces of clothing here and there and a few books he probably left open after studying was not what i considered &lsquo;a mess&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s nothing compared to the mess of my room. I try to look everywhere in his room, perhaps to get to know him better. I know about the kid he was, but the man he became is still a mystery.</p><p>When we finally get to the restaurant, the waitress brings us to a table in the back and i sit in front of him, a bit speechless.

Her lips curl more when our eyes meet and surprisingly, mine too.</p><p>\u201cSorry for the mess.\u201d I apologize, pushing on the door and walking in. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have anyone over.\u201d </p><p>She chuckles and her eyes travel around my room as i close the door behind her. I look at her for a few seconds and finally drop my bag in the corner of the room. I make sure my wallet and my phone are in my pockets and look up at her when she turns back to me.</p><p>\u201cYou should see my room.\u201d she lets out, her eyes meeting mine. \u201cI\u2019m a messy person, you\u2019re just an amateur.\u201d</p><p>It makes me laugh as i search on my bed to find a sweater. I finally grab a grey one and smile, walking back up to her. She still looks at my stuff and i find that endearing somehow.</p><p>\u201cYou live here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea.\u201d I nod quickly and just shrug. \u201cI wanted some privacy this year, so i asked to have my own room.\u201d</p><p>Her nose moves up in a grimace and it makes me smile more. I remember she used to do that too when we were young but somehow, now that she\u2019s older, it was even more adorable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, I have a roommate and she\u2019s a real pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>We both laugh a bit and i shrug again as i walk back to the door.</p><p>\u201cIf you need an escape, you can always crash here.\u201d I propose, opening the door before following her outside. \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome, don\u2019t even hesitate.\u201d</p><p>When I turn around, I don\u2019t expect her to be so close and out eyes meet. She doesn\u2019t back away and I smile fondly, staring at her. My gaze drops to her mouth when she licks her lips and she chuckles again.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I may actually take you up on that offer.\u201d</p><p>It was not something I noticed when we were kids, but now that she was so close to me, I realized how pretty she was. I remain breathless for a few seconds before to let the air out of my lungs with a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cYea, that\u2019s what friends are for, right?\u201d I add awkwardly as she takes a step further. \u201cAnd you\u2019re probably my oldest friend, so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d she starts, glancing at me with a smirk gracing her lips as we walk back to the car. \u201cMaybe we could be best friends again.\u201d</p><p>I send her an amused grin and shake my head slightly. This is exactly how I actually remember her and I quite like it.</p><p>\u201cYou never know.\u201d I simply repeat, winking at her and making her laugh.</p><blockquote><p><b>OLIVIA</b></p></blockquote><p>His room was not even messy. Some pieces of clothing here and there and a few books he probably left open after studying was not what i considered \u2018a mess\u2019. It\u2019s nothing compared to the mess of my room. I try to look everywhere in his room, perhaps to get to know him better. I know about the kid he was, but the man he became is still a mystery.</p><p>When we finally get to the restaurant, the waitress brings us to a table in the back and i sit in front of him, a bit speechless. I don\u2019t even know where to start. We both grab a menu, probably both a bit shy and i finally put it down and tilt my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want things to be awkward between us, Harry.\u201d</p><p>His head moves up and when he dives his gaze in mine, it makes me smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, Liv.\u201d he assures me, putting his menu away. \u201cI\u2019m actually happy we ran into each other.\u201d</p><p>I make my choice and breathe in, giving him my full attention.
