Harry; slight daddy kink; FLUFF!</b></p><p><b><i>A/N: I\u2019m not really that proud of this one also this reminded me few of my very old writings.</i></b></p><p><i>Y/N had it in her mind for a while.</i></p><p>Four months to be exact. And from these past four months, these thoughts had been swimming in her mind nonstop. If she was with someone she\u2019d just get flustered when she caught herself thinking about it. But when she was alone she\u2019d google it, maybe even take out the dildo she had hidden in her underwear drawer and try on it. But, none of them gave her the peace of mind she wanted. </p><p>She wanted to know if she was actually good at it; wanted to know if she was even doing it right.</p><p>She thought of going to the pub and take a guy for the\u00a0experiment but if she ended up biting on him- <i>well</i> that would be an embarrassment she\u2019d remember forever. And she didn\u2019t want that.\u00a0She really just\u00a0wanted someone to give her a guide while doing it- but as a person who was single, Y/N realized it was too much to ask. So she settled on some advice.</p><p>She decided to go to her best friend but it was already two months that she decided on it.</p><p>She tried to talk about it quite a few times actually. Starting from watching an intense scene together to having breakfast together- she tried to bring it up. But at the very last moment, she always bailed out. She didn\u2019t know why,\u00a0though.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that they never talked about sex, They clearly did but this particular time\u00a0she was just so fucking nervous. Maybe it was because she was putting too much thought in it or maybe because she figured out that it would <i>somehow</i> end differently.</p><p>Now as she laid on the couch, head resting on his thighs, his hand playing with her hair while \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 played on the TV - she had these urge to talk about this, again.</p><p>However, today she was pretty determined. She was going to spill out those words out -one way or another.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d she called in a small voice. Nonetheless, Harry heard it as he hummed but his eyes still fixed on the TV screen. However, when he didn\u2019t hear Y/N ask about anything at all he looked down at her. And to his surprise, her cheeks were slightly pink, ears crimson red as she bites on her lips hard. And honestly, Harry was confused as to what made her this flustered.</p><p>He clearly saw her in this state every now and then. Once it was for a guy she really liked in her college. She was blabbering about how amazing he was to Harry with a huge grin on her face - lips between her teeth and cheeks flustered. And if Harry was honest there was a pang of jealousy in her chest as he told her \u2018he might be the one\u2019.</p><p>And the most recent one was when they were watching Fifty Shades Of Grey. Y/N hadn\u2019t watched it before and really wanted to see why people were so hyped about it. Especially because she hated the book, and didn\u2019t see why they\u2019d even make a film on it. However, that didn\u2019t stop her from getting flustered, during the sex scene. And, Harry swore he heard Y/N\u2019s breath hitched the moment Christian\u00a0took an ice cube in his mouth and then swirled it around Anastasia\u2019s nipple. And Harry would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t want to just tie her up and just do the same.</p><p>But, seeing her then like that - he was pretty confused. They weren\u2019t watching anything like fifty shades of grey nor Y/N was gushing about a cute guy in her college. Or maybe she would then, and maybe that is why she called him so timidly and then went completely silent. And honestly, Harry hated the idea. He couldn\u2019t sit through another one hour of her talking about a guy she might be in love with. Last time he used every last bit of his will power to not just kiss her there and tell her he was utterly in love with her and no one could love her as he did. But clearly, his love was unrequited. So, he did what he thought was best and tried to push all his feeling away. But Harry swore if he had to sit through another one of her &lsquo;he\u2019s really amazing\u2019 he was going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Harry slowly brushed a strand of her hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI uh, I need some advice -tips,\u201d Y/N slowly sat up and looked down at her lap as she played with her fingers. She was nervous - Harry could tell.</p><p>\u201cOn what, love?\u201d Harry tried to look at her eyes but her gaze was fixed on her lap.</p><p>\u201cI - I - can you tell-\u201d she finally looked up at him but she only got completely silent. As her skin got red as crimson.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Forget it,\u201d she diverted her eyes again and looked at the TV screen and unintentionally shifted away.</p><p>Harry knew her enough to know it wasn\u2019t about a boy. Even though he was relieved,\u00a0he was concerned, what happened or made her so hesitant. And Harry feared that she might have gotten herself in some sort of trouble.</p><p>\u201cHey, what happened? You can tell me anything you know?\u201d Harry scooped a little closure to her and put his hand on her knee in a comforting manner, but that only got Y/N more flustered. She could almost feel her skin burn under his touch as she could feel her panties go damp</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really,\u201d she tried again. But this time she looked directly into his eyes and by the stern look he was giving her, she knew he wasn\u2019t letting it go until she spilled out the truth.</p><p>So, she let out a sigh in defeat. \u201cI was just wondering if you could give me some advice on -\u201d she looked up at him almost pleadingly but he only said 'shoot\u2019. So finding no other way she closed her eyes and said it. \u201cAdviceonhowtogivesomeoneablowjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Harry only looked at her eyebrows, as he tried to remember or even understand what his best friend just said.</p><p>Y/N sighed again looking down at her lap. \u201cI was wondering if you could give me some advice or tips on how to give someone a blowjob,\u201d she spoke much clearly and much slower this time so Harry could understand.</p><p>And he definitely did. His grip on Y/N knees got a little tighter -Y/N could feel the sweat of his palm; his eyes went wide and his breathing hitched.</p><p>Harry looked at her for a while.</p><p>\u201cI uh,\u201d Harry gulped just before letting out a cough. He didn\u2019t know either, why it was so awkward, hell they talked about more intimate stuff before, it wasn\u2019t any different -but for some reason it was.\u201cI um - what you need to know?\u201d he asked as he shifted a little nervously, abruptly taking his hand away from Y/N\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cJust how - you know how to do it well?\u201d Y/N fiddled with her fingers nervously.</p><p>\u201cUm - use your tongue, use your hands for the place you can\u2019t reach,\u201d Harry said somewhat awkwardly as he tried to avoid to look at Y/N completely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m scared,\u201d this time Y/N let out a groan and completely slumped down on the couch. \u201cWhat if I bite on him accidentally, and hurt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you won\u2019t,\u201d Harry said finally looking at Y/N. \u201cWhere is this coming from anyways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Josh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat douchbag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well before leaving he said, he\u2019d find someone who could actually give a blowjob-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even though he was a douchbag, he was kinda right. I can\u2019t give a blowjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s completely fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I guess, but you know I wanna do it,\u201d Y/N let out a sigh as she rested her head over the\u00a0couch and looked up.</p><p>No one said anything for a while. Y/\u00a0 looked at the ceiling as she thought while Harry played with a paper-weight on the coffee table. The silence was all over pleasant, not an awkward or tensed one Harry thought it would be. </p><p>\u201cCan you teach me?\u201d Those words left before Y/N could even comprehend.</p><p>Both Y/N\u2019s and Harry\u2019s eyes went wide. </p><p>\u201cI- \u2019m sorry,\u201d Y/N quickly said but it was as if Harry didn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to teach you?\u201d Harry asked looking at her intently. But, it wasn\u2019t just any other stern look he ever gave, it was lustful.</p><p>Y/N swallowed hard. The look was enough to make her knee quiver and send chills down her spine to her heated core.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. \u201cForget that.\u201d </p><p>She quickly got up. But before she could walk away Harry grabbed her wrist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry slowly made Y/N stand between his legs as he got hold of both of her wrists. \u201cYou want me to teach you?\u201d</p><p>Y/N opened her mouth to tell him to forget it again but before she could reply Harry spoke.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>It was the way he spoke, stern and strict; her name rolling out of his tongue as if he owned her. And honestly, Y/N forgot how to speak. </p><p>So she nodded ever so slightly.</p><p>Harry let go of her wrists and slowly bought them down to the side of her thighs as his eyes slowly scanned down her body.</p><p>Harry honestly didn\u2019t remember when he started to fall for his best friend. It was probably when she lends him the biggest crayon box he had ever seen and didn\u2019t get angry when he lost half of it. Or it was when she punched this guy in the face in middle school when he came to pick on him. Or it was when she climbed up a tree to his room with a box of ice cream after he had his heart broken and just let him cry. Or it was when she came to his place and stayed with him for over two weeks after his step father\u2019s death, just to make sure he was taking care of himself. </p><p>Or maybe it was everything together that made him fall in love with her. Whatever it was, he was completely and utterly in love with her.</p><p>And as his eyes scanned every curve of her body, there was lust, no doubt. But, underneath layed adoration and awe as to how someone as beautiful as her could even be real.</p><p>\u201cWell, If you want me to teach you, I think you should be on your knees now,\u201d his eyes locked with hers as he slowly made circles on her exposed thighs making goosebumps appear.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s heart was hammering against her chest. She honestly thought it was one of her dreams and that she\u2019d wake up just before she took his pants off. But this time it looked so fucking real. The details of everything felt so real. His touch felt so real, the feeling itself felt so real.</p><p>It had to be true.</p><p>And honestly, if it ended up as one of her dreams, she\u2019d literally break into tears.</p><p>Y/N slowly sank down on her knees, eyes fixed on his now dark pupil.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Those two words alone made Y/N squeeze her leg shut and let out a mewl\u00a0as she bit her lower lip in the process. And seeing a smirk appear on his face, she knew - Harry knew what he was doing to her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly caressing her cheek with the back of his fingers. \u201cSlowly take my pants off, now.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft yet demanding. </p><p>Y/N had always been the submissive one. But, she never knew she liked to be dominated that much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too shy and cute to be the dominant one,\u201d Harry would tell her during their midnight conversation making Y/N pout. Which would earn, \u201csee you\u2019re too cute,\u201d and he\u2019d poke her cheek lightly laughing at her adoringly.</p><p>Y/N slowly ran her hand up Harry\u2019s thighs and slowly towards the band of his sweatpants, and she might or might not have slightly brushed her fingers over his very prominent bulge making Harry hiss slightly and grab on Y/N\u2019s hair roughly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna play with me, baby,\u201d he told her. \u201cNow, be a good girl and take my pants off.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was looking directly looking at his eyes as she took his pants off along with his boxer making his cock spring up to his stomach.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes went wide as she realized just how big he was.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he asked as he slowly took his pre-cum in his finger before taking it to her mouth. Y/N sucked on his finger hungrily.</p><p>\u201cHow does it taste?\u201d he asked as/N stilled sucked on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cGood daddy, a little salty,\u201d Harry smirked at that.</p><p>Harry had once expressed he liked to be called daddy in bed and honestly Y/N wanted to please his daddy.</p><p>\u201cNow take it in your mouth, slowly,\u201d he said, slightly letting go of his grip on her head but still having a possessive hold on it.</p><p>Y/N slowly leaned forward as she slowly ran her fingers up and down his length before kissing the red tip. </p><p>\u201cNo playing,\u201d Harry warned. But both of them knew he was enjoying it very much.</p><p>Y/N took his tip up in her mouth earning a small, \u201cthat\u2019s right baby\u201d with a moan.</p><p>Y/N tried to take him fully at first but that only resulted in her in gagging and taking him out to let out a cough.</p><p>\u201cHey there, easy,\u201d Harry said as he slowly rubbed her back to calm her down.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Harry asked once her cough subsided down. Y/N only nodded before diverting her attention to his cock again. She really wanted to do give someone a blowjob for a while but now as that someone was Harry, she just wanted to make him feel good. And maybe that blowjob would turn into something special someday. What she didn\u2019t know was that it was turning into something special that very day.</p><p>Y/N took a hold of his cock, however before she could take him in he stopped her pulling her hair roughly.</p><p>\u201cOnly take as much you can, don\u2019t be greedy,\u201d he had a cocky smirk then. Y/N almost thought he was going to be soft like he was just a second ago, giving her somewhat the control. But that smirk reminded her who was in control.</p><p>So she whispered a little \u2018okay daddy'\u00a0 and took him just as much as she could and used her hand for the parts she couldn\u2019t reach.</p><p>Harry pulled on her head a little before pushing it again, and soon they found a rhythm sending Harry into complete bliss.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe it\u2019s your first time, doing so good for daddy,\u201d Harry praised her as he let go of her hair so she could do it herself.</p><p>Y/N looked up at him. Even though her mouth was stuffed with his dick, he could tell she was smiling lightly making him smirk but quickly rolled his head back and let out a moan.</p><p>Y/N took that as an encouragement and continued to bob her head up and down his shaft. And within minutes he came, shooting all his cum in her mouth while he let out a loud groan; the whole world out of his sight.</p><p>When Harry\u2019s vision came back he looked down where Y/N was sitting, her mouth full of his cum, as few ran down from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSwallow it,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>So, she did. She slowly took the spilled cum in her thumb before licking it like a kitten.</p><p>Harry let out a chuckle at that. She truly was a kitten.</p><p>Y/N slowly got up from the floor and sat next to Harry, who was still breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d Y/N asked biting at her lower lips.</p><p>Harry laughed out. \u201cFucking good.\u201d</p><p>He slowly rested his head on Y/N\u2019s shoulder as he tried to breathe evenly.</p><p>It was silent then. Only Harry\u2019s deep breaths could be heard while Y/N slowly played with his hair, calming him down. And both of them held a smile, a content one. </p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Y/N said after a while.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead love,\u201d Harry nuzzled closure to her neck as he wrapped his arm around her waist tightly, being the little spoon he usually liked to be. And honestly, Y/N was confused if it was the same person who was ordering her around just a second ago. However, that time it wasn\u2019t her main concern.</p><p>\u201cDoes this -does this mean anything?\u201d</p><p>Harry said nothing for a while. But, then he slowly faced her, smiling brightly and arms wrapped around her small figure.</p><p>Y/N was about to ask him if everything was alright. But he slowly inched closure to her making her breathe hitch and close her eyes. And soon she felt his lips on hers. </p><p>Y/N had never gotten a kiss so soft yet passionate and loving. </p><p>Y/N moaned into the kiss as Harry slowly pushed their body on the couch; his hand came up to her jaw and cupped it. Honestly, none of them ever felt anything like this before.</p><p>They don\u2019t know how long they stayed like this. But when Harry broke the kiss, Y/N just wanted more.</p><p>\u201cDoes that answer?\u201d Harry asked resting his forehead against hers. This time she said nothing. She just smiled before leaning for another kiss.</p>",

She was nervous - Harry could tell.</p><p>\u201cOn what, love?\u201d Harry tried to look at her eyes but her gaze was fixed on her lap.</p><p>\u201cI - I - can you tell-\u201d she finally looked up at him but she only got completely silent. As her skin got red as crimson.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Forget it,\u201d she diverted her eyes again and looked at the TV screen and unintentionally shifted away.</p><p>Harry knew her enough to know it wasn\u2019t about a boy. Even though he was relieved,\u00a0he was concerned, what happened or made her so hesitant. And Harry feared that she might have gotten herself in some sort of trouble.</p><p>\u201cHey, what happened? You can tell me anything you know?\u201d Harry scooped a little closure to her and put his hand on her knee in a comforting manner, but that only got Y/N more flustered. She could almost feel her skin burn under his touch as she could feel her panties go damp</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really,\u201d she tried again. But this time she looked directly into his eyes and by the stern look he was giving her, she knew he wasn\u2019t letting it go until she spilled out the truth.</p><p>So, she let out a sigh in defeat. \u201cI was just wondering if you could give me some advice on -\u201d she looked up at him almost pleadingly but he only said 'shoot\u2019. So finding no other way she closed her eyes and said it. \u201cAdviceonhowtogivesomeoneablowjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Harry only looked at her eyebrows, as he tried to remember or even understand what his best friend just said.</p><p>Y/N sighed again looking down at her lap. \u201cI was wondering if you could give me some advice or tips on how to give someone a blowjob,\u201d she spoke much clearly and much slower this time so Harry could understand.</p><p>And he definitely did. His grip on Y/N knees got a little tighter -Y/N could feel the sweat of his palm; his eyes went wide and his breathing hitched.</p><p>Harry looked at her for a while.</p><p>\u201cI uh,\u201d Harry gulped just before letting out a cough. He didn\u2019t know either, why it was so awkward, hell they talked about more intimate stuff before, it wasn\u2019t any different -but for some reason it was.\u201cI um - what you need to know?\u201d he asked as he shifted a little nervously, abruptly taking his hand away from Y/N\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cJust how - you know how to do it well?\u201d Y/N fiddled with her fingers nervously.</p><p>\u201cUm - use your tongue, use your hands for the place you can\u2019t reach,\u201d Harry said somewhat awkwardly as he tried to avoid to look at Y/N completely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m scared,\u201d this time Y/N let out a groan and completely slumped down on the couch. \u201cWhat if I bite on him accidentally, and hurt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you won\u2019t,\u201d Harry said finally looking at Y/N. \u201cWhere is this coming from anyways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Josh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat douchbag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well before leaving he said, he\u2019d find someone who could actually give a blowjob-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even though he was a douchbag, he was kinda right. I can\u2019t give a blowjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s completely fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I guess, but you know I wanna do it,\u201d Y/N let out a sigh as she rested her head over the\u00a0couch and looked up.</p><p>No one said anything for a while. Y/\u00a0 looked at the ceiling as she thought while Harry played with a paper-weight on the coffee table. The silence was all over pleasant, not an awkward or tensed one Harry thought it would be. </p><p>\u201cCan you teach me?\u201d Those words left before Y/N could even comprehend.</p><p>Both Y/N\u2019s and Harry\u2019s eyes went wide. </p><p>\u201cI- \u2019m sorry,\u201d Y/N quickly said but it was as if Harry didn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to teach you?\u201d Harry asked looking at her intently. But, it wasn\u2019t just any other stern look he ever gave, it was lustful.</p><p>Y/N swallowed hard. The look was enough to make her knee quiver and send chills down her spine to her heated core.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. \u201cForget that.\u201d </p><p>She quickly got up. But before she could walk away Harry grabbed her wrist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry slowly made Y/N stand between his legs as he got hold of both of her wrists. \u201cYou want me to teach you?\u201d</p><p>Y/N opened her mouth to tell him to forget it again but before she could reply Harry spoke.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>It was the way he spoke, stern and strict; her name rolling out of his tongue as if he owned her. And honestly, Y/N forgot how to speak. </p><p>So she nodded ever so slightly.</p><p>Harry let go of her wrists and slowly bought them down to the side of her thighs as his eyes slowly scanned down her body.</p><p>Harry honestly didn\u2019t remember when he started to fall for his best friend. It was probably when she lends him the biggest crayon box he had ever seen and didn\u2019t get angry when he lost half of it. Or it was when she punched this guy in the face in middle school when he came to pick on him. Or it was when she climbed up a tree to his room with a box of ice cream after he had his heart broken and just let him cry. Or it was when she came to his place and stayed with him for over two weeks after his step father\u2019s death, just to make sure he was taking care of himself. </p><p>Or maybe it was everything together that made him fall in love with her. Whatever it was, he was completely and utterly in love with her.</p><p>And as his eyes scanned every curve of her body, there was lust, no doubt. But, underneath layed adoration and awe as to how someone as beautiful as her could even be real.</p><p>\u201cWell, If you want me to teach you, I think you should be on your knees now,\u201d his eyes locked with hers as he slowly made circles on her exposed thighs making goosebumps appear.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s heart was hammering against her chest. She honestly thought it was one of her dreams and that she\u2019d wake up just before she took his pants off. But this time it looked so fucking real. The details of everything felt so real. His touch felt so real, the feeling itself felt so real.</p><p>It had to be true.</p><p>And honestly, if it ended up as one of her dreams, she\u2019d literally break into tears.</p><p>Y/N slowly sank down on her knees, eyes fixed on his now dark pupil.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Those two words alone made Y/N squeeze her leg shut and let out a mewl\u00a0as she bit her lower lip in the process. And seeing a smirk appear on his face, she knew - Harry knew what he was doing to her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly caressing her cheek with the back of his fingers. \u201cSlowly take my pants off, now.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft yet demanding. </p><p>Y/N had always been the submissive one. But, she never knew she liked to be dominated that much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too shy and cute to be the dominant one,\u201d Harry would tell her during their midnight conversation making Y/N pout. Which would earn, \u201csee you\u2019re too cute,\u201d and he\u2019d poke her cheek lightly laughing at her adoringly.</p><p>Y/N slowly ran her hand up Harry\u2019s thighs and slowly towards the band of his sweatpants, and she might or might not have slightly brushed her fingers over his very prominent bulge making Harry hiss slightly and grab on Y/N\u2019s hair roughly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna play with me, baby,\u201d he told her. \u201cNow, be a good girl and take my pants off.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was looking directly looking at his eyes as she took his pants off along with his boxer making his cock spring up to his stomach.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes went wide as she realized just how big he was.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he asked as he slowly took his pre-cum in his finger before taking it to her mouth. Y/N sucked on his finger hungrily.</p><p>\u201cHow does it taste?\u201d he asked as/N stilled sucked on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cGood daddy, a little salty,\u201d Harry smirked at that.</p><p>Harry had once expressed he liked to be called daddy in bed and honestly Y/N wanted to please his daddy.</p><p>\u201cNow take it in your mouth, slowly,\u201d he said, slightly letting go of his grip on her head but still having a possessive hold on it.</p><p>Y/N slowly leaned forward as she slowly ran her fingers up and down his length before kissing the red tip. </p><p>\u201cNo playing,\u201d Harry warned. But both of them knew he was enjoying it very much.</p><p>Y/N took his tip up in her mouth earning a small, \u201cthat\u2019s right baby\u201d with a moan.</p><p>Y/N tried to take him fully at first but that only resulted in her in gagging and taking him out to let out a cough.</p><p>\u201cHey there, easy,\u201d Harry said as he slowly rubbed her back to calm her down.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Harry asked once her cough subsided down. Y/N only nodded before diverting her attention to his cock again. She really wanted to do give someone a blowjob for a while but now as that someone was Harry, she just wanted to make him feel good. And maybe that blowjob would turn into something special someday. What she didn\u2019t know was that it was turning into something special that very day.</p><p>Y/N took a hold of his cock, however before she could take him in he stopped her pulling her hair roughly.</p><p>\u201cOnly take as much you can, don\u2019t be greedy,\u201d he had a cocky smirk then. Y/N almost thought he was going to be soft like he was just a second ago, giving her somewhat the control. But that smirk reminded her who was in control.</p><p>So she whispered a little \u2018okay daddy'\u00a0 and took him just as much as she could and used her hand for the parts she couldn\u2019t reach.</p><p>Harry pulled on her head a little before pushing it again, and soon they found a rhythm sending Harry into complete bliss.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe it\u2019s your first time, doing so good for daddy,\u201d Harry praised her as he let go of her hair so she could do it herself.</p><p>Y/N looked up at him. Even though her mouth was stuffed with his dick, he could tell she was smiling lightly making him smirk but quickly rolled his head back and let out a moan.</p><p>Y/N took that as an encouragement and continued to bob her head up and down his shaft. And within minutes he came, shooting all his cum in her mouth while he let out a loud groan; the whole world out of his sight.</p><p>When Harry\u2019s vision came back he looked down where Y/N was sitting, her mouth full of his cum, as few ran down from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSwallow it,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>So, she did. She slowly took the spilled cum in her thumb before licking it like a kitten.</p><p>Harry let out a chuckle at that. She truly was a kitten.</p><p>Y/N slowly got up from the floor and sat next to Harry, who was still breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d Y/N asked biting at her lower lips.</p><p>Harry laughed out. \u201cFucking good.\u201d</p><p>He slowly rested his head on Y/N\u2019s shoulder as he tried to breathe evenly.</p><p>It was silent then. Only Harry\u2019s deep breaths could be heard while Y/N slowly played with his hair, calming him down. And both of them held a smile, a content one. </p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Y/N said after a while.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead love,\u201d Harry nuzzled closure to her neck as he wrapped his arm around her waist tightly, being the little spoon he usually liked to be. And honestly, Y/N was confused if it was the same person who was ordering her around just a second ago. However, that time it wasn\u2019t her main concern.</p><p>\u201cDoes this -does this mean anything?\u201d</p><p>Harry said nothing for a while. But, then he slowly faced her, smiling brightly and arms wrapped around her small figure.</p><p>Y/N was about to ask him if everything was alright. But he slowly inched closure to her making her breathe hitch and close her eyes. And soon she felt his lips on hers. </p><p>Y/N had never gotten a kiss so soft yet passionate and loving. </p><p>Y/N moaned into the kiss as Harry slowly pushed their body on the couch; his hand came up to her jaw and cupped it. Honestly, none of them ever felt anything like this before.</p><p>They don\u2019t know how long they stayed like this. But when Harry broke the kiss, Y/N just wanted more.</p><p>\u201cDoes that answer?\u201d Harry asked resting his forehead against hers. This time she said nothing. She just smiled before leaning for another kiss.</p>",

Harry; slight daddy kink; FLUFF!</b></p><p><b><i>A/N: I\u2019m not really that proud of this one also this reminded me few of my very old writings.</i></b></p><p><i>Y/N had it in her mind for a while.</i></p><p>Four months to be exact. And from these past four months, these thoughts had been swimming in her mind nonstop. If she was with someone she\u2019d just get flustered when she caught herself thinking about it. But when she was alone she\u2019d google it, maybe even take out the dildo she had hidden in her underwear drawer and try on it. But, none of them gave her the peace of mind she wanted. </p><p>She wanted to know if she was actually good at it; wanted to know if she was even doing it right.</p><p>She thought of going to the pub and take a guy for the\u00a0experiment but if she ended up biting on him- <i>well</i> that would be an embarrassment she\u2019d remember forever. And she didn\u2019t want that.\u00a0She really just\u00a0wanted someone to give her a guide while doing it- but as a person who was single, Y/N realized it was too much to ask. So she settled on some advice.</p><p>She decided to go to her best friend but it was already two months that she decided on it.</p><p>She tried to talk about it quite a few times actually. Starting from watching an intense scene together to having breakfast together- she tried to bring it up. But at the very last moment, she always bailed out. She didn\u2019t know why,\u00a0though.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that they never talked about sex, They clearly did but this particular time\u00a0she was just so fucking nervous. Maybe it was because she was putting too much thought in it or maybe because she figured out that it would <i>somehow</i> end differently.</p><p>Now as she laid on the couch, head resting on his thighs, his hand playing with her hair while \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 played on the TV - she had these urge to talk about this, again.</p><p>However, today she was pretty determined. She was going to spill out those words out -one way or another.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d she called in a small voice. Nonetheless, Harry heard it as he hummed but his eyes still fixed on the TV screen. However, when he didn\u2019t hear Y/N ask about anything at all he looked down at her. And to his surprise, her cheeks were slightly pink, ears crimson red as she bites on her lips hard. And honestly, Harry was confused as to what made her this flustered.</p><p>He clearly saw her in this state every now and then. Once it was for a guy she really liked in her college. She was blabbering about how amazing he was to Harry with a huge grin on her face - lips between her teeth and cheeks flustered. And if Harry was honest there was a pang of jealousy in her chest as he told her \u2018he might be the one\u2019.</p><p>And the most recent one was when they were watching Fifty Shades Of Grey. Y/N hadn\u2019t watched it before and really wanted to see why people were so hyped about it. Especially because she hated the book, and didn\u2019t see why they\u2019d even make a film on it. However, that didn\u2019t stop her from getting flustered, during the sex scene. And, Harry swore he heard Y/N\u2019s breath hitched the moment Christian\u00a0took an ice cube in his mouth and then swirled it around Anastasia\u2019s nipple. And Harry would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t want to just tie her up and just do the same.</p><p>But, seeing her then like that - he was pretty confused. They weren\u2019t watching anything like fifty shades of grey nor Y/N was gushing about a cute guy in her college. Or maybe she would then, and maybe that is why she called him so timidly and then went completely silent. And honestly, Harry hated the idea. He couldn\u2019t sit through another one hour of her talking about a guy she might be in love with. Last time he used every last bit of his will power to not just kiss her there and tell her he was utterly in love with her and no one could love her as he did. But clearly, his love was unrequited. So, he did what he thought was best and tried to push all his feeling away. But Harry swore if he had to sit through another one of her \u2018he\u2019s really amazing\u2019 he was going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Harry slowly brushed a strand of her hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI uh, I need some advice -tips,\u201d Y/N slowly sat up and looked down at her lap as she played with her fingers. She was nervous - Harry could tell.</p><p>\u201cOn what, love?\u201d Harry tried to look at her eyes but her gaze was fixed on her lap.</p><p>\u201cI - I - can you tell-\u201d she finally looked up at him but she only got completely silent. As her skin got red as crimson.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Forget it,\u201d she diverted her eyes again and looked at the TV screen and unintentionally shifted away.</p><p>Harry knew her enough to know it wasn\u2019t about a boy. Even though he was relieved,\u00a0he was concerned, what happened or made her so hesitant. And Harry feared that she might have gotten herself in some sort of trouble.</p><p>\u201cHey, what happened? You can tell me anything you know?\u201d Harry scooped a little closure to her and put his hand on her knee in a comforting manner, but that only got Y/N more flustered. She could almost feel her skin burn under his touch as she could feel her panties go damp</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really,\u201d she tried again. But this time she looked directly into his eyes and by the stern look he was giving her, she knew he wasn\u2019t letting it go until she spilled out the truth.</p><p>So, she let out a sigh in defeat. \u201cI was just wondering if you could give me some advice on -\u201d she looked up at him almost pleadingly but he only said 'shoot\u2019. So finding no other way she closed her eyes and said it. \u201cAdviceonhowtogivesomeoneablowjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Harry only looked at her eyebrows, as he tried to remember or even understand what his best friend just said.</p><p>Y/N sighed again looking down at her lap. \u201cI was wondering if you could give me some advice or tips on how to give someone a blowjob,\u201d she spoke much clearly and much slower this time so Harry could understand.</p><p>And he definitely did. His grip on Y/N knees got a little tighter -Y/N could feel the sweat of his palm; his eyes went wide and his breathing hitched.</p><p>Harry looked at her for a while.</p><p>\u201cI uh,\u201d Harry gulped just before letting out a cough. He didn\u2019t know either, why it was so awkward, hell they talked about more intimate stuff before, it wasn\u2019t any different -but for some reason it was.\u201cI um - what you need to know?\u201d he asked as he shifted a little nervously, abruptly taking his hand away from Y/N\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cJust how - you know how to do it well?\u201d Y/N fiddled with her fingers nervously.</p><p>\u201cUm - use your tongue, use your hands for the place you can\u2019t reach,\u201d Harry said somewhat awkwardly as he tried to avoid to look at Y/N completely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m scared,\u201d this time Y/N let out a groan and completely slumped down on the couch. \u201cWhat if I bite on him accidentally, and hurt him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you won\u2019t,\u201d Harry said finally looking at Y/N. \u201cWhere is this coming from anyways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Josh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat douchbag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well before leaving he said, he\u2019d find someone who could actually give a blowjob-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even though he was a douchbag, he was kinda right. I can\u2019t give a blowjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s completely fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I guess, but you know I wanna do it,\u201d Y/N let out a sigh as she rested her head over the\u00a0couch and looked up.</p><p>No one said anything for a while. Y/\u00a0 looked at the ceiling as she thought while Harry played with a paper-weight on the coffee table. The silence was all over pleasant, not an awkward or tensed one Harry thought it would be. </p><p>\u201cCan you teach me?\u201d Those words left before Y/N could even comprehend.</p><p>Both Y/N\u2019s and Harry\u2019s eyes went wide. </p><p>\u201cI- \u2019m sorry,\u201d Y/N quickly said but it was as if Harry didn\u2019t hear her.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to teach you?\u201d Harry asked looking at her intently. But, it wasn\u2019t just any other stern look he ever gave, it was lustful.</p><p>Y/N swallowed hard. The look was enough to make her knee quiver and send chills down her spine to her heated core.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. \u201cForget that.\u201d </p><p>She quickly got up. But before she could walk away Harry grabbed her wrist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry slowly made Y/N stand between his legs as he got hold of both of her wrists. \u201cYou want me to teach you?\u201d</p><p>Y/N opened her mouth to tell him to forget it again but before she could reply Harry spoke.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>It was the way he spoke, stern and strict; her name rolling out of his tongue as if he owned her. And honestly, Y/N forgot how to speak. </p><p>So she nodded ever so slightly.</p><p>Harry let go of her wrists and slowly bought them down to the side of her thighs as his eyes slowly scanned down her body.</p><p>Harry honestly didn\u2019t remember when he started to fall for his best friend. It was probably when she lends him the biggest crayon box he had ever seen and didn\u2019t get angry when he lost half of it. Or it was when she punched this guy in the face in middle school when he came to pick on him. Or it was when she climbed up a tree to his room with a box of ice cream after he had his heart broken and just let him cry. Or it was when she came to his place and stayed with him for over two weeks after his step father\u2019s death, just to make sure he was taking care of himself. </p><p>Or maybe it was everything together that made him fall in love with her. Whatever it was, he was completely and utterly in love with her.</p><p>And as his eyes scanned every curve of her body, there was lust, no doubt. But, underneath layed adoration and awe as to how someone as beautiful as her could even be real.</p><p>\u201cWell, If you want me to teach you, I think you should be on your knees now,\u201d his eyes locked with hers as he slowly made circles on her exposed thighs making goosebumps appear.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s heart was hammering against her chest. She honestly thought it was one of her dreams and that she\u2019d wake up just before she took his pants off. But this time it looked so fucking real. The details of everything felt so real. His touch felt so real, the feeling itself felt so real.</p><p>It had to be true.</p><p>And honestly, if it ended up as one of her dreams, she\u2019d literally break into tears.</p><p>Y/N slowly sank down on her knees, eyes fixed on his now dark pupil.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Those two words alone made Y/N squeeze her leg shut and let out a mewl\u00a0as she bit her lower lip in the process. And seeing a smirk appear on his face, she knew - Harry knew what he was doing to her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said slowly caressing her cheek with the back of his fingers. \u201cSlowly take my pants off, now.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft yet demanding. </p><p>Y/N had always been the submissive one. But, she never knew she liked to be dominated that much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too shy and cute to be the dominant one,\u201d Harry would tell her during their midnight conversation making Y/N pout. Which would earn, \u201csee you\u2019re too cute,\u201d and he\u2019d poke her cheek lightly laughing at her adoringly.</p><p>Y/N slowly ran her hand up Harry\u2019s thighs and slowly towards the band of his sweatpants, and she might or might not have slightly brushed her fingers over his very prominent bulge making Harry hiss slightly and grab on Y/N\u2019s hair roughly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna play with me, baby,\u201d he told her. \u201cNow, be a good girl and take my pants off.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was looking directly looking at his eyes as she took his pants off along with his boxer making his cock spring up to his stomach.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyes went wide as she realized just how big he was.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he asked as he slowly took his pre-cum in his finger before taking it to her mouth. Y/N sucked on his finger hungrily.</p><p>\u201cHow does it taste?\u201d he asked as/N stilled sucked on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cGood daddy, a little salty,\u201d Harry smirked at that.</p><p>Harry had once expressed he liked to be called daddy in bed and honestly Y/N wanted to please his daddy.</p><p>\u201cNow take it in your mouth, slowly,\u201d he said, slightly letting go of his grip on her head but still having a possessive hold on it.</p><p>Y/N slowly leaned forward as she slowly ran her fingers up and down his length before kissing the red tip. </p><p>\u201cNo playing,\u201d Harry warned. But both of them knew he was enjoying it very much.</p><p>Y/N took his tip up in her mouth earning a small, \u201cthat\u2019s right baby\u201d with a moan.</p><p>Y/N tried to take him fully at first but that only resulted in her in gagging and taking him out to let out a cough.</p><p>\u201cHey there, easy,\u201d Harry said as he slowly rubbed her back to calm her down.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Harry asked once her cough subsided down. Y/N only nodded before diverting her attention to his cock again. She really wanted to do give someone a blowjob for a while but now as that someone was Harry, she just wanted to make him feel good. And maybe that blowjob would turn into something special someday. What she didn\u2019t know was that it was turning into something special that very day.</p><p>Y/N took a hold of his cock, however before she could take him in he stopped her pulling her hair roughly.</p><p>\u201cOnly take as much you can, don\u2019t be greedy,\u201d he had a cocky smirk then. Y/N almost thought he was going to be soft like he was just a second ago, giving her somewhat the control. But that smirk reminded her who was in control.</p><p>So she whispered a little \u2018okay daddy'\u00a0 and took him just as much as she could and used her hand for the parts she couldn\u2019t reach.</p><p>Harry pulled on her head a little before pushing it again, and soon they found a rhythm sending Harry into complete bliss.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe it\u2019s your first time, doing so good for daddy,\u201d Harry praised her as he let go of her hair so she could do it herself.</p><p>Y/N looked up at him. Even though her mouth was stuffed with his dick, he could tell she was smiling lightly making him smirk but quickly rolled his head back and let out a moan.</p><p>Y/N took that as an encouragement and continued to bob her head up and down his shaft. And within minutes he came, shooting all his cum in her mouth while he let out a loud groan; the whole world out of his sight.</p><p>When Harry\u2019s vision came back he looked down where Y/N was sitting, her mouth full of his cum, as few ran down from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSwallow it,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>So, she did. She slowly took the spilled cum in her thumb before licking it like a kitten.</p><p>Harry let out a chuckle at that. She truly was a kitten.</p><p>Y/N slowly got up from the floor and sat next to Harry, who was still breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d Y/N asked biting at her lower lips.</p><p>Harry laughed out. \u201cFucking good.\u201d</p><p>He slowly rested his head on Y/N\u2019s shoulder as he tried to breathe evenly.</p><p>It was silent then. Only Harry\u2019s deep breaths could be heard while Y/N slowly played with his hair, calming him down. And both of them held a smile, a content one. </p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Y/N said after a while.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead love,\u201d Harry nuzzled closure to her neck as he wrapped his arm around her waist tightly, being the little spoon he usually liked to be. And honestly, Y/N was confused if it was the same person who was ordering her around just a second ago. However, that time it wasn\u2019t her main concern.</p><p>\u201cDoes this -does this mean anything?\u201d</p><p>Harry said nothing for a while. But, then he slowly faced her, smiling brightly and arms wrapped around her small figure.</p><p>Y/N was about to ask him if everything was alright. But he slowly inched closure to her making her breathe hitch and close her eyes. And soon she felt his lips on hers. </p><p>Y/N had never gotten a kiss so soft yet passionate and loving. </p><p>Y/N moaned into the kiss as Harry slowly pushed their body on the couch; his hand came up to her jaw and cupped it. Honestly, none of them ever felt anything like this before.</p><p>They don\u2019t know how long they stayed like this. But when Harry broke the kiss, Y/N just wanted more.</p><p>\u201cDoes that answer?\u201d Harry asked resting his forehead against hers. This time she said nothing. She just smiled before leaning for another kiss.</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>-the one where Y/N needs some tips on blowjob </i></p><p><b>Before You Read: Smut; bestfriend! Harry; slight daddy kink; FLUFF!</b></p><p><b><i>A/N: I&rsquo;m not really that proud of this one also this reminded me few of my very old writings.</i></b></p><p><i>Y/N had it in her mind for a while.</i></p><p>Four months to be exact. And from these past four months, these thoughts had been swimming in her mind nonstop. If she was with someone she&rsquo;d just get flustered when she caught herself thinking about it. But when she was alone she&rsquo;d google it, maybe even take out the dildo she had hidden in her underwear drawer and try on it. But, none of them gave her the peace of mind she wanted. </p><p>She wanted to know if she was actually good at it; wanted to know if she was even doing it right.</p><p>She thought of going to the pub and take a guy for the&nbsp;experiment but if she ended up biting on him- <i>well</i> that would be an embarrassment she&rsquo;d remember forever. And she didn&rsquo;t want that.&nbsp;She really just&nbsp;wanted someone to give her a guide while doing it- but as a person who was single, Y/N realized it was too much to ask. So she settled on some advice.</p><p>She decided to go to her best friend but it was already two months that she decided on it.</p><p>She tried to talk about it quite a few times actually. Starting from watching an intense scene together to having breakfast together- she tried to bring it up. But at the very last moment, she always bailed out. She didn&rsquo;t know why,&nbsp;though.&nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t that they never talked about sex, They clearly did but this particular time&nbsp;she was just so fucking nervous. Maybe it was because she was putting too much thought in it or maybe because she figured out that it would <i>somehow</i> end differently.</p><p>Now as she laid on the couch, head resting on his thighs, his hand playing with her hair while &lsquo;Legally Blonde&rsquo; played on the TV - she had these urge to talk about this, again.</p><p>However, today she was pretty determined. She was going to spill out those words out -one way or another.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; she called in a small voice. Nonetheless, Harry heard it as he hummed but his eyes still fixed on the TV screen. However, when he didn&rsquo;t hear Y/N ask about anything at all he looked down at her. And to his surprise, her cheeks were slightly pink, ears crimson red as she bites on her lips hard. And honestly, Harry was confused as to what made her this flustered.</p><p>He clearly saw her in this state every now and then. Once it was for a guy she really liked in her college. She was blabbering about how amazing he was to Harry with a huge grin on her face - lips between her teeth and cheeks flustered. And if Harry was honest there was a pang of jealousy in her chest as he told her &lsquo;he might be the one&rsquo;.</p><p>And the most recent one was when they were watching Fifty Shades Of Grey. Y/N hadn&rsquo;t watched it before and really wanted to see why people were so hyped about it. Especially because she hated the book, and didn&rsquo;t see why they&rsquo;d even make a film on it. However, that didn&rsquo;t stop her from getting flustered, during the sex scene. And, Harry swore he heard Y/N&rsquo;s breath hitched the moment Christian&nbsp;took an ice cube in his mouth and then swirled it around Anastasia&rsquo;s nipple. And Harry would be lying if he said he didn&rsquo;t want to just tie her up and just do the same.</p><p>But, seeing her then like that - he was pretty confused. They weren&rsquo;t watching anything like fifty shades of grey nor Y/N was gushing about a cute guy in her college. Or maybe she would then, and maybe that is why she called him so timidly and then went completely silent. And honestly, Harry hated the idea. He couldn&rsquo;t sit through another one hour of her talking about a guy she might be in love with. Last time he used every last bit of his will power to not just kiss her there and tell her he was utterly in love with her and no one could love her as he did. But clearly, his love was unrequited. So, he did what he thought was best and tried to push all his feeling away. But Harry swore if he had to sit through another one of her &lsquo;he&rsquo;s really amazing&rsquo; he was going to lose it.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Harry slowly brushed a strand of her hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I uh, I need some advice -tips,&rdquo; Y/N slowly sat up and looked down at her lap as she played with her fingers. She was nervous - Harry could tell.</p><p>&ldquo;On what, love?&rdquo; Harry tried to look at her eyes but her gaze was fixed on her lap.</p><p>&ldquo;I - I - can you tell-&rdquo; she finally looked up at him but she only got completely silent. As her skin got red as crimson.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what? Forget it,&rdquo; she diverted her eyes again and looked at the TV screen and unintentionally shifted away.</p><p>Harry knew her enough to know it wasn&rsquo;t about a boy. Even though he was relieved,&nbsp;he was concerned, what happened or made her so hesitant. And Harry feared that she might have gotten herself in some sort of trouble.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what happened? You can tell me anything you know?&rdquo; Harry scooped a little closure to her and put his hand on her knee in a comforting manner, but that only got Y/N more flustered. She could almost feel her skin burn under his touch as she could feel her panties go damp</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing really,&rdquo; she tried again. But this time she looked directly into his eyes and by the stern look he was giving her, she knew he wasn&rsquo;t letting it go until she spilled out the truth.</p><p>So, she let out a sigh in defeat. &ldquo;I was just wondering if you could give me some advice on -&rdquo; she looked up at him almost pleadingly but he only said 'shoot&rsquo;. So finding no other way she closed her eyes and said it. &ldquo;Adviceonhowtogivesomeoneablowjob.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Harry only looked at her eyebrows, as he tried to remember or even understand what his best friend just said.</p><p>Y/N sighed again looking down at her lap. &ldquo;I was wondering if you could give me some advice or tips on how to give someone a blowjob,&rdquo; she spoke much clearly and much slower this time so Harry could understand.</p><p>And he definitely did. His grip on Y/N knees got a little tighter -Y/N could feel the sweat of his palm; his eyes went wide and his breathing hitched.</p><p>Harry looked at her for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;I uh,&rdquo; Harry gulped just before letting out a cough. He didn&rsquo;t know either, why it was so awkward, hell they talked about more intimate stuff before, it wasn&rsquo;t any different -but for some reason it was.&ldquo;I um - what you need to know?&rdquo; he asked as he shifted a little nervously, abruptly taking his hand away from Y/N&rsquo;s knee.</p><p>&ldquo;Just how - you know how to do it well?&rdquo; Y/N fiddled with her fingers nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;Um - use your tongue, use your hands for the place you can&rsquo;t reach,&rdquo; Harry said somewhat awkwardly as he tried to avoid to look at Y/N completely.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; this time Y/N let out a groan and completely slumped down on the couch. &ldquo;What if I bite on him accidentally, and hurt him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Harry said finally looking at Y/N. &ldquo;Where is this coming from anyways?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember Josh-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That douchbag.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well before leaving he said, he&rsquo;d find someone who could actually give a blowjob-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You never told me that-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And even though he was a douchbag, he was kinda right. I can&rsquo;t give a blowjob.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s completely fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I guess, but you know I wanna do it,&rdquo; Y/N let out a sigh as she rested her head over the&nbsp;couch and looked up.</p><p>No one said anything for a while. Y/&nbsp; looked at the ceiling as she thought while Harry played with a paper-weight on the coffee table. The silence was all over pleasant, not an awkward or tensed one Harry thought it would be. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you teach me?&rdquo; Those words left before Y/N could even comprehend.</p><p>Both Y/N&rsquo;s and Harry&rsquo;s eyes went wide. </p><p>&ldquo;I- &rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Y/N quickly said but it was as if Harry didn&rsquo;t hear her.</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to teach you?&rdquo; Harry asked looking at her intently. But, it wasn&rsquo;t just any other stern look he ever gave, it was lustful.</p><p>Y/N swallowed hard. The look was enough to make her knee quiver and send chills down her spine to her heated core.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Forget that.&rdquo; </p><p>She quickly got up. But before she could walk away Harry grabbed her wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Harry slowly made Y/N stand between his legs as he got hold of both of her wrists. &ldquo;You want me to teach you?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N opened her mouth to tell him to forget it again but before she could reply Harry spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>It was the way he spoke, stern and strict; her name rolling out of his tongue as if he owned her.

I\u2019ve had a LOT going on here lately. There is more to come so stay tuned!!************</p><p><br/></p><p>Harry\nfelt like he was losing his mind. It seemed like something was always\ntrying to fight against him. He would find something good, that gave\nhis life joy, only to have it taken away. He was always left\nheartbroken, and he wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure as to why. He thought\nFelicity was different. He thought he had finally meet someone who\nwas worth his time. However, being him, he might have scared her\naway.</p><p>After\ntheir New Years kiss, he thought everything was fine. The two of them\nhad a few drinks, and Harry took her home. He had been surprised to\nfind out where she lived, and was extremely concerned. Her\nneighborhood was highly dangerous, and he feared for her safety. He,\nhowever, felt like he would be overstepping his boundaries if he\nplaced these concerns.</p><p>He\nkissed her goodnight at her doorstep and left without another word.\nHe had not stopped smiling since that night. He couldn&rsquo;t get her out\nof his mind, and he knew that he was in major trouble. After the way\nthings had ended with Courtney, he swore he would never give his\nheart away to anyone else.</p><p>With\nFelicity it had been different, he never stood a chance. She was just\nso nice, and it was like her heart was made of pure gold. Her laugh\nalone seemed to light up his world like never before. It was like he\nhad been walking in total darkness, even when he was with Courtney.</p><p>Courtney\nhad never made him feel that safe and secure. She was always more\nfocused on herself, wanting to be in the spot light. Harry was the\nperfect accessory for her. She knew that dating Harry Styles would\nfurther her career. Harry had been oblivious to this at the beginning\nof the relationship, but as the time went on he began to pick up on\nit. He thought that if he were to propose they would become closer.\nHe longed for a close and loving relationship with her.</p><p>He\nfelt hopeful, after meeting Felicity. She seemed to be the flicker of\na spark that lite the fire inside his soul. He felt like a blind man,\nwho was seeing the vast green fields filled with wild flowers for the\nvery first time. It was like he was walking in darkness all of his\nlife, until he walked into Hopes bar and heard a laugh he would never\nforget. Her laugh was contagious, and it made the entire room lite up\nwith joy.<br/><br/>Harry\nhad never been a believer in love at first sight. Sure he loved\nwatching romantic comedies\u2014and his favorite movie was the notebook\u2014\nbut, he knew that real life wasn\u2019t that simple. The movies\nportrayed a happily ever after, where the guy finally wins the girl\nof his dreams.<br/><br/>He\nlonged for a love like that. All he wanted in life was to have\nsomebody that he loved with all his heart, and to have them love him\njust as much in return. He didn\u2019t think that was too much to ask\nfor.<br/><br/>He\nwanted to go to the bar the day after New Years, with a big bouquet\nof roses. He was all smiles, and he was eager to ask Felicity out on\na proper date.<br/><br/>He\nknew that she worked the night shift so he waited until it was late\nto go in. The anticipation was killing him. He stared at the clock as\nit slowly ticked by. Just waiting for the perfect time to surprise\nher.<br/><br/>When\nhe finally felt like it was late enough, he got dressed up in a suit\nand tie. He wanted to look nice. He took one final look in the mirror\nand headed out. He had to stop himself from speeding down the\nhighway. The last thing he wanted was to get into a wreck and not be\nable to tell her how he felt.<br/><br/>He\nfinally pulled into the familiar parking lot and put his car into\npark. He had to take in a few deep breaths, before he could get out\nof the car. In all of his life, he had never felt nerves like this\nbefore. His hands were shaking, and he didn\u2019t know if it was from\nexcitement or fear of rejection. Sighing he shook his head. He knew\nhe was overreacting and worrying to much. He had to muster up the\ncourage and take a chance.<br/><br/>\u201cYou\ncan do this!\u201d He told himself, while staring into the mirror.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d<br/><br/>Without\nanother thought he climbed out of the car. He knew if he waited any\nlonger, he would talk himself out of asking her out. Locking his car,\nhe slowly made his way to the entrance. Before entering, he stood up\ntall and puffed out his chest a bit. He wanted to appear confident,\nrather than show off what a nervous wreck he was on the\ninside.<br/><br/>Walking\ninto the crowded bar, he scanned the room. His face fell\nautomatically, when he didn\u2019t see her right away. He did a double\ntake, just to make sure he didn\u2019t scan over her. When he came up\nshort once more, he looked every face over even slower.<br/><br/>Sighing,\nhe couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed. He walked up to the bar,\nwhen he noticed the girl behind it. He recognized her as Felicity\u2019s\nfriend. The girl that Felicity was always joking around with. He had\nalways found their encounters quite humorous. He believed her name\nwas Jenna, but he wasn\u2019t 100 percent certain of that.<br/><br/>Approaching\nher, he waved to get her attention. She gave him a bright smile and\ncame over right away. Harry smirked. He had always had this effect on\nwomen. He couldn\u2019t understand it himself, but he had always found\nit quite amusing.<br/><br/>\u201cWhat\ncan I do for you, handsome?\u201d She asked beaming.<br/><br/>Harry\nhad to fight the urge to roll his eyes. \u201cI was just wondering if\nyou knew where your friend Felicity was this evening? She\u2019s usually\nworking around this time of night.\u201d<br/><br/>Harry\ngave her a breathtaking smile, wanting to mess with her further. To\nhis greatest pleasure, she was momentarily speechless. He had to get\nher attention once more, as she stared into space. Harry sighed.\nAlthough amusing, he had always found this quite disappointing. Most\nwomen, now a days, couldn\u2019t seem to see passed his handsome face or\npiercing green eyes. To his frustration, they never seemed to want to\nget to know the real him. This is one of the millions of reasons he\nhad found Felicity so refreshing.<br/><br/>It\ntook her a moment to gather a coherent thought and answer Harry\u2019s\nquestion. \u201cFelicity?\u201d He asked again.<br/><br/>\u201cRight!\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure honey, she called in earlier. I guess\nsomething came up, she said she wouldn\u2019t be back in for a week or\nso.\u201d<br/><br/>Harry\ntried to mask his disappointment, trying to keep his composure.<br/><br/>\u201cI\nsee,\u201d he said lost in thought. \u201cDo you know where she went?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI\nbelieve, she went back home to visit her family. Some drama with her\nbrother, or something. She\u2019s rather closed off when it comes to\nthem. I couldn\u2019t even tell you where she\u2019s from.\u201d<br/><br/>Harry\nfelt his heart drop, as his excitement faded entirely. \u201cWell thank\nyou for your help!\u201d He told her, giving her one last smile. After\nthinking it over briefly, he handed her the roses. \u201cFor your\ntroubles. If you will just have her call me, when she gets\nback.\u201d<br/><br/>The\ngirl was all smiles, as she thanked him and excitedly took the\nflowers. He was glad some use had come from them.<br/><br/>He\nwalked out of the bar, without a second glance. Although he could\nreally use a drink, he decided he wanted to be alone tonight. If he\ncouldn\u2019t talk to Felicity, he didn\u2019t want to speak with\nanyone.<br/><br/>He\nstopped by the nearest liquor store, on the way back to his hotel\nroom. He picked up a fifth of whiskey and locked himself in his room\nto sulk the night away.</p>",

I\u2019ve had a LOT going on here lately. There is more to come so stay tuned!!************</p><p><br></p><p>Harry\nfelt like he was losing his mind. It seemed like something was always\ntrying to fight against him. He would find something good, that gave\nhis life joy, only to have it taken away. He was always left\nheartbroken, and he wasn\u2019t entirely sure as to why. He thought\nFelicity was different. He thought he had finally meet someone who\nwas worth his time. However, being him, he might have scared her\naway.</p><p>After\ntheir New Years kiss, he thought everything was fine. The two of them\nhad a few drinks, and Harry took her home. He had been surprised to\nfind out where she lived, and was extremely concerned. Her\nneighborhood was highly dangerous, and he feared for her safety. He,\nhowever, felt like he would be overstepping his boundaries if he\nplaced these concerns.</p><p>He\nkissed her goodnight at her doorstep and left without another word.\nHe had not stopped smiling since that night. He couldn\u2019t get her out\nof his mind, and he knew that he was in major trouble. After the way\nthings had ended with Courtney, he swore he would never give his\nheart away to anyone else.</p><p>With\nFelicity it had been different, he never stood a chance. She was just\nso nice, and it was like her heart was made of pure gold. Her laugh\nalone seemed to light up his world like never before. It was like he\nhad been walking in total darkness, even when he was with Courtney.</p><p>Courtney\nhad never made him feel that safe and secure. She was always more\nfocused on herself, wanting to be in the spot light. Harry was the\nperfect accessory for her. She knew that dating Harry Styles would\nfurther her career. Harry had been oblivious to this at the beginning\nof the relationship, but as the time went on he began to pick up on\nit. He thought that if he were to propose they would become closer.\nHe longed for a close and loving relationship with her.</p><p>He\nfelt hopeful, after meeting Felicity. She seemed to be the flicker of\na spark that lite the fire inside his soul. He felt like a blind man,\nwho was seeing the vast green fields filled with wild flowers for the\nvery first time. It was like he was walking in darkness all of his\nlife, until he walked into Hopes bar and heard a laugh he would never\nforget. Her laugh was contagious, and it made the entire room lite up\nwith joy.<br><br>Harry\nhad never been a believer in love at first sight. Sure he loved\nwatching romantic comedies\u2014and his favorite movie was the notebook\u2014\nbut, he knew that real life wasn\u2019t that simple. The movies\nportrayed a happily ever after, where the guy finally wins the girl\nof his dreams.<br><br>He\nlonged for a love like that. All he wanted in life was to have\nsomebody that he loved with all his heart, and to have them love him\njust as much in return. He didn\u2019t think that was too much to ask\nfor.<br><br>He\nwanted to go to the bar the day after New Years, with a big bouquet\nof roses. He was all smiles, and he was eager to ask Felicity out on\na proper date.<br><br>He\nknew that she worked the night shift so he waited until it was late\nto go in. The anticipation was killing him. He stared at the clock as\nit slowly ticked by. Just waiting for the perfect time to surprise\nher.<br><br>When\nhe finally felt like it was late enough, he got dressed up in a suit\nand tie. He wanted to look nice. He took one final look in the mirror\nand headed out. He had to stop himself from speeding down the\nhighway. The last thing he wanted was to get into a wreck and not be\nable to tell her how he felt.<br><br>He\nfinally pulled into the familiar parking lot and put his car into\npark. He had to take in a few deep breaths, before he could get out\nof the car. In all of his life, he had never felt nerves like this\nbefore. His hands were shaking, and he didn\u2019t know if it was from\nexcitement or fear of rejection. Sighing he shook his head. He knew\nhe was overreacting and worrying to much. He had to muster up the\ncourage and take a chance.<br><br>\u201cYou\ncan do this!\u201d He told himself, while staring into the mirror.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d<br><br>Without\nanother thought he climbed out of the car. He knew if he waited any\nlonger, he would talk himself out of asking her out. Locking his car,\nhe slowly made his way to the entrance. Before entering, he stood up\ntall and puffed out his chest a bit. He wanted to appear confident,\nrather than show off what a nervous wreck he was on the\ninside.<br><br>Walking\ninto the crowded bar, he scanned the room. His face fell\nautomatically, when he didn\u2019t see her right away. He did a double\ntake, just to make sure he didn\u2019t scan over her. When he came up\nshort once more, he looked every face over even slower.<br><br>Sighing,\nhe couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed. He walked up to the bar,\nwhen he noticed the girl behind it. He recognized her as Felicity\u2019s\nfriend. The girl that Felicity was always joking around with. He had\nalways found their encounters quite humorous. He believed her name\nwas Jenna, but he wasn\u2019t 100 percent certain of that.<br><br>Approaching\nher, he waved to get her attention. She gave him a bright smile and\ncame over right away. Harry smirked. He had always had this effect on\nwomen. He couldn\u2019t understand it himself, but he had always found\nit quite amusing.<br><br>\u201cWhat\ncan I do for you, handsome?\u201d She asked beaming.<br><br>Harry\nhad to fight the urge to roll his eyes. \u201cI was just wondering if\nyou knew where your friend Felicity was this evening? She\u2019s usually\nworking around this time of night.\u201d<br><br>Harry\ngave her a breathtaking smile, wanting to mess with her further. To\nhis greatest pleasure, she was momentarily speechless. He had to get\nher attention once more, as she stared into space. Harry sighed.\nAlthough amusing, he had always found this quite disappointing. Most\nwomen, now a days, couldn\u2019t seem to see passed his handsome face or\npiercing green eyes. To his frustration, they never seemed to want to\nget to know the real him. This is one of the millions of reasons he\nhad found Felicity so refreshing.<br><br>It\ntook her a moment to gather a coherent thought and answer Harry\u2019s\nquestion. \u201cFelicity?\u201d He asked again.<br><br>\u201cRight!\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure honey, she called in earlier. I guess\nsomething came up, she said she wouldn\u2019t be back in for a week or\nso.\u201d<br><br>Harry\ntried to mask his disappointment, trying to keep his composure.<br><br>\u201cI\nsee,\u201d he said lost in thought. \u201cDo you know where she went?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\nbelieve, she went back home to visit her family.
