                "content": "<p>So in regards to the discussion <a>@oadara</a>&#8203; <a href=\"http://oadara.tumblr.com/post/182637700486/cbrownjc-oadara-cbrownjc-oadara-i-was\">brought up here</a>, that this above picture is actually likely from EP 8x04 and not 8x01, I just noticed something that makes me more convinced that this picture IS from a later episode, and that is what is in the snow behind Jon and Dany:<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e91e55d1251f24bcc29ada77f102423a/tumblr_inline_pmkpcoKfLy1qi5869_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Notice what&rsquo;s in the highlighted sections? Body parts. Or, more specifically, body parts likely belong to soldiers from the Army of the Dead. <a href=\"https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/new-photos-season-8-daenerys-jon-snow\">If you check out the high-res version of the picture</a> you can notice it a bit better, even though the parts are cleverly hidden underneath the snow.</p><p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t think this picture is from 8x01, but a later episode. Most likely 8x04 since, again, David Nutter did film with Kit and Emilia by themselves in Iceland, and was the only one who did so. This could be them maybe going back to Winterfell after the battle to survey the damage/battlefield. Or maybe they are at some other place that had a battle happening with the Army of the Dead, and they are looking over the aftermath of that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></p>",

The post also criticizes Dany's supposed lack of interest in learning Elia and Rhaella's stories. I know something is flawed about this that I can't quite put into words, so maybe you could give your thoughts? (I'm really sorry if I sound presumptuous.)",
        "answer": "<p>There\u2019s a lot of things to discuss in your ask. First, the question of\nElia and Rhaella. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBlzqoBRtXmp7uMjEINDJxA\">@nobodysuspectsthebutterfly</a> made two posts about this, and you\ncan read them <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/182400421293/unpopular-opinion-but-dany-would-do-so-much-better\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/182406564063/cleverjonquil-reblogged-the-post-cleverjonquil\">here</a>.</p><p>Saying that Dany has no interest of learning about\nElia and Rhaella is very unfair. Most of what we know about Elia and Rhaella\ncome from Oberyn, from Jaime, from the World of Ice and Fire book, and because\nDany asks questions about them. Dany is interested in learning about them. This\nis Dany asking about her mother:</p><blockquote><p>Ser\nBarristan went on. <b>\u201cI saw your father and your mother wed as well.</b> Forgive me, but there was no fondness there, and the realm paid\ndearly for that, my queen.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cWhy did they wed if they did\nnot love each other?\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cYour grandsire commanded it. A woods witch had told him that the\nprince was promised would be born of their line.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys IV\nADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cTell me,\u201d Dany said, as\nthe procession turned toward the Temple of the Graces, \u201cif my\nfather and my mother had been free to follow their own hearts, whom would they\nhave wed?\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cIt was long ago. Your Grace would not know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, though. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>The\nold knight inclined his head. \u201cThe queen your mother was\nalways mindful of her duty.\u201d He was handsome in his gold-and-silver\narmor, his white cloak streaming from his shoulders, but he sounded like a man\nin pain, as if every word were a stone he had to pass. \u201cAs a\ngirl, though \u2026 she was once smitten with a young knight from the stormlands who\nwore her favor at a tourney and named her queen of love and beauty. A brief\nthing.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cWhat happened to this knight?\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cHe put away his lance the day your lady mother wed your father.\nAfterward he became most pious, and was heard to say that only the Maiden could\nreplace Queen Rhaella in his heart. His passion was impossible, of course. A\nlanded knight is no fit consort for a princess of royal blood.\u201d \u2013\nDaenerys VII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany also\nthinks a lot about Elia and her children, and asks questions about them:</p><blockquote><p>Yet sometimes Dany\nwould picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the\nstories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship\u2019s\nblack sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of\nthe Trident and dying for the woman he loved. <b>The sack of King\u2019s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper\u2019s\ndogs, the lords Lannister and Stark.

What is\nthe song of ice and fire?\u201d \u2013 Daenerys V ACOK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cBut that was\nthe tourney when he crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty!\u201d\nsaid Dany.<b> \u201cPrincess Elia was there, his wife, and\nyet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl, and later stole her away from\nher betrothed.

The Princess Elia was a\ngood and gracious lady, though her health was ever delicate.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys\nIV ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cYou\nsaw my brother Rhaegar wed. Tell me, did he wed for love or duty?\u201d</b></p><p>The old knight hesitated. \u201cPrincess Elia\nwas a good woman, Your Grace. She was kind and clever, with a gentle heart and\na sweet wit. I know the prince was very fond of her.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>As you can see, Dany is interested, and\nshe constantly thinks about the injustice made against Elia and her children.\nBesides, if we know little about these women, this isn\u2019t Dany\u2019s fault. It\u2019s\nGRRM\u2019s fault for not being interested in writing about them. This is a problem\nin GRRM\u2019s writing. I\u2019m tired of seeing Dany being blamed for the problems in\nthe narrative. These problems aren\u2019t her fault. I\u2019ve also seen people in the\nfandom criticize Dany for this line:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBut that was\nthe tourney when he crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty!\u201d\nsaid Dany.<b> \u201cPrincess Elia was there, his wife, and\nyet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl, and later stole her away from\nher betrothed. How could he do that? Did the Dornish woman treat him so ill?\u201d</b></p></blockquote><p>Antis say that Dany is \u201cvictim blaming\u201d\nElia. But I also think this criticism is very unfair. Because everything that\nDany knows about Rhaegar from other people has been positive. She has been told\nall of these stories about how Rhaegar was honorable, just and good. With all\nof that, she can\u2019t imagine why would Rhaegar publicly humiliate his wife. She\neven asks \u201chow could he do that?\u201d She\u2019s appalled by the idea that Rhaegar would\ndo something like that, so she asks for an explanation. Then, she tells Ser\nBarristan about what Viserys would tell her, how he used to be an emotionally\nabusive asshole that blamed both her and Elia for Rhaegar not being happy:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is not for such as me to say what\nmight have been in your brother\u2019s heart, Your Grace. The Princess Elia was a\ngood and gracious lady, though her health was ever delicate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dany pulled the\nlion pelt tighter about her shoulders. <b>\u201cViserys\nsaid once that it was my fault, for being born too late.\u201d She had denied\nit hotly, she remembered, going so far as to tell Viserys that it was his fault\nfor not being born a girl. He beat her cruelly for that insolence.</b> \u201cIf\nI had been born more timely, he said, Rhaegar would have married me instead of\nElia, and it would all have come out different. If Rhaegar had been happy in\nhis wife, he would not have needed the Stark girl.\u201d \u2013 Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m sorry, but Dany doesn\u2019t know the full\nstory, and even worse, she had Viserys telling her all these incorrect things.\nViserys even emotionally and physically abused her for questioning his version\nof the facts. I\u2019m tired of seeing this fandom blame Dany for things that she\ndoesn\u2019t know, as if she\u2019s somehow obligated to be omniscient and know all the\nbad stuff about Rhaegar and her father. Dany doesn\u2019t know that. For all she\nknew, Rhaegar was a very good person, so it\u2019s natural that she would ask for an\nexplanation about what happened. But notice that when Ser Barristan tells her\nthe truth, Dany never tries to contradict him. She never tells him \u201cno, you\u2019re\nlying, Elia must have done something bad, she must be blamed\u201d. Dany DOES NOT\nblame Elia. She was simply asking a question, because she doesn\u2019t know anything\nabout what happened.</p><p>Finally, let\u2019s talk about this idea that\nDany believes in \u201ca power that destroys and oppresses\u201d. I think there are\ndifferent levels of wrong with this.</p><p>First: antis seem to have this idea that\nthe only way Dany knows how to keep power is through war and force (hard\npower). This is wrong. Dany\u2019s entire storyline in ADWD is about making\ncompromises to keep peace, using soft power, and rebuilding (the only thing Dany is \u201cdestroying\u201d is the slave trade). Dany dislikes violence. She\u2019s\nactually a very flexible ruler that tries everything she can to accommodate the\nneeds of different people: she adapts to other cultures, she makes several\nconcessions in Meereen, she tries everything she can to find peaceful\nsolutions. The idea that Dany only maintains power through violence and destruction and that\nshe \u201cdoesn\u2019t question it\u201d is ridiculously wrong:</p><blockquote><p><b>What good is peace if it must be purchased with the\u00a0blood\u00a0of little\u00a0children?</b> \u201cThese murders are not their doing,\u201d Dany\ntold the Green Grace, feebly. <b>\u201cI am\nno butcher queen.\u201d</b><b> </b>\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cZhak and Pahl and Merreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great\nMasters. Who else would it be?\u201d</p><p><b>He is as\nbold as he is bloody. \u201cWe have no proof this is their work. </b><b>Would you have me slaughter my own\u00a0subjects?\u201d</b></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p>\u201cThen winkle them out of their pyramids on some pretext. A wedding\nmight serve. Why not? Promise your hand to Hizdahr and all the Great Masters\nwill come to see you married. When they gather in the Temple of the Graces,\nturn us loose upon them.\u201d</p><p><b>Dany was\nappalled. He is a monster. A gallant monster, but a monster still. \u201cDo you\ntake me for the\u00a0Butcher\u00a0King?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cBetter\nthe butcher than the meat. All kings are butchers. Are queens so\ndifferent?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cThis queen is.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Only at the end of ADWD does Dany reject\nthe peace, and the reason for that is that the peace was unjust. Dany had to\naccept things like seeing people dying in the fighting pits and allowing\nslavery to return outside Meereen. A peace with slavery means that people will\nsuffer continuous violence (slaves are beaten, raped, mutilated, overworked,\ntreated like things). A peace with slavery is no true peace. I think Dany is\nright in being unsatisfied with a peace like that.</p><p>Second: this idea that any ruler could\neschew military power is ridiculous. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvhsboNP9qOVc_xNuvUBhqw\">@instantbouquetface-me</a> wrote a great post\nabout this. You can read it <a href=\"https://instantbouquetface-me.tumblr.com/post/175316323153/i-see-that-you-are-a-major-targaryen-stan-well-i\">here</a>. But basically, as Max Weber says, any state \u201cclaims\nthe monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory\u201d.\nMilitary power is part of that. Unless antis want Dany to help Westeros or\nMeereen to become an anarchy (I highly doubt that), then she needs military\npower as well. That\u2019s how everyone (Starks, Targaryens, Lannisters, everyone)\ngains and keeps power. The Starks didn\u2019t become Kings in the\nNorth by asking politely and making friends. They became Kings in the North\nthrough conquest.</p><p>Even rulers that are considered to be\nconciliators, like Jaehaerys and Alysanne, kept their power through threat of\nviolence. Actually, no one would need to make compromises if military power\nwasn\u2019t important. The reason Dany has to make compromises in Meereen is because\nshe doesn\u2019t have enough military power to defeat her enemies (and her dragons\nare chained), and because her enemies have military and economic power that\nthey can use against her. The reason people make alliances is this one as well:\nif you make an alliance with someone, then you have access to their economic\nand military power.</p><p>Even people that obtain power through more\n\u201cfeminine\u201d means are also obtaining military power. Let\u2019s take Sansa as an\nexample. She\u2019s currently in the Vale, trying to marry Harry to assume power in\nthe Vale and take back Winterfell. You could say that her ways of obtaining\npower are more \u201ctraditionally feminine\u201d. But ultimately, what it actually means\nis that if she marries Harry and Robert Arryn dies, she\u2019ll have access to the\npower and armies of the Vale. And she\u2019ll use this military power to forcefully\ntake Winterfell back. Even if she makes alliances with the Northern houses, these\nalliances are important because of the military power that comes with them.</p><p>Besides, if Dany wants to defeat the\nslavers or become queen of Westeros, she needs to do it by force. I\u2019m repeating\nmyself here, but I don\u2019t care: Westeros is not a democracy. Dany can\u2019t sign up\nfor the next Westerosi presidential elections, there\u2019s no way for her to take\npower that doesn\u2019t involve force. Dany herself tell us this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYet I must have some army,\u201d Dany said.\u00a0<b>\u201cThe boy\u00a0Joffrey\u00a0will not give me the Iron Throne for\nasking politely.\u201d</b>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s right. No one will give her the\nIron Throne by asking politely, just like the Boltons won\u2019t give Winterfell\nback to the Starks by asking politely. They are not going to hold elections to\ndecide if the rulers of the North should be the Boltons or the Starks. The\nStarks, just like Dany, will have to use force.</p><p>With all of this being said, I do think\nthat Dany has some internalized sexism, like the time in which she says that\nshe believes that it\u2019s her son that will rule Westeros, and not her. But every\ncharacter in this story is sexist in some way, because this is a patriarchal\nsociety. And I don\u2019t think that the arguments of the antis hold much water.\nDany does ask about Elia and Elia, and the use of military power is a necessity\nfor any ruler. Having military power doesn\u2019t make Dany \u201ctoxically masculine\u201d.\nAntis keep saying things like \u201cif only Dany was kind and gentle and embraced \u2018feminine\nqualities\u2019 she would be such a better ruler\u201d. But this is wrong. First, because\nDany is kind and gentle. Second, because being kind and gentle doesn\u2019t mean you\nwill be a good ruler. Power will not fall into your lap if you just \u201cembrace\nyour femininity\u201d. Being a ruling queen means that Dany has to deal with the\nkind of power that is usually seen as masculine, like commanding armies,\ndealing with justice, and using force. Ruling is something seen as masculine.\nWhat I actually think is sexist is this idea that a woman must always conform\nto gender roles and be \u201cfeminine\u201d. What\u2019s sexist is this idea that if a woman assumes a\nmasculine-coded position like being a ruling queen, then she\u2019s \u201ctoxically\nmasculine\u201d and evil. This whole discourse around Dany just goes to prove how\nmuch people are uncomfortable with women in positions of power.</p>",

I think there are\ndifferent levels of wrong with this.</p><p>First: antis seem to have this idea that\nthe only way Dany knows how to keep power is through war and force (hard\npower). This is wrong. Dany\u2019s entire storyline in ADWD is about making\ncompromises to keep peace, using soft power, and rebuilding (the only thing Dany is \u201cdestroying\u201d is the slave trade). Dany dislikes violence. She\u2019s\nactually a very flexible ruler that tries everything she can to accommodate the\nneeds of different people: she adapts to other cultures, she makes several\nconcessions in Meereen, she tries everything she can to find peaceful\nsolutions. The idea that Dany only maintains power through violence and destruction and that\nshe \u201cdoesn\u2019t question it\u201d is ridiculously wrong:</p><blockquote><p><b>What good is peace if it must be purchased with the\u00a0blood\u00a0of little\u00a0children?</b> \u201cThese murders are not their doing,\u201d Dany\ntold the Green Grace, feebly. <b>\u201cI am\nno butcher queen.\u201d</b><b> </b>\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cZhak and Pahl and Merreq.

Are queens so\ndifferent?\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cThis queen is.\u201d </b>\u2013 Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Only at the end of ADWD does Dany reject\nthe peace, and the reason for that is that the peace was unjust. Dany had to\naccept things like seeing people dying in the fighting pits and allowing\nslavery to return outside Meereen. A peace with slavery means that people will\nsuffer continuous violence (slaves are beaten, raped, mutilated, overworked,\ntreated like things). A peace with slavery is no true peace. I think Dany is\nright in being unsatisfied with a peace like that.</p><p>Second: this idea that any ruler could\neschew military power is ridiculous. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvhsboNP9qOVc_xNuvUBhqw\">@instantbouquetface-me</a> wrote a great post\nabout this. You can read it <a href=\"https://instantbouquetface-me.tumblr.com/post/175316323153/i-see-that-you-are-a-major-targaryen-stan-well-i\">here</a>. But basically, as Max Weber says, any state \u201cclaims\nthe monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory\u201d.\nMilitary power is part of that. Unless antis want Dany to help Westeros or\nMeereen to become an anarchy (I highly doubt that), then she needs military\npower as well. That\u2019s how everyone (Starks, Targaryens, Lannisters, everyone)\ngains and keeps power. The Starks didn\u2019t become Kings in the\nNorth by asking politely and making friends. They became Kings in the North\nthrough conquest.</p><p>Even rulers that are considered to be\nconciliators, like Jaehaerys and Alysanne, kept their power through threat of\nviolence. Actually, no one would need to make compromises if military power\nwasn\u2019t important. The reason Dany has to make compromises in Meereen is because\nshe doesn\u2019t have enough military power to defeat her enemies (and her dragons\nare chained), and because her enemies have military and economic power that\nthey can use against her. The reason people make alliances is this one as well:\nif you make an alliance with someone, then you have access to their economic\nand military power.</p><p>Even people that obtain power through more\n\u201cfeminine\u201d means are also obtaining military power. Let\u2019s take Sansa as an\nexample. She\u2019s currently in the Vale, trying to marry Harry to assume power in\nthe Vale and take back Winterfell. You could say that her ways of obtaining\npower are more \u201ctraditionally feminine\u201d. But ultimately, what it actually means\nis that if she marries Harry and Robert Arryn dies, she\u2019ll have access to the\npower and armies of the Vale. And she\u2019ll use this military power to forcefully\ntake Winterfell back. Even if she makes alliances with the Northern houses, these\nalliances are important because of the military power that comes with them.</p><p>Besides, if Dany wants to defeat the\nslavers or become queen of Westeros, she needs to do it by force. I\u2019m repeating\nmyself here, but I don\u2019t care: Westeros is not a democracy. Dany can\u2019t sign up\nfor the next Westerosi presidential elections, there\u2019s no way for her to take\npower that doesn\u2019t involve force. Dany herself tell us this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYet I must have some army,\u201d Dany said.\u00a0<b>\u201cThe boy\u00a0Joffrey\u00a0will not give me the Iron Throne for\nasking politely.\u201d</b>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s right. No one will give her the\nIron Throne by asking politely, just like the Boltons won\u2019t give Winterfell\nback to the Starks by asking politely. They are not going to hold elections to\ndecide if the rulers of the North should be the Boltons or the Starks. The\nStarks, just like Dany, will have to use force.</p><p>With all of this being said, I do think\nthat Dany has some internalized sexism, like the time in which she says that\nshe believes that it\u2019s her son that will rule Westeros, and not her. But every\ncharacter in this story is sexist in some way, because this is a patriarchal\nsociety. And I don\u2019t think that the arguments of the antis hold much water.\nDany does ask about Elia and Elia, and the use of military power is a necessity\nfor any ruler. Having military power doesn\u2019t make Dany \u201ctoxically masculine\u201d.\nAntis keep saying things like \u201cif only Dany was kind and gentle and embraced \u2018feminine\nqualities\u2019 she would be such a better ruler\u201d. But this is wrong. First, because\nDany is kind and gentle. Second, because being kind and gentle doesn\u2019t mean you\nwill be a good ruler. Power will not fall into your lap if you just \u201cembrace\nyour femininity\u201d. Being a ruling queen means that Dany has to deal with the\nkind of power that is usually seen as masculine, like commanding armies,\ndealing with justice, and using force. Ruling is something seen as masculine.\nWhat I actually think is sexist is this idea that a woman must always conform\nto gender roles and be \u201cfeminine\u201d. What\u2019s sexist is this idea that if a woman assumes a\nmasculine-coded position like being a ruling queen, then she\u2019s \u201ctoxically\nmasculine\u201d and evil. This whole discourse around Dany just goes to prove how\nmuch people are uncomfortable with women in positions of power.</p>",

Most of what we know about Elia and Rhaella\ncome from Oberyn, from Jaime, from the World of Ice and Fire book, and because\nDany asks questions about them. Dany is interested in learning about them. This\nis Dany asking about her mother:</p><blockquote><p>Ser\nBarristan went on. <b>\u201cI saw your father and your mother wed as well.</b> Forgive me, but there was no fondness there, and the realm paid\ndearly for that, my queen.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cWhy did they wed if they did\nnot love each other?\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cYour grandsire commanded it. A woods witch had told him that the\nprince was promised would be born of their line.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys IV\nADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>\u201cTell me,\u201d Dany said, as\nthe procession turned toward the Temple of the Graces, \u201cif my\nfather and my mother had been free to follow their own hearts, whom would they\nhave wed?\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cIt was long ago. Your Grace would not know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, though. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>The\nold knight inclined his head. \u201cThe queen your mother was\nalways mindful of her duty.\u201d He was handsome in his gold-and-silver\narmor, his white cloak streaming from his shoulders, but he sounded like a man\nin pain, as if every word were a stone he had to pass. \u201cAs a\ngirl, though \u2026 she was once smitten with a young knight from the stormlands who\nwore her favor at a tourney and named her queen of love and beauty. A brief\nthing.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cWhat happened to this knight?\u201d</b></p><p>\u201cHe put away his lance the day your lady mother wed your father.\nAfterward he became most pious, and was heard to say that only the Maiden could\nreplace Queen Rhaella in his heart. His passion was impossible, of course. A\nlanded knight is no fit consort for a princess of royal blood.\u201d \u2013\nDaenerys VII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany also\nthinks a lot about Elia and her children, and asks questions about them:</p><blockquote><p>Yet sometimes Dany\nwould picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the\nstories.

That\u2019s how everyone (Starks, Targaryens, Lannisters, everyone)\ngains and keeps power. The Starks didn\u2019t become Kings in the\nNorth by asking politely and making friends. They became Kings in the North\nthrough conquest.</p><p>Even rulers that are considered to be\nconciliators, like Jaehaerys and Alysanne, kept their power through threat of\nviolence. Actually, no one would need to make compromises if military power\nwasn\u2019t important. The reason Dany has to make compromises in Meereen is because\nshe doesn\u2019t have enough military power to defeat her enemies (and her dragons\nare chained), and because her enemies have military and economic power that\nthey can use against her. The reason people make alliances is this one as well:\nif you make an alliance with someone, then you have access to their economic\nand military power.</p><p>Even people that obtain power through more\n\u201cfeminine\u201d means are also obtaining military power. Let\u2019s take Sansa as an\nexample. She\u2019s currently in the Vale, trying to marry Harry to assume power in\nthe Vale and take back Winterfell. You could say that her ways of obtaining\npower are more \u201ctraditionally feminine\u201d. But ultimately, what it actually means\nis that if she marries Harry and Robert Arryn dies, she\u2019ll have access to the\npower and armies of the Vale. And she\u2019ll use this military power to forcefully\ntake Winterfell back. Even if she makes alliances with the Northern houses, these\nalliances are important because of the military power that comes with them.</p><p>Besides, if Dany wants to defeat the\nslavers or become queen of Westeros, she needs to do it by force. I\u2019m repeating\nmyself here, but I don\u2019t care: Westeros is not a democracy. Dany can\u2019t sign up\nfor the next Westerosi presidential elections, there\u2019s no way for her to take\npower that doesn\u2019t involve force. Dany herself tell us this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYet I must have some army,\u201d Dany said.\u00a0<b>\u201cThe boy\u00a0Joffrey\u00a0will not give me the Iron Throne for\nasking politely.\u201d</b>\u00a0\u2013 Daenerys II ASOS</p></blockquote><p>She\u2019s right. No one will give her the\nIron Throne by asking politely, just like the Boltons won\u2019t give Winterfell\nback to the Starks by asking politely. They are not going to hold elections to\ndecide if the rulers of the North should be the Boltons or the Starks. The\nStarks, just like Dany, will have to use force.</p><p>With all of this being said, I do think\nthat Dany has some internalized sexism, like the time in which she says that\nshe believes that it\u2019s her son that will rule Westeros, and not her. But every\ncharacter in this story is sexist in some way, because this is a patriarchal\nsociety. And I don\u2019t think that the arguments of the antis hold much water.\nDany does ask about Elia and Elia, and the use of military power is a necessity\nfor any ruler. Having military power doesn\u2019t make Dany \u201ctoxically masculine\u201d.\nAntis keep saying things like \u201cif only Dany was kind and gentle and embraced \u2018feminine\nqualities\u2019 she would be such a better ruler\u201d. But this is wrong. First, because\nDany is kind and gentle. Second, because being kind and gentle doesn\u2019t mean you\nwill be a good ruler. Power will not fall into your lap if you just \u201cembrace\nyour femininity\u201d. Being a ruling queen means that Dany has to deal with the\nkind of power that is usually seen as masculine, like commanding armies,\ndealing with justice, and using force. Ruling is something seen as masculine.\nWhat I actually think is sexist is this idea that a woman must always conform\nto gender roles and be \u201cfeminine\u201d. What\u2019s sexist is this idea that if a woman assumes a\nmasculine-coded position like being a ruling queen, then she\u2019s \u201ctoxically\nmasculine\u201d and evil. This whole discourse around Dany just goes to prove how\nmuch people are uncomfortable with women in positions of power.</p>",
                "content": "<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things to discuss in your ask. First, the question of\nElia and Rhaella. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBlzqoBRtXmp7uMjEINDJxA\">@nobodysuspectsthebutterfly</a> made two posts about this, and you\ncan read them <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/182400421293/unpopular-opinion-but-dany-would-do-so-much-better\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/182406564063/cleverjonquil-reblogged-the-post-cleverjonquil\">here</a>.</p><p>Saying that Dany has no interest of learning about\nElia and Rhaella is very unfair. Most of what we know about Elia and Rhaella\ncome from Oberyn, from Jaime, from the World of Ice and Fire book, and because\nDany asks questions about them. Dany is interested in learning about them. This\nis Dany asking about her mother:</p><blockquote><p>Ser\nBarristan went on. <b>&ldquo;I saw your father and your mother wed as well.</b> Forgive me, but there was no fondness there, and the realm paid\ndearly for that, my queen.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;Why did they wed if they did\nnot love each other?&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;Your grandsire commanded it. A woods witch had told him that the\nprince was promised would be born of their line.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; Daenerys IV\nADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Dany said, as\nthe procession turned toward the Temple of the Graces, &ldquo;if my\nfather and my mother had been free to follow their own hearts, whom would they\nhave wed?&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;It was long ago. Your Grace would not know them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, though. Tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nold knight inclined his head. &ldquo;The queen your mother was\nalways mindful of her duty.&rdquo; He was handsome in his gold-and-silver\narmor, his white cloak streaming from his shoulders, but he sounded like a man\nin pain, as if every word were a stone he had to pass. &ldquo;As a\ngirl, though &hellip; she was once smitten with a young knight from the stormlands who\nwore her favor at a tourney and named her queen of love and beauty. A brief\nthing.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;What happened to this knight?&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;He put away his lance the day your lady mother wed your father.\nAfterward he became most pious, and was heard to say that only the Maiden could\nreplace Queen Rhaella in his heart. His passion was impossible, of course. A\nlanded knight is no fit consort for a princess of royal blood.&rdquo; &ndash;\nDaenerys VII ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Dany also\nthinks a lot about Elia and her children, and asks questions about them:</p><blockquote><p>Yet sometimes Dany\nwould picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the\nstories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship&rsquo;s\nblack sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of\nthe Trident and dying for the woman he loved. <b>The sack of King&rsquo;s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper&rsquo;s\ndogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess&nbsp;Elia</b><b>&nbsp;of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar&rsquo;s heir was\nripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes.</b> The polished skulls of\nthe last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room\nwhile the Kingslayer opened Father&rsquo;s throat with a golden sword. &ndash;\nDaenerys I AGOT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She nodded. &ldquo;There was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast.\nMy brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name\nhim Aegon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prince Aegon was Rhaegar&rsquo;s heir by&nbsp;Elia&nbsp;of Dorne,&rdquo; Ser Jorah said. &ldquo;But if he was this\nprince that was promised, the promise was broken along with his skull when the\nLannisters dashed his head against a wall.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;I\nremember,&rdquo; Dany said sadly. &ldquo;They murdered Rhaegar&rsquo;s daughter as\nwell, the little princess. Rhaenys, she was named, like Aegon&rsquo;s sister.</b> There was no Visenya, but he said the dragon has three heads. What is\nthe song of ice and fire?&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys V ACOK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;But that was\nthe tourney when he crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty!&rdquo;\nsaid Dany.<b> &ldquo;Princess Elia was there, his wife, and\nyet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl, and later stole her away from\nher betrothed. How could he do that? Did the Dornish woman treat him so ill?&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;It is not for such as me to say what\nmight have been in your brother&rsquo;s heart, Your Grace. The Princess Elia was a\ngood and gracious lady, though her health was ever delicate.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; Daenerys\nIV ASOS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;You\nsaw my brother Rhaegar wed. Tell me, did he wed for love or duty?&rdquo;</b></p><p>The old knight hesitated. &ldquo;Princess Elia\nwas a good woman, Your Grace. She was kind and clever, with a gentle heart and\na sweet wit. I know the prince was very fond of her.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>As you can see, Dany is interested, and\nshe constantly thinks about the injustice made against Elia and her children.\nBesides, if we know little about these women, this isn&rsquo;t Dany&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s\nGRRM&rsquo;s fault for not being interested in writing about them. This is a problem\nin GRRM&rsquo;s writing. I&rsquo;m tired of seeing Dany being blamed for the problems in\nthe narrative. These problems aren&rsquo;t her fault. I&rsquo;ve also seen people in the\nfandom criticize Dany for this line:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;But that was\nthe tourney when he crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty!&rdquo;\nsaid Dany.<b> &ldquo;Princess Elia was there, his wife, and\nyet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl, and later stole her away from\nher betrothed. How could he do that? Did the Dornish woman treat him so ill?&rdquo;</b></p></blockquote><p>Antis say that Dany is &ldquo;victim blaming&rdquo;\nElia. But I also think this criticism is very unfair. Because everything that\nDany knows about Rhaegar from other people has been positive. She has been told\nall of these stories about how Rhaegar was honorable, just and good. With all\nof that, she can&rsquo;t imagine why would Rhaegar publicly humiliate his wife. She\neven asks &ldquo;how could he do that?&rdquo; She&rsquo;s appalled by the idea that Rhaegar would\ndo something like that, so she asks for an explanation. Then, she tells Ser\nBarristan about what Viserys would tell her, how he used to be an emotionally\nabusive asshole that blamed both her and Elia for Rhaegar not being happy:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is not for such as me to say what\nmight have been in your brother&rsquo;s heart, Your Grace. The Princess Elia was a\ngood and gracious lady, though her health was ever delicate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dany pulled the\nlion pelt tighter about her shoulders. <b>&ldquo;Viserys\nsaid once that it was my fault, for being born too late.&rdquo; She had denied\nit hotly, she remembered, going so far as to tell Viserys that it was his fault\nfor not being born a girl. He beat her cruelly for that insolence.</b> &ldquo;If\nI had been born more timely, he said, Rhaegar would have married me instead of\nElia, and it would all have come out different. If Rhaegar had been happy in\nhis wife, he would not have needed the Stark girl.&rdquo; &ndash; Daenerys IV ASOS</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but Dany doesn&rsquo;t know the full\nstory, and even worse, she had Viserys telling her all these incorrect things.\nViserys even emotionally and physically abused her for questioning his version\nof the facts. I&rsquo;m tired of seeing this fandom blame Dany for things that she\ndoesn&rsquo;t know, as if she&rsquo;s somehow obligated to be omniscient and know all the\nbad stuff about Rhaegar and her father. Dany doesn&rsquo;t know that. For all she\nknew, Rhaegar was a very good person, so it&rsquo;s natural that she would ask for an\nexplanation about what happened. But notice that when Ser Barristan tells her\nthe truth, Dany never tries to contradict him. She never tells him &ldquo;no, you&rsquo;re\nlying, Elia must have done something bad, she must be blamed&rdquo;. Dany DOES NOT\nblame Elia. She was simply asking a question, because she doesn&rsquo;t know anything\nabout what happened.</p><p>Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about this idea that\nDany believes in &ldquo;a power that destroys and oppresses&rdquo;. I think there are\ndifferent levels of wrong with this.</p><p>First: antis seem to have this idea that\nthe only way Dany knows how to keep power is through war and force (hard\npower). This is wrong. Dany&rsquo;s entire storyline in ADWD is about making\ncompromises to keep peace, using soft power, and rebuilding (the only thing Dany is &ldquo;destroying&rdquo; is the slave trade). Dany dislikes violence. She&rsquo;s\nactually a very flexible ruler that tries everything she can to accommodate the\nneeds of different people: she adapts to other cultures, she makes several\nconcessions in Meereen, she tries everything she can to find peaceful\nsolutions. The idea that Dany only maintains power through violence and destruction and that\nshe &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t question it&rdquo; is ridiculously wrong:</p><blockquote><p><b>What good is peace if it must be purchased with the&nbsp;blood&nbsp;of little&nbsp;children?</b> &ldquo;These murders are not their doing,&rdquo; Dany\ntold the Green Grace, feebly. <b>&ldquo;I am\nno butcher queen.&rdquo;</b><b> </b>&ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Zhak and Pahl and Merreq. Them, and all the rest. The Great\nMasters. Who else would it be?&rdquo;</p><p><b>He is as\nbold as he is bloody. &ldquo;We have no proof this is their work. </b><b>Would you have me slaughter my own&nbsp;subjects?&rdquo;</b></p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p>&ldquo;Then winkle them out of their pyramids on some pretext. A wedding\nmight serve. Why not? Promise your hand to Hizdahr and all the Great Masters\nwill come to see you married. When they gather in the Temple of the Graces,\nturn us loose upon them.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Dany was\nappalled. He is a monster. A gallant monster, but a monster still. &ldquo;Do you\ntake me for the&nbsp;Butcher&nbsp;King?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Better\nthe butcher than the meat. All kings are butchers. Are queens so\ndifferent?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;This queen is.&rdquo; </b>&ndash; Daenerys IV ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Only at the end of ADWD does Dany reject\nthe peace, and the reason for that is that the peace was unjust. Dany had to\naccept things like seeing people dying in the fighting pits and allowing\nslavery to return outside Meereen. A peace with slavery means that people will\nsuffer continuous violence (slaves are beaten, raped, mutilated, overworked,\ntreated like things). A peace with slavery is no true peace. I think Dany is\nright in being unsatisfied with a peace like that.</p><p>Second: this idea that any ruler could\neschew military power is ridiculous. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvhsboNP9qOVc_xNuvUBhqw\">@instantbouquetface-me</a> wrote a great post\nabout this. You can read it <a href=\"https://instantbouquetface-me.tumblr.com/post/175316323153/i-see-that-you-are-a-major-targaryen-stan-well-i\">here</a>. But basically, as Max Weber says, any state &ldquo;claims\nthe monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory&rdquo;.\nMilitary power is part of that.
