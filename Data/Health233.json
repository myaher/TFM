Like you pay weekly but can talk to the therapist via text, phone call, email and video chat any time you need. Like you know how therapy is a set day and aren\u2019t really there if you\u2019re in the midst of a panic attack etc? Like you can go see them on Monday and on Wednesday have a panic attack and need someone to talk to but you have to wait for your session again on Monday. With better help you can talk to your therapist on Monday and if you need them again in Wednesday you can talk to them on that day too and I believe its a paid weekly thing and not per session.\u00a0</p>",
