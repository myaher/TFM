Also, can you imagine Watson doing all the stuff Rhodey did. It&rsquo;d be awesome.</p><p>Sam Wilson-John Roxton: Sometime I&rsquo;ll have to make a post on how I prefer Doyle&rsquo;s Challenger stories to Sherlock Holmes. Roxton is a morally upright adventurer, the kind of old chivalric soul who would join up with resurrected Arthur Pendragon and&hellip;.well, I don&rsquo;t want to spoil Endgame for anyone but if you&rsquo;ve seen it you know where I&rsquo;m going with this.</p><p>Scarlet Witch-Gerda (The Snow Queen): I know she doesn&rsquo;t have any powers but I think this younger adventurer trying to save a sibling figure is a good analog for Wanda</p><p>Quicksilver-Kai (The Snow Queen): almost entirely based upon his relationship with Gerda&hellip;.and his general bitterness&hellip;.and his expendability.</p><p>Vision-Olympia the Doll Woman: Based on the idea of Frankenstein&rsquo;s Monster as Ultron, Olympia would be the more perfect second draft, mixed with the consciousness of Mrs. Hudson (as JARVIS).</p><p>Doctor Strange-Doctor Silence: Victorian surgeon/mystic with a cool last name. Come on it writes itself.</p><p>Spider-Man-Mowgli: Orphaned, agile, heroic, raises by a single adoptive mother. </p><p>Scott Lang-Edward Malone: Again, if you haven&rsquo;t, read the Professor Challenger stories. Malone is a capable man out of his depth dealing with an unpleasant genius and getting into a relationship with said genius&rsquo; daughter.</p><p>Hope Van Dyne-Enid Challenger: The capable businessminded (well journalist) daughter of scientist adventurers.</p><p>Hank Pym-George Challenger: See above. A prickly, egotistical scientist charting unknown worlds and at various times mourning his lost love.</p><p>Janet Pym-Jessica Challenger: Wife of egotistic genius who takes none of his guff.</p><p>Captain Marvel-Alice: I Now this seems like a stretch, but it&rsquo;s partially the chronology (Alice really predates most of these guys) and the idea of a resourceful blonde trapped in an alien world.</p><p>So this was fun to do something with. </p></p>",
