Synopsis: Crowley and Aziraphale attend the theater\nthroughout the years.</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F728117%2Fchapters%2F1351926&amp;t=ZGFkZTRlYzM4ODk3NzExNWVjMzM1NTI4OTA2MDQ0MzIzZGU4MjNkMyxUSkZzRUttRw%3D%3D&amp;p=&amp;m=0\">Crown\nof Thorns: The Walls, The Wainscot, and the Mouse</a> by irisbleufic (E) - If\nyou ever see an A/C fic rec list without this on it, something&rsquo;s gone quite\nwrong. Synopsis: Crowley and Aziraphale move into that cottage on the South\nDowns and begin figuring out just what they mean to each other (and the many\nnew people around them). This ate a couple of my weekends last fall. </p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15972305%2Fchapters%2F37256132&amp;t=MDIyYjgyY2JkODk0NjhjM2Y5YjU4MjVlZDBjZDExZjJlODRjZTliZCxUSkZzRUttRw%3D%3D&amp;p=&amp;m=0\">The\nNext Place</a> by maniacalmole (G) - ok tbh I just discovered maniacalmole and\nI&rsquo;m thrilled bc everything they&rsquo;ve written is fucking great. This is highly\nreminiscent of The Good Place, which I think they acknowledge. Synopsis:\nCrowley dies BUT IT&rsquo;S OK. </p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/12864933/chapters/29383428?show_comments=true&amp;view_full_work=false#bookmark-form\">Modern\nLove</a> by punkfaery (T) &ndash; One of the few fics that really captures the gravitas\nof A&amp;C&rsquo;s immortality. Really lovely; a bit bloody, but truthful. Synopsis: Crowley,\nAziraphale, and a series of significant moments from 1204 to 2015. </p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/1055236\">Trouble in Paradise</a>\nby irisbleufic (M) &ndash; So you could definitely make a rec list that was pure\nirisbleufic, but I&rsquo;m gonna just go with a couple of favorites. This one is,\nwell, hmm, nope, you&rsquo;ll just have to trust me. Synopsis: Aziraphale has a bit\nof a thing about serpents. <br /></p><p><a href=\"http://16410170\">Re-Recalled</a> by Jennistar (T) - this one is so cute, damn. If you need a feel-good fic tied up with a warm fuzzy bow then this is the one for you. Also, bonus, written in the exact style of the novel itself, IMO. Synopsis: Aziraphale is discorporated in the middle of an argument. Everything goes badly, until it doesn&rsquo;t.<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17752469\">such surpassing brightness</a>\nby Handful_of_Silence (G) &ndash; A new challenger enters the ring!! You guys. This\nis brand spanking new and it is so good oh my God. Synopsis: Aziraphale is the\npatron saint of queers and Crowley has a lot of complex feelings about it. </p><p>* </p><p>Finally, while this for sure doesn&rsquo;t deserve such company, have a shameless\nself-promote as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17804114\">Final Temptation</a> by\nrfsmiley (M) - I cannot believe I did this but I took a crack at First Time fic\n<strike><i>and put it online ahhh</i></strike> Synopsis: It doesn&rsquo;t occur to Crowley to\ntempt Aziraphale until approximately 5,900 years into their relationship. </p>",

(Occurs between episode 18 and 19 from season 5)</p><p><b>Warnings:</b> None yet, maybe mention of dead people?</p><p><b>Pairings:</b> Eventual Crowley x OC, slight!Cas x OC, Winchesters x OC</p><p><b>Word count:</b>\u00a03496</p><p><b>A/N: This is my first time posting on Tumblr but I really wanted to post this on here.\u00a0 This story has already been posted on my Wattpad account so if you\u2019ve maybe seen it already that\u2019s probably where.\u00a0 I would really appreciate feed back such as if anyone would like me to continue, so please let me know your thoughts.\u00a0 Sorry for the mistakes if I missed any.\u00a0 I really hope you like it and enjoy!\u00a0\u00a0</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>Sitting in Bobby\u2019s living room, the sounds of a clock ticking away and the sound of Sam typing on his laptop could be heard. \u00a0He was sitting at Bobby\u2019s desk looking for a case while Dean was lying on the couch sipping a beer. \u00a0After the whole thing with Zachariah, Sam felt they needed a win, so he\u2019d been trying to find a case ever since. </p><p>&ldquo;I think I found something in Connecticut.&rdquo; Sam said, gaining Deans attention as he continued to look over the news article he had found.</p><p>&ldquo;What\u2019s up in Connecticut?&rdquo; he replied. \u00a0With beer in hand, he sat up and made his way over to his brother. \u00a0Looking over Sam\u2019s shoulder, a small section of the article in bold letters explained there were a couple missing persons, a few deaths and reports of strange activity.</p><p>&ldquo;According to the article \u2018The town of Kent, Connecticut has been experiencing a string of murder abductions. The residence are in a state of panic since the police don\u2019t have any new leads or new evidence.\u2019\u201d Sam said, quoting part of the article he had read so far. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Placing the now empty bottle on the desk, Dean took the laptop back to where he had been previously sitting. \u00a0As he read through it, most of the information explained how people in the town were going missing and the ones that they did find were already dead with suspicious circumstances. \u00a0The townspeople were panicking since there was so little being done and since the information they currently had only brought the deputies to dead ends. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>&quot;Alright, I\u2019m convinced this is something for us,\u201d Dean said as he continued to read the article, \u201cIt looks like some vamp activity but one of the eyewitnesses said they saw two men abduct a blonde women and they were arguing-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s strange about that?&rdquo; Sam asked cutting his brother off only to receive a bitch face in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Well if you would let me finished then I would have told you that the witness saw one of the men with fangs and the other with black eye.&rdquo; Dean replied with a cocky smirk as he closed the laptop.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would a vamp and a demon be working together on anything, much less to abduct a woman?&rdquo; Sam asked completely unconvinced it was both in the same case.</p><p>&ldquo;Not sure but I think we should go find out anyways, just to be on the safe side.&rdquo; Dean said as he stood and stretched.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u00a0 we should tell Bobby about the plan.\u201d Sam said following his brother to go locate the wheelchair bound man and fill him in.</p><p>Kent, Connecticut</p><p>After the boys arrived in the town, they found a motel and checked in. \u00a0The motel was a little better than the other pay by the hour places. \u00a0It still had a red neon sign out front with standard dingy rooms but they were cleaner than expected with more commodities in them. \u00a0Walking into their room Sam placed the laptop bag on top of the table while Dean but their stuff on the beds.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should go down to the station and get all the information we can.&rdquo; Sam said, as he began to set up the laptop.</p><p>Receiving an \u201cAlright\u201d from Dean, it took the boys around 20 minutes to get dressed and down to the police station. \u00a0Walking into the building they went over the the reception desk and flashed their badges to the lady sitting there.</p><p>&ldquo;Agents Johnson and Andrews, FBI. \u00a0We\u2019d like to speak to the sheriff about the recent missing persons and deaths.&rdquo; Sam said as they tucked their badges back into their blazers.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, right this way gentleman.\u201d She replied with a smile as she led them through the bullpen to the sheriff\u2019s office. \u00a0Knocking on the door, she walked in with the boys and said, &quot;Sheriff these two FBI agents are here about the recent phenomenons that have been happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Looking up from the numerous files scattered on his desk and with sleep deprived eyes the sheriff replied, \u00a0&quot;Thank you Missy, that\u2019ll be all.\u201d to which she nodded and closed the door behind herself. \u00a0 \u201cMay I ask why the FBI are interested in what&rsquo;s happening in our small town?&ldquo; the sheriff asked curiously.</p><p>&quot;Well what is happening in your small town sheriff?&rdquo; Dean asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWell I assume you&rsquo;ve both read the case file, and it&rsquo;s just that, we&rsquo;re not sure what&rsquo;s going on here. \u00a0Nothing is making any sense and the town is becoming more and more restless. \u00a0But I&rsquo;m glad to have any help you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d The sheriff explained with exasperation. \u00a0\u201cIt seems no matter what lead we pursuit or what evidence we have, it all comes to a dead end which leads us back to square one.\u201d</p><p>After taking with the sheriff and taking a copy of the case file with them they left the station and visited the morgue. \u00a0In less than two hours they received all the information they could get from the two men so the boys were currently in their motel room going over everything. \u00a0Sam sat at the table while Dean sat on his bed, each going over different files.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense Dean, what\u2019s so important about this town and why would a demon and vamp supposedly be working together to abduct people.\u201d Sam asked in disbelief, still looking over the file on the latest victim.</p><p>&quot;I&rsquo;m don\u2019t know but something isn&rsquo;t right, I have this weird feeling there&rsquo;s more to all of this we just don\u2019t know about.\u201d Dean replied with uncertainty.</p><p>One hour later</p><p>After reading over most of the information they had, Dean sighed as he placed the file he was reading on the bed and stood up to stretch.</p><p>&quot;Well the only lead we have so far is that witness who supposedly saw the vamp and demon. \u00a0I think we should go and ask,\u201d Dean paused leaning over the bed to look over the witness statement,\u201dMisses Miller and ask her exactly what she saw.&rdquo; Dean said to his brother as he straightened his clothes out and got ready to leave.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>&ldquo;So misses Miller what exactly did you see?&rdquo; Sam asked the woman sitting in the chair across from him and Dean who sat on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I know it sounds crazy and it&rsquo;s completely impossible but, I was walking home and it was around 8pm,\u201d She said recalling the event, \u201d I was about a block away from my house when I saw two men put an unconscious woman in a van. \u00a0But they started fighting shortly after. I was close enough, that when the argument started to get heated, it looked like one of the men\u2019s eyes changed to black while the other man produced fangs.&rdquo; She told the boys rubbing her hands together nervously, hoping they believed her and didn\u2019t think she was crazy like the deputy who took her statement.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you hear what they were fighting about?&rdquo; Dean asked, hoping she could be of more help.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually I did. \u00a0The one with the black eye said to the other one &lsquo;she&rsquo;s not for you she&rsquo;s for \u2018her\u2019, \u201d Misses miller said putting air quotes around the word her before she continued, \u201cand I don&rsquo;t really feel like explaining to the boss why this woman is almost dead because you can\u2019t control yourself&rsquo; after that they just placed the woman in the van and drove off without another word.\u201d She said finishing her encounter. </p><p>&quot;Okay thank you very much for your help Ma\u2019am&rdquo; Sam said to the women as they stood to leave. \u00a0\u201cIf you remember anything else please call.\u201d \u00a0He said as he handed her his card and walked out the door.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next morning Dean woke up to the sound of his phone ringing. \u00a0Groaning he turned over and grabbed it, noticing the clock read 7:30am.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Johnson.&rdquo; Dean answered with a gruff sleep filled voice. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hello agent? we found the latest victim.&rdquo; The sheriff responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Victim? I thought she was missing?&rdquo; Dean said as he sat up, now fully awake.</p><p>&ldquo;She was, until about ten minutes ago when a jogger found her body down by the river.&rdquo; The sheriff replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright we&rsquo;ll meet you down at the morgue.&rdquo; Dean said as he was already out of bed and tapping Sam awake so they could get ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh and agent, it&rsquo;s pretty bad.&rdquo; The sheriff said before he hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Sam asked as he rubbed his eyes trying to wake up.</p><p>\u201cSheriff, said the latest vic just turned up by the river, and it\u2019s not pretty.\u201d Dean explained as they began their long day.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>&ldquo;Agents.&rdquo; The sheriff greeted them with a nod when they showed up at the morgue.</p><p>&ldquo;Sheriff, \u00a0what happened?&rdquo; Sam asked as they walked to the autopsy room.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it seems they took all of her organs and drained her blood. \u00a0But then stitched her back up and dropped her off down by the river.&rdquo; The sheriff explained uneasily as they stopped at the glass showing the coroner working on the body.</p><p>They continued to talk to the sheriff for around half an hour until they left to look at the crime scene. \u00a0After getting everything they could by the river they stopped and got breakfast before returning to the motel. \u00a0The boys had been working since they returned and after sitting there without finding anything new, Dean sighed and asked Sam if he had found anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually I think I found something, the sheriff we&rsquo;ve been talking to, he\u2019s only had the job for about two weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the old sheriff?&rdquo; Dean asked \u00a0curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Well it turns out he disappeared about three weeks ago right around the time strange things started to happen around here.&rdquo; Sam replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Cuz that doesn\u2019t seem suspicious. \u00a0Does he have any family we can talk to?&rdquo; Dean asked, hoping this will be a potential lead.</p><p>&ldquo;His wife left him 14 years ago and she&rsquo;s been off the grid ever since. \u00a0He also has a son and daughter, but his daughter went off the grid about 10 years ago while his son disappeared around the same time he did.&rdquo; Sam explained as he went through the information on his laptop. \u00a0&quot;It also says that his daughter was adopted.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;Anything else?&rdquo; Dean asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Well the coroner&rsquo;s report said that the latest victim had trace amounts of rust, under her fingernails and on her body, that comes from some of the newly renovated houses that were built in the 50&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the connection?&rdquo; </p><p>\u201cNot sure, but I&rsquo;ll keep digging. \u00a0Hopefully there will be a connection between the two.\u201d Sam said as he went back to work.</p><p>20 minutes had gone by before Sam had found some information that would help bring them closer to what was happening.</p><p>\u201cSo get this,\u201d Sam said gaining his brothers attention. \u00a0&quot;The old sheriff, Baxter Jones, he owned more than one house. \u00a0One was where he lived with his family and the other was his childhood home, which was rebuilt in the 50&rsquo;s. \u00a0It just so happens to also have four 4 acres of land.&ldquo; Sam explained pridefully.</p><p>&quot;That&rsquo;s great and all Sammy but we still don&rsquo;t know why a demon and a vamp would tag team or what the old sheriff has to do with all of this.\u201d \u00a0Dean pointed out.</p><p>&quot;Then I guess we&rsquo;re just going to have to ask him when we get there.&rdquo; </p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next day, the boys headed out to Mr.Jones\u2019 childhood home to scout everything out and get the last bit of information they need before they made their move. They parked down the road from the house and out of the sight from the main road so as not to draw any attention, and walked the rest of the way. \u00a0When they got onto the property they found an area of shrubbery close enough to the house to see but not be seen, however they weren\u2019t prepared for the sight in front of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Dean what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Sam asked in a hushed tone with disbelief lacing his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea Sammy but I think we need to get back to the motel and go over everything again before we go anywhere near that house.\u201d Dean replied equally bewildered.</p><p>What they saw was something they never thought anyone would ever see. \u00a0A vampire and demon working together wasn\u2019t the craziest part of the case or even wrong for that matter. \u00a0What was so unbelievable was the group of monsters arguing outside while there were still 9 other figures inside. \u00a0With the position they were in they couldn\u2019t make out the species in the house, but they could tell the group outside was a mix of vamps, wolves, shifters, and demons since the argument caused fangs, claws, and eyes to show. \u00a0The door to the house swung open and a man they recognized as Mr. Jones came storming out. </p><p>\u201cStop it, all of you. \u00a0We have business to finish so get inside and enough of your fighting.\u201d He said aggressively breaking up the fight as he brought everyone inside. \u00a0</p><p>As they went inside Sam and Dean decided it was the best time for them to leave but as they were moving they noticed a girl in one of the bedrooms. \u00a0With this discovery Sam gave Dean a worried look, making the importance of the case even more important or she might not survive.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>When they got back to the motel \u00a0they were in a state of disbelief, shock, and urgency.</p><p>&quot;Okay dude what the hell?&rdquo; Dean asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.\u201d Sam replied.</p><p>&quot;What the hell?&rdquo; Dean said once more trying to make sence of the case.</p><p>&ldquo;Well they said that they had to finish the deal, maybe souls?&rdquo; Sam said uncertainty.</p><p>&ldquo;Well whatever it is we have to end it tonight, they still have a girl who&rsquo;s alive and I\u2019m not letting them take another life.&rdquo; Dean said bleakly.</p><p>&ldquo;Then we better come up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>Time skip</p><p>After 2 hour the boys had their plan. \u00a0They has scouted the place out and were getting ready to enter the house. \u00a0There were 3 shape shifters and 2 demons standing guard outside which they managed to take care of without alerting the others. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>While the boys were dispatching the guards on the left side of the house outside of the kitchen, inside there was a discussion going on between 2 demons, 2 angels, 3 vamp, and Mr. Jones with the girl all in the living room.</p><p>The hallway stretched down the center of the house with four doorways leading to different rooms. \u00a0On the whole left side of the house was the kitchen with the doorway close to the center of the wall. \u00a0On the right side of the house, the first doorway lead to the living room with couch against the front window wall, two fabric chairs against the right outer wall and a desk in front of the inner wall dividing it from the dining room. \u00a0The other doorway at the end of the hall lead to the dining room. \u00a0There&rsquo;s a set of stairs against the living room wall in the hallway which leads to the terrace upstairs. \u00a0The house was very old with little to no cleaning and maintenance done. \u00a0Since no one had lived in the house for long it had gone without care, which really showed. \u00a0</p><p>Mr. Jones sat behind the desk while the girl sat on a wooden chair next to his desk with her body shrunken in on herself and avoiding eye contact with anyone. \u00a0There was a vampire and an angel who occupied the two chairs, while two vampire and a demon sat on the couch. \u00a0The remaining angel and demon were standing and arguing what they thought was the best idea.</p><p>&quot;I think we can get more for her if we wait.\u201d The standing angel said looking at the girl </p><p>&quot;No way if we sell her now then we just up the price and move on.&rdquo; The demon argued hating how the angels were in on the whole thing</p><p>\u201cOh please don\u2019t be stupid. \u00a0If we wait then word can get around and there will be more buyers willing to pay more.\u201d The angel argued going over to the demon and standing in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYeah then next thing you know, there will be hunters knocking down the door trying to get her. \u00a0No we sell her now and move on.\u201d The demon spat.</p><p>With the angel and demon standing chest to chest waiting for the other to make the first move, an argument had started between everyone in the room. \u00a0That is until Mr. Jones raised his voice, shutting everyone up quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Since she&rsquo;s my daughter, I say that we wait to sell her. \u00a0There might be more people interested that way,\u201d He said causing the angel to give a cocky smirk to the demon as Mr. Jones continued. \u00a0\u201cPlus it wouldn\u2019t hurt to see what else she can do.&rdquo; He said with darkness in his voice as he looked at her menacingly.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The boys went through the kitchen where there were a vampire was at the sink and another vampires and 2 werewolf&rsquo;s were sitting at the table playing cards. \u00a0As Sam was dealing with the wolves and as Dean had cut the head off the last vamp, he knocked over a chair, gaining the attention of the others in the house. \u00a0One of the angels disappeared for a couple seconds before returning.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go. \u00a0The Winchesters are here and they killed all the others.\u201d He said </p><p>\u201cGet her upstairs and don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d Mr. Jones ordered one of the vampires as he did just as he was told.</p><p>In a blink of an eye the angels and demons disappeared and went their separate ways while Mr. Jones and the other two vampires remained in the living room. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake care of them and no matter what happens, they can\u2019t take her. \u00a0Do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>He told the remaining two before he snuck out the front door and disappeared into the surrounding wood line. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Dean, seriously?&rdquo; Sam asked in a hushed tone.</p><p>Dean shrugged his shoulder as a response before a vampire barged into the kitchen and lunging for him, only to have Sam swing a millimeter away from his face and take its head clean off. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was a little close there Sammy.\u201d \u00a0He said patting his brother on the shoulder, receiving Sam&rsquo;s bitch face and \u2018really\u2019 look. &ldquo;Anyway let&rsquo;s go get the girl.&rdquo; Dean said leading them out of the kitchen.</p><p>They moved down the hall and reached the stairs where they heard a loud,&ldquo; THUD&rdquo; come from one of the rooms upstairs, they quickly ran up and kicked the door in. The sight that greeted them was the unconscious girl on an old dingy mattress and the two remaining vampires standing by her. \u00a0The one closest to them charged but the boys quickly took care of him. \u00a0The other vampire watched as his friends body fell headless to the ground then looked to the girl before he jumped out the second story window, shattering the glass and running into the forest. \u00a0Now taking a good look at the girl, they noticed she was wearing She wearing a bohemian lace dress with sleeves down to her mid arms. \u00a0She looked as though she hadn\u2019t had a bath in months with how dirty her face, hair and dress was but the boys still thought she was beautiful.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get her back to the motel and try to find out why she was so important to them. \u00a0We can worry about the other vamp later.&rdquo; Dean said while lifting her up in his arms while Sam took the weapons to the impala.</p><p>Lying her along the back seat, Dean moved a strand of hair out of her face and moved her into a comfortable position before closing the door. They made a couple of trips into the house to collect the things in the girls room. \u00a0She had three suitcases and a few backpacks that they took with them. \u00a0They stuck her things in the trunk and checked the rest of the house for anything else. \u00a0</p><p>While looking through the house, the boys discovered a table in the basement covered in blood with restraints attached to it. \u00a0The victims would have been strapped down and bled dry before their insides were harvested. \u00a0Everything from the victim was then placed in jars and stored in the fridge. \u00a0But what remains as a mystery is what they were doing with it since it was obvious Mr. Jones wasn\u2019t letting anyone consume it. \u00a0The boys left the house after the basement discovery and drove the impala as fast as they could back to the motel.</p>",

(Occurs between episode 18 and 19 from season 5)</p><p><b>Warnings:</b> None yet, maybe mention of dead people?</p><p><b>Pairings:</b> Eventual Crowley x OC, slight!Cas x OC, Winchesters x OC</p><p><b>Word count:</b>\u00a03496</p><p><b>A/N: This is my first time posting on Tumblr but I really wanted to post this on here.\u00a0 This story has already been posted on my Wattpad account so if you\u2019ve maybe seen it already that\u2019s probably where.\u00a0 I would really appreciate feed back such as if anyone would like me to continue, so please let me know your thoughts.\u00a0 Sorry for the mistakes if I missed any.\u00a0 I really hope you like it and enjoy!\u00a0\u00a0</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Sitting in Bobby\u2019s living room, the sounds of a clock ticking away and the sound of Sam typing on his laptop could be heard. \u00a0He was sitting at Bobby\u2019s desk looking for a case while Dean was lying on the couch sipping a beer. \u00a0After the whole thing with Zachariah, Sam felt they needed a win, so he\u2019d been trying to find a case ever since. </p><p>\u201cI think I found something in Connecticut.\u201d Sam said, gaining Deans attention as he continued to look over the news article he had found.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up in Connecticut?\u201d he replied. \u00a0With beer in hand, he sat up and made his way over to his brother. \u00a0Looking over Sam\u2019s shoulder, a small section of the article in bold letters explained there were a couple missing persons, a few deaths and reports of strange activity.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the article \u2018The town of Kent, Connecticut has been experiencing a string of murder abductions. The residence are in a state of panic since the police don\u2019t have any new leads or new evidence.\u2019\u201d Sam said, quoting part of the article he had read so far. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Placing the now empty bottle on the desk, Dean took the laptop back to where he had been previously sitting. \u00a0As he read through it, most of the information explained how people in the town were going missing and the ones that they did find were already dead with suspicious circumstances. \u00a0The townspeople were panicking since there was so little being done and since the information they currently had only brought the deputies to dead ends. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\"Alright, I\u2019m convinced this is something for us,\u201d Dean said as he continued to read the article, \u201cIt looks like some vamp activity but one of the eyewitnesses said they saw two men abduct a blonde women and they were arguing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s strange about that?\u201d Sam asked cutting his brother off only to receive a bitch face in return.</p><p>\u201cWell if you would let me finished then I would have told you that the witness saw one of the men with fangs and the other with black eye.\u201d Dean replied with a cocky smirk as he closed the laptop.</p><p>\u201cWhy would a vamp and a demon be working together on anything, much less to abduct a woman?\u201d Sam asked completely unconvinced it was both in the same case.</p><p>\u201cNot sure but I think we should go find out anyways, just to be on the safe side.\u201d Dean said as he stood and stretched.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u00a0 we should tell Bobby about the plan.\u201d Sam said following his brother to go locate the wheelchair bound man and fill him in.</p><p>Kent, Connecticut</p><p>After the boys arrived in the town, they found a motel and checked in. \u00a0The motel was a little better than the other pay by the hour places. \u00a0It still had a red neon sign out front with standard dingy rooms but they were cleaner than expected with more commodities in them. \u00a0Walking into their room Sam placed the laptop bag on top of the table while Dean but their stuff on the beds.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go down to the station and get all the information we can.\u201d Sam said, as he began to set up the laptop.</p><p>Receiving an \u201cAlright\u201d from Dean, it took the boys around 20 minutes to get dressed and down to the police station. \u00a0Walking into the building they went over the the reception desk and flashed their badges to the lady sitting there.</p><p>\u201cAgents Johnson and Andrews, FBI. \u00a0We\u2019d like to speak to the sheriff about the recent missing persons and deaths.\u201d Sam said as they tucked their badges back into their blazers.</p><p>\u201cOf course, right this way gentleman.\u201d She replied with a smile as she led them through the bullpen to the sheriff\u2019s office. \u00a0Knocking on the door, she walked in with the boys and said, \"Sheriff these two FBI agents are here about the recent phenomenons that have been happening.\u201d</p><p>Looking up from the numerous files scattered on his desk and with sleep deprived eyes the sheriff replied, \u00a0\"Thank you Missy, that\u2019ll be all.\u201d to which she nodded and closed the door behind herself. \u00a0 \u201cMay I ask why the FBI are interested in what\u2019s happening in our small town?\u201c the sheriff asked curiously.</p><p>\"Well what is happening in your small town sheriff?\u201d Dean asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWell I assume you\u2019ve both read the case file, and it\u2019s just that, we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on here. \u00a0Nothing is making any sense and the town is becoming more and more restless. \u00a0But I\u2019m glad to have any help you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d The sheriff explained with exasperation. \u00a0\u201cIt seems no matter what lead we pursuit or what evidence we have, it all comes to a dead end which leads us back to square one.\u201d</p><p>After taking with the sheriff and taking a copy of the case file with them they left the station and visited the morgue. \u00a0In less than two hours they received all the information they could get from the two men so the boys were currently in their motel room going over everything. \u00a0Sam sat at the table while Dean sat on his bed, each going over different files.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense Dean, what\u2019s so important about this town and why would a demon and vamp supposedly be working together to abduct people.\u201d Sam asked in disbelief, still looking over the file on the latest victim.</p><p>\"I\u2019m don\u2019t know but something isn\u2019t right, I have this weird feeling there\u2019s more to all of this we just don\u2019t know about.\u201d Dean replied with uncertainty.</p><p>One hour later</p><p>After reading over most of the information they had, Dean sighed as he placed the file he was reading on the bed and stood up to stretch.</p><p>\"Well the only lead we have so far is that witness who supposedly saw the vamp and demon. \u00a0I think we should go and ask,\u201d Dean paused leaning over the bed to look over the witness statement,\u201dMisses Miller and ask her exactly what she saw.\u201d Dean said to his brother as he straightened his clothes out and got ready to leave.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>\u201cSo misses Miller what exactly did you see?\u201d Sam asked the woman sitting in the chair across from him and Dean who sat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWell I know it sounds crazy and it\u2019s completely impossible but, I was walking home and it was around 8pm,\u201d She said recalling the event, \u201d I was about a block away from my house when I saw two men put an unconscious woman in a van. \u00a0But they started fighting shortly after. I was close enough, that when the argument started to get heated, it looked like one of the men\u2019s eyes changed to black while the other man produced fangs.\u201d She told the boys rubbing her hands together nervously, hoping they believed her and didn\u2019t think she was crazy like the deputy who took her statement.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what they were fighting about?\u201d Dean asked, hoping she could be of more help.</p><p>\u201cActually I did. \u00a0The one with the black eye said to the other one \u2018she\u2019s not for you she\u2019s for \u2018her\u2019, \u201d Misses miller said putting air quotes around the word her before she continued, \u201cand I don\u2019t really feel like explaining to the boss why this woman is almost dead because you can\u2019t control yourself\u2019 after that they just placed the woman in the van and drove off without another word.\u201d She said finishing her encounter. </p><p>\"Okay thank you very much for your help Ma\u2019am\u201d Sam said to the women as they stood to leave. \u00a0\u201cIf you remember anything else please call.\u201d \u00a0He said as he handed her his card and walked out the door.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next morning Dean woke up to the sound of his phone ringing. \u00a0Groaning he turned over and grabbed it, noticing the clock read 7:30am.</p><p>\u201cAgent Johnson.\u201d Dean answered with a gruff sleep filled voice. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello agent? we found the latest victim.\u201d The sheriff responded.</p><p>\u201cVictim? I thought she was missing?\u201d Dean said as he sat up, now fully awake.</p><p>\u201cShe was, until about ten minutes ago when a jogger found her body down by the river.\u201d The sheriff replied.</p><p>\u201cAlright we\u2019ll meet you down at the morgue.\u201d Dean said as he was already out of bed and tapping Sam awake so they could get ready.</p><p>\u201cOh and agent, it\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d The sheriff said before he hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Sam asked as he rubbed his eyes trying to wake up.</p><p>\u201cSheriff, said the latest vic just turned up by the river, and it\u2019s not pretty.\u201d Dean explained as they began their long day.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>\u201cAgents.\u201d The sheriff greeted them with a nod when they showed up at the morgue.</p><p>\u201cSheriff, \u00a0what happened?\u201d Sam asked as they walked to the autopsy room.</p><p>\u201cWell, it seems they took all of her organs and drained her blood. \u00a0But then stitched her back up and dropped her off down by the river.\u201d The sheriff explained uneasily as they stopped at the glass showing the coroner working on the body.</p><p>They continued to talk to the sheriff for around half an hour until they left to look at the crime scene. \u00a0After getting everything they could by the river they stopped and got breakfast before returning to the motel. \u00a0The boys had been working since they returned and after sitting there without finding anything new, Dean sighed and asked Sam if he had found anything.</p><p>\u201cActually I think I found something, the sheriff we\u2019ve been talking to, he\u2019s only had the job for about two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the old sheriff?\u201d Dean asked \u00a0curiously.</p><p>\u201cWell it turns out he disappeared about three weeks ago right around the time strange things started to happen around here.\u201d Sam replied.</p><p>\u201cCuz that doesn\u2019t seem suspicious. \u00a0Does he have any family we can talk to?\u201d Dean asked, hoping this will be a potential lead.</p><p>\u201cHis wife left him 14 years ago and she\u2019s been off the grid ever since. \u00a0He also has a son and daughter, but his daughter went off the grid about 10 years ago while his son disappeared around the same time he did.\u201d Sam explained as he went through the information on his laptop. \u00a0\"It also says that his daughter was adopted.\u201c</p><p>\"Anything else?\u201d Dean asked. </p><p>\u201cWell the coroner\u2019s report said that the latest victim had trace amounts of rust, under her fingernails and on her body, that comes from some of the newly renovated houses that were built in the 50\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the connection?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure, but I\u2019ll keep digging. \u00a0Hopefully there will be a connection between the two.\u201d Sam said as he went back to work.</p><p>20 minutes had gone by before Sam had found some information that would help bring them closer to what was happening.</p><p>\u201cSo get this,\u201d Sam said gaining his brothers attention. \u00a0\"The old sheriff, Baxter Jones, he owned more than one house. \u00a0One was where he lived with his family and the other was his childhood home, which was rebuilt in the 50\u2019s. \u00a0It just so happens to also have four 4 acres of land.\u201c Sam explained pridefully.</p><p>\"That\u2019s great and all Sammy but we still don\u2019t know why a demon and a vamp would tag team or what the old sheriff has to do with all of this.\u201d \u00a0Dean pointed out.</p><p>\"Then I guess we\u2019re just going to have to ask him when we get there.\u201d </p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next day, the boys headed out to Mr.Jones\u2019 childhood home to scout everything out and get the last bit of information they need before they made their move. They parked down the road from the house and out of the sight from the main road so as not to draw any attention, and walked the rest of the way. \u00a0When they got onto the property they found an area of shrubbery close enough to the house to see but not be seen, however they weren\u2019t prepared for the sight in front of them.</p><p>\u201cDean what\u2019s going on?\u201d Sam asked in a hushed tone with disbelief lacing his voice.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea Sammy but I think we need to get back to the motel and go over everything again before we go anywhere near that house.\u201d Dean replied equally bewildered.</p><p>What they saw was something they never thought anyone would ever see. \u00a0A vampire and demon working together wasn\u2019t the craziest part of the case or even wrong for that matter. \u00a0What was so unbelievable was the group of monsters arguing outside while there were still 9 other figures inside. \u00a0With the position they were in they couldn\u2019t make out the species in the house, but they could tell the group outside was a mix of vamps, wolves, shifters, and demons since the argument caused fangs, claws, and eyes to show. \u00a0The door to the house swung open and a man they recognized as Mr. Jones came storming out. </p><p>\u201cStop it, all of you. \u00a0We have business to finish so get inside and enough of your fighting.\u201d He said aggressively breaking up the fight as he brought everyone inside. \u00a0</p><p>As they went inside Sam and Dean decided it was the best time for them to leave but as they were moving they noticed a girl in one of the bedrooms. \u00a0With this discovery Sam gave Dean a worried look, making the importance of the case even more important or she might not survive.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>When they got back to the motel \u00a0they were in a state of disbelief, shock, and urgency.</p><p>\"Okay dude what the hell?\u201d Dean asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sam replied.</p><p>\"What the hell?\u201d Dean said once more trying to make sence of the case.</p><p>\u201cWell they said that they had to finish the deal, maybe souls?\u201d Sam said uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cWell whatever it is we have to end it tonight, they still have a girl who\u2019s alive and I\u2019m not letting them take another life.\u201d Dean said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cThen we better come up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>Time skip</p><p>After 2 hour the boys had their plan. \u00a0They has scouted the place out and were getting ready to enter the house. \u00a0There were 3 shape shifters and 2 demons standing guard outside which they managed to take care of without alerting the others. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>While the boys were dispatching the guards on the left side of the house outside of the kitchen, inside there was a discussion going on between 2 demons, 2 angels, 3 vamp, and Mr. Jones with the girl all in the living room.</p><p>The hallway stretched down the center of the house with four doorways leading to different rooms. \u00a0On the whole left side of the house was the kitchen with the doorway close to the center of the wall. \u00a0On the right side of the house, the first doorway lead to the living room with couch against the front window wall, two fabric chairs against the right outer wall and a desk in front of the inner wall dividing it from the dining room. \u00a0The other doorway at the end of the hall lead to the dining room. \u00a0There\u2019s a set of stairs against the living room wall in the hallway which leads to the terrace upstairs. \u00a0The house was very old with little to no cleaning and maintenance done. \u00a0Since no one had lived in the house for long it had gone without care, which really showed. \u00a0</p><p>Mr. Jones sat behind the desk while the girl sat on a wooden chair next to his desk with her body shrunken in on herself and avoiding eye contact with anyone. \u00a0There was a vampire and an angel who occupied the two chairs, while two vampire and a demon sat on the couch. \u00a0The remaining angel and demon were standing and arguing what they thought was the best idea.</p><p>\"I think we can get more for her if we wait.\u201d The standing angel said looking at the girl </p><p>\"No way if we sell her now then we just up the price and move on.\u201d The demon argued hating how the angels were in on the whole thing</p><p>\u201cOh please don\u2019t be stupid. \u00a0If we wait then word can get around and there will be more buyers willing to pay more.\u201d The angel argued going over to the demon and standing in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYeah then next thing you know, there will be hunters knocking down the door trying to get her. \u00a0No we sell her now and move on.\u201d The demon spat.</p><p>With the angel and demon standing chest to chest waiting for the other to make the first move, an argument had started between everyone in the room. \u00a0That is until Mr. Jones raised his voice, shutting everyone up quickly.</p><p>\u201cSince she\u2019s my daughter, I say that we wait to sell her. \u00a0There might be more people interested that way,\u201d He said causing the angel to give a cocky smirk to the demon as Mr. Jones continued. \u00a0\u201cPlus it wouldn\u2019t hurt to see what else she can do.\u201d He said with darkness in his voice as he looked at her menacingly.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The boys went through the kitchen where there were a vampire was at the sink and another vampires and 2 werewolf\u2019s were sitting at the table playing cards. \u00a0As Sam was dealing with the wolves and as Dean had cut the head off the last vamp, he knocked over a chair, gaining the attention of the others in the house. \u00a0One of the angels disappeared for a couple seconds before returning.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go. \u00a0The Winchesters are here and they killed all the others.\u201d He said </p><p>\u201cGet her upstairs and don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d Mr. Jones ordered one of the vampires as he did just as he was told.</p><p>In a blink of an eye the angels and demons disappeared and went their separate ways while Mr. Jones and the other two vampires remained in the living room. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake care of them and no matter what happens, they can\u2019t take her. \u00a0Do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>He told the remaining two before he snuck out the front door and disappeared into the surrounding wood line. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDean, seriously?\u201d Sam asked in a hushed tone.</p><p>Dean shrugged his shoulder as a response before a vampire barged into the kitchen and lunging for him, only to have Sam swing a millimeter away from his face and take its head clean off. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was a little close there Sammy.\u201d \u00a0He said patting his brother on the shoulder, receiving Sam\u2019s bitch face and \u2018really\u2019 look. \u201cAnyway let\u2019s go get the girl.\u201d Dean said leading them out of the kitchen.</p><p>They moved down the hall and reached the stairs where they heard a loud,\u201c THUD\u201d come from one of the rooms upstairs, they quickly ran up and kicked the door in. The sight that greeted them was the unconscious girl on an old dingy mattress and the two remaining vampires standing by her. \u00a0The one closest to them charged but the boys quickly took care of him. \u00a0The other vampire watched as his friends body fell headless to the ground then looked to the girl before he jumped out the second story window, shattering the glass and running into the forest. \u00a0Now taking a good look at the girl, they noticed she was wearing She wearing a bohemian lace dress with sleeves down to her mid arms. \u00a0She looked as though she hadn\u2019t had a bath in months with how dirty her face, hair and dress was but the boys still thought she was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get her back to the motel and try to find out why she was so important to them. \u00a0We can worry about the other vamp later.\u201d Dean said while lifting her up in his arms while Sam took the weapons to the impala.</p><p>Lying her along the back seat, Dean moved a strand of hair out of her face and moved her into a comfortable position before closing the door. They made a couple of trips into the house to collect the things in the girls room. \u00a0She had three suitcases and a few backpacks that they took with them. \u00a0They stuck her things in the trunk and checked the rest of the house for anything else. \u00a0</p><p>While looking through the house, the boys discovered a table in the basement covered in blood with restraints attached to it. \u00a0The victims would have been strapped down and bled dry before their insides were harvested. \u00a0Everything from the victim was then placed in jars and stored in the fridge. \u00a0But what remains as a mystery is what they were doing with it since it was obvious Mr. Jones wasn\u2019t letting anyone consume it. \u00a0The boys left the house after the basement discovery and drove the impala as fast as they could back to the motel.</p>",

The residence are in a state of panic since the police don\u2019t have any new leads or new evidence.\u2019\u201d Sam said, quoting part of the article he had read so far. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Placing the now empty bottle on the desk, Dean took the laptop back to where he had been previously sitting. \u00a0As he read through it, most of the information explained how people in the town were going missing and the ones that they did find were already dead with suspicious circumstances. \u00a0The townspeople were panicking since there was so little being done and since the information they currently had only brought the deputies to dead ends. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\"Alright, I\u2019m convinced this is something for us,\u201d Dean said as he continued to read the article, \u201cIt looks like some vamp activity but one of the eyewitnesses said they saw two men abduct a blonde women and they were arguing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s strange about that?\u201d Sam asked cutting his brother off only to receive a bitch face in return.</p><p>\u201cWell if you would let me finished then I would have told you that the witness saw one of the men with fangs and the other with black eye.\u201d Dean replied with a cocky smirk as he closed the laptop.</p><p>\u201cWhy would a vamp and a demon be working together on anything, much less to abduct a woman?\u201d Sam asked completely unconvinced it was both in the same case.</p><p>\u201cNot sure but I think we should go find out anyways, just to be on the safe side.\u201d Dean said as he stood and stretched.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u00a0 we should tell Bobby about the plan.\u201d Sam said following his brother to go locate the wheelchair bound man and fill him in.</p><p>Kent, Connecticut</p><p>After the boys arrived in the town, they found a motel and checked in. \u00a0The motel was a little better than the other pay by the hour places. \u00a0It still had a red neon sign out front with standard dingy rooms but they were cleaner than expected with more commodities in them. \u00a0Walking into their room Sam placed the laptop bag on top of the table while Dean but their stuff on the beds.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go down to the station and get all the information we can.\u201d Sam said, as he began to set up the laptop.</p><p>Receiving an \u201cAlright\u201d from Dean, it took the boys around 20 minutes to get dressed and down to the police station. \u00a0Walking into the building they went over the the reception desk and flashed their badges to the lady sitting there.</p><p>\u201cAgents Johnson and Andrews, FBI. \u00a0We\u2019d like to speak to the sheriff about the recent missing persons and deaths.\u201d Sam said as they tucked their badges back into their blazers.</p><p>\u201cOf course, right this way gentleman.\u201d She replied with a smile as she led them through the bullpen to the sheriff\u2019s office. \u00a0Knocking on the door, she walked in with the boys and said, \"Sheriff these two FBI agents are here about the recent phenomenons that have been happening.\u201d</p><p>Looking up from the numerous files scattered on his desk and with sleep deprived eyes the sheriff replied, \u00a0\"Thank you Missy, that\u2019ll be all.\u201d to which she nodded and closed the door behind herself. \u00a0 \u201cMay I ask why the FBI are interested in what\u2019s happening in our small town?\u201c the sheriff asked curiously.</p><p>\"Well what is happening in your small town sheriff?\u201d Dean asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWell I assume you\u2019ve both read the case file, and it\u2019s just that, we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on here. \u00a0Nothing is making any sense and the town is becoming more and more restless. \u00a0But I\u2019m glad to have any help you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d The sheriff explained with exasperation. \u00a0\u201cIt seems no matter what lead we pursuit or what evidence we have, it all comes to a dead end which leads us back to square one.\u201d</p><p>After taking with the sheriff and taking a copy of the case file with them they left the station and visited the morgue. \u00a0In less than two hours they received all the information they could get from the two men so the boys were currently in their motel room going over everything. \u00a0Sam sat at the table while Dean sat on his bed, each going over different files.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense Dean, what\u2019s so important about this town and why would a demon and vamp supposedly be working together to abduct people.\u201d Sam asked in disbelief, still looking over the file on the latest victim.</p><p>\"I\u2019m don\u2019t know but something isn\u2019t right, I have this weird feeling there\u2019s more to all of this we just don\u2019t know about.\u201d Dean replied with uncertainty.</p><p>One hour later</p><p>After reading over most of the information they had, Dean sighed as he placed the file he was reading on the bed and stood up to stretch.</p><p>\"Well the only lead we have so far is that witness who supposedly saw the vamp and demon. \u00a0I think we should go and ask,\u201d Dean paused leaning over the bed to look over the witness statement,\u201dMisses Miller and ask her exactly what she saw.\u201d Dean said to his brother as he straightened his clothes out and got ready to leave.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>\u201cSo misses Miller what exactly did you see?\u201d Sam asked the woman sitting in the chair across from him and Dean who sat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWell I know it sounds crazy and it\u2019s completely impossible but, I was walking home and it was around 8pm,\u201d She said recalling the event, \u201d I was about a block away from my house when I saw two men put an unconscious woman in a van. \u00a0But they started fighting shortly after. I was close enough, that when the argument started to get heated, it looked like one of the men\u2019s eyes changed to black while the other man produced fangs.\u201d She told the boys rubbing her hands together nervously, hoping they believed her and didn\u2019t think she was crazy like the deputy who took her statement.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what they were fighting about?\u201d Dean asked, hoping she could be of more help.</p><p>\u201cActually I did. \u00a0The one with the black eye said to the other one \u2018she\u2019s not for you she\u2019s for \u2018her\u2019, \u201d Misses miller said putting air quotes around the word her before she continued, \u201cand I don\u2019t really feel like explaining to the boss why this woman is almost dead because you can\u2019t control yourself\u2019 after that they just placed the woman in the van and drove off without another word.\u201d She said finishing her encounter. </p><p>\"Okay thank you very much for your help Ma\u2019am\u201d Sam said to the women as they stood to leave. \u00a0\u201cIf you remember anything else please call.\u201d \u00a0He said as he handed her his card and walked out the door.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next morning Dean woke up to the sound of his phone ringing. \u00a0Groaning he turned over and grabbed it, noticing the clock read 7:30am.</p><p>\u201cAgent Johnson.\u201d Dean answered with a gruff sleep filled voice. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello agent? we found the latest victim.\u201d The sheriff responded.</p><p>\u201cVictim? I thought she was missing?\u201d Dean said as he sat up, now fully awake.</p><p>\u201cShe was, until about ten minutes ago when a jogger found her body down by the river.\u201d The sheriff replied.</p><p>\u201cAlright we\u2019ll meet you down at the morgue.\u201d Dean said as he was already out of bed and tapping Sam awake so they could get ready.</p><p>\u201cOh and agent, it\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d The sheriff said before he hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Sam asked as he rubbed his eyes trying to wake up.</p><p>\u201cSheriff, said the latest vic just turned up by the river, and it\u2019s not pretty.\u201d Dean explained as they began their long day.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>\u201cAgents.\u201d The sheriff greeted them with a nod when they showed up at the morgue.</p><p>\u201cSheriff, \u00a0what happened?\u201d Sam asked as they walked to the autopsy room.</p><p>\u201cWell, it seems they took all of her organs and drained her blood. \u00a0But then stitched her back up and dropped her off down by the river.\u201d The sheriff explained uneasily as they stopped at the glass showing the coroner working on the body.</p><p>They continued to talk to the sheriff for around half an hour until they left to look at the crime scene. \u00a0After getting everything they could by the river they stopped and got breakfast before returning to the motel. \u00a0The boys had been working since they returned and after sitting there without finding anything new, Dean sighed and asked Sam if he had found anything.</p><p>\u201cActually I think I found something, the sheriff we\u2019ve been talking to, he\u2019s only had the job for about two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the old sheriff?\u201d Dean asked \u00a0curiously.</p><p>\u201cWell it turns out he disappeared about three weeks ago right around the time strange things started to happen around here.\u201d Sam replied.</p><p>\u201cCuz that doesn\u2019t seem suspicious. \u00a0Does he have any family we can talk to?\u201d Dean asked, hoping this will be a potential lead.</p><p>\u201cHis wife left him 14 years ago and she\u2019s been off the grid ever since. \u00a0He also has a son and daughter, but his daughter went off the grid about 10 years ago while his son disappeared around the same time he did.\u201d Sam explained as he went through the information on his laptop. \u00a0\"It also says that his daughter was adopted.\u201c</p><p>\"Anything else?\u201d Dean asked. </p><p>\u201cWell the coroner\u2019s report said that the latest victim had trace amounts of rust, under her fingernails and on her body, that comes from some of the newly renovated houses that were built in the 50\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the connection?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot sure, but I\u2019ll keep digging. \u00a0Hopefully there will be a connection between the two.\u201d Sam said as he went back to work.</p><p>20 minutes had gone by before Sam had found some information that would help bring them closer to what was happening.</p><p>\u201cSo get this,\u201d Sam said gaining his brothers attention. \u00a0\"The old sheriff, Baxter Jones, he owned more than one house. \u00a0One was where he lived with his family and the other was his childhood home, which was rebuilt in the 50\u2019s. \u00a0It just so happens to also have four 4 acres of land.\u201c Sam explained pridefully.</p><p>\"That\u2019s great and all Sammy but we still don\u2019t know why a demon and a vamp would tag team or what the old sheriff has to do with all of this.\u201d \u00a0Dean pointed out.</p><p>\"Then I guess we\u2019re just going to have to ask him when we get there.\u201d </p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next day, the boys headed out to Mr.Jones\u2019 childhood home to scout everything out and get the last bit of information they need before they made their move. They parked down the road from the house and out of the sight from the main road so as not to draw any attention, and walked the rest of the way. \u00a0When they got onto the property they found an area of shrubbery close enough to the house to see but not be seen, however they weren\u2019t prepared for the sight in front of them.</p><p>\u201cDean what\u2019s going on?\u201d Sam asked in a hushed tone with disbelief lacing his voice.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea Sammy but I think we need to get back to the motel and go over everything again before we go anywhere near that house.\u201d Dean replied equally bewildered.</p><p>What they saw was something they never thought anyone would ever see. \u00a0A vampire and demon working together wasn\u2019t the craziest part of the case or even wrong for that matter. \u00a0What was so unbelievable was the group of monsters arguing outside while there were still 9 other figures inside. \u00a0With the position they were in they couldn\u2019t make out the species in the house, but they could tell the group outside was a mix of vamps, wolves, shifters, and demons since the argument caused fangs, claws, and eyes to show. \u00a0The door to the house swung open and a man they recognized as Mr. Jones came storming out. </p><p>\u201cStop it, all of you. \u00a0We have business to finish so get inside and enough of your fighting.\u201d He said aggressively breaking up the fight as he brought everyone inside. \u00a0</p><p>As they went inside Sam and Dean decided it was the best time for them to leave but as they were moving they noticed a girl in one of the bedrooms. \u00a0With this discovery Sam gave Dean a worried look, making the importance of the case even more important or she might not survive.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>When they got back to the motel \u00a0they were in a state of disbelief, shock, and urgency.</p><p>\"Okay dude what the hell?\u201d Dean asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sam replied.</p><p>\"What the hell?\u201d Dean said once more trying to make sence of the case.</p><p>\u201cWell they said that they had to finish the deal, maybe souls?\u201d Sam said uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cWell whatever it is we have to end it tonight, they still have a girl who\u2019s alive and I\u2019m not letting them take another life.\u201d Dean said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cThen we better come up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>Time skip</p><p>After 2 hour the boys had their plan. \u00a0They has scouted the place out and were getting ready to enter the house. \u00a0There were 3 shape shifters and 2 demons standing guard outside which they managed to take care of without alerting the others. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>While the boys were dispatching the guards on the left side of the house outside of the kitchen, inside there was a discussion going on between 2 demons, 2 angels, 3 vamp, and Mr. Jones with the girl all in the living room.</p><p>The hallway stretched down the center of the house with four doorways leading to different rooms. \u00a0On the whole left side of the house was the kitchen with the doorway close to the center of the wall. \u00a0On the right side of the house, the first doorway lead to the living room with couch against the front window wall, two fabric chairs against the right outer wall and a desk in front of the inner wall dividing it from the dining room. \u00a0The other doorway at the end of the hall lead to the dining room. \u00a0There\u2019s a set of stairs against the living room wall in the hallway which leads to the terrace upstairs. \u00a0The house was very old with little to no cleaning and maintenance done. \u00a0Since no one had lived in the house for long it had gone without care, which really showed. \u00a0</p><p>Mr. Jones sat behind the desk while the girl sat on a wooden chair next to his desk with her body shrunken in on herself and avoiding eye contact with anyone. \u00a0There was a vampire and an angel who occupied the two chairs, while two vampire and a demon sat on the couch. \u00a0The remaining angel and demon were standing and arguing what they thought was the best idea.</p><p>\"I think we can get more for her if we wait.\u201d The standing angel said looking at the girl </p><p>\"No way if we sell her now then we just up the price and move on.\u201d The demon argued hating how the angels were in on the whole thing</p><p>\u201cOh please don\u2019t be stupid. \u00a0If we wait then word can get around and there will be more buyers willing to pay more.\u201d The angel argued going over to the demon and standing in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYeah then next thing you know, there will be hunters knocking down the door trying to get her. \u00a0No we sell her now and move on.\u201d The demon spat.</p><p>With the angel and demon standing chest to chest waiting for the other to make the first move, an argument had started between everyone in the room. \u00a0That is until Mr. Jones raised his voice, shutting everyone up quickly.</p><p>\u201cSince she\u2019s my daughter, I say that we wait to sell her. \u00a0There might be more people interested that way,\u201d He said causing the angel to give a cocky smirk to the demon as Mr. Jones continued. \u00a0\u201cPlus it wouldn\u2019t hurt to see what else she can do.\u201d He said with darkness in his voice as he looked at her menacingly.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The boys went through the kitchen where there were a vampire was at the sink and another vampires and 2 werewolf\u2019s were sitting at the table playing cards. \u00a0As Sam was dealing with the wolves and as Dean had cut the head off the last vamp, he knocked over a chair, gaining the attention of the others in the house. \u00a0One of the angels disappeared for a couple seconds before returning.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go. \u00a0The Winchesters are here and they killed all the others.\u201d He said </p><p>\u201cGet her upstairs and don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d Mr. Jones ordered one of the vampires as he did just as he was told.</p><p>In a blink of an eye the angels and demons disappeared and went their separate ways while Mr. Jones and the other two vampires remained in the living room. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake care of them and no matter what happens, they can\u2019t take her. \u00a0Do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>He told the remaining two before he snuck out the front door and disappeared into the surrounding wood line. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDean, seriously?\u201d Sam asked in a hushed tone.</p><p>Dean shrugged his shoulder as a response before a vampire barged into the kitchen and lunging for him, only to have Sam swing a millimeter away from his face and take its head clean off. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was a little close there Sammy.\u201d \u00a0He said patting his brother on the shoulder, receiving Sam\u2019s bitch face and \u2018really\u2019 look. \u201cAnyway let\u2019s go get the girl.\u201d Dean said leading them out of the kitchen.</p><p>They moved down the hall and reached the stairs where they heard a loud,\u201c THUD\u201d come from one of the rooms upstairs, they quickly ran up and kicked the door in. The sight that greeted them was the unconscious girl on an old dingy mattress and the two remaining vampires standing by her. \u00a0The one closest to them charged but the boys quickly took care of him. \u00a0The other vampire watched as his friends body fell headless to the ground then looked to the girl before he jumped out the second story window, shattering the glass and running into the forest. \u00a0Now taking a good look at the girl, they noticed she was wearing She wearing a bohemian lace dress with sleeves down to her mid arms. \u00a0She looked as though she hadn\u2019t had a bath in months with how dirty her face, hair and dress was but the boys still thought she was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get her back to the motel and try to find out why she was so important to them. \u00a0We can worry about the other vamp later.\u201d Dean said while lifting her up in his arms while Sam took the weapons to the impala.</p><p>Lying her along the back seat, Dean moved a strand of hair out of her face and moved her into a comfortable position before closing the door. They made a couple of trips into the house to collect the things in the girls room. \u00a0She had three suitcases and a few backpacks that they took with them. \u00a0They stuck her things in the trunk and checked the rest of the house for anything else. \u00a0</p><p>While looking through the house, the boys discovered a table in the basement covered in blood with restraints attached to it. \u00a0The victims would have been strapped down and bled dry before their insides were harvested. \u00a0Everything from the victim was then placed in jars and stored in the fridge. \u00a0But what remains as a mystery is what they were doing with it since it was obvious Mr. Jones wasn\u2019t letting anyone consume it. \u00a0The boys left the house after the basement discovery and drove the impala as fast as they could back to the motel.</p>",

Sam said as they tucked their badges back into their blazers.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, right this way gentleman.&rdquo; She replied with a smile as she led them through the bullpen to the sheriff&rsquo;s office. &nbsp;Knocking on the door, she walked in with the boys and said, \"Sheriff these two FBI agents are here about the recent phenomenons that have been happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Looking up from the numerous files scattered on his desk and with sleep deprived eyes the sheriff replied, &nbsp;\"Thank you Missy, that&rsquo;ll be all.&rdquo; to which she nodded and closed the door behind herself. &nbsp; &ldquo;May I ask why the FBI are interested in what&rsquo;s happening in our small town?&ldquo; the sheriff asked curiously.</p><p>\"Well what is happening in your small town sheriff?&rdquo; Dean asked suspiciously.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I assume you&rsquo;ve both read the case file, and it&rsquo;s just that, we&rsquo;re not sure what&rsquo;s going on here. &nbsp;Nothing is making any sense and the town is becoming more and more restless. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m glad to have any help you&rsquo;re willing to give.&rdquo; The sheriff explained with exasperation. &nbsp;&ldquo;It seems no matter what lead we pursuit or what evidence we have, it all comes to a dead end which leads us back to square one.&rdquo;</p><p>After taking with the sheriff and taking a copy of the case file with them they left the station and visited the morgue. &nbsp;In less than two hours they received all the information they could get from the two men so the boys were currently in their motel room going over everything. &nbsp;Sam sat at the table while Dean sat on his bed, each going over different files.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense Dean, what&rsquo;s so important about this town and why would a demon and vamp supposedly be working together to abduct people.&rdquo; Sam asked in disbelief, still looking over the file on the latest victim.</p><p>\"I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t know but something isn&rsquo;t right, I have this weird feeling there&rsquo;s more to all of this we just don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo; Dean replied with uncertainty.</p><p>One hour later</p><p>After reading over most of the information they had, Dean sighed as he placed the file he was reading on the bed and stood up to stretch.</p><p>\"Well the only lead we have so far is that witness who supposedly saw the vamp and demon. &nbsp;I think we should go and ask,&rdquo; Dean paused leaning over the bed to look over the witness statement,&rdquo;Misses Miller and ask her exactly what she saw.&rdquo; Dean said to his brother as he straightened his clothes out and got ready to leave.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>&ldquo;So misses Miller what exactly did you see?&rdquo; Sam asked the woman sitting in the chair across from him and Dean who sat on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I know it sounds crazy and it&rsquo;s completely impossible but, I was walking home and it was around 8pm,&rdquo; She said recalling the event, &rdquo; I was about a block away from my house when I saw two men put an unconscious woman in a van. &nbsp;But they started fighting shortly after. I was close enough, that when the argument started to get heated, it looked like one of the men&rsquo;s eyes changed to black while the other man produced fangs.&rdquo; She told the boys rubbing her hands together nervously, hoping they believed her and didn&rsquo;t think she was crazy like the deputy who took her statement.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you hear what they were fighting about?&rdquo; Dean asked, hoping she could be of more help.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually I did. &nbsp;The one with the black eye said to the other one &lsquo;she&rsquo;s not for you she&rsquo;s for &lsquo;her&rsquo;, &rdquo; Misses miller said putting air quotes around the word her before she continued, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t really feel like explaining to the boss why this woman is almost dead because you can&rsquo;t control yourself&rsquo; after that they just placed the woman in the van and drove off without another word.&rdquo; She said finishing her encounter. </p><p>\"Okay thank you very much for your help Ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; Sam said to the women as they stood to leave. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you remember anything else please call.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said as he handed her his card and walked out the door.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next morning Dean woke up to the sound of his phone ringing. &nbsp;Groaning he turned over and grabbed it, noticing the clock read 7:30am.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Johnson.&rdquo; Dean answered with a gruff sleep filled voice. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hello agent? we found the latest victim.&rdquo; The sheriff responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Victim? I thought she was missing?&rdquo; Dean said as he sat up, now fully awake.</p><p>&ldquo;She was, until about ten minutes ago when a jogger found her body down by the river.&rdquo; The sheriff replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright we&rsquo;ll meet you down at the morgue.&rdquo; Dean said as he was already out of bed and tapping Sam awake so they could get ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh and agent, it&rsquo;s pretty bad.&rdquo; The sheriff said before he hung up.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Sam asked as he rubbed his eyes trying to wake up.</p><p>&ldquo;Sheriff, said the latest vic just turned up by the river, and it&rsquo;s not pretty.&rdquo; Dean explained as they began their long day.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>&ldquo;Agents.&rdquo; The sheriff greeted them with a nod when they showed up at the morgue.</p><p>&ldquo;Sheriff, &nbsp;what happened?&rdquo; Sam asked as they walked to the autopsy room.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it seems they took all of her organs and drained her blood. &nbsp;But then stitched her back up and dropped her off down by the river.&rdquo; The sheriff explained uneasily as they stopped at the glass showing the coroner working on the body.</p><p>They continued to talk to the sheriff for around half an hour until they left to look at the crime scene. &nbsp;After getting everything they could by the river they stopped and got breakfast before returning to the motel. &nbsp;The boys had been working since they returned and after sitting there without finding anything new, Dean sighed and asked Sam if he had found anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually I think I found something, the sheriff we&rsquo;ve been talking to, he&rsquo;s only had the job for about two weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the old sheriff?&rdquo; Dean asked &nbsp;curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Well it turns out he disappeared about three weeks ago right around the time strange things started to happen around here.&rdquo; Sam replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Cuz that doesn&rsquo;t seem suspicious. &nbsp;Does he have any family we can talk to?&rdquo; Dean asked, hoping this will be a potential lead.</p><p>&ldquo;His wife left him 14 years ago and she&rsquo;s been off the grid ever since. &nbsp;He also has a son and daughter, but his daughter went off the grid about 10 years ago while his son disappeared around the same time he did.&rdquo; Sam explained as he went through the information on his laptop. &nbsp;\"It also says that his daughter was adopted.&ldquo;</p><p>\"Anything else?&rdquo; Dean asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Well the coroner&rsquo;s report said that the latest victim had trace amounts of rust, under her fingernails and on her body, that comes from some of the newly renovated houses that were built in the 50&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the connection?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not sure, but I&rsquo;ll keep digging. &nbsp;Hopefully there will be a connection between the two.&rdquo; Sam said as he went back to work.</p><p>20 minutes had gone by before Sam had found some information that would help bring them closer to what was happening.</p><p>&ldquo;So get this,&rdquo; Sam said gaining his brothers attention. &nbsp;\"The old sheriff, Baxter Jones, he owned more than one house. &nbsp;One was where he lived with his family and the other was his childhood home, which was rebuilt in the 50&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It just so happens to also have four 4 acres of land.&ldquo; Sam explained pridefully.</p><p>\"That&rsquo;s great and all Sammy but we still don&rsquo;t know why a demon and a vamp would tag team or what the old sheriff has to do with all of this.&rdquo; &nbsp;Dean pointed out.</p><p>\"Then I guess we&rsquo;re just going to have to ask him when we get there.&rdquo; </p><p>Time skip</p><p>The next day, the boys headed out to Mr.Jones&rsquo; childhood home to scout everything out and get the last bit of information they need before they made their move. They parked down the road from the house and out of the sight from the main road so as not to draw any attention, and walked the rest of the way. &nbsp;When they got onto the property they found an area of shrubbery close enough to the house to see but not be seen, however they weren&rsquo;t prepared for the sight in front of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Dean what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Sam asked in a hushed tone with disbelief lacing his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea Sammy but I think we need to get back to the motel and go over everything again before we go anywhere near that house.&rdquo; Dean replied equally bewildered.</p><p>What they saw was something they never thought anyone would ever see. &nbsp;A vampire and demon working together wasn&rsquo;t the craziest part of the case or even wrong for that matter. &nbsp;What was so unbelievable was the group of monsters arguing outside while there were still 9 other figures inside. &nbsp;With the position they were in they couldn&rsquo;t make out the species in the house, but they could tell the group outside was a mix of vamps, wolves, shifters, and demons since the argument caused fangs, claws, and eyes to show. &nbsp;The door to the house swung open and a man they recognized as Mr. Jones came storming out. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop it, all of you. &nbsp;We have business to finish so get inside and enough of your fighting.&rdquo; He said aggressively breaking up the fight as he brought everyone inside. &nbsp;</p><p>As they went inside Sam and Dean decided it was the best time for them to leave but as they were moving they noticed a girl in one of the bedrooms. &nbsp;With this discovery Sam gave Dean a worried look, making the importance of the case even more important or she might not survive.</p><p>Time skip</p><p>When they got back to the motel &nbsp;they were in a state of disbelief, shock, and urgency.</p><p>\"Okay dude what the hell?&rdquo; Dean asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Sam replied.</p><p>\"What the hell?&rdquo; Dean said once more trying to make sence of the case.</p><p>&ldquo;Well they said that they had to finish the deal, maybe souls?&rdquo; Sam said uncertainty.</p><p>&ldquo;Well whatever it is we have to end it tonight, they still have a girl who&rsquo;s alive and I&rsquo;m not letting them take another life.&rdquo; Dean said bleakly.</p><p>&ldquo;Then we better come up with a plan.&rdquo;</p><p>Time skip</p><p>After 2 hour the boys had their plan. &nbsp;They has scouted the place out and were getting ready to enter the house. &nbsp;There were 3 shape shifters and 2 demons standing guard outside which they managed to take care of without alerting the others. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>While the boys were dispatching the guards on the left side of the house outside of the kitchen, inside there was a discussion going on between 2 demons, 2 angels, 3 vamp, and Mr. Jones with the girl all in the living room.</p><p>The hallway stretched down the center of the house with four doorways leading to different rooms. &nbsp;On the whole left side of the house was the kitchen with the doorway close to the center of the wall. &nbsp;On the right side of the house, the first doorway lead to the living room with couch against the front window wall, two fabric chairs against the right outer wall and a desk in front of the inner wall dividing it from the dining room. &nbsp;The other doorway at the end of the hall lead to the dining room. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a set of stairs against the living room wall in the hallway which leads to the terrace upstairs. &nbsp;The house was very old with little to no cleaning and maintenance done. &nbsp;Since no one had lived in the house for long it had gone without care, which really showed. &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Jones sat behind the desk while the girl sat on a wooden chair next to his desk with her body shrunken in on herself and avoiding eye contact with anyone. &nbsp;There was a vampire and an angel who occupied the two chairs, while two vampire and a demon sat on the couch. &nbsp;The remaining angel and demon were standing and arguing what they thought was the best idea.</p><p>\"I think we can get more for her if we wait.&rdquo; The standing angel said looking at the girl </p><p>\"No way if we sell her now then we just up the price and move on.&rdquo; The demon argued hating how the angels were in on the whole thing</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please don&rsquo;t be stupid. &nbsp;If we wait then word can get around and there will be more buyers willing to pay more.&rdquo; The angel argued going over to the demon and standing in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah then next thing you know, there will be hunters knocking down the door trying to get her. &nbsp;No we sell her now and move on.&rdquo; The demon spat.</p><p>With the angel and demon standing chest to chest waiting for the other to make the first move, an argument had started between everyone in the room. &nbsp;That is until Mr. Jones raised his voice, shutting everyone up quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Since she&rsquo;s my daughter, I say that we wait to sell her. &nbsp;There might be more people interested that way,&rdquo; He said causing the angel to give a cocky smirk to the demon as Mr. Jones continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;Plus it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to see what else she can do.&rdquo; He said with darkness in his voice as he looked at her menacingly.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The boys went through the kitchen where there were a vampire was at the sink and another vampires and 2 werewolf&rsquo;s were sitting at the table playing cards. &nbsp;As Sam was dealing with the wolves and as Dean had cut the head off the last vamp, he knocked over a chair, gaining the attention of the others in the house. &nbsp;One of the angels disappeared for a couple seconds before returning.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to go. &nbsp;The Winchesters are here and they killed all the others.&rdquo; He said </p><p>&ldquo;Get her upstairs and don&rsquo;t make a sound.&rdquo; Mr. Jones ordered one of the vampires as he did just as he was told.</p><p>In a blink of an eye the angels and demons disappeared and went their separate ways while Mr. Jones and the other two vampires remained in the living room. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care of them and no matter what happens, they can&rsquo;t take her. &nbsp;Do whatever it takes.&rdquo;</p><p>He told the remaining two before he snuck out the front door and disappeared into the surrounding wood line. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dean, seriously?&rdquo; Sam asked in a hushed tone.</p><p>Dean shrugged his shoulder as a response before a vampire barged into the kitchen and lunging for him, only to have Sam swing a millimeter away from his face and take its head clean off. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That was a little close there Sammy.&rdquo; &nbsp;He said patting his brother on the shoulder, receiving Sam&rsquo;s bitch face and &lsquo;really&rsquo; look. &ldquo;Anyway let&rsquo;s go get the girl.&rdquo; Dean said leading them out of the kitchen.</p><p>They moved down the hall and reached the stairs where they heard a loud,&ldquo; THUD&rdquo; come from one of the rooms upstairs, they quickly ran up and kicked the door in. The sight that greeted them was the unconscious girl on an old dingy mattress and the two remaining vampires standing by her. &nbsp;The one closest to them charged but the boys quickly took care of him. &nbsp;The other vampire watched as his friends body fell headless to the ground then looked to the girl before he jumped out the second story window, shattering the glass and running into the forest. &nbsp;Now taking a good look at the girl, they noticed she was wearing She wearing a bohemian lace dress with sleeves down to her mid arms. &nbsp;She looked as though she hadn&rsquo;t had a bath in months with how dirty her face, hair and dress was but the boys still thought she was beautiful.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get her back to the motel and try to find out why she was so important to them. &nbsp;We can worry about the other vamp later.&rdquo; Dean said while lifting her up in his arms while Sam took the weapons to the impala.</p><p>Lying her along the back seat, Dean moved a strand of hair out of her face and moved her into a comfortable position before closing the door. They made a couple of trips into the house to collect the things in the girls room. &nbsp;She had three suitcases and a few backpacks that they took with them. &nbsp;They stuck her things in the trunk and checked the rest of the house for anything else. &nbsp;</p><p>While looking through the house, the boys discovered a table in the basement covered in blood with restraints attached to it. &nbsp;The victims would have been strapped down and bled dry before their insides were harvested. &nbsp;Everything from the victim was then placed in jars and stored in the fridge. &nbsp;But what remains as a mystery is what they were doing with it since it was obvious Mr. Jones wasn&rsquo;t letting anyone consume it. &nbsp;The boys left the house after the basement discovery and drove the impala as fast as they could back to the motel.</p>",
