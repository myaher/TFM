TJ gets up to leave and Cyrus follows.</p><p>\u201cThanks again for your help.\u201d TJ waves at the elderly couple as they pass on their way out. <br/></p><p>\u201cCongratulations on sixty years of marriage.\u201d Cyrus adds with a smile. <br/>\u201cI think we\u2019re going to need sixty years to work through my list.\u201d Cyrus adds as a joke once they\u2019re on the street but he was serious about it. </p><p>\u201cWith an attitude like that, yeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d TJ scoffs. </p><p>The two boys stop outside of the diner as they were about to head off in different directions. TJ takes a few backwards steps, \u201cBest summer ever starts tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Cyrus swats the air before waving his friend off with a small smile and a light bubbly feeling in the pit of Cyrus\u2019 stomach suggested the best summer ever had already began.</p><hr><p>[<a href=\"http://seriestrash.tumblr.com/post/177954769160/the-list-chapter-two\">Next Chapter</a>]</p>",
