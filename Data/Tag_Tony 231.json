&nbsp;&ldquo;But, Dad, what if we shouldn&rsquo;t keep it a secret? &nbsp;I&rsquo;m strong, even stronger than Steve. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve seen what I can do, so why can&rsquo;t I help? &nbsp;And if you&rsquo;re that concerned about keeping what I can do secret, then why couldn&rsquo;t I just wear a mask or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, the answer is no. &nbsp;End of discussion&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys let Wanda and Pietro train, and they&rsquo;re only a couple years older than me! &nbsp;How am I any different? &nbsp;Why should I be any different?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The twins train with us because Barton says that they can,&rdquo; Dad barked, his brow furrowing in frustration. &nbsp;&ldquo;Since he&rsquo;s one of their responsible adults. &nbsp;And for the record, the twins are eighteen, which is an entire four years older than you, Pete.&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, I know how to add,&rdquo; Peter mumbled under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, <i>child</i>?

Let&rsquo;s talk about this,&rdquo; Tony quickly followed you through the front door, trying to calm you down to no avail.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done talking,&rdquo; you huffed, kicking off your heels as you made your way to the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the third time you haven&rsquo;t shown up. The third!&rdquo; You abruptly slammed the fridge after getting out a bottle of beer, making Tony wince.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry. I really am. Something came up and I couldn&rsquo;t get out of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you keep saying,&rdquo; you sighed, twisting off the bottle cap and taking a long swig.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of me organising these business meetings when Tony Stark, <i>you</i>, don&rsquo;t turn up?&rdquo; You pointed a finger to his chest in your frustration, &ldquo;I love you, Stark, but God, you&rsquo;re a nightmare to work with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you said that. I&rsquo;ve got something to show you.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>Tony took the beer bottle from your hand, ignoring your protests as he put it on the side and took your hand in his before pulling you in the direction of the stairs. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I&rsquo;m not in the mood to- <i>oh</i>, wow,&rdquo; your eyes lit up as you saw the small table set up in Tony&rsquo;s work space with candles, flowers and a large cuddly bear sat on one of the chairs.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, play our song,&rdquo; Tony instructed, the sound of Tina Turner&rsquo;s &lsquo;What&rsquo;s Love Got To Do With It&rsquo; playing out of the speakers.</p><p>It was the song that was playing when you and Tony first met at some cooperate event before he became iron man. Despite his obvious charm and reputation, you were immune to his advances at first. You didn&rsquo;t want to be just another one of his hookups.</p><p>When unforeseen circumstances made you jobless, Stark offered you the job role of his PA. When you accepted the job, you never imagined the chaos that would bring. From iron man, to falling helplessly in love with your boss, you&rsquo;d experienced a whole array of emotions to get to this point.</p><p>You looked over to your boyfriend with a small smile, appreciating the sentiment and effort he&rsquo;d clearly put into all of this.</p><p>&ldquo;How do I know FRIDAY didn&rsquo;t set all this up?&rdquo;</p><p>He gaped at you, offended. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hurt, Y/N,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I need you to close your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not closing my- <i>hey</i>!&rdquo; You scolded as Tony came up behind you, covering your eyes with his hands and leading you further into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Relax, you&rsquo;re so tense,&rdquo; he murmured against your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you surprised? Have you met you?&rdquo; You retorted, worried you&rsquo;d trip over your own feet any minute.</p><p>You felt Tony smile against you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you with that tension later,&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, you can open your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony moved his hands away, the lights taking a little time to adjust to as you saw an iron suit before you.</p><p>It was a slightly smaller than Tony&rsquo;s other ones, with a little engraving of your initials inside the helmet.</p><p>You mouth fell open as you looked between the suit and Tony in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this- is this what I think it is?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded. &ldquo;I know I was pretty against the idea of you having your own suit. I still really hope you never have to use it against anything, but I&rsquo;d rather it be here, you know, just as a precaution.&rdquo;</p><p>You threw your arms around him, capturing his lips in a passionate kiss, which he happily returned.</p><p>The pair of you were so immersed in one another. It was hard to think of anything else as Tony led you backwards against the worktop, various tools and parts falling to the floor as you perched on the edge, letting Tony stand between your legs.</p><p>Your fingers intertwined in the back of his hair as his tongue found yours, deepening the kiss with his hands trailing beneath your dress.</p><p>The constant buzzing from the door reluctantly made you pull away with a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoever it is can wait,&rdquo; Tony pouted, dropping his head to your shoulder and making you chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Coulson is at the door, Mr Stark,&rdquo; FRIDAY announced. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite insistent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, mister. I might even get to test drive my iron suit.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s head shot up as he gave you an unamused look, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll test run it together when there isn&rsquo;t some end of the world crisis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Coulson isn&rsquo;t here for you. He&rsquo;s offering me a job at shield,&rdquo; you said, patting Tony on the shoulder and shuffling off the side.</p><p>Confusion and disbelief crossed Tony&rsquo;s face as he stared back at you.</p><p>&ldquo;You- but- wait, what?&rdquo;</p><p>You straightened out your dress, giving him a reassuring smile, &ldquo;relax. It&rsquo;s just a technician job. But it does mean you&rsquo;ll have to find a new P.A.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony wouldn&rsquo;t admit he didn&rsquo;t need another P.A. until a few days later, instead, he just configured FRIDAY to remind him of the odd bits and pieces.</p><p>He probably could have done that before hiring you, too, but meeting you and falling in love was the best thing he&rsquo;d ever experienced and he never wanted to let you go.</p>",

I still really hope you never have to use it against anything, but I&rsquo;d rather it be here, you know, just as a precaution.&rdquo;</p><p>You threw your arms around him, capturing his lips in a passionate kiss, which he happily returned.</p><p>The pair of you were so immersed in one another. It was hard to think of anything else as Tony led you backwards against the worktop, various tools and parts falling to the floor as you perched on the edge, letting Tony stand between your legs.</p><p>Your fingers intertwined in the back of his hair as his tongue found yours, deepening the kiss with his hands trailing beneath your dress.</p><p>The constant buzzing from the door reluctantly made you pull away with a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoever it is can wait,&rdquo; Tony pouted, dropping his head to your shoulder and making you chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Coulson is at the door, Mr Stark,&rdquo; FRIDAY announced. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite insistent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, mister. I might even get to test drive my iron suit.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s head shot up as he gave you an unamused look, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll test run it together when there isn&rsquo;t some end of the world crisis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Coulson isn&rsquo;t here for you. He&rsquo;s offering me a job at shield,&rdquo; you said, patting Tony on the shoulder and shuffling off the side.</p><p>Confusion and disbelief crossed Tony&rsquo;s face as he stared back at you.</p><p>&ldquo;You- but- wait, what?&rdquo;</p><p>You straightened out your dress, giving him a reassuring smile, &ldquo;relax. It&rsquo;s just a technician job. But it does mean you&rsquo;ll have to find a new P.A.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony wouldn&rsquo;t admit he didn&rsquo;t need another P.A. until a few days later, instead, he just configured FRIDAY to remind him of the odd bits and pieces.</p><p>He probably could have done that before hiring you, too, but meeting you and falling in love was the best thing he&rsquo;d ever experienced and he never wanted to let you go.</p></p>",
