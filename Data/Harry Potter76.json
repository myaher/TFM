I admit he&rsquo;s a fine specimen, but he&rsquo;s not whom\n I would choose being you, anyway\u2026 Seriously? Quidditch for work and \nquidditch in the free time? Such a bore.\u201d</p><p>Pansy \ncontinues her rant but Draco ignores her in favour to check the bustling\n room. Britain&rsquo;s finest witches and wizards wear their best robes for \nThe Event of the Year. And amongst them the ones everyone is willing to \nspend a huge amount of money for charities in exchange for a possibility\n to date, as only the highest bidder wins that favour.</p><p>There is Gabrielle Delacour, a true beauty, only comparable with that of her sister&rsquo;s, and a remarkable wandmaker.</p><p>Talking\n to the Minister is Charlie Weasley, redheaded of course, but admittedly\n attractive, more than that if Draco is honest with himself. Tanned and \nmuscular, his calculated movements hints those of someone who deals with\n unpredictable animals.</p><p>Draco cocks his head. \nThat\u2026 could have been interesting, but his intended bid is for Oliver \nWood, the acclaimed new captain of Puddlemere United, with an impressive\n record of victories.</p><p>The attention of the room is\n on him\u2026 and his interlocutor: the one and only Harry Potter, youngest \nHead Auror in history and a hairdresser nightmare.</p><p>The\n man knows how to wear a gala uniform though; Draco can appreciate a \ngood tailor&rsquo;s job and wonders who the maker is and if he could ask them \nfor a new robe. Someone who can highlight Potter&rsquo;s scrawny frame is a \ngenius. He should ask Pansy, she has the ability to know these kinds of \nthings. On the other side, Draco thinks, maybe that Auror training has \npaid off and Potter is now this side of slender. The right side. The \nexpensive fabric seems to hug his chest and emphasize the muscles in his\n arms and thighs and\u2026 Merlin. Draco blinks and turns his head to look \nelsewhere. He can&rsquo;t help but twitch, uncomfortable in his own clothes. \nPansy is still talking so he focuses on that and soon enough everything \nis in order.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;This is the winning one, I tell you.\u201d She said waving her shiny card. \u201cI&rsquo;m positive my bidding goes for the dragon tamer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he&rsquo;s a Weasley\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got eyes, right?\u201d Well, he does indeed.</p><p>The\n man in question approaches Potter and gives him an amicable pat that \nwould have crumbled lesser men. Potter&rsquo;s back holds the slap admirably, \nthough. Draco can appreciate the tailor&rsquo;s fine job on the back of the \njacket\u2026 and trousers.</p><p>\u201cAttention, please! We are \ngoing to reveal the winners!\u201d A thunderous rumbling of excitement fills \nthe room. Pansy trembles by his side squeezing his arm. Suddenly he has a\n sense of foreboding that makes his stomach turn unpleasantly.</p><p>\u201cPansy\u2026\u201d\n he doesn&rsquo;t finish because in that moment his card explodes in a cloud \nof confetti and accompanying fanfare. He is barely conscious of some \ngasps and murmurs around him but he can only pay attention to the \nletters on his card:</p><blockquote><p>\n \u00a0<i>Congratulations!! Your bid is the winner for a date with Harry Potter! (Thanks for your generous donation)\n</i></p></blockquote><p>Pansy leans over his shoulder. \u201cWell, this is going to be interesting.\u201d</p>",

        "body": "<h2>Journey on the Hogwarts Express</h2><p>When he lifted his head, Carmella tried to discern through the bruises and cuts masking his face, desperate to recognize just one of her father\u2019s features. His usually jovial brown eyes were now slits, his eyelids swollen to size of golf balls, red bleeding into the chocolate of his irises. His sharp nose was crooked, twisted into a 45 degree angle, blood gushing from his nostrils. His welcoming smile, which Carmella had inherited, now featured chapped black lips and chipped front teeth, smeared with blood. </p><p>Yet, seeing her father in such physical pain was not what shattered her heart; it was the shame tainting the warmth of his eyes, as if he were somehow to blame for the rearrangement of his face into a black and blue mess. But he couldn\u2019t be. </p><p>Her father was not the type to be intertwined with trouble, violence, and crime. He was not the type to come home, staining the pristine carpet with blood, hurriedly packing her clothes into a suitcase, whispering nonsensical phrases like \u201cmust escape\u201d and \u201chave to hurry.\u201d He was a quiet and focused, but loving and devoted man, working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the <i>Departement de la Cooperation Magique Internationale</i>. He would make crepes every Sunday morning, buy raspberry gelato when she was missing her mother just a bit too much, drive her to the local pool for her swimming lessons, and travel to the beach at the end of term. He was her everything, her idol, her best friend, especially now that her mother was gone. He couldn\u2019t possibly be to blame.</p><p>\u201c<i>Pardonnes moi,</i>\u201d he uttered, when he had finished ransacking up her room. He approached her and kissed her forehead, tears cascading down his cheeks. </p><p>\u201c<i>Pourquoi?</i> What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ma cherie</i>, you need to leave France. It\u2019s not safe for you here, anymore,\u201d he replied, shooting a furtive glance over his shoulder, scrutinizing the dark street below. </p><p>\u201c<i>Papa, s\u2019il-te-plait!</i> Tell me why you\u2019re so terrified!\u201d Carmella pleaded.</p><p>\u201cA few months ago, when You-Know-Who began recruiting international wizards, to expand his influence I suppose, I was approached by <i>la Republique</i> to go undercover as a Death Eater and obtain information on his possible plans,\u201d he began, running a shaky hand through his jet black hair. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d Carmella tried to process his sudden revelation. And yet, it seemed to make sense. Recently, her father had been coming home from work in the middle of the night, with deep blue bags under his eyes, showing less enthusiasm and interest in his job than usual. She had just attributed this change of schedule to him and the rest of his department fighting against Lord Voldemort, not pretending to join him. </p><p>\u201cCarmella, we don\u2019t have much time,\u201d he exclaimed, grabbing her suitcase and heading for her bedroom door. </p><p>\u201cWait, <i>Papa</i>! What\u2019s changed? Why do we have to leave?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Carmella, you have to leave,\u201d he sighed, turning to face her. \u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s plan worked. He has gained international support with many dark wizards, to the point that he has infiltrated <i>la R\u00e9publique de la Magie</i> and unfortunately\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncovered that you double-crossed him,\u201d Carmella finished, finally grasping the reality that her family was teetering on the verge of implosion, tears welling up in her eyes. \u201cWell, okay, so we\u2019ll disappear! We\u2019ll go to South Africa or Thailand, you know, somewhere where You-Know-Who will never find us!\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head. </p><p>\u201cNo, Carmella! <i>You </i>have to disappear! Don\u2019t you understand? Now that You-Know-Who has discovered that I have betrayed him, you have a massive target on your back. He knows that you are the most important person in my life, so he won\u2019t retaliate by torturing me, but by capturing and killing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t they already attacked you? Isn\u2019t that punishment enough?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>This</i>?\u201d he asked, motioning his face. \u201c<i>This </i>is for not going quietly. Once they find me, and they will, not matter how many times I Disapparated and Apparated to keep them off my scent, <i>this </i>will look like kindergarten\u2019s play compared to what they have in store for me. Trust me Carmella, every moment that I\u2019m with you, I am putting your life in danger.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut, where am I supposed to go? You\u2019re my only family!\u201d she weeped. \u201cHow am I supposed to leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have already made arrangements for you to stay at Hogwarts this year. I am close with the Headmaster, and he\u2019s agreed to admit you to the school and help you find a family to stay with over the summers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re just shipping me off to school, then why can\u2019t I stay at Beauxbatons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Albus Dumbledore is not at Beauxbatons, and he is the only man You-Know-Who has ever been afraid of. I trust him and I trust that as long as you are in his care, you will be safe. I\u2019ve put a lot of thought into this, <i>ma cherie</i>, and it\u2019s the only way to keep You-Know-Who from finding you and hurting you. I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d he added, observing Carmella\u2019s skeptical expression. </p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t come with me. I don\u2019t understand why Dumbledore can\u2019t protect the both of us!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause going underground, hiding from You-Know-Who, constantly looking over your shoulder, that\u2019s no life for a girl like you, who has so much potential ahead of her,\u201d her father replied gently, placing his hands on her shoulders.\u00a0\u201cBesides, your mother would never forgive me if I put you in harm\u2019s way. Once You-Know-Who is caught, I promise I will find my way back to you. But for now, my life will just be too unpredictable,\u201d he added, wiping her tears and pulling her into a tight embrace.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A <i>pop </i>resounded in the empty street outside. Carmella and her father froze, fearing the worst. Slowly, she moved towards the window and slightly pushed the curtains aside. Looking up at her was a man with a long silver beard and flowing hair. He sported brilliant robes of midnight blue, embroidered with golden stars, matching the night sky, and half-moon spectacles were perched upon his crooked nose. </p><p>\u201cDumbledore,\u201d she breathed, bittersweet relief washing over her. She looked back towards her father and forced a smile, a new wave of tears blurring her vision. It was time. </p><p>__________________________________________</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new,\u201d a voice interrupted Carmella\u2019s reverie.</p><p>She looked away from the point on the window she had been fixing for the last hour, reliving her farewell to her father. Sitting in front of her was a teenage boy with shoulder-length black hair, a shadow of facial hair, and a mischievous twinkle in his brown eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re observant,\u201d she replied, her gaze returning to the train window, watching the pastures and farm animals zoom past her.</p><p>\u201cAnything from the trolley, dears?\u201d a kind-faced woman asked from the hallway, pushing a cart filled with sweets and pastries. Carmella was about to refuse, wishing to be left alone so as to lose herself in her thoughts once again, when her stomach thundered loudly. She had gotten so caught up in the whirlwind of leaving her father and the country behind that she had forgotten to eat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll take Bertie Botts\u2019 Every Flavour Beans and some Chocolate Frogs,\u201d the boy answered, pulling out a velvet money bag and counting some gold coins.</p><p>Carmella walked over to the trolley, absorbed all of the options, and ordered some Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Juice. She thanked the woman, handed her some Galleons and returned to her seat, hurriedly opening the packaging of her sweets. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sirius, by the way,\u201d the boy said, between mouthfuls of chocolate. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Carmella,\u201d she replied, after taking a deep swig from her juice.</p><p>\u201cSo, how come I\u2019ve never seen you before? You\u2019re clearly older than 11, so you\u2019re not a first year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I got held back a few years,\u201d Carmella smiled, surprisingly grateful for the distraction from her solemn thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how Hogwarts works,\u201d Sirius laughed. \u201cC\u2019mon, what\u2019s the real reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a transfer student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be the first of your kind. Where from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauxbatons Institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, a French girl! I knew there was something I liked about you.\u201d </p><p>Carmella blushed. She didn\u2019t usually fall for troublemakers, but something about Sirius\u2019s carefree attitude eased her nerves about leaving her whole life behind and starting a new school in a foreign country. </p><p>\u201cWell then, welcome to Hogwarts! If you want, I can give you a comprehensive tour when we get to the castle, teach you the ropes, let you know who you should befriend,\u201d Sirius said, motioning himself, \u201cand who you should avoid. Wait, you haven\u2019t been sorted yet, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, into houses. They don\u2019t have those at Beauxbatons?\u201d Carmella shook her head in response. \u201cOk, well, there are four of them: Gryffindor, the best house, for the brave and the mighty, and then Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin,\u201d he elaborated.</p><p>\u201cYou seem a bit biased. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in Gryffindor?\u201d Carmella grinned.</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Padfoot, where&rsquo;d you get off to?\u201d a voice called from the hallway. A curly-haired boy with round glasses peaked his head through the door of the compartment, a smirk slowly appearing on his freckled face. </p><p>\u201cNevermind, I get it now,\u201d he added, winking at Sirius. He plopped down next to him, grabbing one of his Chocolate Frogs and surveying Carmella with a puzzled expression. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, James, we\u2019ve already established that,\u201d Sirius said, rolling his eyes playfully. \u201cThis is Carmella. She\u2019s from Beauxbatons, as in <i>France</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have more appealing qualities than just my nationality,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd I would be happy to get to know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you would,\u201d James chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Hogwarts accepting transfer students. Must be some pretty special circumstances for Dumbledore to let you in so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, must be. So, what year are you both going into?\u201d Carmella hurriedly changed the subject, not interested in rehashing the mayhem of the past few days to two strangers. </p><p>\u201cFourth,\u201d James and Sirius answered together, not pressing the matter any further.</p><p>\u201cYou do that a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re often confused as twins,\u201d James answered knowingly. Carmella attributed this to some sort of inside joke, due to their completely dichotomous appearance, although their personality traits did seem to align quite perfectly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fourth year too. Maybe you can help me catch up on the coursework?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, who are we to refuse a fellow student in need? Although, I have to warn you, I don\u2019t know how much help we\u2019re going to be. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done homework since March,\u201d Sirius said.</p><p>\u201cOf this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf our first year,\u201d James replied, causing an uproar of laughter from the three. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Two more faces appeared at the door: a tall boy, with shaggy brown hair and a scar on his eyebrow, and a small, mousy boy, already changed into his school robes. </p><p>As the boys sat down in the compartment and introduced themselves to Carmella, she smiled, genuinely, for the first time in what seemed like years. She mentally pinched herself, so as to not be foolishly and naively optimistic that she may be able to return to some sort of normalcy at Hogwarts, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. She looked around at the four joyful faces staring back at her, stuffing another Cauldron Cake into her mouth, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel a wave of hope wash over her. Maybe, just maybe, she could make Hogwarts her home. </p>",

She thanked the woman, handed her some Galleons and returned to her seat, hurriedly opening the packaging of her sweets. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sirius, by the way,\u201d the boy said, between mouthfuls of chocolate. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Carmella,\u201d she replied, after taking a deep swig from her juice.</p><p>\u201cSo, how come I\u2019ve never seen you before? You\u2019re clearly older than 11, so you\u2019re not a first year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I got held back a few years,\u201d Carmella smiled, surprisingly grateful for the distraction from her solemn thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how Hogwarts works,\u201d Sirius laughed. \u201cC\u2019mon, what\u2019s the real reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a transfer student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be the first of your kind. Where from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauxbatons Institute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, a French girl! I knew there was something I liked about you.\u201d </p><p>Carmella blushed. She didn\u2019t usually fall for troublemakers, but something about Sirius\u2019s carefree attitude eased her nerves about leaving her whole life behind and starting a new school in a foreign country. </p><p>\u201cWell then, welcome to Hogwarts! If you want, I can give you a comprehensive tour when we get to the castle, teach you the ropes, let you know who you should befriend,\u201d Sirius said, motioning himself, \u201cand who you should avoid. Wait, you haven\u2019t been sorted yet, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, into houses. They don\u2019t have those at Beauxbatons?\u201d Carmella shook her head in response. \u201cOk, well, there are four of them: Gryffindor, the best house, for the brave and the mighty, and then Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin,\u201d he elaborated.</p><p>\u201cYou seem a bit biased. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in Gryffindor?\u201d Carmella grinned.</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Padfoot, where\u2019d you get off to?\u201d a voice called from the hallway. A curly-haired boy with round glasses peaked his head through the door of the compartment, a smirk slowly appearing on his freckled face. </p><p>\u201cNevermind, I get it now,\u201d he added, winking at Sirius. He plopped down next to him, grabbing one of his Chocolate Frogs and surveying Carmella with a puzzled expression. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, James, we\u2019ve already established that,\u201d Sirius said, rolling his eyes playfully. \u201cThis is Carmella. She\u2019s from Beauxbatons, as in <i>France</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have more appealing qualities than just my nationality,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd I would be happy to get to know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you would,\u201d James chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Hogwarts accepting transfer students. Must be some pretty special circumstances for Dumbledore to let you in so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, must be. So, what year are you both going into?\u201d Carmella hurriedly changed the subject, not interested in rehashing the mayhem of the past few days to two strangers. </p><p>\u201cFourth,\u201d James and Sirius answered together, not pressing the matter any further.</p><p>\u201cYou do that a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re often confused as twins,\u201d James answered knowingly. Carmella attributed this to some sort of inside joke, due to their completely dichotomous appearance, although their personality traits did seem to align quite perfectly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fourth year too. Maybe you can help me catch up on the coursework?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, who are we to refuse a fellow student in need? Although, I have to warn you, I don\u2019t know how much help we\u2019re going to be. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done homework since March,\u201d Sirius said.</p><p>\u201cOf this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf our first year,\u201d James replied, causing an uproar of laughter from the three. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Two more faces appeared at the door: a tall boy, with shaggy brown hair and a scar on his eyebrow, and a small, mousy boy, already changed into his school robes. </p><p>As the boys sat down in the compartment and introduced themselves to Carmella, she smiled, genuinely, for the first time in what seemed like years. She mentally pinched herself, so as to not be foolishly and naively optimistic that she may be able to return to some sort of normalcy at Hogwarts, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. She looked around at the four joyful faces staring back at her, stuffing another Cauldron Cake into her mouth, and she couldn\u2019t help but feel a wave of hope wash over her. Maybe, just maybe, she could make Hogwarts her home. </p></p>",

His usually jovial brown eyes were now slits, his eyelids swollen to size of golf balls, red bleeding into the chocolate of his irises. His sharp nose was crooked, twisted into a 45 degree angle, blood gushing from his nostrils. His welcoming smile, which Carmella had inherited, now featured chapped black lips and chipped front teeth, smeared with blood. </p><p>Yet, seeing her father in such physical pain was not what shattered her heart; it was the shame tainting the warmth of his eyes, as if he were somehow to blame for the rearrangement of his face into a black and blue mess. But he couldn\u2019t be. </p><p>Her father was not the type to be intertwined with trouble, violence, and crime. He was not the type to come home, staining the pristine carpet with blood, hurriedly packing her clothes into a suitcase, whispering nonsensical phrases like \u201cmust escape\u201d and \u201chave to hurry.\u201d He was a quiet and focused, but loving and devoted man, working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the <i>Departement de la Cooperation Magique Internationale</i>. He would make crepes every Sunday morning, buy raspberry gelato when she was missing her mother just a bit too much, drive her to the local pool for her swimming lessons, and travel to the beach at the end of term. He was her everything, her idol, her best friend, especially now that her mother was gone. He couldn\u2019t possibly be to blame.</p><p>\u201c<i>Pardonnes moi,</i>\u201d he uttered, when he had finished ransacking up her room. He approached her and kissed her forehead, tears cascading down his cheeks. </p><p>\u201c<i>Pourquoi?</i> What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ma cherie</i>, you need to leave France. It\u2019s not safe for you here, anymore,\u201d he replied, shooting a furtive glance over his shoulder, scrutinizing the dark street below. </p><p>\u201c<i>Papa, s\u2019il-te-plait!</i> Tell me why you\u2019re so terrified!\u201d Carmella pleaded.</p><p>\u201cA few months ago, when You-Know-Who began recruiting international wizards, to expand his influence I suppose, I was approached by <i>la Republique</i> to go undercover as a Death Eater and obtain information on his possible plans,\u201d he began, running a shaky hand through his jet black hair. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d Carmella tried to process his sudden revelation. And yet, it seemed to make sense. Recently, her father had been coming home from work in the middle of the night, with deep blue bags under his eyes, showing less enthusiasm and interest in his job than usual. She had just attributed this change of schedule to him and the rest of his department fighting against Lord Voldemort, not pretending to join him. </p><p>\u201cCarmella, we don\u2019t have much time,\u201d he exclaimed, grabbing her suitcase and heading for her bedroom door. </p><p>\u201cWait, <i>Papa</i>! What\u2019s changed? Why do we have to leave?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Carmella, you have to leave,\u201d he sighed, turning to face her. \u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s plan worked. He has gained international support with many dark wizards, to the point that he has infiltrated <i>la R\u00e9publique de la Magie</i> and unfortunately\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncovered that you double-crossed him,\u201d Carmella finished, finally grasping the reality that her family was teetering on the verge of implosion, tears welling up in her eyes. \u201cWell, okay, so we\u2019ll disappear! We\u2019ll go to South Africa or Thailand, you know, somewhere where You-Know-Who will never find us!\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head. </p><p>\u201cNo, Carmella! <i>You </i>have to disappear! Don\u2019t you understand? Now that You-Know-Who has discovered that I have betrayed him, you have a massive target on your back. He knows that you are the most important person in my life, so he won\u2019t retaliate by torturing me, but by capturing and killing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t they already attacked you? Isn\u2019t that punishment enough?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>This</i>?\u201d he asked, motioning his face. \u201c<i>This </i>is for not going quietly. Once they find me, and they will, not matter how many times I Disapparated and Apparated to keep them off my scent, <i>this </i>will look like kindergarten\u2019s play compared to what they have in store for me. Trust me Carmella, every moment that I\u2019m with you, I am putting your life in danger.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut, where am I supposed to go? You\u2019re my only family!\u201d she weeped. \u201cHow am I supposed to leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have already made arrangements for you to stay at Hogwarts this year. I am close with the Headmaster, and he\u2019s agreed to admit you to the school and help you find a family to stay with over the summers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re just shipping me off to school, then why can\u2019t I stay at Beauxbatons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Albus Dumbledore is not at Beauxbatons, and he is the only man You-Know-Who has ever been afraid of. I trust him and I trust that as long as you are in his care, you will be safe. I\u2019ve put a lot of thought into this, <i>ma cherie</i>, and it\u2019s the only way to keep You-Know-Who from finding you and hurting you. I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d he added, observing Carmella\u2019s skeptical expression. </p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t come with me. I don\u2019t understand why Dumbledore can\u2019t protect the both of us!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause going underground, hiding from You-Know-Who, constantly looking over your shoulder, that\u2019s no life for a girl like you, who has so much potential ahead of her,\u201d her father replied gently, placing his hands on her shoulders.\u00a0\u201cBesides, your mother would never forgive me if I put you in harm\u2019s way. Once You-Know-Who is caught, I promise I will find my way back to you. But for now, my life will just be too unpredictable,\u201d he added, wiping her tears and pulling her into a tight embrace.\u00a0<br></p><p>A <i>pop </i>resounded in the empty street outside. Carmella and her father froze, fearing the worst. Slowly, she moved towards the window and slightly pushed the curtains aside. Looking up at her was a man with a long silver beard and flowing hair. He sported brilliant robes of midnight blue, embroidered with golden stars, matching the night sky, and half-moon spectacles were perched upon his crooked nose. </p><p>\u201cDumbledore,\u201d she breathed, bittersweet relief washing over her. She looked back towards her father and forced a smile, a new wave of tears blurring her vision. It was time. </p><p>__________________________________________</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new,\u201d a voice interrupted Carmella\u2019s reverie.</p><p>She looked away from the point on the window she had been fixing for the last hour, reliving her farewell to her father. Sitting in front of her was a teenage boy with shoulder-length black hair, a shadow of facial hair, and a mischievous twinkle in his brown eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re observant,\u201d she replied, her gaze returning to the train window, watching the pastures and farm animals zoom past her.</p><p>\u201cAnything from the trolley, dears?\u201d a kind-faced woman asked from the hallway, pushing a cart filled with sweets and pastries. Carmella was about to refuse, wishing to be left alone so as to lose herself in her thoughts once again, when her stomach thundered loudly. She had gotten so caught up in the whirlwind of leaving her father and the country behind that she had forgotten to eat. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll take Bertie Botts\u2019 Every Flavour Beans and some Chocolate Frogs,\u201d the boy answered, pulling out a velvet money bag and counting some gold coins.</p><p>Carmella walked over to the trolley, absorbed all of the options, and ordered some Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Juice.

We&rsquo;ll go to South Africa or Thailand, you know, somewhere where You-Know-Who will never find us!&rdquo;</p><p>Her father shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Carmella! <i>You </i>have to disappear! Don&rsquo;t you understand? Now that You-Know-Who has discovered that I have betrayed him, you have a massive target on your back. He knows that you are the most important person in my life, so he won&rsquo;t retaliate by torturing me, but by capturing and killing you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t they already attacked you? Isn&rsquo;t that punishment enough?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>This</i>?&rdquo; he asked, motioning his face. &ldquo;<i>This </i>is for not going quietly. Once they find me, and they will, not matter how many times I Disapparated and Apparated to keep them off my scent, <i>this </i>will look like kindergarten&rsquo;s play compared to what they have in store for me. Trust me Carmella, every moment that I&rsquo;m with you, I am putting your life in danger.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But, where am I supposed to go? You&rsquo;re my only family!&rdquo; she weeped. &ldquo;How am I supposed to leave you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have already made arrangements for you to stay at Hogwarts this year. I am close with the Headmaster, and he&rsquo;s agreed to admit you to the school and help you find a family to stay with over the summers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re just shipping me off to school, then why can&rsquo;t I stay at Beauxbatons?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because Albus Dumbledore is not at Beauxbatons, and he is the only man You-Know-Who has ever been afraid of. I trust him and I trust that as long as you are in his care, you will be safe. I&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought into this, <i>ma cherie</i>, and it&rsquo;s the only way to keep You-Know-Who from finding you and hurting you. I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; he added, observing Carmella&rsquo;s skeptical expression. </p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand why you can&rsquo;t come with me. I don&rsquo;t understand why Dumbledore can&rsquo;t protect the both of us!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because going underground, hiding from You-Know-Who, constantly looking over your shoulder, that&rsquo;s no life for a girl like you, who has so much potential ahead of her,&rdquo; her father replied gently, placing his hands on her shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;Besides, your mother would never forgive me if I put you in harm&rsquo;s way. Once You-Know-Who is caught, I promise I will find my way back to you. But for now, my life will just be too unpredictable,&rdquo; he added, wiping her tears and pulling her into a tight embrace.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>A <i>pop </i>resounded in the empty street outside. Carmella and her father froze, fearing the worst. Slowly, she moved towards the window and slightly pushed the curtains aside. Looking up at her was a man with a long silver beard and flowing hair. He sported brilliant robes of midnight blue, embroidered with golden stars, matching the night sky, and half-moon spectacles were perched upon his crooked nose. </p><p>&ldquo;Dumbledore,&rdquo; she breathed, bittersweet relief washing over her. She looked back towards her father and forced a smile, a new wave of tears blurring her vision. It was time. </p><p>__________________________________________</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re new,&rdquo; a voice interrupted Carmella&rsquo;s reverie.</p><p>She looked away from the point on the window she had been fixing for the last hour, reliving her farewell to her father. Sitting in front of her was a teenage boy with shoulder-length black hair, a shadow of facial hair, and a mischievous twinkle in his brown eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re observant,&rdquo; she replied, her gaze returning to the train window, watching the pastures and farm animals zoom past her.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything from the trolley, dears?&rdquo; a kind-faced woman asked from the hallway, pushing a cart filled with sweets and pastries. Carmella was about to refuse, wishing to be left alone so as to lose herself in her thoughts once again, when her stomach thundered loudly. She had gotten so caught up in the whirlwind of leaving her father and the country behind that she had forgotten to eat. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll take Bertie Botts&rsquo; Every Flavour Beans and some Chocolate Frogs,&rdquo; the boy answered, pulling out a velvet money bag and counting some gold coins.</p><p>Carmella walked over to the trolley, absorbed all of the options, and ordered some Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Juice. She thanked the woman, handed her some Galleons and returned to her seat, hurriedly opening the packaging of her sweets. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sirius, by the way,&rdquo; the boy said, between mouthfuls of chocolate. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Carmella,&rdquo; she replied, after taking a deep swig from her juice.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how come I&rsquo;ve never seen you before? You&rsquo;re clearly older than 11, so you&rsquo;re not a first year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I got held back a few years,&rdquo; Carmella smiled, surprisingly grateful for the distraction from her solemn thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how Hogwarts works,&rdquo; Sirius laughed. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, what&rsquo;s the real reason?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a transfer student.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must be the first of your kind. Where from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beauxbatons Institute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh, a French girl! I knew there was something I liked about you.&rdquo; </p><p>Carmella blushed. She didn&rsquo;t usually fall for troublemakers, but something about Sirius&rsquo;s carefree attitude eased her nerves about leaving her whole life behind and starting a new school in a foreign country. </p><p>&ldquo;Well then, welcome to Hogwarts! If you want, I can give you a comprehensive tour when we get to the castle, teach you the ropes, let you know who you should befriend,&rdquo; Sirius said, motioning himself, &ldquo;and who you should avoid. Wait, you haven&rsquo;t been sorted yet, have you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you know, into houses. They don&rsquo;t have those at Beauxbatons?&rdquo; Carmella shook her head in response. &ldquo;Ok, well, there are four of them: Gryffindor, the best house, for the brave and the mighty, and then Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin,&rdquo; he elaborated.</p><p>&ldquo;You seem a bit biased. I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re in Gryffindor?&rdquo; Carmella grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Padfoot, where&rsquo;d you get off to?&rdquo; a voice called from the hallway. A curly-haired boy with round glasses peaked his head through the door of the compartment, a smirk slowly appearing on his freckled face. </p><p>&ldquo;Nevermind, I get it now,&rdquo; he added, winking at Sirius. He plopped down next to him, grabbing one of his Chocolate Frogs and surveying Carmella with a puzzled expression. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re new.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, James, we&rsquo;ve already established that,&rdquo; Sirius said, rolling his eyes playfully. &ldquo;This is Carmella. She&rsquo;s from Beauxbatons, as in <i>France</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I have more appealing qualities than just my nationality,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>&ldquo;And I would be happy to get to know them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure you would,&rdquo; James chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of Hogwarts accepting transfer students. Must be some pretty special circumstances for Dumbledore to let you in so late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, must be. So, what year are you both going into?&rdquo; Carmella hurriedly changed the subject, not interested in rehashing the mayhem of the past few days to two strangers. </p><p>&ldquo;Fourth,&rdquo; James and Sirius answered together, not pressing the matter any further.</p><p>&ldquo;You do that a lot?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re often confused as twins,&rdquo; James answered knowingly. Carmella attributed this to some sort of inside joke, due to their completely dichotomous appearance, although their personality traits did seem to align quite perfectly. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fourth year too. Maybe you can help me catch up on the coursework?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, who are we to refuse a fellow student in need? Although, I have to warn you, I don&rsquo;t know how much help we&rsquo;re going to be. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve done homework since March,&rdquo; Sirius said.</p><p>&ldquo;Of this year?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of our first year,&rdquo; James replied, causing an uproar of laughter from the three. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; Two more faces appeared at the door: a tall boy, with shaggy brown hair and a scar on his eyebrow, and a small, mousy boy, already changed into his school robes. </p><p>As the boys sat down in the compartment and introduced themselves to Carmella, she smiled, genuinely, for the first time in what seemed like years. She mentally pinched herself, so as to not be foolishly and naively optimistic that she may be able to return to some sort of normalcy at Hogwarts, but she couldn&rsquo;t help herself. She looked around at the four joyful faces staring back at her, stuffing another Cauldron Cake into her mouth, and she couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a wave of hope wash over her. Maybe, just maybe, she could make Hogwarts her home. </p></p>",
