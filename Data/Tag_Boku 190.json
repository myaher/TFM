Last year we already organized a <a href=\"http://triananero.tumblr.com/post/168327003505/yuki-hayashi-birthday-project\">project dedicated to his birthday</a>, it was pretty grand lol and kind of complicated, we ended up having about a hundred participants from over 20 countries, and the composer was incredibly happy to receive such a gift (not even gonna lie, I\u2019m pretty happy that we managed to make him cry x). So we decided to do something similar this year as well, only it\u2019s going to be <b>WAY LESS COMPLICATED</b> and will literally take you <b>UNDER 5 MINUTES</b>!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a42ccadff9c520bff92219a8a9e04e6/tumblr_inline_pk1v2t2NrT1s1vsec_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p><b>Here\u2019s what you need to do:</b></p><p>1) Go to <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/08rZeiypqi3wFOPO2\">this Google form</a> and leave one (1) wish for the composer.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s it. Literally.</p><p>We\u2019ve procrastinated and now it\u2019s finals hell, so we don\u2019t have much time, but still couldn\u2019t help doing at least something.</p><p>I know that many of us listen to his (and not only his) music for free for obvious reasons, and guys, first of all, I really recommend you to buy at least the CDs with your favorite music to directly support the creators, but if you can\u2019t do it, such projects are literally <i>the least we can do</i> to thank them for the incredible work that they\u2019re doing to make our experience of seeing our favorite characters come to life an unforgettable one. So please, do help us out, especially since it barely requires any effort at all from you! Just try and be creative about it :)</p><p>We\u2019ll translate everything into Japanese, probably put it into some kind of an album and make sure it gets to the composer! I\u2019ll let you know how it goes in January.\u00a0</p><p>His birthday is on December 31st, so please hurry up! We\u2019ll probably wrap things up around 29th-30th.</p><p>You can also do something on your own if you wish! Hayashi-san really appreciates such things, and he absolutely loves it when people draw his dogs (especially Chloe-chan, we can see her on many OSTs covers), so don\u2019t be shy! You can @ him on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hayayu1231\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yukihayashi1231/\">Instagram</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help! Let\u2019s show the composer that his music is really appreciated outside of Japan as well!\u00a0\u1559( * \u2022\u0300 \u15dc \u2022\u0301 * )\u1557</p>",

YES, YES IT IS AND IT GETS BETTER.</p><p>The idea is that sometime within the demise!au storyline Izuku&rsquo;s doctor Shin notices his extreme reactions to the <i>Quil</i> and decides to test it, eventually coming up with the Quirk diagnosis and that&rsquo;s where it all goes spectacularly to shit.</p><p>As mentioned before the Quil is only a base, meaning that if you mix it with other substances you can get different results-</p><h2><b>Izuku&rsquo;s List of Quil Mixes</b>&nbsp; <strike>(Don&rsquo;t let Shin find this)</strike></h2><ul><li>DayQuil (natural form of Quil no effect)<br /></li><li>NyQuil (natural form of Quil, no effect)<br /></li><li><b>ForeverQuil: mix of both dayQuil and nyQuil (Changes perception of time and space) THE ORIGINAL QUIL BASE</b><br /></li><li>EternalQuil: The Quil and redbull (Flight)<br /></li><li>InfinityQuil: The Quil and 20 shots of pure espresso (Speed)<br /></li><li>NeverQuil: The Quil and Vodka (Solumunbust and allows for going through objects like vapour)<br /></li><li>RagnaQuil: ForverQuil Eternal Quil and Infinity Quil all in one (transforms into the Jougumander, can bend atoms)<br /></li><li>DragonQuil: Fireball whisky and Quil (Fire Breathing)<br /></li><li>HauntedQuil: Bloody mary with a shot of Quil (makes him invisible, but leaves behind red residue)<br /></li><li>ZuesQuil: Quil with a small electric charge in it (can short circuit any electronic device&rsquo;s within 100m radius)<br /></li><li>WyvernQuil: Quil mixed with Kerosene (Can breath out Liquid Napalm) <b>Warning:DO NOT MIX WITH DRAGONQuil (if you do, you get UltraDragonQuil!

This is going to be my opinion, and from my point of view. So with that said, I wanted to start with my favourite: Fumikage Tokoyami.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"160\" data-orig-width=\"320\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/724c814007e427d3b6a57cd70a74057a/tumblr_pk1tc76AaR1vbi1yg_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"160\" data-orig-width=\"320\"/></figure><p>We all know him. The short guy with the bird head, his quirk is Dark Shadow and he is one of the strongest students in his class. He is also silent, edgy, and he doesn&rsquo;t talk much. But the question now, is: why is he so edgy? He is described as a &ldquo;chuuni kid&rdquo;, Generally a chuuni acts like\u00a0a mature know-it-all\u00a0and/or thinks they have special powers, no one else has. But why does he act like that? I mean, yes, Tokoyami is going through his teenage phase, but why does he talk the way he does? Why does he act so mature? I&rsquo;ll try to answer those questions.

This scene made us all, or at least most uf us, wonder, if Tokoyami has ever killed someone on accident. He could have simply told them, to leave him alone, or run to safety, but instead of that, he went as far as to tell them, that they would die. Now, we know that quirks usually manifest at the age of four. We don&rsquo;t know, if that&rsquo;s the case with Dark Shadow, but something we know, or at least we can infer, is that Dark Shadow wasn&rsquo;t as strong when Tokoyami was little, as he is now. And something else, we can get out of all of this, is that, probably, that wasn&rsquo;t the first time, Tokoyami lost control. Now the question that arises: In the probable case that he lost control in the past, what exactly happened? Perhaps he injured someone, perhaps he did not. Perhaps, the first time he lost control, Dark Shadow wasn&rsquo;t as strong as he is now, and he didn&rsquo;t cause any major injuries to anyone. Another thing I want to point out, is his room:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"502\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9b41269e6e962e2a3b96d4779ea5bdd/tumblr_pk1tc90UDR1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"502\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"876\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c9964086cc971bd907cfcfa617f39c0/tumblr_pk1tc69joe1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"876\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p>Yes, we have all seen his room in the &ldquo;room contest&rdquo;. As we can all see, his room is as edgy, and dark, as we would expect from him. But the really important thing here, is that, his room is full of stuff, he doesn&rsquo;t actually need. Like his sword, the bat wings, or even his keychains.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"594\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e61e4c8652829665987b27612d74ea5/tumblr_pk1tc58fnq1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"594\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p>He doesn&rsquo;t really need them, and still, he has them just for the &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;. Like really, What normal 15-year-old child would need that? I have even noticed he has a huge comfortable chair in the manga version of his room, which is missing in the anime. After looking at his room, I reached a conclusion: Tokoyami comes from a wealthy family. Yes, perhaps, not as rich as Momo, Iida, or Shoto, but perhaps, Bakugou&rsquo;s level of wealth. It&rsquo;s apparent that his parents allow him to buy all this seemingly &ldquo;unnecessary stuff&rdquo;. But then another question pops out: if his parents are so kind as to allow their kid to get himself a fucking sword and keep it, then why isn&rsquo;t he spoiled? You know, normally the kids who have permission to get whatever they want, would be spoiled, loud brats. (Of course, Momo and Iida are not like that, perhaps, because they received a special type of education when they were little). And Tokoyami is not. The other question is, which parent would actually allow their kid to have a sword, or be as edgy as Tokoyami. Let&rsquo;s be honest, if any of us had a room like his, and talked the same way he does, then, we would constantly have our parents, telling us, to grow up of that phase. But apparently, Toko&rsquo;s parents are not bothered at all, by their kids behaviour. Which means, either they are all edgy/goth, which I doubt, or&hellip; they are missing. The last thing I wanted to point out, is Tokoyami&rsquo;s lack of emotion, whenever he is complimented, or he wins something. Just look at this:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"854\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5a303c74b516dfe7ba293dc938c5c85/tumblr_pk1tc8c7521vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"854\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p>He got third place, and he is not even trying to smile.

This means, that Tokoyami is clearly not used to compliments. He acts as if doing what he does, and trying to exceel at almost everything, (except for academics) is his duty. He doesn&rsquo;t know the meaning of the word chill. Another interesting fact, is that during one of the BNHA drama cd&rsquo;s, Bakugou and Tokoyami, have a conversation in the bus, on their way to the camp. Tokoyami asks Bakugou about Jeanist and his internship, and Bakugou asks him, if he is a normal 15 year old kid. Calling him out on his way of speech, and describing him as an &ldquo;old man&rdquo;. Tokoyami gets angry, and literally menaces to unleash Dark Shadow on him, even knowing that he&rsquo;s at a disadvantage against Bakugou. There we saw his pride: he knows he is strong. And he is also interested and invested in Pro heroes, (not as much as,Deku). He even tried to surpass Hawks during his internship:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"978\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f4e4d4e6f1e2fb29f10880961ab8887/tumblr_pk1tc8agE31vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"978\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p>All this made me think that, perhaps, there&rsquo;s someone, who pressures Tokoyami into being a top Pro Hero.

Another interesting fact, is that during one of the BNHA drama cd\u2019s, Bakugou and Tokoyami, have a conversation in the bus, on their way to the camp. Tokoyami asks Bakugou about Jeanist and his internship, and Bakugou asks him, if he is a normal 15 year old kid. Calling him out on his way of speech, and describing him as an \u201cold man\u201d. Tokoyami gets angry, and literally menaces to unleash Dark Shadow on him, even knowing that he\u2019s at a disadvantage against Bakugou. There we saw his pride: he knows he is strong. And he is also interested and invested in Pro heroes, (not as much as,Deku). He even tried to surpass Hawks during his internship:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"978\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f4e4d4e6f1e2fb29f10880961ab8887/tumblr_pk1tc8agE31vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"978\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"></figure><p>All this made me think that, perhaps, there\u2019s someone, who pressures Tokoyami into being a top Pro Hero.

                "content": "<p><h1>Exploring BNHA characters</h1><p>I have been thinking of starting a section, where I look into some unexplored characters, and analyze what little we know about them, to reach a final conclusion, of what their backstories could be like. This is going to be my opinion, and from my point of view. So with that said, I wanted to start with my favourite: Fumikage Tokoyami.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/724c814007e427d3b6a57cd70a74057a/tumblr_pk1tc76AaR1vbi1yg_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>We all know him. The short guy with the bird head, his quirk is Dark Shadow and he is one of the strongest students in his class. He is also silent, edgy, and he doesn&rsquo;t talk much. But the question now, is: why is he so edgy? He is described as a &ldquo;chuuni kid&rdquo;, Generally a chuuni acts like&nbsp;a mature know-it-all&nbsp;and/or thinks they have special powers, no one else has. But why does he act like that? I mean, yes, Tokoyami is going through his teenage phase, but why does he talk the way he does? Why does he act so mature? I&rsquo;ll try to answer those questions. Now, I&rsquo;m sure everybody remembers this scene:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58971de6af999abde249001c3a99304a/tumblr_pk1tc5GC0W1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Where Tokoyami loses control, and he tells Shouji and Deku that they will die if they don&rsquo;t escape. This scene made us all, or at least most uf us, wonder, if Tokoyami has ever killed someone on accident. He could have simply told them, to leave him alone, or run to safety, but instead of that, he went as far as to tell them, that they would die. Now, we know that quirks usually manifest at the age of four. We don&rsquo;t know, if that&rsquo;s the case with Dark Shadow, but something we know, or at least we can infer, is that Dark Shadow wasn&rsquo;t as strong when Tokoyami was little, as he is now. And something else, we can get out of all of this, is that, probably, that wasn&rsquo;t the first time, Tokoyami lost control. Now the question that arises: In the probable case that he lost control in the past, what exactly happened? Perhaps he injured someone, perhaps he did not. Perhaps, the first time he lost control, Dark Shadow wasn&rsquo;t as strong as he is now, and he didn&rsquo;t cause any major injuries to anyone. Another thing I want to point out, is his room:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9b41269e6e962e2a3b96d4779ea5bdd/tumblr_pk1tc90UDR1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c9964086cc971bd907cfcfa617f39c0/tumblr_pk1tc69joe1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Yes, we have all seen his room in the &ldquo;room contest&rdquo;. As we can all see, his room is as edgy, and dark, as we would expect from him. But the really important thing here, is that, his room is full of stuff, he doesn&rsquo;t actually need. Like his sword, the bat wings, or even his keychains.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e61e4c8652829665987b27612d74ea5/tumblr_pk1tc58fnq1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>He doesn&rsquo;t really need them, and still, he has them just for the &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;. Like really, What normal 15-year-old child would need that? I have even noticed he has a huge comfortable chair in the manga version of his room, which is missing in the anime. After looking at his room, I reached a conclusion: Tokoyami comes from a wealthy family. Yes, perhaps, not as rich as Momo, Iida, or Shoto, but perhaps, Bakugou&rsquo;s level of wealth. It&rsquo;s apparent that his parents allow him to buy all this seemingly &ldquo;unnecessary stuff&rdquo;. But then another question pops out: if his parents are so kind as to allow their kid to get himself a fucking sword and keep it, then why isn&rsquo;t he spoiled? You know, normally the kids who have permission to get whatever they want, would be spoiled, loud brats. (Of course, Momo and Iida are not like that, perhaps, because they received a special type of education when they were little). And Tokoyami is not. The other question is, which parent would actually allow their kid to have a sword, or be as edgy as Tokoyami. Let&rsquo;s be honest, if any of us had a room like his, and talked the same way he does, then, we would constantly have our parents, telling us, to grow up of that phase. But apparently, Toko&rsquo;s parents are not bothered at all, by their kids behaviour. Which means, either they are all edgy/goth, which I doubt, or&hellip; they are missing. The last thing I wanted to point out, is Tokoyami&rsquo;s lack of emotion, whenever he is complimented, or he wins something. Just look at this:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5a303c74b516dfe7ba293dc938c5c85/tumblr_pk1tc8c7521vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>He got third place, and he is not even trying to smile. Not even after a hug from All Might. Or here:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b7a79ed16ca962e803a3b207cec5264/tumblr_pk1tc6Yh9e1vbi1yg_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>He looks surprised after Deku&rsquo;s compliment.
