        "caption": "<h2>Day Twelve</h2><p><b>Gendry and Arya are tricked by the other Stark siblings into going under the mistletoe.</b></p><!-- more --><p>Arya\u2019s skin was tanned from the Braavosi sun, she had been studying mathematics at the University of Braavos. Growing up, she had always dreamed of going to the University of Winterfell, like her father and her elder brothers, Robb and Jon. However, her fencing coach Jorah Moormont convinced her to apply and to see what could happen, there was no harm in applying. He had even trained there himself, but decided not to go pro after a shoulder injury. But then she got a full-ride scholarship and it was impossible for her to say no. She\u2019d be in the warm, Braavosi sun all day, learn a new language, get to explore Essos, and not give up fencing, something her mother always pursed her lips at. \u00a0She couldn\u2019t stop beaming about it for weeks, her excitement was plastered on her face. That was until she told Gendry of her plans.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going?\u201d he croaked, unable to look at her, his hands played with his hair, nervously twisting each short strand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call and text you all the time, it\u2019s not like Braavos doesn\u2019t have service,\u201d she reasoned, laying her head on Gendry\u2019s chest. Things had gotten much more familiar for them lately, and she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. Gendry was her best friend and she could definitely see herself with him, she\u2019d be lying if she said she hadn\u2019t thought about it once or twice. But he was Gendry, the boy she met when she was eleven years old and he had moved to Winterfell from King\u2019s Landing after his mom died, and he came over to her house with Jon and Robb. They immediately became friends, because with Jon and Robb, Arya always followed. He was her best friend, she didn\u2019t want to ruin it, and for what, a hunch that he may like her that way. It was more likely that he pitied her and simply saw her as a little sister. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be the same, Arya.\u201d He stroked her hair, and placed a small kiss on the top of her head, \u201cBut I\u2019m happy, you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hair behind her \u00a0shoulder, gathering it all to one side, letting the long, dark brown curls fall. It had grown much longer since she left Winterfell in June, then it had only just grazed her shoulders, now it cascaded down her back. \u00a0It was unmanageable most of the times, frizzing out whenever she dared to take a brush to it, so she usually pulled it up into a messy bun. It had distinct highlights from the Braavosi sun, particularly around her face, adding dimension and shine. </p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Ned called, bringing her attention back to their family breakfast. She was still a bit jet lagged, so she ate her pancakes at a monotonous pace. She took a bite of her scrambled eggs, and pursed her lips slightly as they were lacking salt.</p><p> \u00a0\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u00a0she looked at him as she put in their piece of food in her mouth.</p><p> \u201cHow was your flight, not too much turbulence right?\u201d \u00a0he asked, taking a sip of coffee from his world\u2019s best dad mug, a gift from Sansa for Father\u2019s Day a few years back.</p><p>\u201cNone at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I know how much you hate it,\u201d he smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Braavos been?\u201d Her mother inquired, her waist-length red hair was piled on top of her head in a bun, and her usually made up face was clean of makeup.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been good,\u201d she answered abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYour classes are okay? Didn\u2019t you say your economics professor was a bit difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was challenging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nicknamed her \u2018the waif,\u201d Rickon interjected, his red curls were still unruly as ever, it surprised Arya that her mother hadn\u2019t made him get a haircut.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m sure you did well, darling,\u201d Cat added, \u201cThat was your last final before you flew home right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Arya agreed, \u201cI think I\u2019ll get my results by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully you didn\u2019t do too well,\u201d Bran jokes, \u201cThat way you\u2019ll be forced to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd trade the Braavosi sun for the blistering winter winds?\u201d She laughed, \u201cWouldn\u2019t ever dream of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Ned commanded the room with his strong voice, \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here in for a little bit, especially for the holiday party.\u201d </p><p>Oh the dreaded holiday party, the annual Stark tradtiion that usually left Arya groaning and searching for the nearest spiked eggnog curtesy of Theon. </p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Catelyn grinned, \u201cIf your final was one day later you would\u2019ve missed it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Arya muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cThis year, even the Tyrell\u2019s are attending,\u201d Sansa exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that may be because you\u2019re dating their son,\u201d Robb chimed in.</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you four?\u201d Bran asked. </p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re five,\u201d Arya laughed. </p><p>Her younger brother gave her a knowing look, while the rest of the family finished their breakfast, ignoring Sansa and Robb\u2019s spat. \u00a0She knew they all missed her and she felt the same about them too. But, here in Winterfell she was always a Stark first. People saw her as the governor\u2019s daughter, then as Jon and Robb\u2019s little sister, even as the less refined and less beautiful sister to Sansa. In Braavos, no one knew her as anything other than Arya. Wicked at math, fencing, and who could definitely hold her own in a drinking competition against the boys, but that talent she wouldn\u2019t share with her more than conservative parents. They still thought arranged marriages weren\u2019t the worst idea, seeing as they\u2019d been in one, and noble blood in Westeros still had to remain pure, particularly for the Starks .</p><p>In Braavos she dated a bit, but nothing was ever serious. She was too focused on her studies, but that didn\u2019t mean she and her friends didn\u2019t go out together and find their way back to their dorms the next morning.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Sansa knocked on her door, \u201cAre you getting ready for the Christmas party?\u201d</p><p>The Starks were throwing their annual Christmas Party, which felt more like a ball to Arya. The highest members of society were invited and everyone dressed in black tie attire. It was professionally catered, decorated to the nines, and to anyone who came to see it, it felt like you were walking into a winter wonderland filled with champagne, mistletoes, and cheesy Christmas music. Arya was never one for parties or dresses or presenting herself to society, so to say she wasn\u2019t too keen for the party would be an understatement. \u00a0</p><p>Sansa knocked again before Arya groaned and reluctantly got up to answer her sister\u2019s obnoxious pleas.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d her elder sister exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re not even showered!\u201d The redhead had her hair French braided and tied into a fancy up-do on top of her head while she was wearing an emerald green, floor-length strapless gown with a bit of ruching detailing along the bust. Her makeup was delicate, with a soft peach lip and blush to match accompanied with a simple winged eye-liner and cut-crease eyeshadow. Arya could hear the tapping of her four-inch heels, making Sansa even taller than most models through her door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showered,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d her elder sister rolled her eyes, \u201cHop to it,\u201d she pushed her younger sister into her bathroom, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you\u2019re ready, we have less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well be,\u201d Sansa quipped, \u201cMother\u2019s getting the last details arranged and she\u2019s already greeting guests, who actually shows up early to an event like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lannisters,\u201d Arya jokes.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it was them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a stab in the dark,\u201d she called as she stepped into the scorching hot shower. Its water felt like heaven against her back and on her scars. Fencing in Braavos was much more of a contact sport than it was in Winterfell and she had multiple cuts, scrapes, and bruises all over her arms, back, and legs from her intensive training at the House of Black and White, the local fencing gym. It was world-renowned and had produced fencing legends like Syrio Forel and Jaqen H'ghar. Both of whom had trained her and were her mentors, they truly believed she could become a professional, only if she quit school and dedicated her entire life to fencing.</p><p>She clicked off the water and before she could even wrap a towel around her body her elder sister was calling from her bedroom, \u201cMother picked your dress out for you, I laid it out on your bed. Osha should be in, in a few minutes to do your hair and makeup.\u201d</p><p>Arya opened the bathroom door and saw the midnight blue, strapless gown her mother had selected. It wasn\u2019t the worst in the world, and if she had to pick a dress, this one would probably be at the top of the list.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Sansa urged, \u201cI know this isn\u2019t your thing, and that you hate these high society events, but please,\u201d she begged, \u201cCan we have fun. I even had mother invite Gendry for you.\u201d</p><p>Arya blushed immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d Sansa gave her a knowing smirk, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do the finishing touches on my hair.\u201d</p><p>Arya stepped into the dress and zipped it up, but was struggling a bit, \u201cHere let me get that for you Miss Arya,\u201d Osha, her mother\u2019s makeup artist of over twenty years offerred. </p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you it\u2019s just Arya,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Osha engulfed her in a huge bear hug, \u201cIt\u2019s been forever, little Arya. It only seems like yesterday I was getting you ready for your first Winter Ball.\u201d </p><p>Arya gave a small smile. </p><p>\u201cOh come on dear, it\u2019s not nearly as bad as you think, plus you look marvelous. Finally let your hair grow past your shoulders, I think I can actually braid it this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take a miracle to make it look as refined as Sansa\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell good thing I\u2019m a miracle worker.\u201d She took the two-inch barrel curling iron to Arya\u2019s long chestnut colored locks and made thick, bouncy curls that flowed down her back.

            "comment": "<p><h2>Day Twelve</h2><p><b>Gendry and Arya are tricked by the other Stark siblings into going under the mistletoe.</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>Arya\u2019s skin was tanned from the Braavosi sun, she had been studying mathematics at the University of Braavos. Growing up, she had always dreamed of going to the University of Winterfell, like her father and her elder brothers, Robb and Jon. However, her fencing coach Jorah Moormont convinced her to apply and to see what could happen, there was no harm in applying. He had even trained there himself, but decided not to go pro after a shoulder injury. But then she got a full-ride scholarship and it was impossible for her to say no. She\u2019d be in the warm, Braavosi sun all day, learn a new language, get to explore Essos, and not give up fencing, something her mother always pursed her lips at. \u00a0She couldn\u2019t stop beaming about it for weeks, her excitement was plastered on her face. That was until she told Gendry of her plans.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going?\u201d he croaked, unable to look at her, his hands played with his hair, nervously twisting each short strand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call and text you all the time, it\u2019s not like Braavos doesn\u2019t have service,\u201d she reasoned, laying her head on Gendry\u2019s chest. Things had gotten much more familiar for them lately, and she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. Gendry was her best friend and she could definitely see herself with him, she\u2019d be lying if she said she hadn\u2019t thought about it once or twice. But he was Gendry, the boy she met when she was eleven years old and he had moved to Winterfell from King\u2019s Landing after his mom died, and he came over to her house with Jon and Robb. They immediately became friends, because with Jon and Robb, Arya always followed. He was her best friend, she didn\u2019t want to ruin it, and for what, a hunch that he may like her that way. It was more likely that he pitied her and simply saw her as a little sister. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be the same, Arya.\u201d He stroked her hair, and placed a small kiss on the top of her head, \u201cBut I\u2019m happy, you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hair behind her \u00a0shoulder, gathering it all to one side, letting the long, dark brown curls fall. It had grown much longer since she left Winterfell in June, then it had only just grazed her shoulders, now it cascaded down her back. \u00a0It was unmanageable most of the times, frizzing out whenever she dared to take a brush to it, so she usually pulled it up into a messy bun. It had distinct highlights from the Braavosi sun, particularly around her face, adding dimension and shine. </p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Ned called, bringing her attention back to their family breakfast. She was still a bit jet lagged, so she ate her pancakes at a monotonous pace. She took a bite of her scrambled eggs, and pursed her lips slightly as they were lacking salt.</p><p> \u00a0\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u00a0she looked at him as she put in their piece of food in her mouth.</p><p> \u201cHow was your flight, not too much turbulence right?\u201d \u00a0he asked, taking a sip of coffee from his world\u2019s best dad mug, a gift from Sansa for Father\u2019s Day a few years back.</p><p>\u201cNone at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I know how much you hate it,\u201d he smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Braavos been?\u201d Her mother inquired, her waist-length red hair was piled on top of her head in a bun, and her usually made up face was clean of makeup.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been good,\u201d she answered abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYour classes are okay? Didn\u2019t you say your economics professor was a bit difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was challenging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nicknamed her \u2018the waif,\u201d Rickon interjected, his red curls were still unruly as ever, it surprised Arya that her mother hadn\u2019t made him get a haircut.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m sure you did well, darling,\u201d Cat added, \u201cThat was your last final before you flew home right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Arya agreed, \u201cI think I\u2019ll get my results by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully you didn\u2019t do too well,\u201d Bran jokes, \u201cThat way you\u2019ll be forced to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd trade the Braavosi sun for the blistering winter winds?\u201d She laughed, \u201cWouldn\u2019t ever dream of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Ned commanded the room with his strong voice, \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here in for a little bit, especially for the holiday party.\u201d </p><p>Oh the dreaded holiday party, the annual Stark tradtiion that usually left Arya groaning and searching for the nearest spiked eggnog curtesy of Theon. </p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Catelyn grinned, \u201cIf your final was one day later you would\u2019ve missed it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Arya muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cThis year, even the Tyrell\u2019s are attending,\u201d Sansa exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that may be because you\u2019re dating their son,\u201d Robb chimed in.</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you four?\u201d Bran asked. </p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re five,\u201d Arya laughed. </p><p>Her younger brother gave her a knowing look, while the rest of the family finished their breakfast, ignoring Sansa and Robb\u2019s spat. \u00a0She knew they all missed her and she felt the same about them too. But, here in Winterfell she was always a Stark first. People saw her as the governor\u2019s daughter, then as Jon and Robb\u2019s little sister, even as the less refined and less beautiful sister to Sansa. In Braavos, no one knew her as anything other than Arya. Wicked at math, fencing, and who could definitely hold her own in a drinking competition against the boys, but that talent she wouldn\u2019t share with her more than conservative parents. They still thought arranged marriages weren\u2019t the worst idea, seeing as they\u2019d been in one, and noble blood in Westeros still had to remain pure, particularly for the Starks .</p><p>In Braavos she dated a bit, but nothing was ever serious. She was too focused on her studies, but that didn\u2019t mean she and her friends didn\u2019t go out together and find their way back to their dorms the next morning.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Sansa knocked on her door, \u201cAre you getting ready for the Christmas party?\u201d</p><p>The Starks were throwing their annual Christmas Party, which felt more like a ball to Arya. The highest members of society were invited and everyone dressed in black tie attire. It was professionally catered, decorated to the nines, and to anyone who came to see it, it felt like you were walking into a winter wonderland filled with champagne, mistletoes, and cheesy Christmas music. Arya was never one for parties or dresses or presenting herself to society, so to say she wasn\u2019t too keen for the party would be an understatement. \u00a0</p><p>Sansa knocked again before Arya groaned and reluctantly got up to answer her sister\u2019s obnoxious pleas.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d her elder sister exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re not even showered!\u201d The redhead had her hair French braided and tied into a fancy up-do on top of her head while she was wearing an emerald green, floor-length strapless gown with a bit of ruching detailing along the bust. Her makeup was delicate, with a soft peach lip and blush to match accompanied with a simple winged eye-liner and cut-crease eyeshadow. Arya could hear the tapping of her four-inch heels, making Sansa even taller than most models through her door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showered,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d her elder sister rolled her eyes, \u201cHop to it,\u201d she pushed her younger sister into her bathroom, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you\u2019re ready, we have less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well be,\u201d Sansa quipped, \u201cMother\u2019s getting the last details arranged and she\u2019s already greeting guests, who actually shows up early to an event like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lannisters,\u201d Arya jokes.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it was them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a stab in the dark,\u201d she called as she stepped into the scorching hot shower. Its water felt like heaven against her back and on her scars. Fencing in Braavos was much more of a contact sport than it was in Winterfell and she had multiple cuts, scrapes, and bruises all over her arms, back, and legs from her intensive training at the House of Black and White, the local fencing gym. It was world-renowned and had produced fencing legends like Syrio Forel and Jaqen H'ghar. Both of whom had trained her and were her mentors, they truly believed she could become a professional, only if she quit school and dedicated her entire life to fencing.</p><p>She clicked off the water and before she could even wrap a towel around her body her elder sister was calling from her bedroom, \u201cMother picked your dress out for you, I laid it out on your bed. Osha should be in, in a few minutes to do your hair and makeup.\u201d</p><p>Arya opened the bathroom door and saw the midnight blue, strapless gown her mother had selected. It wasn\u2019t the worst in the world, and if she had to pick a dress, this one would probably be at the top of the list.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Sansa urged, \u201cI know this isn\u2019t your thing, and that you hate these high society events, but please,\u201d she begged, \u201cCan we have fun. I even had mother invite Gendry for you.\u201d</p><p>Arya blushed immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d Sansa gave her a knowing smirk, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do the finishing touches on my hair.\u201d</p><p>Arya stepped into the dress and zipped it up, but was struggling a bit, \u201cHere let me get that for you Miss Arya,\u201d Osha, her mother\u2019s makeup artist of over twenty years offerred. </p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you it\u2019s just Arya,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Osha engulfed her in a huge bear hug, \u201cIt\u2019s been forever, little Arya. It only seems like yesterday I was getting you ready for your first Winter Ball.\u201d </p><p>Arya gave a small smile. </p><p>\u201cOh come on dear, it\u2019s not nearly as bad as you think, plus you look marvelous. Finally let your hair grow past your shoulders, I think I can actually braid it this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take a miracle to make it look as refined as Sansa\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell good thing I\u2019m a miracle worker.\u201d She took the two-inch barrel curling iron to Arya\u2019s long chestnut colored locks and made thick, bouncy curls that flowed down her back. She tied the front section in a half-up half down style braid, leaving the rest of the curls loose. Finishing off the style with a simple blue-rose pin, placed directly in the center of her hair. Arya looked at herself in the mirror and gasped. </p><p>\u201cA blue winter rose,\u201d Osha smiled.</p><p>\u201cA blue winter rose, indeed,\u201d Jon agreed.</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Arya burst out of the chair, barely missing the hot curling iron as she clobered him with a giant bear hug. </p><p>\u201cHello to you too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were coming, Robb said you couldn\u2019t get leave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTold you she\u2019d buy it,\u201d Robb appeared in the doorway with Theon.</p><p>\u201cYou clean up pretty well, little wolf,\u201d Theon acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Theon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d her elder brothers agreed, \u201cFour-months in Braavos and you\u2019ve come back a whole new person.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh shut-up,\u201d she smacked Robb\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Jon extended his arm to her.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d </p><p>The party was in full swing, the Tyrells, Targaryens, and Baratheons were in attendance. Robb was dancing with his girlfriend Jeyne, while Jon was desperately flirting with Daenerys Targaryen, and Theon was trying to tell a crude joke to every single server at the party.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Sansa gathered her elder brothers and Theon, \u201cIs Gendry here yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe texted that he\u2019s on his way, work went a bit late,\u201d Jon answered. </p><p>\u201cGood, there\u2019s a mistletoe right at the entrance, we have to get him and Arya there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, why?\u201d Robb asked shocked.</p><p>Sansa smacked him, \u201cWhy do I keep getting smacked,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re stupid,\u201d Sansa answered. </p><p>\u201cYeah, even I know Red\u2019s plan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, would someone please catch me up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe need to get Arya and Gendry under the mistletoe.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo they can what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRobb Stark, I cannot believe you\u2019re the heir to the Winterfell fortune,\u201d Theon groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all equal heirs, it isn\u2019t medieval times.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBesides the point,\u201d Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGenry like Arya and Arya likes Gendry, there, now I\u2019ve said it so can we please get a move on,\u201d Jon said. </p><p>\u201cShe what?

Growing up, she had always dreamed of going to the University of Winterfell, like her father and her elder brothers, Robb and Jon. However, her fencing coach Jorah Moormont convinced her to apply and to see what could happen, there was no harm in applying. He had even trained there himself, but decided not to go pro after a shoulder injury. But then she got a full-ride scholarship and it was impossible for her to say no. She\u2019d be in the warm, Braavosi sun all day, learn a new language, get to explore Essos, and not give up fencing, something her mother always pursed her lips at. \u00a0She couldn\u2019t stop beaming about it for weeks, her excitement was plastered on her face. That was until she told Gendry of her plans.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going?\u201d he croaked, unable to look at her, his hands played with his hair, nervously twisting each short strand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call and text you all the time, it\u2019s not like Braavos doesn\u2019t have service,\u201d she reasoned, laying her head on Gendry\u2019s chest. Things had gotten much more familiar for them lately, and she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about it. Gendry was her best friend and she could definitely see herself with him, she\u2019d be lying if she said she hadn\u2019t thought about it once or twice. But he was Gendry, the boy she met when she was eleven years old and he had moved to Winterfell from King\u2019s Landing after his mom died, and he came over to her house with Jon and Robb. They immediately became friends, because with Jon and Robb, Arya always followed. He was her best friend, she didn\u2019t want to ruin it, and for what, a hunch that he may like her that way. It was more likely that he pitied her and simply saw her as a little sister. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be the same, Arya.\u201d He stroked her hair, and placed a small kiss on the top of her head, \u201cBut I\u2019m happy, you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hair behind her \u00a0shoulder, gathering it all to one side, letting the long, dark brown curls fall. It had grown much longer since she left Winterfell in June, then it had only just grazed her shoulders, now it cascaded down her back. \u00a0It was unmanageable most of the times, frizzing out whenever she dared to take a brush to it, so she usually pulled it up into a messy bun. It had distinct highlights from the Braavosi sun, particularly around her face, adding dimension and shine. </p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Ned called, bringing her attention back to their family breakfast. She was still a bit jet lagged, so she ate her pancakes at a monotonous pace. She took a bite of her scrambled eggs, and pursed her lips slightly as they were lacking salt.</p><p> \u00a0\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u00a0she looked at him as she put in their piece of food in her mouth.</p><p> \u201cHow was your flight, not too much turbulence right?\u201d \u00a0he asked, taking a sip of coffee from his world\u2019s best dad mug, a gift from Sansa for Father\u2019s Day a few years back.</p><p>\u201cNone at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I know how much you hate it,\u201d he smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Braavos been?\u201d Her mother inquired, her waist-length red hair was piled on top of her head in a bun, and her usually made up face was clean of makeup.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been good,\u201d she answered abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYour classes are okay? Didn\u2019t you say your economics professor was a bit difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was challenging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nicknamed her \u2018the waif,\u201d Rickon interjected, his red curls were still unruly as ever, it surprised Arya that her mother hadn\u2019t made him get a haircut.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m sure you did well, darling,\u201d Cat added, \u201cThat was your last final before you flew home right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Arya agreed, \u201cI think I\u2019ll get my results by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully you didn\u2019t do too well,\u201d Bran jokes, \u201cThat way you\u2019ll be forced to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd trade the Braavosi sun for the blistering winter winds?\u201d She laughed, \u201cWouldn\u2019t ever dream of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Ned commanded the room with his strong voice, \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here in for a little bit, especially for the holiday party.\u201d </p><p>Oh the dreaded holiday party, the annual Stark tradtiion that usually left Arya groaning and searching for the nearest spiked eggnog curtesy of Theon. </p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Catelyn grinned, \u201cIf your final was one day later you would\u2019ve missed it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Arya muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cThis year, even the Tyrell\u2019s are attending,\u201d Sansa exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that may be because you\u2019re dating their son,\u201d Robb chimed in.</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you four?\u201d Bran asked. </p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re five,\u201d Arya laughed. </p><p>Her younger brother gave her a knowing look, while the rest of the family finished their breakfast, ignoring Sansa and Robb\u2019s spat. \u00a0She knew they all missed her and she felt the same about them too. But, here in Winterfell she was always a Stark first. People saw her as the governor\u2019s daughter, then as Jon and Robb\u2019s little sister, even as the less refined and less beautiful sister to Sansa. In Braavos, no one knew her as anything other than Arya. Wicked at math, fencing, and who could definitely hold her own in a drinking competition against the boys, but that talent she wouldn\u2019t share with her more than conservative parents. They still thought arranged marriages weren\u2019t the worst idea, seeing as they\u2019d been in one, and noble blood in Westeros still had to remain pure, particularly for the Starks .</p><p>In Braavos she dated a bit, but nothing was ever serious. She was too focused on her studies, but that didn\u2019t mean she and her friends didn\u2019t go out together and find their way back to their dorms the next morning.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Sansa knocked on her door, \u201cAre you getting ready for the Christmas party?\u201d</p><p>The Starks were throwing their annual Christmas Party, which felt more like a ball to Arya. The highest members of society were invited and everyone dressed in black tie attire. It was professionally catered, decorated to the nines, and to anyone who came to see it, it felt like you were walking into a winter wonderland filled with champagne, mistletoes, and cheesy Christmas music. Arya was never one for parties or dresses or presenting herself to society, so to say she wasn\u2019t too keen for the party would be an understatement. \u00a0</p><p>Sansa knocked again before Arya groaned and reluctantly got up to answer her sister\u2019s obnoxious pleas.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d her elder sister exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re not even showered!\u201d The redhead had her hair French braided and tied into a fancy up-do on top of her head while she was wearing an emerald green, floor-length strapless gown with a bit of ruching detailing along the bust. Her makeup was delicate, with a soft peach lip and blush to match accompanied with a simple winged eye-liner and cut-crease eyeshadow. Arya could hear the tapping of her four-inch heels, making Sansa even taller than most models through her door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showered,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d her elder sister rolled her eyes, \u201cHop to it,\u201d she pushed her younger sister into her bathroom, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you\u2019re ready, we have less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well be,\u201d Sansa quipped, \u201cMother\u2019s getting the last details arranged and she\u2019s already greeting guests, who actually shows up early to an event like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lannisters,\u201d Arya jokes.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it was them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a stab in the dark,\u201d she called as she stepped into the scorching hot shower. Its water felt like heaven against her back and on her scars. Fencing in Braavos was much more of a contact sport than it was in Winterfell and she had multiple cuts, scrapes, and bruises all over her arms, back, and legs from her intensive training at the House of Black and White, the local fencing gym. It was world-renowned and had produced fencing legends like Syrio Forel and Jaqen H'ghar. Both of whom had trained her and were her mentors, they truly believed she could become a professional, only if she quit school and dedicated her entire life to fencing.</p><p>She clicked off the water and before she could even wrap a towel around her body her elder sister was calling from her bedroom, \u201cMother picked your dress out for you, I laid it out on your bed. Osha should be in, in a few minutes to do your hair and makeup.\u201d</p><p>Arya opened the bathroom door and saw the midnight blue, strapless gown her mother had selected. It wasn\u2019t the worst in the world, and if she had to pick a dress, this one would probably be at the top of the list.</p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Sansa urged, \u201cI know this isn\u2019t your thing, and that you hate these high society events, but please,\u201d she begged, \u201cCan we have fun. I even had mother invite Gendry for you.\u201d</p><p>Arya blushed immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d Sansa gave her a knowing smirk, \u201cI\u2019ve got to do the finishing touches on my hair.\u201d</p><p>Arya stepped into the dress and zipped it up, but was struggling a bit, \u201cHere let me get that for you Miss Arya,\u201d Osha, her mother\u2019s makeup artist of over twenty years offerred. </p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you it\u2019s just Arya,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Osha engulfed her in a huge bear hug, \u201cIt\u2019s been forever, little Arya. It only seems like yesterday I was getting you ready for your first Winter Ball.\u201d </p><p>Arya gave a small smile. </p><p>\u201cOh come on dear, it\u2019s not nearly as bad as you think, plus you look marvelous. Finally let your hair grow past your shoulders, I think I can actually braid it this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take a miracle to make it look as refined as Sansa\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell good thing I\u2019m a miracle worker.\u201d She took the two-inch barrel curling iron to Arya\u2019s long chestnut colored locks and made thick, bouncy curls that flowed down her back. She tied the front section in a half-up half down style braid, leaving the rest of the curls loose. Finishing off the style with a simple blue-rose pin, placed directly in the center of her hair. Arya looked at herself in the mirror and gasped. </p><p>\u201cA blue winter rose,\u201d Osha smiled.</p><p>\u201cA blue winter rose, indeed,\u201d Jon agreed.</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Arya burst out of the chair, barely missing the hot curling iron as she clobered him with a giant bear hug. </p><p>\u201cHello to you too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were coming, Robb said you couldn\u2019t get leave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTold you she\u2019d buy it,\u201d Robb appeared in the doorway with Theon.</p><p>\u201cYou clean up pretty well, little wolf,\u201d Theon acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Theon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d her elder brothers agreed, \u201cFour-months in Braavos and you\u2019ve come back a whole new person.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh shut-up,\u201d she smacked Robb\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Jon extended his arm to her.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d </p><p>The party was in full swing, the Tyrells, Targaryens, and Baratheons were in attendance. Robb was dancing with his girlfriend Jeyne, while Jon was desperately flirting with Daenerys Targaryen, and Theon was trying to tell a crude joke to every single server at the party.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Sansa gathered her elder brothers and Theon, \u201cIs Gendry here yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe texted that he\u2019s on his way, work went a bit late,\u201d Jon answered. </p><p>\u201cGood, there\u2019s a mistletoe right at the entrance, we have to get him and Arya there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, why?\u201d Robb asked shocked.</p><p>Sansa smacked him, \u201cWhy do I keep getting smacked,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re stupid,\u201d Sansa answered. </p><p>\u201cYeah, even I know Red\u2019s plan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, would someone please catch me up.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe need to get Arya and Gendry under the mistletoe.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo they can what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRobb Stark, I cannot believe you\u2019re the heir to the Winterfell fortune,\u201d Theon groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all equal heirs, it isn\u2019t medieval times.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBesides the point,\u201d Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGenry like Arya and Arya likes Gendry, there, now I\u2019ve said it so can we please get a move on,\u201d Jon said. </p><p>\u201cShe what? He does? How? No. You\u2019re kidding.\u201d </p><p>Gendry had been shown into the party by the Stark\u2019s main steward, Jory Cassel and he felt so out of place. He had his best suit on and a gift for the hosts tucked under his arm. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to see his father, they had never been on the best of terms, but he didn\u2019t doubt he was here. </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cJust find Jon and Robb and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill talking to yourself,\u201d a familiar voice called behind him.</p><p>He turned around to see Arya wearing a dress, a sight he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d see, even at all the previous Christmas parties she managed to wear black jeans and claim it was black tie. Her hair was curled perfectly and she had a small amount of makeup on, making her look ethereal. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he croaked out.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she responded, shyly looking at the floor.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Braavos been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Warm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd the shop?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe same, pretty busy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d they both said at the same time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d she laughed. </p><p>\u201cYou look really good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks, so do you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he teased, \u201cI think we\u2019re under a mistletoe.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we are.\u201d </p><p>He leaned in for a kiss and she reached up as well.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t even need to trick them.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Arya broke her kiss, \u201cWhy I oughta.\u201d </p><p>\u201cArya,\u201d Gendry said, gently grabbing her face, \u201cWe\u2019ll get them back later.\u201d And he reached in to kiss her again. </p></p>",

Both of whom had trained her and were her mentors, they truly believed she could become a professional, only if she quit school and dedicated her entire life to fencing.</p><p>She clicked off the water and before she could even wrap a towel around her body her elder sister was calling from her bedroom, &ldquo;Mother picked your dress out for you, I laid it out on your bed. Osha should be in, in a few minutes to do your hair and makeup.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya opened the bathroom door and saw the midnight blue, strapless gown her mother had selected. It wasn&rsquo;t the worst in the world, and if she had to pick a dress, this one would probably be at the top of the list.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya,&rdquo; Sansa urged, &ldquo;I know this isn&rsquo;t your thing, and that you hate these high society events, but please,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;Can we have fun. I even had mother invite Gendry for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya blushed immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to it,&rdquo; Sansa gave her a knowing smirk, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do the finishing touches on my hair.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya stepped into the dress and zipped it up, but was struggling a bit, &ldquo;Here let me get that for you Miss Arya,&rdquo; Osha, her mother&rsquo;s makeup artist of over twenty years offerred. </p><p>&ldquo;How many times do I have to tell you it&rsquo;s just Arya,&rdquo; she laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; Osha engulfed her in a huge bear hug, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been forever, little Arya. It only seems like yesterday I was getting you ready for your first Winter Ball.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya gave a small smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on dear, it&rsquo;s not nearly as bad as you think, plus you look marvelous. Finally let your hair grow past your shoulders, I think I can actually braid it this year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take a miracle to make it look as refined as Sansa&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well good thing I&rsquo;m a miracle worker.&rdquo; She took the two-inch barrel curling iron to Arya&rsquo;s long chestnut colored locks and made thick, bouncy curls that flowed down her back. She tied the front section in a half-up half down style braid, leaving the rest of the curls loose. Finishing off the style with a simple blue-rose pin, placed directly in the center of her hair. Arya looked at herself in the mirror and gasped. </p><p>&ldquo;A blue winter rose,&rdquo; Osha smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;A blue winter rose, indeed,&rdquo; Jon agreed.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; Arya burst out of the chair, barely missing the hot curling iron as she clobered him with a giant bear hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello to you too,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you were coming, Robb said you couldn&rsquo;t get leave.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Told you she&rsquo;d buy it,&rdquo; Robb appeared in the doorway with Theon.</p><p>&ldquo;You clean up pretty well, little wolf,&rdquo; Theon acknowledged.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Theon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; her elder brothers agreed, &ldquo;Four-months in Braavos and you&rsquo;ve come back a whole new person.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut-up,&rdquo; she smacked Robb&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; Jon extended his arm to her.</p><p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ll ever be.&rdquo; </p><p>The party was in full swing, the Tyrells, Targaryens, and Baratheons were in attendance. Robb was dancing with his girlfriend Jeyne, while Jon was desperately flirting with Daenerys Targaryen, and Theon was trying to tell a crude joke to every single server at the party.</p><p>&ldquo;Guys,&rdquo; Sansa gathered her elder brothers and Theon, &ldquo;Is Gendry here yet.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He texted that he&rsquo;s on his way, work went a bit late,&rdquo; Jon answered. </p><p>&ldquo;Good, there&rsquo;s a mistletoe right at the entrance, we have to get him and Arya there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What, why?&rdquo; Robb asked shocked.</p><p>Sansa smacked him, &ldquo;Why do I keep getting smacked,&rdquo; he whined.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re stupid,&rdquo; Sansa answered. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, even I know Red&rsquo;s plan.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, would someone please catch me up.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We need to get Arya and Gendry under the mistletoe.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So they can what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Robb Stark, I cannot believe you&rsquo;re the heir to the Winterfell fortune,&rdquo; Theon groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all equal heirs, it isn&rsquo;t medieval times.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Besides the point,&rdquo; Sansa rolled her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Genry like Arya and Arya likes Gendry, there, now I&rsquo;ve said it so can we please get a move on,&rdquo; Jon said. </p><p>&ldquo;She what? He does? How? No. You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo; </p><p>Gendry had been shown into the party by the Stark&rsquo;s main steward, Jory Cassel and he felt so out of place. He had his best suit on and a gift for the hosts tucked under his arm. He hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t have to see his father, they had never been on the best of terms, but he didn&rsquo;t doubt he was here. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;Just find Jon and Robb and you&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Still talking to yourself,&rdquo; a familiar voice called behind him.</p><p>He turned around to see Arya wearing a dress, a sight he&rsquo;d never thought he&rsquo;d see, even at all the previous Christmas parties she managed to wear black jeans and claim it was black tie. Her hair was curled perfectly and she had a small amount of makeup on, making her look ethereal. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he croaked out.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she responded, shyly looking at the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Braavos been?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Warm.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And the shop?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The same, pretty busy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; they both said at the same time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ditto,&rdquo; she laughed. </p><p>&ldquo;You look really good.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, so do you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he teased, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re under a mistletoe.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say we are.&rdquo; </p><p>He leaned in for a kiss and she reached up as well.</p><p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even need to trick them.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Arya broke her kiss, &ldquo;Why I oughta.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Arya,&rdquo; Gendry said, gently grabbing her face, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them back later.&rdquo; And he reached in to kiss her again. </p></p>",
