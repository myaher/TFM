        "body": "<p>My year-off between college and grad school was one of the lowest moments of my life. I had moved to my grandmother&rsquo;s home in Italy to take care of her, as she had Parkinson, and her deteriorating state was hard to handle when I myself wasn\u2019t in the best state of mind.<b><br/></b></p><p>I felt lost. What I had initially assumed to be post-graduation depression soon spiraled into a resonating sense of existential dread. I was unemployed and unsure about my future. I spent 20 hours a day in bed and estranged my friends. I fought to accept my newly discovered asexuality and gender identity and grieved over the fact that I hadn&rsquo;t discovered it sooner. The abuse and suffering I\u2019d experienced during my brief life felt heavier on my conscious than ever before, and I wished my life would end before it fully consumed me.<br/><br/>But then, one day, out of the blue, something strange happened: A very random acquaintance that I had not spoken to for more than two years hit me up on messenger saying, unprompted: \u201cYou should watch this show called Critical Role, you\u2019d like it.\u201d<br/><br/>It\u2019s not like I had anything else to do with my life. I hadn\u2019t touched D&amp;D in more than a decade, and since I did indeed enjoy watching people play videogames on YouTube, I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. To this day, I still can\u2019t believe I almost stopped watching after the first episode. I was having a bad day and my patience had been tried during the first combat scene. The next day, I gave it another shot, when I was in a better mood. And then I kept on watching&hellip;and kept on watching, and kept on watching&hellip; for two months straight. </p><p>Critical Role was the first thing I\u2019d see when I woke up. I\u2019d take a quick break to do human things like eating, bathing, and fixing my grandmother&rsquo;s heater, but then I\u2019d dive right back in. I told myself I wasn\u2019t allowed to watch a new episode after 2AM, but even then I sometimes couldn\u2019t resist. It was the ultimate escapist activity. I once told my grandma I was going out with friends so she wouldn\u2019t worry about me, when in reality I hid away in the garage under the apartment where I could still use the wifi and watched another episode. By the time I caught up, Vox Machina has just visited Marquet, and felt like my world was going to fall apart because I couldn\u2019t binge new content anymore. </p><p>But my world didn\u2019t fall apart. I did what any sane person would do and simply decided watch it all over again, which was oddly rewarding because I was now watching it with Dungeon Master eyes, and could see all the little tidbits of foreshadowing. \u00a0And then I watched it again\u2026but this time while recording trivia facts, because why not?<br/><br/>Needless to say, \u00a0I kept myself busy. I felt like a child again, discovering something that I wanted to explore with all of my imagination. I started drawing again, and writing again. I drew portrait Percy on the backside of an expired document: it was the first drawing I had done in almost two years. I wrote a quick little fanfiction blurbs that I didn\u2019t publish, but that I liked enough to save on a computer.</p><p>When I felt like I was running out of things to do, I did not fall into despair like I initially predicted. Instead, another strange thing happened: I started going out more. I was actually <i>excited </i>to tell my friends about this new show I was watching, even if it was foreign and bizarre to southern Italians. But then I discovered that some of my friends did know what D&amp;D was, and I told them I wanted to try being a dungeon master again. We ended up making a group and playing once a week for 7 hours a day for 5 months. It was the happiest I had ever been in a long long time. I felt like I had purpose, and something to look forward to. I told myself I\u2019d put off committing suicide until after Critical Role was over.<br/></p><p>On my plane ride back to California, I started writing a comprehensive Modern Adaptation of the Vox Machina saga as writing practice. I enjoyed exploring the character\u2019s personalities in a magicless modern setting. I found the character studies to be incredibly rewarding and a means of practicing my craft. The fact that others liked what I wrote was more than a convenient bonus: It made me realize that there were people out there who actually looked forward to reading the next chapter of something I had created. I once got a comment that was three pages long, and I almost cried. It meant that I now had something else I needed to finish before I killed myself. It wasn\u2019t just for me anymore: This was for all of those who could relate to the struggles of young adults trying to make due in a pre-dystopian reality, struggling with money, drugs, love, family, self-identity, purpose, and the evils of the powerful hellbent on exploiting the weak and the underprivileged. (I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t inspired by today\u2019s current political climate\u2026 Corporations make for fantastic \u201cdragons\u201d).<br/><br/>At first, I worried that the end of the first campaign would be the end of me, but it wasn\u2019t. By the time we said goodbye to Vox Machina, I was in grad school, and I no longer had time to think about suicide. I was too busy thinking about midterms, and the next story beat in my D&amp;D home game, and how I was going to translate the demon attack on Uriel\u2019s family in a modern setting. <br/><br/>But Critical Role and the cast did so much more for me than just keep me alive: It helped me better understand what it meant to be an independent young adult; it showed me what healthy relationships were supposed to look like; it gave me the realization that friends could be family. D&amp;D was the vessel that allowed me to meet my Queer Platonic Partner. Critical Role even taught me what \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d was, which in turn put me on the right track toward recovery (albeit after nice long crying session, because that\u2019s apparently something that happens when you find a word for something that has been haunting you for years). But Critical Role also helped me process more immediate life events, such as the death of my grandfather, with more emotional clarity. His situation paralleled Vax\u2019s in many ways: We knew it was gonna happen, but it still hurt when it did. Critical Role helped me understand that what I was feeling was normal. Even heroes cried.<br/><br/>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been working on this modern adaptation of the Vox Machina saga for two years now, because I\u2019ve never been able to stick with something for longer than six months.

I told myself I wasn\u2019t allowed to watch a new episode after 2AM, but even then I sometimes couldn\u2019t resist. It was the ultimate escapist activity. I once told my grandma I was going out with friends so she wouldn\u2019t worry about me, when in reality I hid away in the garage under the apartment where I could still use the wifi and watched another episode.

The fact that others liked what I wrote was more than a convenient bonus: It made me realize that there were people out there who actually looked forward to reading the next chapter of something I had created. I once got a comment that was three pages long, and I almost cried. It meant that I now had something else I needed to finish before I killed myself. It wasn\u2019t just for me anymore: This was for all of those who could relate to the struggles of young adults trying to make due in a pre-dystopian reality, struggling with money, drugs, love, family, self-identity, purpose, and the evils of the powerful hellbent on exploiting the weak and the underprivileged.

But Critical Role also helped me process more immediate life events, such as the death of my grandfather, with more emotional clarity.
