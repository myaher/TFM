However, they did recieve hints, particular when they discovered \u201corbs\u201d that were later reveals to be communication devices for the dragons. </p><p>I first came to realize just how early on the events of the Chroma conclave were set into motion during the writing of the pre-steam content in my Chaos Theory AU.
