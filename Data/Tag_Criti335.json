They drink tea, smoke dead-people-leaves and try out some new things. <br/></i></p><p><b>[ <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15468870\">ao3</a> ]</b></p><p>Molly doesn\u2019t\nhave a type, really. He likes all kinds of people, has as long as he remembers.\nYasha could probably tell a tale or two about Molly\u2019s varied tastes when it\ncomes to taking people to bed with him.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>One of the\nways to live life to the fullest is to connect with all sorts of people and\nMolly always found it easiest to connect with them\u2026 well. Physically. Not\nnecessarily in a sexual manner, but he likes touching people and he loves being\ntouched in return, be it in form of a hug, a tickle or bending someone over a\ntable and making them forget their own name.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>When he\nwakes up, his first thoughts vary from \u201cFucking shit\u201d and \u201cNot again\u201d to \u201cI\nreally need a hug\u201d. \u00a0 <br/></p><p>What he gets\nfirst is a loud screech, a suppressed sobbing sound and a muttered \u201cDen G\u00f6ttern\nsei Dank\u201d which he doesn\u2019t understand. But he recognizes the voices even though\nit\u2019s hard to believe that Beau could make a sobbing sound like this.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cMolly?\u201d,\nNott yelps and Molly turns his head to see where she is. Her nervous wiggling\nmakes him wonder if she wants to hug him but she stares at him with wide eyes\nand doesn\u2019t seem to find the courage to come closer.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Both Caleb\u2019s\nand Beau\u2019s eyes are blue and huge and Molly wants to complain about the rather\ncold welcome when he realizes what makes them so apprehensive. \u00a0\u00a0<i><br/></i></p><p><i>They don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really me</i>, Molly thinks. <i>They brought the body back and don\u2019t know who\u2019s living in it.\u00a0 <br/></i></p><p>He feels cold\nand stiff and everything hurts and when he opens his mouth only a broken sound\ncomes out.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cCareful\nthere, coming back is never easy\u201d, a fourth voice says. Molly doesn\u2019t recognize\nit so he turns his head and\u2026 there is a Firbolg. <br/></p><p>He has no idea who it is but\ndamn, that guy is huge. And rather pretty. Molly loves people who are just as\ncolorful as he is so this pink and turquoise giant of a man is right up his\nalleyway.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make\nsome tea, purple fella. You should just take it easy and breathe.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly turns\nhis head and looks at Beau first. She is definitely crying while simultaneously\ntrying to hide it. It doesn\u2019t work at all.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He manages\nto stretch his hand out a bit and wonders what he can do to make them realize\nthat they brought the right one back\u2014not Lucien, not Nonagon or whatever the\nguy called himself\u2014without talking.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>So he opts\nfor sticking his tongue out and throwing Caleb a wink. \u00a0Nott\u2019s\nscreech is so loud it hurts his ears and finally, finally they come to him\u2014Nott\nfirst, Caleb second and Beau third.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>She is\nstill terrible but wonderfully alive so it was all worth it, the pain, the\ndying. Beau got away so it was all <i>worth\nit</i>.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Molly will\nnever tell her that.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He wants to\nask where the others are, if they managed to save them, if Yasha is alright\u2014she\nhas to be, Yasha is so strong, but\u2026 damn, those fucking slavers were also very\nstrong. <br/></p><p>Molly hates not being able to speak. Maybe it\u2019ll come back in a few\nminutes but he feels like he should take it all one step at a time.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Nott hugs\nhim, which surprises him immensely. What surprises him even more is that Caleb\nactually touches his hair. Caleb. <i>Touches</i>.\nIt\u2019s so faint Molly almost misses it but those are definitely fingers stroking\nhis hair and then there is Beau, looking down at him with bloodshot eyes, dark\nrings under them like a physical testament of all the things she\u2019s lost.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cYou\nfucking asshole, Molly\u201d, she croaks and then without any warning she hugs him\nas well, crushes him, buries her face in the crook of his neck and actually\nstarts sobbing again.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He tries to\nlift his arm and wrap it around her and it hurts like hell but he desperately\nwants to comfort her.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cGlad to\nhave you back, friend\u201d, Caleb says quietly, his blue eyes never leaving Molly\u2019s\nface as if he\u2019s drinking him in. <br/></p><p>All well and alive.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Beau keeps\nmumbling profanities into his bloody shirt and his shoulder.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\ntake any of your stuff\u201d, Nott sniffs and touches the jewelry on his horns, \u201cbecause\nyou taught me not to steal from happy people.\u201d <br/></p><p>That\u2019s all\nshe manages before she starts sobbing as well and now Molly has his arms full\nof a goblin and an unpleasant monk. It makes him so happy he almost can\u2019t bear\nit.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cWe got the\nothers. They still need healing, so they are staying with Nila.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly has\nno idea who Nila is but a faint memory tickles his brain in which a Firbolg\nwoman tells them of Nila, the mother who left her clan to save her son. Molly\nhopes she got to save him.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Yasha is\nfree. Jester and Fjord are safe.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>And Molly\nis <i>alive</i>.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He feels\nlaughter bubble up in his chest and it hurts when it breaks free but damn, it\nfeels good.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cI made\nsome\u2014how did you call it? Dead-people-tea. It\u2019s ok, you can drink it even when\nyou\u2019re alive and I assure you it won\u2019t kill you again\u201d, the stranger says, his\nface appearing above Molly. Molly really digs his pink hair.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cThis is Clay.\nWe found him on a graveyard and he brought you back. He grows tea from dead\npeople\u201d, Nott explains, still sniffing. She sits up again and now helps Caleb\nand Beau to prop Molly up as well so he can take the teacup that is offered to\nhim.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Clay bows a\nbit after Molly took one of the cups from his hands.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cCaduceus\nClay. At your service. And you must be Mollymauk Tealeaf, the good friend of\nthese fine, slaver-killing people\u201d, Clay says and sits down facing Molly before\ntaking a content sip from his tea.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Molly\u2014despite\nwhat his last name is\u2014doesn\u2019t care that much for tea but this is delicious.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He tries to\nopen his mouth and a broken sound comes out. \u00a0Fucking\nshit.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cTake your\ntime, friend. Your voice will find its way back as well. Or. Did he talk\nbefore?\u201d, Clay wants to know. <br/></p><p>Beau snorts and wipes her face on her sleeve.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t\never stop to fucking talk. This is actually quite nice.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly\nsnorts and sticks his tongue out again. <br/></p><p>Damn it feels good to be back. This big\nass chunk of nothingness and black void really doesn\u2019t do it for him. No, he\nprefers this vibrant, terrible place above all other places.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>And this\ntime waking up, instead of dirt he had to claw himself out of, there is\nactually\u2026 well.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>His new\nfamily. Or at least parts of it. And a hot stranger who offered him dead-people-tea\nsafe to be consumed by the living.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>After two\ncups of tea Molly actually feels his limbs again and they wrap him in his coat\nand put him on a horse in front of Beau.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Caduceus trots\nalongside them, humming under his breath and stopping from time to time to look\nat a fern, flower or a tree.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cWill you\nlook at that, those little buggers don\u2019t grow in my graveyard. I\u2019ll have to\nhave a talk with the Wildmother. Aren\u2019t you just beautiful. And what about you\u2014\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\nmostly talking to himself\u201d, Beau explains while Molly watches Caduceus touch\nsome rather plain, yellow flowers he seems to find exceptionally beautiful.\nMolly thinks that Yasha will probably like him a lot.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He tries to\nuse his voice again.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cAre\u2014do we\nadopt this one?\u201d, he rasps out.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Finally.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Beau\nsnorts.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cHell if I\nknow. He turns dead people into mulch and heals, so I feel like he\u2019d be pretty\nuseful. And he wanted to leave his weird swamp. Garden. Graveyard. Whatever,\nyou\u2019ll see the place.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly\nlistens to Caduceus\u2019 proclamations. <br/></p><p>He has such a calming voice that Molly\nactually falls asleep against Beau, his head lolling back onto her shoulder. In\nhis slumber he could swear that she wraps an arm around him to hold him upright\nand maybe it feels like she presses her hand on his ribs as if to see if he\u2019s\nstill breathing.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Molly didn\u2019t\nintend to sleep for so long but when he wakes up it\u2019s dark outside and he needs\na moment to realize where he is. This is definitely a graveyard, so it might be\nthe place the others talked about.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>It smells\noverwhelmingly of all different kinds of flowers, which is the first thing Molly\nnotices. <br/></p><p>The second thing is that he is the center of a cuddle pile. His head\nrests on Yasha\u2019s shoulder\u2014Jester is curled up against the both of them. Beau\u2019s\nhead lies on Jester\u2019s soft stomach while Nott is splayed all over Jester\u2019s legs.\u00a0\n<br/></p><p>Caleb lies\na bit apart from them, but his hand is stretched out to bridge the distance and\nhis fingers lie just inches away from Molly\u2019s hand. Fjord sleeps on his side,\nquietly snoring while loosely hugging Beauregard from behind.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>This never\nhappened before but here they are, suddenly deeply connected through the trauma\nthat grabbed all of them, either in the form of loss or being lost in one way\nor the other. Molly would love to stay like this forever, he thinks. He hopes\nthat they\u2019ll keep on doing this even after the pain heals.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>As he turns\nhis head slightly his gaze locks onto a tall figure sitting on a boulder a few\nfeet away. It smells like tea and something smoky and sweet which he can\u2019t\nplace. And while Molly loves cuddling he can\u2019t bear to lie down for just a\nminute longer. His body wants to move again after lying in the dirt for so long\nso he gets up slowly before standing there beside his family, just watching\nthem sleep and snore and drool.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Damn, he\nloves them. All of them. So fucking much it actually hurts in his chest.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>His body\nstill feels as if someone put metal spikes into it but he still walks over to\nwhere Caduceus Clay drinks his tea and looks at the night sky. <br/></p><p>\u201cSo this is\nwhere you get your dead-people-tea?\u201d, Molly asks and stretches his legs, his\narms, rolls his neck and wiggles his fingers. What a wonder this body is,\nmoving around on demand, heart beating steadily in his chest. All those nerve\nendings that feel as if someone set him on fire are just a sign that he is\nwonderfully alive. \u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cOh yes.\nYou want a cup?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\nthanks. Maybe later.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly looks\nat the small pipe Caduceus holds in his other hand. The sweet and smoky smell\nseems to come directly out of there.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cWant to\ntry, purple friend?\u201d, Caduceus asks and holds out the pipe for Molly.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d, Molly wants to know and takes the pipe, inspects it and smells it again.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cOh, you\nknow. It\u2019s just a bit more dead-people-tea but for smoking, I guess. Makes\nlonely nights less lonely and sometimes it makes the flowers sing.\u201d <br/></p><p>Singing\nflowers sound as if Caduceus is talking about drugs and Molly is all for trying\nnew things, so he puts the pipe to his lips and inhales. It tastes as if\nsomeone set a field of sunflowers on fire, which is interesting enough and he\nenjoys the slight burn in his throat before he pushes the smoke out of his\nlungs and sends it up towards the sky.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Then he\nhands the pipe back to Caduceus.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cThanks for\nbringing me back\u201d, he says quietly. His voice still sounds as if he\u2019s been\nscreaming for hours.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s\nnot a big deal. Usually I\u2019m all for the natural order of things to unfold but\nyou know, your friends there told me all about you. How you only had two years\nin this borrowed body of yours. And, uh\u2014violence is natural. But deliberate\ncruelty really isn\u2019t. So I feel like the Wildmother will understand why I uh\u2014took\nsomeone back from her soil.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly\nwatches smoke escape Caduceus\u2019s mouth as he talks before the huge Firbolg hands\nthe pipe back to him.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Up in the\nsky the full moon shimmers brightly and bathes them in a pale light, making\nMolly wonder if the Moon Weaver is up there smiling down on him. He puts the\npipe to his lips again and breathes in.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you\nlived here\u2026 how long?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cOh, since\nI was born. Never been out that far before, let me tell you. It was quite the\nwild ride.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cAnd you\nlived here alone?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cNo. My\nfamily lived here with me but they\u2019re all gone now. I\u2019ve been alone for\u2014hm. Two\nseasons.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly knows\nthat there are probably more interesting topics to talk about with a Cleric who\nturns dead people into mulch and guards an ancient elven graveyard in the\nmiddle of a cursed forest. But he is still Mollymauk Tealeaf\u2014thank the gods and\nthank his friends and also Caduceus\u2014and these tealeaves he smokes at the moment\nmake his tongue looser than it usually is anyway.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cSo that\nmeans you never had sex before?\u201d <br/></p><p>Caduceus\nturns his head to look at Molly, his head cocked to the side, his eyes full of mirth.\u00a0\n<br/></p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s\nwhat it means, aside from other stuff it means as well. We never got visitors\nout here. But I have plenty of visitors now.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly chuckles\nand thinks about this for a while and the pipe passes back and forth while\nCaduceus drinks his tea and looks at the moon. Sometimes he also looks at Molly\nas if he\u2019s trying to assess the weird and colorful mystery that is Mollymauk\nTealeaf.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cDo you\nhear the flowers sing?\u201d, he asks after what seems like eternity. Molly could\nswear that the moon starts turning pink. He closes his eyes and listens and\nwell, there is definitely a weird sound in the air, almost like tiny hummingbirds\nmixed with the sound of small bells ringing through the night.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He laughs\nand opens his eyes again.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cI suppose\nI do\u201d, he says. Whatever those leaves are, they make him feel warm and heavy\nand at the same time wonderfully lightheaded. He feels as if his mind could take\nflight any second and maybe even touch the moon. The pain in his body subsides.\u00a0\n<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you\nalso never kissed anyone.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cWould you\nwant to kiss anyone?\u201d <br/></p><p>Caduceus\nlooks at him and grins lazily.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cDunno.\nMaybe kissing is terrible. I wouldn\u2019t know either way, Mollymauk Tealeaf.\u201d <br/></p><p>Molly\nshrugs and nods. </p><p>\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. Wanna find out if kissing is terrible?\u201d\u00a0Caduceus\nputs his teacup aside and turns until he sits cross legged on top of the\nboulder, his tall silhouette framed by moonlight.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> like kissing?\u201d, Caduceus wants to\nknow. Molly turns to face him the exact same way and takes one last gulp of\nsmoke before putting the pipe aside.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cOh yes. I\nlike almost everything that involves touching. And exchanging bodily fluids,\nfor that matter. Well\u2014ah, never mind.\u201d <br/></p><p>Caduceus\ncocks one of his pink eyebrows but doesn\u2019t answer, just looks at Molly.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He just\nreturned from the grave the second time so who the hell would Molly be to\nrefuse a hot guy his first kiss. He wants to grab life by the collar and yank\nit in, take as much as he can because tomorrow he might face a foe who is\nstronger. And then he might die yet again.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>So living\nlife to the fullest in this very moment seems to involve kissing pretty\nstrangers and smoking flowers while the moon smiles down on him.\u00a0Molly leans\nforward, tilts his head and carefully presses his lips to Caduceus\u2019.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>He\u2019s warm\nto the touch and tastes like tea and burning sunflowers. Molly cups his cheeks\nand presses closer, nibs at Caduceus\u2019 bottom lip and then pulls back a bit.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cThat was\nquite nice\u201d, Caduceus says. Molly chuckles.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cWanna try\nwith tongue?\u201d <br/></p><p>Caduceus\ngrins at him.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u201cWell, what\ncan I say. The dead rise, the flowers are singing\u2026 It seems to be an\nappropriate night to try all sorts of things, Mollymauk Tealeaf.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p></div>",

            "comment": "<p><h2>do you hear the flowers sing</h2><div><p>\n<i>Molly is resurrected by Caduceus Clay. They drink tea, smoke dead-people-leaves and try out some new things. <br></i></p><p><b>[ <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15468870\">ao3</a> ]</b></p><p>Molly doesn\u2019t\nhave a type, really. He likes all kinds of people, has as long as he remembers.\nYasha could probably tell a tale or two about Molly\u2019s varied tastes when it\ncomes to taking people to bed with him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>One of the\nways to live life to the fullest is to connect with all sorts of people and\nMolly always found it easiest to connect with them\u2026 well. Physically. Not\nnecessarily in a sexual manner, but he likes touching people and he loves being\ntouched in return, be it in form of a hug, a tickle or bending someone over a\ntable and making them forget their own name.\u00a0 <br></p><p>When he\nwakes up, his first thoughts vary from \u201cFucking shit\u201d and \u201cNot again\u201d to \u201cI\nreally need a hug\u201d. \u00a0 <br></p><p>What he gets\nfirst is a loud screech, a suppressed sobbing sound and a muttered \u201cDen G\u00f6ttern\nsei Dank\u201d which he doesn\u2019t understand. But he recognizes the voices even though\nit\u2019s hard to believe that Beau could make a sobbing sound like this.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cMolly?\u201d,\nNott yelps and Molly turns his head to see where she is. Her nervous wiggling\nmakes him wonder if she wants to hug him but she stares at him with wide eyes\nand doesn\u2019t seem to find the courage to come closer.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Both Caleb\u2019s\nand Beau\u2019s eyes are blue and huge and Molly wants to complain about the rather\ncold welcome when he realizes what makes them so apprehensive. \u00a0\u00a0<i><br></i></p><p><i>They don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really me</i>, Molly thinks. <i>They brought the body back and don\u2019t know who\u2019s living in it.\u00a0 <br></i></p><p>He feels cold\nand stiff and everything hurts and when he opens his mouth only a broken sound\ncomes out.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cCareful\nthere, coming back is never easy\u201d, a fourth voice says. Molly doesn\u2019t recognize\nit so he turns his head and\u2026 there is a Firbolg. <br></p><p>He has no idea who it is but\ndamn, that guy is huge. And rather pretty. Molly loves people who are just as\ncolorful as he is so this pink and turquoise giant of a man is right up his\nalleyway.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make\nsome tea, purple fella. You should just take it easy and breathe.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly turns\nhis head and looks at Beau first. She is definitely crying while simultaneously\ntrying to hide it. It doesn\u2019t work at all.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He manages\nto stretch his hand out a bit and wonders what he can do to make them realize\nthat they brought the right one back\u2014not Lucien, not Nonagon or whatever the\nguy called himself\u2014without talking.\u00a0 <br></p><p>So he opts\nfor sticking his tongue out and throwing Caleb a wink. \u00a0Nott\u2019s\nscreech is so loud it hurts his ears and finally, finally they come to him\u2014Nott\nfirst, Caleb second and Beau third.\u00a0 <br></p><p>She is\nstill terrible but wonderfully alive so it was all worth it, the pain, the\ndying. Beau got away so it was all <i>worth\nit</i>.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Molly will\nnever tell her that.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He wants to\nask where the others are, if they managed to save them, if Yasha is alright\u2014she\nhas to be, Yasha is so strong, but\u2026 damn, those fucking slavers were also very\nstrong. <br></p><p>Molly hates not being able to speak. Maybe it\u2019ll come back in a few\nminutes but he feels like he should take it all one step at a time.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Nott hugs\nhim, which surprises him immensely. What surprises him even more is that Caleb\nactually touches his hair. Caleb. <i>Touches</i>.\nIt\u2019s so faint Molly almost misses it but those are definitely fingers stroking\nhis hair and then there is Beau, looking down at him with bloodshot eyes, dark\nrings under them like a physical testament of all the things she\u2019s lost.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nfucking asshole, Molly\u201d, she croaks and then without any warning she hugs him\nas well, crushes him, buries her face in the crook of his neck and actually\nstarts sobbing again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He tries to\nlift his arm and wrap it around her and it hurts like hell but he desperately\nwants to comfort her.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cGlad to\nhave you back, friend\u201d, Caleb says quietly, his blue eyes never leaving Molly\u2019s\nface as if he\u2019s drinking him in. <br></p><p>All well and alive.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Beau keeps\nmumbling profanities into his bloody shirt and his shoulder.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\ntake any of your stuff\u201d, Nott sniffs and touches the jewelry on his horns, \u201cbecause\nyou taught me not to steal from happy people.\u201d <br></p><p>That\u2019s all\nshe manages before she starts sobbing as well and now Molly has his arms full\nof a goblin and an unpleasant monk. It makes him so happy he almost can\u2019t bear\nit.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWe got the\nothers. They still need healing, so they are staying with Nila.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly has\nno idea who Nila is but a faint memory tickles his brain in which a Firbolg\nwoman tells them of Nila, the mother who left her clan to save her son. Molly\nhopes she got to save him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Yasha is\nfree. Jester and Fjord are safe.\u00a0 <br></p><p>And Molly\nis <i>alive</i>.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He feels\nlaughter bubble up in his chest and it hurts when it breaks free but damn, it\nfeels good.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI made\nsome\u2014how did you call it? Dead-people-tea. It\u2019s ok, you can drink it even when\nyou\u2019re alive and I assure you it won\u2019t kill you again\u201d, the stranger says, his\nface appearing above Molly. Molly really digs his pink hair.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cThis is Clay.\nWe found him on a graveyard and he brought you back. He grows tea from dead\npeople\u201d, Nott explains, still sniffing. She sits up again and now helps Caleb\nand Beau to prop Molly up as well so he can take the teacup that is offered to\nhim.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Clay bows a\nbit after Molly took one of the cups from his hands.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cCaduceus\nClay. At your service. And you must be Mollymauk Tealeaf, the good friend of\nthese fine, slaver-killing people\u201d, Clay says and sits down facing Molly before\ntaking a content sip from his tea.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Molly\u2014despite\nwhat his last name is\u2014doesn\u2019t care that much for tea but this is delicious.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He tries to\nopen his mouth and a broken sound comes out. \u00a0Fucking\nshit.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cTake your\ntime, friend. Your voice will find its way back as well. Or. Did he talk\nbefore?\u201d, Clay wants to know. <br></p><p>Beau snorts and wipes her face on her sleeve.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t\never stop to fucking talk. This is actually quite nice.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nsnorts and sticks his tongue out again. <br></p><p>Damn it feels good to be back. This big\nass chunk of nothingness and black void really doesn\u2019t do it for him. No, he\nprefers this vibrant, terrible place above all other places.\u00a0 <br></p><p>And this\ntime waking up, instead of dirt he had to claw himself out of, there is\nactually\u2026 well.\u00a0 <br></p><p>His new\nfamily.

And a hot stranger who offered him dead-people-tea\nsafe to be consumed by the living.\u00a0 <br></p><p>After two\ncups of tea Molly actually feels his limbs again and they wrap him in his coat\nand put him on a horse in front of Beau.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Caduceus trots\nalongside them, humming under his breath and stopping from time to time to look\nat a fern, flower or a tree.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWill you\nlook at that, those little buggers don\u2019t grow in my graveyard. I\u2019ll have to\nhave a talk with the Wildmother. Aren\u2019t you just beautiful. And what about you\u2014\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\nmostly talking to himself\u201d, Beau explains while Molly watches Caduceus touch\nsome rather plain, yellow flowers he seems to find exceptionally beautiful.\nMolly thinks that Yasha will probably like him a lot.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He tries to\nuse his voice again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cAre\u2014do we\nadopt this one?\u201d, he rasps out.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Finally.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Beau\nsnorts.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cHell if I\nknow. He turns dead people into mulch and heals, so I feel like he\u2019d be pretty\nuseful. And he wanted to leave his weird swamp. Garden. Graveyard. Whatever,\nyou\u2019ll see the place.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nlistens to Caduceus\u2019 proclamations. <br></p><p>He has such a calming voice that Molly\nactually falls asleep against Beau, his head lolling back onto her shoulder. In\nhis slumber he could swear that she wraps an arm around him to hold him upright\nand maybe it feels like she presses her hand on his ribs as if to see if he\u2019s\nstill breathing.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Molly didn\u2019t\nintend to sleep for so long but when he wakes up it\u2019s dark outside and he needs\na moment to realize where he is.

Makes\nlonely nights less lonely and sometimes it makes the flowers sing.\u201d <br></p><p>Singing\nflowers sound as if Caduceus is talking about drugs and Molly is all for trying\nnew things, so he puts the pipe to his lips and inhales. It tastes as if\nsomeone set a field of sunflowers on fire, which is interesting enough and he\nenjoys the slight burn in his throat before he pushes the smoke out of his\nlungs and sends it up towards the sky.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Then he\nhands the pipe back to Caduceus.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cThanks for\nbringing me back\u201d, he says quietly. His voice still sounds as if he\u2019s been\nscreaming for hours.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s\nnot a big deal. Usually I\u2019m all for the natural order of things to unfold but\nyou know, your friends there told me all about you. How you only had two years\nin this borrowed body of yours. And, uh\u2014violence is natural. But deliberate\ncruelty really isn\u2019t. So I feel like the Wildmother will understand why I uh\u2014took\nsomeone back from her soil.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nwatches smoke escape Caduceus\u2019s mouth as he talks before the huge Firbolg hands\nthe pipe back to him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Up in the\nsky the full moon shimmers brightly and bathes them in a pale light, making\nMolly wonder if the Moon Weaver is up there smiling down on him. He puts the\npipe to his lips again and breathes in.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you\nlived here\u2026 how long?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOh, since\nI was born. Never been out that far before, let me tell you. It was quite the\nwild ride.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cAnd you\nlived here alone?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cNo. My\nfamily lived here with me but they\u2019re all gone now. I\u2019ve been alone for\u2014hm. Two\nseasons.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly knows\nthat there are probably more interesting topics to talk about with a Cleric who\nturns dead people into mulch and guards an ancient elven graveyard in the\nmiddle of a cursed forest. But he is still Mollymauk Tealeaf\u2014thank the gods and\nthank his friends and also Caduceus\u2014and these tealeaves he smokes at the moment\nmake his tongue looser than it usually is anyway.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cSo that\nmeans you never had sex before?\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\nturns his head to look at Molly, his head cocked to the side, his eyes full of mirth.\u00a0\n<br></p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s\nwhat it means, aside from other stuff it means as well. We never got visitors\nout here. But I have plenty of visitors now.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly chuckles\nand thinks about this for a while and the pipe passes back and forth while\nCaduceus drinks his tea and looks at the moon. Sometimes he also looks at Molly\nas if he\u2019s trying to assess the weird and colorful mystery that is Mollymauk\nTealeaf.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDo you\nhear the flowers sing?\u201d, he asks after what seems like eternity. Molly could\nswear that the moon starts turning pink. He closes his eyes and listens and\nwell, there is definitely a weird sound in the air, almost like tiny hummingbirds\nmixed with the sound of small bells ringing through the night.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He laughs\nand opens his eyes again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI suppose\nI do\u201d, he says. Whatever those leaves are, they make him feel warm and heavy\nand at the same time wonderfully lightheaded. He feels as if his mind could take\nflight any second and maybe even touch the moon. The pain in his body subsides.\u00a0\n<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\nalso never kissed anyone.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cWould you\nwant to kiss anyone?\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\nlooks at him and grins lazily.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDunno.\nMaybe kissing is terrible. I wouldn\u2019t know either way, Mollymauk Tealeaf.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nshrugs and nods. </p><p>\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. Wanna find out if kissing is terrible?\u201d\u00a0Caduceus\nputs his teacup aside and turns until he sits cross legged on top of the\nboulder, his tall silhouette framed by moonlight.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> like kissing?\u201d, Caduceus wants to\nknow. Molly turns to face him the exact same way and takes one last gulp of\nsmoke before putting the pipe aside.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cOh yes. I\nlike almost everything that involves touching. And exchanging bodily fluids,\nfor that matter. Well\u2014ah, never mind.\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\ncocks one of his pink eyebrows but doesn\u2019t answer, just looks at Molly.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He just\nreturned from the grave the second time so who the hell would Molly be to\nrefuse a hot guy his first kiss. He wants to grab life by the collar and yank\nit in, take as much as he can because tomorrow he might face a foe who is\nstronger. And then he might die yet again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>So living\nlife to the fullest in this very moment seems to involve kissing pretty\nstrangers and smoking flowers while the moon smiles down on him.\u00a0Molly leans\nforward, tilts his head and carefully presses his lips to Caduceus\u2019.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He\u2019s warm\nto the touch and tastes like tea and burning sunflowers. Molly cups his cheeks\nand presses closer, nibs at Caduceus\u2019 bottom lip and then pulls back a bit.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cThat was\nquite nice\u201d, Caduceus says. Molly chuckles.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWanna try\nwith tongue?\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\ngrins at him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWell, what\ncan I say. The dead rise, the flowers are singing\u2026 It seems to be an\nappropriate night to try all sorts of things, Mollymauk Tealeaf.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p></div></p>",

They drink tea, smoke dead-people-leaves and try out some new things. <br></i></p><p><b>[ <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15468870\">ao3</a> ]</b></p><p>Molly doesn\u2019t\nhave a type, really. He likes all kinds of people, has as long as he remembers.\nYasha could probably tell a tale or two about Molly\u2019s varied tastes when it\ncomes to taking people to bed with him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>One of the\nways to live life to the fullest is to connect with all sorts of people and\nMolly always found it easiest to connect with them\u2026 well. Physically. Not\nnecessarily in a sexual manner, but he likes touching people and he loves being\ntouched in return, be it in form of a hug, a tickle or bending someone over a\ntable and making them forget their own name.\u00a0 <br></p><p>When he\nwakes up, his first thoughts vary from \u201cFucking shit\u201d and \u201cNot again\u201d to \u201cI\nreally need a hug\u201d. \u00a0 <br></p><p>What he gets\nfirst is a loud screech, a suppressed sobbing sound and a muttered \u201cDen G\u00f6ttern\nsei Dank\u201d which he doesn\u2019t understand. But he recognizes the voices even though\nit\u2019s hard to believe that Beau could make a sobbing sound like this.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cMolly?\u201d,\nNott yelps and Molly turns his head to see where she is. Her nervous wiggling\nmakes him wonder if she wants to hug him but she stares at him with wide eyes\nand doesn\u2019t seem to find the courage to come closer.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Both Caleb\u2019s\nand Beau\u2019s eyes are blue and huge and Molly wants to complain about the rather\ncold welcome when he realizes what makes them so apprehensive. \u00a0\u00a0<i><br></i></p><p><i>They don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really me</i>, Molly thinks. <i>They brought the body back and don\u2019t know who\u2019s living in it.\u00a0 <br></i></p><p>He feels cold\nand stiff and everything hurts and when he opens his mouth only a broken sound\ncomes out.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cCareful\nthere, coming back is never easy\u201d, a fourth voice says. Molly doesn\u2019t recognize\nit so he turns his head and\u2026 there is a Firbolg. <br></p><p>He has no idea who it is but\ndamn, that guy is huge. And rather pretty. Molly loves people who are just as\ncolorful as he is so this pink and turquoise giant of a man is right up his\nalleyway.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make\nsome tea, purple fella. You should just take it easy and breathe.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly turns\nhis head and looks at Beau first. She is definitely crying while simultaneously\ntrying to hide it. It doesn\u2019t work at all.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He manages\nto stretch his hand out a bit and wonders what he can do to make them realize\nthat they brought the right one back\u2014not Lucien, not Nonagon or whatever the\nguy called himself\u2014without talking.\u00a0 <br></p><p>So he opts\nfor sticking his tongue out and throwing Caleb a wink. \u00a0Nott\u2019s\nscreech is so loud it hurts his ears and finally, finally they come to him\u2014Nott\nfirst, Caleb second and Beau third.\u00a0 <br></p><p>She is\nstill terrible but wonderfully alive so it was all worth it, the pain, the\ndying. Beau got away so it was all <i>worth\nit</i>.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Molly will\nnever tell her that.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He wants to\nask where the others are, if they managed to save them, if Yasha is alright\u2014she\nhas to be, Yasha is so strong, but\u2026 damn, those fucking slavers were also very\nstrong. <br></p><p>Molly hates not being able to speak. Maybe it\u2019ll come back in a few\nminutes but he feels like he should take it all one step at a time.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Nott hugs\nhim, which surprises him immensely. What surprises him even more is that Caleb\nactually touches his hair. Caleb. <i>Touches</i>.\nIt\u2019s so faint Molly almost misses it but those are definitely fingers stroking\nhis hair and then there is Beau, looking down at him with bloodshot eyes, dark\nrings under them like a physical testament of all the things she\u2019s lost.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cYou\nfucking asshole, Molly\u201d, she croaks and then without any warning she hugs him\nas well, crushes him, buries her face in the crook of his neck and actually\nstarts sobbing again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He tries to\nlift his arm and wrap it around her and it hurts like hell but he desperately\nwants to comfort her.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cGlad to\nhave you back, friend\u201d, Caleb says quietly, his blue eyes never leaving Molly\u2019s\nface as if he\u2019s drinking him in. <br></p><p>All well and alive.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Beau keeps\nmumbling profanities into his bloody shirt and his shoulder.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\ntake any of your stuff\u201d, Nott sniffs and touches the jewelry on his horns, \u201cbecause\nyou taught me not to steal from happy people.\u201d <br></p><p>That\u2019s all\nshe manages before she starts sobbing as well and now Molly has his arms full\nof a goblin and an unpleasant monk. It makes him so happy he almost can\u2019t bear\nit.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWe got the\nothers. They still need healing, so they are staying with Nila.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly has\nno idea who Nila is but a faint memory tickles his brain in which a Firbolg\nwoman tells them of Nila, the mother who left her clan to save her son. Molly\nhopes she got to save him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Yasha is\nfree. Jester and Fjord are safe.\u00a0 <br></p><p>And Molly\nis <i>alive</i>.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He feels\nlaughter bubble up in his chest and it hurts when it breaks free but damn, it\nfeels good.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI made\nsome\u2014how did you call it? Dead-people-tea. It\u2019s ok, you can drink it even when\nyou\u2019re alive and I assure you it won\u2019t kill you again\u201d, the stranger says, his\nface appearing above Molly. Molly really digs his pink hair.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cThis is Clay.\nWe found him on a graveyard and he brought you back. He grows tea from dead\npeople\u201d, Nott explains, still sniffing. She sits up again and now helps Caleb\nand Beau to prop Molly up as well so he can take the teacup that is offered to\nhim.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Clay bows a\nbit after Molly took one of the cups from his hands.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cCaduceus\nClay. At your service. And you must be Mollymauk Tealeaf, the good friend of\nthese fine, slaver-killing people\u201d, Clay says and sits down facing Molly before\ntaking a content sip from his tea.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Molly\u2014despite\nwhat his last name is\u2014doesn\u2019t care that much for tea but this is delicious.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He tries to\nopen his mouth and a broken sound comes out. \u00a0Fucking\nshit.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cTake your\ntime, friend. Your voice will find its way back as well. Or. Did he talk\nbefore?\u201d, Clay wants to know. <br></p><p>Beau snorts and wipes her face on her sleeve.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t\never stop to fucking talk. This is actually quite nice.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nsnorts and sticks his tongue out again. <br></p><p>Damn it feels good to be back. This big\nass chunk of nothingness and black void really doesn\u2019t do it for him. No, he\nprefers this vibrant, terrible place above all other places.\u00a0 <br></p><p>And this\ntime waking up, instead of dirt he had to claw himself out of, there is\nactually\u2026 well.\u00a0 <br></p><p>His new\nfamily. Or at least parts of it. And a hot stranger who offered him dead-people-tea\nsafe to be consumed by the living.\u00a0 <br></p><p>After two\ncups of tea Molly actually feels his limbs again and they wrap him in his coat\nand put him on a horse in front of Beau.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Caduceus trots\nalongside them, humming under his breath and stopping from time to time to look\nat a fern, flower or a tree.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWill you\nlook at that, those little buggers don\u2019t grow in my graveyard. I\u2019ll have to\nhave a talk with the Wildmother. Aren\u2019t you just beautiful. And what about you\u2014\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\nmostly talking to himself\u201d, Beau explains while Molly watches Caduceus touch\nsome rather plain, yellow flowers he seems to find exceptionally beautiful.\nMolly thinks that Yasha will probably like him a lot.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He tries to\nuse his voice again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cAre\u2014do we\nadopt this one?\u201d, he rasps out.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Finally.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Beau\nsnorts.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cHell if I\nknow. He turns dead people into mulch and heals, so I feel like he\u2019d be pretty\nuseful. And he wanted to leave his weird swamp. Garden. Graveyard. Whatever,\nyou\u2019ll see the place.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nlistens to Caduceus\u2019 proclamations. <br></p><p>He has such a calming voice that Molly\nactually falls asleep against Beau, his head lolling back onto her shoulder. In\nhis slumber he could swear that she wraps an arm around him to hold him upright\nand maybe it feels like she presses her hand on his ribs as if to see if he\u2019s\nstill breathing.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Molly didn\u2019t\nintend to sleep for so long but when he wakes up it\u2019s dark outside and he needs\na moment to realize where he is. This is definitely a graveyard, so it might be\nthe place the others talked about.\u00a0 <br></p><p>It smells\noverwhelmingly of all different kinds of flowers, which is the first thing Molly\nnotices. <br></p><p>The second thing is that he is the center of a cuddle pile. His head\nrests on Yasha\u2019s shoulder\u2014Jester is curled up against the both of them. Beau\u2019s\nhead lies on Jester\u2019s soft stomach while Nott is splayed all over Jester\u2019s legs.\u00a0\n<br></p><p>Caleb lies\na bit apart from them, but his hand is stretched out to bridge the distance and\nhis fingers lie just inches away from Molly\u2019s hand. Fjord sleeps on his side,\nquietly snoring while loosely hugging Beauregard from behind.\u00a0 <br></p><p>This never\nhappened before but here they are, suddenly deeply connected through the trauma\nthat grabbed all of them, either in the form of loss or being lost in one way\nor the other. Molly would love to stay like this forever, he thinks. He hopes\nthat they\u2019ll keep on doing this even after the pain heals.\u00a0 <br></p><p>As he turns\nhis head slightly his gaze locks onto a tall figure sitting on a boulder a few\nfeet away. It smells like tea and something smoky and sweet which he can\u2019t\nplace. And while Molly loves cuddling he can\u2019t bear to lie down for just a\nminute longer. His body wants to move again after lying in the dirt for so long\nso he gets up slowly before standing there beside his family, just watching\nthem sleep and snore and drool.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Damn, he\nloves them. All of them. So fucking much it actually hurts in his chest.\u00a0 <br></p><p>His body\nstill feels as if someone put metal spikes into it but he still walks over to\nwhere Caduceus Clay drinks his tea and looks at the night sky. <br></p><p>\u201cSo this is\nwhere you get your dead-people-tea?\u201d, Molly asks and stretches his legs, his\narms, rolls his neck and wiggles his fingers. What a wonder this body is,\nmoving around on demand, heart beating steadily in his chest. All those nerve\nendings that feel as if someone set him on fire are just a sign that he is\nwonderfully alive. \u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cOh yes.\nYou want a cup?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nthanks. Maybe later.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly looks\nat the small pipe Caduceus holds in his other hand. The sweet and smoky smell\nseems to come directly out of there.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWant to\ntry, purple friend?\u201d, Caduceus asks and holds out the pipe for Molly.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d, Molly wants to know and takes the pipe, inspects it and smells it again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cOh, you\nknow. It\u2019s just a bit more dead-people-tea but for smoking, I guess. Makes\nlonely nights less lonely and sometimes it makes the flowers sing.\u201d <br></p><p>Singing\nflowers sound as if Caduceus is talking about drugs and Molly is all for trying\nnew things, so he puts the pipe to his lips and inhales. It tastes as if\nsomeone set a field of sunflowers on fire, which is interesting enough and he\nenjoys the slight burn in his throat before he pushes the smoke out of his\nlungs and sends it up towards the sky.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Then he\nhands the pipe back to Caduceus.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cThanks for\nbringing me back\u201d, he says quietly. His voice still sounds as if he\u2019s been\nscreaming for hours.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s\nnot a big deal. Usually I\u2019m all for the natural order of things to unfold but\nyou know, your friends there told me all about you. How you only had two years\nin this borrowed body of yours. And, uh\u2014violence is natural. But deliberate\ncruelty really isn\u2019t. So I feel like the Wildmother will understand why I uh\u2014took\nsomeone back from her soil.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nwatches smoke escape Caduceus\u2019s mouth as he talks before the huge Firbolg hands\nthe pipe back to him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Up in the\nsky the full moon shimmers brightly and bathes them in a pale light, making\nMolly wonder if the Moon Weaver is up there smiling down on him.

Never been out that far before, let me tell you. It was quite the\nwild ride.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cAnd you\nlived here alone?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cNo. My\nfamily lived here with me but they\u2019re all gone now. I\u2019ve been alone for\u2014hm. Two\nseasons.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly knows\nthat there are probably more interesting topics to talk about with a Cleric who\nturns dead people into mulch and guards an ancient elven graveyard in the\nmiddle of a cursed forest. But he is still Mollymauk Tealeaf\u2014thank the gods and\nthank his friends and also Caduceus\u2014and these tealeaves he smokes at the moment\nmake his tongue looser than it usually is anyway.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cSo that\nmeans you never had sex before?\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\nturns his head to look at Molly, his head cocked to the side, his eyes full of mirth.\u00a0\n<br></p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s\nwhat it means, aside from other stuff it means as well. We never got visitors\nout here. But I have plenty of visitors now.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly chuckles\nand thinks about this for a while and the pipe passes back and forth while\nCaduceus drinks his tea and looks at the moon. Sometimes he also looks at Molly\nas if he\u2019s trying to assess the weird and colorful mystery that is Mollymauk\nTealeaf.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDo you\nhear the flowers sing?\u201d, he asks after what seems like eternity. Molly could\nswear that the moon starts turning pink. He closes his eyes and listens and\nwell, there is definitely a weird sound in the air, almost like tiny hummingbirds\nmixed with the sound of small bells ringing through the night.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He laughs\nand opens his eyes again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cI suppose\nI do\u201d, he says. Whatever those leaves are, they make him feel warm and heavy\nand at the same time wonderfully lightheaded. He feels as if his mind could take\nflight any second and maybe even touch the moon. The pain in his body subsides.\u00a0\n<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\nalso never kissed anyone.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cWould you\nwant to kiss anyone?\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\nlooks at him and grins lazily.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDunno.\nMaybe kissing is terrible. I wouldn\u2019t know either way, Mollymauk Tealeaf.\u201d <br></p><p>Molly\nshrugs and nods. </p><p>\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. Wanna find out if kissing is terrible?\u201d\u00a0Caduceus\nputs his teacup aside and turns until he sits cross legged on top of the\nboulder, his tall silhouette framed by moonlight.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> like kissing?\u201d, Caduceus wants to\nknow. Molly turns to face him the exact same way and takes one last gulp of\nsmoke before putting the pipe aside.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cOh yes. I\nlike almost everything that involves touching. And exchanging bodily fluids,\nfor that matter. Well\u2014ah, never mind.\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\ncocks one of his pink eyebrows but doesn\u2019t answer, just looks at Molly.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He just\nreturned from the grave the second time so who the hell would Molly be to\nrefuse a hot guy his first kiss. He wants to grab life by the collar and yank\nit in, take as much as he can because tomorrow he might face a foe who is\nstronger. And then he might die yet again.\u00a0 <br></p><p>So living\nlife to the fullest in this very moment seems to involve kissing pretty\nstrangers and smoking flowers while the moon smiles down on him.\u00a0Molly leans\nforward, tilts his head and carefully presses his lips to Caduceus\u2019.\u00a0 <br></p><p>He\u2019s warm\nto the touch and tastes like tea and burning sunflowers. Molly cups his cheeks\nand presses closer, nibs at Caduceus\u2019 bottom lip and then pulls back a bit.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cThat was\nquite nice\u201d, Caduceus says. Molly chuckles.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWanna try\nwith tongue?\u201d <br></p><p>Caduceus\ngrins at him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cWell, what\ncan I say.

                "content": "<p><h2>do you hear the flowers sing</h2><p>\n<i>Molly is resurrected by Caduceus Clay. They drink tea, smoke dead-people-leaves and try out some new things. <br /></i></p><p><b>[ <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15468870\">ao3</a> ]</b></p><p>Molly doesn&rsquo;t\nhave a type, really. He likes all kinds of people, has as long as he remembers.\nYasha could probably tell a tale or two about Molly&rsquo;s varied tastes when it\ncomes to taking people to bed with him.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>One of the\nways to live life to the fullest is to connect with all sorts of people and\nMolly always found it easiest to connect with them&hellip; well. Physically. Not\nnecessarily in a sexual manner, but he likes touching people and he loves being\ntouched in return, be it in form of a hug, a tickle or bending someone over a\ntable and making them forget their own name.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>When he\nwakes up, his first thoughts vary from &ldquo;Fucking shit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not again&rdquo; to &ldquo;I\nreally need a hug&rdquo;. &nbsp; <br /></p><p>What he gets\nfirst is a loud screech, a suppressed sobbing sound and a muttered &ldquo;Den G&ouml;ttern\nsei Dank&rdquo; which he doesn&rsquo;t understand. But he recognizes the voices even though\nit&rsquo;s hard to believe that Beau could make a sobbing sound like this.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Molly?&rdquo;,\nNott yelps and Molly turns his head to see where she is. Her nervous wiggling\nmakes him wonder if she wants to hug him but she stares at him with wide eyes\nand doesn&rsquo;t seem to find the courage to come closer.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Both Caleb&rsquo;s\nand Beau&rsquo;s eyes are blue and huge and Molly wants to complain about the rather\ncold welcome when he realizes what makes them so apprehensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;<i><br /></i></p><p><i>They don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s really me</i>, Molly thinks. <i>They brought the body back and don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s living in it.&nbsp; <br /></i></p><p>He feels cold\nand stiff and everything hurts and when he opens his mouth only a broken sound\ncomes out.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Careful\nthere, coming back is never easy&rdquo;, a fourth voice says. Molly doesn&rsquo;t recognize\nit so he turns his head and&hellip; there is a Firbolg. <br /></p><p>He has no idea who it is but\ndamn, that guy is huge. And rather pretty. Molly loves people who are just as\ncolorful as he is so this pink and turquoise giant of a man is right up his\nalleyway.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make\nsome tea, purple fella. You should just take it easy and breathe.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly turns\nhis head and looks at Beau first. She is definitely crying while simultaneously\ntrying to hide it. It doesn&rsquo;t work at all.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>He manages\nto stretch his hand out a bit and wonders what he can do to make them realize\nthat they brought the right one back&mdash;not Lucien, not Nonagon or whatever the\nguy called himself&mdash;without talking.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>So he opts\nfor sticking his tongue out and throwing Caleb a wink. &nbsp;Nott&rsquo;s\nscreech is so loud it hurts his ears and finally, finally they come to him&mdash;Nott\nfirst, Caleb second and Beau third.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>She is\nstill terrible but wonderfully alive so it was all worth it, the pain, the\ndying. Beau got away so it was all <i>worth\nit</i>.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Molly will\nnever tell her that.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>He wants to\nask where the others are, if they managed to save them, if Yasha is alright&mdash;she\nhas to be, Yasha is so strong, but&hellip; damn, those fucking slavers were also very\nstrong. <br /></p><p>Molly hates not being able to speak. Maybe it&rsquo;ll come back in a few\nminutes but he feels like he should take it all one step at a time.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Nott hugs\nhim, which surprises him immensely. What surprises him even more is that Caleb\nactually touches his hair. Caleb. <i>Touches</i>.\nIt&rsquo;s so faint Molly almost misses it but those are definitely fingers stroking\nhis hair and then there is Beau, looking down at him with bloodshot eyes, dark\nrings under them like a physical testament of all the things she&rsquo;s lost.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You\nfucking asshole, Molly&rdquo;, she croaks and then without any warning she hugs him\nas well, crushes him, buries her face in the crook of his neck and actually\nstarts sobbing again.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>He tries to\nlift his arm and wrap it around her and it hurts like hell but he desperately\nwants to comfort her.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Glad to\nhave you back, friend&rdquo;, Caleb says quietly, his blue eyes never leaving Molly&rsquo;s\nface as if he&rsquo;s drinking him in. <br /></p><p>All well and alive.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Beau keeps\nmumbling profanities into his bloody shirt and his shoulder.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t\ntake any of your stuff&rdquo;, Nott sniffs and touches the jewelry on his horns, &ldquo;because\nyou taught me not to steal from happy people.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>That&rsquo;s all\nshe manages before she starts sobbing as well and now Molly has his arms full\nof a goblin and an unpleasant monk. It makes him so happy he almost can&rsquo;t bear\nit.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;We got the\nothers. They still need healing, so they are staying with Nila.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly has\nno idea who Nila is but a faint memory tickles his brain in which a Firbolg\nwoman tells them of Nila, the mother who left her clan to save her son. Molly\nhopes she got to save him.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Yasha is\nfree. Jester and Fjord are safe.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>And Molly\nis <i>alive</i>.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>He feels\nlaughter bubble up in his chest and it hurts when it breaks free but damn, it\nfeels good.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I made\nsome&mdash;how did you call it? Dead-people-tea. It&rsquo;s ok, you can drink it even when\nyou&rsquo;re alive and I assure you it won&rsquo;t kill you again&rdquo;, the stranger says, his\nface appearing above Molly. Molly really digs his pink hair.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;This is Clay.\nWe found him on a graveyard and he brought you back. He grows tea from dead\npeople&rdquo;, Nott explains, still sniffing. She sits up again and now helps Caleb\nand Beau to prop Molly up as well so he can take the teacup that is offered to\nhim.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Clay bows a\nbit after Molly took one of the cups from his hands.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Caduceus\nClay. At your service. And you must be Mollymauk Tealeaf, the good friend of\nthese fine, slaver-killing people&rdquo;, Clay says and sits down facing Molly before\ntaking a content sip from his tea.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Molly&mdash;despite\nwhat his last name is&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t care that much for tea but this is delicious.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>He tries to\nopen his mouth and a broken sound comes out. &nbsp;Fucking\nshit.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Take your\ntime, friend. Your voice will find its way back as well. Or. Did he talk\nbefore?&rdquo;, Clay wants to know. <br /></p><p>Beau snorts and wipes her face on her sleeve.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t\never stop to fucking talk. This is actually quite nice.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly\nsnorts and sticks his tongue out again. <br /></p><p>Damn it feels good to be back. This big\nass chunk of nothingness and black void really doesn&rsquo;t do it for him. No, he\nprefers this vibrant, terrible place above all other places.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>And this\ntime waking up, instead of dirt he had to claw himself out of, there is\nactually&hellip; well.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>His new\nfamily. Or at least parts of it. And a hot stranger who offered him dead-people-tea\nsafe to be consumed by the living.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>After two\ncups of tea Molly actually feels his limbs again and they wrap him in his coat\nand put him on a horse in front of Beau.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Caduceus trots\nalongside them, humming under his breath and stopping from time to time to look\nat a fern, flower or a tree.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Will you\nlook at that, those little buggers don&rsquo;t grow in my graveyard. I&rsquo;ll have to\nhave a talk with the Wildmother. Aren&rsquo;t you just beautiful. And what about you&mdash;&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s\nmostly talking to himself&rdquo;, Beau explains while Molly watches Caduceus touch\nsome rather plain, yellow flowers he seems to find exceptionally beautiful.\nMolly thinks that Yasha will probably like him a lot.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>He tries to\nuse his voice again.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;do we\nadopt this one?&rdquo;, he rasps out.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Finally.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Beau\nsnorts.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hell if I\nknow. He turns dead people into mulch and heals, so I feel like he&rsquo;d be pretty\nuseful. And he wanted to leave his weird swamp. Garden. Graveyard. Whatever,\nyou&rsquo;ll see the place.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly\nlistens to Caduceus&rsquo; proclamations. <br /></p><p>He has such a calming voice that Molly\nactually falls asleep against Beau, his head lolling back onto her shoulder. In\nhis slumber he could swear that she wraps an arm around him to hold him upright\nand maybe it feels like she presses her hand on his ribs as if to see if he&rsquo;s\nstill breathing.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Molly didn&rsquo;t\nintend to sleep for so long but when he wakes up it&rsquo;s dark outside and he needs\na moment to realize where he is. This is definitely a graveyard, so it might be\nthe place the others talked about.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>It smells\noverwhelmingly of all different kinds of flowers, which is the first thing Molly\nnotices. <br /></p><p>The second thing is that he is the center of a cuddle pile. His head\nrests on Yasha&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;Jester is curled up against the both of them. Beau&rsquo;s\nhead lies on Jester&rsquo;s soft stomach while Nott is splayed all over Jester&rsquo;s legs.&nbsp;\n<br /></p><p>Caleb lies\na bit apart from them, but his hand is stretched out to bridge the distance and\nhis fingers lie just inches away from Molly&rsquo;s hand. Fjord sleeps on his side,\nquietly snoring while loosely hugging Beauregard from behind.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>This never\nhappened before but here they are, suddenly deeply connected through the trauma\nthat grabbed all of them, either in the form of loss or being lost in one way\nor the other. Molly would love to stay like this forever, he thinks. He hopes\nthat they&rsquo;ll keep on doing this even after the pain heals.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>As he turns\nhis head slightly his gaze locks onto a tall figure sitting on a boulder a few\nfeet away. It smells like tea and something smoky and sweet which he can&rsquo;t\nplace. And while Molly loves cuddling he can&rsquo;t bear to lie down for just a\nminute longer. His body wants to move again after lying in the dirt for so long\nso he gets up slowly before standing there beside his family, just watching\nthem sleep and snore and drool.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Damn, he\nloves them. All of them. So fucking much it actually hurts in his chest.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>His body\nstill feels as if someone put metal spikes into it but he still walks over to\nwhere Caduceus Clay drinks his tea and looks at the night sky. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;So this is\nwhere you get your dead-people-tea?&rdquo;, Molly asks and stretches his legs, his\narms, rolls his neck and wiggles his fingers. What a wonder this body is,\nmoving around on demand, heart beating steadily in his chest. All those nerve\nendings that feel as if someone set him on fire are just a sign that he is\nwonderfully alive. &nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes.\nYou want a cup?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,\nthanks. Maybe later.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly looks\nat the small pipe Caduceus holds in his other hand. The sweet and smoky smell\nseems to come directly out of there.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Want to\ntry, purple friend?&rdquo;, Caduceus asks and holds out the pipe for Molly.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;What is\nit?&rdquo;, Molly wants to know and takes the pipe, inspects it and smells it again.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you\nknow. It&rsquo;s just a bit more dead-people-tea but for smoking, I guess. Makes\nlonely nights less lonely and sometimes it makes the flowers sing.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Singing\nflowers sound as if Caduceus is talking about drugs and Molly is all for trying\nnew things, so he puts the pipe to his lips and inhales. It tastes as if\nsomeone set a field of sunflowers on fire, which is interesting enough and he\nenjoys the slight burn in his throat before he pushes the smoke out of his\nlungs and sends it up towards the sky.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Then he\nhands the pipe back to Caduceus.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for\nbringing me back&rdquo;, he says quietly. His voice still sounds as if he&rsquo;s been\nscreaming for hours.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s\nnot a big deal. Usually I&rsquo;m all for the natural order of things to unfold but\nyou know, your friends there told me all about you. How you only had two years\nin this borrowed body of yours. And, uh&mdash;violence is natural. But deliberate\ncruelty really isn&rsquo;t. So I feel like the Wildmother will understand why I uh&mdash;took\nsomeone back from her soil.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly\nwatches smoke escape Caduceus&rsquo;s mouth as he talks before the huge Firbolg hands\nthe pipe back to him.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Up in the\nsky the full moon shimmers brightly and bathes them in a pale light, making\nMolly wonder if the Moon Weaver is up there smiling down on him. He puts the\npipe to his lips again and breathes in.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; you\nlived here&hellip; how long?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, since\nI was born. Never been out that far before, let me tell you. It was quite the\nwild ride.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;And you\nlived here alone?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;No. My\nfamily lived here with me but they&rsquo;re all gone now. I&rsquo;ve been alone for&mdash;hm. Two\nseasons.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly knows\nthat there are probably more interesting topics to talk about with a Cleric who\nturns dead people into mulch and guards an ancient elven graveyard in the\nmiddle of a cursed forest. But he is still Mollymauk Tealeaf&mdash;thank the gods and\nthank his friends and also Caduceus&mdash;and these tealeaves he smokes at the moment\nmake his tongue looser than it usually is anyway.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;So that\nmeans you never had sex before?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Caduceus\nturns his head to look at Molly, his head cocked to the side, his eyes full of mirth.&nbsp;\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s\nwhat it means, aside from other stuff it means as well. We never got visitors\nout here. But I have plenty of visitors now.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Molly chuckles\nand thinks about this for a while and the pipe passes back and forth while\nCaduceus drinks his tea and looks at the moon. Sometimes he also looks at Molly\nas if he&rsquo;s trying to assess the weird and colorful mystery that is Mollymauk\nTealeaf.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you\nhear the flowers sing?&rdquo;, he asks after what seems like eternity.
