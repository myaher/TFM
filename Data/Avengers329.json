She enjoyed it, the way the city unfolded before her, splayed out like a hand of poker cards. </p><p>The stars glittered like the diamonds and watches she liked to snatch. They taunted her with winks and smiles and Fox hated them with all of her being. She hated a lot of things. </p><p>She hated people. <i>All</i> people. There wasn\u2019t a single person in the entire world that deserved her approval. There wasn\u2019t a person in the entire world who hadn\u2019t walked past someone like her, ignored a girl beaten by a man, or a man beaten by a girl. People ignored lousy parents all the time leaving children to suffer. </p><p>No, the world was full of bad apples. <i>Everyone</i> was a bad Apple. Even still, there was a wounded butterfly of hope inside of her chest that remained carefully guarded by wires and traps. </p><p>It was slowly dying. </p><p>Fox recalled all of it. The money she\u2019d made helping those damned scientists get their experiment back under control. The price she paid thanks to Alex\u2019s <i>stupid</i> friend. It had seemed worth it in the moment, the high of adrenaline was intoxicating, and for a moment she forgot her own plights. At the end it all came crashing down again, unavoidable was her reality. </p><p>Fox\u2019s throat tightened and she pried her eyes away from the sparkling city. They landed upon someone familiar but also foreign. \u201cWell, I never expected to see someone like you up here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCut the shit.\u201d James frowned. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d Fox mused. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard. All I had to do was ask around.\u201d James glowered. \u201cYou have one chance to be honest with me or I take you in.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTempting.\u201d Fox rolled her eyes and stood to balance carefully on the rooftop edge. </p><p>\u201cYou tipped the Wakandans off about Sage.\u201d James crossed his arms and jutted his jaw. \u201cAnd I know damn well you were the one who figured  out how to steal the vibranium. Who did you give it to?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Fox smiled coyly. \u201cI only know as little as possible.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d James\u2019 voice grew gruff with impatience. </p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Fox never knew more than the necessity. Any additional information was dangerous, making situations like the one at hand, even more deadly. Tattling on clients never ended well. </p><p>\u201cWhat are your clients planning? First Bianca, then vibranium, and lastly Sage.\u201d James tilted his head to study the other girl. She was sly, conniving, difficult, and shifty. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve playing so many games at once. I don\u2019t know the grand picture of your scheme-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJames, James, James&hellip;I don\u2019t have a plan. I work for anyone and everyone.\u201d Fox pivoted with ease upon the ledge. James grew nervous with how close she was to the edge of death, the last thing he wanted was to see someone\u2019s broken body on pavement. \u201cI do what I can to survive and there\u2019s nothing more to it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy with that.\u201d The red head shook his head. He was thankful his mother instilled her interrogation techniques in him-he could read her if he focused hard enough. \u201cYou\u2019re upping your game. You\u2019re getting bolder just like a serial killer does. You\u2019re bored, you\u2019re looking for the next high you can get. But what does a girl like you have to fight against? How in the hell do you have to \u2018<i>survive</i>?\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cNot everyone has Captain America as their father.\u201d Fox\u2019s lazy, sly smile shifted into a sneer. \u201cI\u2019ve told you that I do what I want when I want. That\u2019s all I know now get the fuck off of my roof.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour roof?\u201d James snorted. \u201cThis is the roof of a bar. Two floors. One for drunks and one for whores. You don\u2019t own it.\u201d </p><p>For the first time, in the few James had encountered this enigma of a girl, she gave away true emotion. It was vibrant anger in all sorts of fiery colors. \u201cThis <i>is</i> my roof. My name is Fox Duran.\u201d </p><p>James paled and felt his stomach tighten. \u201cThe owners are&hellip;the Durans.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGlad you figured it out.\u201d It was too fast for James to properly react. One moment he was fine and the next a hard punch rocked against his jaw. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you ever call any girl a whore you piece of shit. You have no <i>idea</i> what some people go through&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d James winced and rubbed his face. \u201cI just want to make sense of this! All of this! What\u2019s happening to my friends and my city. My sister is in constant danger because of the decisions <i>you\u2019re</i> making.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your sister!\u201d Fox yelled. \u201cI hate her more than I hate you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d James demanded. </p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s <i>exactly</i> like your <i>father</i>. Some charismatic piece of filth who acts like they can fix everything. It\u2019s all a lie! Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d Fox was no longer able to keep the passion from her voice. \u201cNothing is going to change! No matter how hard any of you fight this world is still going to be a shit hole!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d James argued as he stumbled back to his feet. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Fox\u2019s voice drifted into a terrifying quiet. \u201cYou\u2019ll let the witch go thinking she\u2019s changed and the moment she gets a chance she\u2019ll tear her uncle apart piece by piece. The girl with the metal arm is only going to remain sane until something triggers her effed up memories and it\u2019ll begin all over again. And if you stop them then someone else is going to fill their place. It\u2019s a never ending cycle.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve figured out the entire universe?\u201d James snorted. \u201cSorry honey, that\u2019s not true.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m the only one smart enough to figure it out. You wait and see.\u201d There was a challenge in her voice. A fire in her eyes so intense James felt himself wither under the stare. \u201cI see more than any of you do. I know exactly what kind of pain people go through. I know what that does to someone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeople always have choices to make. Pain can be turned into a tool.\u201d James finally found his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse to break laws and hurt other people.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just delivering the justice that needs to be dealt?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> don\u2019t get to play <i>God</i>.\u201d James spoke sternly. \u201cAnd you have yet to answer my questions. Tell me <i>exactly</i> what\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><p>An odd smile found it\u2019s way on Fox\u2019s face. It looked almost sad, like hope was firmly crushed for her, like she\u2019d tried to make someone else understand and it hadn\u2019t worked. It occurred to James that maybe she\u2019d had numerous conversations just like this with a dozen other people who had all ignored her. </p><p>She backed away slowly. \u201cYou want to know what\u2019s happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait&hellip;\u201d James made a motion to move as she stepped back onto the edge turning to face him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Rise of the Lost, James.\u201d Fox shook her head. \u201cEverything you know is going to be turned upside down. There aren\u2019t heroes or villains. There\u2019s only <i>people</i>.\u201d </p><p>Before he could do anything she stepped backwards and fell. Instinct made him dive to the edge in hope to catch her hand. He only grasped air. With a frantic panic he peered over the edge ready to locate a pulverized body. Instead he saw nothing. </p><p>Fox had vanished. </p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d With an angry huff James rocked back onto his knees and punched at the roof. The sound of feet landing lightly behind him queued his attention. </p><p>\u201cNo luck?\u201d It was Scout. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here?\u201d James questioned. </p><p>\u201cI felt your distress.\u201d Scout sighed. \u201cNot to mention the new boy, Orion I believe, said you left in a rush when I asked. You\u2019re conflicted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be.\u201d James shook his head. Scout rested a comforting hand on James\u2019 shoulder. </p><p>\u201cCome on, you need rest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI need answers.\u201d James groaned. He\u2019d promised to dig up information for Siyanda but this was not the information he wanted. </p><p>\u201cYou have them.\u201d Scout replied patiently. \u201cShe gave them to you. She\u2019s right. However, you\u2019re also right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell Scout, thanks for showing up.\u201d James sighed giving his friend a thankful look as he stood. \u201cMind giving me a ride home?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Scout smiled. \u201cIf you need to talk, I am always open to conversation. She\u2019s got a complicated mind from what I can sense. Someone who doesn\u2019t fit anywhere. She\u2019s not good or bad, as you put it, simply <i>human</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks Scout.\u201d James gave a final sigh of irritated contentment and allowed Scout to fly him from the roof. </p>",

She enjoyed it, the way the city unfolded before her, splayed out like a hand of poker cards. </p><p>The stars glittered like the diamonds and watches she liked to snatch. They taunted her with winks and smiles and Fox hated them with all of her being. She hated a lot of things. </p><p>She hated people. <i>All</i> people.

There wasn\u2019t a person in the entire world who hadn\u2019t walked past someone like her, ignored a girl beaten by a man, or a man beaten by a girl. People ignored lousy parents all the time leaving children to suffer. </p><p>No, the world was full of bad apples. <i>Everyone</i> was a bad Apple. Even still, there was a wounded butterfly of hope inside of her chest that remained carefully guarded by wires and traps. </p><p>It was slowly dying. </p><p>Fox recalled all of it. The money she\u2019d made helping those damned scientists get their experiment back under control. The price she paid thanks to Alex\u2019s <i>stupid</i> friend. It had seemed worth it in the moment, the high of adrenaline was intoxicating, and for a moment she forgot her own plights. At the end it all came crashing down again, unavoidable was her reality. </p><p>Fox\u2019s throat tightened and she pried her eyes away from the sparkling city. They landed upon someone familiar but also foreign. \u201cWell, I never expected to see someone like you up here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCut the shit.\u201d James frowned. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find me?\u201d Fox mused. </p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard. All I had to do was ask around.\u201d James glowered. \u201cYou have one chance to be honest with me or I take you in.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTempting.\u201d Fox rolled her eyes and stood to balance carefully on the rooftop edge. </p><p>\u201cYou tipped the Wakandans off about Sage.\u201d James crossed his arms and jutted his jaw. \u201cAnd I know damn well you were the one who figured  out how to steal the vibranium. Who did you give it to?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Fox smiled coyly. \u201cI only know as little as possible.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d James\u2019 voice grew gruff with impatience. </p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Fox never knew more than the necessity. Any additional information was dangerous, making situations like the one at hand, even more deadly. Tattling on clients never ended well. </p><p>\u201cWhat are your clients planning? First Bianca, then vibranium, and lastly Sage.\u201d James tilted his head to study the other girl. She was sly, conniving, difficult, and shifty. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve playing so many games at once. I don\u2019t know the grand picture of your scheme-\u201c</p><p>\u201cJames, James, James\u2026I don\u2019t have a plan. I work for anyone and everyone.\u201d Fox pivoted with ease upon the ledge. James grew nervous with how close she was to the edge of death, the last thing he wanted was to see someone\u2019s broken body on pavement. \u201cI do what I can to survive and there\u2019s nothing more to it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy with that.\u201d The red head shook his head. He was thankful his mother instilled her interrogation techniques in him-he could read her if he focused hard enough. \u201cYou\u2019re upping your game. You\u2019re getting bolder just like a serial killer does. You\u2019re bored, you\u2019re looking for the next high you can get. But what does a girl like you have to fight against? How in the hell do you have to \u2018<i>survive</i>?\u2019 \u201c</p><p>\u201cNot everyone has Captain America as their father.\u201d Fox\u2019s lazy, sly smile shifted into a sneer. \u201cI\u2019ve told you that I do what I want when I want. That\u2019s all I know now get the fuck off of my roof.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour roof?\u201d James snorted. \u201cThis is the roof of a bar. Two floors. One for drunks and one for whores. You don\u2019t own it.\u201d </p><p>For the first time, in the few James had encountered this enigma of a girl, she gave away true emotion. It was vibrant anger in all sorts of fiery colors. \u201cThis <i>is</i> my roof. My name is Fox Duran.\u201d </p><p>James paled and felt his stomach tighten. \u201cThe owners are\u2026the Durans.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGlad you figured it out.\u201d It was too fast for James to properly react. One moment he was fine and the next a hard punch rocked against his jaw. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you ever call any girl a whore you piece of shit. You have no <i>idea</i> what some people go through\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d James winced and rubbed his face. \u201cI just want to make sense of this! All of this! What\u2019s happening to my friends and my city. My sister is in constant danger because of the decisions <i>you\u2019re</i> making.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your sister!\u201d Fox yelled. \u201cI hate her more than I hate you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d James demanded. </p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s <i>exactly</i> like your <i>father</i>. Some charismatic piece of filth who acts like they can fix everything. It\u2019s all a lie! Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d Fox was no longer able to keep the passion from her voice. \u201cNothing is going to change! No matter how hard any of you fight this world is still going to be a shit hole!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d James argued as he stumbled back to his feet. </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Fox\u2019s voice drifted into a terrifying quiet. \u201cYou\u2019ll let the witch go thinking she\u2019s changed and the moment she gets a chance she\u2019ll tear her uncle apart piece by piece. The girl with the metal arm is only going to remain sane until something triggers her effed up memories and it\u2019ll begin all over again. And if you stop them then someone else is going to fill their place. It\u2019s a never ending cycle.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve figured out the entire universe?\u201d James snorted. \u201cSorry honey, that\u2019s not true.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m the only one smart enough to figure it out. You wait and see.\u201d There was a challenge in her voice. A fire in her eyes so intense James felt himself wither under the stare. \u201cI see more than any of you do. I know exactly what kind of pain people go through. I know what that does to someone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeople always have choices to make. Pain can be turned into a tool.\u201d James finally found his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse to break laws and hurt other people.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just delivering the justice that needs to be dealt?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> don\u2019t get to play <i>God</i>.\u201d James spoke sternly. \u201cAnd you have yet to answer my questions. Tell me <i>exactly</i> what\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><p>An odd smile found it\u2019s way on Fox\u2019s face. It looked almost sad, like hope was firmly crushed for her, like she\u2019d tried to make someone else understand and it hadn\u2019t worked. It occurred to James that maybe she\u2019d had numerous conversations just like this with a dozen other people who had all ignored her. </p><p>She backed away slowly. \u201cYou want to know what\u2019s happening?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait\u2026\u201d James made a motion to move as she stepped back onto the edge turning to face him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Rise of the Lost, James.\u201d Fox shook her head. \u201cEverything you know is going to be turned upside down. There aren\u2019t heroes or villains. There\u2019s only <i>people</i>.\u201d </p><p>Before he could do anything she stepped backwards and fell. Instinct made him dive to the edge in hope to catch her hand. He only grasped air. With a frantic panic he peered over the edge ready to locate a pulverized body. Instead he saw nothing. </p><p>Fox had vanished. </p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d With an angry huff James rocked back onto his knees and punched at the roof. The sound of feet landing lightly behind him queued his attention. </p><p>\u201cNo luck?\u201d It was Scout. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here?\u201d James questioned. </p><p>\u201cI felt your distress.\u201d Scout sighed. \u201cNot to mention the new boy, Orion I believe, said you left in a rush when I asked. You\u2019re conflicted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be.\u201d James shook his head. Scout rested a comforting hand on James\u2019 shoulder. </p><p>\u201cCome on, you need rest.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI need answers.\u201d James groaned. He\u2019d promised to dig up information for Siyanda but this was not the information he wanted. </p><p>\u201cYou have them.\u201d Scout replied patiently. \u201cShe gave them to you. She\u2019s right. However, you\u2019re also right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell Scout, thanks for showing up.\u201d James sighed giving his friend a thankful look as he stood. \u201cMind giving me a ride home?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Scout smiled. \u201cIf you need to talk, I am always open to conversation. She\u2019s got a complicated mind from what I can sense. Someone who doesn\u2019t fit anywhere. She\u2019s not good or bad, as you put it, simply <i>human</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks Scout.\u201d James gave a final sigh of irritated contentment and allowed Scout to fly him from the roof. </p></p>",
