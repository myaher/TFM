Instead, he just slipped the ring onto his fiance&rsquo;s finger, a simple silver band forged out of an alloy of Tony&rsquo;s own making; it consisted of gold-titanium, vibranium, and adamantium, so it would hold up in case Steve needed to handle the shield while wearing it, even without the heavy-duty gloves of his uniform. </p><p>And, because Tony was nothing if not a huge sap, on the inside of both their bands were matching inscriptions: <i>TOGETHER</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And do you, Steven Grant Rogers, take Anthony Stark as your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until death do you part?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve nodded, but didn&rsquo;t take his eyes off Tony, not even as he accepted the band from Happy, their designated ring bearer. And Tony definitely understood what must&rsquo;ve been running through his head at that moment, because Steve himself looked absolutely stunning: his hair was on just the right side of mussed, his jacket crisp and lint-rolled to perfection, his tie the same shade of light blue as his eyes, as the glow of the reactor, as the wedding party&rsquo;s suits. </p><p>And that smile, <i>god</i>, every time he saw it, big and bright, crow&rsquo;s feet crinkling, Tony fell just a little bit more in love. </p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Steve said, as he slid the ring onto Tony&rsquo;s finger, rubbing a thumb softly over his knuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and husband,&rdquo; the priest finished, the words rote but his smile genuine. &ldquo;You may kiss.&rdquo; </p><p>But before Tony could do much more than take a step closer, hands coming up to cup Steve&rsquo;s cheeks, the door to the chapel was suddenly and forcefully kicked in, and a swarm of HYDRA agents rushed in. </p><p>Without even thinking, Tony activated the gauntlet he&rsquo;d recently installed in a sleek, state-of-the-art watch (their something new), the armor taking form around his hand just in time to send a repulsor blast into the chest of the nearest HYDRA agent, knocking him flat on his back; on his six, Steve pulled out his shield (their something old), from where it was leaning casually against the organ, tossing it across the room and taking out three more of their uninvited guests.</p><p>The rest of the team jumped to action just as swiftly &mdash; Natasha pulling out two pistols from God-knows-where, Sam rounding up all the civilians and herding them out of the building, Thor swinging his hammer around wildly &mdash; as well as all of the SHIELD agents sitting in the pews. Hell, even Fury threw a few punches. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t worrying so much as it was annoying, the attack, but even more so was the fact that they were <i>this close</i> to sealing the deal. The service was all but over, and Tony, for all the contingencies he had in place, hadn&rsquo;t bothered to arrange for a back-up chapel, certain that no harebrained villain of the week would be so inconsiderate as to come in, guns ablazing, at barely half past noon. </p><p>So, not wanting to put the whole morning to waste, Tony interrupted Steve, who was busy calling out orders to the rest of the wedding party, with a light elbow to his side, grinning almost mischievously when he turned around. Steve&rsquo;s determined expression made way for something more smitten as soon as their eyes met, and without a word, Tony pulled him in for a kiss, slow and deep and absolutely perfect, and for a long moment there, everything around them seemed to freeze. All Tony could think about was the way Steve gasped into his mouth, the softness of his lips, the tenderness, like they had all the time in the world for this. The shield dropped to the ground with a metallic clang, freeing Steve&rsquo;s arms to wrap around Tony, holding him close, as they took a moment to themselves and reveled in the fact that they were finally, officially married. </p><p>Half the chapel burst out into cheers at the kiss, which might&rsquo;ve been more romantic if it wasn&rsquo;t followed by the sound of bodies hitting the floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready to kick some ass, Mr. Stark-Rogers?&rdquo; Tony murmured, lips curling into a smile. </p><p>Steve pressed one last kiss to the corner of his husband&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Oh, always.&rdquo; </p><p>And so they did. </p><p>Together. </p></blockquote></p>",

I\u2019ve admired him for a while, as he\nseems like a really nice guy, and the Avengers deal with a lot, with the whole\nsaving the world thing.\u201d You glanced back down at the question. \u201cBut I doubt I\u2019d\never get to meet him, but at least now everyone knows I love Tony Stark!\u201d You\nsmiled at the camera, and moved onto the next question.</p><hr><p>After that interview, and many months later you released\neven more music, and you were slowly getting recognised around the world, as\nmore people shared your songs.

You sighed, reaching for one of the\nless alcoholic drinks on the table, and had just taken a sip when you heard: \u201cIt\nfeels good to get away from the crowd occasionally, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There was something very familiar about that voice, so you\nturned around, about to agree with the mysterious person, but upon seeing them\nyou froze where you stood, almost dropping your drink.

You looked around, and nobody seemed to\nbe looking in your general direction, so an idea floated into your head. \u201cDo\nyou want to\u2026I don\u2019t know, get away from the noise a bit?\u201d You gestured in the\ndirection of the balcony. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Tony replied, before holding out his arm for\nyou to take. You laughed, and held onto his arm as he led you outside, where\nthe cool air felt lovely on your flushed skin, and the lights from the busy\ncity below shone onto your face. You looked over at Tony to find him already\nlooking at you.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is there something on my face?\u201d You chuckled,\nreaching up to pat your cheek nervously. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just look at a pretty girl once in a while?\u201d Tony\nteased, and you jokingly rolled your eyes, giggling. <i>You never giggle, how has this man managed to turn you into the dumbest\nperson alive? </i>You scolded yourself. \u201cI want to get to know you more, Y/N.\u201d\nTony spoke seriously, shifting a little on his feet, and you tucked a loose\npiece of hair behind your ear nervously. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re busy with your\nmusic, but I would really like to take you out somewhere.\u201d </p><p>You stared in disbelief. \u201cYou want to-to take me on a date?\u201d\nYou asked, and Tony nodded casually, as though he\u2019d asked you something\nextremely simple, like what your favourite colour was. \u201cTony Stark wants to go\non a date with me!\u201d You whispered to yourself in shock, and Tony chuckled,\ntaking a couple of steps closer to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just think that you and I get along well, and why prevent\nsomething that is obviously a good idea and that could work?\u201d Tony shrugged,\ntilting his head as he looked at you. \u201cSo what do you say, Y/N? Give me a\nchance to sweep you off your feet, maybe literally a couple of times.\u201d He\nspread his arms open, a famous pose that you knew he pulled many times.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know.\u201d You said teasingly, moving towards him\nslightly. \u201cIs a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist enough for\nsomeone like me?\u201d You pulled a thoughtful face, as one of Tony\u2019s hands crept up\nyour back, pulling you closer to him. \u201cI think I can give it a try.\u201d Tony\nflashed you a winning smile, and pressed a quick kiss to your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>Tony reached into his pocket and pulled out a slip of paper.\n\u201cHere\u2019s my number, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not leaving you just yet.\u201d You tucked\nthe paper into your bag, and that night was the happiest you\u2019d been in a while.</p><hr><p>\u00a0But obviously when Tony left and you were in your room alone\nyou had to scream into your pillow because <i>oh\nmy god Tony Stark is into you and you\u2019re going on a date with him. </i>And he\nwas right, you two did make it work.\u00a0</p>",

You hadn\u2019t\nstarted off well known at all, you studied music in school and college, then\ngone on to sing on city streets for fun in your spare time. But you didn\u2019t stay\nhidden for long, because somewhere along the line someone had uploaded a video\nto Youtube of you singing, and it had gone viral. The next time you went on\ntwitter your phone actually crashed from the amount of people that had been\ntweeting you, and messaging you, and it didn\u2019t take too long after that for\nyour now producer to get in touch with you. </p><p>When you released your first single, the amount of people\nwho were buying, downloading and streaming your song was enough to keep you at\nthe top of the charts for a week and a half. Everyone loved it, and it was even\nenough to get other people to notice you. You\u2019d learn later in life that Peter\nParker was a fan of your music, and that\u2019s really where all the excitement\nbegan.\u00a0</p><hr><p>You\u2019d been booked in for an interview by your producer, so\nthat your fans could know more about you and what you liked. You\u2019d been given a\npiece of white cardboard, with little bits of paper that you could pull off, to\nsee what was written underneath. </p><p>\u201cAnd this one says\u2026\u201d You paused as you pulled a piece of\npaper off. \u201cWho is Y/N Y/L/N\u2019s favourite Avenger?\u201d You grinned at the question,\nand laughed at the camera. \u201cYou can\u2019t just ask a question like that, all the\nAvengers are amazing and they all do an amazing job.\u201d You thought for a moment.\n\u201cBut honestly, I think Iron Man has to be my favourite.\u201d You laughed again as\nthe crew behind the cameras chuckled at your answer. \u201cI love Tony Stark, I have\nto admit that.\u201d You smiled. \u201cI really respect Tony Stark, how he deals with the\npress, and how he balances his work life. I\u2019ve admired him for a while, as he\nseems like a really nice guy, and the Avengers deal with a lot, with the whole\nsaving the world thing.\u201d You glanced back down at the question. \u201cBut I doubt I\u2019d\never get to meet him, but at least now everyone knows I love Tony Stark!\u201d You\nsmiled at the camera, and moved onto the next question.</p><hr><p>After that interview, and many months later you released\neven more music, and you were slowly getting recognised around the world, as\nmore people shared your songs. You\u2019d even met some of your favourite artists,\nand you didn\u2019t think your life would get better than this, because this was\nmore than what you\u2019d dreamed of.</p><p>Or so you thought, until it had been a year since you\nreleased your first song, and to celebrate your producer had thrown a (very)\nbig, formal party to honour the start of your career. There were more than a\nfew recognisable faces there, and you had been overwhelmed for most of the\nnight, greeting so many of your idols, them congratulating you and\ncomplimenting you on your music and achievements. </p><p>Eventually, you managed to get away from the bigger part of\nthe crowd, and stand next to one of the many small tables that littered the\nroom that held various expensive drinks. You sighed, reaching for one of the\nless alcoholic drinks on the table, and had just taken a sip when you heard: \u201cIt\nfeels good to get away from the crowd occasionally, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There was something very familiar about that voice, so you\nturned around, about to agree with the mysterious person, but upon seeing them\nyou froze where you stood, almost dropping your drink. There before you, that\nfamiliar smirk on his face, stood Tony Stark himself.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d You whispered, putting a hand over your mouth,\nstaring in utter disbelief at Tony. \u201cYou\u2019re Tony Stark!\u201d You said a little bit louder,\nyour voice a little bit higher this time. \u201cOh my god!\u201d You put your drink down\nas Tony laughed, and you gaped at him, but it was quickly overtaken by the\nbiggest smile that had ever appeared on your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Y/N.\u201d Tony replied, repositioning his\nsunglasses that he seemed to never take off on his head. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about\nyou, but none of the videos you\u2019re in show how beautiful you are.\u201d His smirk\ngrew as you turned a bright red, looking down shyly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026I\u2019m so..\u201d You stuttered, your mind in ruins because <i>holy shit did Tony Stark just call you\nbeautiful? </i>Tony chuckled as you tried to find the right words. \u201cIt\u2019s so\namazing to meet you, I\u2019ve always dreamed of meting you and that sounds weird\nbut I didn\u2019t mean it to be weird, and I promise I\u2019m a lot cooler than this\nnormally.\u201d You said in a rush, feeling utterly stupid. \u201cHow did you even get\nhere?\u201d You asked, taking another sip of your drink, gesturing for Tony to take\none if he wanted.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have an apprentice of sorts back home, as you may\nwell know since you love me so much.\u201d Tony winked at you as he took a larger\nsip of his drink. \u201cAnd he brought you to my attention not too long ago, as he\nis definitely one of your biggest fans.\u201d At your amazed look, he grinned. \u201cSeriously,\nhe won\u2019t stop talking about your music, and this time I relented and let him\nfangirl about you to no end, until he showed me this video of you doing an\ninterview.\u201d He pulled out his phone to show you the video where you admitted\nyou were obsessed with Tony. \u201cAnd from the moment I saw you I just knew that I\nhad to find you somehow, so I got in touch with your producer, and he invited\nme here without telling you.\u201d Tony looked at you over his glass, amusement\ntwinkling in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to meet me that much?\u201d You asked, in awe of the\nman standing infront of you. \u201cI don\u2019t think someone\u2019s wanted to meet me that\nbadly before.\u201d You smiled shyly at Tony, and you felt a warm fuzzy feeling\ninside everytime he smiled back at you. You looked around, and nobody seemed to\nbe looking in your general direction, so an idea floated into your head. \u201cDo\nyou want to\u2026I don\u2019t know, get away from the noise a bit?\u201d You gestured in the\ndirection of the balcony. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Tony replied, before holding out his arm for\nyou to take. You laughed, and held onto his arm as he led you outside, where\nthe cool air felt lovely on your flushed skin, and the lights from the busy\ncity below shone onto your face. You looked over at Tony to find him already\nlooking at you.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is there something on my face?\u201d You chuckled,\nreaching up to pat your cheek nervously. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just look at a pretty girl once in a while?\u201d Tony\nteased, and you jokingly rolled your eyes, giggling. <i>You never giggle, how has this man managed to turn you into the dumbest\nperson alive? </i>You scolded yourself. \u201cI want to get to know you more, Y/N.\u201d\nTony spoke seriously, shifting a little on his feet, and you tucked a loose\npiece of hair behind your ear nervously. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re busy with your\nmusic, but I would really like to take you out somewhere.\u201d </p><p>You stared in disbelief. \u201cYou want to-to take me on a date?\u201d\nYou asked, and Tony nodded casually, as though he\u2019d asked you something\nextremely simple, like what your favourite colour was. \u201cTony Stark wants to go\non a date with me!\u201d You whispered to yourself in shock, and Tony chuckled,\ntaking a couple of steps closer to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just think that you and I get along well, and why prevent\nsomething that is obviously a good idea and that could work?\u201d Tony shrugged,\ntilting his head as he looked at you. \u201cSo what do you say, Y/N? Give me a\nchance to sweep you off your feet, maybe literally a couple of times.\u201d He\nspread his arms open, a famous pose that you knew he pulled many times.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know.\u201d You said teasingly, moving towards him\nslightly. \u201cIs a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist enough for\nsomeone like me?\u201d You pulled a thoughtful face, as one of Tony\u2019s hands crept up\nyour back, pulling you closer to him. \u201cI think I can give it a try.\u201d Tony\nflashed you a winning smile, and pressed a quick kiss to your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>Tony reached into his pocket and pulled out a slip of paper.\n\u201cHere\u2019s my number, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not leaving you just yet.\u201d You tucked\nthe paper into your bag, and that night was the happiest you\u2019d been in a while.</p><hr><p>\u00a0But obviously when Tony left and you were in your room alone\nyou had to scream into your pillow because <i>oh\nmy god Tony Stark is into you and you\u2019re going on a date with him. </i>And he\nwas right, you two did make it work.\u00a0</p></p>",
