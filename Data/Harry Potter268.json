Now fulfilling his ambitions as a dragonologist apprentice in Romania\u2014a dream he realized against the Rosier Death Eater legacy\u2014you thought about how much more different he was.\r</p><p>You remembered the evening he told you the news. He was chosen as one of only three apprentices of the legendary dragon expert Maurice Roirdan (who was mentored under the greatest dragonologist Quang Po). Outside both his duties as a former Slytherin prefect and as the now-estranged son of Evan Rosier, you saw him light up\u2014the truest, purest Felix he had never shown anyone else. And you knew it was well-deserved. He was intelligent, hardworking, charismatic, and above all, the absolute poster-boy of the Slytherin House; who else would deserve the opportunity other than him?\r</p><p>And you were the first one he told. That evening was full of firsts, now that you thought about it. The first time you saw Felix\u2019s raw emotions. The first time he spoke to you as honestly as a dear friend. The first time your fingers laced together. The first time he pulled you into his arms that he was practically radiating warmth with so much joy. The first time you saw\u2014and he showed you!\u2014how unabashedly happy he was.\r</p><p>You reasoned that perhaps you were both just utterly intoxicated by the night\u2019s festivities. They did say that Hogwarts\u2019 Yule Ball was always going to be a night to remember and it certainly was. The happiness that flowed between you was made even more contagious that time.\r</p><p>Because when your and Felix Rosier\u2019s lips met, neither of you ever forgot it.\r</p><p>\u201cPost\u2019s here,\u201d Ben Copper announced, ducking beneath his textbook to avoid the sudden downpour of parcels. A package dropped on top of his OWLs notes as did the rest of the group\u2019s.\r</p><p>Care packages from the eager parents of the school\u2019s seniors. It was as traditional as the annual onslaught of third years on their first Hogsmeade visit. With seventh year students revising for their dreaded OWLs, parents and guardians usually delivered gifts and messages of support and good luck. When your parents learned this, they constantly asked what your favourite sweets were. It looked as though they threw in a few more goodies too.\r</p><p>Just as your hands touched the box before you, a second, smaller parcel dropped on top of it. You looked up and the second owl seemed to squawk at you in apology. You picked it up and read the name\u2014yours, in an unmistakable penmanship.\r</p><p>Tulip Karasu was the first to notice and badgered you. \u201cKeeping secrets again, eh?\u201d she teased. \u201cIs it a little good luck charm from your secret admirer? \u2018Good luck on your OWLs! I\u2019ll be thinking of you!\u2019\u201d she said, laughing. The others snickered and giggled too.\r</p><p>It was common knowledge to your circle that someone had been consistently sending you letters. What wasn\u2019t common knowledge was that these letters came from your former prefect Felix. And they weren\u2019t just any sort of letters&hellip;\r</p><p>But no one needed to know that. You were just thankful you\u2019d kept that secret from them successfully for so long. (And whether they had an inkling or not, none of them had ever given you comment on it.)\r</p><p>You simply shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our OWLs to worry about. Come on, no distractions.\u201d Just to prove your point, you set aside even your family\u2019s gifts and opened your Divination book where you left off.\r</p><p>-\r</p><p>Your friends retreated to the Three Broomsticks for an evening butterbeer fix or two. You had half the mind to join them, but declined instead. Felix\u2019s latest letter was still on your mind. (You felt a little guilty lying to them, but the heart bent over backwards for the silliest reasons sometimes. They\u2019ll realize it themselves someday, you convince yourself.)\r</p><p>Closing the door behind you, you took out the parcel from your robe\u2019s pocket. A small pale envelope was wrapped on an even smaller box with a piece of twine. No frills, nothing fancy; as straightforward and simply elegant as its sender.\r</p><p>First the letter:\r</p><p><i>Ma cherie,\r</i></p><p><i>You must be terribly busy with your revising, so please don\u2019t worry about responding too soon\u2014though it would always be appreciated. Don\u2019t forget the mnemonics I taught you.\r</i></p><p><i>Enough about the OWLs for now. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aching for a breather.\r</i></p><p><i>Romania is more than I ever imagined. The barracks overlook these mountain ranges where we were told a family of Ridgebacks have nested. We\u2019re traveling there tomorrow. I\u2019m not looking forward to another hatchling following me around again after the last one singed my favourite boots.\r</i></p><p><i>The hide gloves you gave me are, thankfully, still intact. Thank you again, by the way. Saved me the blisters Giorgio and Harris received from roping the Silvertalon bull. Now they\u2019re asking where these gloves are from!\r</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait until the holidays to see you. I know it\u2019s months away, but it\u2019s the very thing that\u2019s keeping me going. I miss you terribly\u2014admittedly like you said I would.\r</i></p><p><i>But I haven\u2019t bawled my eyes out, so that counts as a point for me. And no, it\u2019s not because the lads would endlessly tease me over it, but because it\u2019s too cold to cry.\r</i></p><p><i>Before you chastise me in your next letter, I will say I could certainly use your embrace right now.\r</i></p><p><i>Happy?\r</i></p><p><i>Yours,\r</i></p><p><i>Felix</i>\r</p><p>You smiled, clutching the letter close to your chest. (You didn\u2019t care how clich\u00e9 it might have looked.) Glancing back to the letter, you were surprised by the little note Felix quickly scribbled last near the bottom of the parchment:\r</p><p><i>PS. Think of me when you wear this.\r</i></p><p>The parcel! You almost forgot about the nondescript box tied to the letter. Unwrapping it quickly, you lifted the cardboard lid open and you felt your smile grow wider. Sitting in the middle of the box was a gold pendant of a dragon taking flight.\r</p><p>It was fitting of the sender and oddly comforting how subtle it looked around your neck. You knew then and there you were never going to take it off.\r</p><p>You had to reply to him, regardless of his saying you needed the time for study.\r</p><p><i>Dear Felix,\r</i></p><p><i>I should be studying\u2014and I am, I swear!\u2014but when I read your letter, I just couldn\u2019t keep myself from sending one back right away.\r</i></p><p><i>I miss you, you know I do. Not in the way the rest of Slytherin does, but you know how much I do.\r</i></p><p><i>You should also know, by the way, that even the first years have built a sort of respect for their first prefect\u2014you\u2019re a bit of a celebrity here now! Everyone is far more determined to earn House points and I think that was your doing. I even heard rumours that Professor Snape sometimes slips, comparing the current prefect to you. I guess that means he liked you, in his special little Snape-y way.</i></p><p><i>Thank you for the necklace too. I absolutely love it! And telling me to think of you whenever I wear it&hellip; Well, I have no plans of ever taking it off.\r</i></p><p><i>Romania sounds breath-taking and it also sounds like your work there is hectic! A good kind of hectic, I assume? No matter, I know you of all people are completely capable of doing an amazing job there.\r</i></p><p><i>By the way, Charlie\u2019s really keen on applying for the apprenticeship there too after Hogwarts. Do you have any tips for him?\r</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry for rambling. You know how excited I get whenever you write me things. And I know you want me to get back to my revising. Your letters always give me that much-needed breath of fresh air.\r</i></p><p><i>Well, back to the grind. Write me again soon please?\r</i></p><p>You signed your name at the lower portion of the parchment and added one more thing:\r</p><p><i>PS. Come back to me sooner and maybe we can arrange something more than an embrace.\r</i></p><p>You felt a light flush rising in your cheeks as you sealed the letter. After dipping your quill in some ink, you addressed it to Felix\u2014a script he once said looked like chicken scratch, but still gave him a sense of comfort to read. You laughed to yourself at the memory of it and kissed his name on the envelope. It was a little too late at night to head to the owlery to send it, but you reminded yourself to get to it first thing tomorrow.\r</p><p>-\r</p><p>You wondered if Felix realises that his immediate reply to your reply defeats his own point. He incessantly reminds you to study hard for the OWLs, yet quickly sends another letter.\r</p><p>Your relationship is special that way, you reasoned. Felix can be focused on a myriad of things, but when it came to you, you could read his attention was all on you. You made a note to tease him about this in your next response\u2014it was endearing, but you knew better than to be a distraction and vice versa.\r</p><p>But basically you thought it was cute.\r</p><p><i>Ma cherie,\r</i></p><p><i>I really do hope I\u2019m not keeping you from your OWLs. No matter how smart you think you are\u2014and talented, and skilled, and charming\u2014do not fail Slytherin. Please do this for our House, for me.\r</i></p><p><i>Really? A celebrity? Sounds like a bad fad. Don\u2019t tell me Slytherin\u2019s gone soft now that I\u2019ve left. If it has, Hufflepuff may have doubled its badgers.\r</i></p><p><i>And please never ever say \u2018Snape-y\u2019 again.\r</i></p><p><i>Also, you mean Charles Weasley, right? I don\u2019t know what to say. There\u2019s so few of us to reference our skills and credentials. I\u2019m telling you that both Harris and Giorgio are far different from each other and from me.\r</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m glad to hear you like the gift. The nearest village I purchased it from is not near at all and that was the best thing I could find there. If you plan to wear it that much, you might not get any studying done at all!\r</i></p><p><i>I do wish I could see it on you though.\r</i></p><p><i>Yours,\r</i></p><p><i>Felix</i>\r</p><p><i>PS. More than an embrace? Very tempting.\r</i></p><p>Your cheeks turned so scarlet that your face could have been mistaken for a Gryffindor banner. Your stomach felt like the first time you did a Loop the Loop in Flying class and you tried your damnedest to hold it in. Your friends didn\u2019t seem to read the excitement you hid inside as you re-joined their study table.\r</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the book&hellip;?\u201d Rowan Khanna asked. You volunteered earlier to search for some reference material for brewing liquid luck in one of the library aisles, only to return empty-handed.\r</p><p>Of all the damned things to remind you, steeling you from studying! <i>Felix</i> Felicis!\r</p><p>You swore sibilantly, remembering. Madam Pince shushed you from several rows away. (Barnaby Lee once commented that Madam Pince must have been part elephant, considering how powerful her hearing must be. That was, until Penny Haywood slapped the back of his head to correct his analogy.)\r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d you said, feigning a groan. \u201cAll this studying\u2019s draining my head&hellip;\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take a break soon, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Rowan said, then addressed the Ravenclaw. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s looking rather pointless for you to defend, Andre.\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Khanna, Felixempra is done left to right!\u201d argued Andre Egwu.\r</p><p>\u201cWho draws a figure eight like that? It doesn\u2019t matter! Even if you ask Zygmunt Budge, you could easily ruin a perfectly brewed batch of Felix Felicis!\u201d\r</p><p>Andre threw his hands up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to tell you, Rowan. I read what I read and I will stand by it. Felixempra: left to right.\u201d\r</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see that book then,\u201d grumbled your best friend.\r</p><p>As you walked away, you couldn\u2019t help but conceal a smile from hearing Felix\u2019s name being spoken again and again.\r</p><p>Damn it. Stop blushing so much.</p>",

And telling me to think of you whenever I wear it\u2026 Well, I have no plans of ever taking it off.\r</i></p><p><i>Romania sounds breath-taking and it also sounds like your work there is hectic!

After dipping your quill in some ink, you addressed it to Felix\u2014a script he once said looked like chicken scratch, but still gave him a sense of comfort to read. You laughed to yourself at the memory of it and kissed his name on the envelope. It was a little too late at night to head to the owlery to send it, but you reminded yourself to get to it first thing tomorrow.\r</p><p>-\r</p><p>You wondered if Felix realises that his immediate reply to your reply defeats his own point. He incessantly reminds you to study hard for the OWLs, yet quickly sends another letter.\r</p><p>Your relationship is special that way, you reasoned. Felix can be focused on a myriad of things, but when it came to you, you could read his attention was all on you. You made a note to tease him about this in your next response\u2014it was endearing, but you knew better than to be a distraction and vice versa.\r</p><p>But basically you thought it was cute.\r</p><p><i>Ma cherie,\r</i></p><p><i>I really do hope I\u2019m not keeping you from your OWLs. No matter how smart you think you are\u2014and talented, and skilled, and charming\u2014do not fail Slytherin. Please do this for our House, for me.\r</i></p><p><i>Really? A celebrity? Sounds like a bad fad. Don\u2019t tell me Slytherin\u2019s gone soft now that I\u2019ve left. If it has, Hufflepuff may have doubled its badgers.\r</i></p><p><i>And please never ever say \u2018Snape-y\u2019 again.\r</i></p><p><i>Also, you mean Charles Weasley, right? I don\u2019t know what to say. There\u2019s so few of us to reference our skills and credentials.

More than an embrace? Very tempting.\r</i></p><p>Your cheeks turned so scarlet that your face could have been mistaken for a Gryffindor banner. Your stomach felt like the first time you did a Loop the Loop in Flying class and you tried your damnedest to hold it in. Your friends didn\u2019t seem to read the excitement you hid inside as you re-joined their study table.\r</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the book\u2026?\u201d Rowan Khanna asked. You volunteered earlier to search for some reference material for brewing liquid luck in one of the library aisles, only to return empty-handed.\r</p><p>Of all the damned things to remind you, steeling you from studying! <i>Felix</i> Felicis!\r</p><p>You swore sibilantly, remembering. Madam Pince shushed you from several rows away. (Barnaby Lee once commented that Madam Pince must have been part elephant, considering how powerful her hearing must be.

Now fulfilling his ambitions as a dragonologist apprentice in Romania\u2014a dream he realized against the Rosier Death Eater legacy\u2014you thought about how much more different he was.\r</p><p>You remembered the evening he told you the news. He was chosen as one of only three apprentices of the legendary dragon expert Maurice Roirdan (who was mentored under the greatest dragonologist Quang Po). Outside both his duties as a former Slytherin prefect and as the now-estranged son of Evan Rosier, you saw him light up\u2014the truest, purest Felix he had never shown anyone else. And you knew it was well-deserved. He was intelligent, hardworking, charismatic, and above all, the absolute poster-boy of the Slytherin House; who else would deserve the opportunity other than him?\r</p><p>And you were the first one he told. That evening was full of firsts, now that you thought about it. The first time you saw Felix\u2019s raw emotions. The first time he spoke to you as honestly as a dear friend. The first time your fingers laced together. The first time he pulled you into his arms that he was practically radiating warmth with so much joy. The first time you saw\u2014and he showed you!\u2014how unabashedly happy he was.\r</p><p>You reasoned that perhaps you were both just utterly intoxicated by the night\u2019s festivities. They did say that Hogwarts\u2019 Yule Ball was always going to be a night to remember and it certainly was. The happiness that flowed between you was made even more contagious that time.\r</p><p>Because when your and Felix Rosier\u2019s lips met, neither of you ever forgot it.\r</p><p>\u201cPost\u2019s here,\u201d Ben Copper announced, ducking beneath his textbook to avoid the sudden downpour of parcels. A package dropped on top of his OWLs notes as did the rest of the group\u2019s.\r</p><p>Care packages from the eager parents of the school\u2019s seniors. It was as traditional as the annual onslaught of third years on their first Hogsmeade visit. With seventh year students revising for their dreaded OWLs, parents and guardians usually delivered gifts and messages of support and good luck. When your parents learned this, they constantly asked what your favourite sweets were. It looked as though they threw in a few more goodies too.\r</p><p>Just as your hands touched the box before you, a second, smaller parcel dropped on top of it. You looked up and the second owl seemed to squawk at you in apology. You picked it up and read the name\u2014yours, in an unmistakable penmanship.\r</p><p>Tulip Karasu was the first to notice and badgered you. \u201cKeeping secrets again, eh?\u201d she teased. \u201cIs it a little good luck charm from your secret admirer? \u2018Good luck on your OWLs! I\u2019ll be thinking of you!\u2019\u201d she said, laughing. The others snickered and giggled too.\r</p><p>It was common knowledge to your circle that someone had been consistently sending you letters. What wasn\u2019t common knowledge was that these letters came from your former prefect Felix. And they weren\u2019t just any sort of letters\u2026\r</p><p>But no one needed to know that. You were just thankful you\u2019d kept that secret from them successfully for so long. (And whether they had an inkling or not, none of them had ever given you comment on it.)\r</p><p>You simply shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our OWLs to worry about. Come on, no distractions.\u201d Just to prove your point, you set aside even your family\u2019s gifts and opened your Divination book where you left off.\r</p><p>-\r</p><p>Your friends retreated to the Three Broomsticks for an evening butterbeer fix or two. You had half the mind to join them, but declined instead. Felix\u2019s latest letter was still on your mind. (You felt a little guilty lying to them, but the heart bent over backwards for the silliest reasons sometimes. They\u2019ll realize it themselves someday, you convince yourself.)\r</p><p>Closing the door behind you, you took out the parcel from your robe\u2019s pocket. A small pale envelope was wrapped on an even smaller box with a piece of twine. No frills, nothing fancy; as straightforward and simply elegant as its sender.\r</p><p>First the letter:\r</p><p><i>Ma cherie,\r</i></p><p><i>You must be terribly busy with your revising, so please don\u2019t worry about responding too soon\u2014though it would always be appreciated. Don\u2019t forget the mnemonics I taught you.\r</i></p><p><i>Enough about the OWLs for now. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aching for a breather.\r</i></p><p><i>Romania is more than I ever imagined. The barracks overlook these mountain ranges where we were told a family of Ridgebacks have nested. We\u2019re traveling there tomorrow. I\u2019m not looking forward to another hatchling following me around again after the last one singed my favourite boots.\r</i></p><p><i>The hide gloves you gave me are, thankfully, still intact. Thank you again, by the way. Saved me the blisters Giorgio and Harris received from roping the Silvertalon bull. Now they\u2019re asking where these gloves are from!\r</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait until the holidays to see you. I know it\u2019s months away, but it\u2019s the very thing that\u2019s keeping me going. I miss you terribly\u2014admittedly like you said I would.\r</i></p><p><i>But I haven\u2019t bawled my eyes out, so that counts as a point for me. And no, it\u2019s not because the lads would endlessly tease me over it, but because it\u2019s too cold to cry.\r</i></p><p><i>Before you chastise me in your next letter, I will say I could certainly use your embrace right now.\r</i></p><p><i>Happy?\r</i></p><p><i>Yours,\r</i></p><p><i>Felix</i>\r</p><p>You smiled, clutching the letter close to your chest. (You didn\u2019t care how clich\u00e9 it might have looked.) Glancing back to the letter, you were surprised by the little note Felix quickly scribbled last near the bottom of the parchment:\r</p><p><i>PS. Think of me when you wear this.\r</i></p><p>The parcel! You almost forgot about the nondescript box tied to the letter. Unwrapping it quickly, you lifted the cardboard lid open and you felt your smile grow wider. Sitting in the middle of the box was a gold pendant of a dragon taking flight.\r</p><p>It was fitting of the sender and oddly comforting how subtle it looked around your neck.

Come on, no distractions.&rdquo; Just to prove your point, you set aside even your family&rsquo;s gifts and opened your Divination book where you left off.\r</p><p>-\r</p><p>Your friends retreated to the Three Broomsticks for an evening butterbeer fix or two. You had half the mind to join them, but declined instead. Felix&rsquo;s latest letter was still on your mind. (You felt a little guilty lying to them, but the heart bent over backwards for the silliest reasons sometimes. They&rsquo;ll realize it themselves someday, you convince yourself.)\r</p><p>Closing the door behind you, you took out the parcel from your robe&rsquo;s pocket. A small pale envelope was wrapped on an even smaller box with a piece of twine. No frills, nothing fancy; as straightforward and simply elegant as its sender.\r</p><p>First the letter:\r</p><p><i>Ma cherie,\r</i></p><p><i>You must be terribly busy with your revising, so please don&rsquo;t worry about responding too soon&mdash;though it would always be appreciated. Don&rsquo;t forget the mnemonics I taught you.\r</i></p><p><i>Enough about the OWLs for now. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aching for a breather.\r</i></p><p><i>Romania is more than I ever imagined. The barracks overlook these mountain ranges where we were told a family of Ridgebacks have nested. We&rsquo;re traveling there tomorrow. I&rsquo;m not looking forward to another hatchling following me around again after the last one singed my favourite boots.\r</i></p><p><i>The hide gloves you gave me are, thankfully, still intact. Thank you again, by the way. Saved me the blisters Giorgio and Harris received from roping the Silvertalon bull. Now they&rsquo;re asking where these gloves are from!\r</i></p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t wait until the holidays to see you. I know it&rsquo;s months away, but it&rsquo;s the very thing that&rsquo;s keeping me going. I miss you terribly&mdash;admittedly like you said I would.\r</i></p><p><i>But I haven&rsquo;t bawled my eyes out, so that counts as a point for me. And no, it&rsquo;s not because the lads would endlessly tease me over it, but because it&rsquo;s too cold to cry.\r</i></p><p><i>Before you chastise me in your next letter, I will say I could certainly use your embrace right now.\r</i></p><p><i>Happy?\r</i></p><p><i>Yours,\r</i></p><p><i>Felix</i>\r</p><p>You smiled, clutching the letter close to your chest. (You didn&rsquo;t care how clich&eacute; it might have looked.) Glancing back to the letter, you were surprised by the little note Felix quickly scribbled last near the bottom of the parchment:\r</p><p><i>PS. Think of me when you wear this.\r</i></p><p>The parcel! You almost forgot about the nondescript box tied to the letter. Unwrapping it quickly, you lifted the cardboard lid open and you felt your smile grow wider. Sitting in the middle of the box was a gold pendant of a dragon taking flight.\r</p><p>It was fitting of the sender and oddly comforting how subtle it looked around your neck. You knew then and there you were never going to take it off.\r</p><p>You had to reply to him, regardless of his saying you needed the time for study.\r</p><p><i>Dear Felix,\r</i></p><p><i>I should be studying&mdash;and I am, I swear!&mdash;but when I read your letter, I just couldn&rsquo;t keep myself from sending one back right away.\r</i></p><p><i>I miss you, you know I do. Not in the way the rest of Slytherin does, but you know how much I do.\r</i></p><p><i>You should also know, by the way, that even the first years have built a sort of respect for their first prefect&mdash;you&rsquo;re a bit of a celebrity here now! Everyone is far more determined to earn House points and I think that was your doing. I even heard rumours that Professor Snape sometimes slips, comparing the current prefect to you. I guess that means he liked you, in his special little Snape-y way.</i></p><p><i>Thank you for the necklace too. I absolutely love it! And telling me to think of you whenever I wear it&hellip; Well, I have no plans of ever taking it off.\r</i></p><p><i>Romania sounds breath-taking and it also sounds like your work there is hectic! A good kind of hectic, I assume? No matter, I know you of all people are completely capable of doing an amazing job there.\r</i></p><p><i>By the way, Charlie&rsquo;s really keen on applying for the apprenticeship there too after Hogwarts. Do you have any tips for him?\r</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry for rambling. You know how excited I get whenever you write me things. And I know you want me to get back to my revising. Your letters always give me that much-needed breath of fresh air.\r</i></p><p><i>Well, back to the grind. Write me again soon please?\r</i></p><p>You signed your name at the lower portion of the parchment and added one more thing:\r</p><p><i>PS. Come back to me sooner and maybe we can arrange something more than an embrace.\r</i></p><p>You felt a light flush rising in your cheeks as you sealed the letter. After dipping your quill in some ink, you addressed it to Felix&mdash;a script he once said looked like chicken scratch, but still gave him a sense of comfort to read. You laughed to yourself at the memory of it and kissed his name on the envelope. It was a little too late at night to head to the owlery to send it, but you reminded yourself to get to it first thing tomorrow.\r</p><p>-\r</p><p>You wondered if Felix realises that his immediate reply to your reply defeats his own point. He incessantly reminds you to study hard for the OWLs, yet quickly sends another letter.\r</p><p>Your relationship is special that way, you reasoned. Felix can be focused on a myriad of things, but when it came to you, you could read his attention was all on you. You made a note to tease him about this in your next response&mdash;it was endearing, but you knew better than to be a distraction and vice versa.\r</p><p>But basically you thought it was cute.\r</p><p><i>Ma cherie,\r</i></p><p><i>I really do hope I&rsquo;m not keeping you from your OWLs. No matter how smart you think you are&mdash;and talented, and skilled, and charming&mdash;do not fail Slytherin. Please do this for our House, for me.\r</i></p><p><i>Really? A celebrity? Sounds like a bad fad. Don&rsquo;t tell me Slytherin&rsquo;s gone soft now that I&rsquo;ve left. If it has, Hufflepuff may have doubled its badgers.\r</i></p><p><i>And please never ever say &lsquo;Snape-y&rsquo; again.\r</i></p><p><i>Also, you mean Charles Weasley, right? I don&rsquo;t know what to say. There&rsquo;s so few of us to reference our skills and credentials. I&rsquo;m telling you that both Harris and Giorgio are far different from each other and from me.\r</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m glad to hear you like the gift. The nearest village I purchased it from is not near at all and that was the best thing I could find there. If you plan to wear it that much, you might not get any studying done at all!\r</i></p><p><i>I do wish I could see it on you though.\r</i></p><p><i>Yours,\r</i></p><p><i>Felix</i>\r</p><p><i>PS. More than an embrace? Very tempting.\r</i></p><p>Your cheeks turned so scarlet that your face could have been mistaken for a Gryffindor banner. Your stomach felt like the first time you did a Loop the Loop in Flying class and you tried your damnedest to hold it in. Your friends didn&rsquo;t seem to read the excitement you hid inside as you re-joined their study table.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the book&hellip;?&rdquo; Rowan Khanna asked. You volunteered earlier to search for some reference material for brewing liquid luck in one of the library aisles, only to return empty-handed.\r</p><p>Of all the damned things to remind you, steeling you from studying! <i>Felix</i> Felicis!\r</p><p>You swore sibilantly, remembering. Madam Pince shushed you from several rows away. (Barnaby Lee once commented that Madam Pince must have been part elephant, considering how powerful her hearing must be. That was, until Penny Haywood slapped the back of his head to correct his analogy.)\r</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; you said, feigning a groan. &ldquo;All this studying&rsquo;s draining my head&hellip;&rdquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a break soon, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Rowan said, then addressed the Ravenclaw. &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s looking rather pointless for you to defend, Andre.&rdquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, Khanna, Felixempra is done left to right!&rdquo; argued Andre Egwu.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Who draws a figure eight like that? It doesn&rsquo;t matter! Even if you ask Zygmunt Budge, you could easily ruin a perfectly brewed batch of Felix Felicis!&rdquo;\r</p><p>Andre threw his hands up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what else to tell you, Rowan. I read what I read and I will stand by it. Felixempra: left to right.&rdquo;\r</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see that book then,&rdquo; grumbled your best friend.\r</p><p>As you walked away, you couldn&rsquo;t help but conceal a smile from hearing Felix&rsquo;s name being spoken again and again.\r</p><p>Damn it. Stop blushing so much.</p></p>",
