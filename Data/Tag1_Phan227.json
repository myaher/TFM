Being able to engage with his audience in real time allowed him to immerse himself into his YouTube persona and practice letting it flow more naturally.

Asking for a friend. Your friend. Me.\u201d</p><p>Phil bristled at his remark, holding his phone out of Dan\u2019s line of vision protectively. \u201cShe works during the day, Dan. Not everyone operates on a YouTube schedule,\u201d he huffed, \u201cI see her in the day sometimes too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried she\u2019s only using you for your hot bod,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he laughed, throwing a napkin at him.</p><p><b>5/16/12 \u2013 1:18 PM</b></p><p>Dan was straining slightly as he hauled several full shopping bags into the apartment. \u201cThey were out of the biscuits that you like, so I\u2014\u201d he stopped short, startled, and nearly dropped his grocery haul. \u201cJesus Christ, Phil!\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Phil had made an offhand remark about Charlotte coming over that afternoon, and Dan hadn\u2019t thought twice about it. What he did not anticipate, however, was to walk in on the pair mid-fellatio. While Charlotte still had her panties on, Phil was completely naked and sprawled out shamelessly on the sofa. She shot up, startled and covered her breasts with her arm, but he seemed to have a bit of a delayed reaction, though he did offer an emphatic \u201cI\u2019m sorry! We just\u2026got caught up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you just got \u2018caught up\u2019 did you?\u201d Dan rolled his eyes, unceremoniously dropping the bags on the breakfast bar. \u201cYou knew I wasn\u2019t going to be gone for long!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think I was hoping you\u2019d catch me like some weird voyeur?\u201d it was at that point they both noticed that Dan hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off them since he\u2019d spotted them, cheeks turning red and gaze quickly shifting to the floor.</p><p>Charlotte noticed it as well, but might have interpreted it differently. \u201cYou can join us if you want, Dan.\u201d</p><p>This completely caught Dan off guard, standing in stunned silence for a solid couple moments. \u201cI-I uh\u2026am going to have to pass, thank you,\u201d he finally got out, shaking his head. \u201cBut that\u2019s a, uh, nice setup you\u2019ve got there,\u201d he said in reference to her body, then visibly cringed at how awful that must have sounded, and promptly left to his room.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say that to him?\u201d Phil asked when they were alone, having been nearly as shocked as the other male at her offer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d have been hot,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve gotten the vibe that you\u2019re kind of into him. It\u2019s okay, my ex-boyfriend was bi too.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t occurred to Phil that his feelings for Dan had been obvious enough for someone else to pick up on, especially someone he was dating. He started to think the focus on distancing themselves online might not be a bad idea \u2013 the fans studied their interactions more than anyone else. If nothing else, it was in their best interests to keep up the \u2018mutual friend\u2019 story as their meeting origin. \u201cNext time, I\u2019d rather you run that sort of thing by me, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I put you in an awkward position,\u201d she told him, and as far as he could tell, she meant it.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2026want to pick back up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno if the mood\u2019s still there, babe,\u201d she chuckled, gesturing to Phil\u2019s now flaccid cock.</p><p>So, they spent the rest of the afternoon watching movies. Charlotte left around seven to work the night shift at Starbucks, leaving Dan and Phil in the wake of the earlier exchange. Phil decided it would be worse to ignore it than to clear the air and face whatever awkward confrontation followed. \u201cDan? Can we talk for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your cock still out?\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes and let himself into Dan\u2019s room. \u201cNot unless you want it to be,\u201d he retorted, sitting down on the bed and waiting for him to turn to face him. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I couldn\u2019t get it back up after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does make me feel a bit better, yes,\u201d Dan said, spinning away from his computer screen. \u201cAre you still going to try to get me to believe that you \u2018forgot\u2019 that I only went to Tesco\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>There were a few minutes of silence as Phil tried to figure out how to explain his actions. He did know that there was a high probability of being caught from the moment things started to get hot and heavy, but he wasn\u2019t sure what compelled him to follow through. Was he jealous? Angry? Spiteful? Maybe he was just that horny. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget,\u201d he finally confessed, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know why I did it, and I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s expression was somewhere between disbelief and amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking weird, Phil,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cIf this is a new kink for you, at least give me a bit of a warning next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten over the shock yet, quite frankly. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll just be able to repress it and it\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled, patting Dan on the shoulder as he got up to leave. \u201cWhatever works.\u201d</p><p><b>5/22/12 \u2013 9:32 AM</b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think this is somewhat of a coping mechanism for you,\u201d PJ remarked as Dan climbed into the passenger seat of his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you need to mind your business,\u201d Dan retorted with a dry laugh. It was the fourth time in the past week or so that PJ picked him up from a one-night-stand\u2019s place to drop him off back at his flat. They had even started making detours for breakfast, making a morning out of saving him from a walk of shame.</p><p>They walked into the diner and sat in the booth, Dan turning to check his phone. There was no shortage of messages \u2013 ones from OkCupid, texts from past and potentially future partners, but none from Phil \u2013 and Dan seemed bothered by that. \u201cI could be dead, you know. You\u2019d think he would check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you\u2019re with me,\u201d PJ reminded him. \u201cSo, there\u2019s only like, a forty percent chance you could be dead.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came to them a few moments later, and throughout their meal, her attempts at flirtation were far from subtle, but Dan hardly acknowledged it, let alone reciprocated. This caused PJ to look at him in surprise, but waited until they were alone again before he voiced his feelings. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely gorgeous, Dan. Are you sick or something?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, picking at the food he had barely touched. \u201cI\u2019m too tired, Peej. I think I\u2019ve actually managed to reach my threshold on the amount of casual sex I can have. It\u2019s not making me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you hoping to feel?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips, strumming his fingers against the table. \u201cGuess I\u2019m trying not to feel anything. As long as I\u2019ve got a warm body next to me, I don\u2019t have to be alone with my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to worry about you, Dan,\u201d he frowned as they took care of the bill.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, getting up and shoving his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cGet in line.\u201d</p><p><b>5/27/12 \u2013 3:12 PM</b></p><p>Yesterday had been a positive one for Dan and Phil. They had spent time with a friend and her baby, and it left them both in a good mood, a welcome change in energy. \u201cI\u2019m feeling quite broody now honestly,\u201d Dan admitted. They were sat in the lounge \u2013 Dan in his chair and Phil on the couch, both with their laptops out. \u201cTell me that wasn\u2019t one of the cutest babies you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled fondly. \u201cShe\u2019s adorable. I can\u2019t wait to have kids\u2026maybe when I\u2019m confident that I won\u2019t drop it,\u201d he mused with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you keep a fish alive before you even try to fathom having a child. Hell, keep a plant going for a while and I\u2019ll be impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no faith in me,\u201d Phil huffed. He looked up from his laptop and watched Dan for a moment, suddenly feeling a pang of sadness. Not too long ago, he was certain that their future held that \u2013 marriage, kids, a house in the suburbs with a yard big enough for a dog to run around in. But everything felt uncertain now. As much as he kept reminding himself that their break was temporary, he feared things would never be the same when they picked back up, that they would never be able to love each other as much as they did when they first fell.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he must have gotten lost in thought, realizing he was now looking Dan right in the eyes, and could see the concern in his expression. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Just\u2026sad that I may never be coordinated enough to care for a child full time,\u201d he forced a laugh with that.</p><p>Dan hesitated to believe Phil, even if he wanted to. He immediately felt guilty, despite not having a reason to, for once. \u201cI don\u2019t like that face. It was too sad. Don\u2019t do it again,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>A small but sincere smile settled on Phil\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he promised.</p><p><b>5/31/12 \u2013 6:54 PM</b></p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to stay here? I think I\u2019ll be okay on my own for a few hours,\u201d Dan was laying in bed, tucked in tightly and sounding weak despite his best efforts to hide it.</p><p>Phil nodded, sitting beside Dan and gently running his fingers through his hair. He and Charlotte had originally planned to see The Chernobyl Diaries on her day off, but when Dan\u2019s complaints of stomach pain developed into a full-blown virus, Phil dropped his plans to tend to him. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Dan started to sit up, but Phil immediately made him lay back down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuck up your night over a tummy ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, shut up,\u201d he said with gentle affection. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay and help you feel better and that\u2019s the end of it. Now stay put while I go make you some tea.\u201d</p><p>After Phil left, Dan noticed his phone had fallen out of his pocket and on to the bed. Unable to help himself, he glanced at the home screen and saw the most recent text from Charlotte. It read \u2018I hope you don\u2019t have to take him to A&amp;E, this is the third time he\u2019s gotten sick on your watch\u2019. He furrowed his brows \u2013 this had been the only time he had fallen ill this year.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s where I left it,\u201d he remarked when he returned to Dan\u2019s room, setting the mug down on the end table.</p><p>\u201cWhy does Charlotte think I\u2019ve gotten sick three times?\u201d he would deal with the repercussions of peeping on his phone later, he was more concerned with getting answers.</p><p>Phil furrowed his brows and picked up his phone, reading the same message. He chewed on his lip as he slid his phone into his pocket. \u201cThere may have been a couple incidents where I wanted to stay home after having already made plans, so I said I needed to look after you. Maybe I jinxed you so, uh, sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say <i>you\u2019re</i> sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause then she might\u2019ve come over here instead.\u201d</p><p>Dan sat up to take a sip of tea, looking at Phil with a bemused grin. \u201cPhil, you can\u2019t keep hiding from your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked unsettled at the label and felt his stomach tighten. \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious, it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assured, shifting to sit more comfortably on the bed and set the mug down when Dan was done. To his surprise, he cuddled up to him and rest his head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so good to me. I don\u2019t deserve it at all.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around the younger male. \u201cMaybe not, but that\u2019s never stopped me before.\u201d</p>",

Charlotte left around seven to work the night shift at Starbucks, leaving Dan and Phil in the wake of the earlier exchange. Phil decided it would be worse to ignore it than to clear the air and face whatever awkward confrontation followed. \u201cDan? Can we talk for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your cock still out?\u201d</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes and let himself into Dan\u2019s room. \u201cNot unless you want it to be,\u201d he retorted, sitting down on the bed and waiting for him to turn to face him. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I couldn\u2019t get it back up after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does make me feel a bit better, yes,\u201d Dan said, spinning away from his computer screen. \u201cAre you still going to try to get me to believe that you \u2018forgot\u2019 that I only went to Tesco\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>There were a few minutes of silence as Phil tried to figure out how to explain his actions. He did know that there was a high probability of being caught from the moment things started to get hot and heavy, but he wasn\u2019t sure what compelled him to follow through. Was he jealous? Angry? Spiteful? Maybe he was just that horny. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget,\u201d he finally confessed, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know why I did it, and I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s expression was somewhere between disbelief and amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking weird, Phil,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cIf this is a new kink for you, at least give me a bit of a warning next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten over the shock yet, quite frankly. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll just be able to repress it and it\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled, patting Dan on the shoulder as he got up to leave. \u201cWhatever works.\u201d</p><p><b>5/22/12 \u2013 9:32 AM</b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think this is somewhat of a coping mechanism for you,\u201d PJ remarked as Dan climbed into the passenger seat of his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you need to mind your business,\u201d Dan retorted with a dry laugh. It was the fourth time in the past week or so that PJ picked him up from a one-night-stand\u2019s place to drop him off back at his flat. They had even started making detours for breakfast, making a morning out of saving him from a walk of shame.</p><p>They walked into the diner and sat in the booth, Dan turning to check his phone. There was no shortage of messages \u2013 ones from OkCupid, texts from past and potentially future partners, but none from Phil \u2013 and Dan seemed bothered by that. \u201cI could be dead, you know. You\u2019d think he would check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you\u2019re with me,\u201d PJ reminded him. \u201cSo, there\u2019s only like, a forty percent chance you could be dead.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came to them a few moments later, and throughout their meal, her attempts at flirtation were far from subtle, but Dan hardly acknowledged it, let alone reciprocated. This caused PJ to look at him in surprise, but waited until they were alone again before he voiced his feelings. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely gorgeous, Dan. Are you sick or something?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, picking at the food he had barely touched. \u201cI\u2019m too tired, Peej. I think I\u2019ve actually managed to reach my threshold on the amount of casual sex I can have. It\u2019s not making me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you hoping to feel?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips, strumming his fingers against the table. \u201cGuess I\u2019m trying not to feel anything. As long as I\u2019ve got a warm body next to me, I don\u2019t have to be alone with my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to worry about you, Dan,\u201d he frowned as they took care of the bill.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, getting up and shoving his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cGet in line.\u201d</p><p><b>5/27/12 \u2013 3:12 PM</b></p><p>Yesterday had been a positive one for Dan and Phil. They had spent time with a friend and her baby, and it left them both in a good mood, a welcome change in energy. \u201cI\u2019m feeling quite broody now honestly,\u201d Dan admitted. They were sat in the lounge \u2013 Dan in his chair and Phil on the couch, both with their laptops out. \u201cTell me that wasn\u2019t one of the cutest babies you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled fondly. \u201cShe\u2019s adorable. I can\u2019t wait to have kids\u2026maybe when I\u2019m confident that I won\u2019t drop it,\u201d he mused with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you keep a fish alive before you even try to fathom having a child. Hell, keep a plant going for a while and I\u2019ll be impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no faith in me,\u201d Phil huffed. He looked up from his laptop and watched Dan for a moment, suddenly feeling a pang of sadness. Not too long ago, he was certain that their future held that \u2013 marriage, kids, a house in the suburbs with a yard big enough for a dog to run around in. But everything felt uncertain now. As much as he kept reminding himself that their break was temporary, he feared things would never be the same when they picked back up, that they would never be able to love each other as much as they did when they first fell.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he must have gotten lost in thought, realizing he was now looking Dan right in the eyes, and could see the concern in his expression. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Just\u2026sad that I may never be coordinated enough to care for a child full time,\u201d he forced a laugh with that.</p><p>Dan hesitated to believe Phil, even if he wanted to. He immediately felt guilty, despite not having a reason to, for once. \u201cI don\u2019t like that face. It was too sad. Don\u2019t do it again,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>A small but sincere smile settled on Phil\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he promised.</p><p><b>5/31/12 \u2013 6:54 PM</b></p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to stay here? I think I\u2019ll be okay on my own for a few hours,\u201d Dan was laying in bed, tucked in tightly and sounding weak despite his best efforts to hide it.</p><p>Phil nodded, sitting beside Dan and gently running his fingers through his hair. He and Charlotte had originally planned to see The Chernobyl Diaries on her day off, but when Dan\u2019s complaints of stomach pain developed into a full-blown virus, Phil dropped his plans to tend to him. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Dan started to sit up, but Phil immediately made him lay back down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuck up your night over a tummy ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, shut up,\u201d he said with gentle affection. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay and help you feel better and that\u2019s the end of it. Now stay put while I go make you some tea.\u201d</p><p>After Phil left, Dan noticed his phone had fallen out of his pocket and on to the bed. Unable to help himself, he glanced at the home screen and saw the most recent text from Charlotte. It read \u2018I hope you don\u2019t have to take him to A&amp;E, this is the third time he\u2019s gotten sick on your watch\u2019. He furrowed his brows \u2013 this had been the only time he had fallen ill this year.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s where I left it,\u201d he remarked when he returned to Dan\u2019s room, setting the mug down on the end table.</p><p>\u201cWhy does Charlotte think I\u2019ve gotten sick three times?\u201d he would deal with the repercussions of peeping on his phone later, he was more concerned with getting answers.</p><p>Phil furrowed his brows and picked up his phone, reading the same message. He chewed on his lip as he slid his phone into his pocket. \u201cThere may have been a couple incidents where I wanted to stay home after having already made plans, so I said I needed to look after you. Maybe I jinxed you so, uh, sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say <i>you\u2019re</i> sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause then she might\u2019ve come over here instead.\u201d</p><p>Dan sat up to take a sip of tea, looking at Phil with a bemused grin. \u201cPhil, you can\u2019t keep hiding from your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked unsettled at the label and felt his stomach tighten. \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious, it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assured, shifting to sit more comfortably on the bed and set the mug down when Dan was done. To his surprise, he cuddled up to him and rest his head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so good to me. I don\u2019t deserve it at all.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around the younger male. \u201cMaybe not, but that\u2019s never stopped me before.\u201d</p></p>",

Maybe he was just that horny. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget,\u201d he finally confessed, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know why I did it, and I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s expression was somewhere between disbelief and amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking weird, Phil,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cIf this is a new kink for you, at least give me a bit of a warning next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten over the shock yet, quite frankly. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll just be able to repress it and it\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled, patting Dan on the shoulder as he got up to leave. \u201cWhatever works.\u201d</p><p><b>5/22/12 \u2013 9:32 AM</b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think this is somewhat of a coping mechanism for you,\u201d PJ remarked as Dan climbed into the passenger seat of his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you need to mind your business,\u201d Dan retorted with a dry laugh. It was the fourth time in the past week or so that PJ picked him up from a one-night-stand\u2019s place to drop him off back at his flat. They had even started making detours for breakfast, making a morning out of saving him from a walk of shame.</p><p>They walked into the diner and sat in the booth, Dan turning to check his phone. There was no shortage of messages \u2013 ones from OkCupid, texts from past and potentially future partners, but none from Phil \u2013 and Dan seemed bothered by that. \u201cI could be dead, you know. You\u2019d think he would check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you\u2019re with me,\u201d PJ reminded him. \u201cSo, there\u2019s only like, a forty percent chance you could be dead.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came to them a few moments later, and throughout their meal, her attempts at flirtation were far from subtle, but Dan hardly acknowledged it, let alone reciprocated. This caused PJ to look at him in surprise, but waited until they were alone again before he voiced his feelings. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely gorgeous, Dan. Are you sick or something?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, picking at the food he had barely touched. \u201cI\u2019m too tired, Peej. I think I\u2019ve actually managed to reach my threshold on the amount of casual sex I can have. It\u2019s not making me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you hoping to feel?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips, strumming his fingers against the table. \u201cGuess I\u2019m trying not to feel anything. As long as I\u2019ve got a warm body next to me, I don\u2019t have to be alone with my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to worry about you, Dan,\u201d he frowned as they took care of the bill.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, getting up and shoving his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cGet in line.\u201d</p><p><b>5/27/12 \u2013 3:12 PM</b></p><p>Yesterday had been a positive one for Dan and Phil. They had spent time with a friend and her baby, and it left them both in a good mood, a welcome change in energy. \u201cI\u2019m feeling quite broody now honestly,\u201d Dan admitted. They were sat in the lounge \u2013 Dan in his chair and Phil on the couch, both with their laptops out. \u201cTell me that wasn\u2019t one of the cutest babies you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiled fondly. \u201cShe\u2019s adorable. I can\u2019t wait to have kids\u2026maybe when I\u2019m confident that I won\u2019t drop it,\u201d he mused with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you keep a fish alive before you even try to fathom having a child. Hell, keep a plant going for a while and I\u2019ll be impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no faith in me,\u201d Phil huffed. He looked up from his laptop and watched Dan for a moment, suddenly feeling a pang of sadness. Not too long ago, he was certain that their future held that \u2013 marriage, kids, a house in the suburbs with a yard big enough for a dog to run around in. But everything felt uncertain now. As much as he kept reminding himself that their break was temporary, he feared things would never be the same when they picked back up, that they would never be able to love each other as much as they did when they first fell.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he must have gotten lost in thought, realizing he was now looking Dan right in the eyes, and could see the concern in his expression. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Just\u2026sad that I may never be coordinated enough to care for a child full time,\u201d he forced a laugh with that.</p><p>Dan hesitated to believe Phil, even if he wanted to. He immediately felt guilty, despite not having a reason to, for once. \u201cI don\u2019t like that face. It was too sad. Don\u2019t do it again,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>A small but sincere smile settled on Phil\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d he promised.</p><p><b>5/31/12 \u2013 6:54 PM</b></p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to stay here? I think I\u2019ll be okay on my own for a few hours,\u201d Dan was laying in bed, tucked in tightly and sounding weak despite his best efforts to hide it.</p><p>Phil nodded, sitting beside Dan and gently running his fingers through his hair. He and Charlotte had originally planned to see The Chernobyl Diaries on her day off, but when Dan\u2019s complaints of stomach pain developed into a full-blown virus, Phil dropped his plans to tend to him. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Dan started to sit up, but Phil immediately made him lay back down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuck up your night over a tummy ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, shut up,\u201d he said with gentle affection. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay and help you feel better and that\u2019s the end of it. Now stay put while I go make you some tea.\u201d</p><p>After Phil left, Dan noticed his phone had fallen out of his pocket and on to the bed. Unable to help himself, he glanced at the home screen and saw the most recent text from Charlotte. It read \u2018I hope you don\u2019t have to take him to A&amp;E, this is the third time he\u2019s gotten sick on your watch\u2019. He furrowed his brows \u2013 this had been the only time he had fallen ill this year.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s where I left it,\u201d he remarked when he returned to Dan\u2019s room, setting the mug down on the end table.</p><p>\u201cWhy does Charlotte think I\u2019ve gotten sick three times?\u201d he would deal with the repercussions of peeping on his phone later, he was more concerned with getting answers.</p><p>Phil furrowed his brows and picked up his phone, reading the same message. He chewed on his lip as he slid his phone into his pocket. \u201cThere may have been a couple incidents where I wanted to stay home after having already made plans, so I said I needed to look after you. Maybe I jinxed you so, uh, sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say <i>you\u2019re</i> sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause then she might\u2019ve come over here instead.\u201d</p><p>Dan sat up to take a sip of tea, looking at Phil with a bemused grin. \u201cPhil, you can\u2019t keep hiding from your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked unsettled at the label and felt his stomach tighten. \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious, it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assured, shifting to sit more comfortably on the bed and set the mug down when Dan was done. To his surprise, he cuddled up to him and rest his head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so good to me. I don\u2019t deserve it at all.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around the younger male. \u201cMaybe not, but that\u2019s never stopped me before.\u201d</p></p>",

Being able to engage with his audience in real time allowed him to immerse himself into his YouTube persona and practice letting it flow more naturally. Or, in other words, he could cover his and Dan&rsquo;s asses the way the other had been urging him to. And so began the lie of &lsquo;we met through a mutual friend&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s still something they could fact check,&rdquo; Phil remarked over dinner.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but who&rsquo;s gonna be that concerned with it?&rdquo; Dan shrugged between bites. &ldquo;I do appreciate you helping the cause, so to speak.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it calms your paranoid ass, it&rsquo;s a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take,&rdquo; he chuckled, shaking his head before the buzzing of his phone stole his attention away.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Does she ever text you during daylight hours? Asking for a friend. Your friend. Me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil bristled at his remark, holding his phone out of Dan&rsquo;s line of vision protectively. &ldquo;She works during the day, Dan. Not everyone operates on a YouTube schedule,&rdquo; he huffed, &ldquo;I see her in the day sometimes too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just worried she&rsquo;s only using you for your hot bod,&rdquo; he teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; he laughed, throwing a napkin at him.</p><p><b>5/16/12 &ndash; 1:18 PM</b></p><p>Dan was straining slightly as he hauled several full shopping bags into the apartment. &ldquo;They were out of the biscuits that you like, so I&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped short, startled, and nearly dropped his grocery haul. &ldquo;Jesus Christ, Phil!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil had made an offhand remark about Charlotte coming over that afternoon, and Dan hadn&rsquo;t thought twice about it. What he did not anticipate, however, was to walk in on the pair mid-fellatio. While Charlotte still had her panties on, Phil was completely naked and sprawled out shamelessly on the sofa. She shot up, startled and covered her breasts with her arm, but he seemed to have a bit of a delayed reaction, though he did offer an emphatic &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! We just&hellip;got caught up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you just got &lsquo;caught up&rsquo; did you?&rdquo; Dan rolled his eyes, unceremoniously dropping the bags on the breakfast bar. &ldquo;You knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to be gone for long!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, you think I was hoping you&rsquo;d catch me like some weird voyeur?&rdquo; it was at that point they both noticed that Dan hadn&rsquo;t taken his eyes off them since he&rsquo;d spotted them, cheeks turning red and gaze quickly shifting to the floor.</p><p>Charlotte noticed it as well, but might have interpreted it differently. &ldquo;You can join us if you want, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>This completely caught Dan off guard, standing in stunned silence for a solid couple moments. &ldquo;I-I uh&hellip;am going to have to pass, thank you,&rdquo; he finally got out, shaking his head. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a, uh, nice setup you&rsquo;ve got there,&rdquo; he said in reference to her body, then visibly cringed at how awful that must have sounded, and promptly left to his room.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you say that to him?&rdquo; Phil asked when they were alone, having been nearly as shocked as the other male at her offer.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d have been hot,&rdquo; she shrugged. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;ve gotten the vibe that you&rsquo;re kind of into him. It&rsquo;s okay, my ex-boyfriend was bi too.&rdquo;</p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t occurred to Phil that his feelings for Dan had been obvious enough for someone else to pick up on, especially someone he was dating. He started to think the focus on distancing themselves online might not be a bad idea &ndash; the fans studied their interactions more than anyone else. If nothing else, it was in their best interests to keep up the &lsquo;mutual friend&rsquo; story as their meeting origin. &ldquo;Next time, I&rsquo;d rather you run that sort of thing by me, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Charlotte nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I put you in an awkward position,&rdquo; she told him, and as far as he could tell, she meant it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you&hellip;want to pick back up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dunno if the mood&rsquo;s still there, babe,&rdquo; she chuckled, gesturing to Phil&rsquo;s now flaccid cock.</p><p>So, they spent the rest of the afternoon watching movies. Charlotte left around seven to work the night shift at Starbucks, leaving Dan and Phil in the wake of the earlier exchange. Phil decided it would be worse to ignore it than to clear the air and face whatever awkward confrontation followed. &ldquo;Dan? Can we talk for a minute?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is your cock still out?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil rolled his eyes and let himself into Dan&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;Not unless you want it to be,&rdquo; he retorted, sitting down on the bed and waiting for him to turn to face him. &ldquo;If it makes you feel any better, I couldn&rsquo;t get it back up after you left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That does make me feel a bit better, yes,&rdquo; Dan said, spinning away from his computer screen. &ldquo;Are you still going to try to get me to believe that you &lsquo;forgot&rsquo; that I only went to Tesco&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p><p>There were a few minutes of silence as Phil tried to figure out how to explain his actions.
