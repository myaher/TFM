And it still hurts.\u00a0</p><p>A lot can be accomplished in the time span of eleven weeks, and you are a prime example of how that is possible. In the past two and a half months you\u2019ve done a lot, and you are extremely proud of yourself for it.\u00a0</p><p>Of all the positive things you\u2019ve been doing for yourself lately, there however has\u00a0been one constant negative you\u2019ve been doing that\u2019s slowly eating away at you; and that\u2019s been avoiding Harry.\u00a0</p><p>Every week for the past eleven weeks without fail, Harry has texted you; but not in an overbearing way. After the first seven days of being broken up his calls and texts slowly became less frequent, and it was completely understandable as to why seeing as the man was on a world tour. After that he\u2019d call once a week, but was quick picking up on how you more than likely weren\u2019t going to answer just like all the other times. Which has resulted in the weekly text messages.\u00a0</p><p>In every message, he gives you an update on his life, what he\u2019s spent the last week doing, and concludes the message with asking how you are;\u00a0which you are extremely grateful for. You\u2019ve gotten some peace of mind from these messages, as you know that at least he\u2019s doing ok; and that\u2019s all that matters to you.</p><p>However, you haven\u2019t responded to a single one of those texts or calls. Not to spite him in the slightest bit, but rather because he\u2019s been out there living his best life, and you feel talking about yourself will take away from that.</p><p>Despite the feeling of you bringing Harry down, and not having the guts to answer him; you\u2019ve kept in contact with Anne and Gemma, seeing as you\u2019d grown quite close to both women over the duration of your relationship with Harry. You and Gemma have continued your tradition of weekly coffee dates that began shortly after the two of you met; which is what you\u2019re doing currenlty.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOrder for Y/N,\u201d the Starbucks barista calls out, and slides two cups towards you on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you tell her with a smile as you take the drinks. You turn around and walk over to Gemma sitting in a table over in the corner of the store.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI feel that you\u2019re lying about me buying our coffee\u2019s last week,\u201d she states when you hand her one of the drinks, and sit down across from her.\u00a0\u201cYup you definitely are, stop scamming my turns of buying for us from me, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d catch on,\u201d you mutter; earning yourself an eyeroll from your ex\u2019s sister, but also one of your closest friends.</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d she responds and smirks as she sips her latte.\u00a0\u201cSo what\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much actually,\u201d you tell her honestly.\u00a0\u201cJust the usual. If I\u2019m not at school, I\u2019m at work, and vise versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re living the dream,\u201d she chuckles, as do you.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s dream maybe, not necessarily mine,\u201d you answer and send her a wink.\u00a0\u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing&hellip; well minus the school part, but just work,\u201d she explains, and you nod in understanding. Without another word; you glance outside at the rainy September weather as it pours into the streets of London, and sigh.\u00a0\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh nothing,\u201d you ramble, and look back to her.\u00a0\u201cSorry, my mind has all over the place the past couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask what it is causing that?\u201d She questions, causing you to look at her with a slightly confused expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing important,\u201d you say dissmisively, and she scoffs.</p><p>\u201cSo it has nothing to do with my brother being back in London, is what you\u2019re saying, right?\u201d She challenges with a smirk, and your mouth falls open.</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d you stutter as you try to cover up your reaction.\u00a0\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of it,\u201d she states, and you let out another sigh. Silence falls over the two of you, and your eyes slowly drift to look out the window again.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s ok to miss him, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you whisper without looking at her.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t even express how much I miss him, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m really happy for him, Gem. He\u2019s doing just fine without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you so sure, hmm? Did he tell you that?\u201d She questions, and you shake your head no.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t given him the chance too,\u201d you mutter in response.\u00a0\u201cI just know he\u2019s ok, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re greatly incorrect about him being ok without you Y/N,\u201d she tells you, but you shrug it off.</p><p>You slowly move your gaze back to meet her\u2019s, and start feeling guilty all over again. Maybe Harry does miss you, but you feel not being together is what he needs. Originally it was what you thought you needed, but the past two and a half months have proven that you were so wrong about that. You need Harry in your life, but aren\u2019t\u00a0selfish enough to put your needs before what you think are his.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore, we\u2019re not together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Y/N,\u201d she says and shakes her head dissaprovingly.\u00a0\u201cMy brother really is the only one who&rsquo;s able to get through to you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d You just shrug again, and shake your head as your gaze moves to the ground before she speaks p again.\u00a0\u201cHe has a show tomorrow night, at the O2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d you tell her.\u00a0\u201cThe boys have like six shows there, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d she confirms, and takes another sip of her drink.\u00a0\u201cMum and I are going tomorrow night\u2019s show, and the night after. That one is the last one of the six and Harry left a few tickets aside&hellip; Come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Gemma I can\u2019t,\u201d you explain as you shake your head in protest.\u00a0\u201cI-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me some excuse, Y/N, I know you\u2019re free,\u201d she cuts you off and looks at you pointedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d you reply and put your hand on your chest, as if she\u2019s greatly offended you.\u00a0\u201cWhat makes you think I was going to come up with an excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you,\u201d she replys and leans down to pick her bag up off the ground.\u00a0\u201cListen, I can\u2019t make you go. But I know mum and I would both love having you there with us. I have to get to work though, but at least think about it, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d you tell her quietly, and nod.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later Gem. Have a good day at work.\u201d The two of you say your goodbyes, and you\u2019re left with your thoughts. You spend the next twenty minutes finishing your latte and watching the rain, before finally heading home for the night.\u00a0</p><p>&hellip; As soon as you got back to the loft last night and told your best friend about your talk with Gemma, she wouldn\u2019t shut up about how you should go to the concert; and finally getting over your stubborness, you sent Gemma a text saying you would join her and Anne to go to the show.\u00a0</p><p>So here you are, standing in front of your full length mirror; prepared to take off your fourth outfit, and try on another one. You leave your favourite ripped jeans on, and try on yet another top; but groan in frustration when it doesn\u2019t look as good as you thought it would.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with all the noises?\u201d Your best friends asks as she peaks her head in the doorway of your room.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find anything to wear,\u201d you grumble, and angrily pick up another top to try on.</p><p>\u201cOk drama queen,\u201d she says and steps more into the doorway a bit more, crossing her arms as she does so.\u00a0\u201cY/N, you literally look good in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incorrect,\u201d you tell her as you look at a long-sleeved, lace, burgundy top.\u00a0\u201cAnd I can\u2019t just look <i>good</i>, I need to look better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, how could I forget?\u201d She asks, and you snap your eyes to hers.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get your man back.\u201d Your gaze hardens, but she doesn\u2019t seem threatened as she starts laughing, and begins walking away.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m kidding, chill. But wear that top you\u2019re holding, it makes your boobs look good. And hurry, I think Anne and Gemma are here to pick you up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d you blurt out, and quickly throw the shirt on. You glance at yourself in the mirror, and are taken aback. Y/F/N was right; your boobs look great in this top, and you\u2019re totally feeling yourself in it. You quickly fix your hair to the way you originally styled it, and grab your favourite leather jacket before bolting out the door.</p><p>The concert is just about ready to start when you, Anne, and Gemma arrive to the arena. The three of you are quickly let into the private parking, and escorted to your seats along the catwalk.\u00a0</p><p>The fans around you start buzzing with excitement as everyone prepares for the boys to take the stage, and a couple of them are very observant; quickly picking up on that you are in the crowd with Harry\u2019s mum and sister, and subtly try take some pictures. Some look like they\u2019re debating on approaching the three of you, but don\u2019t as the lights turn off, and everyone goes nuts.\u00a0</p><p>Screams erupt from all over as the lights on the stage start flashing, and you find yourself cheering along with everyone else. A moment later, the boys are on the stage as they wave to the crowd, and start singing the first song.\u00a0</p><p>The four of them make their way around the stage as the song continues, and your eyes instantly fall on the long haired boy as he hits his notes perfectly. You&rsquo;re heart flutters, and it all hits you like a brick wall; just how much you\u2019ve missed him. He looks good, so effortlessly good, and it\u2019s hard to take your eyes off of him.\u00a0</p><p>Your gaze moves to Niall as he\u2019s going to pass you, Anne, and Gemma on the catwalk. He\u2019s laughing, and goes to high-five some fans; but then his line of sight meets yours, and his eyes widen. His smiles widens as well, while Liam walks towards him; singing into the mic. Niall swats his arm and points to you, causing Liam\u2019s eyes to widen as well. He smiles and waves, before looking forward again, and finishing his part of the song. Louis walks by next, and is quick noticing you due to Niall and Liams actions. He smiles, and nods at you; as well as greets fans, before continuing after the other two.</p><p>Lastly, Harry approaches. He sings another part of the song and moves it from his mouth, just as his eyes land on his mum and sister. He smiles at them, and his eyes move slightly; immediately connecting with yours, and widening. The look of total shock that takes over his features is extremely obvious, as he comes to a complete stop a few feet away from you. He looks away and back again, as if trying to make sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things; and soon realizes his eyes aren&rsquo;t playing tricks on him. You can\u2019t help but laugh a little bit as he shakes his head, and starts singing again. You send him a small wave as he walks by, and he doesn\u2019t take his eyes off of you until he\u2019s well past where you\u2019re seated.\u00a0</p><p>The majority of the concert plays out like it started. The four boys put on a phenomenal show, and the crowds reactions are proof of that. Whenever he could, Harry was locking his eyes with yours; like he was worried you were going to disappear, and your heart swelled each time.</p><p>Once the concert is over, and the boys have done their encore before leaving the stage; everyone starts departing. You just kind of stand there for a moment, unsure of what to do next. But then someone taps on your arm, and speaks up.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d Anne asks gently, and you look to her.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to go backstage to see Harry, would you like to come?\u201d</p><p>You look between her, and Gemma considering it; but decide not too.\u00a0\u201cUhm, no I think I\u2019m going to just head out actually,\u201d you tell her softly, and she frowns.\u00a0\u201cYou two go, he probably misses the two of you and is waiting to see you\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes for you, Y/N,\u201d Gemma adds.\u00a0\u201cWe all saw him watch you through that entire show, you should go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t think I will,\u201d you tell her, and she sighs in defeat. Without any more arguing, the two women hug you goodbye, and you make your way out of the arena.\u00a0</p><p>You walk a couple of blocks until it starts raining again&hellip; Surprise. The leather jacket you brought isn\u2019t much protection against the weather, so you eventually give up and wave down a cab. You\u2019re a fan of walking; it helps clear your mind, but you didn\u2019t get to do much thinking before the rain started, so unsuprisingly you\u2019re not thinking very straight when you give the driver Harry\u2019s address to drive you to rather than your own.\u00a0</p><p>It doesn\u2019t even register in your mind what you\u2019ve done until the driver takes a turn, and the all to familliar street Harry\u2019s apartment is on comes into view. Panic washes over you as the cab comes to a stop outside his building, and you\u2019re completely speechless. You mutter a thank you, and hand him the money for the ride; before climbing out of the vehicle, and wrapping your arms around your middle.</p><p>You stare up at the building, and tears begin filling your eyes. This place was home, but now it feels empty. All the memories of your times here with Harry seep into your mind, and it causes your tears to start pouring; although they\u2019d be invisible to someone passing by as they blend in extremely well with the pouring rain that also streams down your face.</p><p>With one final glance at the window you know to be Harry\u2019s bedroom, you shake your head and start walking down the street again; in search of another cab so you can go back to your loft.</p><p>The street is quiet, seeing as it is late; but a familiar flashing of an\u00a0\u2018<i>Open\u2019</i>\u00a0sign on a shop across the road catches your eye, and you find yourself migrating towards it. You reach the door and push it open, hearing the familiar ding that greets you everytime you enter your favourite shop.</p><p>The coffee shop is completely empty, and you stay standing at the door for a moment until the person you were wanting to see comes rushing out from the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear we\u2019re actually closing,\u201d Cheryl, the coffee shops owner calls as she wipes her hand on a rag. It takes her a moment to realize who it is standing there looking like a drenched rat, but when she does, her face lights right up.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d She asks and steps out from behind the counter.\u00a0\u201cOh my- are you ok, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve had a rough night,\u201d you blubber as a sob cracks your voice, and she rushes over to you.</p><p>\u201cWell come sit down then, I\u2019ll get you a hot chocolate,\u201d she states in a concered tone, and motions for you to follow her to the counter so she can make it.</p><p>You spend the next hour catching her up on what has happened over the past couple of months, as well as the events of tonight. She listens intently, and offers great advice on the entire matter; giving you a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from <a href=\"https://emotionally-imbruised.tumblr.com/post/177998865849/picture-this-january-1st\">January 1st</a> a couple of years ago, the day you first met this lovely woman.</p><p>She helped you out that day, was someone you and Harry would constantly visit when you\u2019s were together, and here she is offering you a shoulder to cry on as you sip on the amazing hot chocolate she made.</p><p>\u201cI think talking to him will help,\u201d she says and pats your hand gently.\u00a0\u201cWhether or not you\u2019s get back together, that\u2019s up to you\u2019s&hellip; But I think talking him will at least give you some closure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d you tell her.\u00a0\u201cI just- I ignored him this entire time, I would be suprised if he still wants anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she starts and narrows her gaze.\u00a0\u201cThat man has gone out of his way to message you every week for the past two months while he\u2019s on tour, I don\u2019t think him not wanting anything to do with you is a valid thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d you agree, and look down at your hands.\u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and sleep on it, and decide what I\u2019m going to do in the morning. Thank you for the hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime sweetheart,\u201d she insists with a smile.\u00a0\u201cYou know you and Harry are welcome here at anytime. Now you better be back soon though, no more of this staying away for over two months bull, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d you smile, and glance at the clock behind her reading 12:45am.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll let you get some sleep too, thanks again Cheryl. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and walks you to the door, giving you a hug just before you step out into the rain again. The door dings shut behind you, and you don\u2019t have it in you to even look at Harry\u2019s building again. You start down the street, but stop when a voice calls out; causing your breathe to hitch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d The voice asks, and you don\u2019t need to turn around to know that it\u2019s your ex-boyfriend. You turn around slowly just as the man in question shuts the door of a black car he\u2019s just climbed out of, and it drives away. He walks right up to you, and you feel as if his eyes are burning holes into your unexposed skin.</p><p>\u201cH-hey H,\u201d you stutter, as he pushes his long wet hair away from his face.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d He asks in a slightly harsh tone.\u00a0\u201cIs that really all you have to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what else <i>to</i> say,\u201d you continue stammering, as the tears start pouring again.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m embarressed, I\u2019m sad, and relieved to see you. I just-, no actually n-never-mind. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that, Y/N?\u201d He questions and steps forward again.\u00a0\u201cYou always <i>leave</i>. If you\u2019re face to face with something, why do you feel so inclined to just walk away rather than facing it head on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know, ok?\u201d You sob, and can see the tears in his eyes too.\u00a0\u201cIt just feels safer, and easier. I\u2019m less likely to get hurt if I leave, and not bother others with what\u2019s bothering me. It\u2019s my battles. I don\u2019t need to put them on anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can put them on me,\u201d he starts, and catches you off gaurd.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve always been able to come to me with your problems Y/N, and I\u2019m so sorry that I made it seem like you couldn\u2019t before all this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Harry, that wasn\u2019t you. It was m-,\u201d you try to reason, but he cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cIt <i>was</i> me,\u201d he states firmly.\u00a0\u201cI pushed you away by not letting you open up when you needed too. I was so selfish, and I hate myself for putting you through that. I\u2019ve been wanting to tell you that, but you haven\u2019t exactly made it easy or given me the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been ignoring you,\u201d you explain, and his green eyes begin to soften.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid. I just am so happy and proud to see you out there living your dream, I\u2019d hate myself if I ever got in the way of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never get in the way of that, Y/N. You\u2019re the one I want to share all of that with.\u201d He confesses, and you feel your heart beat quicken.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually ever told you that, but all those times where I\u2019ve said that you\u2019re it&hellip; I wasn\u2019t lying. There is no one else I want to do this life with, you\u2019re my everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH,\u201d you start, but he crushes his lips to yours to prevent you from any further arguments you don\u2019t mean. You respond immediately by moving your hands up, and tangling them into his long locks. The kiss is passionate, and longing on both ends. His tounge begs for access to your mouth, and you grant it; all while his arms snake around your waist to pull you closer too him, giving your butt a little squeeze. You slowly start pulling away, and meet his eyes before placing another peck onto his lips; and he leans his forehead agaisnt your\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I even have to tell you how badly I\u2019ve missed you?\u201d He asks sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t complain if you did,\u201d you say between chuckles, and push away your hair from your face.</p><p>\u201cHow about I show you instead?\u201d He suggests, and pulls your body against his.</p><p>\u201cEasy there tiger, that can wait a minute,\u201d you reply and pull him down for another passionate kiss. The two of you pull away again a moment later, and you look up to his eyes.\u00a0\u201cSo this mean we\u2019re back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere we ever not?\u201d He asks, and you furrow your eyebrows at him. He starts laughing before clearing his throat, and doing his best impression of Ross from Friends.\u00a0\u201cWE WERE ON A BREAK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much,\u201d you say between laughs as he pulls you in, and spins you around in the pouring rain.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a lie,\u201d he tells you, and links both of your hands together; slowly leading you back to his apartment building.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019glad to have you back, bub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d you agree, and lean your head against his shoulder as you\u2019s walk.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor far too long,\u201d he finishes the Nickelback lyric, and winks at you.\u00a0\u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to happen again, deal?\u201d You nod in agreement as you\u2019s approach the steps, and quickly glance back to where you\u2019s were standing; your mouth widening into a smile. Across the road is Cheryl in the coffee shop window waving, and smiling at the two of you\u2019s as she shuts off her sign; and you\u2019s disappear into the apartment to start your first long overdue night back together.</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>Picture This // Far Away</h1><p><i><b>\u201cI forgive you, for being away for far too long.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>Picture this: getting back together.</b></i> </p><p>Eleven weeks. And it still hurts.\u00a0</p><p>A lot can be accomplished in the time span of eleven weeks, and you are a prime example of how that is possible. In the past two and a half months you\u2019ve done a lot, and you are extremely proud of yourself for it.\u00a0</p><p>Of all the positive things you\u2019ve been doing for yourself lately, there however has\u00a0been one constant negative you\u2019ve been doing that\u2019s slowly eating away at you; and that\u2019s been avoiding Harry.\u00a0</p><p>Every week for the past eleven weeks without fail, Harry has texted you; but not in an overbearing way. After the first seven days of being broken up his calls and texts slowly became less frequent, and it was completely understandable as to why seeing as the man was on a world tour. After that he\u2019d call once a week, but was quick picking up on how you more than likely weren\u2019t going to answer just like all the other times. Which has resulted in the weekly text messages.\u00a0</p><p>In every message, he gives you an update on his life, what he\u2019s spent the last week doing, and concludes the message with asking how you are;\u00a0which you are extremely grateful for. You\u2019ve gotten some peace of mind from these messages, as you know that at least he\u2019s doing ok; and that\u2019s all that matters to you.</p><p>However, you haven\u2019t responded to a single one of those texts or calls. Not to spite him in the slightest bit, but rather because he\u2019s been out there living his best life, and you feel talking about yourself will take away from that.</p><p>Despite the feeling of you bringing Harry down, and not having the guts to answer him; you\u2019ve kept in contact with Anne and Gemma, seeing as you\u2019d grown quite close to both women over the duration of your relationship with Harry. You and Gemma have continued your tradition of weekly coffee dates that began shortly after the two of you met; which is what you\u2019re doing currenlty.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOrder for Y/N,\u201d the Starbucks barista calls out, and slides two cups towards you on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you tell her with a smile as you take the drinks. You turn around and walk over to Gemma sitting in a table over in the corner of the store.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI feel that you\u2019re lying about me buying our coffee\u2019s last week,\u201d she states when you hand her one of the drinks, and sit down across from her.\u00a0\u201cYup you definitely are, stop scamming my turns of buying for us from me, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d catch on,\u201d you mutter; earning yourself an eyeroll from your ex\u2019s sister, but also one of your closest friends.</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d she responds and smirks as she sips her latte.\u00a0\u201cSo what\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much actually,\u201d you tell her honestly.\u00a0\u201cJust the usual. If I\u2019m not at school, I\u2019m at work, and vise versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re living the dream,\u201d she chuckles, as do you.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s dream maybe, not necessarily mine,\u201d you answer and send her a wink.\u00a0\u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing\u2026 well minus the school part, but just work,\u201d she explains, and you nod in understanding. Without another word; you glance outside at the rainy September weather as it pours into the streets of London, and sigh.\u00a0\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh nothing,\u201d you ramble, and look back to her.\u00a0\u201cSorry, my mind has all over the place the past couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask what it is causing that?\u201d She questions, causing you to look at her with a slightly confused expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing important,\u201d you say dissmisively, and she scoffs.</p><p>\u201cSo it has nothing to do with my brother being back in London, is what you\u2019re saying, right?\u201d She challenges with a smirk, and your mouth falls open.</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d you stutter as you try to cover up your reaction.\u00a0\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of it,\u201d she states, and you let out another sigh. Silence falls over the two of you, and your eyes slowly drift to look out the window again.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s ok to miss him, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you whisper without looking at her.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t even express how much I miss him, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m really happy for him, Gem. He\u2019s doing just fine without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you so sure, hmm? Did he tell you that?\u201d She questions, and you shake your head no.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t given him the chance too,\u201d you mutter in response.\u00a0\u201cI just know he\u2019s ok, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re greatly incorrect about him being ok without you Y/N,\u201d she tells you, but you shrug it off.</p><p>You slowly move your gaze back to meet her\u2019s, and start feeling guilty all over again. Maybe Harry does miss you, but you feel not being together is what he needs. Originally it was what you thought you needed, but the past two and a half months have proven that you were so wrong about that. You need Harry in your life, but aren\u2019t\u00a0selfish enough to put your needs before what you think are his.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore, we\u2019re not together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Y/N,\u201d she says and shakes her head dissaprovingly.\u00a0\u201cMy brother really is the only one who\u2019s able to get through to you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d You just shrug again, and shake your head as your gaze moves to the ground before she speaks p again.\u00a0\u201cHe has a show tomorrow night, at the O2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d you tell her.\u00a0\u201cThe boys have like six shows there, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d she confirms, and takes another sip of her drink.\u00a0\u201cMum and I are going tomorrow night\u2019s show, and the night after. That one is the last one of the six and Harry left a few tickets aside\u2026 Come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Gemma I can\u2019t,\u201d you explain as you shake your head in protest.\u00a0\u201cI-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me some excuse, Y/N, I know you\u2019re free,\u201d she cuts you off and looks at you pointedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d you reply and put your hand on your chest, as if she\u2019s greatly offended you.\u00a0\u201cWhat makes you think I was going to come up with an excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you,\u201d she replys and leans down to pick her bag up off the ground.\u00a0\u201cListen, I can\u2019t make you go. But I know mum and I would both love having you there with us. I have to get to work though, but at least think about it, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d you tell her quietly, and nod.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later Gem. Have a good day at work.\u201d The two of you say your goodbyes, and you\u2019re left with your thoughts. You spend the next twenty minutes finishing your latte and watching the rain, before finally heading home for the night.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026 As soon as you got back to the loft last night and told your best friend about your talk with Gemma, she wouldn\u2019t shut up about how you should go to the concert; and finally getting over your stubborness, you sent Gemma a text saying you would join her and Anne to go to the show.\u00a0</p><p>So here you are, standing in front of your full length mirror; prepared to take off your fourth outfit, and try on another one. You leave your favourite ripped jeans on, and try on yet another top; but groan in frustration when it doesn\u2019t look as good as you thought it would.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with all the noises?\u201d Your best friends asks as she peaks her head in the doorway of your room.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find anything to wear,\u201d you grumble, and angrily pick up another top to try on.</p><p>\u201cOk drama queen,\u201d she says and steps more into the doorway a bit more, crossing her arms as she does so.\u00a0\u201cY/N, you literally look good in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incorrect,\u201d you tell her as you look at a long-sleeved, lace, burgundy top.\u00a0\u201cAnd I can\u2019t just look <i>good</i>, I need to look better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, how could I forget?\u201d She asks, and you snap your eyes to hers.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get your man back.\u201d Your gaze hardens, but she doesn\u2019t seem threatened as she starts laughing, and begins walking away.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m kidding, chill. But wear that top you\u2019re holding, it makes your boobs look good. And hurry, I think Anne and Gemma are here to pick you up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d you blurt out, and quickly throw the shirt on. You glance at yourself in the mirror, and are taken aback. Y/F/N was right; your boobs look great in this top, and you\u2019re totally feeling yourself in it. You quickly fix your hair to the way you originally styled it, and grab your favourite leather jacket before bolting out the door.</p><p>The concert is just about ready to start when you, Anne, and Gemma arrive to the arena. The three of you are quickly let into the private parking, and escorted to your seats along the catwalk.\u00a0</p><p>The fans around you start buzzing with excitement as everyone prepares for the boys to take the stage, and a couple of them are very observant; quickly picking up on that you are in the crowd with Harry\u2019s mum and sister, and subtly try take some pictures. Some look like they\u2019re debating on approaching the three of you, but don\u2019t as the lights turn off, and everyone goes nuts.\u00a0</p><p>Screams erupt from all over as the lights on the stage start flashing, and you find yourself cheering along with everyone else. A moment later, the boys are on the stage as they wave to the crowd, and start singing the first song.\u00a0</p><p>The four of them make their way around the stage as the song continues, and your eyes instantly fall on the long haired boy as he hits his notes perfectly. You\u2019re heart flutters, and it all hits you like a brick wall; just how much you\u2019ve missed him. He looks good, so effortlessly good, and it\u2019s hard to take your eyes off of him.\u00a0</p><p>Your gaze moves to Niall as he\u2019s going to pass you, Anne, and Gemma on the catwalk. He\u2019s laughing, and goes to high-five some fans; but then his line of sight meets yours, and his eyes widen. His smiles widens as well, while Liam walks towards him; singing into the mic. Niall swats his arm and points to you, causing Liam\u2019s eyes to widen as well. He smiles and waves, before looking forward again, and finishing his part of the song. Louis walks by next, and is quick noticing you due to Niall and Liams actions. He smiles, and nods at you; as well as greets fans, before continuing after the other two.</p><p>Lastly, Harry approaches. He sings another part of the song and moves it from his mouth, just as his eyes land on his mum and sister. He smiles at them, and his eyes move slightly; immediately connecting with yours, and widening. The look of total shock that takes over his features is extremely obvious, as he comes to a complete stop a few feet away from you. He looks away and back again, as if trying to make sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things; and soon realizes his eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on him. You can\u2019t help but laugh a little bit as he shakes his head, and starts singing again. You send him a small wave as he walks by, and he doesn\u2019t take his eyes off of you until he\u2019s well past where you\u2019re seated.\u00a0</p><p>The majority of the concert plays out like it started. The four boys put on a phenomenal show, and the crowds reactions are proof of that. Whenever he could, Harry was locking his eyes with yours; like he was worried you were going to disappear, and your heart swelled each time.</p><p>Once the concert is over, and the boys have done their encore before leaving the stage; everyone starts departing. You just kind of stand there for a moment, unsure of what to do next. But then someone taps on your arm, and speaks up.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d Anne asks gently, and you look to her.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to go backstage to see Harry, would you like to come?\u201d</p><p>You look between her, and Gemma considering it; but decide not too.\u00a0\u201cUhm, no I think I\u2019m going to just head out actually,\u201d you tell her softly, and she frowns.\u00a0\u201cYou two go, he probably misses the two of you and is waiting to see you\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes for you, Y/N,\u201d Gemma adds.\u00a0\u201cWe all saw him watch you through that entire show, you should go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t think I will,\u201d you tell her, and she sighs in defeat. Without any more arguing, the two women hug you goodbye, and you make your way out of the arena.\u00a0</p><p>You walk a couple of blocks until it starts raining again\u2026 Surprise. The leather jacket you brought isn\u2019t much protection against the weather, so you eventually give up and wave down a cab. You\u2019re a fan of walking; it helps clear your mind, but you didn\u2019t get to do much thinking before the rain started, so unsuprisingly you\u2019re not thinking very straight when you give the driver Harry\u2019s address to drive you to rather than your own.\u00a0</p><p>It doesn\u2019t even register in your mind what you\u2019ve done until the driver takes a turn, and the all to familliar street Harry\u2019s apartment is on comes into view. Panic washes over you as the cab comes to a stop outside his building, and you\u2019re completely speechless. You mutter a thank you, and hand him the money for the ride; before climbing out of the vehicle, and wrapping your arms around your middle.</p><p>You stare up at the building, and tears begin filling your eyes. This place was home, but now it feels empty. All the memories of your times here with Harry seep into your mind, and it causes your tears to start pouring; although they\u2019d be invisible to someone passing by as they blend in extremely well with the pouring rain that also streams down your face.</p><p>With one final glance at the window you know to be Harry\u2019s bedroom, you shake your head and start walking down the street again; in search of another cab so you can go back to your loft.</p><p>The street is quiet, seeing as it is late; but a familiar flashing of an\u00a0\u2018<i>Open\u2019</i>\u00a0sign on a shop across the road catches your eye, and you find yourself migrating towards it. You reach the door and push it open, hearing the familiar ding that greets you everytime you enter your favourite shop.</p><p>The coffee shop is completely empty, and you stay standing at the door for a moment until the person you were wanting to see comes rushing out from the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear we\u2019re actually closing,\u201d Cheryl, the coffee shops owner calls as she wipes her hand on a rag. It takes her a moment to realize who it is standing there looking like a drenched rat, but when she does, her face lights right up.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d She asks and steps out from behind the counter.\u00a0\u201cOh my- are you ok, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a rough night,\u201d you blubber as a sob cracks your voice, and she rushes over to you.</p><p>\u201cWell come sit down then, I\u2019ll get you a hot chocolate,\u201d she states in a concered tone, and motions for you to follow her to the counter so she can make it.</p><p>You spend the next hour catching her up on what has happened over the past couple of months, as well as the events of tonight. She listens intently, and offers great advice on the entire matter; giving you a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from <a href=\"https://emotionally-imbruised.tumblr.com/post/177998865849/picture-this-january-1st\">January 1st</a> a couple of years ago, the day you first met this lovely woman.</p><p>She helped you out that day, was someone you and Harry would constantly visit when you\u2019s were together, and here she is offering you a shoulder to cry on as you sip on the amazing hot chocolate she made.</p><p>\u201cI think talking to him will help,\u201d she says and pats your hand gently.\u00a0\u201cWhether or not you\u2019s get back together, that\u2019s up to you\u2019s\u2026 But I think talking him will at least give you some closure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d you tell her.\u00a0\u201cI just- I ignored him this entire time, I would be suprised if he still wants anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she starts and narrows her gaze.\u00a0\u201cThat man has gone out of his way to message you every week for the past two months while he\u2019s on tour, I don\u2019t think him not wanting anything to do with you is a valid thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d you agree, and look down at your hands.\u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and sleep on it, and decide what I\u2019m going to do in the morning. Thank you for the hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime sweetheart,\u201d she insists with a smile.\u00a0\u201cYou know you and Harry are welcome here at anytime. Now you better be back soon though, no more of this staying away for over two months bull, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d you smile, and glance at the clock behind her reading 12:45am.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll let you get some sleep too, thanks again Cheryl. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and walks you to the door, giving you a hug just before you step out into the rain again. The door dings shut behind you, and you don\u2019t have it in you to even look at Harry\u2019s building again. You start down the street, but stop when a voice calls out; causing your breathe to hitch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d The voice asks, and you don\u2019t need to turn around to know that it\u2019s your ex-boyfriend. You turn around slowly just as the man in question shuts the door of a black car he\u2019s just climbed out of, and it drives away. He walks right up to you, and you feel as if his eyes are burning holes into your unexposed skin.</p><p>\u201cH-hey H,\u201d you stutter, as he pushes his long wet hair away from his face.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d He asks in a slightly harsh tone.\u00a0\u201cIs that really all you have to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what else <i>to</i> say,\u201d you continue stammering, as the tears start pouring again.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m embarressed, I\u2019m sad, and relieved to see you. I just-, no actually n-never-mind. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that, Y/N?\u201d He questions and steps forward again.\u00a0\u201cYou always <i>leave</i>. If you\u2019re face to face with something, why do you feel so inclined to just walk away rather than facing it head on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, ok?\u201d You sob, and can see the tears in his eyes too.\u00a0\u201cIt just feels safer, and easier. I\u2019m less likely to get hurt if I leave, and not bother others with what\u2019s bothering me. It\u2019s my battles. I don\u2019t need to put them on anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can put them on me,\u201d he starts, and catches you off gaurd.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve always been able to come to me with your problems Y/N, and I\u2019m so sorry that I made it seem like you couldn\u2019t before all this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Harry, that wasn\u2019t you. It was m-,\u201d you try to reason, but he cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cIt <i>was</i> me,\u201d he states firmly.\u00a0\u201cI pushed you away by not letting you open up when you needed too. I was so selfish, and I hate myself for putting you through that. I\u2019ve been wanting to tell you that, but you haven\u2019t exactly made it easy or given me the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been ignoring you,\u201d you explain, and his green eyes begin to soften.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid. I just am so happy and proud to see you out there living your dream, I\u2019d hate myself if I ever got in the way of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never get in the way of that, Y/N. You\u2019re the one I want to share all of that with.\u201d He confesses, and you feel your heart beat quicken.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually ever told you that, but all those times where I\u2019ve said that you\u2019re it\u2026 I wasn\u2019t lying. There is no one else I want to do this life with, you\u2019re my everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH,\u201d you start, but he crushes his lips to yours to prevent you from any further arguments you don\u2019t mean. You respond immediately by moving your hands up, and tangling them into his long locks. The kiss is passionate, and longing on both ends. His tounge begs for access to your mouth, and you grant it; all while his arms snake around your waist to pull you closer too him, giving your butt a little squeeze. You slowly start pulling away, and meet his eyes before placing another peck onto his lips; and he leans his forehead agaisnt your\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I even have to tell you how badly I\u2019ve missed you?\u201d He asks sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t complain if you did,\u201d you say between chuckles, and push away your hair from your face.</p><p>\u201cHow about I show you instead?\u201d He suggests, and pulls your body against his.</p><p>\u201cEasy there tiger, that can wait a minute,\u201d you reply and pull him down for another passionate kiss. The two of you pull away again a moment later, and you look up to his eyes.\u00a0\u201cSo this mean we\u2019re back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere we ever not?\u201d He asks, and you furrow your eyebrows at him. He starts laughing before clearing his throat, and doing his best impression of Ross from Friends.\u00a0\u201cWE WERE ON A BREAK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much,\u201d you say between laughs as he pulls you in, and spins you around in the pouring rain.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a lie,\u201d he tells you, and links both of your hands together; slowly leading you back to his apartment building.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019glad to have you back, bub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d you agree, and lean your head against his shoulder as you\u2019s walk.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor far too long,\u201d he finishes the Nickelback lyric, and winks at you.\u00a0\u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to happen again, deal?\u201d You nod in agreement as you\u2019s approach the steps, and quickly glance back to where you\u2019s were standing; your mouth widening into a smile. Across the road is Cheryl in the coffee shop window waving, and smiling at the two of you\u2019s as she shuts off her sign; and you\u2019s disappear into the apartment to start your first long overdue night back together.</p></p>",

In the past two and a half months you\u2019ve done a lot, and you are extremely proud of yourself for it.\u00a0</p><p>Of all the positive things you\u2019ve been doing for yourself lately, there however has\u00a0been one constant negative you\u2019ve been doing that\u2019s slowly eating away at you; and that\u2019s been avoiding Harry.\u00a0</p><p>Every week for the past eleven weeks without fail, Harry has texted you; but not in an overbearing way. After the first seven days of being broken up his calls and texts slowly became less frequent, and it was completely understandable as to why seeing as the man was on a world tour. After that he\u2019d call once a week, but was quick picking up on how you more than likely weren\u2019t going to answer just like all the other times. Which has resulted in the weekly text messages.\u00a0</p><p>In every message, he gives you an update on his life, what he\u2019s spent the last week doing, and concludes the message with asking how you are;\u00a0which you are extremely grateful for. You\u2019ve gotten some peace of mind from these messages, as you know that at least he\u2019s doing ok; and that\u2019s all that matters to you.</p><p>However, you haven\u2019t responded to a single one of those texts or calls. Not to spite him in the slightest bit, but rather because he\u2019s been out there living his best life, and you feel talking about yourself will take away from that.</p><p>Despite the feeling of you bringing Harry down, and not having the guts to answer him; you\u2019ve kept in contact with Anne and Gemma, seeing as you\u2019d grown quite close to both women over the duration of your relationship with Harry. You and Gemma have continued your tradition of weekly coffee dates that began shortly after the two of you met; which is what you\u2019re doing currenlty.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOrder for Y/N,\u201d the Starbucks barista calls out, and slides two cups towards you on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you tell her with a smile as you take the drinks. You turn around and walk over to Gemma sitting in a table over in the corner of the store.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI feel that you\u2019re lying about me buying our coffee\u2019s last week,\u201d she states when you hand her one of the drinks, and sit down across from her.\u00a0\u201cYup you definitely are, stop scamming my turns of buying for us from me, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d catch on,\u201d you mutter; earning yourself an eyeroll from your ex\u2019s sister, but also one of your closest friends.</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d she responds and smirks as she sips her latte.\u00a0\u201cSo what\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much actually,\u201d you tell her honestly.\u00a0\u201cJust the usual. If I\u2019m not at school, I\u2019m at work, and vise versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re living the dream,\u201d she chuckles, as do you.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s dream maybe, not necessarily mine,\u201d you answer and send her a wink.\u00a0\u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing\u2026 well minus the school part, but just work,\u201d she explains, and you nod in understanding. Without another word; you glance outside at the rainy September weather as it pours into the streets of London, and sigh.\u00a0\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh nothing,\u201d you ramble, and look back to her.\u00a0\u201cSorry, my mind has all over the place the past couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask what it is causing that?\u201d She questions, causing you to look at her with a slightly confused expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing important,\u201d you say dissmisively, and she scoffs.</p><p>\u201cSo it has nothing to do with my brother being back in London, is what you\u2019re saying, right?\u201d She challenges with a smirk, and your mouth falls open.</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d you stutter as you try to cover up your reaction.\u00a0\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of it,\u201d she states, and you let out another sigh. Silence falls over the two of you, and your eyes slowly drift to look out the window again.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s ok to miss him, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you whisper without looking at her.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t even express how much I miss him, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m really happy for him, Gem. He\u2019s doing just fine without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you so sure, hmm? Did he tell you that?\u201d She questions, and you shake your head no.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t given him the chance too,\u201d you mutter in response.\u00a0\u201cI just know he\u2019s ok, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re greatly incorrect about him being ok without you Y/N,\u201d she tells you, but you shrug it off.</p><p>You slowly move your gaze back to meet her\u2019s, and start feeling guilty all over again. Maybe Harry does miss you, but you feel not being together is what he needs. Originally it was what you thought you needed, but the past two and a half months have proven that you were so wrong about that. You need Harry in your life, but aren\u2019t\u00a0selfish enough to put your needs before what you think are his.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore, we\u2019re not together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Y/N,\u201d she says and shakes her head dissaprovingly.\u00a0\u201cMy brother really is the only one who\u2019s able to get through to you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d You just shrug again, and shake your head as your gaze moves to the ground before she speaks p again.\u00a0\u201cHe has a show tomorrow night, at the O2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d you tell her.\u00a0\u201cThe boys have like six shows there, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d she confirms, and takes another sip of her drink.\u00a0\u201cMum and I are going tomorrow night\u2019s show, and the night after. That one is the last one of the six and Harry left a few tickets aside\u2026 Come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Gemma I can\u2019t,\u201d you explain as you shake your head in protest.\u00a0\u201cI-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me some excuse, Y/N, I know you\u2019re free,\u201d she cuts you off and looks at you pointedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d you reply and put your hand on your chest, as if she\u2019s greatly offended you.\u00a0\u201cWhat makes you think I was going to come up with an excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you,\u201d she replys and leans down to pick her bag up off the ground.\u00a0\u201cListen, I can\u2019t make you go. But I know mum and I would both love having you there with us. I have to get to work though, but at least think about it, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d you tell her quietly, and nod.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later Gem. Have a good day at work.\u201d The two of you say your goodbyes, and you\u2019re left with your thoughts. You spend the next twenty minutes finishing your latte and watching the rain, before finally heading home for the night.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026 As soon as you got back to the loft last night and told your best friend about your talk with Gemma, she wouldn\u2019t shut up about how you should go to the concert; and finally getting over your stubborness, you sent Gemma a text saying you would join her and Anne to go to the show.\u00a0</p><p>So here you are, standing in front of your full length mirror; prepared to take off your fourth outfit, and try on another one. You leave your favourite ripped jeans on, and try on yet another top; but groan in frustration when it doesn\u2019t look as good as you thought it would.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with all the noises?\u201d Your best friends asks as she peaks her head in the doorway of your room.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find anything to wear,\u201d you grumble, and angrily pick up another top to try on.</p><p>\u201cOk drama queen,\u201d she says and steps more into the doorway a bit more, crossing her arms as she does so.\u00a0\u201cY/N, you literally look good in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incorrect,\u201d you tell her as you look at a long-sleeved, lace, burgundy top.\u00a0\u201cAnd I can\u2019t just look <i>good</i>, I need to look better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, how could I forget?\u201d She asks, and you snap your eyes to hers.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get your man back.\u201d Your gaze hardens, but she doesn\u2019t seem threatened as she starts laughing, and begins walking away.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m kidding, chill. But wear that top you\u2019re holding, it makes your boobs look good. And hurry, I think Anne and Gemma are here to pick you up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d you blurt out, and quickly throw the shirt on. You glance at yourself in the mirror, and are taken aback. Y/F/N was right; your boobs look great in this top, and you\u2019re totally feeling yourself in it. You quickly fix your hair to the way you originally styled it, and grab your favourite leather jacket before bolting out the door.</p><p>The concert is just about ready to start when you, Anne, and Gemma arrive to the arena. The three of you are quickly let into the private parking, and escorted to your seats along the catwalk.\u00a0</p><p>The fans around you start buzzing with excitement as everyone prepares for the boys to take the stage, and a couple of them are very observant; quickly picking up on that you are in the crowd with Harry\u2019s mum and sister, and subtly try take some pictures. Some look like they\u2019re debating on approaching the three of you, but don\u2019t as the lights turn off, and everyone goes nuts.\u00a0</p><p>Screams erupt from all over as the lights on the stage start flashing, and you find yourself cheering along with everyone else. A moment later, the boys are on the stage as they wave to the crowd, and start singing the first song.\u00a0</p><p>The four of them make their way around the stage as the song continues, and your eyes instantly fall on the long haired boy as he hits his notes perfectly. You\u2019re heart flutters, and it all hits you like a brick wall; just how much you\u2019ve missed him. He looks good, so effortlessly good, and it\u2019s hard to take your eyes off of him.\u00a0</p><p>Your gaze moves to Niall as he\u2019s going to pass you, Anne, and Gemma on the catwalk. He\u2019s laughing, and goes to high-five some fans; but then his line of sight meets yours, and his eyes widen. His smiles widens as well, while Liam walks towards him; singing into the mic. Niall swats his arm and points to you, causing Liam\u2019s eyes to widen as well. He smiles and waves, before looking forward again, and finishing his part of the song. Louis walks by next, and is quick noticing you due to Niall and Liams actions. He smiles, and nods at you; as well as greets fans, before continuing after the other two.</p><p>Lastly, Harry approaches. He sings another part of the song and moves it from his mouth, just as his eyes land on his mum and sister. He smiles at them, and his eyes move slightly; immediately connecting with yours, and widening. The look of total shock that takes over his features is extremely obvious, as he comes to a complete stop a few feet away from you. He looks away and back again, as if trying to make sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things; and soon realizes his eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on him. You can\u2019t help but laugh a little bit as he shakes his head, and starts singing again. You send him a small wave as he walks by, and he doesn\u2019t take his eyes off of you until he\u2019s well past where you\u2019re seated.\u00a0</p><p>The majority of the concert plays out like it started. The four boys put on a phenomenal show, and the crowds reactions are proof of that. Whenever he could, Harry was locking his eyes with yours; like he was worried you were going to disappear, and your heart swelled each time.</p><p>Once the concert is over, and the boys have done their encore before leaving the stage; everyone starts departing. You just kind of stand there for a moment, unsure of what to do next. But then someone taps on your arm, and speaks up.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d Anne asks gently, and you look to her.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to go backstage to see Harry, would you like to come?\u201d</p><p>You look between her, and Gemma considering it; but decide not too.\u00a0\u201cUhm, no I think I\u2019m going to just head out actually,\u201d you tell her softly, and she frowns.\u00a0\u201cYou two go, he probably misses the two of you and is waiting to see you\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes for you, Y/N,\u201d Gemma adds.\u00a0\u201cWe all saw him watch you through that entire show, you should go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t think I will,\u201d you tell her, and she sighs in defeat. Without any more arguing, the two women hug you goodbye, and you make your way out of the arena.\u00a0</p><p>You walk a couple of blocks until it starts raining again\u2026 Surprise. The leather jacket you brought isn\u2019t much protection against the weather, so you eventually give up and wave down a cab. You\u2019re a fan of walking; it helps clear your mind, but you didn\u2019t get to do much thinking before the rain started, so unsuprisingly you\u2019re not thinking very straight when you give the driver Harry\u2019s address to drive you to rather than your own.\u00a0</p><p>It doesn\u2019t even register in your mind what you\u2019ve done until the driver takes a turn, and the all to familliar street Harry\u2019s apartment is on comes into view. Panic washes over you as the cab comes to a stop outside his building, and you\u2019re completely speechless. You mutter a thank you, and hand him the money for the ride; before climbing out of the vehicle, and wrapping your arms around your middle.</p><p>You stare up at the building, and tears begin filling your eyes. This place was home, but now it feels empty. All the memories of your times here with Harry seep into your mind, and it causes your tears to start pouring; although they\u2019d be invisible to someone passing by as they blend in extremely well with the pouring rain that also streams down your face.</p><p>With one final glance at the window you know to be Harry\u2019s bedroom, you shake your head and start walking down the street again; in search of another cab so you can go back to your loft.</p><p>The street is quiet, seeing as it is late; but a familiar flashing of an\u00a0\u2018<i>Open\u2019</i>\u00a0sign on a shop across the road catches your eye, and you find yourself migrating towards it. You reach the door and push it open, hearing the familiar ding that greets you everytime you enter your favourite shop.</p><p>The coffee shop is completely empty, and you stay standing at the door for a moment until the person you were wanting to see comes rushing out from the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear we\u2019re actually closing,\u201d Cheryl, the coffee shops owner calls as she wipes her hand on a rag. It takes her a moment to realize who it is standing there looking like a drenched rat, but when she does, her face lights right up.\u00a0\u201cY/N?\u201d She asks and steps out from behind the counter.\u00a0\u201cOh my- are you ok, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a rough night,\u201d you blubber as a sob cracks your voice, and she rushes over to you.</p><p>\u201cWell come sit down then, I\u2019ll get you a hot chocolate,\u201d she states in a concered tone, and motions for you to follow her to the counter so she can make it.</p><p>You spend the next hour catching her up on what has happened over the past couple of months, as well as the events of tonight. She listens intently, and offers great advice on the entire matter; giving you a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from <a href=\"https://emotionally-imbruised.tumblr.com/post/177998865849/picture-this-january-1st\">January 1st</a> a couple of years ago, the day you first met this lovely woman.</p><p>She helped you out that day, was someone you and Harry would constantly visit when you\u2019s were together, and here she is offering you a shoulder to cry on as you sip on the amazing hot chocolate she made.</p><p>\u201cI think talking to him will help,\u201d she says and pats your hand gently.\u00a0\u201cWhether or not you\u2019s get back together, that\u2019s up to you\u2019s\u2026 But I think talking him will at least give you some closure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d you tell her.\u00a0\u201cI just- I ignored him this entire time, I would be suprised if he still wants anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d she starts and narrows her gaze.\u00a0\u201cThat man has gone out of his way to message you every week for the past two months while he\u2019s on tour, I don\u2019t think him not wanting anything to do with you is a valid thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d you agree, and look down at your hands.\u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and sleep on it, and decide what I\u2019m going to do in the morning. Thank you for the hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime sweetheart,\u201d she insists with a smile.\u00a0\u201cYou know you and Harry are welcome here at anytime. Now you better be back soon though, no more of this staying away for over two months bull, ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d you smile, and glance at the clock behind her reading 12:45am.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll let you get some sleep too, thanks again Cheryl. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and walks you to the door, giving you a hug just before you step out into the rain again. The door dings shut behind you, and you don\u2019t have it in you to even look at Harry\u2019s building again. You start down the street, but stop when a voice calls out; causing your breathe to hitch.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d The voice asks, and you don\u2019t need to turn around to know that it\u2019s your ex-boyfriend. You turn around slowly just as the man in question shuts the door of a black car he\u2019s just climbed out of, and it drives away. He walks right up to you, and you feel as if his eyes are burning holes into your unexposed skin.</p><p>\u201cH-hey H,\u201d you stutter, as he pushes his long wet hair away from his face.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d He asks in a slightly harsh tone.\u00a0\u201cIs that really all you have to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what else <i>to</i> say,\u201d you continue stammering, as the tears start pouring again.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m embarressed, I\u2019m sad, and relieved to see you. I just-, no actually n-never-mind. I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that, Y/N?\u201d He questions and steps forward again.\u00a0\u201cYou always <i>leave</i>. If you\u2019re face to face with something, why do you feel so inclined to just walk away rather than facing it head on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, ok?\u201d You sob, and can see the tears in his eyes too.\u00a0\u201cIt just feels safer, and easier. I\u2019m less likely to get hurt if I leave, and not bother others with what\u2019s bothering me. It\u2019s my battles. I don\u2019t need to put them on anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can put them on me,\u201d he starts, and catches you off gaurd.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve always been able to come to me with your problems Y/N, and I\u2019m so sorry that I made it seem like you couldn\u2019t before all this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Harry, that wasn\u2019t you. It was m-,\u201d you try to reason, but he cuts you off.</p><p>\u201cIt <i>was</i> me,\u201d he states firmly.\u00a0\u201cI pushed you away by not letting you open up when you needed too. I was so selfish, and I hate myself for putting you through that. I\u2019ve been wanting to tell you that, but you haven\u2019t exactly made it easy or given me the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been ignoring you,\u201d you explain, and his green eyes begin to soften.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid. I just am so happy and proud to see you out there living your dream, I\u2019d hate myself if I ever got in the way of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never get in the way of that, Y/N. You\u2019re the one I want to share all of that with.\u201d He confesses, and you feel your heart beat quicken.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually ever told you that, but all those times where I\u2019ve said that you\u2019re it\u2026 I wasn\u2019t lying. There is no one else I want to do this life with, you\u2019re my everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH,\u201d you start, but he crushes his lips to yours to prevent you from any further arguments you don\u2019t mean. You respond immediately by moving your hands up, and tangling them into his long locks. The kiss is passionate, and longing on both ends. His tounge begs for access to your mouth, and you grant it; all while his arms snake around your waist to pull you closer too him, giving your butt a little squeeze. You slowly start pulling away, and meet his eyes before placing another peck onto his lips; and he leans his forehead agaisnt your\u2019s.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I even have to tell you how badly I\u2019ve missed you?\u201d He asks sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t complain if you did,\u201d you say between chuckles, and push away your hair from your face.</p><p>\u201cHow about I show you instead?\u201d He suggests, and pulls your body against his.</p><p>\u201cEasy there tiger, that can wait a minute,\u201d you reply and pull him down for another passionate kiss. The two of you pull away again a moment later, and you look up to his eyes.\u00a0\u201cSo this mean we\u2019re back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere we ever not?\u201d He asks, and you furrow your eyebrows at him. He starts laughing before clearing his throat, and doing his best impression of Ross from Friends.\u00a0\u201cWE WERE ON A BREAK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much,\u201d you say between laughs as he pulls you in, and spins you around in the pouring rain.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a lie,\u201d he tells you, and links both of your hands together; slowly leading you back to his apartment building.\u00a0\u201cM\u2019glad to have you back, bub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d you agree, and lean your head against his shoulder as you\u2019s walk.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor far too long,\u201d he finishes the Nickelback lyric, and winks at you.\u00a0\u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to happen again, deal?\u201d You nod in agreement as you\u2019s approach the steps, and quickly glance back to where you\u2019s were standing; your mouth widening into a smile. Across the road is Cheryl in the coffee shop window waving, and smiling at the two of you\u2019s as she shuts off her sign; and you\u2019s disappear into the apartment to start your first long overdue night back together.</p></p>",

After that he&rsquo;d call once a week, but was quick picking up on how you more than likely weren&rsquo;t going to answer just like all the other times. Which has resulted in the weekly text messages.&nbsp;</p><p>In every message, he gives you an update on his life, what he&rsquo;s spent the last week doing, and concludes the message with asking how you are;&nbsp;which you are extremely grateful for. You&rsquo;ve gotten some peace of mind from these messages, as you know that at least he&rsquo;s doing ok; and that&rsquo;s all that matters to you.</p><p>However, you haven&rsquo;t responded to a single one of those texts or calls. Not to spite him in the slightest bit, but rather because he&rsquo;s been out there living his best life, and you feel talking about yourself will take away from that.</p><p>Despite the feeling of you bringing Harry down, and not having the guts to answer him; you&rsquo;ve kept in contact with Anne and Gemma, seeing as you&rsquo;d grown quite close to both women over the duration of your relationship with Harry. You and Gemma have continued your tradition of weekly coffee dates that began shortly after the two of you met; which is what you&rsquo;re doing currenlty.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Order for Y/N,&rdquo; the Starbucks barista calls out, and slides two cups towards you on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you tell her with a smile as you take the drinks. You turn around and walk over to Gemma sitting in a table over in the corner of the store.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel that you&rsquo;re lying about me buying our coffee&rsquo;s last week,&rdquo; she states when you hand her one of the drinks, and sit down across from her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yup you definitely are, stop scamming my turns of buying for us from me, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d catch on,&rdquo; you mutter; earning yourself an eyeroll from your ex&rsquo;s sister, but also one of your closest friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm,&rdquo; she responds and smirks as she sips her latte.&nbsp;&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much actually,&rdquo; you tell her honestly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just the usual. If I&rsquo;m not at school, I&rsquo;m at work, and vise versa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like you&rsquo;re living the dream,&rdquo; she chuckles, as do you.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s dream maybe, not necessarily mine,&rdquo; you answer and send her a wink.&nbsp;&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same thing&hellip; well minus the school part, but just work,&rdquo; she explains, and you nod in understanding. Without another word; you glance outside at the rainy September weather as it pours into the streets of London, and sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Penny for your thoughts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, uh nothing,&rdquo; you ramble, and look back to her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, my mind has all over the place the past couple of days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May I ask what it is causing that?&rdquo; She questions, causing you to look at her with a slightly confused expression.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing important,&rdquo; you say dissmisively, and she scoffs.</p><p>&ldquo;So it has nothing to do with my brother being back in London, is what you&rsquo;re saying, right?&rdquo; She challenges with a smirk, and your mouth falls open.</p><p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; you stutter as you try to cover up your reaction.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so full of it,&rdquo; she states, and you let out another sigh. Silence falls over the two of you, and your eyes slowly drift to look out the window again.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok to miss him, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you whisper without looking at her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even express how much I miss him, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;m really happy for him, Gem. He&rsquo;s doing just fine without me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what makes you so sure, hmm? Did he tell you that?&rdquo; She questions, and you shake your head no.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t given him the chance too,&rdquo; you mutter in response.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just know he&rsquo;s ok, and that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re greatly incorrect about him being ok without you Y/N,&rdquo; she tells you, but you shrug it off.</p><p>You slowly move your gaze back to meet her&rsquo;s, and start feeling guilty all over again. Maybe Harry does miss you, but you feel not being together is what he needs. Originally it was what you thought you needed, but the past two and a half months have proven that you were so wrong about that. You need Harry in your life, but aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;selfish enough to put your needs before what you think are his.&nbsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore, we&rsquo;re not together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Y/N,&rdquo; she says and shakes her head dissaprovingly.&nbsp;&ldquo;My brother really is the only one who&rsquo;s able to get through to you, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; You just shrug again, and shake your head as your gaze moves to the ground before she speaks p again.&nbsp;&ldquo;He has a show tomorrow night, at the O2.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; you tell her.&nbsp;&ldquo;The boys have like six shows there, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; she confirms, and takes another sip of her drink.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mum and I are going tomorrow night&rsquo;s show, and the night after. That one is the last one of the six and Harry left a few tickets aside&hellip; Come with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, Gemma I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you explain as you shake your head in protest.&nbsp;&ldquo;I-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me some excuse, Y/N, I know you&rsquo;re free,&rdquo; she cuts you off and looks at you pointedly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; you reply and put your hand on your chest, as if she&rsquo;s greatly offended you.&nbsp;&ldquo;What makes you think I was going to come up with an excuse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I know you,&rdquo; she replys and leans down to pick her bag up off the ground.&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen, I can&rsquo;t make you go. But I know mum and I would both love having you there with us. I have to get to work though, but at least think about it, ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; you tell her quietly, and nod.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you later Gem. Have a good day at work.&rdquo; The two of you say your goodbyes, and you&rsquo;re left with your thoughts. You spend the next twenty minutes finishing your latte and watching the rain, before finally heading home for the night.&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip; As soon as you got back to the loft last night and told your best friend about your talk with Gemma, she wouldn&rsquo;t shut up about how you should go to the concert; and finally getting over your stubborness, you sent Gemma a text saying you would join her and Anne to go to the show.&nbsp;</p><p>So here you are, standing in front of your full length mirror; prepared to take off your fourth outfit, and try on another one. You leave your favourite ripped jeans on, and try on yet another top; but groan in frustration when it doesn&rsquo;t look as good as you thought it would.</p><p>&ldquo;What is with all the noises?&rdquo; Your best friends asks as she peaks her head in the doorway of your room.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find anything to wear,&rdquo; you grumble, and angrily pick up another top to try on.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok drama queen,&rdquo; she says and steps more into the doorway a bit more, crossing her arms as she does so.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N, you literally look good in everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s incorrect,&rdquo; you tell her as you look at a long-sleeved, lace, burgundy top.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t just look <i>good</i>, I need to look better than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes, how could I forget?&rdquo; She asks, and you snap your eyes to hers.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna get your man back.&rdquo; Your gaze hardens, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem threatened as she starts laughing, and begins walking away.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding, chill. But wear that top you&rsquo;re holding, it makes your boobs look good. And hurry, I think Anne and Gemma are here to pick you up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Crap,&rdquo; you blurt out, and quickly throw the shirt on. You glance at yourself in the mirror, and are taken aback. Y/F/N was right; your boobs look great in this top, and you&rsquo;re totally feeling yourself in it. You quickly fix your hair to the way you originally styled it, and grab your favourite leather jacket before bolting out the door.</p><p>The concert is just about ready to start when you, Anne, and Gemma arrive to the arena. The three of you are quickly let into the private parking, and escorted to your seats along the catwalk.&nbsp;</p><p>The fans around you start buzzing with excitement as everyone prepares for the boys to take the stage, and a couple of them are very observant; quickly picking up on that you are in the crowd with Harry&rsquo;s mum and sister, and subtly try take some pictures. Some look like they&rsquo;re debating on approaching the three of you, but don&rsquo;t as the lights turn off, and everyone goes nuts.&nbsp;</p><p>Screams erupt from all over as the lights on the stage start flashing, and you find yourself cheering along with everyone else. A moment later, the boys are on the stage as they wave to the crowd, and start singing the first song.&nbsp;</p><p>The four of them make their way around the stage as the song continues, and your eyes instantly fall on the long haired boy as he hits his notes perfectly. You&rsquo;re heart flutters, and it all hits you like a brick wall; just how much you&rsquo;ve missed him. He looks good, so effortlessly good, and it&rsquo;s hard to take your eyes off of him.&nbsp;</p><p>Your gaze moves to Niall as he&rsquo;s going to pass you, Anne, and Gemma on the catwalk. He&rsquo;s laughing, and goes to high-five some fans; but then his line of sight meets yours, and his eyes widen. His smiles widens as well, while Liam walks towards him; singing into the mic. Niall swats his arm and points to you, causing Liam&rsquo;s eyes to widen as well. He smiles and waves, before looking forward again, and finishing his part of the song. Louis walks by next, and is quick noticing you due to Niall and Liams actions. He smiles, and nods at you; as well as greets fans, before continuing after the other two.</p><p>Lastly, Harry approaches. He sings another part of the song and moves it from his mouth, just as his eyes land on his mum and sister. He smiles at them, and his eyes move slightly; immediately connecting with yours, and widening. The look of total shock that takes over his features is extremely obvious, as he comes to a complete stop a few feet away from you. He looks away and back again, as if trying to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t seeing things; and soon realizes his eyes aren&rsquo;t playing tricks on him. You can&rsquo;t help but laugh a little bit as he shakes his head, and starts singing again. You send him a small wave as he walks by, and he doesn&rsquo;t take his eyes off of you until he&rsquo;s well past where you&rsquo;re seated.&nbsp;</p><p>The majority of the concert plays out like it started. The four boys put on a phenomenal show, and the crowds reactions are proof of that. Whenever he could, Harry was locking his eyes with yours; like he was worried you were going to disappear, and your heart swelled each time.</p><p>Once the concert is over, and the boys have done their encore before leaving the stage; everyone starts departing. You just kind of stand there for a moment, unsure of what to do next. But then someone taps on your arm, and speaks up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Anne asks gently, and you look to her.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to go backstage to see Harry, would you like to come?&rdquo;</p><p>You look between her, and Gemma considering it; but decide not too.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uhm, no I think I&rsquo;m going to just head out actually,&rdquo; you tell her softly, and she frowns.&nbsp;&ldquo;You two go, he probably misses the two of you and is waiting to see you&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same goes for you, Y/N,&rdquo; Gemma adds.&nbsp;&ldquo;We all saw him watch you through that entire show, you should go talk to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t think I will,&rdquo; you tell her, and she sighs in defeat. Without any more arguing, the two women hug you goodbye, and you make your way out of the arena.&nbsp;</p><p>You walk a couple of blocks until it starts raining again&hellip; Surprise. The leather jacket you brought isn&rsquo;t much protection against the weather, so you eventually give up and wave down a cab. You&rsquo;re a fan of walking; it helps clear your mind, but you didn&rsquo;t get to do much thinking before the rain started, so unsuprisingly you&rsquo;re not thinking very straight when you give the driver Harry&rsquo;s address to drive you to rather than your own.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t even register in your mind what you&rsquo;ve done until the driver takes a turn, and the all to familliar street Harry&rsquo;s apartment is on comes into view. Panic washes over you as the cab comes to a stop outside his building, and you&rsquo;re completely speechless. You mutter a thank you, and hand him the money for the ride; before climbing out of the vehicle, and wrapping your arms around your middle.</p><p>You stare up at the building, and tears begin filling your eyes. This place was home, but now it feels empty. All the memories of your times here with Harry seep into your mind, and it causes your tears to start pouring; although they&rsquo;d be invisible to someone passing by as they blend in extremely well with the pouring rain that also streams down your face.</p><p>With one final glance at the window you know to be Harry&rsquo;s bedroom, you shake your head and start walking down the street again; in search of another cab so you can go back to your loft.</p><p>The street is quiet, seeing as it is late; but a familiar flashing of an&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>Open&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;sign on a shop across the road catches your eye, and you find yourself migrating towards it. You reach the door and push it open, hearing the familiar ding that greets you everytime you enter your favourite shop.</p><p>The coffee shop is completely empty, and you stay standing at the door for a moment until the person you were wanting to see comes rushing out from the back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry dear we&rsquo;re actually closing,&rdquo; Cheryl, the coffee shops owner calls as she wipes her hand on a rag. It takes her a moment to realize who it is standing there looking like a drenched rat, but when she does, her face lights right up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; She asks and steps out from behind the counter.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my- are you ok, love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a rough night,&rdquo; you blubber as a sob cracks your voice, and she rushes over to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Well come sit down then, I&rsquo;ll get you a hot chocolate,&rdquo; she states in a concered tone, and motions for you to follow her to the counter so she can make it.</p><p>You spend the next hour catching her up on what has happened over the past couple of months, as well as the events of tonight. She listens intently, and offers great advice on the entire matter; giving you a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu from <a href=\"https://emotionally-imbruised.tumblr.com/post/177998865849/picture-this-january-1st\">January 1st</a> a couple of years ago, the day you first met this lovely woman.</p><p>She helped you out that day, was someone you and Harry would constantly visit when you&rsquo;s were together, and here she is offering you a shoulder to cry on as you sip on the amazing hot chocolate she made.</p><p>&ldquo;I think talking to him will help,&rdquo; she says and pats your hand gently.&nbsp;&ldquo;Whether or not you&rsquo;s get back together, that&rsquo;s up to you&rsquo;s&hellip; But I think talking him will at least give you some closure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; you tell her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just- I ignored him this entire time, I would be suprised if he still wants anything to do with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; she starts and narrows her gaze.&nbsp;&ldquo;That man has gone out of his way to message you every week for the past two months while he&rsquo;s on tour, I don&rsquo;t think him not wanting anything to do with you is a valid thought.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; you agree, and look down at your hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to go home and sleep on it, and decide what I&rsquo;m going to do in the morning. Thank you for the hot chocolate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anytime sweetheart,&rdquo; she insists with a smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know you and Harry are welcome here at anytime. Now you better be back soon though, no more of this staying away for over two months bull, ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; you smile, and glance at the clock behind her reading 12:45am.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you get some sleep too, thanks again Cheryl. Have a good night.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiles and walks you to the door, giving you a hug just before you step out into the rain again. The door dings shut behind you, and you don&rsquo;t have it in you to even look at Harry&rsquo;s building again. You start down the street, but stop when a voice calls out; causing your breathe to hitch.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; The voice asks, and you don&rsquo;t need to turn around to know that it&rsquo;s your ex-boyfriend. You turn around slowly just as the man in question shuts the door of a black car he&rsquo;s just climbed out of, and it drives away. He walks right up to you, and you feel as if his eyes are burning holes into your unexposed skin.</p><p>&ldquo;H-hey H,&rdquo; you stutter, as he pushes his long wet hair away from his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; He asks in a slightly harsh tone.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is that really all you have to say to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know what else <i>to</i> say,&rdquo; you continue stammering, as the tears start pouring again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m embarressed, I&rsquo;m sad, and relieved to see you. I just-, no actually n-never-mind. I should go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you do that, Y/N?&rdquo; He questions and steps forward again.&nbsp;&ldquo;You always <i>leave</i>. If you&rsquo;re face to face with something, why do you feel so inclined to just walk away rather than facing it head on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, ok?&rdquo; You sob, and can see the tears in his eyes too.&nbsp;&ldquo;It just feels safer, and easier. I&rsquo;m less likely to get hurt if I leave, and not bother others with what&rsquo;s bothering me. It&rsquo;s my battles. I don&rsquo;t need to put them on anyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can put them on me,&rdquo; he starts, and catches you off gaurd.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been able to come to me with your problems Y/N, and I&rsquo;m so sorry that I made it seem like you couldn&rsquo;t before all this happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No Harry, that wasn&rsquo;t you. It was m-,&rdquo; you try to reason, but he cuts you off.</p><p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> me,&rdquo; he states firmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I pushed you away by not letting you open up when you needed too. I was so selfish, and I hate myself for putting you through that. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you that, but you haven&rsquo;t exactly made it easy or given me the chance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve been ignoring you,&rdquo; you explain, and his green eyes begin to soften.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been afraid. I just am so happy and proud to see you out there living your dream, I&rsquo;d hate myself if I ever got in the way of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could never get in the way of that, Y/N. You&rsquo;re the one I want to share all of that with.&rdquo; He confesses, and you feel your heart beat quicken.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve actually ever told you that, but all those times where I&rsquo;ve said that you&rsquo;re it&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t lying. There is no one else I want to do this life with, you&rsquo;re my everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;H,&rdquo; you start, but he crushes his lips to yours to prevent you from any further arguments you don&rsquo;t mean. You respond immediately by moving your hands up, and tangling them into his long locks. The kiss is passionate, and longing on both ends. His tounge begs for access to your mouth, and you grant it; all while his arms snake around your waist to pull you closer too him, giving your butt a little squeeze. You slowly start pulling away, and meet his eyes before placing another peck onto his lips; and he leans his forehead agaisnt your&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I even have to tell you how badly I&rsquo;ve missed you?&rdquo; He asks sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t complain if you did,&rdquo; you say between chuckles, and push away your hair from your face.</p><p>&ldquo;How about I show you instead?&rdquo; He suggests, and pulls your body against his.</p><p>&ldquo;Easy there tiger, that can wait a minute,&rdquo; you reply and pull him down for another passionate kiss. The two of you pull away again a moment later, and you look up to his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;So this mean we&rsquo;re back together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were we ever not?&rdquo; He asks, and you furrow your eyebrows at him. He starts laughing before clearing his throat, and doing his best impression of Ross from Friends.&nbsp;&ldquo;WE WERE ON A BREAK.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you so much,&rdquo; you say between laughs as he pulls you in, and spins you around in the pouring rain.</p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he tells you, and links both of your hands together; slowly leading you back to his apartment building.&nbsp;&ldquo;M&rsquo;glad to have you back, bub.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; you agree, and lean your head against his shoulder as you&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been far away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For far too long,&rdquo; he finishes the Nickelback lyric, and winks at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not going to happen again, deal?&rdquo; You nod in agreement as you&rsquo;s approach the steps, and quickly glance back to where you&rsquo;s were standing; your mouth widening into a smile. Across the road is Cheryl in the coffee shop window waving, and smiling at the two of you&rsquo;s as she shuts off her sign; and you&rsquo;s disappear into the apartment to start your first long overdue night back together.</p></p>",
