Especially after they had just finished having mind blowing sex and we\u2019re having a little cuddle. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think I love you.\u201d (9) She blurted, cuddling into his side as she traced the butterfly on his torso. </p>\n\n<p>Shock. That\u2019s what he felt. In that moment he felt only shock. Perhaps it\u2019s because the declaration caught him off guard, or maybe he wasn\u2019t sure that he heard what she said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cW-what?!\u201d He gasped, untangling himself from her and sitting up on the bed. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI said, I think I love you.\u201d She repeated, not missing a beat. </p>\n\n<p>He just stared at her. Giving her absolutely no confirmation or denial that he felt the same; until he spoke again. Running a hand down his face, he let out a long, deep sigh. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re just fucking. If I would\u2019ve known you were getting too attached I would\u2019ve ended this already. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were catching feelings?\u201d He asked, sliding on a pair of clean briefs and searching his wardrobe for a new T Shirt. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?! Why would you end this? Do you seriously feel nothing for me?\u201d She questioned, pulling herself up off the bed and walking across the room to where he stood by his closet. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He replied, refusing to look at her as he crossed the room once again to retrieve his Vans from under his bed. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think you should leave, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry. Keep in touch though, yeah?\u201d He said exiting his bedroom and waiting patiently in the hallway for her to follow him out. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSeriously, Harry?!\u201d She all but shouted, \u201ckeep in touch? The fuck kinda bullshit line is that? You\u2019re acting like we\u2019re two best friends going away to separate universities. I just told you I\u2019m falling in love with you! And all I get is a \u201ckeep in touch, yeah?\u201d I don\u2019t think so. Look me in the eye and tell me this meant nothing to you (74). That I mean nothing to you.\u201d Y/N said, pushing at Harry\u2019s chest. </p>\n\n<p>H just stood there wide eyed and stunned. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Y/N. truly I am. You should go.\u201d H said, opening the front door of his house. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, you can\u2019t say anything because you\u2019re a fucking coward, Harry. You can\u2019t admit to your feelings! You won\u2019t say you love me, yet you won\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t. Just tell me this, Harry\u2026 had I not said anything today, how long did you plan on keeping me around? Until you got tired of me and found someone better? Another supermodel to warm your bed?

But he sure as hell knew it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t love her. He did. A lot. It just took him by surprise to hear her say those words. Especially after they had just finished having mind blowing sex and we\u2019re having a little cuddle. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think I love you.\u201d (9) She blurted, cuddling into his side as she traced the butterfly on his torso. </p>\n\n<p>Shock. That\u2019s what he felt. In that moment he felt only shock. Perhaps it\u2019s because the declaration caught him off guard, or maybe he wasn\u2019t sure that he heard what she said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cW-what?!\u201d He gasped, untangling himself from her and sitting up on the bed. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI said, I think I love you.\u201d She repeated, not missing a beat. </p>\n\n<p>He just stared at her. Giving her absolutely no confirmation or denial that he felt the same; until he spoke again. Running a hand down his face, he let out a long, deep sigh. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re just fucking. If I would\u2019ve known you were getting too attached I would\u2019ve ended this already. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were catching feelings?\u201d He asked, sliding on a pair of clean briefs and searching his wardrobe for a new T Shirt. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat?! Why would you end this? Do you seriously feel nothing for me?\u201d She questioned, pulling herself up off the bed and walking across the room to where he stood by his closet. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He replied, refusing to look at her as he crossed the room once again to retrieve his Vans from under his bed. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think you should leave, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry. Keep in touch though, yeah?\u201d He said exiting his bedroom and waiting patiently in the hallway for her to follow him out. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cSeriously, Harry?!\u201d She all but shouted, \u201ckeep in touch? The fuck kinda bullshit line is that? You\u2019re acting like we\u2019re two best friends going away to separate universities. I just told you I\u2019m falling in love with you! And all I get is a \u201ckeep in touch, yeah?\u201d I don\u2019t think so. Look me in the eye and tell me this meant nothing to you (74). That I mean nothing to you.\u201d Y/N said, pushing at Harry\u2019s chest. </p>\n\n<p>H just stood there wide eyed and stunned. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Y/N. truly I am. You should go.\u201d H said, opening the front door of his house. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, you can\u2019t say anything because you\u2019re a fucking coward, Harry. You can\u2019t admit to your feelings! You won\u2019t say you love me, yet you won\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t. Just tell me this, Harry\u2026 had I not said anything today, how long did you plan on keeping me around? Until you got tired of me and found someone better? Another supermodel to warm your bed? Or another pop star perhaps?\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Again, nothing. Complete silence and an emotionless stare. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know what? Forget it. Forget this whole thing ever even happened. I\u2019m done. Have a nice life. Keep in touch, yeah?\u201d She mimicked in a deep manly voice as she stepped into her Range Rover. </p>\n\n<p>As soon as she pulled out of the drive, H lost it.

Which means he has a stellium (4 or more planets) in Aquarius.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>To answer your initial question, the reason Harry appears to be more structured than your typical Aquarius, is because his mercury and Saturn are conjunct (side by side, or appearing conjoined). Mercury is the planet of communication, how we verbally express ourselves and how we think. Saturn is quite literally the planet of structure, of lessons, rules. Saturn is the task master. Having the permanent energy of structure in direct contact with the energy of the mind creates.. a very structured mind. This man has a VERY serious brain.\n\n Someone who enjoys discipline, who follows rules, who wants things to be done <i>right</i>. He will expect to be taken and treated as an authority figure.</p><p>In his younger years, before maturity, it may have appeared that he learned a bit slower.\u00a0He may have stuttered a bit or appeared to have had trouble forming sentences. The reason for this is because Saturn\u2019s energy is <i>heavy. </i>That slow Harry Styles drawl that we now know and love, that deep voice, is all thanks to the conjunction of his Mercury to his Saturn. As he grows and gets older, with the fusing of these two energies, he will become more and more confident in his own thoughts and in his mind. Experience is key for someone like Harry to really grow and cultivate his confidence.\u00a0</p><p>Another thing that makes Harry seem a little different than the typical Aquarius (though he is still very much an Aquarius), is the fact that he has three of his Aquarian planets in the 4th house. The house that a planet resides in can have a very large effect on that planet, or in Harry\u2019s case, multiple planets. The 4th house is a water house, traditionally ruled by the Moon. The moon governs over emotions (and of the mother, and home. These placements would make Harry a giant Mama\u2019s boy). Him having multiple planets in the literal house of emotions is going to make him an emotional person, even with him being an Aquarius, which is an air sign typically known as the most\u00a0\u201caloof\u201d sign. It creates a mixture that is somewhat Aquarius, somewhat Cancer in nature. That cancer, or moon, energy, will create A LOT of drive in him, as cancers are typically one of the most driven signs. Any planets that fall in the 4th house will have some cancer-like qualities.\u00a0</p><p>With that same thought in mind, look to his actual moon, which is in the sign of Libra, another air sign. His moon resides in the 12th house.. the 12th house is ALSO a water house, creating a moon that carries some Libra like tendencies, mixed with some Pisces like tendencies, in his emotions. So you have almost ALL of his personal planets in water houses, including his moon itself, and this makes for a very emotional Aquarius.</p><p>I know those last two paragraphs weren\u2019t part of the question, but I used to wonder before I ever looked at his chart, why he seemed more emotional than the typical Aquarius, and.. well, if you ever wondered, too, then this is why.\u00a0</p>",
