(PHOTO: Matt Murphy)</figcaption><p>Not many directors can say they have bragging rights, having crossed the same path as author J. K. Rowling before, like John Tiffany. He was in Edinburgh about 20 years ago, at a cafe bar for meetings when he spotted a familiar face, at the same corner, writing away for three hours. \u201cAnd about 18 months later, she had stopped coming in, but I saw her face in the papers and she\u2019d written this book<i> Harry Potter and The Philosopher\u2019s Stone</i>. And I was like, \u2018oh, wow, because I thought she was like, in some terrible play!\u201d he shared his shock with the members of the press, who was there to witness the play in the region for the first time.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4480\" data-orig-width=\"6673\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a3141bfdd8e82c224d48cbf5ea5529bb\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd80322a5e121e82e31237c10870d1e4/tumblr_inline_poi291xOGy1uxfms1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4480\" data-orig-width=\"6673\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a3141bfdd8e82c224d48cbf5ea5529bb\"/></figure><figcaption>William McKenna as Scorpius Malfoy, Tom Wren as Draco Malfoy, Lucy Goleby as Ginny Potter, Gareth Reeves as Harry Potter, Sean Rees-Wemyss as Albus Potter, Gyton Grantley as Ron Weasley and Paula Arundell as Hermione Granger.

Together with Rowling, and Jack Thorne, the trio went on to develop the plot of <i>Harry Potter and The Cursed Child </i>(HPATCC) together. Written specifically for the theatre, the play is divided into two parts. Each part goes on for a little over two hours \u2013 fans can watch the play back-to-back or opt to spread it over two days.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3858\" data-orig-width=\"5787\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e8afdd5d31e05c84928e1ab9096b3417\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a76048d5443590c701a834f1a38118d1/tumblr_inline_poi293o18f1uxfms1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3858\" data-orig-width=\"5787\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e8afdd5d31e05c84928e1ab9096b3417\"/></figure><figcaption>Tom Wren as Draco Malfoy. (PHOTO: Matt Murphy)</figcaption><p>Producer Michael Cassel, who has been following the audience\u2019s reaction from the back of the theatre, was intrigued that the loyal fans have not been sharing spoilers: \u201cI have to say, since we began preview performances here just a few weeks ago, it\u2019s been wonderful watching the audience\u2019s come and have their experience of the theatre, and walk out at the end of part one, you know, whispering to each other, \u2018What? Yeah, what\u2019s just happened, what\u2019s going to happen in part two?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Melbourne is the third city in the world to host HPATCC, following London and New York. A San Francisco production has also been announced for 2019, along with the first non-English version of the play in Hamburg. Melbourne\u2019s Princess Theatre carries this play, and the response has been phenomenal; tickets have been hard to get by but it only goes to show the magic of Harry Potter is here to stay.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/5c2245ae2696813dcf2a903005a81dda\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4552c2a7df92343d78d3964f66478935/tumblr_inline_poi294yHd51uxfms1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/5c2245ae2696813dcf2a903005a81dda\"/></figure><figcaption>The writer in front of Princess Theatre. (PHOTO: Yahoo Lifestyle Singapore)</figcaption><p>The 132-year-old theatre had undergone maintenance for over six months since February 2018, which included a complete repainting of the entire facade in the original colours, and utilising a historic \u2018mineral silica\u2019 paint system. Inside the theatre, be sure the spot the Harry Potter \u2018H\u2019 font on the carpets and wallpaper, as well as the \u2018nest\u2019 at the exterior of the theatre. The nest and child together weighs about 1,000kg,  and was first hoisted in London, where it sits on top of the Palace Theatre canopy. In New York, two nests can be found on 42nd Street and atop a billboard site on 43rd Street. </p> <p>The Australian/Kiwi production is made up of a crew of 70 and cast of 42, led by Gareth Reeves as Harry Potter, Lucy Goleby as his wife Ginny Potter and Sean Rees-Wemyss as their son Albus Potter; Gyton Grantley as Ron Weasley, Paula Arundell as Hermione Granger and Manali Datar as their daughter Rose Granger-Weasley; Tom Wren as Draco Malfoy and William McKenna as his son Scorpius Malfoy.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3537\" data-orig-width=\"5251\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/6189cc71dd1b13061b41d15e17ea358a\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5cee83b8975550162597d2d2ad0a0a5/tumblr_inline_poi29603P91uxfms1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3537\" data-orig-width=\"5251\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/6189cc71dd1b13061b41d15e17ea358a\"/></figure><figcaption>A scene from the play. (PHOTO: Matt Murphy)</figcaption><p><strong>#keepthesecrets</strong></p> <p>The storyline follows Harry Potter\u2019s son Albus Severus, who is a true rebel at heart, but enrols at Hogwarts just like his father, and meets Scorpius Malfoy, (yes Harry\u2019s nemesis Draco\u2019s son). They both form a strong friendship which leads them to an interesting maze of self-discovery, loyalty and smarts.</p> <p>As a newbie who\u2019s not read the books, nor watch the films, the storyline for HPATCC was easy to follow \u2013 each character has enough stage time to build out the specifics of their roles \u2013 but I\u2019d missed certain throwbacks relevant to the films. Still, what I really like was the choreography surrounding the props, a mastery of the dance and movements in flowy capes and gowns, which you could tell it was beautifully made to measure. There were a few \u2018magical\u2019 moments on stage, theatre tricks if we must say, but I won\u2019t spoil it for you.</p> <p><em><strong>This trip was sponsored by Visit Victoria and Qantas Airways.

Inside the theatre, be sure the spot the Harry Potter \u2018H\u2019 font on the carpets and wallpaper, as well as the \u2018nest\u2019 at the exterior of the theatre. The nest and child together weighs about 1,000kg,  and was first hoisted in London, where it sits on top of the Palace Theatre canopy. In New York, two nests can be found on 42nd Street and atop a billboard site on 43rd Street. </p> <p>The Australian/Kiwi production is made up of a crew of 70 and cast of 42, led by Gareth Reeves as Harry Potter, Lucy Goleby as his wife Ginny Potter and Sean Rees-Wemyss as their son Albus Potter; Gyton Grantley as Ron Weasley, Paula Arundell as Hermione Granger and Manali Datar as their daughter Rose Granger-Weasley; Tom Wren as Draco Malfoy and William McKenna as his son Scorpius Malfoy.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3537\" data-orig-width=\"5251\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/6189cc71dd1b13061b41d15e17ea358a\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5cee83b8975550162597d2d2ad0a0a5/tumblr_inline_poi29603P91uxfms1_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3537\" data-orig-width=\"5251\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/6189cc71dd1b13061b41d15e17ea358a\"></figure><figcaption>A scene from the play. (PHOTO: Matt Murphy)</figcaption><p><strong>#keepthesecrets</strong></p> <p>The storyline follows Harry Potter\u2019s son Albus Severus, who is a true rebel at heart, but enrols at Hogwarts just like his father, and meets Scorpius Malfoy, (yes Harry\u2019s nemesis Draco\u2019s son). They both form a strong friendship which leads them to an interesting maze of self-discovery, loyalty and smarts.</p> <p>As a newbie who\u2019s not read the books, nor watch the films, the storyline for HPATCC was easy to follow \u2013 each character has enough stage time to build out the specifics of their roles \u2013 but I\u2019d missed certain throwbacks relevant to the films. Still, what I really like was the choreography surrounding the props, a mastery of the dance and movements in flowy capes and gowns, which you could tell it was beautifully made to measure. There were a few \u2018magical\u2019 moments on stage, theatre tricks if we must say, but I won\u2019t spoil it for you.</p> <p><em><strong>This trip was sponsored by Visit Victoria and Qantas Airways.

Together with Rowling, and Jack Thorne, the trio went on to develop the plot of <i>Harry Potter and The Cursed Child </i>(HPATCC) together.

It wasn&rsquo;t that sensation was being ignored. Quite the contrary. It was only that, though the pleasure of carefully sinking into the scorching silken tightness of a lover for the first time in almost two decades caused his breath to catch in his throat and his limbs to weaken to the point they barely held him, coherent thought never ceased in Remus Lupin. Not when he could help it. Not after so many years of surrendering it to the full moon. Even the slow moan sounding from the sweet, swollen mouth turned modestly into his pillow was not enough to tempt Remus to abandon himself to the bestial. Lust does not necessarily have to be mindless, and few could appreciate this as Remus could.</p><p>And so even as he sank that last inch, even as all power of intelligible speech escaped him and he gazed with glazed and hungry eyes down at the exquisite, delicate grimace on the boy&rsquo;s face, Remus&rsquo; mind functioned perfectly. And it condemned him.</p><p>James would never have forgiven him for this. Ever. But then, if James were living, this situation might never have come about. Sirius might quite possibly have killed him for this, or close enough to it. Though, if Padfoot hadn&rsquo;t been lost, the two would never have been forced into such intimate circumstances. Remus fully appreciated these things, and also that he was betraying the confidence Dumbledore had placed in him when he had appointed him the boy&rsquo;s guardian. Remus fully accepted all the possible implications of this willful and intentional blasphemy, and he reminded himself, with each slow thrust and the whimpers it elicited, of the potential price of this trespass.</p><p>Oh! but it was sweetly urged. By the roll of narrow hips drawing him deeper than he dared himself. By the tentative but wistful touch of fingertips on his face coaxing him forward to crush soft, waiting lips with his own and taste their shudder, drink in their gasp as his fingers gently curled around the boy&rsquo;s weeping prick.</p><p>And he was a boy to Remus, he realised. Never mind that he might have been deemed the contrary by others: a lawful and consenting adult. Compared to Remus, he was a boy. And as the man deliberately crushing this boy&rsquo;s last remaining innocence, Remus asked for forgiveness. Each careful stroke of his hand along his swollen length was an apology: To Harry, for allowing him to waste such a precious moment on an old and lonely man. To the absent friends he was betraying with the act, to anyone who would be disappointed or enraged by this union, to whatever higher power might be listening, Remus apologised&hellip;</p><p>&hellip;For being unrepentant.</p><p>And he was. There was no guilt in him. The excuses he had contrived earlier, that he only wanted to ensure that Harry&rsquo;s first was gentle and loving and everything it should be, had been abandoned before he had ever allowed himself to touch his ward. This was no selfless act. Neither was it the result of a moment of weakness. Remus knew precisely what his intentions were when he first slipped his hand warmly over Harry&rsquo;s, holding his breath to see how he would respond, almost fainting with relief when Harry turned his hand to twine their fingers together. He&rsquo;d known exactly what he was doing when he had reached out tonight and run his hands languidly down Harry&rsquo;s smooth, bare arms and wrapped the youth in a fluid embrace, taking his breath away with a gentle kiss. And he knew precisely why.</p><p>By no means did he expect or even hope this sacrilege would go unpunished. But since he was incapable of genuine contrition, he would have to devise some other means of atonement. In exchange for having this beautiful young man writhing beneath him, gasping his name, Remus would forgo the taming elixir Severus was due to deliver any day now. And in the meantime, he resolved to face, unflinchingly, the gutting torment of seeing those brilliant green eyes shine up at him with trust he knew he didn&rsquo;t deserve.</p><p>Not that this expiation would benefit Harry. It was for his own peace of mind. But then, Remus would be sure Harry never knew it was required, or why. Harry would take as much enjoyment from this as it was possible for him to grant. Remus would never sully its sanctity with confessions.</p><p>Harry would never be given any reason to suspect that Remus was not making love to him but to Lily&rsquo;s eyes and James&rsquo; face and Sirius&rsquo; stubborn passion. He&rsquo;d never know Remus&rsquo; attraction lay in that Harry was the perfect embodiment of all of them; all those whom Remus had loved so well and been denied, who had loved each other but never Remus. Not in this way. More than that, Harry was a pulsing, breathing memory of a time when Remus had last known happiness. Happiness that had been shattered in so many ways by Harry&rsquo;s entrance into this world. Remus didn&rsquo;t blame Harry for his loss. <i>Gods</i>. Of course, not. The thought made him shudder with guilt that he could conceive it. And Harry, so innocent and sweet, mistook the tremor to be one of pleasure and moaned again, cried out as Remus delivered his apology with renewed fervour, and spilled warm over Remus&rsquo; fingers like a kind of absolution.</p><p>If only.</p><p>That hopeful thought was too much for Remus, and he condensed the names of so many ghosts into a single, shattering sob, unable and undaring to utter Harry&rsquo;s own name as he emptied deep inside of him. Spent, he rested against the young man, sweaty and weak-limbed, kissing at the salty beads on Harry&rsquo;s neck, lost in the comfort of trembling arms sliding up to circle his back. Perhaps this sin was not so wicked as it seemed, if Harry enjoyed it as much as he appeared to have. Perhaps Remus could just consider this something beautiful they could share, something worthwhile regardless of motive. Remus allowed himself to be seduced by this thought until Harry&rsquo;s voice, choked and soft in his ear, shattered his contentment.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Remus&rsquo; eyes fell shut. He knew Harry might be waiting for a reply, but he couldn&rsquo;t speak. He only wrapped his arms tightly around the youth, clinging to the dead, and he wept as he kissed him, hoping to stop the words from coming again.

It wasn\u2019t that sensation was being ignored. Quite the contrary. It was only that, though the pleasure of carefully sinking into the scorching silken tightness of a lover for the first time in almost two decades caused his breath to catch in his throat and his limbs to weaken to the point they barely held him, coherent thought never ceased in Remus Lupin. Not when he could help it. Not after so many years of surrendering it to the full moon. Even the slow moan sounding from the sweet, swollen mouth turned modestly into his pillow was not enough to tempt Remus to abandon himself to the bestial. Lust does not necessarily have to be mindless, and few could appreciate this as Remus could.</p><p>And so even as he sank that last inch, even as all power of intelligible speech escaped him and he gazed with glazed and hungry eyes down at the exquisite, delicate grimace on the boy\u2019s face, Remus\u2019 mind functioned perfectly. And it condemned him.</p><p>James would never have forgiven him for this. Ever. But then, if James were living, this situation might never have come about. Sirius might quite possibly have killed him for this, or close enough to it. Though, if Padfoot hadn\u2019t been lost, the two would never have been forced into such intimate circumstances. Remus fully appreciated these things, and also that he was betraying the confidence Dumbledore had placed in him when he had appointed him the boy\u2019s guardian. Remus fully accepted all the possible implications of this willful and intentional blasphemy, and he reminded himself, with each slow thrust and the whimpers it elicited, of the potential price of this trespass.</p><p>Oh! but it was sweetly urged. By the roll of narrow hips drawing him deeper than he dared himself. By the tentative but wistful touch of fingertips on his face coaxing him forward to crush soft, waiting lips with his own and taste their shudder, drink in their gasp as his fingers gently curled around the boy\u2019s weeping prick.</p><p>And he was a boy to Remus, he realised. Never mind that he might have been deemed the contrary by others: a lawful and consenting adult. Compared to Remus, he was a boy. And as the man deliberately crushing this boy\u2019s last remaining innocence, Remus asked for forgiveness. Each careful stroke of his hand along his swollen length was an apology: To Harry, for allowing him to waste such a precious moment on an old and lonely man. To the absent friends he was betraying with the act, to anyone who would be disappointed or enraged by this union, to whatever higher power might be listening, Remus apologised\u2026</p><p>\u2026For being unrepentant.</p><p>And he was. There was no guilt in him. The excuses he had contrived earlier, that he only wanted to ensure that Harry\u2019s first was gentle and loving and everything it should be, had been abandoned before he had ever allowed himself to touch his ward. This was no selfless act. Neither was it the result of a moment of weakness. Remus knew precisely what his intentions were when he first slipped his hand warmly over Harry\u2019s, holding his breath to see how he would respond, almost fainting with relief when Harry turned his hand to twine their fingers together. He\u2019d known exactly what he was doing when he had reached out tonight and run his hands languidly down Harry\u2019s smooth, bare arms and wrapped the youth in a fluid embrace, taking his breath away with a gentle kiss. And he knew precisely why.</p><p>By no means did he expect or even hope this sacrilege would go unpunished. But since he was incapable of genuine contrition, he would have to devise some other means of atonement. In exchange for having this beautiful young man writhing beneath him, gasping his name, Remus would forgo the taming elixir Severus was due to deliver any day now. And in the meantime, he resolved to face, unflinchingly, the gutting torment of seeing those brilliant green eyes shine up at him with trust he knew he didn\u2019t deserve.</p><p>Not that this expiation would benefit Harry. It was for his own peace of mind. But then, Remus would be sure Harry never knew it was required, or why. Harry would take as much enjoyment from this as it was possible for him to grant. Remus would never sully its sanctity with confessions.</p><p>Harry would never be given any reason to suspect that Remus was not making love to him but to Lily\u2019s eyes and James\u2019 face and Sirius\u2019 stubborn passion. He\u2019d never know Remus\u2019 attraction lay in that Harry was the perfect embodiment of all of them; all those whom Remus had loved so well and been denied, who had loved each other but never Remus. Not in this way. More than that, Harry was a pulsing, breathing memory of a time when Remus had last known happiness. Happiness that had been shattered in so many ways by Harry\u2019s entrance into this world. Remus didn\u2019t blame Harry for his loss. <i>Gods</i>. Of course, not. The thought made him shudder with guilt that he could conceive it. And Harry, so innocent and sweet, mistook the tremor to be one of pleasure and moaned again, cried out as Remus delivered his apology with renewed fervour, and spilled warm over Remus\u2019 fingers like a kind of absolution.</p><p>If only.</p><p>That hopeful thought was too much for Remus, and he condensed the names of so many ghosts into a single, shattering sob, unable and undaring to utter Harry\u2019s own name as he emptied deep inside of him. Spent, he rested against the young man, sweaty and weak-limbed, kissing at the salty beads on Harry\u2019s neck, lost in the comfort of trembling arms sliding up to circle his back. Perhaps this sin was not so wicked as it seemed, if Harry enjoyed it as much as he appeared to have. Perhaps Remus could just consider this something beautiful they could share, something worthwhile regardless of motive. Remus allowed himself to be seduced by this thought until Harry\u2019s voice, choked and soft in his ear, shattered his contentment.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Remus\u2019 eyes fell shut. He knew Harry might be waiting for a reply, but he couldn\u2019t speak. He only wrapped his arms tightly around the youth, clinging to the dead, and he wept as he kissed him, hoping to stop the words from coming again. Harry whimpered into his mouth - so, so sweet - and surrendered to tears of his own which Remus promptly kissed away as tenderly as the sweat before, drinking them in like merited poison. And he knew, as he watched Harry sleep after, that he would take this sin again, but that a thousand full moons could never possibly absolve him.</p></p>",
