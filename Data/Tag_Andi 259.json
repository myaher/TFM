TJ swung the door open to reveal his boyfriend and Amber&rsquo;s girlfriend, grinning on their porch.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, babe,&rdquo; TJ greeted, leaning forward to kiss Cyrus as Amber stepped aside so Cyrus and Iris could step into the house. They filed inside, inhaling deeply at the warm scent of cinnamon and sugar filling the house. They glanced around, smiling at the family photos on the walls, spanning all 16 years of TJ and Amber&rsquo;s life.<br /><br />&ldquo;Happy Halloween eve!&rdquo; Iris exclaimed as they took off their coats, hanging them up by the door and toeing off their shoes.<br /><br />&ldquo;Is that actually a thing?&rdquo; TJ asked incredulously, looking over his shoulder as he led the other three into the kitchen, gesturing for them to leave their bags on the couch as the passed.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Cyrus jumped in with a chuckle, setting his bag down. &ldquo;But we can still call it that!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Good plan,&rdquo; Amber replied with a smile, following TJ into the kitchen and standing on one side of the island next to him. Cyrus and Iris stood across from them, looking a little confused.<br /><br />&ldquo;What exactly are we doing?&rdquo; Iris asked, looking around the kitchen.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making pumpkin pie!&rdquo; TJ exclaimed, looking as if his answer was the most obvious one possible.<br /><br />&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we like a month early?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, torn between teasing and genuine confusion. TJ shrugged, opening cabinets and pulling out ingredients.<br /><br />&ldquo;I mean probably, but we had pumkin anyway, and I didn&rsquo;t want to go to the store,&rdquo; he replied, setting a can of pumpkin puree on the island as emphasis.<br /><br />&ldquo;My boyfriend, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; Cyrus turned to Iris and pretended to swoon, holding the back of his hand to his forehead. &ldquo;Such a romantic he is.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, truly,&rdquo; Amber replied, teasing her twin brother gently.<br /><br />&ldquo;You two are terrible,&rdquo; TJ said, laughing. &ldquo;Iris, save me.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I can only try.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Alright, pie is baking, and now we wait,&rdquo; Amber said as she closed the oven door, turning back to the other three.<br /><br />&ldquo;What do we do in the meantime?&rdquo; Cyrus asked. TJ looked at his boyfriend, then himself. A quick glance at the other two confirmed his suspicions, and he bit back a giggle at the sight of the four of them, covered in flour and pumpkin puree.<br /><br />&ldquo;We should probably get cleaned up,&rdquo; he laughed, gesturing to their state. &ldquo;Cy, you managed to get pie crust in your hair,&rdquo; he said, reaching forward to pull the crust from his boyfriend&rsquo;s soft brown hair.<br /><br />&ldquo;Well you have pie filling all over your face,&rdquo; Cyrus retorted, gently swiping his thumb across TJ&rsquo;s cheek to clean away the orange filling.<br /><br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;re adorable,&rdquo; Iris whispered to her girlfriend, watching TJ and Cyrus stare into each other&rsquo;s eyes.<br /><br />&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; Amber argued warmly, resting her head on Iris&rsquo;s shoulder as they leaned against the counter.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a competition, Ambs.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know that!&rdquo; Amber insisted. &ldquo;But if it were&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;d win.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p>",
