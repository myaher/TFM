(yep that&rsquo;s it. I\u2019m not spilling anything else.) <br/><br/><b>Warnings</b>: Lots of swearing, some angst, self-depreciation, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, \u00a0okay maybe a lot of angst, daddy issues(not the sexual kind yall!)

Also please don\u2019t bother requesting smut, I won\u2019t write it</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\u201cHoney, could you please go into my office and grab the white file in the second drawer in my desk? I need it in an hour so please could you make your way here now? I\u2019ll give you the money you need for the tech thing you want so bad! But please hurry!\u201d my mother hung up.</p><p>The woman was amazing at what she did but she was so forgetful, I was amazed at how she hadn&rsquo;t lost her position even after 25 years. My mom worked for S.H.E.I.L.D., she was high up in the ranks. That was all I knew, well actually that\u2019s all they think I know. You see, I\u2019m a pretty techy gal. I am so sorry, did I seriously just say \u2018gal\u2019? Okay yeah so I am very into the tech-verse and yeah I\u2019m very aware that my mom works very closely with Coulson and whatnot but you don\u2019t know that either okay! Now shush I have to go! Before you ask, yes I do know where they are because as her immediate and only family. I was to come to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters if anything were to ever go wrong. If you asked me, S.H.E.I.L.D. was the last place we should be at. With all the rogue agents and undercover Hydras. Shit. YOU DON&rsquo;T KNOW THAT EITHER OKAY! While I was spilling dirt that only I know, you didn&rsquo;t notice me start the car, did you? I hated going to S.H.E.I.L.D. so much. It was such a headache to get there. The idiots made it so you had to take about 120 backroads to get to the damn place. It was so stupid.</p><p>I quickly glanced at the duffel bag behind me. I wonder if I\u2019d be allowed to use the training room? I can\u2019t afford to miss today&rsquo;s workout, one workout missed meant a whole fight lost. Not that I was getting into any fights\u2026Okay fine, I box! Erm&hellip; and it might be illegal\u2026 No one needs to know that either by the way! Snitches get stitches! Don&rsquo;t you dare forget! If I ever hear that you\u2019ve let anything slip, I\u2019m also great with weapons. That was indeed a threat, take it to heart.</p><p>I pulled up into the reserved parking space under my name. Grabbing my duffel and the white file with the big red \u2018Confidential\u2019 stamped on it, I swiped my ID into the holder. I was welcomed with a blast of air-conditioned air. They have these set to 16 degrees, and there was an air conditioner every 4 metres. The place was probably colder than Antarctica. Smiling at the receptionist I waved the file at her and she gave me a grimace.</p><p>\u201cLola left the files again?\u201d she asked in a not surprised manner.</p><p>\u201cYep, you know how mom is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on up sweetheart. If anyone asks, tell \u2018em Susan sent you up. They can come and fight me.\u201d</p><p>I threw my head back a little and laughed. Trying to contain my outburst, I grinned at Susan.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sue! I\u2019ll bring you down a coffee, on my way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh honey, you don&rsquo;t have to! Oh, and I didn&rsquo;t tell you this but the training room is free from 4 till 8, so if you wanna punch some stuff, knock yourself out.\u201d Susan whispered.</p><p>I pulled her into a small hug and then ran over to the elevators. I punched in the code and pressed on the floor number. The doors were just about to close when a not so subtle Patriotic soldier managed to place one of his feet in between the doors. He had been awake for a few months now. 3 to be exact, not that I\u2019ve been digging or anything. I was a tad bit uncomfortable considering I looked like shit today. I looked terrible on a daily basis considering I was a fat fuck but today I was actually shit. He had taken his stance behind me, which made me x999 times more uncomfortable than I had in the beginning. I could also feel him staring which made my nerves increase even more. I was hoping that the ride down would stay quiet but unfortunately, to my dismay, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cAre you new here?\u201d he asked, voice smoother than silk. Yikes.</p><p>\u201cI think I should be the one asking you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He seemed a little shocked that I didn\u2019t give him a straight up answer. However, he hummed in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI guess you should, I was here just yesterday and I didn\u2019t run into you, that\u2019s why I asked.\u201d he smiled, not a bit of bitchiness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI was off yesterday.\u201d I lied.</p><p>As the elevator doors opened, Captain Not So Frozen stepped out and head to the direction opposite of where I needed to be. PRAISE THE LORRRDDD! Before he opened the door, he spun around and yelled out, \u201cHey! I guess I\u2019ll see you around Miss?\u201d</p><p>I contemplated giving him a fake last name but decided against it.</p><p>\u201cBeaumont\u201d</p><p>Giving me a small smile, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you around Miss Beaumont\u201d</p><p>Besides, it\u2019d be funnier if he ran into my mom, considering she was Miss Beaumont. Ahh, the laughs. I checked my watch, \u20183:47\u2019.</p><p>\u201cPerfect\u201d</p><p>I knocked on the door to my mom\u2019s office, no one came to the door so I let myself in. I left the file between the keyboard and the screen of her closed laptop and wrote her a quick note on a post-it, letting her know where I\u2019d be.</p><p>Lazily stepping into the elevator again I punched in another code and the button for the floor. This time, the melted man didn&rsquo;t stop the closing doors and I was able to get to the gym peacefully.</p><p>I pulled out my laptop from my duffel and started cracking. My \u2018abilities\u2019 weren&rsquo;t known to S.H.E.I.L.D., mom knew I could fight and she knew I was great with tech. What I did with those things, she didn\u2019t know, and to be frank she didn\u2019t need to either. I was done setting up the codes, all I needed was a clear frame. So when I stepped out and opened the doors to the gym, I was relieved to see it was indeed empty.</p><p>\u20184:03\u2019 my watch read. I stepped back outside and set everything else up. I didn\u2019t need these buffoons watching me, and enter.</p><p>\u201cThat gave me such a headache, this stupid place.\u201d</p><p>Manoeuvering my way to the changing room I threw my bag into one of the lockers and then went straight for the treadmill. I had four hours so I could do a lot. I would run/jog for half an hour and then, squats, lunges, one legged squats, box jumps, hip raises, deadlifts, straight leg deadlifts, good mornings, step ups, overhead press, bench press, incline dumbbell press, push ups, dips, chin ups, pull ups, bodyweight rows, dumbbell rows, planks, side planks, exercise ball crunches, mountain climbers, jumping knee tucks, hanging leg raises. Then I\u2019d work on my hapkido if I finished everything nicely. Or I could go crash at my loft. I realised if I went back home, I wouldn&rsquo;t do any hapkido so I decided I\u2019d just cut some stuff out and get to the martial art.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>I finished up the leg raises and checked the time once more.</p><p>\u20186:45\u2019</p><p>That gave me a solid 5-minute break and a 10-minute shower.</p><p>The shower ended quicker than I had planned, eager to practice hapkido again. I changed into something more comfortable. Pulling out a mat I started my usual routine. But I wanted to do something a bit different today. I grabbed one of the knives. I was doing my thing and all when a stupid man decided to grab my attention. I was taken aback and grabbed the blade too hard. Blood dripping from my torn palm, Stark stares at me shocked.</p><p>\u201cShit, I am so sorry!\u201d he tried to clean up my hand using the handkerchief from his pocket.</p><p>I took a step back, glaring fiercely at the idiotic billionaire.</p><p>\u201cI can fix it myself, fuck off Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotty mouth, plus I apologized, didn&rsquo;t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell if you weren&rsquo;t so fucking idiotic and ignorant, we wouldn&rsquo;t really be in this situation now would we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to the infirmary.\u201d he tugged on my arm slightly.</p><p>Pushing his money filthy hands off, I said, \u201cI vividly remember telling you to fuck off. No?\u201d</p><p>He merely smirked at me.</p><p>\u201cBefore I \u2018fuck off\u2019, I wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>Not being bothered to reply to the egotistical fuck, I stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you hack into S.H.E.I.L.D.\u2019S systems?\u201d</p><p>Awh fuck, this is great.</p><p>\u201cHails, wanna tell me how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t you dare call me that you fucking asshat! You don&rsquo;t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing all of my things I stormed out of the anxiety-filled room to be met with another fucker I hate.</p><p>\u201cNicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh Miss Claire, you\u2019re just the person I wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Joe you flatter me, Starkies in the gym if you wanna see the fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, you&rsquo;re the one I was looking for Hailey.\u201d</p><p>Hiding my bitchy feels, I follow Joseph into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up Joe-man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>If Fury thought it\u2019d be better to talk about whatever he wanted to talk about specifically in his office, it meant that this thing was big. And very confidential. If I said that it didn\u2019t scare me, I\u2019d be 100% lying. It scared the shit outta me. Fury and I, well we go way back. He\u2019s known me since I was in the womb, and we\u2019ve been super chill. So fuck yeah I was stressed.</p><p>I followed the fucker into his office and took a seat. I was not about to risk falling on my fat ass.</p><p>\u201cMiss Beaumont-\u201d</p><p>\u201cZhang.\u201d I reminded the ignorant man.</p><p>\u201cMiss Zhang, I know you\u2019re aware that I know about your skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? Thought it was a mutual agreement where I don\u2019t fuck your organization over and we keep my \u2018skills\u2019 a fucking secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was until the Avengers.I\u2019d brief you on the whole thing, but something tells me you already know way too much.\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes glued to him, not looking away for even a second. I was proud of my abilities and plus, he never told me to keep out of anything.</p><p>\u201cListen, you already have a bunch of power puffs and musketeers. What do you need me for? Plus, isn\u2019t there some rule that you can\u2019t work for S.H.I.E.L.D. unless you\u2019re twenty-five plus? HA BITCH! I\u2019m still 22!\u201d Crossing my legs, I smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cThat rule is bullshit and I know you know it and fine. I\u2019ll just tell your mom about your pastime activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn&rsquo;t dare!\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI would if it meant you\u2019d join the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause pointing you to the Skull-topuses arent enough? Now I have to join a stupid marching band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey.\u201d</p><p>That shut me up. But before he could say anything else I yelled, \u00a0\u201cFINE! Fuck you, I\u2019ll do it. Not like you\u2019ve actually given me a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the meeting room in an hour\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Zhang\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an agent bitch.\u201d</p><p>Mentally giving myself a once over I tell him, \u201cTomorrow. You want me to be a part of this pep squad? Then I want the meeting tomorrow at 7.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSevens a bit-\u201d</p><p>\u201c8:45 or else I&rsquo;m out.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes he huffed out a \u2018fine\u2019.</p><p>Standing up, I grabbed my bag and pushed through the double doors. The elevator ride pissed me off. I threw myself out of the elevator when I ran into a chiselled figure and fell back. I braced for impact considering I couldn&rsquo;t do a double flip to save myself because I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to know how. But the impact never came. Instead, I felt strong arms hold up my weight. Staring into steely blue eyes I realise who\u2019s holding me. I push him off and let myself fall to the ground. Hanging my head in shame, I stutter a sorry.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine. I just need some air.\u201d</p><p>I ignore his gaze, I push past the man and rushed out of the building. I ran to my car and turned on the engine. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe, fuck. I reversed and then pulled out onto the highway. I kept driving until I realised my eyes were getting clouded and I was about to throw up. I stopped on the side as soon as I exit the highway. My chest hurts, I can\u2019t breathe. I threw myself out of the car and collapsed.</p><p>I woke up to red and blue accompanied with blaring sirens.</p><p>\u201cMiss are you alright?\u201d</p><p>This was embarrassing\u2026 I passed out on the road and someone had called 911. Fucking shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re just going to do a couple tests and if everything\u2019s fine we\u2019ll let you go. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him weakly, nodding my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you able to stand?\u201d she asked very politely.</p><p>As I tried to stand, I almost fell back but the woman had caught your arm before you did. You could feel your throat close up again. She sensed something was wrong and quickly let go, but only after she made sure you were steady.</p><p>After all the tests, I walked over to my car and as I put on my seatbelt, the paramedic who tended to me knocked on my window.</p><p>\u201cHey, if you ever want to speak to anyone about anything, here\u2019s my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no that\u2019s- it\u2019s- I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s okay!\u201d I tried being peppy.</p><p>It clearly didn\u2019t work as her brows furrowed deeper. Sighing I took her card and mumbled a thank you. She gave me a bright smile as I drove away from the\u00a0area. I was definitely not calling her, but for some reason, I just shoved the cared into the glove compartment instead of throwing it out.\u00a0</p>",

Also please don\u2019t bother requesting smut, I won\u2019t write it</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cHoney, could you please go into my office and grab the white file in the second drawer in my desk? I need it in an hour so please could you make your way here now? I\u2019ll give you the money you need for the tech thing you want so bad! But please hurry!\u201d my mother hung up.</p><p>The woman was amazing at what she did but she was so forgetful, I was amazed at how she hadn\u2019t lost her position even after 25 years. My mom worked for S.H.E.I.L.D., she was high up in the ranks. That was all I knew, well actually that\u2019s all they think I know. You see, I\u2019m a pretty techy gal. I am so sorry, did I seriously just say \u2018gal\u2019? Okay yeah so I am very into the tech-verse and yeah I\u2019m very aware that my mom works very closely with Coulson and whatnot but you don\u2019t know that either okay! Now shush I have to go! Before you ask, yes I do know where they are because as her immediate and only family. I was to come to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters if anything were to ever go wrong. If you asked me, S.H.E.I.L.D. was the last place we should be at. With all the rogue agents and undercover Hydras. Shit. YOU DON\u2019T KNOW THAT EITHER OKAY! While I was spilling dirt that only I know, you didn\u2019t notice me start the car, did you? I hated going to S.H.E.I.L.D. so much. It was such a headache to get there. The idiots made it so you had to take about 120 backroads to get to the damn place. It was so stupid.</p><p>I quickly glanced at the duffel bag behind me. I wonder if I\u2019d be allowed to use the training room? I can\u2019t afford to miss today\u2019s workout, one workout missed meant a whole fight lost. Not that I was getting into any fights\u2026Okay fine, I box! Erm\u2026 and it might be illegal\u2026 No one needs to know that either by the way! Snitches get stitches! Don\u2019t you dare forget! If I ever hear that you\u2019ve let anything slip, I\u2019m also great with weapons. That was indeed a threat, take it to heart.</p><p>I pulled up into the reserved parking space under my name. Grabbing my duffel and the white file with the big red \u2018Confidential\u2019 stamped on it, I swiped my ID into the holder. I was welcomed with a blast of air-conditioned air. They have these set to 16 degrees, and there was an air conditioner every 4 metres. The place was probably colder than Antarctica.

Thought it was a mutual agreement where I don\u2019t fuck your organization over and we keep my \u2018skills\u2019 a fucking secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was until the Avengers.I\u2019d brief you on the whole thing, but something tells me you already know way too much.\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes glued to him, not looking away for even a second. I was proud of my abilities and plus, he never told me to keep out of anything.</p><p>\u201cListen, you already have a bunch of power puffs and musketeers. What do you need me for? Plus, isn\u2019t there some rule that you can\u2019t work for S.H.I.E.L.D. unless you\u2019re twenty-five plus? HA BITCH! I\u2019m still 22!\u201d Crossing my legs, I smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cThat rule is bullshit and I know you know it and fine. I\u2019ll just tell your mom about your pastime activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI would if it meant you\u2019d join the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause pointing you to the Skull-topuses arent enough? Now I have to join a stupid marching band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey.\u201d</p><p>That shut me up. But before he could say anything else I yelled, \u00a0\u201cFINE! Fuck you, I\u2019ll do it. Not like you\u2019ve actually given me a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the meeting room in an hour\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Zhang\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an agent bitch.\u201d</p><p>Mentally giving myself a once over I tell him, \u201cTomorrow. You want me to be a part of this pep squad? Then I want the meeting tomorrow at 7.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSevens a bit-\u201d</p><p>\u201c8:45 or else I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes he huffed out a \u2018fine\u2019.</p><p>Standing up, I grabbed my bag and pushed through the double doors. The elevator ride pissed me off. I threw myself out of the elevator when I ran into a chiselled figure and fell back. I braced for impact considering I couldn\u2019t do a double flip to save myself because I wasn\u2019t supposed to know how. But the impact never came. Instead, I felt strong arms hold up my weight. Staring into steely blue eyes I realise who\u2019s holding me. I push him off and let myself fall to the ground. Hanging my head in shame, I stutter a sorry.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine. I just need some air.\u201d</p><p>I ignore his gaze, I push past the man and rushed out of the building. I ran to my car and turned on the engine. I couldn\u2019t breathe, fuck. I reversed and then pulled out onto the highway. I kept driving until I realised my eyes were getting clouded and I was about to throw up. I stopped on the side as soon as I exit the highway. My chest hurts, I can\u2019t breathe. I threw myself out of the car and collapsed.</p><p>I woke up to red and blue accompanied with blaring sirens.</p><p>\u201cMiss are you alright?\u201d</p><p>This was embarrassing\u2026 I passed out on the road and someone had called 911. Fucking shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re just going to do a couple tests and if everything\u2019s fine we\u2019ll let you go. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him weakly, nodding my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you able to stand?\u201d she asked very politely.</p><p>As I tried to stand, I almost fell back but the woman had caught your arm before you did. You could feel your throat close up again. She sensed something was wrong and quickly let go, but only after she made sure you were steady.</p><p>After all the tests, I walked over to my car and as I put on my seatbelt, the paramedic who tended to me knocked on my window.</p><p>\u201cHey, if you ever want to speak to anyone about anything, here\u2019s my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no that\u2019s- it\u2019s- I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s okay!\u201d I tried being peppy.</p><p>It clearly didn\u2019t work as her brows furrowed deeper. Sighing I took her card and mumbled a thank you. She gave me a bright smile as I drove away from the\u00a0area. I was definitely not calling her, but for some reason, I just shoved the cared into the glove compartment instead of throwing it out.\u00a0</p></p>",

DM ME WITH FEEDBACK OR JUST URGHFHJH FEEDBACK PLEASE JELLIES!! Also please don\u2019t bother requesting smut, I won\u2019t write it</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cHoney, could you please go into my office and grab the white file in the second drawer in my desk? I need it in an hour so please could you make your way here now? I\u2019ll give you the money you need for the tech thing you want so bad! But please hurry!\u201d my mother hung up.</p><p>The woman was amazing at what she did but she was so forgetful, I was amazed at how she hadn\u2019t lost her position even after 25 years. My mom worked for S.H.E.I.L.D., she was high up in the ranks. That was all I knew, well actually that\u2019s all they think I know. You see, I\u2019m a pretty techy gal. I am so sorry, did I seriously just say \u2018gal\u2019? Okay yeah so I am very into the tech-verse and yeah I\u2019m very aware that my mom works very closely with Coulson and whatnot but you don\u2019t know that either okay! Now shush I have to go! Before you ask, yes I do know where they are because as her immediate and only family. I was to come to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters if anything were to ever go wrong. If you asked me, S.H.E.I.L.D. was the last place we should be at. With all the rogue agents and undercover Hydras. Shit. YOU DON\u2019T KNOW THAT EITHER OKAY! While I was spilling dirt that only I know, you didn\u2019t notice me start the car, did you? I hated going to S.H.E.I.L.D. so much. It was such a headache to get there. The idiots made it so you had to take about 120 backroads to get to the damn place. It was so stupid.</p><p>I quickly glanced at the duffel bag behind me. I wonder if I\u2019d be allowed to use the training room? I can\u2019t afford to miss today\u2019s workout, one workout missed meant a whole fight lost. Not that I was getting into any fights\u2026Okay fine, I box! Erm\u2026 and it might be illegal\u2026 No one needs to know that either by the way! Snitches get stitches! Don\u2019t you dare forget! If I ever hear that you\u2019ve let anything slip, I\u2019m also great with weapons. That was indeed a threat, take it to heart.</p><p>I pulled up into the reserved parking space under my name. Grabbing my duffel and the white file with the big red \u2018Confidential\u2019 stamped on it, I swiped my ID into the holder. I was welcomed with a blast of air-conditioned air. They have these set to 16 degrees, and there was an air conditioner every 4 metres. The place was probably colder than Antarctica. Smiling at the receptionist I waved the file at her and she gave me a grimace.</p><p>\u201cLola left the files again?\u201d she asked in a not surprised manner.</p><p>\u201cYep, you know how mom is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on up sweetheart. If anyone asks, tell \u2018em Susan sent you up. They can come and fight me.\u201d</p><p>I threw my head back a little and laughed. Trying to contain my outburst, I grinned at Susan.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sue! I\u2019ll bring you down a coffee, on my way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh honey, you don\u2019t have to! Oh, and I didn\u2019t tell you this but the training room is free from 4 till 8, so if you wanna punch some stuff, knock yourself out.\u201d Susan whispered.</p><p>I pulled her into a small hug and then ran over to the elevators. I punched in the code and pressed on the floor number. The doors were just about to close when a not so subtle Patriotic soldier managed to place one of his feet in between the doors. He had been awake for a few months now. 3 to be exact, not that I\u2019ve been digging or anything. I was a tad bit uncomfortable considering I looked like shit today. I looked terrible on a daily basis considering I was a fat fuck but today I was actually shit. He had taken his stance behind me, which made me x999 times more uncomfortable than I had in the beginning. I could also feel him staring which made my nerves increase even more. I was hoping that the ride down would stay quiet but unfortunately, to my dismay, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cAre you new here?\u201d he asked, voice smoother than silk. Yikes.</p><p>\u201cI think I should be the one asking you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He seemed a little shocked that I didn\u2019t give him a straight up answer. However, he hummed in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI guess you should, I was here just yesterday and I didn\u2019t run into you, that\u2019s why I asked.\u201d he smiled, not a bit of bitchiness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI was off yesterday.\u201d I lied.</p><p>As the elevator doors opened, Captain Not So Frozen stepped out and head to the direction opposite of where I needed to be. PRAISE THE LORRRDDD! Before he opened the door, he spun around and yelled out, \u201cHey! I guess I\u2019ll see you around Miss?\u201d</p><p>I contemplated giving him a fake last name but decided against it.</p><p>\u201cBeaumont\u201d</p><p>Giving me a small smile, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you around Miss Beaumont\u201d</p><p>Besides, it\u2019d be funnier if he ran into my mom, considering she was Miss Beaumont. Ahh, the laughs. I checked my watch, \u20183:47\u2019.</p><p>\u201cPerfect\u201d</p><p>I knocked on the door to my mom\u2019s office, no one came to the door so I let myself in. I left the file between the keyboard and the screen of her closed laptop and wrote her a quick note on a post-it, letting her know where I\u2019d be.</p><p>Lazily stepping into the elevator again I punched in another code and the button for the floor. This time, the melted man didn\u2019t stop the closing doors and I was able to get to the gym peacefully.</p><p>I pulled out my laptop from my duffel and started cracking. My \u2018abilities\u2019 weren\u2019t known to S.H.E.I.L.D., mom knew I could fight and she knew I was great with tech. What I did with those things, she didn\u2019t know, and to be frank she didn\u2019t need to either. I was done setting up the codes, all I needed was a clear frame. So when I stepped out and opened the doors to the gym, I was relieved to see it was indeed empty.</p><p>\u20184:03\u2019 my watch read. I stepped back outside and set everything else up. I didn\u2019t need these buffoons watching me, and enter.</p><p>\u201cThat gave me such a headache, this stupid place.\u201d</p><p>Manoeuvering my way to the changing room I threw my bag into one of the lockers and then went straight for the treadmill. I had four hours so I could do a lot. I would run/jog for half an hour and then, squats, lunges, one legged squats, box jumps, hip raises, deadlifts, straight leg deadlifts, good mornings, step ups, overhead press, bench press, incline dumbbell press, push ups, dips, chin ups, pull ups, bodyweight rows, dumbbell rows, planks, side planks, exercise ball crunches, mountain climbers, jumping knee tucks, hanging leg raises. Then I\u2019d work on my hapkido if I finished everything nicely. Or I could go crash at my loft. I realised if I went back home, I wouldn\u2019t do any hapkido so I decided I\u2019d just cut some stuff out and get to the martial art.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>I finished up the leg raises and checked the time once more.</p><p>\u20186:45\u2019</p><p>That gave me a solid 5-minute break and a 10-minute shower.</p><p>The shower ended quicker than I had planned, eager to practice hapkido again. I changed into something more comfortable. Pulling out a mat I started my usual routine. But I wanted to do something a bit different today. I grabbed one of the knives. I was doing my thing and all when a stupid man decided to grab my attention. I was taken aback and grabbed the blade too hard. Blood dripping from my torn palm, Stark stares at me shocked.</p><p>\u201cShit, I am so sorry!\u201d he tried to clean up my hand using the handkerchief from his pocket.</p><p>I took a step back, glaring fiercely at the idiotic billionaire.</p><p>\u201cI can fix it myself, fuck off Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotty mouth, plus I apologized, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell if you weren\u2019t so fucking idiotic and ignorant, we wouldn\u2019t really be in this situation now would we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to the infirmary.\u201d he tugged on my arm slightly.</p><p>Pushing his money filthy hands off, I said, \u201cI vividly remember telling you to fuck off. No?\u201d</p><p>He merely smirked at me.</p><p>\u201cBefore I \u2018fuck off\u2019, I wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>Not being bothered to reply to the egotistical fuck, I stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you hack into S.H.E.I.L.D.\u2019S systems?\u201d</p><p>Awh fuck, this is great.</p><p>\u201cHails, wanna tell me how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me that you fucking asshat! You don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing all of my things I stormed out of the anxiety-filled room to be met with another fucker I hate.</p><p>\u201cNicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh Miss Claire, you\u2019re just the person I wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Joe you flatter me, Starkies in the gym if you wanna see the fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, you\u2019re the one I was looking for Hailey.\u201d</p><p>Hiding my bitchy feels, I follow Joseph into the elevator.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up Joe-man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>If Fury thought it\u2019d be better to talk about whatever he wanted to talk about specifically in his office, it meant that this thing was big. And very confidential. If I said that it didn\u2019t scare me, I\u2019d be 100% lying. It scared the shit outta me. Fury and I, well we go way back. He\u2019s known me since I was in the womb, and we\u2019ve been super chill. So fuck yeah I was stressed.</p><p>I followed the fucker into his office and took a seat. I was not about to risk falling on my fat ass.</p><p>\u201cMiss Beaumont-\u201d</p><p>\u201cZhang.\u201d I reminded the ignorant man.</p><p>\u201cMiss Zhang, I know you\u2019re aware that I know about your skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? Thought it was a mutual agreement where I don\u2019t fuck your organization over and we keep my \u2018skills\u2019 a fucking secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was until the Avengers.I\u2019d brief you on the whole thing, but something tells me you already know way too much.\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes glued to him, not looking away for even a second.

I\u2019m still 22!\u201d Crossing my legs, I smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cThat rule is bullshit and I know you know it and fine. I\u2019ll just tell your mom about your pastime activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI would if it meant you\u2019d join the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause pointing you to the Skull-topuses arent enough? Now I have to join a stupid marching band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey.\u201d</p><p>That shut me up. But before he could say anything else I yelled, \u00a0\u201cFINE! Fuck you, I\u2019ll do it. Not like you\u2019ve actually given me a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the meeting room in an hour\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Zhang\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an agent bitch.\u201d</p><p>Mentally giving myself a once over I tell him, \u201cTomorrow. You want me to be a part of this pep squad? Then I want the meeting tomorrow at 7.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSevens a bit-\u201d</p><p>\u201c8:45 or else I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes he huffed out a \u2018fine\u2019.</p><p>Standing up, I grabbed my bag and pushed through the double doors. The elevator ride pissed me off. I threw myself out of the elevator when I ran into a chiselled figure and fell back. I braced for impact considering I couldn\u2019t do a double flip to save myself because I wasn\u2019t supposed to know how. But the impact never came. Instead, I felt strong arms hold up my weight. Staring into steely blue eyes I realise who\u2019s holding me. I push him off and let myself fall to the ground. Hanging my head in shame, I stutter a sorry.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine. I just need some air.\u201d</p><p>I ignore his gaze, I push past the man and rushed out of the building. I ran to my car and turned on the engine. I couldn\u2019t breathe, fuck. I reversed and then pulled out onto the highway. I kept driving until I realised my eyes were getting clouded and I was about to throw up. I stopped on the side as soon as I exit the highway. My chest hurts, I can\u2019t breathe.

Fucking shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re just going to do a couple tests and if everything\u2019s fine we\u2019ll let you go.

DM ME WITH FEEDBACK OR JUST URGHFHJH FEEDBACK PLEASE JELLIES!! Also please don&rsquo;t bother requesting smut, I won&rsquo;t write it</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, could you please go into my office and grab the white file in the second drawer in my desk? I need it in an hour so please could you make your way here now? I&rsquo;ll give you the money you need for the tech thing you want so bad! But please hurry!&rdquo; my mother hung up.</p><p>The woman was amazing at what she did but she was so forgetful, I was amazed at how she hadn&rsquo;t lost her position even after 25 years. My mom worked for S.H.E.I.L.D., she was high up in the ranks. That was all I knew, well actually that&rsquo;s all they think I know. You see, I&rsquo;m a pretty techy gal. I am so sorry, did I seriously just say &lsquo;gal&rsquo;? Okay yeah so I am very into the tech-verse and yeah I&rsquo;m very aware that my mom works very closely with Coulson and whatnot but you don&rsquo;t know that either okay! Now shush I have to go! Before you ask, yes I do know where they are because as her immediate and only family. I was to come to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters if anything were to ever go wrong. If you asked me, S.H.E.I.L.D. was the last place we should be at. With all the rogue agents and undercover Hydras. Shit. YOU DON&rsquo;T KNOW THAT EITHER OKAY! While I was spilling dirt that only I know, you didn&rsquo;t notice me start the car, did you? I hated going to S.H.E.I.L.D. so much. It was such a headache to get there. The idiots made it so you had to take about 120 backroads to get to the damn place. It was so stupid.</p><p>I quickly glanced at the duffel bag behind me. I wonder if I&rsquo;d be allowed to use the training room? I can&rsquo;t afford to miss today&rsquo;s workout, one workout missed meant a whole fight lost. Not that I was getting into any fights&hellip;Okay fine, I box! Erm&hellip; and it might be illegal&hellip; No one needs to know that either by the way! Snitches get stitches! Don&rsquo;t you dare forget! If I ever hear that you&rsquo;ve let anything slip, I&rsquo;m also great with weapons. That was indeed a threat, take it to heart.</p><p>I pulled up into the reserved parking space under my name. Grabbing my duffel and the white file with the big red &lsquo;Confidential&rsquo; stamped on it, I swiped my ID into the holder. I was welcomed with a blast of air-conditioned air. They have these set to 16 degrees, and there was an air conditioner every 4 metres. The place was probably colder than Antarctica. Smiling at the receptionist I waved the file at her and she gave me a grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;Lola left the files again?&rdquo; she asked in a not surprised manner.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, you know how mom is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on up sweetheart. If anyone asks, tell &lsquo;em Susan sent you up. They can come and fight me.&rdquo;</p><p>I threw my head back a little and laughed. Trying to contain my outburst, I grinned at Susan.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Sue! I&rsquo;ll bring you down a coffee, on my way back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh honey, you don&rsquo;t have to! Oh, and I didn&rsquo;t tell you this but the training room is free from 4 till 8, so if you wanna punch some stuff, knock yourself out.&rdquo; Susan whispered.</p><p>I pulled her into a small hug and then ran over to the elevators. I punched in the code and pressed on the floor number. The doors were just about to close when a not so subtle Patriotic soldier managed to place one of his feet in between the doors. He had been awake for a few months now. 3 to be exact, not that I&rsquo;ve been digging or anything. I was a tad bit uncomfortable considering I looked like shit today. I looked terrible on a daily basis considering I was a fat fuck but today I was actually shit. He had taken his stance behind me, which made me x999 times more uncomfortable than I had in the beginning. I could also feel him staring which made my nerves increase even more. I was hoping that the ride down would stay quiet but unfortunately, to my dismay, he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you new here?&rdquo; he asked, voice smoother than silk. Yikes.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I should be the one asking you, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed a little shocked that I didn&rsquo;t give him a straight up answer. However, he hummed in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you should, I was here just yesterday and I didn&rsquo;t run into you, that&rsquo;s why I asked.&rdquo; he smiled, not a bit of bitchiness in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I was off yesterday.&rdquo; I lied.</p><p>As the elevator doors opened, Captain Not So Frozen stepped out and head to the direction opposite of where I needed to be. PRAISE THE LORRRDDD! Before he opened the door, he spun around and yelled out, &ldquo;Hey! I guess I&rsquo;ll see you around Miss?&rdquo;</p><p>I contemplated giving him a fake last name but decided against it.</p><p>&ldquo;Beaumont&rdquo;</p><p>Giving me a small smile, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you around Miss Beaumont&rdquo;</p><p>Besides, it&rsquo;d be funnier if he ran into my mom, considering she was Miss Beaumont. Ahh, the laughs. I checked my watch, &lsquo;3:47&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect&rdquo;</p><p>I knocked on the door to my mom&rsquo;s office, no one came to the door so I let myself in. I left the file between the keyboard and the screen of her closed laptop and wrote her a quick note on a post-it, letting her know where I&rsquo;d be.</p><p>Lazily stepping into the elevator again I punched in another code and the button for the floor. This time, the melted man didn&rsquo;t stop the closing doors and I was able to get to the gym peacefully.</p><p>I pulled out my laptop from my duffel and started cracking. My &lsquo;abilities&rsquo; weren&rsquo;t known to S.H.E.I.L.D., mom knew I could fight and she knew I was great with tech. What I did with those things, she didn&rsquo;t know, and to be frank she didn&rsquo;t need to either. I was done setting up the codes, all I needed was a clear frame. So when I stepped out and opened the doors to the gym, I was relieved to see it was indeed empty.</p><p>&lsquo;4:03&rsquo; my watch read. I stepped back outside and set everything else up. I didn&rsquo;t need these buffoons watching me, and enter.</p><p>&ldquo;That gave me such a headache, this stupid place.&rdquo;</p><p>Manoeuvering my way to the changing room I threw my bag into one of the lockers and then went straight for the treadmill. I had four hours so I could do a lot. I would run/jog for half an hour and then, squats, lunges, one legged squats, box jumps, hip raises, deadlifts, straight leg deadlifts, good mornings, step ups, overhead press, bench press, incline dumbbell press, push ups, dips, chin ups, pull ups, bodyweight rows, dumbbell rows, planks, side planks, exercise ball crunches, mountain climbers, jumping knee tucks, hanging leg raises. Then I&rsquo;d work on my hapkido if I finished everything nicely. Or I could go crash at my loft. I realised if I went back home, I wouldn&rsquo;t do any hapkido so I decided I&rsquo;d just cut some stuff out and get to the martial art.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>I finished up the leg raises and checked the time once more.</p><p>&lsquo;6:45&rsquo;</p><p>That gave me a solid 5-minute break and a 10-minute shower.</p><p>The shower ended quicker than I had planned, eager to practice hapkido again. I changed into something more comfortable. Pulling out a mat I started my usual routine. But I wanted to do something a bit different today. I grabbed one of the knives. I was doing my thing and all when a stupid man decided to grab my attention. I was taken aback and grabbed the blade too hard. Blood dripping from my torn palm, Stark stares at me shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, I am so sorry!&rdquo; he tried to clean up my hand using the handkerchief from his pocket.</p><p>I took a step back, glaring fiercely at the idiotic billionaire.</p><p>&ldquo;I can fix it myself, fuck off Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Potty mouth, plus I apologized, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well if you weren&rsquo;t so fucking idiotic and ignorant, we wouldn&rsquo;t really be in this situation now would we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to the infirmary.&rdquo; he tugged on my arm slightly.</p><p>Pushing his money filthy hands off, I said, &ldquo;I vividly remember telling you to fuck off. No?&rdquo;</p><p>He merely smirked at me.</p><p>&ldquo;Before I &lsquo;fuck off&rsquo;, I wanted to ask you something.&rdquo;</p><p>Not being bothered to reply to the egotistical fuck, I stayed silent.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you hack into S.H.E.I.L.D.&rsquo;S systems?&rdquo;</p><p>Awh fuck, this is great.</p><p>&ldquo;Hails, wanna tell me how?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare call me that you fucking asshat! You don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>Grabbing all of my things I stormed out of the anxiety-filled room to be met with another fucker I hate.</p><p>&ldquo;Nicholas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah Miss Claire, you&rsquo;re just the person I wanted to see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Joe you flatter me, Starkies in the gym if you wanna see the fucker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you, you&rsquo;re the one I was looking for Hailey.&rdquo;</p><p>Hiding my bitchy feels, I follow Joseph into the elevator.</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s up Joe-man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not here.&rdquo;</p><p>If Fury thought it&rsquo;d be better to talk about whatever he wanted to talk about specifically in his office, it meant that this thing was big. And very confidential. If I said that it didn&rsquo;t scare me, I&rsquo;d be 100% lying. It scared the shit outta me. Fury and I, well we go way back. He&rsquo;s known me since I was in the womb, and we&rsquo;ve been super chill. So fuck yeah I was stressed.</p><p>I followed the fucker into his office and took a seat. I was not about to risk falling on my fat ass.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Beaumont-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Zhang.&rdquo; I reminded the ignorant man.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Zhang, I know you&rsquo;re aware that I know about your skills.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what? Thought it was a mutual agreement where I don&rsquo;t fuck your organization over and we keep my &lsquo;skills&rsquo; a fucking secret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was until the Avengers.I&rsquo;d brief you on the whole thing, but something tells me you already know way too much.&rdquo;</p><p>I kept my eyes glued to him, not looking away for even a second. I was proud of my abilities and plus, he never told me to keep out of anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, you already have a bunch of power puffs and musketeers. What do you need me for? Plus, isn&rsquo;t there some rule that you can&rsquo;t work for S.H.I.E.L.D. unless you&rsquo;re twenty-five plus? HA BITCH! I&rsquo;m still 22!&rdquo; Crossing my legs, I smirked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;That rule is bullshit and I know you know it and fine. I&rsquo;ll just tell your mom about your pastime activities.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo; I glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I would if it meant you&rsquo;d join the Avengers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cause pointing you to the Skull-topuses arent enough? Now I have to join a stupid marching band?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hailey.&rdquo;</p><p>That shut me up. But before he could say anything else I yelled, &nbsp;&ldquo;FINE! Fuck you, I&rsquo;ll do it. Not like you&rsquo;ve actually given me a choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come to the meeting room in an hour&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Zhang&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an agent bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>Mentally giving myself a once over I tell him, &ldquo;Tomorrow. You want me to be a part of this pep squad? Then I want the meeting tomorrow at 7.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sevens a bit-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;8:45 or else I&rsquo;m out.&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling his eyes he huffed out a &lsquo;fine&rsquo;.</p><p>Standing up, I grabbed my bag and pushed through the double doors. The elevator ride pissed me off. I threw myself out of the elevator when I ran into a chiselled figure and fell back. I braced for impact considering I couldn&rsquo;t do a double flip to save myself because I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to know how. But the impact never came. Instead, I felt strong arms hold up my weight. Staring into steely blue eyes I realise who&rsquo;s holding me. I push him off and let myself fall to the ground. Hanging my head in shame, I stutter a sorry.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m fine. I just need some air.&rdquo;</p><p>I ignore his gaze, I push past the man and rushed out of the building. I ran to my car and turned on the engine. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe, fuck. I reversed and then pulled out onto the highway. I kept driving until I realised my eyes were getting clouded and I was about to throw up. I stopped on the side as soon as I exit the highway. My chest hurts, I can&rsquo;t breathe. I threw myself out of the car and collapsed.</p><p>I woke up to red and blue accompanied with blaring sirens.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>This was embarrassing&hellip; I passed out on the road and someone had called 911. Fucking shit.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I nodded curtly.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;re just going to do a couple tests and if everything&rsquo;s fine we&rsquo;ll let you go. Is that okay with you?&rdquo;</p><p>I smiled at him weakly, nodding my head.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you able to stand?&rdquo; she asked very politely.</p><p>As I tried to stand, I almost fell back but the woman had caught your arm before you did.

She gave me a bright smile as I drove away from the&nbsp;area. I was definitely not calling her, but for some reason, I just shoved the cared into the glove compartment instead of throwing it out.&nbsp;</p></p>",
