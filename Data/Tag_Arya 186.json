She\u2019s in protective mode, and that will make it easier for her to read the new arrivals. And if Jon\u2019s instinct is to pay a visit to the crypts, perhaps she could seek him out there. A private reunion would make sense for them. I think they both would appreciate that. It would make it easier for them to be honest with one another too.</p><p>It would also be great for the viewers. We\u2019ve anticipated their reunion for years, and it would be really rewarding for us if that moment was just about them. No distractions, no onlookers, just Jon and Arya.</p><p>And Bran? Yeah, he might sit in his room or by the heart-tree and have Jon come to him. He\u2019s not exactly a sociable person who cares about decorum at the moment, so I could see him not caring to line up with the rest of them to greet the Queen. And, like with Arya, it could be nice for the audience to get a quiet Jon/Bran scene instead of a long moment of Jon going from one person to another. That could easily become tedious and busy.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

Yet the basic understanding of her characterisation is lost on her. I really wish she had read the books.\u00a0 I am going to assume she read the scripts properly at least but it really doesnt seem like it with the recent comments she made on the conflict between Sansa and Arya, (which were very contradictory to the scripts). Truth be told, i always feel like she just repeats things she sees online. Half the things she says, i can literally trace them back to the parts of the fandom she got them from, and the rest is her own personal opinion, influenced heavily by her friendship with Sophie. Which i really dont like. She is an actor who works with the show, and is part of the crew and its her job to provide actual factual insight on to the characters, and be a valid source of information, but she and the general cast of got just share their own opinions or wishes on how they want the characters to be seen. Which is not fair, especially if they havent done their own proper research or provide very bias opinions. Its just very unprofessional in my opinion.\u00a0</p>",
