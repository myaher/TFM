        "body": "<p>I think this needs to be said. Because while the season was going on we didn\u2019t have the ability to see the bigger picture of what was being done in this season. The natural tendency was to interpret Dany\u2019s actions in the episodes as they happened in light of the character as we knew her from s1-s7. And this was especially true for the more dedicated fandom (which is online) where we remember just about every action and incident and tend to have a very fleshed out interpretation of the character. What D&amp;D did was retcon what the character was. Those of us who had spent years analyzing a beloved character were resistant to this and tried to keep interpreting her actions in light of the fairly detailed picture we already had from earlier seasons (and for some of us from the books much before that). As a consequence of this, they changed what Jonerys was as well (how could they not when they have radically altered the character of one of the two main players?). This sends ripples all through the story telling and causes every character\u2019s actions to become difficult to understand. It makes all of them look bad because D&amp;D expected us to suddenly buy this new picture of Dany. We couldn\u2019t see this in episodes 1-3 because episode 3 had hardly any interaction between people, episode 2 had Jon avoiding Dany, and Episode 1 had Jonerys love scenes and we had no idea what was coming so we didn\u2019t interpret things as D&amp;D wanted but rather in continuity with what we knew of Dany (and Jon). But with all of it over, it is now clear what D&amp;D tried to turn Dany into in season 8. Here is what we were asked to swallow:</p><ul><li><b><i>Dany\u2019s exclusive motivation forever has been the Iron Throne. Until she fell in love with Jon</i></b>. Any other motivations (compassion, freeing slaves etc.) or actions are purely in the viewers head and a misinterpretation. What she told Sansa in 8x02 was not a diplomatic decision to leave certain things out (and what diplomatic purpose would be served by leaving her good motivations out anyhow?), but the actual truth about what she thought.</li><li><i><b>Dany is in the North to fight the War against the Dead, not because she has come to believe in the greater importance of Jon\u2019s cause, or any noble motivation</b></i>. In fact that has nothing to do with it (contra what we saw in 7x06). No, <b><i>she is here only out of love of Jon</i></b>.</li><li><b><i>Dany still compelled Jon\u00a0 and demanded he bend the knee as a condition of her help</i></b> (contra 7x06). Hence Jon\u2019s statement in 8x01 that he had to either keep his Crown or save the North was not meant to throw Dany under the bus (as we complained after 8x01) but rather a retcon of what we saw in season 7.</li><li><i><b>Dany is essentially an unfeeling psychopath with respect to all people other than the few she actually cares for and has deep attachments to (e.g. Jorah, Missandei, and most prominently, Jon)</b></i>. The statement by the Samwell Tarly actor after 8x01 was correct in this as far as what the show was actually trying to show us in that scene between Dany and Sam. We didn\u2019t see it that way back then because, once again, that makes no sense with the woman we have come to know in prior seasons. As a result the only things that can be used to motivate her not to act in the worst and most evil ways possible are either pragmatic arguments about how she may be perceived (because she does not want to <i>appear </i>like a psychopath) or the concern that a particular action may make her fall in the eyes of the very few people she actually does care for. Nothing else. No deeper or evolved sense of morality. Retconned out.</li><li><i><b>Dany\u2019s motivations for the throne are purely selfish</b></i>. She is not doing it (even in part) out of any sense of duty to the restoration and continuation of House Targaryen (as, for example, can be argued for others who want to restore the feudal position of their Houses). The fact that she has additional family does not make her happy in the least. There is no conflict in heart whatsoever on the issue. It is just a problem for her pure and simple. The fact that she may have a way to continue the Targaryen dynasty after her (a deep concern for book Dany and even show Dany in 7x07) does not even register. These concerns are gone. Retconned out.</li><li><i><b>Any and every (apparent) act of benevolence or kindness from her is actually nothing more than a manipulative act meant to get her closer to the throne</b></i> (or to tie the few people she loves more closely to her). That is why Sansa\u2019s looks when she legitimizes Gendry are so nasty.</li><li><i><b>Dany is too unwilling to take the opinion of anyone else and will force her own views on anything, even on Jon if they were married</b></i>. She is never going to allow an equal partner in any sense. Forget that she almost accepted every piece of advice he gave her in season 7 when they weren\u2019t even as close as they should be now. Somehow being much more in love will make her less likely to listen to him. Because she has been retconned again.</li><li><b><i>Even her character development about recognizing the Mad King\u2019s evils is reversed</i></b>. Sansa can forgive Jaime\u2019s recent transgressions against her family despite Jaime telling her to her face that he\u2019d do it again coz it was war. But Dany wants to avenge the mad King. No recognition that he was an evil man as she said to Jon in 7x03. And finally</li><li><b><i>Dany actually suffers, at least to some degree, from the old Targaryen madness too,</i></b> and it starts manifesting when she is angry, or unhappy etc.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Now under this re-imagining of Dany\u2019s character, look at what ends up happening to Jonerys as well as Jon:\n\n<br/></p><ul><li><i><b>Jon has basically fallen in love with a woman who is little better (and possibly worse) than Cersei</b></i>. He has also become her advocate and started claiming that she will be a\u00a0\u201cgood Queen\u201d because he actually is, as Maisie Williams said\u00a0\u201cfollowing his dick.\u201d Since Northern independence has been raised to the status of something that is objectively good and beyond any argument, Jon has basically followed his dick in giving it up (since there are actually hardly any redeeming qualities to the woman he has fallen in love with).</li><li><i><b>Jonerys is not a love story between a just woman and an honorable man</b></i>. That was a mistake. Davos was wrong. So were Varys and Tyrion. They were misled by Dany\u2019s charisma and blinded to her true nature (i.e. the retconned nature, not what we have seen in preceding seasons). It is basically a love story between a stupid man (who tries to be honorable) and a woman who tries to project the image of being just for purely manipulative and selfish reasons.\u00a0</li><li><i><b>Dany\u2019s love for Jon is basically intended as some type of abusive and selfish relationship in the end where he will essentially be her \u2018mistress\u2019 since she never even considers mentioning marriage</b></i>. Forget that she felt that even asking Daario to become this would be unfair in 6x10. No, rather we are to accept that it will be just her forcing him to do whatever she wants in every case, and running roughshod over him, ignoring his views and desires whenever they don\u2019t conform with hers and so on. She<i> actually</i> means to threaten Sansa\u2019s life when she says that dragons eat whatever they want. Or tells Jon that if Sansa can\u2019t respect her&hellip; etc. But Jon is so stupidly in love with this woman that he still doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with what she says. Jon\u2019s blindness continues straight into the early parts of 8x06 where he still keeps trying to justify her actions even when seeing clear evidence of her evil in front of his eyes. Of course the audience did not really see it this way either (unless they were already antis) because the Dany we knew would not intend these statements as threats to a member of Jon\u2019s family. So we chose more benign interpretations that made better sense with the Dany we knew from seasons 1-7. However, I don\u2019t think that was what D&amp;D intended for us to see here.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Now, since they cannot show us these things in the short time they have and it is impossible to match what they have shown us in seasons 1-7, the solution is to have people make statements and interpretations for the audience in the hopes that the audience will agree with this. The problem often is that the audience has a hard time buying the negative views of these other characters about Dany as correct because many of us have come to view her far more positively than them!</p><p><b>Take the case of Sansa</b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>Here is what I think D&amp;D wanted us to think</i>: Sansa\u2019s hostile reception towards Dany in 8x01 is completely justified. Dany is in fact a tyrant who likes instilling fear in people (as shown by her smile when Drogon scares people). Sansa is completely right about not trusting Dany\u00a0 and thinking that there is something very wrong and sinister about her and that Jon is just a fool blinded by love for a beautiful woman who cannot see her dark side. Dany\u2019s unwillingness to entertain Sansa\u2019s demand for Northern independence is something sinister about Dany and also shows that all her friendliness towards Sansa is purely false politeness. Sansa is supposed to be the super clever Stark who can see through people while Jon cannot (again we have no evidence for this since we still remember season 7 where only a last minute information dump from Bran was able to save her from getting outplayed by Baelish again). Instead we are now supposed to accept this because Arya (who has met the likes of Tywin Lannister, Jaqen H\u2019ghar, and Littlefinger) says that Sansa is the most clever person she\u2019s ever met. At the same time Sansa is suddenly turned into someone whose motivations are completely pure and above objection. She is not selfish in any sense. This is highlighted when Arya tells Jon not to \u201cforget\u201d that they are his family. Sansa\u2019s concerns are above suspicion. Jon\u2019s motivations are not since he is following his dick. That is what D&amp;D mean for us to see.</p><p>But the thing is, we didn\u2019t see that because we have s1-7 in our memory. We are not convinced that Sansa actually is this super clever person. Instead Arya\u2019s statement about her looks nonsensical to us. We are not convinced that Sansa\u2019s motivations are completely pure. We remember her undermining Jon and wanting to take over the North herself in his absence. We also don\u2019t see Daenerys as this retconned version (i.e. the one I detailed above) in these early episodes that D&amp;D had in mind. The consequence is that Sansa\u2019s actions look extremely stupid and petty to us. She is concerned about Dany, who we consider a heroic character, who is here to help them because of a greater threat (because that was season 7 Dany) when the AotD is coming. Because we haven\u2019t accepted this view of Dany. Instead of accepting that Sansa has a better understanding of Dany, we think she is wrong because we have been familiar with the character for seven seasons. D&amp;D wanted us to think in the other direction. We were supposed to take Sansa\u2019s concerns (expressed to Tyrion in the crypts) about Dany as legitimate and Missandei\u2019s reaction as something that a fanatical follower of Dany might say to them (unlike Tyrion who is supposed to be more rational than a true believer like Missandei). Instead many of us agreed with Missandei.</p><p>Sansa is just one example. Other characters also look bad because of the retcon. Tyrion looks like a complete fool for having bought into the Dany the Savior narrative when he should have known better. His cleverness is nullified. We essentially have Sansa tell him as much (although with respect to Cersei). He seems even more foolish for continuing to expect good things to come from her because he has put his faith in a false savior and cannot let it go. It takes a long time for him to let go of his delusions.</p><p>But for those of us who remember the earlier seasons\u2019 Dany, it is hard to see why Tyrion is suddenly afraid of her (as Sansa notes).</p><p>The problems for Jon have already been detailed.</p><p>My conclusion is that Game of Thrones season 8 at its core, retcons Dany\u2019s entire character and it has terrible consequences for other characters, as well as the continuity of the whole narrative. We are asked to believe in this retcon in terms of evidence that is not as convincing as D&amp;D think it will be (e.g. calling Sansa the most clever, making her intentions good, and having her be hostile towards Dany). All of this was done in service of this Mad Queen arc. It is why I think that season 8 should basically be seen as some sort of miniseries. Within its own parameters it does make sense. The Dany from 8x01 can easily be seen to develop into the Dany of 8x06, if we ignore the past seven seasons and interpret her as what we see in this season alone. But if you do that, what you come up with is not the Dany we know from s1-7, but the retconned Dany I described above. And no wonder they needed Jon and Dany to already be in love for this story to work as it is hard to see why this Dany would fall in love with Jon, or why Jon would fall in love with this Dany.</p>",

            "comment": "<p>I think this needs to be said. Because while the season was going on we didn\u2019t have the ability to see the bigger picture of what was being done in this season. The natural tendency was to interpret Dany\u2019s actions in the episodes as they happened in light of the character as we knew her from s1-s7. And this was especially true for the more dedicated fandom (which is online) where we remember just about every action and incident and tend to have a very fleshed out interpretation of the character. What D&amp;D did was retcon what the character was. Those of us who had spent years analyzing a beloved character were resistant to this and tried to keep interpreting her actions in light of the fairly detailed picture we already had from earlier seasons (and for some of us from the books much before that). As a consequence of this, they changed what Jonerys was as well (how could they not when they have radically altered the character of one of the two main players?). This sends ripples all through the story telling and causes every character\u2019s actions to become difficult to understand. It makes all of them look bad because D&amp;D expected us to suddenly buy this new picture of Dany. We couldn\u2019t see this in episodes 1-3 because episode 3 had hardly any interaction between people, episode 2 had Jon avoiding Dany, and Episode 1 had Jonerys love scenes and we had no idea what was coming so we didn\u2019t interpret things as D&amp;D wanted but rather in continuity with what we knew of Dany (and Jon). But with all of it over, it is now clear what D&amp;D tried to turn Dany into in season 8. Here is what we were asked to swallow:</p><ul><li><b><i>Dany\u2019s exclusive motivation forever has been the Iron Throne. Until she fell in love with Jon</i></b>. Any other motivations (compassion, freeing slaves etc.) or actions are purely in the viewers head and a misinterpretation. What she told Sansa in 8x02 was not a diplomatic decision to leave certain things out (and what diplomatic purpose would be served by leaving her good motivations out anyhow?), but the actual truth about what she thought.</li><li><i><b>Dany is in the North to fight the War against the Dead, not because she has come to believe in the greater importance of Jon\u2019s cause, or any noble motivation</b></i>. In fact that has nothing to do with it (contra what we saw in 7x06). No, <b><i>she is here only out of love of Jon</i></b>.</li><li><b><i>Dany still compelled Jon\u00a0 and demanded he bend the knee as a condition of her help</i></b> (contra 7x06). Hence Jon\u2019s statement in 8x01 that he had to either keep his Crown or save the North was not meant to throw Dany under the bus (as we complained after 8x01) but rather a retcon of what we saw in season 7.</li><li><i><b>Dany is essentially an unfeeling psychopath with respect to all people other than the few she actually cares for and has deep attachments to (e.g. Jorah, Missandei, and most prominently, Jon)</b></i>. The statement by the Samwell Tarly actor after 8x01 was correct in this as far as what the show was actually trying to show us in that scene between Dany and Sam. We didn\u2019t see it that way back then because, once again, that makes no sense with the woman we have come to know in prior seasons. As a result the only things that can be used to motivate her not to act in the worst and most evil ways possible are either pragmatic arguments about how she may be perceived (because she does not want to <i>appear </i>like a psychopath) or the concern that a particular action may make her fall in the eyes of the very few people she actually does care for. Nothing else. No deeper or evolved sense of morality. Retconned out.</li><li><i><b>Dany\u2019s motivations for the throne are purely selfish</b></i>. She is not doing it (even in part) out of any sense of duty to the restoration and continuation of House Targaryen (as, for example, can be argued for others who want to restore the feudal position of their Houses). The fact that she has additional family does not make her happy in the least. There is no conflict in heart whatsoever on the issue. It is just a problem for her pure and simple. The fact that she may have a way to continue the Targaryen dynasty after her (a deep concern for book Dany and even show Dany in 7x07) does not even register. These concerns are gone. Retconned out.</li><li><i><b>Any and every (apparent) act of benevolence or kindness from her is actually nothing more than a manipulative act meant to get her closer to the throne</b></i> (or to tie the few people she loves more closely to her). That is why Sansa\u2019s looks when she legitimizes Gendry are so nasty.</li><li><i><b>Dany is too unwilling to take the opinion of anyone else and will force her own views on anything, even on Jon if they were married</b></i>. She is never going to allow an equal partner in any sense. Forget that she almost accepted every piece of advice he gave her in season 7 when they weren\u2019t even as close as they should be now. Somehow being much more in love will make her less likely to listen to him. Because she has been retconned again.</li><li><b><i>Even her character development about recognizing the Mad King\u2019s evils is reversed</i></b>. Sansa can forgive Jaime\u2019s recent transgressions against her family despite Jaime telling her to her face that he\u2019d do it again coz it was war. But Dany wants to avenge the mad King. No recognition that he was an evil man as she said to Jon in 7x03. And finally</li><li><b><i>Dany actually suffers, at least to some degree, from the old Targaryen madness too,</i></b> and it starts manifesting when she is angry, or unhappy etc.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Now under this re-imagining of Dany\u2019s character, look at what ends up happening to Jonerys as well as Jon:\n\n<br></p><ul><li><i><b>Jon has basically fallen in love with a woman who is little better (and possibly worse) than Cersei</b></i>. He has also become her advocate and started claiming that she will be a\u00a0\u201cgood Queen\u201d because he actually is, as Maisie Williams said\u00a0\u201cfollowing his dick.\u201d Since Northern independence has been raised to the status of something that is objectively good and beyond any argument, Jon has basically followed his dick in giving it up (since there are actually hardly any redeeming qualities to the woman he has fallen in love with).</li><li><i><b>Jonerys is not a love story between a just woman and an honorable man</b></i>. That was a mistake. Davos was wrong. So were Varys and Tyrion. They were misled by Dany\u2019s charisma and blinded to her true nature (i.e. the retconned nature, not what we have seen in preceding seasons). It is basically a love story between a stupid man (who tries to be honorable) and a woman who tries to project the image of being just for purely manipulative and selfish reasons.\u00a0</li><li><i><b>Dany\u2019s love for Jon is basically intended as some type of abusive and selfish relationship in the end where he will essentially be her \u2018mistress\u2019 since she never even considers mentioning marriage</b></i>. Forget that she felt that even asking Daario to become this would be unfair in 6x10. No, rather we are to accept that it will be just her forcing him to do whatever she wants in every case, and running roughshod over him, ignoring his views and desires whenever they don\u2019t conform with hers and so on. She<i> actually</i> means to threaten Sansa\u2019s life when she says that dragons eat whatever they want. Or tells Jon that if Sansa can\u2019t respect her\u2026 etc. But Jon is so stupidly in love with this woman that he still doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with what she says. Jon\u2019s blindness continues straight into the early parts of 8x06 where he still keeps trying to justify her actions even when seeing clear evidence of her evil in front of his eyes. Of course the audience did not really see it this way either (unless they were already antis) because the Dany we knew would not intend these statements as threats to a member of Jon\u2019s family. So we chose more benign interpretations that made better sense with the Dany we knew from seasons 1-7. However, I don\u2019t think that was what D&amp;D intended for us to see here.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Now, since they cannot show us these things in the short time they have and it is impossible to match what they have shown us in seasons 1-7, the solution is to have people make statements and interpretations for the audience in the hopes that the audience will agree with this. The problem often is that the audience has a hard time buying the negative views of these other characters about Dany as correct because many of us have come to view her far more positively than them!</p><p><b>Take the case of Sansa</b>.\u00a0</p><p><i>Here is what I think D&amp;D wanted us to think</i>: Sansa\u2019s hostile reception towards Dany in 8x01 is completely justified. Dany is in fact a tyrant who likes instilling fear in people (as shown by her smile when Drogon scares people). Sansa is completely right about not trusting Dany\u00a0 and thinking that there is something very wrong and sinister about her and that Jon is just a fool blinded by love for a beautiful woman who cannot see her dark side. Dany\u2019s unwillingness to entertain Sansa\u2019s demand for Northern independence is something sinister about Dany and also shows that all her friendliness towards Sansa is purely false politeness. Sansa is supposed to be the super clever Stark who can see through people while Jon cannot (again we have no evidence for this since we still remember season 7 where only a last minute information dump from Bran was able to save her from getting outplayed by Baelish again). Instead we are now supposed to accept this because Arya (who has met the likes of Tywin Lannister, Jaqen H\u2019ghar, and Littlefinger) says that Sansa is the most clever person she\u2019s ever met. At the same time Sansa is suddenly turned into someone whose motivations are completely pure and above objection. She is not selfish in any sense.

This is highlighted when Arya tells Jon not to \u201cforget\u201d that they are his family. Sansa\u2019s concerns are above suspicion. Jon\u2019s motivations are not since he is following his dick. That is what D&amp;D mean for us to see.</p><p>But the thing is, we didn\u2019t see that because we have s1-7 in our memory. We are not convinced that Sansa actually is this super clever person. Instead Arya\u2019s statement about her looks nonsensical to us. We are not convinced that Sansa\u2019s motivations are completely pure. We remember her undermining Jon and wanting to take over the North herself in his absence. We also don\u2019t see Daenerys as this retconned version (i.e. the one I detailed above) in these early episodes that D&amp;D had in mind. The consequence is that Sansa\u2019s actions look extremely stupid and petty to us. She is concerned about Dany, who we consider a heroic character, who is here to help them because of a greater threat (because that was season 7 Dany) when the AotD is coming. Because we haven\u2019t accepted this view of Dany. Instead of accepting that Sansa has a better understanding of Dany, we think she is wrong because we have been familiar with the character for seven seasons. D&amp;D wanted us to think in the other direction. We were supposed to take Sansa\u2019s concerns (expressed to Tyrion in the crypts) about Dany as legitimate and Missandei\u2019s reaction as something that a fanatical follower of Dany might say to them (unlike Tyrion who is supposed to be more rational than a true believer like Missandei). Instead many of us agreed with Missandei.</p><p>Sansa is just one example. Other characters also look bad because of the retcon. Tyrion looks like a complete fool for having bought into the Dany the Savior narrative when he should have known better. His cleverness is nullified. We essentially have Sansa tell him as much (although with respect to Cersei). He seems even more foolish for continuing to expect good things to come from her because he has put his faith in a false savior and cannot let it go. It takes a long time for him to let go of his delusions.</p><p>But for those of us who remember the earlier seasons\u2019 Dany, it is hard to see why Tyrion is suddenly afraid of her (as Sansa notes).</p><p>The problems for Jon have already been detailed.</p><p>My conclusion is that Game of Thrones season 8 at its core, retcons Dany\u2019s entire character and it has terrible consequences for other characters, as well as the continuity of the whole narrative. We are asked to believe in this retcon in terms of evidence that is not as convincing as D&amp;D think it will be (e.g. calling Sansa the most clever, making her intentions good, and having her be hostile towards Dany). All of this was done in service of this Mad Queen arc. It is why I think that season 8 should basically be seen as some sort of miniseries. Within its own parameters it does make sense. The Dany from 8x01 can easily be seen to develop into the Dany of 8x06, if we ignore the past seven seasons and interpret her as what we see in this season alone. But if you do that, what you come up with is not the Dany we know from s1-7, but the retconned Dany I described above. And no wonder they needed Jon and Dany to already be in love for this story to work as it is hard to see why this Dany would fall in love with Jon, or why Jon would fall in love with this Dany.</p>",
                "content": "<p>I think this needs to be said. Because while the season was going on we didn&rsquo;t have the ability to see the bigger picture of what was being done in this season. The natural tendency was to interpret Dany&rsquo;s actions in the episodes as they happened in light of the character as we knew her from s1-s7. And this was especially true for the more dedicated fandom (which is online) where we remember just about every action and incident and tend to have a very fleshed out interpretation of the character. What D&amp;D did was retcon what the character was. Those of us who had spent years analyzing a beloved character were resistant to this and tried to keep interpreting her actions in light of the fairly detailed picture we already had from earlier seasons (and for some of us from the books much before that). As a consequence of this, they changed what Jonerys was as well (how could they not when they have radically altered the character of one of the two main players?). This sends ripples all through the story telling and causes every character&rsquo;s actions to become difficult to understand. It makes all of them look bad because D&amp;D expected us to suddenly buy this new picture of Dany. We couldn&rsquo;t see this in episodes 1-3 because episode 3 had hardly any interaction between people, episode 2 had Jon avoiding Dany, and Episode 1 had Jonerys love scenes and we had no idea what was coming so we didn&rsquo;t interpret things as D&amp;D wanted but rather in continuity with what we knew of Dany (and Jon). But with all of it over, it is now clear what D&amp;D tried to turn Dany into in season 8. Here is what we were asked to swallow:</p><ul><li><b><i>Dany&rsquo;s exclusive motivation forever has been the Iron Throne. Until she fell in love with Jon</i></b>. Any other motivations (compassion, freeing slaves etc.) or actions are purely in the viewers head and a misinterpretation. What she told Sansa in 8x02 was not a diplomatic decision to leave certain things out (and what diplomatic purpose would be served by leaving her good motivations out anyhow?), but the actual truth about what she thought.</li><li><i><b>Dany is in the North to fight the War against the Dead, not because she has come to believe in the greater importance of Jon&rsquo;s cause, or any noble motivation</b></i>. In fact that has nothing to do with it (contra what we saw in 7x06). No, <b><i>she is here only out of love of Jon</i></b>.</li><li><b><i>Dany still compelled Jon&nbsp; and demanded he bend the knee as a condition of her help</i></b> (contra 7x06). Hence Jon&rsquo;s statement in 8x01 that he had to either keep his Crown or save the North was not meant to throw Dany under the bus (as we complained after 8x01) but rather a retcon of what we saw in season 7.</li><li><i><b>Dany is essentially an unfeeling psychopath with respect to all people other than the few she actually cares for and has deep attachments to (e.g. Jorah, Missandei, and most prominently, Jon)</b></i>. The statement by the Samwell Tarly actor after 8x01 was correct in this as far as what the show was actually trying to show us in that scene between Dany and Sam. We didn&rsquo;t see it that way back then because, once again, that makes no sense with the woman we have come to know in prior seasons. As a result the only things that can be used to motivate her not to act in the worst and most evil ways possible are either pragmatic arguments about how she may be perceived (because she does not want to <i>appear </i>like a psychopath) or the concern that a particular action may make her fall in the eyes of the very few people she actually does care for. Nothing else. No deeper or evolved sense of morality. Retconned out.</li><li><i><b>Dany&rsquo;s motivations for the throne are purely selfish</b></i>. She is not doing it (even in part) out of any sense of duty to the restoration and continuation of House Targaryen (as, for example, can be argued for others who want to restore the feudal position of their Houses). The fact that she has additional family does not make her happy in the least. There is no conflict in heart whatsoever on the issue. It is just a problem for her pure and simple. The fact that she may have a way to continue the Targaryen dynasty after her (a deep concern for book Dany and even show Dany in 7x07) does not even register. These concerns are gone. Retconned out.</li><li><i><b>Any and every (apparent) act of benevolence or kindness from her is actually nothing more than a manipulative act meant to get her closer to the throne</b></i> (or to tie the few people she loves more closely to her). That is why Sansa&rsquo;s looks when she legitimizes Gendry are so nasty.</li><li><i><b>Dany is too unwilling to take the opinion of anyone else and will force her own views on anything, even on Jon if they were married</b></i>. She is never going to allow an equal partner in any sense. Forget that she almost accepted every piece of advice he gave her in season 7 when they weren&rsquo;t even as close as they should be now. Somehow being much more in love will make her less likely to listen to him. Because she has been retconned again.</li><li><b><i>Even her character development about recognizing the Mad King&rsquo;s evils is reversed</i></b>. Sansa can forgive Jaime&rsquo;s recent transgressions against her family despite Jaime telling her to her face that he&rsquo;d do it again coz it was war. But Dany wants to avenge the mad King. No recognition that he was an evil man as she said to Jon in 7x03. And finally</li><li><b><i>Dany actually suffers, at least to some degree, from the old Targaryen madness too,</i></b> and it starts manifesting when she is angry, or unhappy etc.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now under this re-imagining of Dany&rsquo;s character, look at what ends up happening to Jonerys as well as Jon:\n\n<br /></p><ul><li><i><b>Jon has basically fallen in love with a woman who is little better (and possibly worse) than Cersei</b></i>. He has also become her advocate and started claiming that she will be a&nbsp;&ldquo;good Queen&rdquo; because he actually is, as Maisie Williams said&nbsp;&ldquo;following his dick.&rdquo; Since Northern independence has been raised to the status of something that is objectively good and beyond any argument, Jon has basically followed his dick in giving it up (since there are actually hardly any redeeming qualities to the woman he has fallen in love with).</li><li><i><b>Jonerys is not a love story between a just woman and an honorable man</b></i>. That was a mistake. Davos was wrong. So were Varys and Tyrion. They were misled by Dany&rsquo;s charisma and blinded to her true nature (i.e. the retconned nature, not what we have seen in preceding seasons). It is basically a love story between a stupid man (who tries to be honorable) and a woman who tries to project the image of being just for purely manipulative and selfish reasons.&nbsp;</li><li><i><b>Dany&rsquo;s love for Jon is basically intended as some type of abusive and selfish relationship in the end where he will essentially be her &lsquo;mistress&rsquo; since she never even considers mentioning marriage</b></i>. Forget that she felt that even asking Daario to become this would be unfair in 6x10. No, rather we are to accept that it will be just her forcing him to do whatever she wants in every case, and running roughshod over him, ignoring his views and desires whenever they don&rsquo;t conform with hers and so on. She<i> actually</i> means to threaten Sansa&rsquo;s life when she says that dragons eat whatever they want. Or tells Jon that if Sansa can&rsquo;t respect her&hellip; etc. But Jon is so stupidly in love with this woman that he still doesn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with what she says. Jon&rsquo;s blindness continues straight into the early parts of 8x06 where he still keeps trying to justify her actions even when seeing clear evidence of her evil in front of his eyes. Of course the audience did not really see it this way either (unless they were already antis) because the Dany we knew would not intend these statements as threats to a member of Jon&rsquo;s family. So we chose more benign interpretations that made better sense with the Dany we knew from seasons 1-7. However, I don&rsquo;t think that was what D&amp;D intended for us to see here.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now, since they cannot show us these things in the short time they have and it is impossible to match what they have shown us in seasons 1-7, the solution is to have people make statements and interpretations for the audience in the hopes that the audience will agree with this. The problem often is that the audience has a hard time buying the negative views of these other characters about Dany as correct because many of us have come to view her far more positively than them!</p><p><b>Take the case of Sansa</b>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Here is what I think D&amp;D wanted us to think</i>: Sansa&rsquo;s hostile reception towards Dany in 8x01 is completely justified. Dany is in fact a tyrant who likes instilling fear in people (as shown by her smile when Drogon scares people). Sansa is completely right about not trusting Dany&nbsp; and thinking that there is something very wrong and sinister about her and that Jon is just a fool blinded by love for a beautiful woman who cannot see her dark side. Dany&rsquo;s unwillingness to entertain Sansa&rsquo;s demand for Northern independence is something sinister about Dany and also shows that all her friendliness towards Sansa is purely false politeness. Sansa is supposed to be the super clever Stark who can see through people while Jon cannot (again we have no evidence for this since we still remember season 7 where only a last minute information dump from Bran was able to save her from getting outplayed by Baelish again). Instead we are now supposed to accept this because Arya (who has met the likes of Tywin Lannister, Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar, and Littlefinger) says that Sansa is the most clever person she&rsquo;s ever met. At the same time Sansa is suddenly turned into someone whose motivations are completely pure and above objection. She is not selfish in any sense. This is highlighted when Arya tells Jon not to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; that they are his family. Sansa&rsquo;s concerns are above suspicion.

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",
