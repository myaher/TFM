La recente esplosione di violenza incitata tramite social media globali come Facebook e Twitter mostrano che era una visione previdente.</p><p>Quindi ci sono gli effetti economici di una cultura globalizzata. Gi\u00e0 prima della popolarit\u00e0 dei social media e delle compagnie dette Big Tech (<i>N/B: societ\u00e0 basate sullo sviluppo di tecnologie</i>), meno di una dozzina di compagnie - come \u201cDisney\u201d, \u201c21st Century Fox\u201d, \u201cSony\u201d e \u201cViacom\u201d - possedevano la fetta maggiore dei media e delle istituzioni pi\u00f9 importanti al mondo.</p><p>L'arrivo di grandi piattaforme tecnologiche ha solo accelerato i trend verso una concentrazione maggiore del mercato e i rischi di perdita della diversit\u00e0 culturale.</p><p>Infine, per quanto ci possano piacere il nostro panino con patate fritte, la nostra busta di patatine e il nostro bicchiere di caff\u00e8 da portar via, anche la cultura globalizzata dei fast-food ha aggravato i problemi mondiali.</p><p>Se tutti consumassero la stessa quantit\u00e0 di hamburger degli americani o creassero la stessa spazzatura, il cambiamento climatico e l'inquinamento sarebbero insormontabili e l'obesit\u00e0 causerebbe anche pi\u00f9 malattie e morti.</p><p><b>Bomba a orologio o manna dal cielo?</b></p><p>Questo porta ad alcune importanti domande. La globalizzazione della cultura guidata dall'America \u00e8 una bomba ad orologio autodistruttiva destinata ad uccidere lentamente le lingue, le culture e la vita stessa? \u00c8 un fenomeno che arricchisce le culture locali con un diverso set di influenze straniere? O dovremmo essere agnostici a riguardo, purch\u00e9 porti ad un risultato migliore per la societ\u00e0 e l'ambiente, come un governo migliore o una gestione del clima?\u00a0</p><p>Se a fino poco fa la prima domanda sembrava probabilmente risposta da un \u201cs\u00ec\u201d, i BTS, Fonsi e i loro compagni hanno dimostrato che una globalizzazione pi\u00f9 diversificata non pu\u00f2 essere completamente esclusa.</p><p>Consideriamo per primo il caso di Luis Fonsi. Con la sua hit \u201cDespacito\u201d, il cantante portoricano ha infranto sette record \u201cGuinness\u201d, tra cui il primo video di YouTube a raggiungere 5 miliardi di visualizzazioni e la traccia pi\u00f9 ascoltata nel mondo. Con questo ha dimostrato che si pu\u00f2 influenzare la cultura globale anche attraverso la lingua spagnola e la cultura caraibica. Ci\u00f2 non sorprende se si considera che ci sono 437 milioni di persone che parlano lo spagnolo come prima lingua, a confronto dei 372 milioni di nativi anglofoni.\u00a0</p><p>Il caso dei BTS \u00e8 forse anche pi\u00f9 impressionante, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 anche pi\u00f9 avverso ad ogni probabilit\u00e0 culturale. Mentre lo spagnolo, assieme al cinese mandarino e all'inglese, appartiene alla top 3 delle lingue pi\u00f9 parlate nel mondo, il coreano non compare neanche nella top 10. Infatti, la Corea fino ad un secolo fa era conosciuta come il \u201cRegno Eremita\u201d per il suo isolamento culturale ed economico.\u00a0</p><p>Di questo isolamento ci sono tracce ancora oggi. Nelle economie di altri Paesi del G20, come in quella della Francia o della Germania, la maggior parte dei successi musicali del 2017 sono state canzoni in lingua inglese, mentre in Corea comunque nella lingua nazionale e i BTS non sono un\u2019eccezione, essendo i loro brani cantati in coreano con solo alcune parti del testo in inglese. Eppure il gruppo \u00e8 diventato comunque il fenomeno musicale globale dell\u2019anno. </p><p>A questo si aggiunge il fatto che il successo del gruppo sia in parte dovuto anche a spinte dal basso verso l\u2019alto, nel senso che sono stati i fan a darvi un enorme contributo traducendo e sottotitolando i video e le esibizioni in inglese. I BTS non sono, inoltre, i primi artisti K-pop ad aver ottenuto \u00a0successo a livello internazionale: in Occidente, ad esempio, PSY \u00e8 molto conosciuto, cos\u00ec come lo sono altri gruppi coreani in diversi Paesi dell\u2019Asia, dalla Cina al Vietnam, per arrivare al Giappone. </p><p>Ovviamente, come una rondine non fa primavera, per cos\u00ec dire, cos\u00ec non saranno Fonsi e i BTS da soli a cambiare la globalizzazione culturale, ma anche in altri settori nuovi protagonisti culturali sono emersi da realt\u00e0 diverse da quella americana e l\u2019Asia, in particolare, sta giocando un ruolo fondamentale. </p><p>La prima Intelligenza Artificiale a condurre un telegiornale viene dalla Cina e parla sia il mandarino che l\u2019inglese, mentre sempre di pi\u00f9 Hollywood subisce l\u2019influenza delle \u00a0compagnie cinesi e degli attori asiatici con i quali lavora, e degli esempi sono \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d con Matt Damon e Jing Tian, oppure uno dei successi cinematografici \u00a0del 2018, \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d, film con un cast completamente asiatico e basato su una serie di libri parimenti di successo. </p><p>Nel settore tecnologico, una delle pi\u00f9 famose compagnie di streaming, \u201cSpotify\u201d, \u00e8 svedese, mentre in quello sportivo, sia i Mondiali di calcio FIFA che i Giochi Olimpici possono vantare di aver celebrato nazioni e culture diverse, pur dovendo affrontare delle critiche per la cattiva gestione della governance. </p><p>Tuttavia per quanto i campioni dell\u2019americanizzazione della cultura globale possano essere oggetto di biasimo, alcune delle compagnie pi\u00f9 rappresentative in questo senso hanno condotto il mondo verso un positivo cambiamento culturale. </p><p><b>Il quadro generale</b></p><p>\n\nSaadia Zahidi del World Economic Forum, nel suo libro \u201c50 Million Rising\u201d, ha scritto che \u201cMcDonald\u2019s\u201d \u00e8 stata una tra le prime compagnie ad aver integrato nella forza lavoro le donne in Paesi a maggioranza musulmana come l\u2019Indonesia e l\u2019Arabia Saudita, mentre \u201cPepsiCo\u201d, sotto la guida del CEO (<i>N/B: \u201cdirettore d\u2019azienda\u201d</i>) di origine indiana Indra Nooyi, ha iniziato ad allontanarsi dalla produzione di bevande zuccherate per investire in attivit\u00e0 come \u201cSodastream\u201d che commercializza l\u2019acqua di rubinetto ed evita la plastica. <br/><br/>Ma questi sono elementi che potrebbero risultare mancanti al quadro culturale \u00a0generale del 2018. Il fatto che siano cantanti e gruppi dai Caraibi o dalla Corea a creare i successi musicali pi\u00f9 popolari del mondo dimostra che, dopo tutto, non c\u2019\u00e8 nulla di inevitabile nel processo di americanizzazione della globalizzazione culturale. <br/><br/>Le culture diverse, quasi sicuramente, continueranno ad esistere e ad incrociarsi influenzandosi vicendevolmente come hanno fatto per secoli fino ad ora, ma quello che \u00e8 davvero essenziale \u00e8 che ognuno abbracci la propria cultura e che i politici e le altre parti interessate rafforzino e promuovano i legami culturali nella societ\u00e0. Ma se i membri di un gruppo musicale del \u201cRegno Eremita\u201d possono essere eletti come \u201cPersonalit\u00e0 dell\u2019anno\u201d nella capitale economica del mondo, una monocultura globale non \u00e8 poi cos\u00ec vicina, in fondo.\u201d<br/></p><p><b><i>Traduzione a cura di Bangtan Italian Channel Subs (\u00a9Cam, Clara, jimindipityR) | \u00a9weforum</i></b></p>",

O dovremmo essere agnostici a riguardo, purch\u00e9 porti ad un risultato migliore per la societ\u00e0 e l'ambiente, come un governo migliore o una gestione del clima?\u00a0</p><p>Se a fino poco fa la prima domanda sembrava probabilmente risposta da un \u201cs\u00ec\u201d, i BTS, Fonsi e i loro compagni hanno dimostrato che una globalizzazione pi\u00f9 diversificata non pu\u00f2 essere completamente esclusa.</p><p>Consideriamo per primo il caso di Luis Fonsi. Con la sua hit \u201cDespacito\u201d, il cantante portoricano ha infranto sette record \u201cGuinness\u201d, tra cui il primo video di YouTube a raggiungere 5 miliardi di visualizzazioni e la traccia pi\u00f9 ascoltata nel mondo. Con questo ha dimostrato che si pu\u00f2 influenzare la cultura globale anche attraverso la lingua spagnola e la cultura caraibica. Ci\u00f2 non sorprende se si considera che ci sono 437 milioni di persone che parlano lo spagnolo come prima lingua, a confronto dei 372 milioni di nativi anglofoni.\u00a0</p><p>Il caso dei BTS \u00e8 forse anche pi\u00f9 impressionante, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 anche pi\u00f9 avverso ad ogni probabilit\u00e0 culturale. Mentre lo spagnolo, assieme al cinese mandarino e all'inglese, appartiene alla top 3 delle lingue pi\u00f9 parlate nel mondo, il coreano non compare neanche nella top 10. Infatti, la Corea fino ad un secolo fa era conosciuta come il \u201cRegno Eremita\u201d per il suo isolamento culturale ed economico.\u00a0</p><p>Di questo isolamento ci sono tracce ancora oggi. Nelle economie di altri Paesi del G20, come in quella della Francia o della Germania, la maggior parte dei successi musicali del 2017 sono state canzoni in lingua inglese, mentre in Corea comunque nella lingua nazionale e i BTS non sono un\u2019eccezione, essendo i loro brani cantati in coreano con solo alcune parti del testo in inglese. Eppure il gruppo \u00e8 diventato comunque il fenomeno musicale globale dell\u2019anno. </p><p>A questo si aggiunge il fatto che il successo del gruppo sia in parte dovuto anche a spinte dal basso verso l\u2019alto, nel senso che sono stati i fan a darvi un enorme contributo traducendo e sottotitolando i video e le esibizioni in inglese. I BTS non sono, inoltre, i primi artisti K-pop ad aver ottenuto \u00a0successo a livello internazionale: in Occidente, ad esempio, PSY \u00e8 molto conosciuto, cos\u00ec come lo sono altri gruppi coreani in diversi Paesi dell\u2019Asia, dalla Cina al Vietnam, per arrivare al Giappone. </p><p>Ovviamente, come una rondine non fa primavera, per cos\u00ec dire, cos\u00ec non saranno Fonsi e i BTS da soli a cambiare la globalizzazione culturale, ma anche in altri settori nuovi protagonisti culturali sono emersi da realt\u00e0 diverse da quella americana e l\u2019Asia, in particolare, sta giocando un ruolo fondamentale. </p><p>La prima Intelligenza Artificiale a condurre un telegiornale viene dalla Cina e parla sia il mandarino che l\u2019inglese, mentre sempre di pi\u00f9 Hollywood subisce l\u2019influenza delle \u00a0compagnie cinesi e degli attori asiatici con i quali lavora, e degli esempi sono \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d con Matt Damon e Jing Tian, oppure uno dei successi cinematografici \u00a0del 2018, \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d, film con un cast completamente asiatico e basato su una serie di libri parimenti di successo. </p><p>Nel settore tecnologico, una delle pi\u00f9 famose compagnie di streaming, \u201cSpotify\u201d, \u00e8 svedese, mentre in quello sportivo, sia i Mondiali di calcio FIFA che i Giochi Olimpici possono vantare di aver celebrato nazioni e culture diverse, pur dovendo affrontare delle critiche per la cattiva gestione della governance. </p><p>Tuttavia per quanto i campioni dell\u2019americanizzazione della cultura globale possano essere oggetto di biasimo, alcune delle compagnie pi\u00f9 rappresentative in questo senso hanno condotto il mondo verso un positivo cambiamento culturale. </p><p><b>Il quadro generale</b></p><p>\n\nSaadia Zahidi del World Economic Forum, nel suo libro \u201c50 Million Rising\u201d, ha scritto che \u201cMcDonald\u2019s\u201d \u00e8 stata una tra le prime compagnie ad aver integrato nella forza lavoro le donne in Paesi a maggioranza musulmana come l\u2019Indonesia e l\u2019Arabia Saudita, mentre \u201cPepsiCo\u201d, sotto la guida del CEO (<i>N/B: \u201cdirettore d\u2019azienda\u201d</i>) di origine indiana Indra Nooyi, ha iniziato ad allontanarsi dalla produzione di bevande zuccherate per investire in attivit\u00e0 come \u201cSodastream\u201d che commercializza l\u2019acqua di rubinetto ed evita la plastica. <br><br>Ma questi sono elementi che potrebbero risultare mancanti al quadro culturale \u00a0generale del 2018. Il fatto che siano cantanti e gruppi dai Caraibi o dalla Corea a creare i successi musicali pi\u00f9 popolari del mondo dimostra che, dopo tutto, non c\u2019\u00e8 nulla di inevitabile nel processo di americanizzazione della globalizzazione culturale. <br><br>Le culture diverse, quasi sicuramente, continueranno ad esistere e ad incrociarsi influenzandosi vicendevolmente come hanno fatto per secoli fino ad ora, ma quello che \u00e8 davvero essenziale \u00e8 che ognuno abbracci la propria cultura e che i politici e le altre parti interessate rafforzino e promuovano i legami culturali nella societ\u00e0. Ma se i membri di un gruppo musicale del \u201cRegno Eremita\u201d possono essere eletti come \u201cPersonalit\u00e0 dell\u2019anno\u201d nella capitale economica del mondo, una monocultura globale non \u00e8 poi cos\u00ec vicina, in fondo.\u201d<br></p><p><b><i>Traduzione a cura di Bangtan Italian Channel Subs (\u00a9Cam, Clara, jimindipityR) | \u00a9weforum</i></b></p></p>",

Al termine di un sondaggio condotto a livello globale, i BTS hanno continuato a mantenere il loro vantaggio iniziale vincendo contro candidati come il pianeta Terra e il presidente americano Donald Trump.</p><p>Ma chi sono I BTS? A meno che quest\u2019anno non abbiate vissuto da eremiti (come me), non farete questa domanda. Il fenomeno K-pop ha rilasciato due album che si sono posizionati al primo posto della classifica Billboard Top 200 e ha battuto Justin Bieber diventando il Top Social Artist del 2018. Inoltre, i BTS sono gli artisti di cui si parla di pi\u00f9 al mondo.</p><p>Dando uno sguardo al loro successo globale, tuttavia, ci permette di identificare una peculiarit\u00e0. Le loro canzoni sono prevalentemente cantate in coreano, non in inglese. Non sono i soli in questo. Artisti latino-americani come Fonsi (autore di Despacito) e Enrique Iglesias, o altri artisti coreani come PSY (autore del Gangnam Style) dimostrano che la globalizzazione della cultura non coincide ormai pi\u00f9 con l\u2019americanizzazione. Da questo momento dunque la globalizzazione sar\u00e0 sempre pi\u00f9 diversificata?</p><p>A partire dalla fine della Seconda Guerra Mondiale fino agli anni 2000, la direzione imboccata dalla globalizzazione culturale era solo una: quella della lingua inglese e della cultura Americana.</p><p>Mentre molti Paesi europei fino agli anni \u201960 erano ancora parecchio influenzati dalla cultura francese, il trend \u00e8 iniziato a cambiare a partire dal 1945. I soldati americani erano giunti in Europa per combattere, ma avevano anche portato la Coca Cola, la musica jazz e l\u2019ossessione per i film di Hollywood. Anche in altri continenti l\u2019emergente potenza economica e politica dell\u2019America stava sempre pi\u00f9 influenzando la cultura.</p><p>Davvero dunque, mentre molte societ\u00e0 asiatiche ed europee erano focalizzate sul riorganizzarsi, la cultura americana ha conquistato il mondo. Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin e James Brown hanno dato il via al trend. Col passare dei decenni, solo Brits e altri artisti di lingua inglese come i Beatles e i Rolling Stones sono veramente riusciti a stare al passo con i colleghi americani.</p><p>Ad oggi non si pu\u00f2 negare che la cultura dominante a livello globale sia quella Americana. I film che hanno registrato il ricavo pi\u00f9 alto di sempre sono praticamente solo quelli di Hollywood (basti pensare ad Avatar, Titanic o Star Wars). Gli album pi\u00f9 venduti di tutti i tempi sono per la maggior parte americani (anche se la band australiana degli AC/DC e la band britannica dei Pink Floyd hanno dato del filo da torcere a Michael Jackson).</p><p>La maggior parte dei social media e delle aziende internet sono americani. E la cultura del cibo, anche se molto varia, \u00e8 ancora influenzata dal McDonalds, dalla Coca Cola, da Starbucks e dalla Pepsi Cola.</p><p>Questo sviluppo non sarebbe stato possibile senza una maggiore globalizzazione dell\u2019economia mondiale e dell\u2019impatto trasformativo della tecnologia. Negli anni \u201960, i voli transatlantici e le registrazioni in radio hanno reso possibile ai Beatles di far nascere una vera e propria mania in America. Negli anni \u201990 e 2000, mercati aperti a tutto il mondo e internet hanno permesso a un fenomeno culturale di espandersi anche pi\u00f9 velocemente.\n\n<br></p><p>\n\nIl New York Times ha riportato che per il 2007 met\u00e0 delle rimanenti 7000 lingue erano in pericolo di estinzione. Per il 2017, il World Economic Forum ha scritto che pi\u00f9 di 1500 tra queste avevano meno di 1000 persone capaci di parlarle.</p><p>Come l\u2019UNESCO, braccio educativo, scientifico e culturale delle Nazioni Unite, ha fatto notare al Rio+20 (<i>N/B: conferenza sullo sviluppo sostenibile tenutasi nel 2012 a Rio de Janeiro</i>), l'omogeneit\u00e0 della cultura ha portato anche altri rischi.</p><p>Nel 2012 ha detto: \u201cSeppur questo fenomeno promuova l'integrazione delle societ\u00e0, pu\u00f2 anche portare ad una perdita dell\u2019originalit\u00e0 della cultura locale, che in cambio potrebbe condurre alla perdita di identit\u00e0, ad esclusioni ed anche a conflitti\u201d. La recente esplosione di violenza incitata tramite social media globali come Facebook e Twitter mostrano che era una visione previdente.</p><p>Quindi ci sono gli effetti economici di una cultura globalizzata. Gi\u00e0 prima della popolarit\u00e0 dei social media e delle compagnie dette Big Tech (<i>N/B: societ\u00e0 basate sullo sviluppo di tecnologie</i>), meno di una dozzina di compagnie - come \u201cDisney\u201d, \u201c21st Century Fox\u201d, \u201cSony\u201d e \u201cViacom\u201d - possedevano la fetta maggiore dei media e delle istituzioni pi\u00f9 importanti al mondo.</p><p>L'arrivo di grandi piattaforme tecnologiche ha solo accelerato i trend verso una concentrazione maggiore del mercato e i rischi di perdita della diversit\u00e0 culturale.</p><p>Infine, per quanto ci possano piacere il nostro panino con patate fritte, la nostra busta di patatine e il nostro bicchiere di caff\u00e8 da portar via, anche la cultura globalizzata dei fast-food ha aggravato i problemi mondiali.</p><p>Se tutti consumassero la stessa quantit\u00e0 di hamburger degli americani o creassero la stessa spazzatura, il cambiamento climatico e l'inquinamento sarebbero insormontabili e l'obesit\u00e0 causerebbe anche pi\u00f9 malattie e morti.</p><p><b>Bomba a orologio o manna dal cielo?</b></p><p>Questo porta ad alcune importanti domande.

Per il 2017, il World Economic Forum ha scritto che pi&ugrave; di 1500 tra queste avevano meno di 1000 persone capaci di parlarle.</p><p>Come l&rsquo;UNESCO, braccio educativo, scientifico e culturale delle Nazioni Unite, ha fatto notare al Rio+20 (<i>N/B: conferenza sullo sviluppo sostenibile tenutasi nel 2012 a Rio de Janeiro</i>), l'omogeneit&agrave; della cultura ha portato anche altri rischi.</p><p>Nel 2012 ha detto: &ldquo;Seppur questo fenomeno promuova l'integrazione delle societ&agrave;, pu&ograve; anche portare ad una perdita dell&rsquo;originalit&agrave; della cultura locale, che in cambio potrebbe condurre alla perdita di identit&agrave;, ad esclusioni ed anche a conflitti&rdquo;. La recente esplosione di violenza incitata tramite social media globali come Facebook e Twitter mostrano che era una visione previdente.</p><p>Quindi ci sono gli effetti economici di una cultura globalizzata. Gi&agrave; prima della popolarit&agrave; dei social media e delle compagnie dette Big Tech (<i>N/B: societ&agrave; basate sullo sviluppo di tecnologie</i>), meno di una dozzina di compagnie - come &ldquo;Disney&rdquo;, &ldquo;21st Century Fox&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sony&rdquo; e &ldquo;Viacom&rdquo; - possedevano la fetta maggiore dei media e delle istituzioni pi&ugrave; importanti al mondo.</p><p>L'arrivo di grandi piattaforme tecnologiche ha solo accelerato i trend verso una concentrazione maggiore del mercato e i rischi di perdita della diversit&agrave; culturale.</p><p>Infine, per quanto ci possano piacere il nostro panino con patate fritte, la nostra busta di patatine e il nostro bicchiere di caff&egrave; da portar via, anche la cultura globalizzata dei fast-food ha aggravato i problemi mondiali.</p><p>Se tutti consumassero la stessa quantit&agrave; di hamburger degli americani o creassero la stessa spazzatura, il cambiamento climatico e l'inquinamento sarebbero insormontabili e l'obesit&agrave; causerebbe anche pi&ugrave; malattie e morti.</p><p><b>Bomba a orologio o manna dal cielo?</b></p><p>Questo porta ad alcune importanti domande. La globalizzazione della cultura guidata dall'America &egrave; una bomba ad orologio autodistruttiva destinata ad uccidere lentamente le lingue, le culture e la vita stessa? &Egrave; un fenomeno che arricchisce le culture locali con un diverso set di influenze straniere? O dovremmo essere agnostici a riguardo, purch&eacute; porti ad un risultato migliore per la societ&agrave; e l'ambiente, come un governo migliore o una gestione del clima?&nbsp;</p><p>Se a fino poco fa la prima domanda sembrava probabilmente risposta da un &ldquo;s&igrave;&rdquo;, i BTS, Fonsi e i loro compagni hanno dimostrato che una globalizzazione pi&ugrave; diversificata non pu&ograve; essere completamente esclusa.</p><p>Consideriamo per primo il caso di Luis Fonsi. Con la sua hit &ldquo;Despacito&rdquo;, il cantante portoricano ha infranto sette record &ldquo;Guinness&rdquo;, tra cui il primo video di YouTube a raggiungere 5 miliardi di visualizzazioni e la traccia pi&ugrave; ascoltata nel mondo. Con questo ha dimostrato che si pu&ograve; influenzare la cultura globale anche attraverso la lingua spagnola e la cultura caraibica. Ci&ograve; non sorprende se si considera che ci sono 437 milioni di persone che parlano lo spagnolo come prima lingua, a confronto dei 372 milioni di nativi anglofoni.&nbsp;</p><p>Il caso dei BTS &egrave; forse anche pi&ugrave; impressionante, perch&eacute; &egrave; anche pi&ugrave; avverso ad ogni probabilit&agrave; culturale. Mentre lo spagnolo, assieme al cinese mandarino e all'inglese, appartiene alla top 3 delle lingue pi&ugrave; parlate nel mondo, il coreano non compare neanche nella top 10. Infatti, la Corea fino ad un secolo fa era conosciuta come il &ldquo;Regno Eremita&rdquo; per il suo isolamento culturale ed economico.&nbsp;</p><p>Di questo isolamento ci sono tracce ancora oggi. Nelle economie di altri Paesi del G20, come in quella della Francia o della Germania, la maggior parte dei successi musicali del 2017 sono state canzoni in lingua inglese, mentre in Corea comunque nella lingua nazionale e i BTS non sono un&rsquo;eccezione, essendo i loro brani cantati in coreano con solo alcune parti del testo in inglese. Eppure il gruppo &egrave; diventato comunque il fenomeno musicale globale dell&rsquo;anno. </p><p>A questo si aggiunge il fatto che il successo del gruppo sia in parte dovuto anche a spinte dal basso verso l&rsquo;alto, nel senso che sono stati i fan a darvi un enorme contributo traducendo e sottotitolando i video e le esibizioni in inglese. I BTS non sono, inoltre, i primi artisti K-pop ad aver ottenuto &nbsp;successo a livello internazionale: in Occidente, ad esempio, PSY &egrave; molto conosciuto, cos&igrave; come lo sono altri gruppi coreani in diversi Paesi dell&rsquo;Asia, dalla Cina al Vietnam, per arrivare al Giappone. </p><p>Ovviamente, come una rondine non fa primavera, per cos&igrave; dire, cos&igrave; non saranno Fonsi e i BTS da soli a cambiare la globalizzazione culturale, ma anche in altri settori nuovi protagonisti culturali sono emersi da realt&agrave; diverse da quella americana e l&rsquo;Asia, in particolare, sta giocando un ruolo fondamentale. </p><p>La prima Intelligenza Artificiale a condurre un telegiornale viene dalla Cina e parla sia il mandarino che l&rsquo;inglese, mentre sempre di pi&ugrave; Hollywood subisce l&rsquo;influenza delle &nbsp;compagnie cinesi e degli attori asiatici con i quali lavora, e degli esempi sono &ldquo;The Great Wall&rdquo; con Matt Damon e Jing Tian, oppure uno dei successi cinematografici &nbsp;del 2018, &ldquo;Crazy Rich Asians&rdquo;, film con un cast completamente asiatico e basato su una serie di libri parimenti di successo. </p><p>Nel settore tecnologico, una delle pi&ugrave; famose compagnie di streaming, &ldquo;Spotify&rdquo;, &egrave; svedese, mentre in quello sportivo, sia i Mondiali di calcio FIFA che i Giochi Olimpici possono vantare di aver celebrato nazioni e culture diverse, pur dovendo affrontare delle critiche per la cattiva gestione della governance. </p><p>Tuttavia per quanto i campioni dell&rsquo;americanizzazione della cultura globale possano essere oggetto di biasimo, alcune delle compagnie pi&ugrave; rappresentative in questo senso hanno condotto il mondo verso un positivo cambiamento culturale. </p><p><b>Il quadro generale</b></p><p>\n\nSaadia Zahidi del World Economic Forum, nel suo libro &ldquo;50 Million Rising&rdquo;, ha scritto che &ldquo;McDonald&rsquo;s&rdquo; &egrave; stata una tra le prime compagnie ad aver integrato nella forza lavoro le donne in Paesi a maggioranza musulmana come l&rsquo;Indonesia e l&rsquo;Arabia Saudita, mentre &ldquo;PepsiCo&rdquo;, sotto la guida del CEO (<i>N/B: &ldquo;direttore d&rsquo;azienda&rdquo;</i>) di origine indiana Indra Nooyi, ha iniziato ad allontanarsi dalla produzione di bevande zuccherate per investire in attivit&agrave; come &ldquo;Sodastream&rdquo; che commercializza l&rsquo;acqua di rubinetto ed evita la plastica. <br /><br />Ma questi sono elementi che potrebbero risultare mancanti al quadro culturale &nbsp;generale del 2018. Il fatto che siano cantanti e gruppi dai Caraibi o dalla Corea a creare i successi musicali pi&ugrave; popolari del mondo dimostra che, dopo tutto, non c&rsquo;&egrave; nulla di inevitabile nel processo di americanizzazione della globalizzazione culturale. <br /><br />Le culture diverse, quasi sicuramente, continueranno ad esistere e ad incrociarsi influenzandosi vicendevolmente come hanno fatto per secoli fino ad ora, ma quello che &egrave; davvero essenziale &egrave; che ognuno abbracci la propria cultura e che i politici e le altre parti interessate rafforzino e promuovano i legami culturali nella societ&agrave;. Ma se i membri di un gruppo musicale del &ldquo;Regno Eremita&rdquo; possono essere eletti come &ldquo;Personalit&agrave; dell&rsquo;anno&rdquo; nella capitale economica del mondo, una monocultura globale non &egrave; poi cos&igrave; vicina, in fondo.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><b><i>Traduzione a cura di Bangtan Italian Channel Subs (&copy;Cam, Clara, jimindipityR) | &copy;weforum</i></b></p></p>",

Well, his work of course.</p><p>It\u2019s complicated to describe\nfor a stranger but to put it simply\u2026 Taehyung was a hitman.</p><p>And you were his\n\u201dassistant\u201d.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t the most\nethical career choice but back then you were desperate for a source of income\nand why would you give up a pay that was enough for you to buy your own cars,\njewelry and designer shoes?</p><p>The question was why\nTaehyung insisted to get these things for you when he clearly knew you had\nmoney enough to get them yourself since he was the one actually paying you.</p><p>\u201dA surprise visit\u201d was a\ncode for a sudden last minute mission, or well, an assassination on short\nnotice\u2026</p><p>Before he had started the\ncar Taehyung handed you the files of the subject for you to look through while\nhe drove the two of you to the post office.</p><p>\u201dHome visit?\u201d You asked, skimming\nthrough the last page.</p><p>\u201dYes, he was supposed to\nreturn from a vacation in bora bora last night so hopefully he\u2019s jetlagged and\nasleep when we get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201dWho called for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201dSame as last time.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung had a couple of\nloyal clients\u2026</p><p>He pulled up in front of the\npost office and you hid the files in the glove compartment of the car.</p><p>The queue was short and you\ngot the package in no time.

As the only possible response to his cries you could\nfigure out was to pull him close again and crash your lips against his. You\nwhipped a tear away with your thumb and he looked into your eyes deeply before\nyou attacked his lips, giving him relief and reassurance.</p><p>He unbuckled his belt so he\ncould get closer and wrapped and arm around you and tangled the other in your\nhair, making sure you wouldn\u2019t pull away for however long he needed you.</p><p>He was calming down and his\nhand in your hair fell to your cheek instead, stroking over your skin softly.\nYour lips parted and he pressed his forehead against yours, catching his breath.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had to quit\nbecause my feelings for you were growing too strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just confess\nto me? I\u2019ve been hurting so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I was too afraid to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy sweetie? I\u2019ve done\neverything my confidence let me to hint to you how important you are for me,\nall the times I\u2019ve held your hand when we\u2019ve run away, when I protect you\u2026 I\nprotect you because I love you.\u201d</p><p>It was getting hard to hold\nback the tears now.</p><p>\u201cAm I dreaming now too?\u201d You\ncried.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is all real\nsweetie. Finally.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be.\u201d He kissed\nyour forehead. \u201cWe need each other, you and I.\u201d He moved your hair to behind\nyour ear.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d he asked\nbravely.</p><p>You hid your mouth behind\nyour hand and nodded, looking down.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He stroked your cheek again\nand you let go of each other. Taehyung put his seatbelt back on and returned to\nthe road carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you properly\nwhen we\u2019re back.\u201d He ensured.</p><p>The short ride remaining\nyour mind was pre-occupied replaying the scene you just experienced over and\nover again. The poison was even stronger than in the dream\u2026 You feelings were\nall over the place in a disorganized mess and all you knew was that you wanted\nhis touch back.</p><p>Taehyung parked the car\nbehind the building and got out, grabbed his bag from the back seat and the box\nfrom the trunk. You took the files with you and you walked towards the back\nentrance of the building. He put the box under his arm and grabbed your hand\nwith his free one.</p><p>Your heart was aching so bad\nit physically hurt.</p><p>Once you returned to the\noffice he put his bag down on the floor and the box as well and quickly walked\nover to his desk and knocked almost everything over.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He ordered and patted\nthe desk.</p><p>He grabbed the filed from\nyou and threw them on the floor, pushing you back to sit on his desk. He placed\nhis hands on your cheeks and stood between your thighs as he crashed his lips against\nyours and slipped his tongue in. Lust mixed with desperate desire.</p><p>His hands fell to your\nthighs and he leaned forward even closer, forcing you to wrap your arms around\nhim to not fall backwards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this for\nso long.\u201d He whispered between the heated kiss.</p><p>Your lust for him was\ngrowing stronger than ever and your hands grabbed onto his belt buckle, tugging\nat it and making you both open your eyes. Your lips parted, faces still closed\nand looking deeply into each other eyes.</p><p>He raised a brow in a\nquestioning expression.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d He asked,\nvoice low.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You confessed and\ncupped his cheek with your hand.</p><p>He moved fast.</p><p>Quickly unbuckled his belt\nand unzipped his jeans, pulling them down with a rough yanking motion along\nwith his boxer and freeing his dick. His hands slid up your thighs and moved\nyour dress up to your waist before he grabbed the sides of your panties and\npulled them down your legs.</p><p>His arms wrapped around your\nwaist and pulled you close and picked you up and he lied you down along the\nside of the desk on your back.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his\nhair.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have time?\u201d You\nasked, supporting yourself up on your elbow.</p><p>\u201cFor a quicky.\u201d</p><p>He hands grabbed your thigh\nand he bent down and without warning his lips touched your wetness and his\ntongue licked up your slit. He moved your thighs to his shoulders and held his\nbalance by holding on to the edge of the desk. You fell back against the hard\nwooden desk top and clenched your thighs tightly at the immense sensation he\nsent through you.</p><p>His lips sucked gently at\nyour clit before his tongue suddenly located you entrance and pushed through.\nIt didn\u2019t last long and he was hasty, he sucked gently at your clit and slipped\nin two fingers and thrusted them slowly.</p><p>\u201cI need to get you nice and\nwet first baby\u2026 I\u2019m quite thick.\u201d</p><p>His words were teasing all\nat its own.</p><p>\u201cI can take it! Please\njust-\u201c</p><p>He fingers left you and he\nstood back up properly, looking down at you with dark eyes.</p><p>He licked his fingers clean\nand placed his hands by your hips, moving them up along your outer thigh.</p><p>\u201cPut your legs over my\nshoulders.\u201d</p><p>You followed his lead and\nhis hands caressed your legs as he got closer.</p><p>You could feel hit tip\nbarely touching you until his hand guided himself between your slit.\nAnticipation mixed with need tortured you.</p><p>You moaned softly as you\nfelt his cock push through and stretch you out.</p><p>He bit his lower lip and\nslid in all the way.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d He\nsmirked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You chuckled almost a\nbit embarrassed, but you had to hurry up now.</p><p>He grip tightened and he\npulled back and thrusted back into you hard with a loud groan and picked up a\nfast pace.</p><p>\u201cNext time I promise this\nwill last for hours, I just want you so bad baby.\u201d He panted.</p><p>You grabbed on to the edges\nof the desk. He felt amazing and you didn\u2019t want it to ever end but you knew\nyou both had to release fast. </p><p>His hands fell to desk edge\nas well and he pushes your legs forward, going deeper and faster with heavy\ngrunts.</p><p>\u201cFuck! This is just like in\nmy dream.\u201d He moaned, followed by a sweet chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou dreamt of fucking me on\nyour desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm, but this is so much\nbetter baby.\u201d He thrusted hard and deep, making you let out a surprised\nwhimper.</p><p>\u201cTell me when you\u2019re close\nbaby.\u201d He urged.</p><p>You reached down with one\nhand to play with your clit to help yourself get there faster but Taehyung\u2019s\nrough speed was almost enough to set you off on its own.</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d You pleaded and bit\nyour lip.</p><p>\u201cFuck you look so sexy\u2026 I\ncan\u2019t wait to see you naked.\u201d He panted and placed a kiss against your leg.</p><p>He whimpered, now chasing\nhis own high as time ran shorter and shorter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum.\u201d He called\nout and thrusted even deeper.</p><p>Your muscles were crying out\nfor relief through numb tingles and you rubbed your clit faster to catch up\nwith him and it got harder and harder to breathe properly and eventually you\njust held on to your own breath as you expected to break at any moment.</p><p>With a deep exhale mixed\nwith the tones of his sweet voice moaning out in pleasure you could feel him\nrelease his cum inside you as you climaxed. You core pulsated tightly and\nbefore you knew it he abruptly pulled out and pushed your legs off his shoulder\nand almost climbed up on the desk just to kiss you. You pushed yourself up to\nsitting to catch his need for kissing you and your lips crashed.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around\nyou and lifted you up to standing. Your legs were still shaken and weak and you\nlost your ability to stand and caught yourself by wrapping your arms around his\nneck, still not breaking the kiss.</p><p>A trail of his cum leaked\ndown your inner thigh.</p><p>Once you regained control\nover your legs you broke the kiss and quickly reached for your underwear to put\nthem back on while Taehyung did up his jeans and belt again. You pulled your\ndress back down over your hips and thighs and grabbed a tissue from the box on\nyour desk in your office and quickly whipped your thigh clean of his release.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d You called out,\nlooking at the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung unlocked his safe\nand handed you your gun and grabbed his own.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the strap.\u201d He said\nand tossed it to you.</p><p>You placed your gun on his\ndesk and quickly tied the strap around your thigh and attached the gun to it,\nthrowing the fabric of the dress down to conceal it.</p><p>You gathered together the\nfiles.</p><p>Taehyung hid his gun by his\nbelt and threw his long coat back on before grabbing yours and your hand and\nrunning out of the building.</p><p>\u201cHere, it\u2019s cold, don\u2019t get\nsick.\u201d He said and placed it over your shoulders for the short run to the car.</p><p>The stress was oddly\narousing and you finally took a seat in the car an hurried away towards your\nlocation.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cBrook Street then left.\u201d\nYou instructed, looking at the files.</p><p>Taehyung switched lanes and\nnoticed how you suddenly squirmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I can still feel\nyour cum leaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cLeft here. And just you\nwait till later\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me hard while\nI\u2019m driving, I don\u2019t want to show up with a throbbing erection.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you that sensitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you yeah. Now where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after this block.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You pulled up in a\nneighborhood of worn down looking houses. The entire block seemed to be in some\nserious need of restoration and renovation.</p><p>Your target lived in one of\nthe small apartment buildings and you quickly made your way over and inside.</p><p>\u201cThird floor, apartment\n1506\u201d you informed as you stepped inside the elevator.</p><p>This was an easy mission\ncompared to what you had have in past.</p><p>Sometimes, in worse cases\npeople had been expecting you and caused it to quickly turn ugly.</p><p>The elevator dinged and you\nand Taehyung stepped out on the third floor and found the right apartment.</p><p>Taehyung pulled his gun out\nand loaded it and hid against the wall right next to the door while you\nknocked.</p><p>It took a few knocking\nattempts until you finally heard someone approach the door from inside.</p><p>A large, annoyed looking man\nopened the door with sleepy eyes. Once he saw you he eyes you up and down in\nyour dress and open coat and looked confused but pleased.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a bathtub?\u201d You\nasked, trying to sound anxious.</p><p>\u201cI so happen to, how come?\u201d</p><p>The click from Taehyung\u2019s\ngun made him freeze as the gun was suddenly aimed at his head.</p><p>You smirked.</p><p>\u201cGet in the tub.\u201d Taehyung\nordered and you both back him inside and closed the door behind.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the tub.\u201d Taehyung\nsaid, more aggressive and poked the gun at his head.</p><p>As you entered the bathroom\nyou threw a quick glance into the apartment and saw the dirty looking at home\nlab in the living room. Did he create drugs of some sort?</p><p>It was none of your\nbusiness, you were here to do your job but it was always curious to know what\nthe causes of these hits were.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scaring me if\nthat\u2019s what you\u2019re here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d You ordered.</p><p>\u201cShut up bitch.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung lowered his gun and\nshot him in the foot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you say\nto her?\u201d</p><p>The man bent down in pain\nand screamed and you pushed him into the bathtub.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it personal.\u201d\nTaehyung threatened and aimed the gun at his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me!?\nI don\u2019t have anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of our\nbusiness, someone just sent us here to wish you good night that\u2019s all.\u201d You\nsmiled.</p><p>He looked confused and a\nsecond later Taehyung pulled the trigger.</p><p>The job was done.</p><p>You pulled out a zip lock\nbag from your bag with a gun and a note in it and Taehyung put on his black\nleather gloves that were in his coat pocket and secured his own gun at his belt\nagain.</p><p>He took the bag from you and\nmade sure to cover the gun with plenty of the man\u2019s own finger prints just as\nwith the note before placing the note in the sink and placing the gun in the\nman\u2019s hand.</p><p>He shoved the zip lock bag\nin his pocket, removed his gloves and grabbed your hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Making it look like\nsomething it wasn\u2019t was something you charged heavily extra for, but what the\nclient wants and pays for, the client gets.</p><p>You set the door to lock\nitself when you left and you got back to the car.</p><p>Taehyung opened the back\ntrunk and inside were two shoe boxes.</p><p>You lifted one of your legs\nup to take your shoe off but Taehyung stopped you.</p><p>\u201cHoney no, sit in the\nbackseat so you don\u2019t have to touch the ground.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t really mind but\nwent to open the back seat door anyway and took a seat sideways so your feet\nwere out of the car.</p><p>After each mission you had\nlike a tradition to always burn your shoes, the only pity was that the shoes\nyou burned were always so expensive. You once suggested for Taehyung that you\nshould get cheap shoes to wear for missions and burn but he refused.</p><p>You had dismissed the\nthought in the past that maybe he enjoyed buying you expensive shoes, and\nburning them was an excuse to buy more as well as wiping away your traces\u2026 but\nhe never said anything about it.</p><p>Before you had the chance to\nkick off your sparkly heels Taehyung rushed over to you and put the shoe box on\nyour lap and bent down. He grabbed your right ankle and slipped the shoe off\nand repeated the same move with your left.</p><p>You opened the box for him\nand to your surprise there were a pair of black Louboutin pumps inside.</p><p>\u201cI thought they\u2019ll look good\non you.\u201d He confessed shyly and took one on of the shoes.</p><p>\u201cAll shoes you pick do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and looked down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like them.\u201d</p><p>He slipped the shoe on and\nyou giggled, feeling almost like Cinderella.</p><p>Taehyung grabbed the other\nshoe and slipped it on as well.</p><p>\u201cAre they comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey feel good.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stood back up and\ngrabbed your old Jimmy Choo\u2019s and placed them in the box for you. You moved the\nbox off your lap and into the seat behind you and Taehyung held out a hand to\nhelp you up and out of the car.</p><p>They were beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI know you should never buy\nshoes for a love because the soles wear out, but they never get the chance to\nsince we burn them.\u201d He smiled proudly and closed the door behind him.</p><p>He quickly changed his own\nshoes, getting out of his shiny Dior shoes and into a brown pair of loafers.</p><p>\u201cGucci?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>He closed the trunk and you\nboth got back into the car.</p><p>\u201cWe have dinner left on our\nschedule.\u201d You pointed out once he started the car.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his wide smile\nthat had your heart melting.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a place in mind.\u201d He\nsaid mysteriously and tapped the screen display in the car to call.</p><p>The person that picked up\nvoiced a short hello.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>You took a short detour back\nto the office and picked up your things and the parcel from earlier before\nheading to dinner.</p><p>Taehyung drove a somewhat\nfamiliar route before stopping by a gate into a gated community of large lavish\nhouses.</p><p>You remembered very well\nthat Taehyung lived here.</p><p>In his backyard was a cozy\nfire pit and that\u2019s where you\u2019d burn your shoes.</p><p>\u201cAre we burning the shoes\nfirst?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to\u2026 We\u2019re\nhaving dinner at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to cook for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d You\nconfessed shyly.</p><p>This warm domestic side was\nsomething you would never get tired of seeing and now when he was finally\nyours\u2026 you could see his warm smile whenever, his heart finally at ease and\nburning with a new type of fire.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The sun was setting and\nTaehyung threw a few more logs into the fire followed by you tossing your shoes\ninto the fire. You reached down and picked his Diors up and tossed them into\nthe fire as well.</p><p>You had never really had the\nchance to properly explore his large house.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a house\ntour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never explored, I\u2019ve\nnever seen your room or the upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He looked surprised.</p><p>You pulled the blanket over\nyour shoulders tighter around you and nodded.</p><p>He put an arm around you and\nwalked you back inside through the large terrace doors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much too see but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI doubt it! I want to see\nyour closet too, you always dress so nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>You left the blanket on the\nsofa in the living room downstairs and ran up the stairs before Taehyung.</p><p>The first door led into a\nlarge master bedroom with a huge bed made neatly with decorative pillows.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but I never sleep in\nit.\u201d Taehyung said, catching up to you.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bed is too big. It\nmakes me feel lonely.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him with\npitiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d say that.\u201d He\nleaned in and kissed you softly.</p><p>You could say that\u2019s where\nit all started a few months ago\u2026</p><p>When everything finally\nchanged.</p><p>Oh yeah, the package!</p><p>It did contain diamonds like\nhe said\u2026 but in form of a dainty choker, made for you.</p><p>The entire piece was lined\nwith tiny diamonds and you didn\u2019t dare consider what it could possibly be\nworth. Another of his expensive gifts in a desperate attempt to charm you, when\nhe had already been successful in doing so\u2026</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>His sleepy\nvoice was deep and raspy, making you almost shiver when he whispered in your\near.</p><p>Taehyung\nwas cuddled up tightly against your body from behind, spooning you with a\nstrong arm wrapped snug around your waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d\nHe pouted and nuzzled the back of your neck gently.</p><p>\u201cPut\nsomething on.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be a\nlot warmer if he just wore pajamas instead of getting right into bed fully\nnude\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d </p><p>You giggled\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cThen\nyou\u2019ll have to hug me harder.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed\nyou and you made a playful suffocating sound, making him chuckle.</p><p>He hummed\nsoftly and his grip loosened and he placed his hand on your hip, by the hem of\nyou pajama shorts.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nwhat I mean.\u201d He whispered, sounding pleading.</p><p>He pulled\nyour shorts down over your hip slowly and of course you had suspected his hint\neven before that but it was fun to play games with his needs sometimes.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d\nhis tone was sultry and you bit your lip as he continued sliding your shorts\ndown your thighs.</p><p>You hummed\na yes and kicked your shorts of the remaining way under the covers and Taehyung\nmoved even closer, pressing his hips against your butt. He quickly reached over\nyou for the tiny bottle of lube conveniently placed on your nightstand table\nand coated his cock with a few drops before throwing the bottle on the floor.\nHe pulled you back by the hips, positioning you in a pose that would make it\neasier for him to slide in.</p><p>The covers\nruffled softly from all the movement and suddenly you felt the tip of his cock\ndrag between your lower lips before pushing through. He let out a short low\ngroan and positioned himself by your entrance before thrusting into you\ncarefully. His thickness stretched you out slightly and the position you were\nin with your thighs clenched together made it feel like an even tighter fit.</p><p>He pushed\nin deep and pulled you back even more to take more of his cock. His arm\nreturned to your waist and he exhaled deeply with a soft moan and rested his\nhead against the pillow; his deep breathing tickled the back of your neck and\neventually you drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Having his\ncock inside you like that was something you both loved. In some way it was cozy\nand comfortable, but an intimate version of being so. Softly clenching around\nhim and feeling yourself get almost incredibly wet from just his still presence\nwas amazing. Sometimes the two of you grew so horny it just became impossible\nto feel asleep that way and you ended up fucking instead and then passing out\nto sleep from exhaustion; Also a great outcome.</p><p>The worst\npart for both of you was when he had to pull out or if he accidently slipped\nout during your sleep. At one time he had cum in his sleep from a dream and\nwhen he pulled out a trail of his cum leaked down your thighs.</p><p>You thought\nit was funny, but Taehyung was embarrassed.</p><p>The last\nthing you felt before falling asleep were his soft lips pressing delicately\nagainst your neck, giving you a gentle kiss good night.</p><p>You moved in with him not\ntoo long ago and you finally made use of his large comfortable bed for more\nthan just sleeping.</p><p>Your old penthouse apartment\nwas up for sale and you were glad you got the chance to invite Taehyung over to\nyour place a few times before he begged you to move in with him.</p><p>Well, a few might sounds\nless than it was but having him stay the night hugging you from behind, his\nnude skin against yours\u2026 was something you wouldn\u2019t give up for the world,\nespecially not after sex.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t get enough of\neach other.</p><p>Almost every night one of\nyou made the other scream out in pleasure.</p><p>There was no shame.</p><p>Some days you\u2019d wake him up\nunder the sheets by sucking him off and other days he\u2019d tickle your clit to\nwake you up and fuck you before breakfast. There was no end to it. You lust for\neach other was stronger than any force.</p><p>The office, the car, every\nroom of the house\u2026 once even at the very end of a mission.</p><p>May that have been\ncontroversial\u2026 but something came over both of you that day while still wearing\nyour soon to be burned shoes\u2026</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>That night you woke up\nbriefly by soft whimpers coming from your love behind you. His cock was on the\nvery edge of slipping out of your heat and it was a teasing sensation, you\nwanted him deep and right where he was, was dangerously close to one of your sweet\nspots. You wiggled your hips carefully and caused him to slip out fully for\nyour own relief and fell back to sleep.</p><p>A couple of hours later you\nwoke up first and carefully moved out of his hold to lie on your stomach beside\nhim to half-sleep until he would wake up.</p><p>He was breathing softly next\nto you and you couldn\u2019t help but admire this sleeping beauty.</p><p>He blinked a few times and finally woke\nup, stretching out his lean arms with a groan.<br/>\nHe eyed you up and down as you lied on your stomach next to him and his tongue\nlicked across his lip. </p><p>\u201cNice view to wake up to.\u201d He said,\nadmiring your naked body with a smirk. </p><p>You smiled and leaned close to kiss his\nsoft lips good morning.<br/>\n\u201cCome here baby.\u201d He begged and sat up, leaning against the head board with one\narm resting on top of it as he patted on his thigh for you to come sit.<br/>\nYou moved your leg over and straddled him, his hands landing on your lower\nback, stroking up and down as you leaned closer to him. </p><p><br/>\n\u201cWhat were you dreaming about?\u201d You asked.<br/>\n\u201cOh\u2026 I don\u2019t remember.\u201d <br/>\n\u201cYou were whimpering in your sleep.\u201d You teased, making him giggle in\nembarrassment.<br/>\nHe pushed against your back, making you press tight against him so his mouth\nwas right by your ear.<br/>\n\u201cI dreamt\u2026\u201d He whispered. \u201cThat I was fucking your tight little pussy with my\ncock\u2026 Hard\u2026 And you had your hands\u2026\u201d He grabbed your hands, placing them on his\nchest. \u201cHere\u2026 While I was pounding into you, making you scream for more than\nyou could handle.\u201d He nibbled at your earlobe gently.</p><p><br/>\nHis story definitely tied a knot within you. <br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m so needy for you baby\u2026\u201d He said sultry and twirled and strand of your hair.<br/>\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that Mr. Kim.\u201d You grinned and looked down, seeing how his\nmorning wood had developed into a full hard erection, thick and likely\nthrobbing. <br/>\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d He begged, biting down on his lip as his hand moved down to your\nbutt.<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been such a good girl lately\u2026.\u201d<br/>\nA good girl?<br/>\nYou smirked and jumped off of him and got down from the bed.<br/>\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked in a serious concerned tone.<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m having a shower, what are you waiting for?\u201d You smirked and curled your\nfingers in a come here motion as you headed towards the bathroom.<br/>\nYou heard the rustle of the sheets behind you and the sound of his feet\ntouching the floor.</p><p>You entered the bathroom, Taehyung\nfollowing behind and you stepped into the spacious rain shower together.</p><p><br/>\nThe water started falling over the two of you.<br/>\nTaehyung grabbed your hips and pressed himself close against your butt, his\ncock rubbing against you cheek.<br/>\n\u201cBaby\u2026I want you so bad right now.\u201d He groaned. You pressed your butt against\nhim firmer, wanting to tease him.<br/>\nGood girl? Tsk\u2026\u00a0</p><p><br/>\nYou turned around and looked into his dark eyes filled with lust and his lips\nparted slightly. </p><p>His hands were already all over your\nbody, caressing and tracing your every curve.<br/>\nYou placed a finger under his chin and pressed your lips against his. He\npressed you closer to his wet body and desperately tried to deepen the kiss,\nbut you wouldn\u2019t let him. </p><p>You bit down gently on his lip and\npulled away.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d He panted, leaning in to suck on your neck but you backed away.<br/>\nHe stared at you intensely as you grabbed the shower gel and poured a generous\namount over your breasts and started to lather in your entire body.\u00a0<br/>\nTaehyung leaned back against the tiles, his hand wrapped tight around his\nshaft. <br/>\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.&ldquo; he pleaded, eyes not leaving your body for a mere\nsecond.</p><p><br/>\nYou let the soap wash off your body and continued moving your hands over your\nbody. You slipped your hand down between your folds and swirled a circle over\nyour clit.<br/>\n&quot;Ah&hellip; Taehyung\u2026\u201d You moaned, knowing this would make him mad. </p><p>He didn\u2019t like it when you touched\nyourself, especially not when he was rock hard and needy for you.</p><p><br/>\nJust a second later you were impatiently pushed against the cold tiles in the\nshower, your breasts squeezed against the wall and with Taehyung\u2019s hands on\nyour hips. <br/>\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He asked with his mouth right by\nyour ear. </p><p>\u201cYou know what that does to me.\u201d His\ntone was angry.<br/>\n\u201cNow let me fuck you like the good girl you are before I punish you like the\nbad girl you\u2019re trying to be.\u201d<br/>\nYou nodded. <br/>\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d<br/>\nHis hand slid down the outside of your thighs as he squatted down behind you.<br/>\nHe parted your lower lips with his fingers and didn\u2019t hesitate before pushing\ntwo of them in. You bit down on your lip and suppressed a moan as he roughly\nthrusted his fingers in and out, the only reason being to stretch you out for\nhim.<br/>\nHe curled his fingers inside you causing you to clench lightly around them and\nhe pulled out.<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019re ready, bend down.\u201d He ordered and you did as told, more than ready to\nscream his name.</p><p><br/>\nAs you bent down you looked over your shoulder, seeing his cock throb in his\nhand as it slid up and down with pre-cum dripping from the tip.<br/>\nHe placed a hand on your butt cheek and dragged his cock up and down your slit.<br/>\nHe placed his tip by your entrance and slowly began pushing himself in, groans\nescaping his mouth and yours as he stretched you out even more.</p><p><br/>\n\u201cFuck you\u2019re still too tight.\u201d He whined and pulled out.<br/>\n\u201cI can take it!\u201d You yelled, desperate for him to keep going.<br/>\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked, the sweet tone suddenly returning.<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m sure! Just fuck me!\u201d You yelled, feeling your walls pulsating, desperate\nfor him.<br/>\nHe began pushing himself into you again, groaning immensely as he slipped in\nall the way, making you moan loud followed by a deep exhale.<br/>\nHe caressed your right butt cheek, staying still inside you, allowing you the\ntime to adjust.</p><p><br/>\nA little whimper from you and he began to pull out and thrusted back in slowly.<br/>\n\u201cFaster.\u201d You panted. </p><p>He increased his speed slightly but it\ndidn\u2019t last for long before he gave into his own need and began pounding into\nyou fast and hard, the two of you becoming a moaning mess.<br/>\nTaehyung\u2019s grip on your hips tightened, signaling that he was close.<br/>\n\u201cFuck\u201d he grunted and thrusted harder, hitting you to the limit.<br/>\n\u201cTae- I-I\u2019m gonna-\u201d you panted and he thrusted faster.<br/>\n\u201cYeah baby.\u201d He panted.<br/>\nA few more thrusts and he pushed himself in deep and hard making your orgasm\nhit you hard and clench tightly around him, making him cum hard with a grunt.</p><p>You breathed heavily as he carefully\npulled out of you, some of his cum leaking out as he did.<br/>\nHe hastily wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled your back up against\nhim and kissed your cheek.\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d He whispered and chuckled lightly.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You typed away at the computer in your\noffice, checking the website you ran for the business and updated the filter to\nkeep out any \u201cunserious\u201d clients.</p><p>Of course the website wasn\u2019t something\nyou could simply google.</p><p>If you knew the url it would quickly\nbecome unusable as you changed the name of the website frequently as well as\nthe contact email.</p><p>\u201cSweetie?\u201d Taehyung suddenly called.</p><p>You stood up from your seat and walked\ninto his office. He was leaned forward at his laptop on his desk with a\nthoughtful expression.</p><p>As you walked up to him you stroked your\nhand over his shoulder before wrapping your arms around his neck and leaning\ndown by the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese or these?\u201d He moved the tiny\narrow on the screen around a pair of shoes and then clicked another tab and\nshowed another pair of shoes.</p><p>\u201cMission or leisure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeisure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the first ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want matching ones?\u201d He asked\nshyly, turning to his side to look at you.</p><p>\u201cAre there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly the same, but I found a\npair of heels that were in similar style.\u201d He clicked them up to show you the beautiful\nheels.</p><p>\u201cYou really like it when I wear heels\nhuh?\u201d You giggled.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He kissed your cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re conveniently here I need\nyou to have a look at this email.\u201d </p><p>Taehyung quickly searched up the email\nin the inbox and opened it for you to read.</p><p>-No subject.-</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to be a joke?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought the same. I\u2019m changing the\nemail just in case though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me when you have so I can update\nit on the page, I just changed the url of it.\u201d</p><p>You stood up straight and caressed his\nneck before abandoning him of your touch.</p><p>Before you managed to take a second step\ntowards your office your wrist was grabbed and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung moved his chair back from his\ndesk slightly and patted his lap with his other hand.</p><p>Just for a short while\u2026 you thought and\nwalked over to sit on his thighs.</p><p>\u201cCan you work like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can.\u201d He said and rested\nhis chin on your shoulder and reached for his computer with one arm on either\nside of you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the way.\u201d You laughed and moved\nto get back off but his arms quickly wrapped around your waist, stopping you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed you tightly around the hips\nand pulled you back against him properly so you were sitting over his crotch,\nwhere he wanted you.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t sit still, but stay.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>He ignored his work and began kissing\nyour neck softly.</p><p>You held on to the arm rests carefully\nand moved your hips in a slow teasing motion.</p><p>\u201cJust like that baby.\u201d He whispered,\nsatisfied by the gentle friction.</p><p>\u201cCan you wear the diamond necklace for\nme tonight? You haven\u2019t worn it since I got it for you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s precious to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I know you ah- yes right there baby\u2026\nIf I know you right, you\u2019re afraid to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s real diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd diamonds are replaceable. If anything\nhappens to it I\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201d </p><p>You could feel his hard on growing\nbetween his thighs and you grinded against him a little harder. His hands moved\nto your hips to control your movements but to your surprise he stopped you.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d </p><p>You looked at the time on the corner of\nhis laptop.</p><p>\u201cAlmost five.\u201d</p><p>He patted your thigh two times.</p><p>\u201cThe jewelry shop closes soon, we can\nmake it if we hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait why are we going there now?\u201d You\nasked confused and got up.</p><p>\u201cI want to buy you more diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung no.:\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d He said and got up\nfrom his chair. \u201cGet your coat, it\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>You stopped him in his steps by grabbing\nhis arms.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>You pointed down, trying to suffocate a\ngiggle.</p><p>He looked down at his bulge straining\nagainst his jeans.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Driving slightly over the speed limit\nyou made it to the shop right on time just before closing.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t given up on trying to talking\nhim out of getting you more expensive stuff yet, but you were near to. He was\nso stubborn and claimed that you\u2019d be more comfortable wearing the diamonds if\nyou had more of them which certainly wasn\u2019t true. But if it made him happy\u2026 </p><p>You sighed.</p><p>Taehyung immediately walked over to the\ndisplays of necklaces but your attention was caught by a pair of dainty\nearrings in one of the glass cabinets.</p><p>It seemed to be part of a collection as\nit was displayed next to a necklace, bracelet and ring in similar style. You\nlooked at the ring for a while and quickly shook off the feeling it gave you\nand moved on to the next display.</p><p>On dark blue velvet were a pair of\nsilver platted cufflinks and they immediately caught your liking.</p><p>They were expensive and you recognized\nthe luxury brand labelled next the price, but as someone who was paid well and\nwithout taxes you could afford to splurge on something for Taehyung\u2026 if he now\ninsisted on getting you something you could insist on getting him something as\nwell.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you Madame?\u201d A voice\nsuddenly asked behind you.</p><p>The name tag on the right side of his\nchest made it obvious that he worked in the shop and in regards of the dream\nyou had long ago, he was fairly young to your relief.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to buy these.\u201d You smiled\nand pointed towards the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cExcellent choice, they\u2019re from the\nnewest collection too. We received it last week.\u201d He smiled and grabbed the key\nto the cabinet hung on his belt.</p><p>Taehyung turned around and looked at you\nwith an odd look before making his way over.</p><p>\u201cDid you find something?\u201d</p><p>You nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cNot for me though.\u201d</p><p>The employee carefully picked up the\ncufflinks and locked the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back with the box.\u201d He\nsaid and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWho are you getting them for?\u201d He asked\nin a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cFor you of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d You teased with a\nsmile. \u201cI found something I like for myself as well though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe earrings.\u201d You said and pointed\ntowards them behind the glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Only them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me everything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else? Bracelets? Rings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRings?\u201d You giggled.</p><p>His cheeks went red but his serious\nexpression remained.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung you don\u2019t need to get me\neverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>The young employee returned with the\ncufflinks in a dark blue velvet box and wrapped it up neatly in a paper bag.</p><p>You walked over to the counter and paid\nfor the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d you smiled and took the\nbag.</p><p>While Taehyung received help getting the\nearrings you looked around in the rest of the shop. You spotted a pearl\nnecklace, it could be a choker as well but it was hard to tell from the way it\nwas displayed. Taehyung would look good in pearls\u2026</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d Taehyung suddenly asked\nwith a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, are you done?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI got you a bracelet too.\u201d</p><p>You looked down in defeat and took his\nhand in yours and you left the store.</p><p>The street outside was oddly calm and\nyou glanced around and saw a clothing shop and a hardware store further down the\nstreet.</p><p>\u201cOh that reminds me! Can we go to the\nhardware store quickly?\u201d Taehyung suddenly asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some basic tools.\u201d</p><p>You headed towards the hardware store\nthat was luckily open till later and found a basic tool box. Taehyung went to\nlook for a saw quickly and you walked up and down a random aisle and found\nvarious ropes. You felt one of them and the texture was strong and straw like.</p><p>A member of staff walked down the aisle\nand you quickly grabbed her attention.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, can I get three meters of\nthis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She smiled and grabbed a\nmeasuring tape from her pocket and began to measure out the length of the rope\nbefore cutting it off and rolling it up for you.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cRope?\u201d Taehyung questioned as he joined\nyou in the line to pay.</p><p>\u201cDid you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but why are you getting rope?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor fun.\u201d You smirked.</p><p>\u201cThe same fun why I need these tools?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>You walked back to the car with all your\nstuff and finally headed back home.</p><p>You knew why he needed the tools\u2026 your\nnext mission meant the two of you had to go somewhat undercover\u2026</p><p>He parked the car outside the house and\nyou brought everything inside.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you.\u201d You smiled and handed\nTaehyung the bag from jewelry shop.</p><p>He eagerly opened it, excited to have a\ncloser look at the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you baby.\u201d He smiled shyly and\ngave you a soft kiss.</p><p>\u201cI got something for you too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you!?\u201d You acted surprised, making\nyou both giggle.</p><p>The bracelet matched the earrings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing these tonight.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>You had a table booked at one of the\nfancier restaurants in town tonight, for date-night</p><p>After a refreshing shower you touched up\nyour makeup and got into a black fitted, shape flattering dress paired with the\ndiamond choker necklace and the dainty earrings. Taehyung wore a white shirt,\nwithout a crease to be seen and the cufflinks decorating the end of his sleeves\nwith a sparkle of shine. Paired with it were a pair of black slacks, black belt\nwith a silver buckle in the same tone as the cufflinks and a pair of dark red\nvelvet loafers.</p><p>Hand in hand looking expensive\u2026 there\nwas something about it that made you smile. Was this what power felt like?\nConfidence? The fact that you were wearing multiple tiny diamonds around your\nneck probably worth more than a few cars?</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d He smirked,\nadmiring you while lifting his glass to take a sip.</p><p>His gaze was burning in a way that made\nyou feel like he was eating you rather than the food.</p><p>\u201cIf only you knew what I had planned\nlater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanned?\u201d he looked intrigued. </p><p>\u201cTell me more\u201d</p><p>You slowly traced your fingers up and\ndown the thin stem of your glass.</p><p>Soft jazzy lounge music was surrounding\nyou.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about\nroleplaying?\u201d You said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cRoleplaying? Like police officer or maid\ntype roleplay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of\u2026 but I was thinking more of a\nhostage situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take you hostage?\u201d He\nsmirked.</p><p>Oh how wrong he was\u2026</p><p>You lifted your glass to your lips and\nleft him unanswered.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung took your coat for you and hung\nit up together with his own once you got back home.</p><p>Once he turned back around you grabbed\nthe collar of his shirt and kissed him roughly. </p><p>Before he could react you had already\npulled away.</p><p>His hands landed on your hips.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs, get undressed and wait on\nthe chair in the bedroom.\u201d You ordered.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret it. You\u2019re my hostage\nnow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me waiting too long.\u201d He\nsmirked and broke free from your hold and headed towards the stairs,\nunbuttoning his shirt at the same time.</p><p>You had placed the chair in the middle\nof the bedroom right before you left for the restaurant.</p><p>It was your turn to have some fun.</p><p>You pulled your dress over your head,\nrevealing the black lace body you were wearing underneath and hung it over the\nstaircase the railing as you walked up.</p><p>In Taehyung\u2019s office stood the bag from\nthe hardware store and you pulled out the rope before making your way to the\nbedroom.</p><p>Taehyung was leaned back against the\nchair with one arm over his waist as he stroked his cock slowly.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and stop touching\nyourself.\u201d You ordered, hiding the rope behind your back.</p><p>He did as told and hid his smirk behind\nhis long fingers that caressed his lips.</p><p>\u201cSit properly.\u201d</p><p>He sat up with his back to the backrest\nand you pulled the rope around him.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>You wrapped it around him twice,\nsecuring his arms to his sides and tied it behind.</p><p>You dragged your hand along his jaw as\nyou walked to stand in front of him and then placed them firmly against his\nthighs.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>You moved your hands further up his\ntoned thighs and he opened his eyes.</p><p>At the sight of your outfit a wide smirk\nspread across his face and he poked his cheek with his tongue. He looked down\nat the rope around his body, his erection and your hands and back to your face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>You spread his thighs apart and took a\nseat on his left one, crossing a leg over your other and rested your arm\nagainst his shoulder, grabbing his earlobe.</p><p>\u201cYou have adorable ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do to me?\u201d he asked\nagain.</p><p>You caressed his jaw and tilted his face\nto your side and leaned in towards his lips, leaving little to no space\nbetween. He leaned forward and you backed slightly, making him lean forward\neven more, desperate for your kiss until the rope held him back and his arms\nstrained against it.</p><p>You giggled.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019d do if I got out of\nthese ropes huh?\u201d He asked in a cocky threatening tone.</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the head of\nhis cock and let him slide through your tight grip, making him whimper loudly.</p><p>\u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>You let go of him, starting your build\nup for his desperation.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to be a bit\ndisciplined.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close again, brushing his nose\nagainst your cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me beg for you?\u201d\nHe whispered sultry.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d You grabbed his neck with\none hand and pushed him back.</p><p>His fringe barely covered his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it was for me to\nhold back earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d You let your hand\nslide down his neck to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI already have a build-up, be nice.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the head of his cock again\nand slid your hand off it, making him lean his head back and whimper once more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby- please\u2026 please be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>You got off his thigh and hunched down\nbetween his thighs and placed a soft his against the tip of his sensitive cock\nbefore swirling your tongue around it. He leaned his head back, giving you a\nview of his thick neck.</p><p>You moved your hair to the side and took\noff your diamond choker and stood back up.</p><p>\u201cIt would look good on you.\u201d You smirked\nand straddled his thigh as you put the choker around his neck.</p><p>You placed two fingers under his chin\nand leaned in to kiss him, finally giving him what he wanted.</p><p>You slipped your tongue in, immediately\nclaiming dominance of the kiss before tangling your hands in his hair and\ntugging at it gently.</p><p>One of your hands fell to his neck\ninstead and stroked down his chest and abdomen to the base of his cock. You\nwrapped your hand around his thick shaft and began jerking him off, making him\nmoan against the kiss.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna cum for me?\u201d You\nwhispered, briefly pulling away from the kiss and suffocating his response with\nyour lips and tongue, making him only possible to give out a long whimper in\nrhythm with your hand\u2019s movements.</p><p>His whimpers grew more frequent and you\ncaressed his tip with your thumb.</p><p>He was breathing heavily and you pulled\naway from the kiss to allow him to catch his breath and hear his sweet moans as\nyou jerked him off faster. He leaned his head back and cursed and you moved\nyour hand from his hair to his neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u201d</p><p>You pulled your hand away.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! Please don\u2019t stop!\u201d He squirmed.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Ah- Fuck!\u201d His breathing got\nheavier and his thigh quivered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me cum!\u201d</p><p>You ignored his begging and stood up and\ntook a step back to stand in front of him as you reached for the shoulder of\nyour lace body and slipped it down.</p><p>His breathing was calming down and his\nhead leaned down and he looked up at you with an intimidating frown.</p><p>Small bead of sweat had formed by his\nchest, making his skin glow.</p><p>You slipped the other side down your\nshoulder and pulled the lace down to your waist, exposing your breasts. You\nwalked over to your nightstand table, out of Taehyung\u2019s view and grabbed a hair\ntie to tie up your hair.</p><p>When you returned to him you took a seat\non your knees between his legs.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard I\u2019m going to fuck\nyou for that?\u201d He muttered.</p><p>You flicked your finger across his tip\nand he winced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lay you across my lap and\nspank you until you beg for my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>\u201cI dare you to do your worst baby&hellip;\nJust know I\u2019ll get you back for it\u201d</p><p>You snorted and rolled your eyes at him.\nA mere second later he bit his lip hard as you grabbed his aching cock and\nswirled your tongue around the tip.</p><p>You took his head into your mouth and\nsucked gently and he hummed in pleasure, leaning his head back.</p><p>\u201cDo I taste good baby?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>His bratty attitude was becoming more\nand more of a burden\u2026</p><p>You pulled him out of your mouth and\nstood back up with a serious expression.</p><p>His gaze travelled up your entire body,\nadmiring the view as you took off the lace completely, leaving you fully nude.</p><p>You sat down on his thigh again and\ntangled one hand in his hair, pushing his head away from you to stretch out his\nneck before your lips attacked it, right above the diamonds that decorated him.\nWith your other hand your swirled you finger around his tip. He inhaled sharply\nand you let out a low long whimper by his neck, knowing it would drive him\ncrazy.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026\u201d</p><p>You got up without breaking your touch\nand straddled his thigh and started to grind down on him. Moving back and\nforth, creating friction for yourself that made your desire and arousal grow\nworse. You let out another moan and lowered your hand in a fist over his cock\nand jerked him off teasingly slow. </p><p>Holding your balance was a struggle so\nyou got up and let go of his cock instead and he looked disappointed till you\npushed his thighs closer together and straddled him properly over his hips.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d He smirked, hoping you\u2019d finally\nride him.</p><p>You put your hands on his neck and\ncrashed your lips against his. You could feel his cock throb by your thigh and\nhe strained against the ropes, pointlessly trying to get closer to you.</p><p>He leaned his head back and managed to\nbreak the kiss, slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cPlease touch me.\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cBaby please, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me that bad?\u201d You caressed his\ncheek.</p><p>\u201cI always want you! I want you so\nfucking bad! But I\u2019m gonna go crazy if you either don\u2019t remove these ropes so I\ncan push you down onto my cock myself or if you ride me baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my hostage; I\u2019m not setting you\nfree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please.\u201d He pleaded, looking\nhelpless.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>You reached down between you to grab his\ncock.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He begged again, looking\npitiful.</p><p>You positioned the tip by your entrance\nand he didn\u2019t dare say anything, afraid his words would make you change your\nmind.</p><p>You lowered yourself and he moaned\nloudly. With your hands on his shoulders you allowed him to slide in all the\nway slowly.</p><p>\u201cFuck you\u2019re so tight\u2026\u201d He groaned and\nsquirmed, moving his thighs.</p><p>Your own relief distracted you and you\nbegan to ride him to get some pleasure for yourself.</p><p>He was so sensitive to your touch by now\nthat he turned into a moaning mess by the least amount of movement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d He begged, panting.</p><p>His big eyes looked innocent, something\nyou wouldn\u2019t fall for.</p><p>You went faster and deeper, making his\nthighs tense. You brushed his hair away from his face by pulling it all back\nand he groaned.</p><p>\u201cJust let me hold your thighs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed onto his broad shoulders to\nsupport yourself as you tried to ride him even faster, quickly sending him\nclose to his desperate release.</p><p>\u201cPlease let me cum baby.\u201d He whispered,\nalmost inaudible.</p><p>He let out a long groan that grew\ngradually higher in pitch and finishes in almost a whimper.</p><p>\u201cJust a little more.\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cA little more- ah-\u201c</p><p>The knot in your core was starting to\nbreak lose and you could feel yourself coming closer and closer to your own\nrelease but you didn\u2019t want to let him cum\u2026 not yet\u2026 only one more time and\nyou\u2019d let him have it his way after, but was it worth giving up your own build\nup?</p><p>\u201cBaby I\u2019m gonna cum, don\u2019t stop, please\nI\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close too aren\u2019t you? Let\u2019s cum\ntogether baby, don\u2019t let this go.\u201d He tried to convince followed by a loud\nmoan.</p><p>His entire body tensed up beneath you\nand you pushed yourself up and his cock slipped out of you, throbbing.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this to me!?\u201d He cried\nout.</p><p>He was breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cBaby I give up, it hurts, I need to\ncum!\u201d</p><p>He tried to pull his arms out of the\nrope but you held his shoulders in place, trying to stop him.</p><p>You lowered yourself over his cock again\nand he threw his head back with a frustrated scream</p><p>You wrapped your arms around his neck\nand chased your own release, skin slapping against skin as your rode him deep\nand hard.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna cum for me baby?\u201d You\nasked.</p><p>His answer was pointless as he moaned\nout loud and you could feel his load release within you.</p><p>He cursed and his skin was glowing from\nthe sweat and his chest was moving rapidly up and down. You reached down to rub\nyour clit to get closer to your release, beginning to feel bad for him\u2026</p><p>Your muscles clenched and tingled and\nyour bit your lip as you found your well built up climax and milked his cock of\nevery last drop of cum he had to offer. When you moved up his throbbing cock\nslipped out and landed on his thigh, followed by a stream of his cum spilling.</p><p>He coughed softly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d you caressed his cheek and\nhe looked at you with his wide eyes and an exhausted expression.</p><p>\u201cUntie me.\u201d</p><p>Was he mad?</p><p>You carefully got off him, your thighs\nquivering slightly and untied the rope. Before you had the chance to get it off\nof him he had yanked it off himself and stood up and grabbed you with both arms\ntight.</p><p>His lips found your and he kissed you\nhard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking amazing.\u201d He groaned,\nvoice shaky and legs weak.</p><p>\u201cJust you wait for my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were mad for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never cum that hard before.\u201d He\nwhispered, like a dirty little secret being confessed.</p><p>He walked over to the bed on shaky legs\nand fell down on it.</p><p>\u201cJust you wait.\u201d He groaned. \u201dNow come\nhere and soothe me and show me that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you needy for some aftercare now?\u201d\nyou giggled and walked over to the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, you did well.\u201d You climbed up by\nhis side and ruffled his hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d He muttered and snuggled\nup against you.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Warm under the covers, head and hand on\nhis chest and soft breathing\u2026</p><p>But you were suddenly woken up by\nTaehyung abruptly sitting up, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d You groaned and looked up at him\nconfused.</p><p>He looked panicked.</p><p>\u201care you ok?\u201d You asked worried.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI- I had a nightmare\u2026 its ok.\u201d He said\nin a deep hoarse voice.</p><p>He lied back down again and you took\nyour spot on his chest back and caressed him softly with your hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry I woke you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. What did you\ndream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, it\u2019s ok now and you\u2019re\nhere with me.\u201d He rolled on to his side and pulled you close.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like nothing to me if\nit was enough to wake you up baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, just go back to sleep now \u2026\nand don\u2019t let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and tightened his hold to make\nyou stop.</p><p>You kissed his cheek and put your arm around\nhis waist.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung was still knocked out fast\nasleep when you woke up in the morning, but you kept your promise and held on\nto him tight until he finally would wake up.</p><p>You both slept in and Taehyung woke up a\nlittle while later and you peppered his face with a bunch of kisses, making him\ngiggle and wake up in one of the best ways possible.</p><p>You caressed his cheek with your hand\nand he smiled and looked at you lovingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy I have you.\u201d He confessed,\nmaking you smile shyly.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream that you were taken away\nfrom me and I felt so lost and I kept running around looking for you without\nknowing where to even look and I panicked and then I woke up and it was such a\nrelief to see you on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, ever.\u201d You\nensured.</p><p>He took your hand from his face and\npressed his lips against it softly.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>You both took the day off today since\nworking from home was highly risky\u2026</p><p>You were seated in the office and looked\nthrough your private emails, clearing your inbox and saving whatever was of\nimportance while Taehyung was in the shower.</p><p>You checked your spam in case something\nhad been miss-categorized and spotted an email with a subject from a weird\nlooking email address.</p><p>You clicked it open and read it.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, changing your\nemails won\u2019t keep me away.</p><p>10 million, if you kill the person I\nwant dead.\u201d</p><p>How did this person get a hold of your\nprivate email!?</p><p>It felt pointless to block them but you\ndid anyway, they could just send you another email from another address unless\nyou entirely blocked the IP.</p><p>You ignored it.</p><p>If they wanted your help, they had to\ncontact you through your work email.</p><p>10 million? You could pull a finger nail\nfor that but kill? What cheapskate was this?</p><p>There were plenty of people out there\nthat would kill for that but you and Taehyung were professionals.</p><p>You had loyal clients, high officials\nfor companies who knew you and you were loyal to.</p><p>Some even sent you Christmas cards.</p><p>It was a dark underground business full\nof risks and you didn\u2019t kill for anyone\u2026</p><p>After some quick clicks you managed to\nget the IP blocked from your email account and deleted the email.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first or second time you\nheard \u201cI know who you are\u201d. People knew of you within the business but they\ndidn\u2019t know who you were. It was a cheap trick to seem intimidating and with\nthe price offered it was obvious the person tried to seem threatening in order\nto get the price down. Your price range was clearly listed on the website and\n10 million was pathetic\u2026</p><p>If they emailed your work email you\ncould respond with the price range there, you refused to take it via your\nprivate email and the fact that they had the audacity to find your private\naddress and email it already had them in some dangerous waters.</p><p>Maybe you came off as na\u00efve but the\npeople knew who they were dealing with when they sent this\u2026 you were\nprofessional assassinators, dangerous people.</p><p>A threatening response would have any\nunserious requester to grow immensely paranoid.</p><p>You could take care of this tomorrow\nwhen you would go back to the office, today was a day off after all. You\nswitched off the computer with a determined move and leaned back on the chair.</p><p>A brief moment later the door carefully\npushed open and Taehyung peaked in, dressed only in a towel wrapped snug around\nhis hips.</p><p>\u201cBabe can you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course honey!\u201d You got up from the\nchair and walked over to him by the door.</p><p>He held out his hand with a dainty chain\nhanging over his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to lock it three times now\nbut I give up.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the chain bracelet and\nhelped him put it on and thus the email was forgotten.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He smiled cutely and walked\nback towards your bedroom with you following him.</p><p>\u201cOh? Are you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to watch me get dressed?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was actually going to go downstairs\nbut since you\u2019re offering a show\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reverse strip tease, watch me get\ndressed.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>You took a seat on the neatly made bed\nand watched him as he walked over to the large closet.</p><p>He assembled an outfit and carried the\npile of clothes back out into the bedroom and placed it down next to you.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks good.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the towel loose and allowed it\nto fall from his hips, exposing him and acted like nothing.</p><p>You admired the view and he grabbed the\nwhite knitted sweater he had selected and pulled it over his head. He bent over\nslightly and put on a pair of boxers and finished off with black fitted jeans.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The day turned out to be quite the\ndomestic one. You went grocery shopping, snuggled with some Netflix, cooked\ndinner and just enjoyed a calm day together with each other\u2019s company. The calm\ndown time you had always managed to remind you of how much you really loved\nthis man.</p><p>To be honest your job was quite\nstressful and could be a source of anxiousness at times.</p><p>The real question was how long the two\nof you would keep this on? For sure you couldn\u2019t be hitmen for the rest of your\nlives\u2026 what if you had kids one day? Mummy and daddy couldn\u2019t go around killing\npeople and burning expensive shoes then, what type of role models would that\nmake you?</p><p>You had plenty of money to never have to\nworry, more than so and despite living together and sharing your life, Taehyung\nstill paid you generously. You did a job after all but it felt odd at times\nsince he tended to swipe his card for you more than necessary either way.</p><p>The discussion about it was pointless\nbecause he wouldn\u2019t listen\u2026</p><p>His warm breathe suddenly tickled your\nneck.</p><p>You were seated on the large white\nliving room sofa in front of the TV downstairs. His hand stroked up and down\nyour thigh and his lips pressed softly against your neck.</p><p>With a low smacking sound he sucked at\nyour skin, leaving a kiss in between every once in a while. His hand grabbed\nyour and placed it against his bulge and you palmed him gently, making him hum\nin pleasure against your neck.</p><p>Before you knew it his lips found yours\nand you were hungrily kissing each other.</p><p>Your hand rubbed against his growing\nbulge harder and you felt yourself grow needy by the mere second.</p><p>Taehyung began to get up from the sofa\nwithout breaking the kiss and with a swift move he lifted you up into his arms\nbridal style.</p><p>He broke the kiss and carried you\ntowards the stairs.</p><p>There was something deviant about his\nsmirk\u2026</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for my revenge baby.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>He carefully put you back down on your\nfeet in the bedroom and grabbed the hem of his sweater and pulled it up over\nhis head, throwing it to the floor.</p><p>\u201cStrip.\u201d He ordered, dragging a finger\nunder your chin.</p><p>His hands grabbed his belt buckle and\nbegan to undo it while he watched you with an intense glare.</p><p>You grabbed the hem of your own sweater\nand pulled it over your head.</p><p>You wanted to kiss him and have you pull\nyour clothes off each other but you didn\u2019t dare disobey him quite yet\u2026</p><p>You unhooked your bra and let it fall\ndown your arms and on to the floor.</p><p>He unzipped his jeans.</p><p>You wore a pair of black work out\nleggings and hooked your thumbs under the hem, pulling them down over your hips\nslowly along with your underwear.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>His jeans were off and he reached into\nhis boxers to free his erection before letting the remaining piece of fabric\nfall down his toned thighs.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees.\u201d He ordered, once\nyou were fully naked.</p><p>You followed his lead and got down on\nyour knees, looking up at him with an anticipated smirk.</p><p>He took a few steps closer and tangled a\nhand in your hair.</p><p>\u201cSuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t try any tricks.\u201d</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the base of\nhis shaft and took him into your mouth, pressing your tongue against the faint\nveins and sucking passionately.</p><p>He licked his lips, looking down at you\nwith a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth does wonders to me baby.\u201d He\npraised, scratching your head soothingly and pushing you a bit deeper.</p><p>\u201cI know you can take a bit more.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head back and moaned\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cJust like that baby, you know how I\nlike it\u2026\u201d</p><p>You failed to see how this was his\nrevenge\u2026 you enjoyed sucking him off\u2026 especially when it came with countless of\npraise.</p><p>He cupped your face with his large hands\nand took a step back, slipping out of your mouth with a string of saliva\nfollowing.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed, all fours.\u201d</p><p>He helped you up and you climbed up on\nthe large bed as he watched.</p><p>His hand caressed your ass gently.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what I\u2019m about to do to your\nbaby\u2026 but I warned you.\u201d</p><p>Following his words was a loud slap\nsound and a stinging sensation against your right butt cheek.</p><p>You felt your wetness almost leak down\nyour slit from the masochistic pleasure it gave you afterwards.</p><p>He spanked you a second time before\ngetting up on the bed himself.</p><p>Without warning he slipped two of his\nfingers into you and curled, tugging against your muscles teasingly.</p><p>\u201cAlready so wet\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pulled his fingers out and let them\nslide down your slit to your clit and brushed against it teasingly, making you\neven more aroused and wet.</p><p>\u201cGet on your back, I want to see your\nexpression when I touch you.\u201d</p><p>You did as told.</p><p>\u201cSo obedient\u2026 afraid of what I\u2019ll do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d He said pushed your\nthighs apart wide.</p><p>He leaned forward and licked up your\nslit and over your sensitive clit. He thrusted his fingers back into you and\npushed against your inner muscles roughly as his tongue licked across and\naround your clit repeatedly.</p><p>He groaned, sending a gentle vibration\nthrough you and making it all worse.</p><p>You inhaled sharply and failed to hinder\nyour moans much longer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear\u2026\u201d He\nwhispered, followed by a light chuckle.</p><p>He curled his fingers faster, brushing\nagainst your sweet spot and sending you close to an orgasm. Your thighs tensed\nup and your juices were coating his fingers generously.</p><p>You moaned his name, pleading as his\ntongue caressed your clit once more; making you curl your toes before his touch\nabruptly abandoned you.</p><p>He licked his lips and fingers, looking\ndown at you with the most deviant of smirks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s aches, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stroked your thighs soothingly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>You blushed.</p><p>\u201cI could kiss every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand against the bed on\neither side of you and leaned down over you and kissed your right nipple.</p><p>He trailed his kisses between your\nbreasts to the other nipple and latched on to it, sucking roughly and making it\nhard.</p><p>His lips released your nipple delicately\nand he moved back down to between your thighs. His hand gripped them firmly as\nhis tongue licked up your slit again, hitting at your clit and making you\nsquirm from the sensitive tingle, he thrusted his tongue against your entrance,\npushing past with ease and giving you a need to cry out at the teasing feeling.</p><p>The pressure of his tongue so near your\nentrance made you desperate for something to penetrate you deeper. The second\nyou grabbed his hair he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cNo baby, behave. I know you\u2019re eager\nbut I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a hold of his cock and moved\ncloser to you. He dragged the tip up and down your slit, brushing against your\nclit with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cHow bad do you want me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pushed the tip against your entrance,\nsliding in with the head of his cock, making you moan and pulled out.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d He teased and repeated the\nmove, making your juices leak.</p><p>He chuckled and climbed on top of you.</p><p>Without warning, he thrusted his thick\ncock into you all the way with an aggressive grunt.</p><p>You head fell back and you screamed out\nin pleasure at the filling and stretching sensation.</p><p>He pulled out almost entire before\nburying himself deep again with another groan.</p><p>His hands squeezed your waist and he\nplaced lazy kisses on your neck and chest as he picked up a fast pace, pounding\ndeep and hard.</p><p>His breath grew short quickly and he\nknew these short fast and deep thrusts would send you near the edge fast. He\nknew your body well\u2026 almost too well.</p><p>The numb feeling came running fast and\nyou grabbed on to the sheets tightly, struggling against your breath and need\nto moan.</p><p>Taehyung pulled out completely, leaving\nyour core with a pulsating ache. You tried to clench your thighs but he held\nthem apart with his hips pressed tight against your crotch.</p><p>\u201cOh no\u2026 were you close baby?\u201d he pouted\nand chuckled.</p><p>He reached down between you bodies and\npositioned the tip of his cock by your entrance again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to thrust back in baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven saying please? You\u2019re really\nobedient\u2026 maybe I should-\u201c</p><p>He inserted the head.</p><p>\u201cReward you?\u201d</p><p>You clenched tightly around the little\nhe gave you.</p><p>\u201cIs it not enough?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cThen beg baby.\u201d He said in a serious\ntone.</p><p>\u201cPlease honey, I want you deeper.\u201d</p><p>He slipped in slightly further.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Please! I need you so bad!\u201d You\nhit the bed, frustrated.</p><p>He snapped his hips against you,\nthrusting in hard and making you moan loud.</p><p>He picked up his pace again and fucked\nyou hard.</p><p>It was harder for him to hold back, his\nrelease coming closer sooner than he wanted it to.</p><p>\u201cFuck it.\u201d He mumbled and pounded into\nyou harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really close to cum for you baby,\nare you ready?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to take my load?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>With each thrust he left out a soft moan\nand they quickly turned into load whimpers and groans as he moved his hips with\nmore force, pounding deeper and harder with straining grunts, chasing the final\nsteps to his edge.</p><p>The tight knot in your core was\nunbearable and you couldn\u2019t wait much longer for him to send you into your\ndesired and immensely craved for orgasm.</p><p>He pulled out without warning, leaving\nyou with the absolute worst of aching feelings.</p><p>He\ncrashed his lips against yours and reached down to jerk himself off until he\nsquirted his cum out on your abdomen.</p><p>\u201dHow\ndoes that feel baby? Huh? Does it feel good princess? Did you want that? All my\ncum on your precious body? Or did you want my cock to cum in your pretty pussy\ninstead? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201dNow\nbeg for me to make you cum princess, beg for my cock to fuck you hard, beg me\nto break you and stretch your tight pussy out and fill it with my cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201dHow\nare you so dirty mouthed?\u201d You panted.</p><p>\u201dInspired\nby you. Now beg.\u201d</p><p>He\nmoved down and sat on his knees.</p><p>\u201dTell me how much you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how much you want me and I\u2019ll let you have\nyour orgasm sweetie, if you\u2019re a really good girl I\u2019ll give you my second\nload.\u201d</p><p>He jerked himself off roughly, breathing heavily. A\nwhimper escaped his throat and you could tell he was overstimulated. The tip of\nhis cock was blushed a deep pink.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d </p><p>He raised a brow, waiting for your pleading words.\nWith his free hand he pressed his thumb firmly against your clit.</p><p>\u201cWorry about yourself and beg.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed against your clit, driving you insane from\nthe smallest touch.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung please! Ah-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! But you\u2019re going to make me cum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>He moved his thumb faster and you cried out.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung please! I- I need you\u2026 I want you\u2026 I want\nyou so bad baby!\u201d You whimpered.</p><p>He bit his lip hard, loving the words and whimpers\npouring from your lips.</p><p>He let go of his cock, grabbed your ankles and pulled\nyou down closer to him before climbing on top of you and thrusting his cock\nback into you hard with a loud whimper.</p><p>The filling sensation after the torture of his thumb\nimmediately sent you dangerously close. He thrusted faster and harder, fighting\nagainst the overstimulated pain and praying for a second release. He was\nsacrificing himself.</p><p>You scratched your nails down his back and with a\nfinal hard thrust your muscles tensed up hard around his cock and let go of you\nwith an aching pulsating sensation and a wave of relief. You moaned loudly, out\nof breath.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You panted, knocked out.</p><p>He winced and hid his face in the crook of your neck\nand shoulder and with a shaky exhale he released a second load of cum,\ncollapsing on top of you, a panting mess.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You switched on the computer in your office and Taehyung\nwas busy opening the large safe out in his office as you arrived.</p><p>You had just remembered the email from yesterday and\nexpected to see something from the same odd looking address in your business\ninbox.</p><p>An accurate expectation indeed\u2026</p><p>You clicked open the email, expecting to see the same\noffer, but what you read made you gasp, causing Taehyung to run into your\noffice, finding you with your hand over your mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked concerned and ran to your\nside to see your screen, placing a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>-No subject-</p><p>\u201c10 million.</p><p>You ignored my previous email, now I won\u2019t be as nice.</p><p>I know who you are.\u201d</p><p>Attached was a map showing the location of your house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending this to you because I\u2019m offering you 10\nmillion to assassinate Kim Taehyung.</p><p>Or else I will.</p><p>x\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Can you track the IP back?\u201d</p><p>Your hands were shaking as you typed at the computer\nand Taehyung noticed and grabbed your hand and crouched down by your side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ok?\u201d he kissed it and let go.</p><p>You got up the IP but it showed a public library\u2026</p><p>\u201cThey sent an email to my private email address\nyesterday asking for a kill for ten but they never said of who and I\nimmediately blocked them.\u201d You confessed.</p><p>\u201cYour private one?!\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stood up with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it recently but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this, start another business\u2026 with fewer risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had the same thought\u2026 we can\u2019t do this forever\nwhat if-\u201c You held back.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we had kids one day, what would they think of\nus?\u201d</p><p>Had he read your mind?</p><p>\u201cBut the threat\u2026 they know where we live Taehyung and\nthey want you dead!?\u201d You cried out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll move, burn it all and make sure they can\u2019t find\nus I- we can\u2019t contact the police\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t burn everything we want to hide Tae!

It would be\nfor the best if you lay low for now and didn\u2019t have any business email\navailable to contact. You walked out to listen to Taehyung\u2019s phone calls and\ntook a seat on his chair while he was seated on the edge of his desk, waiting\nanxiously for someone to pick up.</p><p>\u201cHey it\u2019s Tae.\u201d</p><p>He put on speaker phone so you could eavesdrop.</p><p>\u201cOh? Hey, hold on a second I\u2019m just going to go\nsomewhere more in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, shoot, how\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good, can you tell me everything you know and\nthe reason behind your last booking?\u201d Taehyung asked in a strict tone.</p><p>\u201cIs there an issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The voice on the other end sighed.</p><p>\u201cHe made meth, delivered to us regularly. He asked for\ncash upon request and failed to deliver our orders and I told him if you don\u2019t\nhand us the money back and give us our delayed orders it\u2019s over for you, I have\nmy own customers waiting for me and I was in a sticky situation with multiple\nof them, thus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he affiliated with anyone or a gang or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of, according to our background\nchecks he was a solo business man. But who knows. Why? If you\u2019re in trouble you\nknow I\u2019ll help out, you\u2019ve helped me countless times and I\u2019m forever in debt\nfor your loyalty, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, or well my lady who is listening too by the way,\njust got a request sent to kill me for 10 million.\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 million?\u201d The voice laughed.</p><p> \u201cThey know\nwhere we live, sent proof and they claimed if she doesn\u2019t do it, they will.\nTracking the IP gave us nothing and I need to find out who these idiots or\nidiot are or is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Tae don\u2019t worry, I say don\u2019t get home\nfirst of all because you never know. Forward everything you got and I\u2019ll have\nmy staff look at it more thoroughly ok? Maybe the IP doesn\u2019t give anything but\nif the device he used has a location on we can easily track where they\u2019ve been\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, we appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! You still have my email right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it.\u201d You whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk great, I\u2019ll update you as soon as they get\nanything form it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and placed the phone next to him on the\ndesk with a deep sigh.</p><p>You caressed his back soothingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we made a deal with them instead? Paid them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey clearly want me dead.\u201d Taehyung admitted,\nhanging his head low.</p><p>You pushed the chair back loudly, making him look up.\nYou felt anger bubble up within you, this wasn\u2019t fun, and you didn\u2019t want to\nsee him hang his head down in defeat this early on. </p><p>Your hands cupped his cheeks and you looked deeply\ninto his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBaby listen, nothing is going to happen to you, or us\non my watch. Whoever this is they\u2019re digging their own grave right now because\nthey\u2019re not going to get what they want and they\u2019re not getting away with their\nattempts even if that means I personally have to kill them.\u201d</p><p>You kissed his lips softly.</p><p>\u201cOk?\u201d You tilted your head to the side with a smile.</p><p>He nodded slowly, looking away from your gaze.</p><p>\u201cNow forward the email you got to me and I\u2019ll forward\nthem all together onwards.\u201d You ordered, patting his cheek lightly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you so calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified, but that won\u2019t solve anything.\u201d </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You forwarded everything you had to Taehyung\u2019s contact\na while ago and ever since the phone call Taehyung had been oddly silent and\nwithdrawn, deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d He answered each time you asked if he was\nalright. How he acted only made you worry more and more and eventually you\nconvinced him to go out and grab something to eat with you. Maybe some energy\nwould lighten him or you could hopefully distract him until your contact had\nany news or updates for you.</p><p>The two of you ended up going home instead and\nbringing take out with you back.</p><p>At the table Taehyung poked at his food while you ate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2026\u201d He started.</p><p>\u201cI can tell, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what we- or well I should do\ninstead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling people for a living.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t comment on it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d He confessed,\nsitting back straight.</p><p>\u201cBefore anything worse happens\u2026 I just think this is a\nsign that we should stop doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just stop, we don\u2019t need to do anything until\nwe figure something out babe. It\u2019s going to be ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I had something in mind ever since you\ntold me about that dream you had long ago\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with the diamonds&hellip; Ever since you mentioned\nit I actually bought a few\u2026 and I sold one last week, as a test\u2026 and I sold it\nat the double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe double?\u201d</p><p>He nodded shyly, yet proudly.</p><p>\u201cI might have rounded up the karat amount a bit\u2026 but\nthe double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble cash or with tax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the table of course\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho bought it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSome dude from Russia, I don\u2019t know. He sent me the\nmoney and I shipped the diamond off express delivery, declared it as glass and\nthat was it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 How much was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c156 million us dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I tried to make it look like we were situated\nin America also as a test and it seemingly worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t he see where it was shipped from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI printed my own customs label and just edited the\naddress to the amazon warehouse as sender, it was easy and people don\u2019t care\nthey just handle it and send it onwards.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI can buy you the biggest house, which ever you\nwant.\u201d He smirked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying half of it, no discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You held you finger up to silence him.</p><p>\u201cBut we need a new house yes\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we look right now? Just for fun?\u201d He asked\neagerly.</p><p>You were relieved that he was in a better mood from\ntelling you about the sudden diamond trading experiment.</p><p>\u201cEat up first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get my laptop we can eat at the same time.\u201d\nHe said and ran out of the kitchen towards the stairs.</p><p>Buying expensive stuff\u2026 a solid distraction.</p><p>Taehyung left his phone on the kitchen counter and it\nsuddenly rang.</p><p>You grabbed it and saw it was your contact and\nimmediately answered for him with your name followed by \u201cthis is Taehyung\u2019s\nphone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I haven\u2019t spoken to you in ages! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, how are you?\u201d You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAll good, say it\u2019s late why are you still at work? Is\nTaehyung keeping you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 \u00a0we live\ntogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is news! But speaking of news I have some\nupdates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my staff found out that he knew the last guy we\ncalled for, he was his right hand in the business and they were close we\nspeculate. Either way he\u2019s about the same age and we also speculate since the\nheist was made to look like a suicide the police probably confiscated the meth\nlab which obviously would be a an inconvenience for him. What we can see too he\nseems to know what he\u2019s doing with computers and hacking, how on earth he found\nout about you is astonishing\u2026 he must have known about us and hacked us and\nfound out that way and if the fault is on us I can\u2019t do anything but deeply\napologize to both of you and offer anything we can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who he is? Or where he lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a name but no address yet unfortunately,\nwe\u2019re working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeon Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung returned to the kitchen with his laptop in\nhis arms. By the site of you with his phone by his ear his smile fell back into\nthe worrying pout.</p><p>You lowered the phone from your ear and put on speaker\nphone.</p><p>\u201cCan you call us when you find out more about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe you.\u201d</p><p>You hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cThey know who it is, but they\u2019re still trying to find\nhis whereabouts and when they do\u2026. It\u2019s over for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe final kill\u2026\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>Taehyung put the laptop down on the counter and took a\nseat before switching it on.</p><p>\u201cOur priority now is getting us in safety, so let\u2019s\nfind a house\u2026 or something temporary we can get on short notice until we get a\nproper new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d You said and took another bite of your\nfood.</p><p>\u201cAny special requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen space and big windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and in a secluded area with guards and 24 hours\nsecurity.\u201d He added.</p><p>Buying a house on short notice maybe wasn\u2019t that easy\nbut when you were able to pay upfront in cash\u2026 you were any real estate agent\u2019s\ndream.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Fast forward it was easier said than done to find a\nhouse without looking at it and you instead opted for temporarily settling at\nthe suite of a hotel until you found something that suited you. After a few\ncalls you had a real estate agent that could assist you on short notice and\nshow you around a few properties in the upcoming days.</p><p>You still hadn\u2019t heard back from your contact\nregarding Jungkook and the little research you attempted to do yourself hadn\u2019t\ngiven much. You knew your codes and IP disguises but beyond that your hacking\nskills were fairly limited and the people your contact had were professionals.</p><p>All you could do was wait, trust and be on your guard.</p><p>In the given moment you were resting against\nTaehyung\u2019s bare chest in the large bed of the hotel suite after haven eaten\nsome room service food you\u2019d called for\u2026 and then having sex.</p><p>In all honesty it was something you needed more than\nyou thought. To destress and get everything out of you to clear your mind and\nspike your mood back.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s fingers drew lazy spirals up and down your\narm as you both calmed down and you couldn\u2019t help but admire his hand as it\nmoved slowly across your skin.</p><p>\u201cYou always wear such nice rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d He said, stopping the circles and holding\nout up his hands to look for himself at the dainty jewelry decorating his long\nfingers.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cEach ring has a sentimental meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognize this one.\u201d You pointed towards his ring\nfinger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you picked it, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, it\u2019s for 100<sup>th</sup> kill\u2026 I asked you to\npick something and you choose this ring.\u201d</p><p>The memory returned to you.</p><p>It was indeed long ago and you were in a jewelry\nstore. Back then he was colder and his told you to pick out a ring for him\nbecause he \u201cCouldn\u2019t be bothered to\u201d, you didn\u2019t know what for at the time and\nonly did as you were told.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to pick it because it felt special\u2026 but\nI was dumb enough to not say anything, but I was too shy to\u2026 and since you\u2019d\nhelped me so many times I wanted you to be a part of it in some way\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet.\u201d You giggled and traced across the\nrings with your fingertips, feeling the surface of the dainty silver.</p><p>\u201cI should get rid of it though\u2026 once we\u2019re done I\u2019m\nnever going to assassinate for anyone ever again and then I\u2019m going to throw it\naway.\u201d His voice sounded determined. </p><p>He squished you closer against his body briefly as he\nreached for his hand with his other to pull the ring off and to your surprise he\ntossed it across the room.</p><p>The silver clinked loudly as it hit the wooden floor\nand rolled away across the room.</p><p>\u201cI want to wear something else on this finger anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever get married one day, I\u2019ll need this finger\nin particular.\u201d</p><p>Your cheeks were burning from his words and you hid\nyour face against his chest. </p><p>He laughed softly at your reaction and patted your\nback.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026 Are you tired? Why are you hiding from me?\u201d He\nteased.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sleep time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d He giggled and moved his hand to your\nwaist to tickle you.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung stop!\u201d You laughed, squirming and trying to\nget away from his hand by climbing over him. A dumb choice and a fortunate\nmistake in once.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you\ndown, rolling on top of you and crashing his lips against your neck and\ncontinued to tickle your waist.</p><p>Your cheekbones were aching from the laughing and he\nfinally stopped. Instead he moved his lips from your necks to yours and kissed\nyou slowly and passionately, sliding his hands further up your sides.</p><p>It had almost a soothing effect on you the way he\nslowly caressed your lips with his own.</p><p>After a short while he pulled away and nuzzled your\nneck.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You shook the hand of the real estate agents and said\nyour goodbyes after being shown around multiple properties and quite a few that\ncaught your liking. You were handed a pile of papers of each property to look\nover in private before making any further decisions and you eagerly received\nthem.</p><p>In the car on your way back to the hotel your phone\ndinged, as it would\u2026 but this was a text from and unknown number\u2026</p><p>You could feel your heart sink.</p><p>\u201cYou have 24 hours.\u201d</p><p>You immediately forwarded it to your contact.</p><p>\u201cI just got a text and it says I have 24 hours\u2026 I\nthink it\u2019s from him.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung suddenly hit the brakes hard and did a\ndrastic U-turn.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I should\u2019ve gotten rid of our phones!\u201d He\ngroaned and hit the wheel.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving us a lead to him at least, I forwarded\nit already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking any more risks. The second they find\nhim we get on the next plane back and I\u2019m fucking killing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack from where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever flight has seats available, we\u2019re leaving\nthe country either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am! Turn your phone off!\u201d</p><p>With one hand on the wheel he grabbed his own out of\nhis pocket and handed it to you.</p><p>\u201cTurn it off too and throw them out of the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust throw them out!\u201d</p><p>You turned his phone off and rolled down the window\nand tossed them out on the side of the highway hard, smashing them both.</p><p>Adrenaline began to take over and Taehyung stepped on\nthe gas harder.</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to call us now if they find him\nTaehyung!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck! Maybe they have computers we could borrow or an\ninternet caf\u00e9 at the airport, anything!? We can send them and email? I didn\u2019t\nthink about that, fuck I\u2019m so dumb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it either until it was too late,\nthere\u2019s nothing we can do about it anyway. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>He left the highway at the exit leading towards the\nairport and parked the car at the first available spot.</p><p>The two of your rushed in and luckily found a hotspot\narea with computers and you quickly logged onto your email while Taehyung\nfrantically searched for tickets to purchase.</p><p>\u201cOur phones are out of order, please contact us on\nthis email as soon as you can!\u201d You sent.</p><p>\u201cPlease respond fast.\u201d You begged.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a flight to Vienna in four hours. Should I\nbook it?\u201d Taehyung asked, clearly distressed judging by the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s- Let\u2019s just wait five minutes in case he\nresponds and calm down, ok?\u201d</p><p>Five minutes felt like an hour and you impatiently\nrefreshed the page and to your relief you saw a response.</p><p>\u201cI just tried to call you. We tracked the location of\nthe text and it came from your house.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked over at your screen and read the email\nover and over again.</p><p>\u201cHow did he make it past the security gates? There are\nguards!\u201d</p><p>You exchanged brief eye contact with each other.</p><p>Vienna or going back and hoping he\u2019d still be there?</p><p>Taehyung leaned over to your side and clicked down the\nbrowser on the computer, stood up, grabbed your hand and ran back towards the\ncar, dragging you along.</p><p>The choice was made.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>\u201cHe could be waiting for us.\u201d Taehyung said, speeding.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gun hidden in the trunk, just in case; we\u2019ll\nuse that and end it once and for all.\u201d</p><p>You reached your neighborhood in no time and used your\nkey card to open the gate.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the guard?\u201d You questioned, looking\nout of the window.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stopped the car as the gate closed behind and\nquickly ran out to grab the gun from the trunk and took his seat behind the\nwheel again.</p><p>Everything seemed normal, even the atmosphere and no\ncar was parked near you house or on your driveway. The only car in sight was\nthe car parked in your neighbor\u2019s driveway.</p><p>Even the door to your house was locked.</p><p>Maybe he had just left? Or just roamed around the\noutside?</p><p>\u201cThis feels really weird\u2026\u201d Taehyung said in a low\nvoice, keeping you close by his arm around your waist.</p><p>He unlocked the door and pushed it open carefully.</p><p>Everything was still intact\u2026</p><p>But he had clearly been here? At least according to\nthe position of his location unless he had it hidden but then how on earth\nwould it show your house?</p><p>Nothing made sense!</p><p>You looked around the first level and Taehyung stopped\nyou by the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWait down here and I\u2019ll look upstairs.\u201d He handed you\nhis gun but you refused to take it.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you need it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re after you, not me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the gun.\u201d He said in a strict threatening tone.</p><p>The odd feeling came crawling and you felt more and\nmore of a bugging gut feeling.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d You said and ran out into the kitchen to grab\na knife.</p><p>\u201cAt least take this.\u201d</p><p>He took the knife from you and began walking upstairs.</p><p>Should you check the basement while he checked\nupstairs or stay?</p><p>The best would be if you had each other backs but he\nwas being so stubborn.</p><p>You looked around the living room. It was familiar to\nthe sight but unfamiliar to the feeling\u2026</p><p>The gun was held tight in your hands, unloaded as you\nwalked around the large space.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here\u2026 he\u2019s upstairs. Come out so we can\ntalk.\u201d You whispered and loaded your gun.</p><p>\u201cHow could you tell I was here honey?\u201d A voice\nsuddenly whispered, making you jump. You slapped your hand over your mouth to\nnot scream as you quickly turned around and spotted a dark dressed tall young\nman approaching you from his hiding.</p><p>His hair was short and black and he was strongly\nbuilt, if it wasn\u2019t for that he had threatened to kill the love of your life\nyou would\u2019ve admitted to him being attractive.</p><p>\u201cAre you Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>You aimed your gun at his forehead.</p><p>He scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI expected you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a few steps closer, clearly not intimidated by\nthe gun.</p><p>\u201cSay how much do you know about chemistry?\u201d He asked,\ntilting his head to the side and reaching into his pocket.</p><p>You took a step back.</p><p>What type of question was that?</p><p>Should you just shoot? Call out for Taehyung? For some\nreason your mind couldn\u2019t make a decision and Jungkook took yet another step\ncloser to you.</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to go with plan B.\u201d He muttered and\npulled out a cloth from his pocket.</p><p>He was too fast.</p><p>He grabbed the gun and aimed it away from him with\nstrong force and kicked your leg, tackling you to the ground with a loud sound,\nloud enough to alert Taehyung that something had happened. But before you knew\nit the room turned foggy and you lost consciousness.</p><p>The cloth was drenched in a strong odor, whatever it\nwas made you black out and within seconds Jungkook had your thrown over his\nshoulder and ran out to the car he had parked in the neighbor\u2019s driveway.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You woke up in a seated position, feeling drowsy to\nsay the least.</p><p>Heavy chains were holding you in place against the\nchair.</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re awake.\u201d </p><p>Not the voice you wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some water?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>The room was dark and you could tell where Jungkook was\nstanding but not much else.</p><p>Where were you?</p><p>You blinked a few times and your vision gradually\nbecame clearer.</p><p>It was a basement, clearly.

You\nwhipped a tear away with your thumb and he looked into your eyes deeply before\nyou attacked his lips, giving him relief and reassurance.</p><p>He unbuckled his belt so he\ncould get closer and wrapped and arm around you and tangled the other in your\nhair, making sure you wouldn\u2019t pull away for however long he needed you.</p><p>He was calming down and his\nhand in your hair fell to your cheek instead, stroking over your skin softly.\nYour lips parted and he pressed his forehead against yours, catching his breath.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had to quit\nbecause my feelings for you were growing too strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just confess\nto me? I\u2019ve been hurting so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I was too afraid to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy sweetie? I\u2019ve done\neverything my confidence let me to hint to you how important you are for me,\nall the times I\u2019ve held your hand when we\u2019ve run away, when I protect you\u2026 I\nprotect you because I love you.\u201d</p><p>It was getting hard to hold\nback the tears now.</p><p>\u201cAm I dreaming now too?\u201d You\ncried.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is all real\nsweetie. Finally.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be.\u201d He kissed\nyour forehead. \u201cWe need each other, you and I.\u201d He moved your hair to behind\nyour ear.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d he asked\nbravely.</p><p>You hid your mouth behind\nyour hand and nodded, looking down.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He stroked your cheek again\nand you let go of each other. Taehyung put his seatbelt back on and returned to\nthe road carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you properly\nwhen we\u2019re back.\u201d He ensured.</p><p>The short ride remaining\nyour mind was pre-occupied replaying the scene you just experienced over and\nover again. The poison was even stronger than in the dream\u2026 You feelings were\nall over the place in a disorganized mess and all you knew was that you wanted\nhis touch back.</p><p>Taehyung parked the car\nbehind the building and got out, grabbed his bag from the back seat and the box\nfrom the trunk. You took the files with you and you walked towards the back\nentrance of the building. He put the box under his arm and grabbed your hand\nwith his free one.</p><p>Your heart was aching so bad\nit physically hurt.</p><p>Once you returned to the\noffice he put his bag down on the floor and the box as well and quickly walked\nover to his desk and knocked almost everything over.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He ordered and patted\nthe desk.</p><p>He grabbed the filed from\nyou and threw them on the floor, pushing you back to sit on his desk. He placed\nhis hands on your cheeks and stood between your thighs as he crashed his lips against\nyours and slipped his tongue in. Lust mixed with desperate desire.</p><p>His hands fell to your\nthighs and he leaned forward even closer, forcing you to wrap your arms around\nhim to not fall backwards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this for\nso long.\u201d He whispered between the heated kiss.</p><p>Your lust for him was\ngrowing stronger than ever and your hands grabbed onto his belt buckle, tugging\nat it and making you both open your eyes. Your lips parted, faces still closed\nand looking deeply into each other eyes.</p><p>He raised a brow in a\nquestioning expression.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d He asked,\nvoice low.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You confessed and\ncupped his cheek with your hand.</p><p>He moved fast.</p><p>Quickly unbuckled his belt\nand unzipped his jeans, pulling them down with a rough yanking motion along\nwith his boxer and freeing his dick. His hands slid up your thighs and moved\nyour dress up to your waist before he grabbed the sides of your panties and\npulled them down your legs.</p><p>His arms wrapped around your\nwaist and pulled you close and picked you up and he lied you down along the\nside of the desk on your back.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his\nhair.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have time?\u201d You\nasked, supporting yourself up on your elbow.</p><p>\u201cFor a quicky.\u201d</p><p>He hands grabbed your thigh\nand he bent down and without warning his lips touched your wetness and his\ntongue licked up your slit. He moved your thighs to his shoulders and held his\nbalance by holding on to the edge of the desk. You fell back against the hard\nwooden desk top and clenched your thighs tightly at the immense sensation he\nsent through you.</p><p>His lips sucked gently at\nyour clit before his tongue suddenly located you entrance and pushed through.\nIt didn\u2019t last long and he was hasty, he sucked gently at your clit and slipped\nin two fingers and thrusted them slowly.</p><p>\u201cI need to get you nice and\nwet first baby\u2026 I\u2019m quite thick.\u201d</p><p>His words were teasing all\nat its own.</p><p>\u201cI can take it! Please\njust-\u201c</p><p>He fingers left you and he\nstood back up properly, looking down at you with dark eyes.</p><p>He licked his fingers clean\nand placed his hands by your hips, moving them up along your outer thigh.</p><p>\u201cPut your legs over my\nshoulders.\u201d</p><p>You followed his lead and\nhis hands caressed your legs as he got closer.</p><p>You could feel hit tip\nbarely touching you until his hand guided himself between your slit.\nAnticipation mixed with need tortured you.</p><p>You moaned softly as you\nfelt his cock push through and stretch you out.</p><p>He bit his lower lip and\nslid in all the way.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d He\nsmirked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You chuckled almost a\nbit embarrassed, but you had to hurry up now.</p><p>He grip tightened and he\npulled back and thrusted back into you hard with a loud groan and picked up a\nfast pace.</p><p>\u201cNext time I promise this\nwill last for hours, I just want you so bad baby.\u201d He panted.</p><p>You grabbed on to the edges\nof the desk. He felt amazing and you didn\u2019t want it to ever end but you knew\nyou both had to release fast. </p><p>His hands fell to desk edge\nas well and he pushes your legs forward, going deeper and faster with heavy\ngrunts.</p><p>\u201cFuck! This is just like in\nmy dream.\u201d He moaned, followed by a sweet chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou dreamt of fucking me on\nyour desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm, but this is so much\nbetter baby.\u201d He thrusted hard and deep, making you let out a surprised\nwhimper.</p><p>\u201cTell me when you\u2019re close\nbaby.\u201d He urged.</p><p>You reached down with one\nhand to play with your clit to help yourself get there faster but Taehyung\u2019s\nrough speed was almost enough to set you off on its own.</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d You pleaded and bit\nyour lip.</p><p>\u201cFuck you look so sexy\u2026 I\ncan\u2019t wait to see you naked.\u201d He panted and placed a kiss against your leg.</p><p>He whimpered, now chasing\nhis own high as time ran shorter and shorter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum.\u201d He called\nout and thrusted even deeper.</p><p>Your muscles were crying out\nfor relief through numb tingles and you rubbed your clit faster to catch up\nwith him and it got harder and harder to breathe properly and eventually you\njust held on to your own breath as you expected to break at any moment.</p><p>With a deep exhale mixed\nwith the tones of his sweet voice moaning out in pleasure you could feel him\nrelease his cum inside you as you climaxed. You core pulsated tightly and\nbefore you knew it he abruptly pulled out and pushed your legs off his shoulder\nand almost climbed up on the desk just to kiss you. You pushed yourself up to\nsitting to catch his need for kissing you and your lips crashed.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around\nyou and lifted you up to standing. Your legs were still shaken and weak and you\nlost your ability to stand and caught yourself by wrapping your arms around his\nneck, still not breaking the kiss.</p><p>A trail of his cum leaked\ndown your inner thigh.</p><p>Once you regained control\nover your legs you broke the kiss and quickly reached for your underwear to put\nthem back on while Taehyung did up his jeans and belt again. You pulled your\ndress back down over your hips and thighs and grabbed a tissue from the box on\nyour desk in your office and quickly whipped your thigh clean of his release.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d You called out,\nlooking at the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung unlocked his safe\nand handed you your gun and grabbed his own.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the strap.\u201d He said\nand tossed it to you.</p><p>You placed your gun on his\ndesk and quickly tied the strap around your thigh and attached the gun to it,\nthrowing the fabric of the dress down to conceal it.</p><p>You gathered together the\nfiles.</p><p>Taehyung hid his gun by his\nbelt and threw his long coat back on before grabbing yours and your hand and\nrunning out of the building.</p><p>\u201cHere, it\u2019s cold, don\u2019t get\nsick.\u201d He said and placed it over your shoulders for the short run to the car.</p><p>The stress was oddly\narousing and you finally took a seat in the car an hurried away towards your\nlocation.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cBrook Street then left.\u201d\nYou instructed, looking at the files.</p><p>Taehyung switched lanes and\nnoticed how you suddenly squirmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I can still feel\nyour cum leaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cLeft here. And just you\nwait till later\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me hard while\nI\u2019m driving, I don\u2019t want to show up with a throbbing erection.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you that sensitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you yeah. Now where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after this block.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You pulled up in a\nneighborhood of worn down looking houses. The entire block seemed to be in some\nserious need of restoration and renovation.</p><p>Your target lived in one of\nthe small apartment buildings and you quickly made your way over and inside.</p><p>\u201cThird floor, apartment\n1506\u201d you informed as you stepped inside the elevator.</p><p>This was an easy mission\ncompared to what you had have in past.</p><p>Sometimes, in worse cases\npeople had been expecting you and caused it to quickly turn ugly.</p><p>The elevator dinged and you\nand Taehyung stepped out on the third floor and found the right apartment.</p><p>Taehyung pulled his gun out\nand loaded it and hid against the wall right next to the door while you\nknocked.</p><p>It took a few knocking\nattempts until you finally heard someone approach the door from inside.</p><p>A large, annoyed looking man\nopened the door with sleepy eyes. Once he saw you he eyes you up and down in\nyour dress and open coat and looked confused but pleased.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a bathtub?\u201d You\nasked, trying to sound anxious.</p><p>\u201cI so happen to, how come?\u201d</p><p>The click from Taehyung\u2019s\ngun made him freeze as the gun was suddenly aimed at his head.</p><p>You smirked.</p><p>\u201cGet in the tub.\u201d Taehyung\nordered and you both back him inside and closed the door behind.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the tub.\u201d Taehyung\nsaid, more aggressive and poked the gun at his head.</p><p>As you entered the bathroom\nyou threw a quick glance into the apartment and saw the dirty looking at home\nlab in the living room. Did he create drugs of some sort?</p><p>It was none of your\nbusiness, you were here to do your job but it was always curious to know what\nthe causes of these hits were.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scaring me if\nthat\u2019s what you\u2019re here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d You ordered.</p><p>\u201cShut up bitch.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung lowered his gun and\nshot him in the foot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you say\nto her?\u201d</p><p>The man bent down in pain\nand screamed and you pushed him into the bathtub.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it personal.\u201d\nTaehyung threatened and aimed the gun at his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me!?\nI don\u2019t have anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of our\nbusiness, someone just sent us here to wish you good night that\u2019s all.\u201d You\nsmiled.</p><p>He looked confused and a\nsecond later Taehyung pulled the trigger.</p><p>The job was done.</p><p>You pulled out a zip lock\nbag from your bag with a gun and a note in it and Taehyung put on his black\nleather gloves that were in his coat pocket and secured his own gun at his belt\nagain.</p><p>He took the bag from you and\nmade sure to cover the gun with plenty of the man\u2019s own finger prints just as\nwith the note before placing the note in the sink and placing the gun in the\nman\u2019s hand.</p><p>He shoved the zip lock bag\nin his pocket, removed his gloves and grabbed your hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Making it look like\nsomething it wasn\u2019t was something you charged heavily extra for, but what the\nclient wants and pays for, the client gets.</p><p>You set the door to lock\nitself when you left and you got back to the car.</p><p>Taehyung opened the back\ntrunk and inside were two shoe boxes.</p><p>You lifted one of your legs\nup to take your shoe off but Taehyung stopped you.</p><p>\u201cHoney no, sit in the\nbackseat so you don\u2019t have to touch the ground.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t really mind but\nwent to open the back seat door anyway and took a seat sideways so your feet\nwere out of the car.</p><p>After each mission you had\nlike a tradition to always burn your shoes, the only pity was that the shoes\nyou burned were always so expensive. You once suggested for Taehyung that you\nshould get cheap shoes to wear for missions and burn but he refused.</p><p>You had dismissed the\nthought in the past that maybe he enjoyed buying you expensive shoes, and\nburning them was an excuse to buy more as well as wiping away your traces\u2026 but\nhe never said anything about it.</p><p>Before you had the chance to\nkick off your sparkly heels Taehyung rushed over to you and put the shoe box on\nyour lap and bent down. He grabbed your right ankle and slipped the shoe off\nand repeated the same move with your left.</p><p>You opened the box for him\nand to your surprise there were a pair of black Louboutin pumps inside.</p><p>\u201cI thought they\u2019ll look good\non you.\u201d He confessed shyly and took one on of the shoes.</p><p>\u201cAll shoes you pick do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and looked down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like them.\u201d</p><p>He slipped the shoe on and\nyou giggled, feeling almost like Cinderella.</p><p>Taehyung grabbed the other\nshoe and slipped it on as well.</p><p>\u201cAre they comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey feel good.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stood back up and\ngrabbed your old Jimmy Choo\u2019s and placed them in the box for you. You moved the\nbox off your lap and into the seat behind you and Taehyung held out a hand to\nhelp you up and out of the car.</p><p>They were beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI know you should never buy\nshoes for a love because the soles wear out, but they never get the chance to\nsince we burn them.\u201d He smiled proudly and closed the door behind him.</p><p>He quickly changed his own\nshoes, getting out of his shiny Dior shoes and into a brown pair of loafers.</p><p>\u201cGucci?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>He closed the trunk and you\nboth got back into the car.</p><p>\u201cWe have dinner left on our\nschedule.\u201d You pointed out once he started the car.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his wide smile\nthat had your heart melting.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a place in mind.\u201d He\nsaid mysteriously and tapped the screen display in the car to call.</p><p>The person that picked up\nvoiced a short hello.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>You took a short detour back\nto the office and picked up your things and the parcel from earlier before\nheading to dinner.</p><p>Taehyung drove a somewhat\nfamiliar route before stopping by a gate into a gated community of large lavish\nhouses.</p><p>You remembered very well\nthat Taehyung lived here.</p><p>In his backyard was a cozy\nfire pit and that\u2019s where you\u2019d burn your shoes.</p><p>\u201cAre we burning the shoes\nfirst?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to\u2026 We\u2019re\nhaving dinner at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to cook for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d You\nconfessed shyly.</p><p>This warm domestic side was\nsomething you would never get tired of seeing and now when he was finally\nyours\u2026 you could see his warm smile whenever, his heart finally at ease and\nburning with a new type of fire.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The sun was setting and\nTaehyung threw a few more logs into the fire followed by you tossing your shoes\ninto the fire. You reached down and picked his Diors up and tossed them into\nthe fire as well.</p><p>You had never really had the\nchance to properly explore his large house.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a house\ntour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never explored, I\u2019ve\nnever seen your room or the upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He looked surprised.</p><p>You pulled the blanket over\nyour shoulders tighter around you and nodded.</p><p>He put an arm around you and\nwalked you back inside through the large terrace doors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much too see but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI doubt it! I want to see\nyour closet too, you always dress so nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>You left the blanket on the\nsofa in the living room downstairs and ran up the stairs before Taehyung.</p><p>The first door led into a\nlarge master bedroom with a huge bed made neatly with decorative pillows.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but I never sleep in\nit.\u201d Taehyung said, catching up to you.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bed is too big. It\nmakes me feel lonely.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him with\npitiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d say that.\u201d He\nleaned in and kissed you softly.</p><p>You could say that\u2019s where\nit all started a few months ago\u2026</p><p>When everything finally\nchanged.</p><p>Oh yeah, the package!</p><p>It did contain diamonds like\nhe said\u2026 but in form of a dainty choker, made for you.</p><p>The entire piece was lined\nwith tiny diamonds and you didn\u2019t dare consider what it could possibly be\nworth. Another of his expensive gifts in a desperate attempt to charm you, when\nhe had already been successful in doing so\u2026</p><p>\u2013</p><p>His sleepy\nvoice was deep and raspy, making you almost shiver when he whispered in your\near.</p><p>Taehyung\nwas cuddled up tightly against your body from behind, spooning you with a\nstrong arm wrapped snug around your waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d\nHe pouted and nuzzled the back of your neck gently.</p><p>\u201cPut\nsomething on.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be a\nlot warmer if he just wore pajamas instead of getting right into bed fully\nnude\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d </p><p>You giggled\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cThen\nyou\u2019ll have to hug me harder.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed\nyou and you made a playful suffocating sound, making him chuckle.</p><p>He hummed\nsoftly and his grip loosened and he placed his hand on your hip, by the hem of\nyou pajama shorts.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nwhat I mean.\u201d He whispered, sounding pleading.</p><p>He pulled\nyour shorts down over your hip slowly and of course you had suspected his hint\neven before that but it was fun to play games with his needs sometimes.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d\nhis tone was sultry and you bit your lip as he continued sliding your shorts\ndown your thighs.</p><p>You hummed\na yes and kicked your shorts of the remaining way under the covers and Taehyung\nmoved even closer, pressing his hips against your butt. He quickly reached over\nyou for the tiny bottle of lube conveniently placed on your nightstand table\nand coated his cock with a few drops before throwing the bottle on the floor.\nHe pulled you back by the hips, positioning you in a pose that would make it\neasier for him to slide in.</p><p>The covers\nruffled softly from all the movement and suddenly you felt the tip of his cock\ndrag between your lower lips before pushing through. He let out a short low\ngroan and positioned himself by your entrance before thrusting into you\ncarefully. His thickness stretched you out slightly and the position you were\nin with your thighs clenched together made it feel like an even tighter fit.</p><p>He pushed\nin deep and pulled you back even more to take more of his cock. His arm\nreturned to your waist and he exhaled deeply with a soft moan and rested his\nhead against the pillow; his deep breathing tickled the back of your neck and\neventually you drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Having his\ncock inside you like that was something you both loved. In some way it was cozy\nand comfortable, but an intimate version of being so. Softly clenching around\nhim and feeling yourself get almost incredibly wet from just his still presence\nwas amazing. Sometimes the two of you grew so horny it just became impossible\nto feel asleep that way and you ended up fucking instead and then passing out\nto sleep from exhaustion; Also a great outcome.</p><p>The worst\npart for both of you was when he had to pull out or if he accidently slipped\nout during your sleep. At one time he had cum in his sleep from a dream and\nwhen he pulled out a trail of his cum leaked down your thighs.</p><p>You thought\nit was funny, but Taehyung was embarrassed.</p><p>The last\nthing you felt before falling asleep were his soft lips pressing delicately\nagainst your neck, giving you a gentle kiss good night.</p><p>You moved in with him not\ntoo long ago and you finally made use of his large comfortable bed for more\nthan just sleeping.</p><p>Your old penthouse apartment\nwas up for sale and you were glad you got the chance to invite Taehyung over to\nyour place a few times before he begged you to move in with him.</p><p>Well, a few might sounds\nless than it was but having him stay the night hugging you from behind, his\nnude skin against yours\u2026 was something you wouldn\u2019t give up for the world,\nespecially not after sex.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t get enough of\neach other.</p><p>Almost every night one of\nyou made the other scream out in pleasure.</p><p>There was no shame.</p><p>Some days you\u2019d wake him up\nunder the sheets by sucking him off and other days he\u2019d tickle your clit to\nwake you up and fuck you before breakfast. There was no end to it. You lust for\neach other was stronger than any force.</p><p>The office, the car, every\nroom of the house\u2026 once even at the very end of a mission.</p><p>May that have been\ncontroversial\u2026 but something came over both of you that day while still wearing\nyour soon to be burned shoes\u2026</p><p>\u2013</p><p>That night you woke up\nbriefly by soft whimpers coming from your love behind you. His cock was on the\nvery edge of slipping out of your heat and it was a teasing sensation, you\nwanted him deep and right where he was, was dangerously close to one of your sweet\nspots. You wiggled your hips carefully and caused him to slip out fully for\nyour own relief and fell back to sleep.</p><p>A couple of hours later you\nwoke up first and carefully moved out of his hold to lie on your stomach beside\nhim to half-sleep until he would wake up.</p><p>He was breathing softly next\nto you and you couldn\u2019t help but admire this sleeping beauty.</p><p>He blinked a few times and finally woke\nup, stretching out his lean arms with a groan.<br>\nHe eyed you up and down as you lied on your stomach next to him and his tongue\nlicked across his lip. </p><p>\u201cNice view to wake up to.\u201d He said,\nadmiring your naked body with a smirk. </p><p>You smiled and leaned close to kiss his\nsoft lips good morning.<br>\n\u201cCome here baby.\u201d He begged and sat up, leaning against the head board with one\narm resting on top of it as he patted on his thigh for you to come sit.<br>\nYou moved your leg over and straddled him, his hands landing on your lower\nback, stroking up and down as you leaned closer to him. </p><p><br>\n\u201cWhat were you dreaming about?\u201d You asked.<br>\n\u201cOh\u2026 I don\u2019t remember.\u201d <br>\n\u201cYou were whimpering in your sleep.\u201d You teased, making him giggle in\nembarrassment.<br>\nHe pushed against your back, making you press tight against him so his mouth\nwas right by your ear.<br>\n\u201cI dreamt\u2026\u201d He whispered. \u201cThat I was fucking your tight little pussy with my\ncock\u2026 Hard\u2026 And you had your hands\u2026\u201d He grabbed your hands, placing them on his\nchest. \u201cHere\u2026 While I was pounding into you, making you scream for more than\nyou could handle.\u201d He nibbled at your earlobe gently.</p><p><br>\nHis story definitely tied a knot within you. <br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so needy for you baby\u2026\u201d He said sultry and twirled and strand of your hair.<br>\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that Mr. Kim.\u201d You grinned and looked down, seeing how his\nmorning wood had developed into a full hard erection, thick and likely\nthrobbing. <br>\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d He begged, biting down on his lip as his hand moved down to your\nbutt.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been such a good girl lately\u2026.\u201d<br>\nA good girl?<br>\nYou smirked and jumped off of him and got down from the bed.<br>\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked in a serious concerned tone.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m having a shower, what are you waiting for?\u201d You smirked and curled your\nfingers in a come here motion as you headed towards the bathroom.<br>\nYou heard the rustle of the sheets behind you and the sound of his feet\ntouching the floor.</p><p>You entered the bathroom, Taehyung\nfollowing behind and you stepped into the spacious rain shower together.</p><p><br>\nThe water started falling over the two of you.<br>\nTaehyung grabbed your hips and pressed himself close against your butt, his\ncock rubbing against you cheek.<br>\n\u201cBaby\u2026I want you so bad right now.\u201d He groaned. You pressed your butt against\nhim firmer, wanting to tease him.<br>\nGood girl? Tsk\u2026\u00a0</p><p><br>\nYou turned around and looked into his dark eyes filled with lust and his lips\nparted slightly. </p><p>His hands were already all over your\nbody, caressing and tracing your every curve.<br>\nYou placed a finger under his chin and pressed your lips against his. He\npressed you closer to his wet body and desperately tried to deepen the kiss,\nbut you wouldn\u2019t let him. </p><p>You bit down gently on his lip and\npulled away.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d He panted, leaning in to suck on your neck but you backed away.<br>\nHe stared at you intensely as you grabbed the shower gel and poured a generous\namount over your breasts and started to lather in your entire body.\u00a0<br>\nTaehyung leaned back against the tiles, his hand wrapped tight around his\nshaft. <br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201c he pleaded, eyes not leaving your body for a mere\nsecond.</p><p><br>\nYou let the soap wash off your body and continued moving your hands over your\nbody. You slipped your hand down between your folds and swirled a circle over\nyour clit.<br>\n\"Ah\u2026 Taehyung\u2026\u201d You moaned, knowing this would make him mad. </p><p>He didn\u2019t like it when you touched\nyourself, especially not when he was rock hard and needy for you.</p><p><br>\nJust a second later you were impatiently pushed against the cold tiles in the\nshower, your breasts squeezed against the wall and with Taehyung\u2019s hands on\nyour hips. <br>\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He asked with his mouth right by\nyour ear. </p><p>\u201cYou know what that does to me.\u201d His\ntone was angry.<br>\n\u201cNow let me fuck you like the good girl you are before I punish you like the\nbad girl you\u2019re trying to be.\u201d<br>\nYou nodded. <br>\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d<br>\nHis hand slid down the outside of your thighs as he squatted down behind you.<br>\nHe parted your lower lips with his fingers and didn\u2019t hesitate before pushing\ntwo of them in. You bit down on your lip and suppressed a moan as he roughly\nthrusted his fingers in and out, the only reason being to stretch you out for\nhim.<br>\nHe curled his fingers inside you causing you to clench lightly around them and\nhe pulled out.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re ready, bend down.\u201d He ordered and you did as told, more than ready to\nscream his name.</p><p><br>\nAs you bent down you looked over your shoulder, seeing his cock throb in his\nhand as it slid up and down with pre-cum dripping from the tip.<br>\nHe placed a hand on your butt cheek and dragged his cock up and down your slit.<br>\nHe placed his tip by your entrance and slowly began pushing himself in, groans\nescaping his mouth and yours as he stretched you out even more.</p><p><br>\n\u201cFuck you\u2019re still too tight.\u201d He whined and pulled out.<br>\n\u201cI can take it!\u201d You yelled, desperate for him to keep going.<br>\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked, the sweet tone suddenly returning.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sure! Just fuck me!\u201d You yelled, feeling your walls pulsating, desperate\nfor him.<br>\nHe began pushing himself into you again, groaning immensely as he slipped in\nall the way, making you moan loud followed by a deep exhale.<br>\nHe caressed your right butt cheek, staying still inside you, allowing you the\ntime to adjust.</p><p><br>\nA little whimper from you and he began to pull out and thrusted back in slowly.<br>\n\u201cFaster.\u201d You panted. </p><p>He increased his speed slightly but it\ndidn\u2019t last for long before he gave into his own need and began pounding into\nyou fast and hard, the two of you becoming a moaning mess.<br>\nTaehyung\u2019s grip on your hips tightened, signaling that he was close.<br>\n\u201cFuck\u201d he grunted and thrusted harder, hitting you to the limit.<br>\n\u201cTae- I-I\u2019m gonna-\u201d you panted and he thrusted faster.<br>\n\u201cYeah baby.\u201d He panted.<br>\nA few more thrusts and he pushed himself in deep and hard making your orgasm\nhit you hard and clench tightly around him, making him cum hard with a grunt.</p><p>You breathed heavily as he carefully\npulled out of you, some of his cum leaking out as he did.<br>\nHe hastily wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled your back up against\nhim and kissed your cheek.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d He whispered and chuckled lightly.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You typed away at the computer in your\noffice, checking the website you ran for the business and updated the filter to\nkeep out any \u201cunserious\u201d clients.</p><p>Of course the website wasn\u2019t something\nyou could simply google.</p><p>If you knew the url it would quickly\nbecome unusable as you changed the name of the website frequently as well as\nthe contact email.</p><p>\u201cSweetie?\u201d Taehyung suddenly called.</p><p>You stood up from your seat and walked\ninto his office. He was leaned forward at his laptop on his desk with a\nthoughtful expression.</p><p>As you walked up to him you stroked your\nhand over his shoulder before wrapping your arms around his neck and leaning\ndown by the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese or these?\u201d He moved the tiny\narrow on the screen around a pair of shoes and then clicked another tab and\nshowed another pair of shoes.</p><p>\u201cMission or leisure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeisure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the first ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want matching ones?\u201d He asked\nshyly, turning to his side to look at you.</p><p>\u201cAre there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly the same, but I found a\npair of heels that were in similar style.\u201d He clicked them up to show you the beautiful\nheels.</p><p>\u201cYou really like it when I wear heels\nhuh?\u201d You giggled.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He kissed your cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re conveniently here I need\nyou to have a look at this email.\u201d </p><p>Taehyung quickly searched up the email\nin the inbox and opened it for you to read.</p><p>-No subject.-</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to be a joke?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought the same. I\u2019m changing the\nemail just in case though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me when you have so I can update\nit on the page, I just changed the url of it.\u201d</p><p>You stood up straight and caressed his\nneck before abandoning him of your touch.</p><p>Before you managed to take a second step\ntowards your office your wrist was grabbed and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung moved his chair back from his\ndesk slightly and patted his lap with his other hand.</p><p>Just for a short while\u2026 you thought and\nwalked over to sit on his thighs.</p><p>\u201cCan you work like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can.\u201d He said and rested\nhis chin on your shoulder and reached for his computer with one arm on either\nside of you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the way.\u201d You laughed and moved\nto get back off but his arms quickly wrapped around your waist, stopping you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed you tightly around the hips\nand pulled you back against him properly so you were sitting over his crotch,\nwhere he wanted you.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t sit still, but stay.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>He ignored his work and began kissing\nyour neck softly.</p><p>You held on to the arm rests carefully\nand moved your hips in a slow teasing motion.</p><p>\u201cJust like that baby.\u201d He whispered,\nsatisfied by the gentle friction.</p><p>\u201cCan you wear the diamond necklace for\nme tonight? You haven\u2019t worn it since I got it for you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s precious to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I know you ah- yes right there baby\u2026\nIf I know you right, you\u2019re afraid to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s real diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd diamonds are replaceable. If anything\nhappens to it I\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201d </p><p>You could feel his hard on growing\nbetween his thighs and you grinded against him a little harder. His hands moved\nto your hips to control your movements but to your surprise he stopped you.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d </p><p>You looked at the time on the corner of\nhis laptop.</p><p>\u201cAlmost five.\u201d</p><p>He patted your thigh two times.</p><p>\u201cThe jewelry shop closes soon, we can\nmake it if we hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait why are we going there now?\u201d You\nasked confused and got up.</p><p>\u201cI want to buy you more diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung no.:\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d He said and got up\nfrom his chair. \u201cGet your coat, it\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>You stopped him in his steps by grabbing\nhis arms.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>You pointed down, trying to suffocate a\ngiggle.</p><p>He looked down at his bulge straining\nagainst his jeans.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Driving slightly over the speed limit\nyou made it to the shop right on time just before closing.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t given up on trying to talking\nhim out of getting you more expensive stuff yet, but you were near to. He was\nso stubborn and claimed that you\u2019d be more comfortable wearing the diamonds if\nyou had more of them which certainly wasn\u2019t true. But if it made him happy\u2026 </p><p>You sighed.</p><p>Taehyung immediately walked over to the\ndisplays of necklaces but your attention was caught by a pair of dainty\nearrings in one of the glass cabinets.</p><p>It seemed to be part of a collection as\nit was displayed next to a necklace, bracelet and ring in similar style. You\nlooked at the ring for a while and quickly shook off the feeling it gave you\nand moved on to the next display.</p><p>On dark blue velvet were a pair of\nsilver platted cufflinks and they immediately caught your liking.</p><p>They were expensive and you recognized\nthe luxury brand labelled next the price, but as someone who was paid well and\nwithout taxes you could afford to splurge on something for Taehyung\u2026 if he now\ninsisted on getting you something you could insist on getting him something as\nwell.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you Madame?\u201d A voice\nsuddenly asked behind you.</p><p>The name tag on the right side of his\nchest made it obvious that he worked in the shop and in regards of the dream\nyou had long ago, he was fairly young to your relief.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to buy these.\u201d You smiled\nand pointed towards the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cExcellent choice, they\u2019re from the\nnewest collection too. We received it last week.\u201d He smiled and grabbed the key\nto the cabinet hung on his belt.</p><p>Taehyung turned around and looked at you\nwith an odd look before making his way over.</p><p>\u201cDid you find something?\u201d</p><p>You nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cNot for me though.\u201d</p><p>The employee carefully picked up the\ncufflinks and locked the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back with the box.\u201d He\nsaid and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWho are you getting them for?\u201d He asked\nin a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cFor you of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d You teased with a\nsmile. \u201cI found something I like for myself as well though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe earrings.\u201d You said and pointed\ntowards them behind the glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Only them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me everything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else? Bracelets? Rings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRings?\u201d You giggled.</p><p>His cheeks went red but his serious\nexpression remained.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung you don\u2019t need to get me\neverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>The young employee returned with the\ncufflinks in a dark blue velvet box and wrapped it up neatly in a paper bag.</p><p>You walked over to the counter and paid\nfor the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d you smiled and took the\nbag.</p><p>While Taehyung received help getting the\nearrings you looked around in the rest of the shop. You spotted a pearl\nnecklace, it could be a choker as well but it was hard to tell from the way it\nwas displayed. Taehyung would look good in pearls\u2026</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d Taehyung suddenly asked\nwith a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, are you done?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI got you a bracelet too.\u201d</p><p>You looked down in defeat and took his\nhand in yours and you left the store.</p><p>The street outside was oddly calm and\nyou glanced around and saw a clothing shop and a hardware store further down the\nstreet.</p><p>\u201cOh that reminds me! Can we go to the\nhardware store quickly?\u201d Taehyung suddenly asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some basic tools.\u201d</p><p>You headed towards the hardware store\nthat was luckily open till later and found a basic tool box. Taehyung went to\nlook for a saw quickly and you walked up and down a random aisle and found\nvarious ropes. You felt one of them and the texture was strong and straw like.</p><p>A member of staff walked down the aisle\nand you quickly grabbed her attention.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, can I get three meters of\nthis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She smiled and grabbed a\nmeasuring tape from her pocket and began to measure out the length of the rope\nbefore cutting it off and rolling it up for you.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cRope?\u201d Taehyung questioned as he joined\nyou in the line to pay.</p><p>\u201cDid you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but why are you getting rope?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor fun.\u201d You smirked.</p><p>\u201cThe same fun why I need these tools?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>You walked back to the car with all your\nstuff and finally headed back home.</p><p>You knew why he needed the tools\u2026 your\nnext mission meant the two of you had to go somewhat undercover\u2026</p><p>He parked the car outside the house and\nyou brought everything inside.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you.\u201d You smiled and handed\nTaehyung the bag from jewelry shop.</p><p>He eagerly opened it, excited to have a\ncloser look at the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you baby.\u201d He smiled shyly and\ngave you a soft kiss.</p><p>\u201cI got something for you too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you!?\u201d You acted surprised, making\nyou both giggle.</p><p>The bracelet matched the earrings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing these tonight.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>You had a table booked at one of the\nfancier restaurants in town tonight, for date-night</p><p>After a refreshing shower you touched up\nyour makeup and got into a black fitted, shape flattering dress paired with the\ndiamond choker necklace and the dainty earrings. Taehyung wore a white shirt,\nwithout a crease to be seen and the cufflinks decorating the end of his sleeves\nwith a sparkle of shine. Paired with it were a pair of black slacks, black belt\nwith a silver buckle in the same tone as the cufflinks and a pair of dark red\nvelvet loafers.</p><p>Hand in hand looking expensive\u2026 there\nwas something about it that made you smile. Was this what power felt like?\nConfidence? The fact that you were wearing multiple tiny diamonds around your\nneck probably worth more than a few cars?</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d He smirked,\nadmiring you while lifting his glass to take a sip.</p><p>His gaze was burning in a way that made\nyou feel like he was eating you rather than the food.</p><p>\u201cIf only you knew what I had planned\nlater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanned?\u201d he looked intrigued. </p><p>\u201cTell me more\u201d</p><p>You slowly traced your fingers up and\ndown the thin stem of your glass.</p><p>Soft jazzy lounge music was surrounding\nyou.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about\nroleplaying?\u201d You said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cRoleplaying? Like police officer or maid\ntype roleplay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of\u2026 but I was thinking more of a\nhostage situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take you hostage?\u201d He\nsmirked.</p><p>Oh how wrong he was\u2026</p><p>You lifted your glass to your lips and\nleft him unanswered.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung took your coat for you and hung\nit up together with his own once you got back home.</p><p>Once he turned back around you grabbed\nthe collar of his shirt and kissed him roughly. </p><p>Before he could react you had already\npulled away.</p><p>His hands landed on your hips.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs, get undressed and wait on\nthe chair in the bedroom.\u201d You ordered.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret it. You\u2019re my hostage\nnow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me waiting too long.\u201d He\nsmirked and broke free from your hold and headed towards the stairs,\nunbuttoning his shirt at the same time.</p><p>You had placed the chair in the middle\nof the bedroom right before you left for the restaurant.</p><p>It was your turn to have some fun.</p><p>You pulled your dress over your head,\nrevealing the black lace body you were wearing underneath and hung it over the\nstaircase the railing as you walked up.</p><p>In Taehyung\u2019s office stood the bag from\nthe hardware store and you pulled out the rope before making your way to the\nbedroom.</p><p>Taehyung was leaned back against the\nchair with one arm over his waist as he stroked his cock slowly.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and stop touching\nyourself.\u201d You ordered, hiding the rope behind your back.</p><p>He did as told and hid his smirk behind\nhis long fingers that caressed his lips.</p><p>\u201cSit properly.\u201d</p><p>He sat up with his back to the backrest\nand you pulled the rope around him.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>You wrapped it around him twice,\nsecuring his arms to his sides and tied it behind.</p><p>You dragged your hand along his jaw as\nyou walked to stand in front of him and then placed them firmly against his\nthighs.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>You moved your hands further up his\ntoned thighs and he opened his eyes.</p><p>At the sight of your outfit a wide smirk\nspread across his face and he poked his cheek with his tongue. He looked down\nat the rope around his body, his erection and your hands and back to your face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>You spread his thighs apart and took a\nseat on his left one, crossing a leg over your other and rested your arm\nagainst his shoulder, grabbing his earlobe.</p><p>\u201cYou have adorable ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do to me?\u201d he asked\nagain.</p><p>You caressed his jaw and tilted his face\nto your side and leaned in towards his lips, leaving little to no space\nbetween. He leaned forward and you backed slightly, making him lean forward\neven more, desperate for your kiss until the rope held him back and his arms\nstrained against it.</p><p>You giggled.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019d do if I got out of\nthese ropes huh?\u201d He asked in a cocky threatening tone.</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the head of\nhis cock and let him slide through your tight grip, making him whimper loudly.</p><p>\u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>You let go of him, starting your build\nup for his desperation.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to be a bit\ndisciplined.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close again, brushing his nose\nagainst your cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me beg for you?\u201d\nHe whispered sultry.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d You grabbed his neck with\none hand and pushed him back.</p><p>His fringe barely covered his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it was for me to\nhold back earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d You let your hand\nslide down his neck to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI already have a build-up, be nice.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the head of his cock again\nand slid your hand off it, making him lean his head back and whimper once more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby- please\u2026 please be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>You got off his thigh and hunched down\nbetween his thighs and placed a soft his against the tip of his sensitive cock\nbefore swirling your tongue around it. He leaned his head back, giving you a\nview of his thick neck.</p><p>You moved your hair to the side and took\noff your diamond choker and stood back up.</p><p>\u201cIt would look good on you.\u201d You smirked\nand straddled his thigh as you put the choker around his neck.</p><p>You placed two fingers under his chin\nand leaned in to kiss him, finally giving him what he wanted.</p><p>You slipped your tongue in, immediately\nclaiming dominance of the kiss before tangling your hands in his hair and\ntugging at it gently.</p><p>One of your hands fell to his neck\ninstead and stroked down his chest and abdomen to the base of his cock. You\nwrapped your hand around his thick shaft and began jerking him off, making him\nmoan against the kiss.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna cum for me?\u201d You\nwhispered, briefly pulling away from the kiss and suffocating his response with\nyour lips and tongue, making him only possible to give out a long whimper in\nrhythm with your hand\u2019s movements.</p><p>His whimpers grew more frequent and you\ncaressed his tip with your thumb.</p><p>He was breathing heavily and you pulled\naway from the kiss to allow him to catch his breath and hear his sweet moans as\nyou jerked him off faster. He leaned his head back and cursed and you moved\nyour hand from his hair to his neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u201d</p><p>You pulled your hand away.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! Please don\u2019t stop!\u201d He squirmed.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Ah- Fuck!\u201d His breathing got\nheavier and his thigh quivered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me cum!\u201d</p><p>You ignored his begging and stood up and\ntook a step back to stand in front of him as you reached for the shoulder of\nyour lace body and slipped it down.</p><p>His breathing was calming down and his\nhead leaned down and he looked up at you with an intimidating frown.</p><p>Small bead of sweat had formed by his\nchest, making his skin glow.</p><p>You slipped the other side down your\nshoulder and pulled the lace down to your waist, exposing your breasts. You\nwalked over to your nightstand table, out of Taehyung\u2019s view and grabbed a hair\ntie to tie up your hair.</p><p>When you returned to him you took a seat\non your knees between his legs.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard I\u2019m going to fuck\nyou for that?\u201d He muttered.</p><p>You flicked your finger across his tip\nand he winced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lay you across my lap and\nspank you until you beg for my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>\u201cI dare you to do your worst baby\u2026\nJust know I\u2019ll get you back for it\u201d</p><p>You snorted and rolled your eyes at him.\nA mere second later he bit his lip hard as you grabbed his aching cock and\nswirled your tongue around the tip.</p><p>You took his head into your mouth and\nsucked gently and he hummed in pleasure, leaning his head back.</p><p>\u201cDo I taste good baby?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>His bratty attitude was becoming more\nand more of a burden\u2026</p><p>You pulled him out of your mouth and\nstood back up with a serious expression.</p><p>His gaze travelled up your entire body,\nadmiring the view as you took off the lace completely, leaving you fully nude.</p><p>You sat down on his thigh again and\ntangled one hand in his hair, pushing his head away from you to stretch out his\nneck before your lips attacked it, right above the diamonds that decorated him.\nWith your other hand your swirled you finger around his tip. He inhaled sharply\nand you let out a low long whimper by his neck, knowing it would drive him\ncrazy.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026\u201d</p><p>You got up without breaking your touch\nand straddled his thigh and started to grind down on him. Moving back and\nforth, creating friction for yourself that made your desire and arousal grow\nworse. You let out another moan and lowered your hand in a fist over his cock\nand jerked him off teasingly slow. </p><p>Holding your balance was a struggle so\nyou got up and let go of his cock instead and he looked disappointed till you\npushed his thighs closer together and straddled him properly over his hips.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d He smirked, hoping you\u2019d finally\nride him.</p><p>You put your hands on his neck and\ncrashed your lips against his. You could feel his cock throb by your thigh and\nhe strained against the ropes, pointlessly trying to get closer to you.</p><p>He leaned his head back and managed to\nbreak the kiss, slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cPlease touch me.\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cBaby please, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me that bad?\u201d You caressed his\ncheek.</p><p>\u201cI always want you! I want you so\nfucking bad! But I\u2019m gonna go crazy if you either don\u2019t remove these ropes so I\ncan push you down onto my cock myself or if you ride me baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my hostage; I\u2019m not setting you\nfree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please.\u201d He pleaded, looking\nhelpless.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>You reached down between you to grab his\ncock.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He begged again, looking\npitiful.</p><p>You positioned the tip by your entrance\nand he didn\u2019t dare say anything, afraid his words would make you change your\nmind.</p><p>You lowered yourself and he moaned\nloudly. With your hands on his shoulders you allowed him to slide in all the\nway slowly.</p><p>\u201cFuck you\u2019re so tight\u2026\u201d He groaned and\nsquirmed, moving his thighs.</p><p>Your own relief distracted you and you\nbegan to ride him to get some pleasure for yourself.</p><p>He was so sensitive to your touch by now\nthat he turned into a moaning mess by the least amount of movement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d He begged, panting.</p><p>His big eyes looked innocent, something\nyou wouldn\u2019t fall for.</p><p>You went faster and deeper, making his\nthighs tense. You brushed his hair away from his face by pulling it all back\nand he groaned.</p><p>\u201cJust let me hold your thighs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed onto his broad shoulders to\nsupport yourself as you tried to ride him even faster, quickly sending him\nclose to his desperate release.</p><p>\u201cPlease let me cum baby.\u201d He whispered,\nalmost inaudible.</p><p>He let out a long groan that grew\ngradually higher in pitch and finishes in almost a whimper.</p><p>\u201cJust a little more.\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cA little more- ah-\u201c</p><p>The knot in your core was starting to\nbreak lose and you could feel yourself coming closer and closer to your own\nrelease but you didn\u2019t want to let him cum\u2026 not yet\u2026 only one more time and\nyou\u2019d let him have it his way after, but was it worth giving up your own build\nup?</p><p>\u201cBaby I\u2019m gonna cum, don\u2019t stop, please\nI\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close too aren\u2019t you? Let\u2019s cum\ntogether baby, don\u2019t let this go.\u201d He tried to convince followed by a loud\nmoan.</p><p>His entire body tensed up beneath you\nand you pushed yourself up and his cock slipped out of you, throbbing.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this to me!?\u201d He cried\nout.</p><p>He was breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cBaby I give up, it hurts, I need to\ncum!\u201d</p><p>He tried to pull his arms out of the\nrope but you held his shoulders in place, trying to stop him.</p><p>You lowered yourself over his cock again\nand he threw his head back with a frustrated scream</p><p>You wrapped your arms around his neck\nand chased your own release, skin slapping against skin as your rode him deep\nand hard.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna cum for me baby?\u201d You\nasked.</p><p>His answer was pointless as he moaned\nout loud and you could feel his load release within you.</p><p>He cursed and his skin was glowing from\nthe sweat and his chest was moving rapidly up and down. You reached down to rub\nyour clit to get closer to your release, beginning to feel bad for him\u2026</p><p>Your muscles clenched and tingled and\nyour bit your lip as you found your well built up climax and milked his cock of\nevery last drop of cum he had to offer. When you moved up his throbbing cock\nslipped out and landed on his thigh, followed by a stream of his cum spilling.</p><p>He coughed softly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d you caressed his cheek and\nhe looked at you with his wide eyes and an exhausted expression.</p><p>\u201cUntie me.\u201d</p><p>Was he mad?</p><p>You carefully got off him, your thighs\nquivering slightly and untied the rope. Before you had the chance to get it off\nof him he had yanked it off himself and stood up and grabbed you with both arms\ntight.</p><p>His lips found your and he kissed you\nhard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking amazing.\u201d He groaned,\nvoice shaky and legs weak.</p><p>\u201cJust you wait for my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were mad for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never cum that hard before.\u201d He\nwhispered, like a dirty little secret being confessed.</p><p>He walked over to the bed on shaky legs\nand fell down on it.</p><p>\u201cJust you wait.\u201d He groaned. \u201dNow come\nhere and soothe me and show me that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you needy for some aftercare now?\u201d\nyou giggled and walked over to the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, you did well.\u201d You climbed up by\nhis side and ruffled his hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d He muttered and snuggled\nup against you.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Warm under the covers, head and hand on\nhis chest and soft breathing\u2026</p><p>But you were suddenly woken up by\nTaehyung abruptly sitting up, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d You groaned and looked up at him\nconfused.</p><p>He looked panicked.</p><p>\u201care you ok?\u201d You asked worried.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI- I had a nightmare\u2026 its ok.\u201d He said\nin a deep hoarse voice.</p><p>He lied back down again and you took\nyour spot on his chest back and caressed him softly with your hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry I woke you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. What did you\ndream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, it\u2019s ok now and you\u2019re\nhere with me.\u201d He rolled on to his side and pulled you close.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like nothing to me if\nit was enough to wake you up baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, just go back to sleep now \u2026\nand don\u2019t let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and tightened his hold to make\nyou stop.</p><p>You kissed his cheek and put your arm around\nhis waist.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung was still knocked out fast\nasleep when you woke up in the morning, but you kept your promise and held on\nto him tight until he finally would wake up.</p><p>You both slept in and Taehyung woke up a\nlittle while later and you peppered his face with a bunch of kisses, making him\ngiggle and wake up in one of the best ways possible.</p><p>You caressed his cheek with your hand\nand he smiled and looked at you lovingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy I have you.\u201d He confessed,\nmaking you smile shyly.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream that you were taken away\nfrom me and I felt so lost and I kept running around looking for you without\nknowing where to even look and I panicked and then I woke up and it was such a\nrelief to see you on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, ever.\u201d You\nensured.</p><p>He took your hand from his face and\npressed his lips against it softly.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>You both took the day off today since\nworking from home was highly risky\u2026</p><p>You were seated in the office and looked\nthrough your private emails, clearing your inbox and saving whatever was of\nimportance while Taehyung was in the shower.</p><p>You checked your spam in case something\nhad been miss-categorized and spotted an email with a subject from a weird\nlooking email address.</p><p>You clicked it open and read it.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, changing your\nemails won\u2019t keep me away.</p><p>10 million, if you kill the person I\nwant dead.\u201d</p><p>How did this person get a hold of your\nprivate email!?</p><p>It felt pointless to block them but you\ndid anyway, they could just send you another email from another address unless\nyou entirely blocked the IP.</p><p>You ignored it.</p><p>If they wanted your help, they had to\ncontact you through your work email.</p><p>10 million? You could pull a finger nail\nfor that but kill? What cheapskate was this?</p><p>There were plenty of people out there\nthat would kill for that but you and Taehyung were professionals.</p><p>You had loyal clients, high officials\nfor companies who knew you and you were loyal to.</p><p>Some even sent you Christmas cards.</p><p>It was a dark underground business full\nof risks and you didn\u2019t kill for anyone\u2026</p><p>After some quick clicks you managed to\nget the IP blocked from your email account and deleted the email.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first or second time you\nheard \u201cI know who you are\u201d. People knew of you within the business but they\ndidn\u2019t know who you were. It was a cheap trick to seem intimidating and with\nthe price offered it was obvious the person tried to seem threatening in order\nto get the price down. Your price range was clearly listed on the website and\n10 million was pathetic\u2026</p><p>If they emailed your work email you\ncould respond with the price range there, you refused to take it via your\nprivate email and the fact that they had the audacity to find your private\naddress and email it already had them in some dangerous waters.</p><p>Maybe you came off as na\u00efve but the\npeople knew who they were dealing with when they sent this\u2026 you were\nprofessional assassinators, dangerous people.</p><p>A threatening response would have any\nunserious requester to grow immensely paranoid.</p><p>You could take care of this tomorrow\nwhen you would go back to the office, today was a day off after all. You\nswitched off the computer with a determined move and leaned back on the chair.</p><p>A brief moment later the door carefully\npushed open and Taehyung peaked in, dressed only in a towel wrapped snug around\nhis hips.</p><p>\u201cBabe can you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course honey!\u201d You got up from the\nchair and walked over to him by the door.</p><p>He held out his hand with a dainty chain\nhanging over his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to lock it three times now\nbut I give up.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the chain bracelet and\nhelped him put it on and thus the email was forgotten.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He smiled cutely and walked\nback towards your bedroom with you following him.</p><p>\u201cOh? Are you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to watch me get dressed?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was actually going to go downstairs\nbut since you\u2019re offering a show\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reverse strip tease, watch me get\ndressed.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>You took a seat on the neatly made bed\nand watched him as he walked over to the large closet.</p><p>He assembled an outfit and carried the\npile of clothes back out into the bedroom and placed it down next to you.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks good.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the towel loose and allowed it\nto fall from his hips, exposing him and acted like nothing.</p><p>You admired the view and he grabbed the\nwhite knitted sweater he had selected and pulled it over his head. He bent over\nslightly and put on a pair of boxers and finished off with black fitted jeans.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The day turned out to be quite the\ndomestic one. You went grocery shopping, snuggled with some Netflix, cooked\ndinner and just enjoyed a calm day together with each other\u2019s company. The calm\ndown time you had always managed to remind you of how much you really loved\nthis man.</p><p>To be honest your job was quite\nstressful and could be a source of anxiousness at times.</p><p>The real question was how long the two\nof you would keep this on? For sure you couldn\u2019t be hitmen for the rest of your\nlives\u2026 what if you had kids one day? Mummy and daddy couldn\u2019t go around killing\npeople and burning expensive shoes then, what type of role models would that\nmake you?</p><p>You had plenty of money to never have to\nworry, more than so and despite living together and sharing your life, Taehyung\nstill paid you generously. You did a job after all but it felt odd at times\nsince he tended to swipe his card for you more than necessary either way.</p><p>The discussion about it was pointless\nbecause he wouldn\u2019t listen\u2026</p><p>His warm breathe suddenly tickled your\nneck.</p><p>You were seated on the large white\nliving room sofa in front of the TV downstairs. His hand stroked up and down\nyour thigh and his lips pressed softly against your neck.</p><p>With a low smacking sound he sucked at\nyour skin, leaving a kiss in between every once in a while. His hand grabbed\nyour and placed it against his bulge and you palmed him gently, making him hum\nin pleasure against your neck.</p><p>Before you knew it his lips found yours\nand you were hungrily kissing each other.</p><p>Your hand rubbed against his growing\nbulge harder and you felt yourself grow needy by the mere second.</p><p>Taehyung began to get up from the sofa\nwithout breaking the kiss and with a swift move he lifted you up into his arms\nbridal style.</p><p>He broke the kiss and carried you\ntowards the stairs.</p><p>There was something deviant about his\nsmirk\u2026</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for my revenge baby.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>He carefully put you back down on your\nfeet in the bedroom and grabbed the hem of his sweater and pulled it up over\nhis head, throwing it to the floor.</p><p>\u201cStrip.\u201d He ordered, dragging a finger\nunder your chin.</p><p>His hands grabbed his belt buckle and\nbegan to undo it while he watched you with an intense glare.</p><p>You grabbed the hem of your own sweater\nand pulled it over your head.</p><p>You wanted to kiss him and have you pull\nyour clothes off each other but you didn\u2019t dare disobey him quite yet\u2026</p><p>You unhooked your bra and let it fall\ndown your arms and on to the floor.</p><p>He unzipped his jeans.</p><p>You wore a pair of black work out\nleggings and hooked your thumbs under the hem, pulling them down over your hips\nslowly along with your underwear.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>His jeans were off and he reached into\nhis boxers to free his erection before letting the remaining piece of fabric\nfall down his toned thighs.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees.\u201d He ordered, once\nyou were fully naked.</p><p>You followed his lead and got down on\nyour knees, looking up at him with an anticipated smirk.</p><p>He took a few steps closer and tangled a\nhand in your hair.</p><p>\u201cSuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t try any tricks.\u201d</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the base of\nhis shaft and took him into your mouth, pressing your tongue against the faint\nveins and sucking passionately.</p><p>He licked his lips, looking down at you\nwith a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth does wonders to me baby.\u201d He\npraised, scratching your head soothingly and pushing you a bit deeper.</p><p>\u201cI know you can take a bit more.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head back and moaned\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cJust like that baby, you know how I\nlike it\u2026\u201d</p><p>You failed to see how this was his\nrevenge\u2026 you enjoyed sucking him off\u2026 especially when it came with countless of\npraise.</p><p>He cupped your face with his large hands\nand took a step back, slipping out of your mouth with a string of saliva\nfollowing.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed, all fours.\u201d</p><p>He helped you up and you climbed up on\nthe large bed as he watched.</p><p>His hand caressed your ass gently.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what I\u2019m about to do to your\nbaby\u2026 but I warned you.\u201d</p><p>Following his words was a loud slap\nsound and a stinging sensation against your right butt cheek.</p><p>You felt your wetness almost leak down\nyour slit from the masochistic pleasure it gave you afterwards.</p><p>He spanked you a second time before\ngetting up on the bed himself.</p><p>Without warning he slipped two of his\nfingers into you and curled, tugging against your muscles teasingly.</p><p>\u201cAlready so wet\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pulled his fingers out and let them\nslide down your slit to your clit and brushed against it teasingly, making you\neven more aroused and wet.</p><p>\u201cGet on your back, I want to see your\nexpression when I touch you.\u201d</p><p>You did as told.</p><p>\u201cSo obedient\u2026 afraid of what I\u2019ll do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d He said pushed your\nthighs apart wide.</p><p>He leaned forward and licked up your\nslit and over your sensitive clit. He thrusted his fingers back into you and\npushed against your inner muscles roughly as his tongue licked across and\naround your clit repeatedly.</p><p>He groaned, sending a gentle vibration\nthrough you and making it all worse.</p><p>You inhaled sharply and failed to hinder\nyour moans much longer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear\u2026\u201d He\nwhispered, followed by a light chuckle.</p><p>He curled his fingers faster, brushing\nagainst your sweet spot and sending you close to an orgasm. Your thighs tensed\nup and your juices were coating his fingers generously.</p><p>You moaned his name, pleading as his\ntongue caressed your clit once more; making you curl your toes before his touch\nabruptly abandoned you.</p><p>He licked his lips and fingers, looking\ndown at you with the most deviant of smirks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s aches, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stroked your thighs soothingly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>You blushed.</p><p>\u201cI could kiss every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand against the bed on\neither side of you and leaned down over you and kissed your right nipple.</p><p>He trailed his kisses between your\nbreasts to the other nipple and latched on to it, sucking roughly and making it\nhard.</p><p>His lips released your nipple delicately\nand he moved back down to between your thighs. His hand gripped them firmly as\nhis tongue licked up your slit again, hitting at your clit and making you\nsquirm from the sensitive tingle, he thrusted his tongue against your entrance,\npushing past with ease and giving you a need to cry out at the teasing feeling.</p><p>The pressure of his tongue so near your\nentrance made you desperate for something to penetrate you deeper. The second\nyou grabbed his hair he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cNo baby, behave. I know you\u2019re eager\nbut I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a hold of his cock and moved\ncloser to you.

You tried to clench your thighs but he held\nthem apart with his hips pressed tight against your crotch.</p><p>\u201cOh no\u2026 were you close baby?\u201d he pouted\nand chuckled.</p><p>He reached down between you bodies and\npositioned the tip of his cock by your entrance again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to thrust back in baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven saying please? You\u2019re really\nobedient\u2026 maybe I should-\u201c</p><p>He inserted the head.</p><p>\u201cReward you?\u201d</p><p>You clenched tightly around the little\nhe gave you.</p><p>\u201cIs it not enough?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cThen beg baby.\u201d He said in a serious\ntone.</p><p>\u201cPlease honey, I want you deeper.\u201d</p><p>He slipped in slightly further.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Please! I need you so bad!\u201d You\nhit the bed, frustrated.</p><p>He snapped his hips against you,\nthrusting in hard and making you moan loud.</p><p>He picked up his pace again and fucked\nyou hard.</p><p>It was harder for him to hold back, his\nrelease coming closer sooner than he wanted it to.</p><p>\u201cFuck it.\u201d He mumbled and pounded into\nyou harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really close to cum for you baby,\nare you ready?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to take my load?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>With each thrust he left out a soft moan\nand they quickly turned into load whimpers and groans as he moved his hips with\nmore force, pounding deeper and harder with straining grunts, chasing the final\nsteps to his edge.</p><p>The tight knot in your core was\nunbearable and you couldn\u2019t wait much longer for him to send you into your\ndesired and immensely craved for orgasm.</p><p>He pulled out without warning, leaving\nyou with the absolute worst of aching feelings.</p><p>He\ncrashed his lips against yours and reached down to jerk himself off until he\nsquirted his cum out on your abdomen.</p><p>\u201dHow\ndoes that feel baby? Huh? Does it feel good princess? Did you want that? All my\ncum on your precious body? Or did you want my cock to cum in your pretty pussy\ninstead?

Now beg.\u201d</p><p>He\nmoved down and sat on his knees.</p><p>\u201dTell me how much you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how much you want me and I\u2019ll let you have\nyour orgasm sweetie, if you\u2019re a really good girl I\u2019ll give you my second\nload.\u201d</p><p>He jerked himself off roughly, breathing heavily. A\nwhimper escaped his throat and you could tell he was overstimulated. The tip of\nhis cock was blushed a deep pink.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d </p><p>He raised a brow, waiting for your pleading words.\nWith his free hand he pressed his thumb firmly against your clit.</p><p>\u201cWorry about yourself and beg.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed against your clit, driving you insane from\nthe smallest touch.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung please!

But you\u2019re going to make me cum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>He moved his thumb faster and you cried out.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung please!

Can you track the IP back?\u201d</p><p>Your hands were shaking as you typed at the computer\nand Taehyung noticed and grabbed your hand and crouched down by your side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ok?\u201d he kissed it and let go.</p><p>You got up the IP but it showed a public library\u2026</p><p>\u201cThey sent an email to my private email address\nyesterday asking for a kill for ten but they never said of who and I\nimmediately blocked them.\u201d You confessed.</p><p>\u201cYour private one?!\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stood up with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it recently but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this, start another business\u2026 with fewer risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had the same thought\u2026 we can\u2019t do this forever\nwhat if-\u201c You held back.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we had kids one day, what would they think of\nus?\u201d</p><p>Had he read your mind?</p><p>\u201cBut the threat\u2026 they know where we live Taehyung and\nthey want you dead!?\u201d You cried out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll move, burn it all and make sure they can\u2019t find\nus I- we can\u2019t contact the police\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t burn everything we want to hide Tae! Burning\nwould give us unwanted attention!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do!\u201d He panicked \u201cWho could\nit be? Maybe some ally to someone we\u2019ve assassinated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Tae, the IP doesn\u2019t give us much. It\ncould be anyone.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a hand through his hair in pure frustration\nand anxiety.</p><p>\u201cFake my death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they want the body!\u201d</p><p>Taehyung grabbed his phone out his pocket and walked\nout of your office.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call our clients, I\u2019m going to find who\nthis is, kill them and then we\u2019re quitting!\u201d</p><p>You gulped.</p><p>Witch a quick click you marked the email as unread,\nhoping it would do something and then deleted the entire account. It would be\nfor the best if you lay low for now and didn\u2019t have any business email\navailable to contact. You walked out to listen to Taehyung\u2019s phone calls and\ntook a seat on his chair while he was seated on the edge of his desk, waiting\nanxiously for someone to pick up.</p><p>\u201cHey it\u2019s Tae.\u201d</p><p>He put on speaker phone so you could eavesdrop.</p><p>\u201cOh? Hey, hold on a second I\u2019m just going to go\nsomewhere more in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, shoot, how\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good, can you tell me everything you know and\nthe reason behind your last booking?\u201d Taehyung asked in a strict tone.</p><p>\u201cIs there an issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The voice on the other end sighed.</p><p>\u201cHe made meth, delivered to us regularly. He asked for\ncash upon request and failed to deliver our orders and I told him if you don\u2019t\nhand us the money back and give us our delayed orders it\u2019s over for you, I have\nmy own customers waiting for me and I was in a sticky situation with multiple\nof them, thus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he affiliated with anyone or a gang or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of, according to our background\nchecks he was a solo business man. But who knows. Why? If you\u2019re in trouble you\nknow I\u2019ll help out, you\u2019ve helped me countless times and I\u2019m forever in debt\nfor your loyalty, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, or well my lady who is listening too by the way,\njust got a request sent to kill me for 10 million.\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 million?\u201d The voice laughed.</p><p> \u201cThey know\nwhere we live, sent proof and they claimed if she doesn\u2019t do it, they will.\nTracking the IP gave us nothing and I need to find out who these idiots or\nidiot are or is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Tae don\u2019t worry, I say don\u2019t get home\nfirst of all because you never know. Forward everything you got and I\u2019ll have\nmy staff look at it more thoroughly ok? Maybe the IP doesn\u2019t give anything but\nif the device he used has a location on we can easily track where they\u2019ve been\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, we appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! You still have my email right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it.\u201d You whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk great, I\u2019ll update you as soon as they get\nanything form it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and placed the phone next to him on the\ndesk with a deep sigh.</p><p>You caressed his back soothingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we made a deal with them instead? Paid them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey clearly want me dead.\u201d Taehyung admitted,\nhanging his head low.</p><p>You pushed the chair back loudly, making him look up.\nYou felt anger bubble up within you, this wasn\u2019t fun, and you didn\u2019t want to\nsee him hang his head down in defeat this early on. </p><p>Your hands cupped his cheeks and you looked deeply\ninto his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBaby listen, nothing is going to happen to you, or us\non my watch. Whoever this is they\u2019re digging their own grave right now because\nthey\u2019re not going to get what they want and they\u2019re not getting away with their\nattempts even if that means I personally have to kill them.\u201d</p><p>You kissed his lips softly.</p><p>\u201cOk?\u201d You tilted your head to the side with a smile.</p><p>He nodded slowly, looking away from your gaze.</p><p>\u201cNow forward the email you got to me and I\u2019ll forward\nthem all together onwards.\u201d You ordered, patting his cheek lightly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you so calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified, but that won\u2019t solve anything.\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p>You forwarded everything you had to Taehyung\u2019s contact\na while ago and ever since the phone call Taehyung had been oddly silent and\nwithdrawn, deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d He answered each time you asked if he was\nalright. How he acted only made you worry more and more and eventually you\nconvinced him to go out and grab something to eat with you. Maybe some energy\nwould lighten him or you could hopefully distract him until your contact had\nany news or updates for you.</p><p>The two of you ended up going home instead and\nbringing take out with you back.</p><p>At the table Taehyung poked at his food while you ate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2026\u201d He started.</p><p>\u201cI can tell, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what we- or well I should do\ninstead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling people for a living.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t comment on it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d He confessed,\nsitting back straight.</p><p>\u201cBefore anything worse happens\u2026 I just think this is a\nsign that we should stop doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just stop, we don\u2019t need to do anything until\nwe figure something out babe. It\u2019s going to be ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I had something in mind ever since you\ntold me about that dream you had long ago\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with the diamonds\u2026 Ever since you mentioned\nit I actually bought a few\u2026 and I sold one last week, as a test\u2026 and I sold it\nat the double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe double?\u201d</p><p>He nodded shyly, yet proudly.</p><p>\u201cI might have rounded up the karat amount a bit\u2026 but\nthe double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble cash or with tax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the table of course\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho bought it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSome dude from Russia, I don\u2019t know. He sent me the\nmoney and I shipped the diamond off express delivery, declared it as glass and\nthat was it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 How much was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c156 million us dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I tried to make it look like we were situated\nin America also as a test and it seemingly worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t he see where it was shipped from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI printed my own customs label and just edited the\naddress to the amazon warehouse as sender, it was easy and people don\u2019t care\nthey just handle it and send it onwards.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI can buy you the biggest house, which ever you\nwant.\u201d He smirked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying half of it, no discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You held you finger up to silence him.</p><p>\u201cBut we need a new house yes\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we look right now? Just for fun?\u201d He asked\neagerly.</p><p>You were relieved that he was in a better mood from\ntelling you about the sudden diamond trading experiment.</p><p>\u201cEat up first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get my laptop we can eat at the same time.\u201d\nHe said and ran out of the kitchen towards the stairs.</p><p>Buying expensive stuff\u2026 a solid distraction.</p><p>Taehyung left his phone on the kitchen counter and it\nsuddenly rang.</p><p>You grabbed it and saw it was your contact and\nimmediately answered for him with your name followed by \u201cthis is Taehyung\u2019s\nphone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I haven\u2019t spoken to you in ages! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, how are you?\u201d You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAll good, say it\u2019s late why are you still at work? Is\nTaehyung keeping you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 \u00a0we live\ntogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is news! But speaking of news I have some\nupdates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my staff found out that he knew the last guy we\ncalled for, he was his right hand in the business and they were close we\nspeculate. Either way he\u2019s about the same age and we also speculate since the\nheist was made to look like a suicide the police probably confiscated the meth\nlab which obviously would be a an inconvenience for him. What we can see too he\nseems to know what he\u2019s doing with computers and hacking, how on earth he found\nout about you is astonishing\u2026 he must have known about us and hacked us and\nfound out that way and if the fault is on us I can\u2019t do anything but deeply\napologize to both of you and offer anything we can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who he is? Or where he lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a name but no address yet unfortunately,\nwe\u2019re working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeon Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung returned to the kitchen with his laptop in\nhis arms. By the site of you with his phone by his ear his smile fell back into\nthe worrying pout.</p><p>You lowered the phone from your ear and put on speaker\nphone.</p><p>\u201cCan you call us when you find out more about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe you.\u201d</p><p>You hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cThey know who it is, but they\u2019re still trying to find\nhis whereabouts and when they do\u2026. It\u2019s over for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe final kill\u2026\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>Taehyung put the laptop down on the counter and took a\nseat before switching it on.</p><p>\u201cOur priority now is getting us in safety, so let\u2019s\nfind a house\u2026 or something temporary we can get on short notice until we get a\nproper new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d You said and took another bite of your\nfood.</p><p>\u201cAny special requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen space and big windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and in a secluded area with guards and 24 hours\nsecurity.\u201d He added.</p><p>Buying a house on short notice maybe wasn\u2019t that easy\nbut when you were able to pay upfront in cash\u2026 you were any real estate agent\u2019s\ndream.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Fast forward it was easier said than done to find a\nhouse without looking at it and you instead opted for temporarily settling at\nthe suite of a hotel until you found something that suited you. After a few\ncalls you had a real estate agent that could assist you on short notice and\nshow you around a few properties in the upcoming days.</p><p>You still hadn\u2019t heard back from your contact\nregarding Jungkook and the little research you attempted to do yourself hadn\u2019t\ngiven much. You knew your codes and IP disguises but beyond that your hacking\nskills were fairly limited and the people your contact had were professionals.</p><p>All you could do was wait, trust and be on your guard.</p><p>In the given moment you were resting against\nTaehyung\u2019s bare chest in the large bed of the hotel suite after haven eaten\nsome room service food you\u2019d called for\u2026 and then having sex.</p><p>In all honesty it was something you needed more than\nyou thought. To destress and get everything out of you to clear your mind and\nspike your mood back.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s fingers drew lazy spirals up and down your\narm as you both calmed down and you couldn\u2019t help but admire his hand as it\nmoved slowly across your skin.</p><p>\u201cYou always wear such nice rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d He said, stopping the circles and holding\nout up his hands to look for himself at the dainty jewelry decorating his long\nfingers.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cEach ring has a sentimental meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognize this one.\u201d You pointed towards his ring\nfinger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you picked it, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, it\u2019s for 100<sup>th</sup> kill\u2026 I asked you to\npick something and you choose this ring.\u201d</p><p>The memory returned to you.</p><p>It was indeed long ago and you were in a jewelry\nstore. Back then he was colder and his told you to pick out a ring for him\nbecause he \u201cCouldn\u2019t be bothered to\u201d, you didn\u2019t know what for at the time and\nonly did as you were told.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to pick it because it felt special\u2026 but\nI was dumb enough to not say anything, but I was too shy to\u2026 and since you\u2019d\nhelped me so many times I wanted you to be a part of it in some way\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet.\u201d You giggled and traced across the\nrings with your fingertips, feeling the surface of the dainty silver.</p><p>\u201cI should get rid of it though\u2026 once we\u2019re done I\u2019m\nnever going to assassinate for anyone ever again and then I\u2019m going to throw it\naway.\u201d His voice sounded determined. </p><p>He squished you closer against his body briefly as he\nreached for his hand with his other to pull the ring off and to your surprise he\ntossed it across the room.</p><p>The silver clinked loudly as it hit the wooden floor\nand rolled away across the room.</p><p>\u201cI want to wear something else on this finger anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever get married one day, I\u2019ll need this finger\nin particular.\u201d</p><p>Your cheeks were burning from his words and you hid\nyour face against his chest. </p><p>He laughed softly at your reaction and patted your\nback.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026 Are you tired? Why are you hiding from me?\u201d He\nteased.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sleep time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d He giggled and moved his hand to your\nwaist to tickle you.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung stop!\u201d You laughed, squirming and trying to\nget away from his hand by climbing over him. A dumb choice and a fortunate\nmistake in once.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you\ndown, rolling on top of you and crashing his lips against your neck and\ncontinued to tickle your waist.</p><p>Your cheekbones were aching from the laughing and he\nfinally stopped. Instead he moved his lips from your necks to yours and kissed\nyou slowly and passionately, sliding his hands further up your sides.</p><p>It had almost a soothing effect on you the way he\nslowly caressed your lips with his own.</p><p>After a short while he pulled away and nuzzled your\nneck.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You shook the hand of the real estate agents and said\nyour goodbyes after being shown around multiple properties and quite a few that\ncaught your liking. You were handed a pile of papers of each property to look\nover in private before making any further decisions and you eagerly received\nthem.</p><p>In the car on your way back to the hotel your phone\ndinged, as it would\u2026 but this was a text from and unknown number\u2026</p><p>You could feel your heart sink.</p><p>\u201cYou have 24 hours.\u201d</p><p>You immediately forwarded it to your contact.</p><p>\u201cI just got a text and it says I have 24 hours\u2026 I\nthink it\u2019s from him.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung suddenly hit the brakes hard and did a\ndrastic U-turn.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I should\u2019ve gotten rid of our phones!\u201d He\ngroaned and hit the wheel.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving us a lead to him at least, I forwarded\nit already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking any more risks. The second they find\nhim we get on the next plane back and I\u2019m fucking killing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack from where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever flight has seats available, we\u2019re leaving\nthe country either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am! Turn your phone off!\u201d</p><p>With one hand on the wheel he grabbed his own out of\nhis pocket and handed it to you.</p><p>\u201cTurn it off too and throw them out of the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust throw them out!\u201d</p><p>You turned his phone off and rolled down the window\nand tossed them out on the side of the highway hard, smashing them both.</p><p>Adrenaline began to take over and Taehyung stepped on\nthe gas harder.</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to call us now if they find him\nTaehyung!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck! Maybe they have computers we could borrow or an\ninternet caf\u00e9 at the airport, anything!? We can send them and email? I didn\u2019t\nthink about that, fuck I\u2019m so dumb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it either until it was too late,\nthere\u2019s nothing we can do about it anyway. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>He left the highway at the exit leading towards the\nairport and parked the car at the first available spot.</p><p>The two of your rushed in and luckily found a hotspot\narea with computers and you quickly logged onto your email while Taehyung\nfrantically searched for tickets to purchase.</p><p>\u201cOur phones are out of order, please contact us on\nthis email as soon as you can!\u201d You sent.</p><p>\u201cPlease respond fast.\u201d You begged.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a flight to Vienna in four hours. Should I\nbook it?\u201d Taehyung asked, clearly distressed judging by the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s- Let\u2019s just wait five minutes in case he\nresponds and calm down, ok?\u201d</p><p>Five minutes felt like an hour and you impatiently\nrefreshed the page and to your relief you saw a response.</p><p>\u201cI just tried to call you. We tracked the location of\nthe text and it came from your house.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked over at your screen and read the email\nover and over again.</p><p>\u201cHow did he make it past the security gates? There are\nguards!\u201d</p><p>You exchanged brief eye contact with each other.</p><p>Vienna or going back and hoping he\u2019d still be there?</p><p>Taehyung leaned over to your side and clicked down the\nbrowser on the computer, stood up, grabbed your hand and ran back towards the\ncar, dragging you along.</p><p>The choice was made.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cHe could be waiting for us.\u201d Taehyung said, speeding.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gun hidden in the trunk, just in case; we\u2019ll\nuse that and end it once and for all.\u201d</p><p>You reached your neighborhood in no time and used your\nkey card to open the gate.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the guard?\u201d You questioned, looking\nout of the window.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stopped the car as the gate closed behind and\nquickly ran out to grab the gun from the trunk and took his seat behind the\nwheel again.</p><p>Everything seemed normal, even the atmosphere and no\ncar was parked near you house or on your driveway. The only car in sight was\nthe car parked in your neighbor\u2019s driveway.</p><p>Even the door to your house was locked.</p><p>Maybe he had just left? Or just roamed around the\noutside?</p><p>\u201cThis feels really weird\u2026\u201d Taehyung said in a low\nvoice, keeping you close by his arm around your waist.</p><p>He unlocked the door and pushed it open carefully.</p><p>Everything was still intact\u2026</p><p>But he had clearly been here? At least according to\nthe position of his location unless he had it hidden but then how on earth\nwould it show your house?</p><p>Nothing made sense!</p><p>You looked around the first level and Taehyung stopped\nyou by the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWait down here and I\u2019ll look upstairs.\u201d He handed you\nhis gun but you refused to take it.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you need it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re after you, not me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the gun.\u201d He said in a strict threatening tone.</p><p>The odd feeling came crawling and you felt more and\nmore of a bugging gut feeling.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d You said and ran out into the kitchen to grab\na knife.</p><p>\u201cAt least take this.\u201d</p><p>He took the knife from you and began walking upstairs.</p><p>Should you check the basement while he checked\nupstairs or stay?</p><p>The best would be if you had each other backs but he\nwas being so stubborn.</p><p>You looked around the living room. It was familiar to\nthe sight but unfamiliar to the feeling\u2026</p><p>The gun was held tight in your hands, unloaded as you\nwalked around the large space.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here\u2026 he\u2019s upstairs. Come out so we can\ntalk.\u201d You whispered and loaded your gun.</p><p>\u201cHow could you tell I was here honey?\u201d A voice\nsuddenly whispered, making you jump. You slapped your hand over your mouth to\nnot scream as you quickly turned around and spotted a dark dressed tall young\nman approaching you from his hiding.</p><p>His hair was short and black and he was strongly\nbuilt, if it wasn\u2019t for that he had threatened to kill the love of your life\nyou would\u2019ve admitted to him being attractive.</p><p>\u201cAre you Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>You aimed your gun at his forehead.</p><p>He scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI expected you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a few steps closer, clearly not intimidated by\nthe gun.</p><p>\u201cSay how much do you know about chemistry?\u201d He asked,\ntilting his head to the side and reaching into his pocket.</p><p>You took a step back.</p><p>What type of question was that?</p><p>Should you just shoot? Call out for Taehyung? For some\nreason your mind couldn\u2019t make a decision and Jungkook took yet another step\ncloser to you.</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to go with plan B.\u201d He muttered and\npulled out a cloth from his pocket.</p><p>He was too fast.</p><p>He grabbed the gun and aimed it away from him with\nstrong force and kicked your leg, tackling you to the ground with a loud sound,\nloud enough to alert Taehyung that something had happened. But before you knew\nit the room turned foggy and you lost consciousness.</p><p>The cloth was drenched in a strong odor, whatever it\nwas made you black out and within seconds Jungkook had your thrown over his\nshoulder and ran out to the car he had parked in the neighbor\u2019s driveway.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You woke up in a seated position, feeling drowsy to\nsay the least.</p><p>Heavy chains were holding you in place against the\nchair.</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re awake.\u201d </p><p>Not the voice you wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some water?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>The room was dark and you could tell where Jungkook was\nstanding but not much else.</p><p>Where were you?</p><p>You blinked a few times and your vision gradually\nbecame clearer.</p><p>It was a basement, clearly. A filthy basement with a\nbunch of newspapers scattered over the floor. In the corner of your eye you\ncould spot a dimly lit area with metal tables with some sort of chemistry\nequipment on\u2026 meth perhaps? Since he was also in the same circles?</p><p>Jungkook caught you looking over at the home lab.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much money I lost when the police\nconfiscated almost everything I had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He poked your shoulder hard.</p><p>\u201cThat guy you killed was my one employee; you couldn\u2019t\nhave picked another spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t, but I had him written as the person owning\nit to use him as my scape goat, I didn\u2019t care about him, but I cared about my\nshit that got taken away! I have people I need to deliver to! If I don\u2019t\ndeliver to them they send people like you on me!\u201d</p><p>Was he trying to make you feel bad for him? Because it\nwasn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent a message to your man by the way, who I\nhappen to know that you\u2019re dating because your webcam security is faulty as\nfuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>Oh gosh\u2026</p><p>\u201c100 million and he get you back, with almost no\nscratches\u2026\u201d He pulled out a pocket knife and stroked it against your cheek with\na wide smirk.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner he finds you, the less scratches\u2026 see it\nas a game.\u201d He folded the knife back and put it back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cHe has 42 minutes until the first one.\u201d He walked\naway and sat by the tables of the home lab corner.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Panic.</p><p>That was the only feeling mixed with rage that ran\nthrough his veins as he opened the safe in his office, taking all he could\ncarry from guns, diamonds worth more the ransom he asked for and an emergency\nphone he stored there\u2026 just in case.</p><p>He forwarded the email to the contact and immediately\ncalled him the second the phone turned on.</p><p>\u201cHey, I just read the email what the hell is going\non?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took her Jimin!\u201d He cried out. \u201cPlease just find\nhim\u2026 I\u2019m panicking.\u201d</p><p>Using your contact\u2019s name was something your tended to\navoid out of respect but Taehyung was desperate.</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on\u2026 took her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kidnapped her! He wants me to pay a ransom to get\nher back and then I\u2019m going to fucking kill him!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed everything with his free hand and shoved it\ninto a gym bag.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do this without you\u2026 You always made him\nstop and think clearly, being in this alone felt like a disorganized mess\u2026 this\nwas why he needed you, an \u201cassistant\u201d that he so happened to fall in love with\nupon first sight\u2026</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get on it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up!\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung rushed out to the car and tossed the bag onto\nthe passenger seat while listening to Jimin type away at his computer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd\u2026\u201d He pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t conceal his IP, I have the exact address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he\u2019s an idiot\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jimin gave him the address and Taehyung quickly put it\nin the navigator.</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes!?\u201d He snorted. \u201cI can make it in 15.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks Jimin.\u201d He sniffled, hung up and started the\ncar.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cThirteen minutes\u2026 what should I do with you huh?\u201d He\nslapped you across the face.</p><p>A few minutes ago you witnessed him take a dose of\nwhatever substance and it was clearly having an effect on him\u2026</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou have a nice face.\u201d He smirked and grabbed your\nchin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll save it for last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat old dude, he used to call me impatient\u2026 pffft,\nmaybe he was right\u2026\u201d</p><p>He disappeared behind you and returned with a flogger\nin his hands.</p><p>\u201c10 minutes princess, start praying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You kept the cold stare at him, refusing to show any\nexpression, neither fear or hope.</p><p>He was high out of his mind, eyes shot red.</p><p>\u201cDrugs are bad for you, you know that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting Stockholm Syndrome one me now? Why do\nyou care?\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone just keeps using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you use the guy we killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different!\u201d he pointed the flogger at you.</p><p>\u201cThe world owed me that one, I\u2019m still guilt free.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait this long.\u201d He complained.</p><p>To your surprise he took a seat sideways on your lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do besides killing people? Do you collect\nstamps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStamps?\u201d You gave him a judging look.</p><p>\u201cYeah, stamps.\u201d</p><p>He got back up again.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t make it either way.\u201d He groaned and raised\nhis arm.</p><p>You kept by your decision to not give him the\nreactions he wanted.</p><p>But it was hard.</p><p>As the sharp ends of the flogger slapped across your\nthighs you had to bite down on your lip hard to hold back.</p><p>Convincing yourself that you could withstand it was\npointless by the fifth time\u2026 he wanted to see blood and wounds and wouldn\u2019t\nstop until you were \u201cscratched.\u201d</p><p>By the eight he tossed the flogger on the floor and\nyou dared yourself to look down at your red, bleeding thighs.</p><p>The tights you were wearing were of course torn and\nripped by the sharp end in no time, leaving your skin exposed for the\nbrutality.</p><p>\u201cHe has 30 minutes till the next; I don\u2019t want to wait\nanother hour.\u201d He muttered and disappeared behind you again.</p><p>He returned with a glass of water and offered it to\nyou but you leaned away from it in rejection.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself then.\u201d He scoffed and took a seat on\nhis chair again.</p><p>\u201cDo you like crack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mess with drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung parked the car in front of a worn down house.\nThe neighborhood seemed to be gradually torn down as the space between each\nhouse was oddly large and looked somewhat like an abandoned construction site.</p><p>He took out a gun from the bag, concealed it by the\nhem of his jeans under his coat and grabbed a second in his hand. He shoved two\nof the diamonds he brought with him in his coat pocket, both of them neatly\nwrapped in a dark blue velvet boxes.</p><p>Taehyung walked up the door and had a quick listen\nbefore opening it. he wasn\u2019t surprised to find it unlocked.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You both heard sounds coming from upstairs.</p><p>\u201cIs he here?\u201d Jungkook questioned and stood up.</p><p>Your muscles relaxed slightly at the relief.</p><p>Jungkook had randomly showed you his tools as a sort\nof \u201centertainment\u201d, laughing at a screwdriver for an entire minute because it\nhad the word \u201cscrew\u201d in it\u2026</p><p>He took his knife out and your suspicion of him not\npossessing any actual weapons increased\u2026</p><p>You hoped Taehyung had a gun.</p><p>Where your gun from before had gone you had no clue of\nand it clearly wasn\u2019t around.</p><p>Maybe he was too much in a rush to kidnap you to think\nof grabbing the gun as well? Or it was waiting upstairs\u2026 Not knowing was\nprobably the worst.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung looked around the messy place before finding\nthe door leading to the staircase down into the basement. It felt like a likely\nplace\u2026</p><p>But before he could approach the door it swung open\nand he stood eye to eye with the face of his new enemy.</p><p>He immediately raised the gun.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the money?\u201d Jungkook asked, ignoring the\nweapon.</p><p>His nonchalant attitude was intimidating in its own\nway\u2026 may it be that he was high or that he had no fear but treated it like\ndust.</p><p>\u201cLet me see her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah, she\u2019s downstairs.\u201d He waved Taehyung\nalong.</p><p>By now he had noticed the red in his eyes.</p><p>He was making it too easy\u2026</p><p>Taehyung followed Jungkook down the stairs and the\nfirst thing he spotted was the small pool of blood beneath your legs, haven\ndripped from your thighs.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold back his gasp and his hands shook.</p><p>Before heading upstairs Jungkook had pulled a piece of\nfabric over your mouth tightly. But luckily it wasn\u2019t drenched in anything\u2026 but\nit was disgusting.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou took too long. Another minute and I would\u2019ve\npulled out her finger nails.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d Taehyung shoved his hand into his\npocket and pulled out one of the diamonds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth 173 million, it\u2019s more than you asked for\nbut I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted cash, not diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can trade it in for cash, idiot. I have another\nworth 246 if you want that one instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it\u2019s just glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and break it.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook took the box and opened it, taking out the\nclear cut jewel and throwing it against the concrete floor.</p><p>It slid across the floor, near you, still intact.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He muttered.</p><p>Taehyung loaded his gun with a click and pressed it\nunder Jungkook\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cNow un-tie her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know you want to kill me?\u201d He\nlaughed and pulled out the gun from before, concealed in the hem of his jeans.</p><p>Fuck\u2026</p><p>He aimed it back at Taehyung.</p><p>\u201cAfter all what I really wanted was you dead and\nasking her was just for fun\u2026 I wanted to see if she\u2019d actually do it.\u201d he threw\na glance towards you with a smirk.</p><p>Taehyung lowered his gun and fired it as his shoulder,\nmaking him lower his gun and wince in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with someone who\u2019s doing this for a\nliving.

For fun you could make yourself look extra\nnice today, because why not? You had the time to waste either way.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The sun had just begun to\nrise over the horizon when you arrived at the office building.

Well, his work of course.</p><p>It\u2019s complicated to describe\nfor a stranger but to put it simply\u2026 Taehyung was a hitman.</p><p>And you were his\n\u201dassistant\u201d.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t the most\nethical career choice but back then you were desperate for a source of income\nand why would you give up a pay that was enough for you to buy your own cars,\njewelry and designer shoes?</p><p>The question was why\nTaehyung insisted to get these things for you when he clearly knew you had\nmoney enough to get them yourself since he was the one actually paying you.</p><p>\u201dA surprise visit\u201d was a\ncode for a sudden last minute mission, or well, an assassination on short\nnotice\u2026</p><p>Before he had started the\ncar Taehyung handed you the files of the subject for you to look through while\nhe drove the two of you to the post office.</p><p>\u201dHome visit?\u201d You asked, skimming\nthrough the last page.</p><p>\u201dYes, he was supposed to\nreturn from a vacation in bora bora last night so hopefully he\u2019s jetlagged and\nasleep when we get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201dWho called for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201dSame as last time.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung had a couple of\nloyal clients\u2026</p><p>He pulled up in front of the\npost office and you hid the files in the glove compartment of the car.</p><p>The queue was short and you\ngot the package in no time.

As the only possible response to his cries you could\nfigure out was to pull him close again and crash your lips against his. You\nwhipped a tear away with your thumb and he looked into your eyes deeply before\nyou attacked his lips, giving him relief and reassurance.</p><p>He unbuckled his belt so he\ncould get closer and wrapped and arm around you and tangled the other in your\nhair, making sure you wouldn\u2019t pull away for however long he needed you.</p><p>He was calming down and his\nhand in your hair fell to your cheek instead, stroking over your skin softly.\nYour lips parted and he pressed his forehead against yours, catching his breath.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had to quit\nbecause my feelings for you were growing too strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just confess\nto me? I\u2019ve been hurting so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I was too afraid to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy sweetie? I\u2019ve done\neverything my confidence let me to hint to you how important you are for me,\nall the times I\u2019ve held your hand when we\u2019ve run away, when I protect you\u2026 I\nprotect you because I love you.\u201d</p><p>It was getting hard to hold\nback the tears now.</p><p>\u201cAm I dreaming now too?\u201d You\ncried.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is all real\nsweetie. Finally.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be.\u201d He kissed\nyour forehead. \u201cWe need each other, you and I.\u201d He moved your hair to behind\nyour ear.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d he asked\nbravely.</p><p>You hid your mouth behind\nyour hand and nodded, looking down.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He stroked your cheek again\nand you let go of each other. Taehyung put his seatbelt back on and returned to\nthe road carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you properly\nwhen we\u2019re back.\u201d He ensured.</p><p>The short ride remaining\nyour mind was pre-occupied replaying the scene you just experienced over and\nover again. The poison was even stronger than in the dream\u2026 You feelings were\nall over the place in a disorganized mess and all you knew was that you wanted\nhis touch back.</p><p>Taehyung parked the car\nbehind the building and got out, grabbed his bag from the back seat and the box\nfrom the trunk. You took the files with you and you walked towards the back\nentrance of the building. He put the box under his arm and grabbed your hand\nwith his free one.</p><p>Your heart was aching so bad\nit physically hurt.</p><p>Once you returned to the\noffice he put his bag down on the floor and the box as well and quickly walked\nover to his desk and knocked almost everything over.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He ordered and patted\nthe desk.</p><p>He grabbed the filed from\nyou and threw them on the floor, pushing you back to sit on his desk. He placed\nhis hands on your cheeks and stood between your thighs as he crashed his lips against\nyours and slipped his tongue in. Lust mixed with desperate desire.</p><p>His hands fell to your\nthighs and he leaned forward even closer, forcing you to wrap your arms around\nhim to not fall backwards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this for\nso long.\u201d He whispered between the heated kiss.</p><p>Your lust for him was\ngrowing stronger than ever and your hands grabbed onto his belt buckle, tugging\nat it and making you both open your eyes. Your lips parted, faces still closed\nand looking deeply into each other eyes.</p><p>He raised a brow in a\nquestioning expression.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d He asked,\nvoice low.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You confessed and\ncupped his cheek with your hand.</p><p>He moved fast.</p><p>Quickly unbuckled his belt\nand unzipped his jeans, pulling them down with a rough yanking motion along\nwith his boxer and freeing his dick. His hands slid up your thighs and moved\nyour dress up to your waist before he grabbed the sides of your panties and\npulled them down your legs.</p><p>His arms wrapped around your\nwaist and pulled you close and picked you up and he lied you down along the\nside of the desk on your back.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his\nhair.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have time?\u201d You\nasked, supporting yourself up on your elbow.</p><p>\u201cFor a quicky.\u201d</p><p>He hands grabbed your thigh\nand he bent down and without warning his lips touched your wetness and his\ntongue licked up your slit. He moved your thighs to his shoulders and held his\nbalance by holding on to the edge of the desk. You fell back against the hard\nwooden desk top and clenched your thighs tightly at the immense sensation he\nsent through you.</p><p>His lips sucked gently at\nyour clit before his tongue suddenly located you entrance and pushed through.\nIt didn\u2019t last long and he was hasty, he sucked gently at your clit and slipped\nin two fingers and thrusted them slowly.</p><p>\u201cI need to get you nice and\nwet first baby\u2026 I\u2019m quite thick.\u201d</p><p>His words were teasing all\nat its own.</p><p>\u201cI can take it! Please\njust-\u201c</p><p>He fingers left you and he\nstood back up properly, looking down at you with dark eyes.</p><p>He licked his fingers clean\nand placed his hands by your hips, moving them up along your outer thigh.</p><p>\u201cPut your legs over my\nshoulders.\u201d</p><p>You followed his lead and\nhis hands caressed your legs as he got closer.</p><p>You could feel hit tip\nbarely touching you until his hand guided himself between your slit.\nAnticipation mixed with need tortured you.</p><p>You moaned softly as you\nfelt his cock push through and stretch you out.</p><p>He bit his lower lip and\nslid in all the way.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d He\nsmirked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You chuckled almost a\nbit embarrassed, but you had to hurry up now.</p><p>He grip tightened and he\npulled back and thrusted back into you hard with a loud groan and picked up a\nfast pace.</p><p>\u201cNext time I promise this\nwill last for hours, I just want you so bad baby.\u201d He panted.</p><p>You grabbed on to the edges\nof the desk. He felt amazing and you didn\u2019t want it to ever end but you knew\nyou both had to release fast. </p><p>His hands fell to desk edge\nas well and he pushes your legs forward, going deeper and faster with heavy\ngrunts.</p><p>\u201cFuck! This is just like in\nmy dream.\u201d He moaned, followed by a sweet chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou dreamt of fucking me on\nyour desk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm, but this is so much\nbetter baby.\u201d He thrusted hard and deep, making you let out a surprised\nwhimper.</p><p>\u201cTell me when you\u2019re close\nbaby.\u201d He urged.</p><p>You reached down with one\nhand to play with your clit to help yourself get there faster but Taehyung\u2019s\nrough speed was almost enough to set you off on its own.</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d You pleaded and bit\nyour lip.</p><p>\u201cFuck you look so sexy\u2026 I\ncan\u2019t wait to see you naked.\u201d He panted and placed a kiss against your leg.</p><p>He whimpered, now chasing\nhis own high as time ran shorter and shorter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum.\u201d He called\nout and thrusted even deeper.</p><p>Your muscles were crying out\nfor relief through numb tingles and you rubbed your clit faster to catch up\nwith him and it got harder and harder to breathe properly and eventually you\njust held on to your own breath as you expected to break at any moment.</p><p>With a deep exhale mixed\nwith the tones of his sweet voice moaning out in pleasure you could feel him\nrelease his cum inside you as you climaxed. You core pulsated tightly and\nbefore you knew it he abruptly pulled out and pushed your legs off his shoulder\nand almost climbed up on the desk just to kiss you. You pushed yourself up to\nsitting to catch his need for kissing you and your lips crashed.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around\nyou and lifted you up to standing. Your legs were still shaken and weak and you\nlost your ability to stand and caught yourself by wrapping your arms around his\nneck, still not breaking the kiss.</p><p>A trail of his cum leaked\ndown your inner thigh.</p><p>Once you regained control\nover your legs you broke the kiss and quickly reached for your underwear to put\nthem back on while Taehyung did up his jeans and belt again. You pulled your\ndress back down over your hips and thighs and grabbed a tissue from the box on\nyour desk in your office and quickly whipped your thigh clean of his release.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d You called out,\nlooking at the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung unlocked his safe\nand handed you your gun and grabbed his own.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the strap.\u201d He said\nand tossed it to you.</p><p>You placed your gun on his\ndesk and quickly tied the strap around your thigh and attached the gun to it,\nthrowing the fabric of the dress down to conceal it.</p><p>You gathered together the\nfiles.</p><p>Taehyung hid his gun by his\nbelt and threw his long coat back on before grabbing yours and your hand and\nrunning out of the building.</p><p>\u201cHere, it\u2019s cold, don\u2019t get\nsick.\u201d He said and placed it over your shoulders for the short run to the car.</p><p>The stress was oddly\narousing and you finally took a seat in the car an hurried away towards your\nlocation.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cBrook Street then left.\u201d\nYou instructed, looking at the files.</p><p>Taehyung switched lanes and\nnoticed how you suddenly squirmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I can still feel\nyour cum leaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cLeft here. And just you\nwait till later\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me hard while\nI\u2019m driving, I don\u2019t want to show up with a throbbing erection.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you that sensitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you yeah. Now where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after this block.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You pulled up in a\nneighborhood of worn down looking houses. The entire block seemed to be in some\nserious need of restoration and renovation.</p><p>Your target lived in one of\nthe small apartment buildings and you quickly made your way over and inside.</p><p>\u201cThird floor, apartment\n1506\u201d you informed as you stepped inside the elevator.</p><p>This was an easy mission\ncompared to what you had have in past.</p><p>Sometimes, in worse cases\npeople had been expecting you and caused it to quickly turn ugly.</p><p>The elevator dinged and you\nand Taehyung stepped out on the third floor and found the right apartment.</p><p>Taehyung pulled his gun out\nand loaded it and hid against the wall right next to the door while you\nknocked.</p><p>It took a few knocking\nattempts until you finally heard someone approach the door from inside.</p><p>A large, annoyed looking man\nopened the door with sleepy eyes. Once he saw you he eyes you up and down in\nyour dress and open coat and looked confused but pleased.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a bathtub?\u201d You\nasked, trying to sound anxious.</p><p>\u201cI so happen to, how come?\u201d</p><p>The click from Taehyung\u2019s\ngun made him freeze as the gun was suddenly aimed at his head.</p><p>You smirked.</p><p>\u201cGet in the tub.\u201d Taehyung\nordered and you both back him inside and closed the door behind.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the tub.\u201d Taehyung\nsaid, more aggressive and poked the gun at his head.</p><p>As you entered the bathroom\nyou threw a quick glance into the apartment and saw the dirty looking at home\nlab in the living room. Did he create drugs of some sort?</p><p>It was none of your\nbusiness, you were here to do your job but it was always curious to know what\nthe causes of these hits were.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scaring me if\nthat\u2019s what you\u2019re here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d You ordered.</p><p>\u201cShut up bitch.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung lowered his gun and\nshot him in the foot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you say\nto her?\u201d</p><p>The man bent down in pain\nand screamed and you pushed him into the bathtub.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it personal.\u201d\nTaehyung threatened and aimed the gun at his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me!?\nI don\u2019t have anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of our\nbusiness, someone just sent us here to wish you good night that\u2019s all.\u201d You\nsmiled.</p><p>He looked confused and a\nsecond later Taehyung pulled the trigger.</p><p>The job was done.</p><p>You pulled out a zip lock\nbag from your bag with a gun and a note in it and Taehyung put on his black\nleather gloves that were in his coat pocket and secured his own gun at his belt\nagain.</p><p>He took the bag from you and\nmade sure to cover the gun with plenty of the man\u2019s own finger prints just as\nwith the note before placing the note in the sink and placing the gun in the\nman\u2019s hand.</p><p>He shoved the zip lock bag\nin his pocket, removed his gloves and grabbed your hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Making it look like\nsomething it wasn\u2019t was something you charged heavily extra for, but what the\nclient wants and pays for, the client gets.</p><p>You set the door to lock\nitself when you left and you got back to the car.</p><p>Taehyung opened the back\ntrunk and inside were two shoe boxes.</p><p>You lifted one of your legs\nup to take your shoe off but Taehyung stopped you.</p><p>\u201cHoney no, sit in the\nbackseat so you don\u2019t have to touch the ground.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t really mind but\nwent to open the back seat door anyway and took a seat sideways so your feet\nwere out of the car.</p><p>After each mission you had\nlike a tradition to always burn your shoes, the only pity was that the shoes\nyou burned were always so expensive. You once suggested for Taehyung that you\nshould get cheap shoes to wear for missions and burn but he refused.</p><p>You had dismissed the\nthought in the past that maybe he enjoyed buying you expensive shoes, and\nburning them was an excuse to buy more as well as wiping away your traces\u2026 but\nhe never said anything about it.</p><p>Before you had the chance to\nkick off your sparkly heels Taehyung rushed over to you and put the shoe box on\nyour lap and bent down. He grabbed your right ankle and slipped the shoe off\nand repeated the same move with your left.</p><p>You opened the box for him\nand to your surprise there were a pair of black Louboutin pumps inside.</p><p>\u201cI thought they\u2019ll look good\non you.\u201d He confessed shyly and took one on of the shoes.</p><p>\u201cAll shoes you pick do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and looked down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like them.\u201d</p><p>He slipped the shoe on and\nyou giggled, feeling almost like Cinderella.</p><p>Taehyung grabbed the other\nshoe and slipped it on as well.</p><p>\u201cAre they comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey feel good.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stood back up and\ngrabbed your old Jimmy Choo\u2019s and placed them in the box for you. You moved the\nbox off your lap and into the seat behind you and Taehyung held out a hand to\nhelp you up and out of the car.</p><p>They were beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI know you should never buy\nshoes for a love because the soles wear out, but they never get the chance to\nsince we burn them.\u201d He smiled proudly and closed the door behind him.</p><p>He quickly changed his own\nshoes, getting out of his shiny Dior shoes and into a brown pair of loafers.</p><p>\u201cGucci?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>He closed the trunk and you\nboth got back into the car.</p><p>\u201cWe have dinner left on our\nschedule.\u201d You pointed out once he started the car.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d</p><p>He smiled his wide smile\nthat had your heart melting.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a place in mind.\u201d He\nsaid mysteriously and tapped the screen display in the car to call.</p><p>The person that picked up\nvoiced a short hello.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>You took a short detour back\nto the office and picked up your things and the parcel from earlier before\nheading to dinner.</p><p>Taehyung drove a somewhat\nfamiliar route before stopping by a gate into a gated community of large lavish\nhouses.</p><p>You remembered very well\nthat Taehyung lived here.</p><p>In his backyard was a cozy\nfire pit and that\u2019s where you\u2019d burn your shoes.</p><p>\u201cAre we burning the shoes\nfirst?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to\u2026 We\u2019re\nhaving dinner at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to cook for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d You\nconfessed shyly.</p><p>This warm domestic side was\nsomething you would never get tired of seeing and now when he was finally\nyours\u2026 you could see his warm smile whenever, his heart finally at ease and\nburning with a new type of fire.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The sun was setting and\nTaehyung threw a few more logs into the fire followed by you tossing your shoes\ninto the fire. You reached down and picked his Diors up and tossed them into\nthe fire as well.</p><p>You had never really had the\nchance to properly explore his large house.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a house\ntour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never explored, I\u2019ve\nnever seen your room or the upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He looked surprised.</p><p>You pulled the blanket over\nyour shoulders tighter around you and nodded.</p><p>He put an arm around you and\nwalked you back inside through the large terrace doors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much too see but-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI doubt it! I want to see\nyour closet too, you always dress so nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He giggled.</p><p>You left the blanket on the\nsofa in the living room downstairs and ran up the stairs before Taehyung.</p><p>The first door led into a\nlarge master bedroom with a huge bed made neatly with decorative pillows.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but I never sleep in\nit.\u201d Taehyung said, catching up to you.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bed is too big. It\nmakes me feel lonely.\u201d</p><p>You looked at him with\npitiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d say that.\u201d He\nleaned in and kissed you softly.</p><p>You could say that\u2019s where\nit all started a few months ago\u2026</p><p>When everything finally\nchanged.</p><p>Oh yeah, the package!</p><p>It did contain diamonds like\nhe said\u2026 but in form of a dainty choker, made for you.</p><p>The entire piece was lined\nwith tiny diamonds and you didn\u2019t dare consider what it could possibly be\nworth. Another of his expensive gifts in a desperate attempt to charm you, when\nhe had already been successful in doing so\u2026</p><p>\u2013</p><p>His sleepy\nvoice was deep and raspy, making you almost shiver when he whispered in your\near.</p><p>Taehyung\nwas cuddled up tightly against your body from behind, spooning you with a\nstrong arm wrapped snug around your waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d\nHe pouted and nuzzled the back of your neck gently.</p><p>\u201cPut\nsomething on.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be a\nlot warmer if he just wore pajamas instead of getting right into bed fully\nnude\u2026</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d </p><p>You giggled\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cThen\nyou\u2019ll have to hug me harder.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed\nyou and you made a playful suffocating sound, making him chuckle.</p><p>He hummed\nsoftly and his grip loosened and he placed his hand on your hip, by the hem of\nyou pajama shorts.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nwhat I mean.\u201d He whispered, sounding pleading.</p><p>He pulled\nyour shorts down over your hip slowly and of course you had suspected his hint\neven before that but it was fun to play games with his needs sometimes.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d\nhis tone was sultry and you bit your lip as he continued sliding your shorts\ndown your thighs.</p><p>You hummed\na yes and kicked your shorts of the remaining way under the covers and Taehyung\nmoved even closer, pressing his hips against your butt. He quickly reached over\nyou for the tiny bottle of lube conveniently placed on your nightstand table\nand coated his cock with a few drops before throwing the bottle on the floor.\nHe pulled you back by the hips, positioning you in a pose that would make it\neasier for him to slide in.</p><p>The covers\nruffled softly from all the movement and suddenly you felt the tip of his cock\ndrag between your lower lips before pushing through. He let out a short low\ngroan and positioned himself by your entrance before thrusting into you\ncarefully. His thickness stretched you out slightly and the position you were\nin with your thighs clenched together made it feel like an even tighter fit.</p><p>He pushed\nin deep and pulled you back even more to take more of his cock. His arm\nreturned to your waist and he exhaled deeply with a soft moan and rested his\nhead against the pillow; his deep breathing tickled the back of your neck and\neventually you drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Having his\ncock inside you like that was something you both loved. In some way it was cozy\nand comfortable, but an intimate version of being so. Softly clenching around\nhim and feeling yourself get almost incredibly wet from just his still presence\nwas amazing. Sometimes the two of you grew so horny it just became impossible\nto feel asleep that way and you ended up fucking instead and then passing out\nto sleep from exhaustion; Also a great outcome.</p><p>The worst\npart for both of you was when he had to pull out or if he accidently slipped\nout during your sleep. At one time he had cum in his sleep from a dream and\nwhen he pulled out a trail of his cum leaked down your thighs.</p><p>You thought\nit was funny, but Taehyung was embarrassed.</p><p>The last\nthing you felt before falling asleep were his soft lips pressing delicately\nagainst your neck, giving you a gentle kiss good night.</p><p>You moved in with him not\ntoo long ago and you finally made use of his large comfortable bed for more\nthan just sleeping.</p><p>Your old penthouse apartment\nwas up for sale and you were glad you got the chance to invite Taehyung over to\nyour place a few times before he begged you to move in with him.</p><p>Well, a few might sounds\nless than it was but having him stay the night hugging you from behind, his\nnude skin against yours\u2026 was something you wouldn\u2019t give up for the world,\nespecially not after sex.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t get enough of\neach other.</p><p>Almost every night one of\nyou made the other scream out in pleasure.</p><p>There was no shame.</p><p>Some days you\u2019d wake him up\nunder the sheets by sucking him off and other days he\u2019d tickle your clit to\nwake you up and fuck you before breakfast. There was no end to it. You lust for\neach other was stronger than any force.</p><p>The office, the car, every\nroom of the house\u2026 once even at the very end of a mission.</p><p>May that have been\ncontroversial\u2026 but something came over both of you that day while still wearing\nyour soon to be burned shoes\u2026</p><p>\u2013</p><p>That night you woke up\nbriefly by soft whimpers coming from your love behind you. His cock was on the\nvery edge of slipping out of your heat and it was a teasing sensation, you\nwanted him deep and right where he was, was dangerously close to one of your sweet\nspots. You wiggled your hips carefully and caused him to slip out fully for\nyour own relief and fell back to sleep.</p><p>A couple of hours later you\nwoke up first and carefully moved out of his hold to lie on your stomach beside\nhim to half-sleep until he would wake up.</p><p>He was breathing softly next\nto you and you couldn\u2019t help but admire this sleeping beauty.</p><p>He blinked a few times and finally woke\nup, stretching out his lean arms with a groan.<br>\nHe eyed you up and down as you lied on your stomach next to him and his tongue\nlicked across his lip. </p><p>\u201cNice view to wake up to.\u201d He said,\nadmiring your naked body with a smirk. </p><p>You smiled and leaned close to kiss his\nsoft lips good morning.<br>\n\u201cCome here baby.\u201d He begged and sat up, leaning against the head board with one\narm resting on top of it as he patted on his thigh for you to come sit.<br>\nYou moved your leg over and straddled him, his hands landing on your lower\nback, stroking up and down as you leaned closer to him. </p><p><br>\n\u201cWhat were you dreaming about?\u201d You asked.<br>\n\u201cOh\u2026 I don\u2019t remember.\u201d <br>\n\u201cYou were whimpering in your sleep.\u201d You teased, making him giggle in\nembarrassment.<br>\nHe pushed against your back, making you press tight against him so his mouth\nwas right by your ear.<br>\n\u201cI dreamt\u2026\u201d He whispered. \u201cThat I was fucking your tight little pussy with my\ncock\u2026 Hard\u2026 And you had your hands\u2026\u201d He grabbed your hands, placing them on his\nchest. \u201cHere\u2026 While I was pounding into you, making you scream for more than\nyou could handle.\u201d He nibbled at your earlobe gently.</p><p><br>\nHis story definitely tied a knot within you. <br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so needy for you baby\u2026\u201d He said sultry and twirled and strand of your hair.<br>\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that Mr. Kim.\u201d You grinned and looked down, seeing how his\nmorning wood had developed into a full hard erection, thick and likely\nthrobbing. <br>\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d He begged, biting down on his lip as his hand moved down to your\nbutt.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been such a good girl lately\u2026.\u201d<br>\nA good girl?<br>\nYou smirked and jumped off of him and got down from the bed.<br>\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He asked in a serious concerned tone.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m having a shower, what are you waiting for?\u201d You smirked and curled your\nfingers in a come here motion as you headed towards the bathroom.<br>\nYou heard the rustle of the sheets behind you and the sound of his feet\ntouching the floor.</p><p>You entered the bathroom, Taehyung\nfollowing behind and you stepped into the spacious rain shower together.</p><p><br>\nThe water started falling over the two of you.<br>\nTaehyung grabbed your hips and pressed himself close against your butt, his\ncock rubbing against you cheek.<br>\n\u201cBaby\u2026I want you so bad right now.\u201d He groaned. You pressed your butt against\nhim firmer, wanting to tease him.<br>\nGood girl? Tsk\u2026\u00a0</p><p><br>\nYou turned around and looked into his dark eyes filled with lust and his lips\nparted slightly. </p><p>His hands were already all over your\nbody, caressing and tracing your every curve.<br>\nYou placed a finger under his chin and pressed your lips against his. He\npressed you closer to his wet body and desperately tried to deepen the kiss,\nbut you wouldn\u2019t let him. </p><p>You bit down gently on his lip and\npulled away.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d He panted, leaning in to suck on your neck but you backed away.<br>\nHe stared at you intensely as you grabbed the shower gel and poured a generous\namount over your breasts and started to lather in your entire body.\u00a0<br>\nTaehyung leaned back against the tiles, his hand wrapped tight around his\nshaft. <br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201c he pleaded, eyes not leaving your body for a mere\nsecond.</p><p><br>\nYou let the soap wash off your body and continued moving your hands over your\nbody. You slipped your hand down between your folds and swirled a circle over\nyour clit.<br>\n\"Ah\u2026 Taehyung\u2026\u201d You moaned, knowing this would make him mad. </p><p>He didn\u2019t like it when you touched\nyourself, especially not when he was rock hard and needy for you.</p><p><br>\nJust a second later you were impatiently pushed against the cold tiles in the\nshower, your breasts squeezed against the wall and with Taehyung\u2019s hands on\nyour hips. <br>\n\u201cWhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He asked with his mouth right by\nyour ear. </p><p>\u201cYou know what that does to me.\u201d His\ntone was angry.<br>\n\u201cNow let me fuck you like the good girl you are before I punish you like the\nbad girl you\u2019re trying to be.\u201d<br>\nYou nodded. <br>\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d<br>\nHis hand slid down the outside of your thighs as he squatted down behind you.<br>\nHe parted your lower lips with his fingers and didn\u2019t hesitate before pushing\ntwo of them in. You bit down on your lip and suppressed a moan as he roughly\nthrusted his fingers in and out, the only reason being to stretch you out for\nhim.<br>\nHe curled his fingers inside you causing you to clench lightly around them and\nhe pulled out.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re ready, bend down.\u201d He ordered and you did as told, more than ready to\nscream his name.</p><p><br>\nAs you bent down you looked over your shoulder, seeing his cock throb in his\nhand as it slid up and down with pre-cum dripping from the tip.<br>\nHe placed a hand on your butt cheek and dragged his cock up and down your slit.<br>\nHe placed his tip by your entrance and slowly began pushing himself in, groans\nescaping his mouth and yours as he stretched you out even more.</p><p><br>\n\u201cFuck you\u2019re still too tight.\u201d He whined and pulled out.<br>\n\u201cI can take it!\u201d You yelled, desperate for him to keep going.<br>\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked, the sweet tone suddenly returning.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sure! Just fuck me!\u201d You yelled, feeling your walls pulsating, desperate\nfor him.<br>\nHe began pushing himself into you again, groaning immensely as he slipped in\nall the way, making you moan loud followed by a deep exhale.<br>\nHe caressed your right butt cheek, staying still inside you, allowing you the\ntime to adjust.</p><p><br>\nA little whimper from you and he began to pull out and thrusted back in slowly.<br>\n\u201cFaster.\u201d You panted. </p><p>He increased his speed slightly but it\ndidn\u2019t last for long before he gave into his own need and began pounding into\nyou fast and hard, the two of you becoming a moaning mess.<br>\nTaehyung\u2019s grip on your hips tightened, signaling that he was close.<br>\n\u201cFuck\u201d he grunted and thrusted harder, hitting you to the limit.<br>\n\u201cTae- I-I\u2019m gonna-\u201d you panted and he thrusted faster.<br>\n\u201cYeah baby.\u201d He panted.<br>\nA few more thrusts and he pushed himself in deep and hard making your orgasm\nhit you hard and clench tightly around him, making him cum hard with a grunt.</p><p>You breathed heavily as he carefully\npulled out of you, some of his cum leaking out as he did.<br>\nHe hastily wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled your back up against\nhim and kissed your cheek.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d He whispered and chuckled lightly.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You typed away at the computer in your\noffice, checking the website you ran for the business and updated the filter to\nkeep out any \u201cunserious\u201d clients.</p><p>Of course the website wasn\u2019t something\nyou could simply google.</p><p>If you knew the url it would quickly\nbecome unusable as you changed the name of the website frequently as well as\nthe contact email.</p><p>\u201cSweetie?\u201d Taehyung suddenly called.</p><p>You stood up from your seat and walked\ninto his office. He was leaned forward at his laptop on his desk with a\nthoughtful expression.</p><p>As you walked up to him you stroked your\nhand over his shoulder before wrapping your arms around his neck and leaning\ndown by the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese or these?\u201d He moved the tiny\narrow on the screen around a pair of shoes and then clicked another tab and\nshowed another pair of shoes.</p><p>\u201cMission or leisure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeisure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the first ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want matching ones?\u201d He asked\nshyly, turning to his side to look at you.</p><p>\u201cAre there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>\u201cNot exactly the same, but I found a\npair of heels that were in similar style.\u201d He clicked them up to show you the beautiful\nheels.</p><p>\u201cYou really like it when I wear heels\nhuh?\u201d You giggled.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He kissed your cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re conveniently here I need\nyou to have a look at this email.\u201d </p><p>Taehyung quickly searched up the email\nin the inbox and opened it for you to read.</p><p>-No subject.-</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to be a joke?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI thought the same. I\u2019m changing the\nemail just in case though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell me when you have so I can update\nit on the page, I just changed the url of it.\u201d</p><p>You stood up straight and caressed his\nneck before abandoning him of your touch.</p><p>Before you managed to take a second step\ntowards your office your wrist was grabbed and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung moved his chair back from his\ndesk slightly and patted his lap with his other hand.</p><p>Just for a short while\u2026 you thought and\nwalked over to sit on his thighs.</p><p>\u201cCan you work like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can.\u201d He said and rested\nhis chin on your shoulder and reached for his computer with one arm on either\nside of you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the way.\u201d You laughed and moved\nto get back off but his arms quickly wrapped around your waist, stopping you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed you tightly around the hips\nand pulled you back against him properly so you were sitting over his crotch,\nwhere he wanted you.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t sit still, but stay.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>He ignored his work and began kissing\nyour neck softly.</p><p>You held on to the arm rests carefully\nand moved your hips in a slow teasing motion.</p><p>\u201cJust like that baby.\u201d He whispered,\nsatisfied by the gentle friction.</p><p>\u201cCan you wear the diamond necklace for\nme tonight? You haven\u2019t worn it since I got it for you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s precious to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I know you ah- yes right there baby\u2026\nIf I know you right, you\u2019re afraid to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s real diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd diamonds are replaceable. If anything\nhappens to it I\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201d </p><p>You could feel his hard on growing\nbetween his thighs and you grinded against him a little harder. His hands moved\nto your hips to control your movements but to your surprise he stopped you.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d </p><p>You looked at the time on the corner of\nhis laptop.</p><p>\u201cAlmost five.\u201d</p><p>He patted your thigh two times.</p><p>\u201cThe jewelry shop closes soon, we can\nmake it if we hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait why are we going there now?\u201d You\nasked confused and got up.</p><p>\u201cI want to buy you more diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung no.:\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d He said and got up\nfrom his chair. \u201cGet your coat, it\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>You stopped him in his steps by grabbing\nhis arms.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>You pointed down, trying to suffocate a\ngiggle.</p><p>He looked down at his bulge straining\nagainst his jeans.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Driving slightly over the speed limit\nyou made it to the shop right on time just before closing.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t given up on trying to talking\nhim out of getting you more expensive stuff yet, but you were near to. He was\nso stubborn and claimed that you\u2019d be more comfortable wearing the diamonds if\nyou had more of them which certainly wasn\u2019t true. But if it made him happy\u2026 </p><p>You sighed.</p><p>Taehyung immediately walked over to the\ndisplays of necklaces but your attention was caught by a pair of dainty\nearrings in one of the glass cabinets.</p><p>It seemed to be part of a collection as\nit was displayed next to a necklace, bracelet and ring in similar style. You\nlooked at the ring for a while and quickly shook off the feeling it gave you\nand moved on to the next display.</p><p>On dark blue velvet were a pair of\nsilver platted cufflinks and they immediately caught your liking.</p><p>They were expensive and you recognized\nthe luxury brand labelled next the price, but as someone who was paid well and\nwithout taxes you could afford to splurge on something for Taehyung\u2026 if he now\ninsisted on getting you something you could insist on getting him something as\nwell.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you Madame?\u201d A voice\nsuddenly asked behind you.</p><p>The name tag on the right side of his\nchest made it obvious that he worked in the shop and in regards of the dream\nyou had long ago, he was fairly young to your relief.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to buy these.\u201d You smiled\nand pointed towards the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cExcellent choice, they\u2019re from the\nnewest collection too. We received it last week.\u201d He smiled and grabbed the key\nto the cabinet hung on his belt.</p><p>Taehyung turned around and looked at you\nwith an odd look before making his way over.</p><p>\u201cDid you find something?\u201d</p><p>You nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cNot for me though.\u201d</p><p>The employee carefully picked up the\ncufflinks and locked the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back with the box.\u201d He\nsaid and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWho are you getting them for?\u201d He asked\nin a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cFor you of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me.\u201d You teased with a\nsmile. \u201cI found something I like for myself as well though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe earrings.\u201d You said and pointed\ntowards them behind the glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Only them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me everything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else? Bracelets? Rings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRings?\u201d You giggled.</p><p>His cheeks went red but his serious\nexpression remained.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung you don\u2019t need to get me\neverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>The young employee returned with the\ncufflinks in a dark blue velvet box and wrapped it up neatly in a paper bag.</p><p>You walked over to the counter and paid\nfor the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d you smiled and took the\nbag.</p><p>While Taehyung received help getting the\nearrings you looked around in the rest of the shop. You spotted a pearl\nnecklace, it could be a choker as well but it was hard to tell from the way it\nwas displayed. Taehyung would look good in pearls\u2026</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d Taehyung suddenly asked\nwith a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, are you done?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI got you a bracelet too.\u201d</p><p>You looked down in defeat and took his\nhand in yours and you left the store.</p><p>The street outside was oddly calm and\nyou glanced around and saw a clothing shop and a hardware store further down the\nstreet.</p><p>\u201cOh that reminds me! Can we go to the\nhardware store quickly?\u201d Taehyung suddenly asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some basic tools.\u201d</p><p>You headed towards the hardware store\nthat was luckily open till later and found a basic tool box. Taehyung went to\nlook for a saw quickly and you walked up and down a random aisle and found\nvarious ropes. You felt one of them and the texture was strong and straw like.</p><p>A member of staff walked down the aisle\nand you quickly grabbed her attention.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, can I get three meters of\nthis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She smiled and grabbed a\nmeasuring tape from her pocket and began to measure out the length of the rope\nbefore cutting it off and rolling it up for you.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cRope?\u201d Taehyung questioned as he joined\nyou in the line to pay.</p><p>\u201cDid you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but why are you getting rope?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor fun.\u201d You smirked.</p><p>\u201cThe same fun why I need these tools?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>You walked back to the car with all your\nstuff and finally headed back home.</p><p>You knew why he needed the tools\u2026 your\nnext mission meant the two of you had to go somewhat undercover\u2026</p><p>He parked the car outside the house and\nyou brought everything inside.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you.\u201d You smiled and handed\nTaehyung the bag from jewelry shop.</p><p>He eagerly opened it, excited to have a\ncloser look at the cufflinks.</p><p>\u201cThank you baby.\u201d He smiled shyly and\ngave you a soft kiss.</p><p>\u201cI got something for you too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you!?\u201d You acted surprised, making\nyou both giggle.</p><p>The bracelet matched the earrings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing these tonight.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>You had a table booked at one of the\nfancier restaurants in town tonight, for date-night</p><p>After a refreshing shower you touched up\nyour makeup and got into a black fitted, shape flattering dress paired with the\ndiamond choker necklace and the dainty earrings. Taehyung wore a white shirt,\nwithout a crease to be seen and the cufflinks decorating the end of his sleeves\nwith a sparkle of shine. Paired with it were a pair of black slacks, black belt\nwith a silver buckle in the same tone as the cufflinks and a pair of dark red\nvelvet loafers.</p><p>Hand in hand looking expensive\u2026 there\nwas something about it that made you smile. Was this what power felt like?\nConfidence? The fact that you were wearing multiple tiny diamonds around your\nneck probably worth more than a few cars?</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d He smirked,\nadmiring you while lifting his glass to take a sip.</p><p>His gaze was burning in a way that made\nyou feel like he was eating you rather than the food.</p><p>\u201cIf only you knew what I had planned\nlater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanned?\u201d he looked intrigued. </p><p>\u201cTell me more\u201d</p><p>You slowly traced your fingers up and\ndown the thin stem of your glass.</p><p>Soft jazzy lounge music was surrounding\nyou.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about\nroleplaying?\u201d You said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cRoleplaying? Like police officer or maid\ntype roleplay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of\u2026 but I was thinking more of a\nhostage situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take you hostage?\u201d He\nsmirked.</p><p>Oh how wrong he was\u2026</p><p>You lifted your glass to your lips and\nleft him unanswered.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung took your coat for you and hung\nit up together with his own once you got back home.</p><p>Once he turned back around you grabbed\nthe collar of his shirt and kissed him roughly. </p><p>Before he could react you had already\npulled away.</p><p>His hands landed on your hips.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs, get undressed and wait on\nthe chair in the bedroom.\u201d You ordered.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret it. You\u2019re my hostage\nnow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me waiting too long.\u201d He\nsmirked and broke free from your hold and headed towards the stairs,\nunbuttoning his shirt at the same time.</p><p>You had placed the chair in the middle\nof the bedroom right before you left for the restaurant.</p><p>It was your turn to have some fun.</p><p>You pulled your dress over your head,\nrevealing the black lace body you were wearing underneath and hung it over the\nstaircase the railing as you walked up.</p><p>In Taehyung\u2019s office stood the bag from\nthe hardware store and you pulled out the rope before making your way to the\nbedroom.</p><p>Taehyung was leaned back against the\nchair with one arm over his waist as he stroked his cock slowly.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and stop touching\nyourself.\u201d You ordered, hiding the rope behind your back.</p><p>He did as told and hid his smirk behind\nhis long fingers that caressed his lips.</p><p>\u201cSit properly.\u201d</p><p>He sat up with his back to the backrest\nand you pulled the rope around him.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>You wrapped it around him twice,\nsecuring his arms to his sides and tied it behind.</p><p>You dragged your hand along his jaw as\nyou walked to stand in front of him and then placed them firmly against his\nthighs.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>You moved your hands further up his\ntoned thighs and he opened his eyes.</p><p>At the sight of your outfit a wide smirk\nspread across his face and he poked his cheek with his tongue. He looked down\nat the rope around his body, his erection and your hands and back to your face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>You spread his thighs apart and took a\nseat on his left one, crossing a leg over your other and rested your arm\nagainst his shoulder, grabbing his earlobe.</p><p>\u201cYou have adorable ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do to me?\u201d he asked\nagain.</p><p>You caressed his jaw and tilted his face\nto your side and leaned in towards his lips, leaving little to no space\nbetween. He leaned forward and you backed slightly, making him lean forward\neven more, desperate for your kiss until the rope held him back and his arms\nstrained against it.</p><p>You giggled.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019d do if I got out of\nthese ropes huh?\u201d He asked in a cocky threatening tone.</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the head of\nhis cock and let him slide through your tight grip, making him whimper loudly.</p><p>\u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>You let go of him, starting your build\nup for his desperation.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to be a bit\ndisciplined.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close again, brushing his nose\nagainst your cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me beg for you?\u201d\nHe whispered sultry.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d You grabbed his neck with\none hand and pushed him back.</p><p>His fringe barely covered his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it was for me to\nhold back earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did.\u201d You let your hand\nslide down his neck to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI already have a build-up, be nice.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the head of his cock again\nand slid your hand off it, making him lean his head back and whimper once more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby- please\u2026 please be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>You got off his thigh and hunched down\nbetween his thighs and placed a soft his against the tip of his sensitive cock\nbefore swirling your tongue around it. He leaned his head back, giving you a\nview of his thick neck.</p><p>You moved your hair to the side and took\noff your diamond choker and stood back up.</p><p>\u201cIt would look good on you.\u201d You smirked\nand straddled his thigh as you put the choker around his neck.</p><p>You placed two fingers under his chin\nand leaned in to kiss him, finally giving him what he wanted.</p><p>You slipped your tongue in, immediately\nclaiming dominance of the kiss before tangling your hands in his hair and\ntugging at it gently.</p><p>One of your hands fell to his neck\ninstead and stroked down his chest and abdomen to the base of his cock. You\nwrapped your hand around his thick shaft and began jerking him off, making him\nmoan against the kiss.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna cum for me?\u201d You\nwhispered, briefly pulling away from the kiss and suffocating his response with\nyour lips and tongue, making him only possible to give out a long whimper in\nrhythm with your hand\u2019s movements.</p><p>His whimpers grew more frequent and you\ncaressed his tip with your thumb.</p><p>He was breathing heavily and you pulled\naway from the kiss to allow him to catch his breath and hear his sweet moans as\nyou jerked him off faster. He leaned his head back and cursed and you moved\nyour hand from his hair to his neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u201d</p><p>You pulled your hand away.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! Please don\u2019t stop!\u201d He squirmed.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Ah- Fuck!\u201d His breathing got\nheavier and his thigh quivered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me cum!\u201d</p><p>You ignored his begging and stood up and\ntook a step back to stand in front of him as you reached for the shoulder of\nyour lace body and slipped it down.</p><p>His breathing was calming down and his\nhead leaned down and he looked up at you with an intimidating frown.</p><p>Small bead of sweat had formed by his\nchest, making his skin glow.</p><p>You slipped the other side down your\nshoulder and pulled the lace down to your waist, exposing your breasts. You\nwalked over to your nightstand table, out of Taehyung\u2019s view and grabbed a hair\ntie to tie up your hair.</p><p>When you returned to him you took a seat\non your knees between his legs.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard I\u2019m going to fuck\nyou for that?\u201d He muttered.</p><p>You flicked your finger across his tip\nand he winced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lay you across my lap and\nspank you until you beg for my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>\u201cI dare you to do your worst baby\u2026\nJust know I\u2019ll get you back for it\u201d</p><p>You snorted and rolled your eyes at him.\nA mere second later he bit his lip hard as you grabbed his aching cock and\nswirled your tongue around the tip.</p><p>You took his head into your mouth and\nsucked gently and he hummed in pleasure, leaning his head back.</p><p>\u201cDo I taste good baby?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>His bratty attitude was becoming more\nand more of a burden\u2026</p><p>You pulled him out of your mouth and\nstood back up with a serious expression.</p><p>His gaze travelled up your entire body,\nadmiring the view as you took off the lace completely, leaving you fully nude.</p><p>You sat down on his thigh again and\ntangled one hand in his hair, pushing his head away from you to stretch out his\nneck before your lips attacked it, right above the diamonds that decorated him.\nWith your other hand your swirled you finger around his tip. He inhaled sharply\nand you let out a low long whimper by his neck, knowing it would drive him\ncrazy.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026\u201d</p><p>You got up without breaking your touch\nand straddled his thigh and started to grind down on him. Moving back and\nforth, creating friction for yourself that made your desire and arousal grow\nworse. You let out another moan and lowered your hand in a fist over his cock\nand jerked him off teasingly slow. </p><p>Holding your balance was a struggle so\nyou got up and let go of his cock instead and he looked disappointed till you\npushed his thighs closer together and straddled him properly over his hips.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d He smirked, hoping you\u2019d finally\nride him.</p><p>You put your hands on his neck and\ncrashed your lips against his. You could feel his cock throb by your thigh and\nhe strained against the ropes, pointlessly trying to get closer to you.</p><p>He leaned his head back and managed to\nbreak the kiss, slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cPlease touch me.\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cBaby please, I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me that bad?\u201d You caressed his\ncheek.</p><p>\u201cI always want you! I want you so\nfucking bad! But I\u2019m gonna go crazy if you either don\u2019t remove these ropes so I\ncan push you down onto my cock myself or if you ride me baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my hostage; I\u2019m not setting you\nfree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please.\u201d He pleaded, looking\nhelpless.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>You reached down between you to grab his\ncock.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He begged again, looking\npitiful.</p><p>You positioned the tip by your entrance\nand he didn\u2019t dare say anything, afraid his words would make you change your\nmind.</p><p>You lowered yourself and he moaned\nloudly. With your hands on his shoulders you allowed him to slide in all the\nway slowly.</p><p>\u201cFuck you\u2019re so tight\u2026\u201d He groaned and\nsquirmed, moving his thighs.</p><p>Your own relief distracted you and you\nbegan to ride him to get some pleasure for yourself.</p><p>He was so sensitive to your touch by now\nthat he turned into a moaning mess by the least amount of movement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d He begged, panting.</p><p>His big eyes looked innocent, something\nyou wouldn\u2019t fall for.</p><p>You went faster and deeper, making his\nthighs tense. You brushed his hair away from his face by pulling it all back\nand he groaned.</p><p>\u201cJust let me hold your thighs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed onto his broad shoulders to\nsupport yourself as you tried to ride him even faster, quickly sending him\nclose to his desperate release.</p><p>\u201cPlease let me cum baby.\u201d He whispered,\nalmost inaudible.</p><p>He let out a long groan that grew\ngradually higher in pitch and finishes in almost a whimper.</p><p>\u201cJust a little more.\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cA little more- ah-\u201c</p><p>The knot in your core was starting to\nbreak lose and you could feel yourself coming closer and closer to your own\nrelease but you didn\u2019t want to let him cum\u2026 not yet\u2026 only one more time and\nyou\u2019d let him have it his way after, but was it worth giving up your own build\nup?</p><p>\u201cBaby I\u2019m gonna cum, don\u2019t stop, please\nI\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close too aren\u2019t you? Let\u2019s cum\ntogether baby, don\u2019t let this go.\u201d He tried to convince followed by a loud\nmoan.</p><p>His entire body tensed up beneath you\nand you pushed yourself up and his cock slipped out of you, throbbing.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this to me!?\u201d He cried\nout.</p><p>He was breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cBaby I give up, it hurts, I need to\ncum!\u201d</p><p>He tried to pull his arms out of the\nrope but you held his shoulders in place, trying to stop him.</p><p>You lowered yourself over his cock again\nand he threw his head back with a frustrated scream</p><p>You wrapped your arms around his neck\nand chased your own release, skin slapping against skin as your rode him deep\nand hard.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna cum for me baby?\u201d You\nasked.</p><p>His answer was pointless as he moaned\nout loud and you could feel his load release within you.</p><p>He cursed and his skin was glowing from\nthe sweat and his chest was moving rapidly up and down. You reached down to rub\nyour clit to get closer to your release, beginning to feel bad for him\u2026</p><p>Your muscles clenched and tingled and\nyour bit your lip as you found your well built up climax and milked his cock of\nevery last drop of cum he had to offer. When you moved up his throbbing cock\nslipped out and landed on his thigh, followed by a stream of his cum spilling.</p><p>He coughed softly.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d you caressed his cheek and\nhe looked at you with his wide eyes and an exhausted expression.</p><p>\u201cUntie me.\u201d</p><p>Was he mad?</p><p>You carefully got off him, your thighs\nquivering slightly and untied the rope. Before you had the chance to get it off\nof him he had yanked it off himself and stood up and grabbed you with both arms\ntight.</p><p>His lips found your and he kissed you\nhard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking amazing.\u201d He groaned,\nvoice shaky and legs weak.</p><p>\u201cJust you wait for my revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were mad for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never cum that hard before.\u201d He\nwhispered, like a dirty little secret being confessed.</p><p>He walked over to the bed on shaky legs\nand fell down on it.</p><p>\u201cJust you wait.\u201d He groaned. \u201dNow come\nhere and soothe me and show me that you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you needy for some aftercare now?\u201d\nyou giggled and walked over to the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, you did well.\u201d You climbed up by\nhis side and ruffled his hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d He muttered and snuggled\nup against you.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Warm under the covers, head and hand on\nhis chest and soft breathing\u2026</p><p>But you were suddenly woken up by\nTaehyung abruptly sitting up, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d You groaned and looked up at him\nconfused.</p><p>He looked panicked.</p><p>\u201care you ok?\u201d You asked worried.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI- I had a nightmare\u2026 its ok.\u201d He said\nin a deep hoarse voice.</p><p>He lied back down again and you took\nyour spot on his chest back and caressed him softly with your hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry I woke you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. What did you\ndream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, it\u2019s ok now and you\u2019re\nhere with me.\u201d He rolled on to his side and pulled you close.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like nothing to me if\nit was enough to wake you up baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, just go back to sleep now \u2026\nand don\u2019t let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and tightened his hold to make\nyou stop.</p><p>You kissed his cheek and put your arm around\nhis waist.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung was still knocked out fast\nasleep when you woke up in the morning, but you kept your promise and held on\nto him tight until he finally would wake up.</p><p>You both slept in and Taehyung woke up a\nlittle while later and you peppered his face with a bunch of kisses, making him\ngiggle and wake up in one of the best ways possible.</p><p>You caressed his cheek with your hand\nand he smiled and looked at you lovingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy I have you.\u201d He confessed,\nmaking you smile shyly.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream that you were taken away\nfrom me and I felt so lost and I kept running around looking for you without\nknowing where to even look and I panicked and then I woke up and it was such a\nrelief to see you on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, ever.\u201d You\nensured.</p><p>He took your hand from his face and\npressed his lips against it softly.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>You both took the day off today since\nworking from home was highly risky\u2026</p><p>You were seated in the office and looked\nthrough your private emails, clearing your inbox and saving whatever was of\nimportance while Taehyung was in the shower.</p><p>You checked your spam in case something\nhad been miss-categorized and spotted an email with a subject from a weird\nlooking email address.</p><p>You clicked it open and read it.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, changing your\nemails won\u2019t keep me away.</p><p>10 million, if you kill the person I\nwant dead.\u201d</p><p>How did this person get a hold of your\nprivate email!?</p><p>It felt pointless to block them but you\ndid anyway, they could just send you another email from another address unless\nyou entirely blocked the IP.</p><p>You ignored it.</p><p>If they wanted your help, they had to\ncontact you through your work email.</p><p>10 million? You could pull a finger nail\nfor that but kill? What cheapskate was this?</p><p>There were plenty of people out there\nthat would kill for that but you and Taehyung were professionals.</p><p>You had loyal clients, high officials\nfor companies who knew you and you were loyal to.</p><p>Some even sent you Christmas cards.</p><p>It was a dark underground business full\nof risks and you didn\u2019t kill for anyone\u2026</p><p>After some quick clicks you managed to\nget the IP blocked from your email account and deleted the email.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first or second time you\nheard \u201cI know who you are\u201d. People knew of you within the business but they\ndidn\u2019t know who you were. It was a cheap trick to seem intimidating and with\nthe price offered it was obvious the person tried to seem threatening in order\nto get the price down. Your price range was clearly listed on the website and\n10 million was pathetic\u2026</p><p>If they emailed your work email you\ncould respond with the price range there, you refused to take it via your\nprivate email and the fact that they had the audacity to find your private\naddress and email it already had them in some dangerous waters.</p><p>Maybe you came off as na\u00efve but the\npeople knew who they were dealing with when they sent this\u2026 you were\nprofessional assassinators, dangerous people.</p><p>A threatening response would have any\nunserious requester to grow immensely paranoid.</p><p>You could take care of this tomorrow\nwhen you would go back to the office, today was a day off after all. You\nswitched off the computer with a determined move and leaned back on the chair.</p><p>A brief moment later the door carefully\npushed open and Taehyung peaked in, dressed only in a towel wrapped snug around\nhis hips.</p><p>\u201cBabe can you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course honey!\u201d You got up from the\nchair and walked over to him by the door.</p><p>He held out his hand with a dainty chain\nhanging over his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to lock it three times now\nbut I give up.\u201d</p><p>You grabbed the chain bracelet and\nhelped him put it on and thus the email was forgotten.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He smiled cutely and walked\nback towards your bedroom with you following him.</p><p>\u201cOh? Are you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to watch me get dressed?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was actually going to go downstairs\nbut since you\u2019re offering a show\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reverse strip tease, watch me get\ndressed.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>You took a seat on the neatly made bed\nand watched him as he walked over to the large closet.</p><p>He assembled an outfit and carried the\npile of clothes back out into the bedroom and placed it down next to you.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cLooks good.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the towel loose and allowed it\nto fall from his hips, exposing him and acted like nothing.</p><p>You admired the view and he grabbed the\nwhite knitted sweater he had selected and pulled it over his head. He bent over\nslightly and put on a pair of boxers and finished off with black fitted jeans.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The day turned out to be quite the\ndomestic one. You went grocery shopping, snuggled with some Netflix, cooked\ndinner and just enjoyed a calm day together with each other\u2019s company. The calm\ndown time you had always managed to remind you of how much you really loved\nthis man.</p><p>To be honest your job was quite\nstressful and could be a source of anxiousness at times.</p><p>The real question was how long the two\nof you would keep this on? For sure you couldn\u2019t be hitmen for the rest of your\nlives\u2026 what if you had kids one day? Mummy and daddy couldn\u2019t go around killing\npeople and burning expensive shoes then, what type of role models would that\nmake you?</p><p>You had plenty of money to never have to\nworry, more than so and despite living together and sharing your life, Taehyung\nstill paid you generously. You did a job after all but it felt odd at times\nsince he tended to swipe his card for you more than necessary either way.</p><p>The discussion about it was pointless\nbecause he wouldn\u2019t listen\u2026</p><p>His warm breathe suddenly tickled your\nneck.</p><p>You were seated on the large white\nliving room sofa in front of the TV downstairs. His hand stroked up and down\nyour thigh and his lips pressed softly against your neck.</p><p>With a low smacking sound he sucked at\nyour skin, leaving a kiss in between every once in a while. His hand grabbed\nyour and placed it against his bulge and you palmed him gently, making him hum\nin pleasure against your neck.</p><p>Before you knew it his lips found yours\nand you were hungrily kissing each other.</p><p>Your hand rubbed against his growing\nbulge harder and you felt yourself grow needy by the mere second.</p><p>Taehyung began to get up from the sofa\nwithout breaking the kiss and with a swift move he lifted you up into his arms\nbridal style.</p><p>He broke the kiss and carried you\ntowards the stairs.</p><p>There was something deviant about his\nsmirk\u2026</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for my revenge baby.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>He carefully put you back down on your\nfeet in the bedroom and grabbed the hem of his sweater and pulled it up over\nhis head, throwing it to the floor.</p><p>\u201cStrip.\u201d He ordered, dragging a finger\nunder your chin.</p><p>His hands grabbed his belt buckle and\nbegan to undo it while he watched you with an intense glare.</p><p>You grabbed the hem of your own sweater\nand pulled it over your head.</p><p>You wanted to kiss him and have you pull\nyour clothes off each other but you didn\u2019t dare disobey him quite yet\u2026</p><p>You unhooked your bra and let it fall\ndown your arms and on to the floor.</p><p>He unzipped his jeans.</p><p>You wore a pair of black work out\nleggings and hooked your thumbs under the hem, pulling them down over your hips\nslowly along with your underwear.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>His jeans were off and he reached into\nhis boxers to free his erection before letting the remaining piece of fabric\nfall down his toned thighs.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees.\u201d He ordered, once\nyou were fully naked.</p><p>You followed his lead and got down on\nyour knees, looking up at him with an anticipated smirk.</p><p>He took a few steps closer and tangled a\nhand in your hair.</p><p>\u201cSuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t try any tricks.\u201d</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the base of\nhis shaft and took him into your mouth, pressing your tongue against the faint\nveins and sucking passionately.</p><p>He licked his lips, looking down at you\nwith a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth does wonders to me baby.\u201d He\npraised, scratching your head soothingly and pushing you a bit deeper.</p><p>\u201cI know you can take a bit more.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head back and moaned\nsoftly.</p><p>\u201cJust like that baby, you know how I\nlike it\u2026\u201d</p><p>You failed to see how this was his\nrevenge\u2026 you enjoyed sucking him off\u2026 especially when it came with countless of\npraise.</p><p>He cupped your face with his large hands\nand took a step back, slipping out of your mouth with a string of saliva\nfollowing.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed, all fours.\u201d</p><p>He helped you up and you climbed up on\nthe large bed as he watched.</p><p>His hand caressed your ass gently.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what I\u2019m about to do to your\nbaby\u2026 but I warned you.\u201d</p><p>Following his words was a loud slap\nsound and a stinging sensation against your right butt cheek.</p><p>You felt your wetness almost leak down\nyour slit from the masochistic pleasure it gave you afterwards.</p><p>He spanked you a second time before\ngetting up on the bed himself.</p><p>Without warning he slipped two of his\nfingers into you and curled, tugging against your muscles teasingly.</p><p>\u201cAlready so wet\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pulled his fingers out and let them\nslide down your slit to your clit and brushed against it teasingly, making you\neven more aroused and wet.</p><p>\u201cGet on your back, I want to see your\nexpression when I touch you.\u201d</p><p>You did as told.</p><p>\u201cSo obedient\u2026 afraid of what I\u2019ll do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d He said pushed your\nthighs apart wide.</p><p>He leaned forward and licked up your\nslit and over your sensitive clit. He thrusted his fingers back into you and\npushed against your inner muscles roughly as his tongue licked across and\naround your clit repeatedly.</p><p>He groaned, sending a gentle vibration\nthrough you and making it all worse.</p><p>You inhaled sharply and failed to hinder\nyour moans much longer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear\u2026\u201d He\nwhispered, followed by a light chuckle.</p><p>He curled his fingers faster, brushing\nagainst your sweet spot and sending you close to an orgasm. Your thighs tensed\nup and your juices were coating his fingers generously.</p><p>You moaned his name, pleading as his\ntongue caressed your clit once more; making you curl your toes before his touch\nabruptly abandoned you.</p><p>He licked his lips and fingers, looking\ndown at you with the most deviant of smirks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s aches, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stroked your thighs soothingly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>You blushed.</p><p>\u201cI could kiss every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand against the bed on\neither side of you and leaned down over you and kissed your right nipple.</p><p>He trailed his kisses between your\nbreasts to the other nipple and latched on to it, sucking roughly and making it\nhard.</p><p>His lips released your nipple delicately\nand he moved back down to between your thighs. His hand gripped them firmly as\nhis tongue licked up your slit again, hitting at your clit and making you\nsquirm from the sensitive tingle, he thrusted his tongue against your entrance,\npushing past with ease and giving you a need to cry out at the teasing feeling.</p><p>The pressure of his tongue so near your\nentrance made you desperate for something to penetrate you deeper. The second\nyou grabbed his hair he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cNo baby, behave. I know you\u2019re eager\nbut I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a hold of his cock and moved\ncloser to you. He dragged the tip up and down your slit, brushing against your\nclit with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cHow bad do you want me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if I\u2026\u201d</p><p>He pushed the tip against your entrance,\nsliding in with the head of his cock, making you moan and pulled out.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d He teased and repeated the\nmove, making your juices leak.</p><p>He chuckled and climbed on top of you.</p><p>Without warning, he thrusted his thick\ncock into you all the way with an aggressive grunt.</p><p>You head fell back and you screamed out\nin pleasure at the filling and stretching sensation.</p><p>He pulled out almost entire before\nburying himself deep again with another groan.</p><p>His hands squeezed your waist and he\nplaced lazy kisses on your neck and chest as he picked up a fast pace, pounding\ndeep and hard.</p><p>His breath grew short quickly and he\nknew these short fast and deep thrusts would send you near the edge fast. He\nknew your body well\u2026 almost too well.</p><p>The numb feeling came running fast and\nyou grabbed on to the sheets tightly, struggling against your breath and need\nto moan.</p><p>Taehyung pulled out completely, leaving\nyour core with a pulsating ache. You tried to clench your thighs but he held\nthem apart with his hips pressed tight against your crotch.</p><p>\u201cOh no\u2026 were you close baby?\u201d he pouted\nand chuckled.</p><p>He reached down between you bodies and\npositioned the tip of his cock by your entrance again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to thrust back in baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven saying please? You\u2019re really\nobedient\u2026 maybe I should-\u201c</p><p>He inserted the head.</p><p>\u201cReward you?\u201d</p><p>You clenched tightly around the little\nhe gave you.</p><p>\u201cIs it not enough?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cThen beg baby.\u201d He said in a serious\ntone.</p><p>\u201cPlease honey, I want you deeper.\u201d</p><p>He slipped in slightly further.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Please! I need you so bad!\u201d You\nhit the bed, frustrated.</p><p>He snapped his hips against you,\nthrusting in hard and making you moan loud.</p><p>He picked up his pace again and fucked\nyou hard.</p><p>It was harder for him to hold back, his\nrelease coming closer sooner than he wanted it to.</p><p>\u201cFuck it.\u201d He mumbled and pounded into\nyou harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really close to cum for you baby,\nare you ready?\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to take my load?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>With each thrust he left out a soft moan\nand they quickly turned into load whimpers and groans as he moved his hips with\nmore force, pounding deeper and harder with straining grunts, chasing the final\nsteps to his edge.</p><p>The tight knot in your core was\nunbearable and you couldn\u2019t wait much longer for him to send you into your\ndesired and immensely craved for orgasm.</p><p>He pulled out without warning, leaving\nyou with the absolute worst of aching feelings.</p><p>He\ncrashed his lips against yours and reached down to jerk himself off until he\nsquirted his cum out on your abdomen.</p><p>\u201dHow\ndoes that feel baby? Huh? Does it feel good princess? Did you want that? All my\ncum on your precious body? Or did you want my cock to cum in your pretty pussy\ninstead? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201dNow\nbeg for me to make you cum princess, beg for my cock to fuck you hard, beg me\nto break you and stretch your tight pussy out and fill it with my cum.\u201d</p><p>\u201dHow\nare you so dirty mouthed?\u201d You panted.</p><p>\u201dInspired\nby you. Now beg.\u201d</p><p>He\nmoved down and sat on his knees.</p><p>\u201dTell me how much you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how much you want me and I\u2019ll let you have\nyour orgasm sweetie, if you\u2019re a really good girl I\u2019ll give you my second\nload.\u201d</p><p>He jerked himself off roughly, breathing heavily. A\nwhimper escaped his throat and you could tell he was overstimulated. The tip of\nhis cock was blushed a deep pink.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d </p><p>He raised a brow, waiting for your pleading words.\nWith his free hand he pressed his thumb firmly against your clit.</p><p>\u201cWorry about yourself and beg.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed against your clit, driving you insane from\nthe smallest touch.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung please! Ah-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! But you\u2019re going to make me cum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>He moved his thumb faster and you cried out.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung please! I- I need you\u2026 I want you\u2026 I want\nyou so bad baby!\u201d You whimpered.</p><p>He bit his lip hard, loving the words and whimpers\npouring from your lips.</p><p>He let go of his cock, grabbed your ankles and pulled\nyou down closer to him before climbing on top of you and thrusting his cock\nback into you hard with a loud whimper.</p><p>The filling sensation after the torture of his thumb\nimmediately sent you dangerously close. He thrusted faster and harder, fighting\nagainst the overstimulated pain and praying for a second release. He was\nsacrificing himself.</p><p>You scratched your nails down his back and with a\nfinal hard thrust your muscles tensed up hard around his cock and let go of you\nwith an aching pulsating sensation and a wave of relief. You moaned loudly, out\nof breath.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You panted, knocked out.</p><p>He winced and hid his face in the crook of your neck\nand shoulder and with a shaky exhale he released a second load of cum,\ncollapsing on top of you, a panting mess.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You switched on the computer in your office and Taehyung\nwas busy opening the large safe out in his office as you arrived.</p><p>You had just remembered the email from yesterday and\nexpected to see something from the same odd looking address in your business\ninbox.</p><p>An accurate expectation indeed\u2026</p><p>You clicked open the email, expecting to see the same\noffer, but what you read made you gasp, causing Taehyung to run into your\noffice, finding you with your hand over your mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asked concerned and ran to your\nside to see your screen, placing a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>-No subject-</p><p>\u201c10 million.</p><p>You ignored my previous email, now I won\u2019t be as nice.</p><p>I know who you are.\u201d</p><p>Attached was a map showing the location of your house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending this to you because I\u2019m offering you 10\nmillion to assassinate Kim Taehyung.</p><p>Or else I will.</p><p>x\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Can you track the IP back?\u201d</p><p>Your hands were shaking as you typed at the computer\nand Taehyung noticed and grabbed your hand and crouched down by your side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ok?\u201d he kissed it and let go.</p><p>You got up the IP but it showed a public library\u2026</p><p>\u201cThey sent an email to my private email address\nyesterday asking for a kill for ten but they never said of who and I\nimmediately blocked them.\u201d You confessed.</p><p>\u201cYour private one?!\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stood up with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it recently but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this, start another business\u2026 with fewer risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had the same thought\u2026 we can\u2019t do this forever\nwhat if-\u201c You held back.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we had kids one day, what would they think of\nus?\u201d</p><p>Had he read your mind?</p><p>\u201cBut the threat\u2026 they know where we live Taehyung and\nthey want you dead!?\u201d You cried out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll move, burn it all and make sure they can\u2019t find\nus I- we can\u2019t contact the police\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t burn everything we want to hide Tae! Burning\nwould give us unwanted attention!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do!\u201d He panicked \u201cWho could\nit be? Maybe some ally to someone we\u2019ve assassinated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Tae, the IP doesn\u2019t give us much. It\ncould be anyone.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a hand through his hair in pure frustration\nand anxiety.</p><p>\u201cFake my death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they want the body!\u201d</p><p>Taehyung grabbed his phone out his pocket and walked\nout of your office.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call our clients, I\u2019m going to find who\nthis is, kill them and then we\u2019re quitting!\u201d</p><p>You gulped.</p><p>Witch a quick click you marked the email as unread,\nhoping it would do something and then deleted the entire account. It would be\nfor the best if you lay low for now and didn\u2019t have any business email\navailable to contact. You walked out to listen to Taehyung\u2019s phone calls and\ntook a seat on his chair while he was seated on the edge of his desk, waiting\nanxiously for someone to pick up.</p><p>\u201cHey it\u2019s Tae.\u201d</p><p>He put on speaker phone so you could eavesdrop.</p><p>\u201cOh? Hey, hold on a second I\u2019m just going to go\nsomewhere more in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, shoot, how\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good, can you tell me everything you know and\nthe reason behind your last booking?\u201d Taehyung asked in a strict tone.</p><p>\u201cIs there an issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The voice on the other end sighed.</p><p>\u201cHe made meth, delivered to us regularly. He asked for\ncash upon request and failed to deliver our orders and I told him if you don\u2019t\nhand us the money back and give us our delayed orders it\u2019s over for you, I have\nmy own customers waiting for me and I was in a sticky situation with multiple\nof them, thus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he affiliated with anyone or a gang or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of, according to our background\nchecks he was a solo business man. But who knows. Why? If you\u2019re in trouble you\nknow I\u2019ll help out, you\u2019ve helped me countless times and I\u2019m forever in debt\nfor your loyalty, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe, or well my lady who is listening too by the way,\njust got a request sent to kill me for 10 million.\u201d</p><p>\u201c10 million?\u201d The voice laughed.</p><p> \u201cThey know\nwhere we live, sent proof and they claimed if she doesn\u2019t do it, they will.\nTracking the IP gave us nothing and I need to find out who these idiots or\nidiot are or is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Tae don\u2019t worry, I say don\u2019t get home\nfirst of all because you never know. Forward everything you got and I\u2019ll have\nmy staff look at it more thoroughly ok? Maybe the IP doesn\u2019t give anything but\nif the device he used has a location on we can easily track where they\u2019ve been\nfor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, we appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! You still have my email right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it.\u201d You whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk great, I\u2019ll update you as soon as they get\nanything form it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and placed the phone next to him on the\ndesk with a deep sigh.</p><p>You caressed his back soothingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we made a deal with them instead? Paid them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey clearly want me dead.\u201d Taehyung admitted,\nhanging his head low.</p><p>You pushed the chair back loudly, making him look up.\nYou felt anger bubble up within you, this wasn\u2019t fun, and you didn\u2019t want to\nsee him hang his head down in defeat this early on. </p><p>Your hands cupped his cheeks and you looked deeply\ninto his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBaby listen, nothing is going to happen to you, or us\non my watch. Whoever this is they\u2019re digging their own grave right now because\nthey\u2019re not going to get what they want and they\u2019re not getting away with their\nattempts even if that means I personally have to kill them.\u201d</p><p>You kissed his lips softly.</p><p>\u201cOk?\u201d You tilted your head to the side with a smile.</p><p>He nodded slowly, looking away from your gaze.</p><p>\u201cNow forward the email you got to me and I\u2019ll forward\nthem all together onwards.\u201d You ordered, patting his cheek lightly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you so calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified, but that won\u2019t solve anything.\u201d </p><p>\u2013</p><p>You forwarded everything you had to Taehyung\u2019s contact\na while ago and ever since the phone call Taehyung had been oddly silent and\nwithdrawn, deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ok.\u201d He answered each time you asked if he was\nalright. How he acted only made you worry more and more and eventually you\nconvinced him to go out and grab something to eat with you. Maybe some energy\nwould lighten him or you could hopefully distract him until your contact had\nany news or updates for you.</p><p>The two of you ended up going home instead and\nbringing take out with you back.</p><p>At the table Taehyung poked at his food while you ate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2026\u201d He started.</p><p>\u201cI can tell, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what we- or well I should do\ninstead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling people for a living.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t comment on it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d He confessed,\nsitting back straight.</p><p>\u201cBefore anything worse happens\u2026 I just think this is a\nsign that we should stop doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just stop, we don\u2019t need to do anything until\nwe figure something out babe. It\u2019s going to be ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I had something in mind ever since you\ntold me about that dream you had long ago\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with the diamonds\u2026 Ever since you mentioned\nit I actually bought a few\u2026 and I sold one last week, as a test\u2026 and I sold it\nat the double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe double?\u201d</p><p>He nodded shyly, yet proudly.</p><p>\u201cI might have rounded up the karat amount a bit\u2026 but\nthe double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble cash or with tax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the table of course\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho bought it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSome dude from Russia, I don\u2019t know. He sent me the\nmoney and I shipped the diamond off express delivery, declared it as glass and\nthat was it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 How much was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c156 million us dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I tried to make it look like we were situated\nin America also as a test and it seemingly worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t he see where it was shipped from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI printed my own customs label and just edited the\naddress to the amazon warehouse as sender, it was easy and people don\u2019t care\nthey just handle it and send it onwards.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI can buy you the biggest house, which ever you\nwant.\u201d He smirked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying half of it, no discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You held you finger up to silence him.</p><p>\u201cBut we need a new house yes\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we look right now? Just for fun?\u201d He asked\neagerly.</p><p>You were relieved that he was in a better mood from\ntelling you about the sudden diamond trading experiment.</p><p>\u201cEat up first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get my laptop we can eat at the same time.\u201d\nHe said and ran out of the kitchen towards the stairs.</p><p>Buying expensive stuff\u2026 a solid distraction.</p><p>Taehyung left his phone on the kitchen counter and it\nsuddenly rang.</p><p>You grabbed it and saw it was your contact and\nimmediately answered for him with your name followed by \u201cthis is Taehyung\u2019s\nphone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I haven\u2019t spoken to you in ages! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, how are you?\u201d You chuckled.</p><p>\u201cAll good, say it\u2019s late why are you still at work? Is\nTaehyung keeping you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 \u00a0we live\ntogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is news! But speaking of news I have some\nupdates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my staff found out that he knew the last guy we\ncalled for, he was his right hand in the business and they were close we\nspeculate. Either way he\u2019s about the same age and we also speculate since the\nheist was made to look like a suicide the police probably confiscated the meth\nlab which obviously would be a an inconvenience for him. What we can see too he\nseems to know what he\u2019s doing with computers and hacking, how on earth he found\nout about you is astonishing\u2026 he must have known about us and hacked us and\nfound out that way and if the fault is on us I can\u2019t do anything but deeply\napologize to both of you and offer anything we can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who he is? Or where he lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a name but no address yet unfortunately,\nwe\u2019re working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeon Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung returned to the kitchen with his laptop in\nhis arms. By the site of you with his phone by his ear his smile fell back into\nthe worrying pout.</p><p>You lowered the phone from your ear and put on speaker\nphone.</p><p>\u201cCan you call us when you find out more about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe owe you.\u201d</p><p>You hung up.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d Taehyung asked.</p><p>\u201cThey know who it is, but they\u2019re still trying to find\nhis whereabouts and when they do\u2026. It\u2019s over for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe final kill\u2026\u201d</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>Taehyung put the laptop down on the counter and took a\nseat before switching it on.</p><p>\u201cOur priority now is getting us in safety, so let\u2019s\nfind a house\u2026 or something temporary we can get on short notice until we get a\nproper new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d You said and took another bite of your\nfood.</p><p>\u201cAny special requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen space and big windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and in a secluded area with guards and 24 hours\nsecurity.\u201d He added.</p><p>Buying a house on short notice maybe wasn\u2019t that easy\nbut when you were able to pay upfront in cash\u2026 you were any real estate agent\u2019s\ndream.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Fast forward it was easier said than done to find a\nhouse without looking at it and you instead opted for temporarily settling at\nthe suite of a hotel until you found something that suited you. After a few\ncalls you had a real estate agent that could assist you on short notice and\nshow you around a few properties in the upcoming days.</p><p>You still hadn\u2019t heard back from your contact\nregarding Jungkook and the little research you attempted to do yourself hadn\u2019t\ngiven much. You knew your codes and IP disguises but beyond that your hacking\nskills were fairly limited and the people your contact had were professionals.</p><p>All you could do was wait, trust and be on your guard.</p><p>In the given moment you were resting against\nTaehyung\u2019s bare chest in the large bed of the hotel suite after haven eaten\nsome room service food you\u2019d called for\u2026 and then having sex.</p><p>In all honesty it was something you needed more than\nyou thought. To destress and get everything out of you to clear your mind and\nspike your mood back.</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s fingers drew lazy spirals up and down your\narm as you both calmed down and you couldn\u2019t help but admire his hand as it\nmoved slowly across your skin.</p><p>\u201cYou always wear such nice rings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d He said, stopping the circles and holding\nout up his hands to look for himself at the dainty jewelry decorating his long\nfingers.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cEach ring has a sentimental meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognize this one.\u201d You pointed towards his ring\nfinger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you picked it, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, it\u2019s for 100<sup>th</sup> kill\u2026 I asked you to\npick something and you choose this ring.\u201d</p><p>The memory returned to you.</p><p>It was indeed long ago and you were in a jewelry\nstore. Back then he was colder and his told you to pick out a ring for him\nbecause he \u201cCouldn\u2019t be bothered to\u201d, you didn\u2019t know what for at the time and\nonly did as you were told.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to pick it because it felt special\u2026 but\nI was dumb enough to not say anything, but I was too shy to\u2026 and since you\u2019d\nhelped me so many times I wanted you to be a part of it in some way\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet.\u201d You giggled and traced across the\nrings with your fingertips, feeling the surface of the dainty silver.</p><p>\u201cI should get rid of it though\u2026 once we\u2019re done I\u2019m\nnever going to assassinate for anyone ever again and then I\u2019m going to throw it\naway.\u201d His voice sounded determined. </p><p>He squished you closer against his body briefly as he\nreached for his hand with his other to pull the ring off and to your surprise he\ntossed it across the room.</p><p>The silver clinked loudly as it hit the wooden floor\nand rolled away across the room.</p><p>\u201cI want to wear something else on this finger anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever get married one day, I\u2019ll need this finger\nin particular.\u201d</p><p>Your cheeks were burning from his words and you hid\nyour face against his chest. </p><p>He laughed softly at your reaction and patted your\nback.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026 Are you tired? Why are you hiding from me?\u201d He\nteased.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sleep time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d He giggled and moved his hand to your\nwaist to tickle you.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaehyung stop!\u201d You laughed, squirming and trying to\nget away from his hand by climbing over him. A dumb choice and a fortunate\nmistake in once.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you\ndown, rolling on top of you and crashing his lips against your neck and\ncontinued to tickle your waist.</p><p>Your cheekbones were aching from the laughing and he\nfinally stopped. Instead he moved his lips from your necks to yours and kissed\nyou slowly and passionately, sliding his hands further up your sides.</p><p>It had almost a soothing effect on you the way he\nslowly caressed your lips with his own.</p><p>After a short while he pulled away and nuzzled your\nneck.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You shook the hand of the real estate agents and said\nyour goodbyes after being shown around multiple properties and quite a few that\ncaught your liking. You were handed a pile of papers of each property to look\nover in private before making any further decisions and you eagerly received\nthem.</p><p>In the car on your way back to the hotel your phone\ndinged, as it would\u2026 but this was a text from and unknown number\u2026</p><p>You could feel your heart sink.</p><p>\u201cYou have 24 hours.\u201d</p><p>You immediately forwarded it to your contact.</p><p>\u201cI just got a text and it says I have 24 hours\u2026 I\nthink it\u2019s from him.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung suddenly hit the brakes hard and did a\ndrastic U-turn.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I should\u2019ve gotten rid of our phones!\u201d He\ngroaned and hit the wheel.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving us a lead to him at least, I forwarded\nit already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking any more risks. The second they find\nhim we get on the next plane back and I\u2019m fucking killing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack from where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever flight has seats available, we\u2019re leaving\nthe country either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am! Turn your phone off!\u201d</p><p>With one hand on the wheel he grabbed his own out of\nhis pocket and handed it to you.</p><p>\u201cTurn it off too and throw them out of the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust throw them out!\u201d</p><p>You turned his phone off and rolled down the window\nand tossed them out on the side of the highway hard, smashing them both.</p><p>Adrenaline began to take over and Taehyung stepped on\nthe gas harder.</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to call us now if they find him\nTaehyung!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck! Maybe they have computers we could borrow or an\ninternet caf\u00e9 at the airport, anything!? We can send them and email? I didn\u2019t\nthink about that, fuck I\u2019m so dumb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it either until it was too late,\nthere\u2019s nothing we can do about it anyway. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>He left the highway at the exit leading towards the\nairport and parked the car at the first available spot.</p><p>The two of your rushed in and luckily found a hotspot\narea with computers and you quickly logged onto your email while Taehyung\nfrantically searched for tickets to purchase.</p><p>\u201cOur phones are out of order, please contact us on\nthis email as soon as you can!\u201d You sent.</p><p>\u201cPlease respond fast.\u201d You begged.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a flight to Vienna in four hours. Should I\nbook it?\u201d Taehyung asked, clearly distressed judging by the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s- Let\u2019s just wait five minutes in case he\nresponds and calm down, ok?\u201d</p><p>Five minutes felt like an hour and you impatiently\nrefreshed the page and to your relief you saw a response.</p><p>\u201cI just tried to call you. We tracked the location of\nthe text and it came from your house.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked over at your screen and read the email\nover and over again.</p><p>\u201cHow did he make it past the security gates? There are\nguards!\u201d</p><p>You exchanged brief eye contact with each other.</p><p>Vienna or going back and hoping he\u2019d still be there?</p><p>Taehyung leaned over to your side and clicked down the\nbrowser on the computer, stood up, grabbed your hand and ran back towards the\ncar, dragging you along.</p><p>The choice was made.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cHe could be waiting for us.\u201d Taehyung said, speeding.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gun hidden in the trunk, just in case; we\u2019ll\nuse that and end it once and for all.\u201d</p><p>You reached your neighborhood in no time and used your\nkey card to open the gate.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the guard?\u201d You questioned, looking\nout of the window.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung stopped the car as the gate closed behind and\nquickly ran out to grab the gun from the trunk and took his seat behind the\nwheel again.</p><p>Everything seemed normal, even the atmosphere and no\ncar was parked near you house or on your driveway. The only car in sight was\nthe car parked in your neighbor\u2019s driveway.</p><p>Even the door to your house was locked.</p><p>Maybe he had just left? Or just roamed around the\noutside?</p><p>\u201cThis feels really weird\u2026\u201d Taehyung said in a low\nvoice, keeping you close by his arm around your waist.</p><p>He unlocked the door and pushed it open carefully.</p><p>Everything was still intact\u2026</p><p>But he had clearly been here? At least according to\nthe position of his location unless he had it hidden but then how on earth\nwould it show your house?</p><p>Nothing made sense!</p><p>You looked around the first level and Taehyung stopped\nyou by the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWait down here and I\u2019ll look upstairs.\u201d He handed you\nhis gun but you refused to take it.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you need it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re after you, not me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the gun.\u201d He said in a strict threatening tone.</p><p>The odd feeling came crawling and you felt more and\nmore of a bugging gut feeling.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d You said and ran out into the kitchen to grab\na knife.</p><p>\u201cAt least take this.\u201d</p><p>He took the knife from you and began walking upstairs.</p><p>Should you check the basement while he checked\nupstairs or stay?</p><p>The best would be if you had each other backs but he\nwas being so stubborn.</p><p>You looked around the living room. It was familiar to\nthe sight but unfamiliar to the feeling\u2026</p><p>The gun was held tight in your hands, unloaded as you\nwalked around the large space.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here\u2026 he\u2019s upstairs. Come out so we can\ntalk.\u201d You whispered and loaded your gun.</p><p>\u201cHow could you tell I was here honey?\u201d A voice\nsuddenly whispered, making you jump. You slapped your hand over your mouth to\nnot scream as you quickly turned around and spotted a dark dressed tall young\nman approaching you from his hiding.</p><p>His hair was short and black and he was strongly\nbuilt, if it wasn\u2019t for that he had threatened to kill the love of your life\nyou would\u2019ve admitted to him being attractive.</p><p>\u201cAre you Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to do it?\u201d</p><p>You aimed your gun at his forehead.</p><p>He scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI expected you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a few steps closer, clearly not intimidated by\nthe gun.</p><p>\u201cSay how much do you know about chemistry?\u201d He asked,\ntilting his head to the side and reaching into his pocket.</p><p>You took a step back.</p><p>What type of question was that?</p><p>Should you just shoot? Call out for Taehyung? For some\nreason your mind couldn\u2019t make a decision and Jungkook took yet another step\ncloser to you.</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to go with plan B.\u201d He muttered and\npulled out a cloth from his pocket.</p><p>He was too fast.</p><p>He grabbed the gun and aimed it away from him with\nstrong force and kicked your leg, tackling you to the ground with a loud sound,\nloud enough to alert Taehyung that something had happened. But before you knew\nit the room turned foggy and you lost consciousness.</p><p>The cloth was drenched in a strong odor, whatever it\nwas made you black out and within seconds Jungkook had your thrown over his\nshoulder and ran out to the car he had parked in the neighbor\u2019s driveway.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You woke up in a seated position, feeling drowsy to\nsay the least.</p><p>Heavy chains were holding you in place against the\nchair.</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re awake.\u201d </p><p>Not the voice you wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some water?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>The room was dark and you could tell where Jungkook was\nstanding but not much else.</p><p>Where were you?</p><p>You blinked a few times and your vision gradually\nbecame clearer.</p><p>It was a basement, clearly. A filthy basement with a\nbunch of newspapers scattered over the floor. In the corner of your eye you\ncould spot a dimly lit area with metal tables with some sort of chemistry\nequipment on\u2026 meth perhaps? Since he was also in the same circles?</p><p>Jungkook caught you looking over at the home lab.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much money I lost when the police\nconfiscated almost everything I had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He poked your shoulder hard.</p><p>\u201cThat guy you killed was my one employee; you couldn\u2019t\nhave picked another spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t, but I had him written as the person owning\nit to use him as my scape goat, I didn\u2019t care about him, but I cared about my\nshit that got taken away! I have people I need to deliver to! If I don\u2019t\ndeliver to them they send people like you on me!\u201d</p><p>Was he trying to make you feel bad for him? Because it\nwasn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent a message to your man by the way, who I\nhappen to know that you\u2019re dating because your webcam security is faulty as\nfuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>Oh gosh\u2026</p><p>\u201c100 million and he get you back, with almost no\nscratches\u2026\u201d He pulled out a pocket knife and stroked it against your cheek with\na wide smirk.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner he finds you, the less scratches\u2026 see it\nas a game.\u201d He folded the knife back and put it back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cHe has 42 minutes until the first one.\u201d He walked\naway and sat by the tables of the home lab corner.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Panic.</p><p>That was the only feeling mixed with rage that ran\nthrough his veins as he opened the safe in his office, taking all he could\ncarry from guns, diamonds worth more the ransom he asked for and an emergency\nphone he stored there\u2026 just in case.</p><p>He forwarded the email to the contact and immediately\ncalled him the second the phone turned on.</p><p>\u201cHey, I just read the email what the hell is going\non?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took her Jimin!\u201d He cried out. \u201cPlease just find\nhim\u2026 I\u2019m panicking.\u201d</p><p>Using your contact\u2019s name was something your tended to\navoid out of respect but Taehyung was desperate.</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on\u2026 took her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kidnapped her! He wants me to pay a ransom to get\nher back and then I\u2019m going to fucking kill him!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed everything with his free hand and shoved it\ninto a gym bag.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do this without you\u2026 You always made him\nstop and think clearly, being in this alone felt like a disorganized mess\u2026 this\nwas why he needed you, an \u201cassistant\u201d that he so happened to fall in love with\nupon first sight\u2026</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get on it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up!\u201d He begged.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung rushed out to the car and tossed the bag onto\nthe passenger seat while listening to Jimin type away at his computer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd\u2026\u201d He pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t conceal his IP, I have the exact address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he\u2019s an idiot\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jimin gave him the address and Taehyung quickly put it\nin the navigator.</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes!?\u201d He snorted. \u201cI can make it in 15.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks Jimin.\u201d He sniffled, hung up and started the\ncar.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>\u201cThirteen minutes\u2026 what should I do with you huh?\u201d He\nslapped you across the face.</p><p>A few minutes ago you witnessed him take a dose of\nwhatever substance and it was clearly having an effect on him\u2026</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou have a nice face.\u201d He smirked and grabbed your\nchin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll save it for last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat old dude, he used to call me impatient\u2026 pffft,\nmaybe he was right\u2026\u201d</p><p>He disappeared behind you and returned with a flogger\nin his hands.</p><p>\u201c10 minutes princess, start praying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You kept the cold stare at him, refusing to show any\nexpression, neither fear or hope.</p><p>He was high out of his mind, eyes shot red.</p><p>\u201cDrugs are bad for you, you know that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting Stockholm Syndrome one me now? Why do\nyou care?\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone just keeps using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you use the guy we killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different!\u201d he pointed the flogger at you.</p><p>\u201cThe world owed me that one, I\u2019m still guilt free.\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait this long.\u201d He complained.</p><p>To your surprise he took a seat sideways on your lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do besides killing people? Do you collect\nstamps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStamps?\u201d You gave him a judging look.</p><p>\u201cYeah, stamps.\u201d</p><p>He got back up again.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t make it either way.\u201d He groaned and raised\nhis arm.</p><p>You kept by your decision to not give him the\nreactions he wanted.</p><p>But it was hard.</p><p>As the sharp ends of the flogger slapped across your\nthighs you had to bite down on your lip hard to hold back.</p><p>Convincing yourself that you could withstand it was\npointless by the fifth time\u2026 he wanted to see blood and wounds and wouldn\u2019t\nstop until you were \u201cscratched.\u201d</p><p>By the eight he tossed the flogger on the floor and\nyou dared yourself to look down at your red, bleeding thighs.</p><p>The tights you were wearing were of course torn and\nripped by the sharp end in no time, leaving your skin exposed for the\nbrutality.</p><p>\u201cHe has 30 minutes till the next; I don\u2019t want to wait\nanother hour.\u201d He muttered and disappeared behind you again.</p><p>He returned with a glass of water and offered it to\nyou but you leaned away from it in rejection.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself then.\u201d He scoffed and took a seat on\nhis chair again.</p><p>\u201cDo you like crack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mess with drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung parked the car in front of a worn down house.\nThe neighborhood seemed to be gradually torn down as the space between each\nhouse was oddly large and looked somewhat like an abandoned construction site.</p><p>He took out a gun from the bag, concealed it by the\nhem of his jeans under his coat and grabbed a second in his hand. He shoved two\nof the diamonds he brought with him in his coat pocket, both of them neatly\nwrapped in a dark blue velvet boxes.</p><p>Taehyung walked up the door and had a quick listen\nbefore opening it. he wasn\u2019t surprised to find it unlocked.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You both heard sounds coming from upstairs.</p><p>\u201cIs he here?\u201d Jungkook questioned and stood up.</p><p>Your muscles relaxed slightly at the relief.</p><p>Jungkook had randomly showed you his tools as a sort\nof \u201centertainment\u201d, laughing at a screwdriver for an entire minute because it\nhad the word \u201cscrew\u201d in it\u2026</p><p>He took his knife out and your suspicion of him not\npossessing any actual weapons increased\u2026</p><p>You hoped Taehyung had a gun.</p><p>Where your gun from before had gone you had no clue of\nand it clearly wasn\u2019t around.</p><p>Maybe he was too much in a rush to kidnap you to think\nof grabbing the gun as well? Or it was waiting upstairs\u2026 Not knowing was\nprobably the worst.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Taehyung looked around the messy place before finding\nthe door leading to the staircase down into the basement. It felt like a likely\nplace\u2026</p><p>But before he could approach the door it swung open\nand he stood eye to eye with the face of his new enemy.</p><p>He immediately raised the gun.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the money?\u201d Jungkook asked, ignoring the\nweapon.</p><p>His nonchalant attitude was intimidating in its own\nway\u2026 may it be that he was high or that he had no fear but treated it like\ndust.</p><p>\u201cLet me see her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah, she\u2019s downstairs.\u201d He waved Taehyung\nalong.</p><p>By now he had noticed the red in his eyes.</p><p>He was making it too easy\u2026</p><p>Taehyung followed Jungkook down the stairs and the\nfirst thing he spotted was the small pool of blood beneath your legs, haven\ndripped from your thighs.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold back his gasp and his hands shook.</p><p>Before heading upstairs Jungkook had pulled a piece of\nfabric over your mouth tightly. But luckily it wasn\u2019t drenched in anything\u2026 but\nit was disgusting.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou took too long. Another minute and I would\u2019ve\npulled out her finger nails.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d Taehyung shoved his hand into his\npocket and pulled out one of the diamonds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth 173 million, it\u2019s more than you asked for\nbut I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted cash, not diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can trade it in for cash, idiot. I have another\nworth 246 if you want that one instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it\u2019s just glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and break it.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook took the box and opened it, taking out the\nclear cut jewel and throwing it against the concrete floor.</p><p>It slid across the floor, near you, still intact.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He muttered.</p><p>Taehyung loaded his gun with a click and pressed it\nunder Jungkook\u2019s chin.</p><p>\u201cNow un-tie her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know you want to kill me?\u201d He\nlaughed and pulled out the gun from before, concealed in the hem of his jeans.</p><p>Fuck\u2026</p><p>He aimed it back at Taehyung.</p><p>\u201cAfter all what I really wanted was you dead and\nasking her was just for fun\u2026 I wanted to see if she\u2019d actually do it.\u201d he threw\na glance towards you with a smirk.</p><p>Taehyung lowered his gun and fired it as his shoulder,\nmaking him lower his gun and wince in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with someone who\u2019s doing this for a\nliving. Did you think I\u2019d ever show any hesitation in firing a gun? You clearly\nare new to this\u2026\u201d</p><p>His shirt was stained with blood.</p><p>\u201cUntie her!\u201d He yelled and Jungkook walked over to\nyou, he dropped the gun to press his hand against his wound and kneeled down\nbehind you to unlock the chains with the key in his pocket.</p><p>His hand quickly stained red and there was a clink\nwhen the chains suddenly feel.</p><p>You freed your arms and got rid of the cloth by your\nmouth and almost threw yourself towards the gun on the ground.</p><p>Jungkook picked up the diamond with his bloody hand\nand stood back up.</p><p>You loaded the gun and aimed it at Taehyung.</p><p>His eyes went wide and he immediately dropped his own\ngun, surrendering.</p><p>\u201cHand over the diamond and I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d You yelled at\nJungkook.</p><p>\u201cJust leave!\u201d He groaned.</p><p>\u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d he whispered, heartbreak\nechoing loud and clear in his voice.</p><p>You held a hand out towards Jungkook for him to hand\nyou the diamond.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d You yelled.</p><p>He started laughing.</p><p>With your attention aimed at Jungkook, Taehyung\nkneeled down and picked his gun back up. The click from the trigger being\npulled half way stole your attention back.</p><p>He aimed it under his own chin.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t what you wanted!</p><p>\u201cHand her the diamond.\u201d He ordered, holding back\ntears.</p><p>\u201cNow this is a show\u2026\u201d </p><p>You quickly aimed the gun away from Taehyung and shot\nJungkook in the leg, making him fall over and you snatched the diamond from him\nand put it in your pocket.</p><p>You turned to Taehyung and place your gun under your\nown chin, triggering a tear to fall down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cHand me the gun babe.\u201d You ordered.</p><p>Without hesitation he released his grip and handed the\ngun over to you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never touching one of these again.\u201d</p><p>You still held your gun at your chin.</p><p>\u201cHand me the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026\u201d</p><p>You pulled the trigger half way and he quickly grabbed\nit out of the hem of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the pay for my kill.\u201d You said and removed the\ngun from your chin.</p><p>You walked over to Jungkook.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not killing you, but I\u2019m killing your business.\u201d</p><p>He looked confused.</p><p>\u201cYou asked if I know chemistry earlier, remember?\u201d</p><p>You walked over to his lab corner and found the\nlighter he had used while taking a dose and simply set the entire lab on fire.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The flammable content on the table immediately caught\nflames.</p><p>\u201cEscape while you have the chance.\u201d You said \u00a0and threw the guns into the flames and\nimmediately grabbed Taehyung\u2019s hand, pulling him along upstairs as the toxic\nfumes filled the basement.</p><p>He was in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the car?\u201d you yelled as you escaped the\nhouse, but he failed to respond.</p><p>You spotted it yourself down the street and grabbed\nthe keys from his coat pocket, dragging him along as you ran.</p><p>\u201cGet in!\u201d</p><p>You took a seat behind the wheel and grabbed the\nrandom gym bag in the passenger seat and threw it into the backseat so Taehyung\ncould sit.</p><p>The adrenaline was rushing through every part of your\nbody, taking over so much that you had completely forgotten about the wounds on\nyour thighs.</p><p>You made a sharp U-turn and speeded away from the\nhouse.</p><p>After a short while you heard Taehyung sniffle beside\nyou and you threw a quick glance at him.</p><p>His face was red and he was straining to hold back his\ncries but to no use.</p><p>He hid his face in his hands.</p><p>You let him cry out.</p><p>You were nearing the exit to your neighborhood when he\nsuddenly cried out his first words.</p><p>\u201cI- I thought you turned on me.\u201d</p><p> \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\nscared you honey\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared me?

And what for when you&rsquo;re clearly not interested.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like you in what way&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just stop talking and kiss\nme.&rdquo; he sighed and reached for you face.</p><p>&ldquo;huh!?&rdquo; you expressed\npanicked, but didn&rsquo;t stop him.</p><p>Your heart was pounding\nhard.</p><p>Suddenly his lips pressed\nagainst yours and kissed you with hunger and you kissed him back equally so&hellip;</p><p>Was this another dream?</p><p>Were you asleep?</p><p>When would these haunting\ndreams ever end!?</p><p>He pulled away and you heard\na sniffle and opened your eyes to see his face a dark shade of red and tears\nwelling down his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is it so hard for you\nto realize that I&rsquo;m in love with you!?&rdquo; He cried out.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take it anymore!&rdquo;</p><p>Why weren&rsquo;t you waking up!?</p><p>You were at a loss of words\nand found nothing to say. As the only possible response to his cries you could\nfigure out was to pull him close again and crash your lips against his. You\nwhipped a tear away with your thumb and he looked into your eyes deeply before\nyou attacked his lips, giving him relief and reassurance.</p><p>He unbuckled his belt so he\ncould get closer and wrapped and arm around you and tangled the other in your\nhair, making sure you wouldn&rsquo;t pull away for however long he needed you.</p><p>He was calming down and his\nhand in your hair fell to your cheek instead, stroking over your skin softly.\nYour lips parted and he pressed his forehead against yours, catching his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I had to quit\nbecause my feelings for you were growing too strong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just confess\nto me? I&rsquo;ve been hurting so long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I- I was too afraid to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why sweetie? I&rsquo;ve done\neverything my confidence let me to hint to you how important you are for me,\nall the times I&rsquo;ve held your hand when we&rsquo;ve run away, when I protect you&hellip; I\nprotect you because I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>It was getting hard to hold\nback the tears now.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I dreaming now too?&rdquo; You\ncried.</p><p>&ldquo;No, this is all real\nsweetie. Finally.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; He kissed\nyour forehead. &ldquo;We need each other, you and I.&rdquo; He moved your hair to behind\nyour ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; he asked\nbravely.</p><p>You hid your mouth behind\nyour hand and nodded, looking down.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>He stroked your cheek again\nand you let go of each other. Taehyung put his seatbelt back on and returned to\nthe road carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kiss you properly\nwhen we&rsquo;re back.&rdquo; He ensured.</p><p>The short ride remaining\nyour mind was pre-occupied replaying the scene you just experienced over and\nover again. The poison was even stronger than in the dream&hellip; You feelings were\nall over the place in a disorganized mess and all you knew was that you wanted\nhis touch back.</p><p>Taehyung parked the car\nbehind the building and got out, grabbed his bag from the back seat and the box\nfrom the trunk. You took the files with you and you walked towards the back\nentrance of the building. He put the box under his arm and grabbed your hand\nwith his free one.</p><p>Your heart was aching so bad\nit physically hurt.</p><p>Once you returned to the\noffice he put his bag down on the floor and the box as well and quickly walked\nover to his desk and knocked almost everything over.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit.&rdquo; He ordered and patted\nthe desk.</p><p>He grabbed the filed from\nyou and threw them on the floor, pushing you back to sit on his desk. He placed\nhis hands on your cheeks and stood between your thighs as he crashed his lips against\nyours and slipped his tongue in. Lust mixed with desperate desire.</p><p>His hands fell to your\nthighs and he leaned forward even closer, forcing you to wrap your arms around\nhim to not fall backwards.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to do this for\nso long.&rdquo; He whispered between the heated kiss.</p><p>Your lust for him was\ngrowing stronger than ever and your hands grabbed onto his belt buckle, tugging\nat it and making you both open your eyes. Your lips parted, faces still closed\nand looking deeply into each other eyes.</p><p>He raised a brow in a\nquestioning expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me?&rdquo; He asked,\nvoice low.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; You confessed and\ncupped his cheek with your hand.</p><p>He moved fast.</p><p>Quickly unbuckled his belt\nand unzipped his jeans, pulling them down with a rough yanking motion along\nwith his boxer and freeing his dick. His hands slid up your thighs and moved\nyour dress up to your waist before he grabbed the sides of your panties and\npulled them down your legs.</p><p>His arms wrapped around your\nwaist and pulled you close and picked you up and he lied you down along the\nside of the desk on your back.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his\nhair.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to go soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do we have time?&rdquo; You\nasked, supporting yourself up on your elbow.</p><p>&ldquo;For a quicky.&rdquo;</p><p>He hands grabbed your thigh\nand he bent down and without warning his lips touched your wetness and his\ntongue licked up your slit. He moved your thighs to his shoulders and held his\nbalance by holding on to the edge of the desk. You fell back against the hard\nwooden desk top and clenched your thighs tightly at the immense sensation he\nsent through you.</p><p>His lips sucked gently at\nyour clit before his tongue suddenly located you entrance and pushed through.\nIt didn&rsquo;t last long and he was hasty, he sucked gently at your clit and slipped\nin two fingers and thrusted them slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to get you nice and\nwet first baby&hellip; I&rsquo;m quite thick.&rdquo;</p><p>His words were teasing all\nat its own.</p><p>&ldquo;I can take it! Please\njust-&ldquo;</p><p>He fingers left you and he\nstood back up properly, looking down at you with dark eyes.</p><p>He licked his fingers clean\nand placed his hands by your hips, moving them up along your outer thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Put your legs over my\nshoulders.&rdquo;</p><p>You followed his lead and\nhis hands caressed your legs as he got closer.</p><p>You could feel hit tip\nbarely touching you until his hand guided himself between your slit.\nAnticipation mixed with need tortured you.</p><p>You moaned softly as you\nfelt his cock push through and stretch you out.</p><p>He bit his lower lip and\nslid in all the way.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it feel good?&rdquo; He\nsmirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; You chuckled almost a\nbit embarrassed, but you had to hurry up now.</p><p>He grip tightened and he\npulled back and thrusted back into you hard with a loud groan and picked up a\nfast pace.</p><p>&ldquo;Next time I promise this\nwill last for hours, I just want you so bad baby.&rdquo; He panted.</p><p>You grabbed on to the edges\nof the desk. He felt amazing and you didn&rsquo;t want it to ever end but you knew\nyou both had to release fast. </p><p>His hands fell to desk edge\nas well and he pushes your legs forward, going deeper and faster with heavy\ngrunts.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck! This is just like in\nmy dream.&rdquo; He moaned, followed by a sweet chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;You dreamt of fucking me on\nyour desk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhmm, but this is so much\nbetter baby.&rdquo; He thrusted hard and deep, making you let out a surprised\nwhimper.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me when you&rsquo;re close\nbaby.&rdquo; He urged.</p><p>You reached down with one\nhand to play with your clit to help yourself get there faster but Taehyung&rsquo;s\nrough speed was almost enough to set you off on its own.</p><p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; You pleaded and bit\nyour lip.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you look so sexy&hellip; I\ncan&rsquo;t wait to see you naked.&rdquo; He panted and placed a kiss against your leg.</p><p>He whimpered, now chasing\nhis own high as time ran shorter and shorter.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna cum.&rdquo; He called\nout and thrusted even deeper.</p><p>Your muscles were crying out\nfor relief through numb tingles and you rubbed your clit faster to catch up\nwith him and it got harder and harder to breathe properly and eventually you\njust held on to your own breath as you expected to break at any moment.</p><p>With a deep exhale mixed\nwith the tones of his sweet voice moaning out in pleasure you could feel him\nrelease his cum inside you as you climaxed. You core pulsated tightly and\nbefore you knew it he abruptly pulled out and pushed your legs off his shoulder\nand almost climbed up on the desk just to kiss you. You pushed yourself up to\nsitting to catch his need for kissing you and your lips crashed.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around\nyou and lifted you up to standing. Your legs were still shaken and weak and you\nlost your ability to stand and caught yourself by wrapping your arms around his\nneck, still not breaking the kiss.</p><p>A trail of his cum leaked\ndown your inner thigh.</p><p>Once you regained control\nover your legs you broke the kiss and quickly reached for your underwear to put\nthem back on while Taehyung did up his jeans and belt again. You pulled your\ndress back down over your hips and thighs and grabbed a tissue from the box on\nyour desk in your office and quickly whipped your thigh clean of his release.</p><p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; You called out,\nlooking at the time.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we need?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung unlocked his safe\nand handed you your gun and grabbed his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the strap.&rdquo; He said\nand tossed it to you.</p><p>You placed your gun on his\ndesk and quickly tied the strap around your thigh and attached the gun to it,\nthrowing the fabric of the dress down to conceal it.</p><p>You gathered together the\nfiles.</p><p>Taehyung hid his gun by his\nbelt and threw his long coat back on before grabbing yours and your hand and\nrunning out of the building.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, it&rsquo;s cold, don&rsquo;t get\nsick.&rdquo; He said and placed it over your shoulders for the short run to the car.</p><p>The stress was oddly\narousing and you finally took a seat in the car an hurried away towards your\nlocation.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Brook Street then left.&rdquo;\nYou instructed, looking at the files.</p><p>Taehyung switched lanes and\nnoticed how you suddenly squirmed.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, I can still feel\nyour cum leaking out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dirty girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You made me dirty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wanted me to.&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Left here. And just you\nwait till later&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me hard while\nI&rsquo;m driving, I don&rsquo;t want to show up with a throbbing erection.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you that sensitive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To you yeah. Now where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right after this block.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You pulled up in a\nneighborhood of worn down looking houses. The entire block seemed to be in some\nserious need of restoration and renovation.</p><p>Your target lived in one of\nthe small apartment buildings and you quickly made your way over and inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Third floor, apartment\n1506&rdquo; you informed as you stepped inside the elevator.</p><p>This was an easy mission\ncompared to what you had have in past.</p><p>Sometimes, in worse cases\npeople had been expecting you and caused it to quickly turn ugly.</p><p>The elevator dinged and you\nand Taehyung stepped out on the third floor and found the right apartment.</p><p>Taehyung pulled his gun out\nand loaded it and hid against the wall right next to the door while you\nknocked.</p><p>It took a few knocking\nattempts until you finally heard someone approach the door from inside.</p><p>A large, annoyed looking man\nopened the door with sleepy eyes. Once he saw you he eyes you up and down in\nyour dress and open coat and looked confused but pleased.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a bathtub?&rdquo; You\nasked, trying to sound anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;I so happen to, how come?&rdquo;</p><p>The click from Taehyung&rsquo;s\ngun made him freeze as the gun was suddenly aimed at his head.</p><p>You smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Get in the tub.&rdquo; Taehyung\nordered and you both back him inside and closed the door behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get in the tub.&rdquo; Taehyung\nsaid, more aggressive and poked the gun at his head.</p><p>As you entered the bathroom\nyou threw a quick glance into the apartment and saw the dirty looking at home\nlab in the living room. Did he create drugs of some sort?</p><p>It was none of your\nbusiness, you were here to do your job but it was always curious to know what\nthe causes of these hits were.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not scaring me if\nthat&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re here for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet.&rdquo; You ordered.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung lowered his gun and\nshot him in the foot.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck did you say\nto her?&rdquo;</p><p>The man bent down in pain\nand screamed and you pushed him into the bathtub.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it personal.&rdquo;\nTaehyung threatened and aimed the gun at his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want from me!?\nI don&rsquo;t have anything!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of our\nbusiness, someone just sent us here to wish you good night that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; You\nsmiled.</p><p>He looked confused and a\nsecond later Taehyung pulled the trigger.</p><p>The job was done.</p><p>You pulled out a zip lock\nbag from your bag with a gun and a note in it and Taehyung put on his black\nleather gloves that were in his coat pocket and secured his own gun at his belt\nagain.</p><p>He took the bag from you and\nmade sure to cover the gun with plenty of the man&rsquo;s own finger prints just as\nwith the note before placing the note in the sink and placing the gun in the\nman&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>He shoved the zip lock bag\nin his pocket, removed his gloves and grabbed your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p><p>Making it look like\nsomething it wasn&rsquo;t was something you charged heavily extra for, but what the\nclient wants and pays for, the client gets.</p><p>You set the door to lock\nitself when you left and you got back to the car.</p><p>Taehyung opened the back\ntrunk and inside were two shoe boxes.</p><p>You lifted one of your legs\nup to take your shoe off but Taehyung stopped you.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey no, sit in the\nbackseat so you don&rsquo;t have to touch the ground.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t really mind but\nwent to open the back seat door anyway and took a seat sideways so your feet\nwere out of the car.</p><p>After each mission you had\nlike a tradition to always burn your shoes, the only pity was that the shoes\nyou burned were always so expensive. You once suggested for Taehyung that you\nshould get cheap shoes to wear for missions and burn but he refused.</p><p>You had dismissed the\nthought in the past that maybe he enjoyed buying you expensive shoes, and\nburning them was an excuse to buy more as well as wiping away your traces&hellip; but\nhe never said anything about it.</p><p>Before you had the chance to\nkick off your sparkly heels Taehyung rushed over to you and put the shoe box on\nyour lap and bent down. He grabbed your right ankle and slipped the shoe off\nand repeated the same move with your left.</p><p>You opened the box for him\nand to your surprise there were a pair of black Louboutin pumps inside.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought they&rsquo;ll look good\non you.&rdquo; He confessed shyly and took one on of the shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;All shoes you pick do.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled and looked down.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like them.&rdquo;</p><p>He slipped the shoe on and\nyou giggled, feeling almost like Cinderella.</p><p>Taehyung grabbed the other\nshoe and slipped it on as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Are they comfortable?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They feel good.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung stood back up and\ngrabbed your old Jimmy Choo&rsquo;s and placed them in the box for you. You moved the\nbox off your lap and into the seat behind you and Taehyung held out a hand to\nhelp you up and out of the car.</p><p>They were beautiful.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you should never buy\nshoes for a love because the soles wear out, but they never get the chance to\nsince we burn them.&rdquo; He smiled proudly and closed the door behind him.</p><p>He quickly changed his own\nshoes, getting out of his shiny Dior shoes and into a brown pair of loafers.</p><p>&ldquo;Gucci?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;You know it.&rdquo;</p><p>He closed the trunk and you\nboth got back into the car.</p><p>&ldquo;We have dinner left on our\nschedule.&rdquo; You pointed out once he started the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Starving.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled his wide smile\nthat had your heart melting.</p><p>&ldquo;Where should we eat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a place in mind.&rdquo; He\nsaid mysteriously and tapped the screen display in the car to call.</p><p>The person that picked up\nvoiced a short hello.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo; He hung up.</p><p>You took a short detour back\nto the office and picked up your things and the parcel from earlier before\nheading to dinner.</p><p>Taehyung drove a somewhat\nfamiliar route before stopping by a gate into a gated community of large lavish\nhouses.</p><p>You remembered very well\nthat Taehyung lived here.</p><p>In his backyard was a cozy\nfire pit and that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;d burn your shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we burning the shoes\nfirst?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to&hellip; We&rsquo;re\nhaving dinner at my place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At your place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to cook for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so cute.&rdquo; You\nconfessed shyly.</p><p>This warm domestic side was\nsomething you would never get tired of seeing and now when he was finally\nyours&hellip; you could see his warm smile whenever, his heart finally at ease and\nburning with a new type of fire.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The sun was setting and\nTaehyung threw a few more logs into the fire followed by you tossing your shoes\ninto the fire. You reached down and picked his Diors up and tossed them into\nthe fire as well.</p><p>You had never really had the\nchance to properly explore his large house.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you give me a house\ntour?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been here before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I never explored, I&rsquo;ve\nnever seen your room or the upstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He looked surprised.</p><p>You pulled the blanket over\nyour shoulders tighter around you and nodded.</p><p>He put an arm around you and\nwalked you back inside through the large terrace doors.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much too see but-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it! I want to see\nyour closet too, you always dress so nicely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He giggled.</p><p>You left the blanket on the\nsofa in the living room downstairs and ran up the stairs before Taehyung.</p><p>The first door led into a\nlarge master bedroom with a huge bed made neatly with decorative pillows.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess this is your room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is, but I never sleep in\nit.&rdquo; Taehyung said, catching up to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The bed is too big. It\nmakes me feel lonely.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at him with\npitiful eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d say that.&rdquo; He\nleaned in and kissed you softly.</p><p>You could say that&rsquo;s where\nit all started a few months ago&hellip;</p><p>When everything finally\nchanged.</p><p>Oh yeah, the package!</p><p>It did contain diamonds like\nhe said&hellip; but in form of a dainty choker, made for you.</p><p>The entire piece was lined\nwith tiny diamonds and you didn&rsquo;t dare consider what it could possibly be\nworth. Another of his expensive gifts in a desperate attempt to charm you, when\nhe had already been successful in doing so&hellip;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>His sleepy\nvoice was deep and raspy, making you almost shiver when he whispered in your\near.</p><p>Taehyung\nwas cuddled up tightly against your body from behind, spooning you with a\nstrong arm wrapped snug around your waist.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo;\nHe pouted and nuzzled the back of your neck gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Put\nsomething on.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;d be a\nlot warmer if he just wore pajamas instead of getting right into bed fully\nnude&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You giggled\nsoftly.</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nyou&rsquo;ll have to hug me harder.&rdquo;</p><p>He squeezed\nyou and you made a playful suffocating sound, making him chuckle.</p><p>He hummed\nsoftly and his grip loosened and he placed his hand on your hip, by the hem of\nyou pajama shorts.</p><p>&ldquo;You know\nwhat I mean.&rdquo; He whispered, sounding pleading.</p><p>He pulled\nyour shorts down over your hip slowly and of course you had suspected his hint\neven before that but it was fun to play games with his needs sometimes.</p><p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo;\nhis tone was sultry and you bit your lip as he continued sliding your shorts\ndown your thighs.</p><p>You hummed\na yes and kicked your shorts of the remaining way under the covers and Taehyung\nmoved even closer, pressing his hips against your butt. He quickly reached over\nyou for the tiny bottle of lube conveniently placed on your nightstand table\nand coated his cock with a few drops before throwing the bottle on the floor.\nHe pulled you back by the hips, positioning you in a pose that would make it\neasier for him to slide in.</p><p>The covers\nruffled softly from all the movement and suddenly you felt the tip of his cock\ndrag between your lower lips before pushing through. He let out a short low\ngroan and positioned himself by your entrance before thrusting into you\ncarefully. His thickness stretched you out slightly and the position you were\nin with your thighs clenched together made it feel like an even tighter fit.</p><p>He pushed\nin deep and pulled you back even more to take more of his cock. His arm\nreturned to your waist and he exhaled deeply with a soft moan and rested his\nhead against the pillow; his deep breathing tickled the back of your neck and\neventually you drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Having his\ncock inside you like that was something you both loved. In some way it was cozy\nand comfortable, but an intimate version of being so. Softly clenching around\nhim and feeling yourself get almost incredibly wet from just his still presence\nwas amazing. Sometimes the two of you grew so horny it just became impossible\nto feel asleep that way and you ended up fucking instead and then passing out\nto sleep from exhaustion; Also a great outcome.</p><p>The worst\npart for both of you was when he had to pull out or if he accidently slipped\nout during your sleep. At one time he had cum in his sleep from a dream and\nwhen he pulled out a trail of his cum leaked down your thighs.</p><p>You thought\nit was funny, but Taehyung was embarrassed.</p><p>The last\nthing you felt before falling asleep were his soft lips pressing delicately\nagainst your neck, giving you a gentle kiss good night.</p><p>You moved in with him not\ntoo long ago and you finally made use of his large comfortable bed for more\nthan just sleeping.</p><p>Your old penthouse apartment\nwas up for sale and you were glad you got the chance to invite Taehyung over to\nyour place a few times before he begged you to move in with him.</p><p>Well, a few might sounds\nless than it was but having him stay the night hugging you from behind, his\nnude skin against yours&hellip; was something you wouldn&rsquo;t give up for the world,\nespecially not after sex.</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t get enough of\neach other.</p><p>Almost every night one of\nyou made the other scream out in pleasure.</p><p>There was no shame.</p><p>Some days you&rsquo;d wake him up\nunder the sheets by sucking him off and other days he&rsquo;d tickle your clit to\nwake you up and fuck you before breakfast. There was no end to it. You lust for\neach other was stronger than any force.</p><p>The office, the car, every\nroom of the house&hellip; once even at the very end of a mission.</p><p>May that have been\ncontroversial&hellip; but something came over both of you that day while still wearing\nyour soon to be burned shoes&hellip;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>That night you woke up\nbriefly by soft whimpers coming from your love behind you. His cock was on the\nvery edge of slipping out of your heat and it was a teasing sensation, you\nwanted him deep and right where he was, was dangerously close to one of your sweet\nspots. You wiggled your hips carefully and caused him to slip out fully for\nyour own relief and fell back to sleep.</p><p>A couple of hours later you\nwoke up first and carefully moved out of his hold to lie on your stomach beside\nhim to half-sleep until he would wake up.</p><p>He was breathing softly next\nto you and you couldn&rsquo;t help but admire this sleeping beauty.</p><p>He blinked a few times and finally woke\nup, stretching out his lean arms with a groan.<br />\nHe eyed you up and down as you lied on your stomach next to him and his tongue\nlicked across his lip. </p><p>&ldquo;Nice view to wake up to.&rdquo; He said,\nadmiring your naked body with a smirk. </p><p>You smiled and leaned close to kiss his\nsoft lips good morning.<br />\n&ldquo;Come here baby.&rdquo; He begged and sat up, leaning against the head board with one\narm resting on top of it as he patted on his thigh for you to come sit.<br />\nYou moved your leg over and straddled him, his hands landing on your lower\nback, stroking up and down as you leaned closer to him. </p><p><br />\n&ldquo;What were you dreaming about?&rdquo; You asked.<br />\n&ldquo;Oh&hellip; I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; <br />\n&ldquo;You were whimpering in your sleep.&rdquo; You teased, making him giggle in\nembarrassment.<br />\nHe pushed against your back, making you press tight against him so his mouth\nwas right by your ear.<br />\n&ldquo;I dreamt&hellip;&rdquo; He whispered. &ldquo;That I was fucking your tight little pussy with my\ncock&hellip; Hard&hellip; And you had your hands&hellip;&rdquo; He grabbed your hands, placing them on his\nchest. &ldquo;Here&hellip; While I was pounding into you, making you scream for more than\nyou could handle.&rdquo; He nibbled at your earlobe gently.</p><p><br />\nHis story definitely tied a knot within you. <br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so needy for you baby&hellip;&rdquo; He said sultry and twirled and strand of your hair.<br />\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that Mr. Kim.&rdquo; You grinned and looked down, seeing how his\nmorning wood had developed into a full hard erection, thick and likely\nthrobbing. <br />\n&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; He begged, biting down on his lip as his hand moved down to your\nbutt.<br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been such a good girl lately&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />\nA good girl?<br />\nYou smirked and jumped off of him and got down from the bed.<br />\n&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; He asked in a serious concerned tone.<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a shower, what are you waiting for?&rdquo; You smirked and curled your\nfingers in a come here motion as you headed towards the bathroom.<br />\nYou heard the rustle of the sheets behind you and the sound of his feet\ntouching the floor.</p><p>You entered the bathroom, Taehyung\nfollowing behind and you stepped into the spacious rain shower together.</p><p><br />\nThe water started falling over the two of you.<br />\nTaehyung grabbed your hips and pressed himself close against your butt, his\ncock rubbing against you cheek.<br />\n&ldquo;Baby&hellip;I want you so bad right now.&rdquo; He groaned. You pressed your butt against\nhim firmer, wanting to tease him.<br />\nGood girl? Tsk&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p><br />\nYou turned around and looked into his dark eyes filled with lust and his lips\nparted slightly. </p><p>His hands were already all over your\nbody, caressing and tracing your every curve.<br />\nYou placed a finger under his chin and pressed your lips against his. He\npressed you closer to his wet body and desperately tried to deepen the kiss,\nbut you wouldn&rsquo;t let him. </p><p>You bit down gently on his lip and\npulled away.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; He panted, leaning in to suck on your neck but you backed away.<br />\nHe stared at you intensely as you grabbed the shower gel and poured a generous\namount over your breasts and started to lather in your entire body.&nbsp;<br />\nTaehyung leaned back against the tiles, his hand wrapped tight around his\nshaft. <br />\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this to me.&ldquo; he pleaded, eyes not leaving your body for a mere\nsecond.</p><p><br />\nYou let the soap wash off your body and continued moving your hands over your\nbody. You slipped your hand down between your folds and swirled a circle over\nyour clit.<br />\n\"Ah&hellip; Taehyung&hellip;&rdquo; You moaned, knowing this would make him mad. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t like it when you touched\nyourself, especially not when he was rock hard and needy for you.</p><p><br />\nJust a second later you were impatiently pushed against the cold tiles in the\nshower, your breasts squeezed against the wall and with Taehyung&rsquo;s hands on\nyour hips. <br />\n&ldquo;What the fuck do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; He asked with his mouth right by\nyour ear. </p><p>&ldquo;You know what that does to me.&rdquo; His\ntone was angry.<br />\n&ldquo;Now let me fuck you like the good girl you are before I punish you like the\nbad girl you&rsquo;re trying to be.&rdquo;<br />\nYou nodded. <br />\n&ldquo;Good girl.&rdquo;<br />\nHis hand slid down the outside of your thighs as he squatted down behind you.<br />\nHe parted your lower lips with his fingers and didn&rsquo;t hesitate before pushing\ntwo of them in. You bit down on your lip and suppressed a moan as he roughly\nthrusted his fingers in and out, the only reason being to stretch you out for\nhim.<br />\nHe curled his fingers inside you causing you to clench lightly around them and\nhe pulled out.<br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ready, bend down.&rdquo; He ordered and you did as told, more than ready to\nscream his name.</p><p><br />\nAs you bent down you looked over your shoulder, seeing his cock throb in his\nhand as it slid up and down with pre-cum dripping from the tip.<br />\nHe placed a hand on your butt cheek and dragged his cock up and down your slit.<br />\nHe placed his tip by your entrance and slowly began pushing himself in, groans\nescaping his mouth and yours as he stretched you out even more.</p><p><br />\n&ldquo;Fuck you&rsquo;re still too tight.&rdquo; He whined and pulled out.<br />\n&ldquo;I can take it!&rdquo; You yelled, desperate for him to keep going.<br />\n&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; He asked, the sweet tone suddenly returning.<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure! Just fuck me!&rdquo; You yelled, feeling your walls pulsating, desperate\nfor him.<br />\nHe began pushing himself into you again, groaning immensely as he slipped in\nall the way, making you moan loud followed by a deep exhale.<br />\nHe caressed your right butt cheek, staying still inside you, allowing you the\ntime to adjust.</p><p><br />\nA little whimper from you and he began to pull out and thrusted back in slowly.<br />\n&ldquo;Faster.&rdquo; You panted. </p><p>He increased his speed slightly but it\ndidn&rsquo;t last for long before he gave into his own need and began pounding into\nyou fast and hard, the two of you becoming a moaning mess.<br />\nTaehyung&rsquo;s grip on your hips tightened, signaling that he was close.<br />\n&ldquo;Fuck&rdquo; he grunted and thrusted harder, hitting you to the limit.<br />\n&ldquo;Tae- I-I&rsquo;m gonna-&rdquo; you panted and he thrusted faster.<br />\n&ldquo;Yeah baby.&rdquo; He panted.<br />\nA few more thrusts and he pushed himself in deep and hard making your orgasm\nhit you hard and clench tightly around him, making him cum hard with a grunt.</p><p>You breathed heavily as he carefully\npulled out of you, some of his cum leaking out as he did.<br />\nHe hastily wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled your back up against\nhim and kissed your cheek.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo; He whispered and chuckled lightly.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You typed away at the computer in your\noffice, checking the website you ran for the business and updated the filter to\nkeep out any &ldquo;unserious&rdquo; clients.</p><p>Of course the website wasn&rsquo;t something\nyou could simply google.</p><p>If you knew the url it would quickly\nbecome unusable as you changed the name of the website frequently as well as\nthe contact email.</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetie?&rdquo; Taehyung suddenly called.</p><p>You stood up from your seat and walked\ninto his office. He was leaned forward at his laptop on his desk with a\nthoughtful expression.</p><p>As you walked up to him you stroked your\nhand over his shoulder before wrapping your arms around his neck and leaning\ndown by the side of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;These or these?&rdquo; He moved the tiny\narrow on the screen around a pair of shoes and then clicked another tab and\nshowed another pair of shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Mission or leisure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leisure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like the first ones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want matching ones?&rdquo; He asked\nshyly, turning to his side to look at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Are there?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Not exactly the same, but I found a\npair of heels that were in similar style.&rdquo; He clicked them up to show you the beautiful\nheels.</p><p>&ldquo;You really like it when I wear heels\nhuh?&rdquo; You giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; He kissed your cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re conveniently here I need\nyou to have a look at this email.&rdquo; </p><p>Taehyung quickly searched up the email\nin the inbox and opened it for you to read.</p><p>-No subject.-</p><p>&ldquo;I know who you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that supposed to be a joke?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I thought the same. I&rsquo;m changing the\nemail just in case though.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me when you have so I can update\nit on the page, I just changed the url of it.&rdquo;</p><p>You stood up straight and caressed his\nneck before abandoning him of your touch.</p><p>Before you managed to take a second step\ntowards your office your wrist was grabbed and pulled back.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung moved his chair back from his\ndesk slightly and patted his lap with his other hand.</p><p>Just for a short while&hellip; you thought and\nwalked over to sit on his thighs.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you work like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I can.&rdquo; He said and rested\nhis chin on your shoulder and reached for his computer with one arm on either\nside of you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the way.&rdquo; You laughed and moved\nto get back off but his arms quickly wrapped around your waist, stopping you.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed you tightly around the hips\nand pulled you back against him properly so you were sitting over his crotch,\nwhere he wanted you.</p><p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t sit still, but stay.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>He ignored his work and began kissing\nyour neck softly.</p><p>You held on to the arm rests carefully\nand moved your hips in a slow teasing motion.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like that baby.&rdquo; He whispered,\nsatisfied by the gentle friction.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you wear the diamond necklace for\nme tonight? You haven&rsquo;t worn it since I got it for you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s precious to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I know you ah- yes right there baby&hellip;\nIf I know you right, you&rsquo;re afraid to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s real diamonds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And diamonds are replaceable. If anything\nhappens to it I&rsquo;ll buy you a new one.&rdquo; </p><p>You could feel his hard on growing\nbetween his thighs and you grinded against him a little harder. His hands moved\nto your hips to control your movements but to your surprise he stopped you.</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; </p><p>You looked at the time on the corner of\nhis laptop.</p><p>&ldquo;Almost five.&rdquo;</p><p>He patted your thigh two times.</p><p>&ldquo;The jewelry shop closes soon, we can\nmake it if we hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait why are we going there now?&rdquo; You\nasked confused and got up.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to buy you more diamonds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung no.:&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop me.&rdquo; He said and got up\nfrom his chair. &ldquo;Get your coat, it&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo;</p><p>You stopped him in his steps by grabbing\nhis arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>You pointed down, trying to suffocate a\ngiggle.</p><p>He looked down at his bulge straining\nagainst his jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;It can wait.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Driving slightly over the speed limit\nyou made it to the shop right on time just before closing.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t given up on trying to talking\nhim out of getting you more expensive stuff yet, but you were near to. He was\nso stubborn and claimed that you&rsquo;d be more comfortable wearing the diamonds if\nyou had more of them which certainly wasn&rsquo;t true. But if it made him happy&hellip; </p><p>You sighed.</p><p>Taehyung immediately walked over to the\ndisplays of necklaces but your attention was caught by a pair of dainty\nearrings in one of the glass cabinets.</p><p>It seemed to be part of a collection as\nit was displayed next to a necklace, bracelet and ring in similar style. You\nlooked at the ring for a while and quickly shook off the feeling it gave you\nand moved on to the next display.</p><p>On dark blue velvet were a pair of\nsilver platted cufflinks and they immediately caught your liking.</p><p>They were expensive and you recognized\nthe luxury brand labelled next the price, but as someone who was paid well and\nwithout taxes you could afford to splurge on something for Taehyung&hellip; if he now\ninsisted on getting you something you could insist on getting him something as\nwell.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you Madame?&rdquo; A voice\nsuddenly asked behind you.</p><p>The name tag on the right side of his\nchest made it obvious that he worked in the shop and in regards of the dream\nyou had long ago, he was fairly young to your relief.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to buy these.&rdquo; You smiled\nand pointed towards the cufflinks.</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent choice, they&rsquo;re from the\nnewest collection too. We received it last week.&rdquo; He smiled and grabbed the key\nto the cabinet hung on his belt.</p><p>Taehyung turned around and looked at you\nwith an odd look before making his way over.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you find something?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;Not for me though.&rdquo;</p><p>The employee carefully picked up the\ncufflinks and locked the cabinet.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back with the box.&rdquo; He\nsaid and walked away.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you getting them for?&rdquo; He asked\nin a serious tone.</p><p>&ldquo;For you of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop me.&rdquo; You teased with a\nsmile. &ldquo;I found something I like for myself as well though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The earrings.&rdquo; You said and pointed\ntowards them behind the glass.</p><p>&ldquo;What more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Only them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Show me everything you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing else? Bracelets? Rings?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rings?&rdquo; You giggled.</p><p>His cheeks went red but his serious\nexpression remained.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung you don&rsquo;t need to get me\neverything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to.&rdquo;</p><p>The young employee returned with the\ncufflinks in a dark blue velvet box and wrapped it up neatly in a paper bag.</p><p>You walked over to the counter and paid\nfor the cufflinks.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; you smiled and took the\nbag.</p><p>While Taehyung received help getting the\nearrings you looked around in the rest of the shop. You spotted a pearl\nnecklace, it could be a choker as well but it was hard to tell from the way it\nwas displayed. Taehyung would look good in pearls&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; Taehyung suddenly asked\nwith a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, are you done?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I got you a bracelet too.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked down in defeat and took his\nhand in yours and you left the store.</p><p>The street outside was oddly calm and\nyou glanced around and saw a clothing shop and a hardware store further down the\nstreet.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh that reminds me! Can we go to the\nhardware store quickly?&rdquo; Taehyung suddenly asked.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you need there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just some basic tools.&rdquo;</p><p>You headed towards the hardware store\nthat was luckily open till later and found a basic tool box. Taehyung went to\nlook for a saw quickly and you walked up and down a random aisle and found\nvarious ropes. You felt one of them and the texture was strong and straw like.</p><p>A member of staff walked down the aisle\nand you quickly grabbed her attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, can I get three meters of\nthis?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; She smiled and grabbed a\nmeasuring tape from her pocket and began to measure out the length of the rope\nbefore cutting it off and rolling it up for you.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Rope?&rdquo; Taehyung questioned as he joined\nyou in the line to pay.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you find it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did, but why are you getting rope?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;For fun.&rdquo; You smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;The same fun why I need these tools?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p><p>You walked back to the car with all your\nstuff and finally headed back home.</p><p>You knew why he needed the tools&hellip; your\nnext mission meant the two of you had to go somewhat undercover&hellip;</p><p>He parked the car outside the house and\nyou brought everything inside.</p><p>&ldquo;This is for you.&rdquo; You smiled and handed\nTaehyung the bag from jewelry shop.</p><p>He eagerly opened it, excited to have a\ncloser look at the cufflinks.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you baby.&rdquo; He smiled shyly and\ngave you a soft kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;I got something for you too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did you!?&rdquo; You acted surprised, making\nyou both giggle.</p><p>The bracelet matched the earrings.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing these tonight.&rdquo; He smiled.</p><p>You had a table booked at one of the\nfancier restaurants in town tonight, for date-night</p><p>After a refreshing shower you touched up\nyour makeup and got into a black fitted, shape flattering dress paired with the\ndiamond choker necklace and the dainty earrings. Taehyung wore a white shirt,\nwithout a crease to be seen and the cufflinks decorating the end of his sleeves\nwith a sparkle of shine. Paired with it were a pair of black slacks, black belt\nwith a silver buckle in the same tone as the cufflinks and a pair of dark red\nvelvet loafers.</p><p>Hand in hand looking expensive&hellip; there\nwas something about it that made you smile. Was this what power felt like?\nConfidence? The fact that you were wearing multiple tiny diamonds around your\nneck probably worth more than a few cars?</p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful.&rdquo; He smirked,\nadmiring you while lifting his glass to take a sip.</p><p>His gaze was burning in a way that made\nyou feel like he was eating you rather than the food.</p><p>&ldquo;If only you knew what I had planned\nlater.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Planned?&rdquo; he looked intrigued. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me more&rdquo;</p><p>You slowly traced your fingers up and\ndown the thin stem of your glass.</p><p>Soft jazzy lounge music was surrounding\nyou.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever thought about\nroleplaying?&rdquo; You said in a low voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Roleplaying? Like police officer or maid\ntype roleplay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sort of&hellip; but I was thinking more of a\nhostage situation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to take you hostage?&rdquo; He\nsmirked.</p><p>Oh how wrong he was&hellip;</p><p>You lifted your glass to your lips and\nleft him unanswered.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung took your coat for you and hung\nit up together with his own once you got back home.</p><p>Once he turned back around you grabbed\nthe collar of his shirt and kissed him roughly. </p><p>Before he could react you had already\npulled away.</p><p>His hands landed on your hips.</p><p>&ldquo;Go upstairs, get undressed and wait on\nthe chair in the bedroom.&rdquo; You ordered.</p><p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll regret it. You&rsquo;re my hostage\nnow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me waiting too long.&rdquo; He\nsmirked and broke free from your hold and headed towards the stairs,\nunbuttoning his shirt at the same time.</p><p>You had placed the chair in the middle\nof the bedroom right before you left for the restaurant.</p><p>It was your turn to have some fun.</p><p>You pulled your dress over your head,\nrevealing the black lace body you were wearing underneath and hung it over the\nstaircase the railing as you walked up.</p><p>In Taehyung&rsquo;s office stood the bag from\nthe hardware store and you pulled out the rope before making your way to the\nbedroom.</p><p>Taehyung was leaned back against the\nchair with one arm over his waist as he stroked his cock slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Close your eyes and stop touching\nyourself.&rdquo; You ordered, hiding the rope behind your back.</p><p>He did as told and hid his smirk behind\nhis long fingers that caressed his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit properly.&rdquo;</p><p>He sat up with his back to the backrest\nand you pulled the rope around him.</p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve known.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>You wrapped it around him twice,\nsecuring his arms to his sides and tied it behind.</p><p>You dragged your hand along his jaw as\nyou walked to stand in front of him and then placed them firmly against his\nthighs.</p><p>&ldquo;You can open your eyes now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I dare?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do as you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</p><p>You moved your hands further up his\ntoned thighs and he opened his eyes.</p><p>At the sight of your outfit a wide smirk\nspread across his face and he poked his cheek with his tongue. He looked down\nat the rope around his body, his erection and your hands and back to your face.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do to me?&rdquo;</p><p>You spread his thighs apart and took a\nseat on his left one, crossing a leg over your other and rested your arm\nagainst his shoulder, grabbing his earlobe.</p><p>&ldquo;You have adorable ears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you gonna do to me?&rdquo; he asked\nagain.</p><p>You caressed his jaw and tilted his face\nto your side and leaned in towards his lips, leaving little to no space\nbetween. He leaned forward and you backed slightly, making him lean forward\neven more, desperate for your kiss until the rope held him back and his arms\nstrained against it.</p><p>You giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;d do if I got out of\nthese ropes huh?&rdquo; He asked in a cocky threatening tone.</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the head of\nhis cock and let him slide through your tight grip, making him whimper loudly.</p><p>&ldquo;Behave.&rdquo;</p><p>You let go of him, starting your build\nup for his desperation.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you need to be a bit\ndisciplined.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned close again, brushing his nose\nagainst your cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to make me beg for you?&rdquo;\nHe whispered sultry.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; You grabbed his neck with\none hand and pushed him back.</p><p>His fringe barely covered his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how hard it was for me to\nhold back earlier?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did.&rdquo; You let your hand\nslide down his neck to his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I already have a build-up, be nice.&rdquo;</p><p>You grabbed the head of his cock again\nand slid your hand off it, making him lean his head back and whimper once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby- please&hellip; please be gentle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p><p>You got off his thigh and hunched down\nbetween his thighs and placed a soft his against the tip of his sensitive cock\nbefore swirling your tongue around it. He leaned his head back, giving you a\nview of his thick neck.</p><p>You moved your hair to the side and took\noff your diamond choker and stood back up.</p><p>&ldquo;It would look good on you.&rdquo; You smirked\nand straddled his thigh as you put the choker around his neck.</p><p>You placed two fingers under his chin\nand leaned in to kiss him, finally giving him what he wanted.</p><p>You slipped your tongue in, immediately\nclaiming dominance of the kiss before tangling your hands in his hair and\ntugging at it gently.</p><p>One of your hands fell to his neck\ninstead and stroked down his chest and abdomen to the base of his cock. You\nwrapped your hand around his thick shaft and began jerking him off, making him\nmoan against the kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna cum for me?&rdquo; You\nwhispered, briefly pulling away from the kiss and suffocating his response with\nyour lips and tongue, making him only possible to give out a long whimper in\nrhythm with your hand&rsquo;s movements.</p><p>His whimpers grew more frequent and you\ncaressed his tip with your thumb.</p><p>He was breathing heavily and you pulled\naway from the kiss to allow him to catch his breath and hear his sweet moans as\nyou jerked him off faster. He leaned his head back and cursed and you moved\nyour hand from his hair to his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like that baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&rdquo;</p><p>You pulled your hand away.</p><p>&ldquo;No! No! Please don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; He squirmed.</p><p>&ldquo;Please! Ah- Fuck!&rdquo; His breathing got\nheavier and his thigh quivered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so close!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me cum!&rdquo;</p><p>You ignored his begging and stood up and\ntook a step back to stand in front of him as you reached for the shoulder of\nyour lace body and slipped it down.</p><p>His breathing was calming down and his\nhead leaned down and he looked up at you with an intimidating frown.</p><p>Small bead of sweat had formed by his\nchest, making his skin glow.</p><p>You slipped the other side down your\nshoulder and pulled the lace down to your waist, exposing your breasts. You\nwalked over to your nightstand table, out of Taehyung&rsquo;s view and grabbed a hair\ntie to tie up your hair.</p><p>When you returned to him you took a seat\non your knees between his legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how hard I&rsquo;m going to fuck\nyou for that?&rdquo; He muttered.</p><p>You flicked your finger across his tip\nand he winced.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to lay you across my lap and\nspank you until you beg for my cock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you threatening me?&rdquo;</p><p>He smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;I dare you to do your worst baby&hellip;\nJust know I&rsquo;ll get you back for it&rdquo;</p><p>You snorted and rolled your eyes at him.\nA mere second later he bit his lip hard as you grabbed his aching cock and\nswirled your tongue around the tip.</p><p>You took his head into your mouth and\nsucked gently and he hummed in pleasure, leaning his head back.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I taste good baby?&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>His bratty attitude was becoming more\nand more of a burden&hellip;</p><p>You pulled him out of your mouth and\nstood back up with a serious expression.</p><p>His gaze travelled up your entire body,\nadmiring the view as you took off the lace completely, leaving you fully nude.</p><p>You sat down on his thigh again and\ntangled one hand in his hair, pushing his head away from you to stretch out his\nneck before your lips attacked it, right above the diamonds that decorated him.\nWith your other hand your swirled you finger around his tip. He inhaled sharply\nand you let out a low long whimper by his neck, knowing it would drive him\ncrazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You got up without breaking your touch\nand straddled his thigh and started to grind down on him. Moving back and\nforth, creating friction for yourself that made your desire and arousal grow\nworse. You let out another moan and lowered your hand in a fist over his cock\nand jerked him off teasingly slow. </p><p>Holding your balance was a struggle so\nyou got up and let go of his cock instead and he looked disappointed till you\npushed his thighs closer together and straddled him properly over his hips.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo; He smirked, hoping you&rsquo;d finally\nride him.</p><p>You put your hands on his neck and\ncrashed your lips against his. You could feel his cock throb by your thigh and\nhe strained against the ropes, pointlessly trying to get closer to you.</p><p>He leaned his head back and managed to\nbreak the kiss, slightly out of breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Please touch me.&rdquo; He begged.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby please, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want me that bad?&rdquo; You caressed his\ncheek.</p><p>&ldquo;I always want you! I want you so\nfucking bad! But I&rsquo;m gonna go crazy if you either don&rsquo;t remove these ropes so I\ncan push you down onto my cock myself or if you ride me baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my hostage; I&rsquo;m not setting you\nfree.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, please.&rdquo; He pleaded, looking\nhelpless.</p><p>&ldquo;It hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>You reached down between you to grab his\ncock.</p><p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; He begged again, looking\npitiful.</p><p>You positioned the tip by your entrance\nand he didn&rsquo;t dare say anything, afraid his words would make you change your\nmind.</p><p>You lowered yourself and he moaned\nloudly. With your hands on his shoulders you allowed him to slide in all the\nway slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you&rsquo;re so tight&hellip;&rdquo; He groaned and\nsquirmed, moving his thighs.</p><p>Your own relief distracted you and you\nbegan to ride him to get some pleasure for yourself.</p><p>He was so sensitive to your touch by now\nthat he turned into a moaning mess by the least amount of movement.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo; He begged, panting.</p><p>His big eyes looked innocent, something\nyou wouldn&rsquo;t fall for.</p><p>You went faster and deeper, making his\nthighs tense. You brushed his hair away from his face by pulling it all back\nand he groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Just let me hold your thighs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>You grabbed onto his broad shoulders to\nsupport yourself as you tried to ride him even faster, quickly sending him\nclose to his desperate release.</p><p>&ldquo;Please let me cum baby.&rdquo; He whispered,\nalmost inaudible.</p><p>He let out a long groan that grew\ngradually higher in pitch and finishes in almost a whimper.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little more.&rdquo; He begged.</p><p>&ldquo;A little more- ah-&ldquo;</p><p>The knot in your core was starting to\nbreak lose and you could feel yourself coming closer and closer to your own\nrelease but you didn&rsquo;t want to let him cum&hellip; not yet&hellip; only one more time and\nyou&rsquo;d let him have it his way after, but was it worth giving up your own build\nup?</p><p>&ldquo;Baby I&rsquo;m gonna cum, don&rsquo;t stop, please\nI&rsquo;m begging you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re close too aren&rsquo;t you? Let&rsquo;s cum\ntogether baby, don&rsquo;t let this go.&rdquo; He tried to convince followed by a loud\nmoan.</p><p>His entire body tensed up beneath you\nand you pushed yourself up and his cock slipped out of you, throbbing.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you do this to me!?&rdquo; He cried\nout.</p><p>He was breathing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby I give up, it hurts, I need to\ncum!&rdquo;</p><p>He tried to pull his arms out of the\nrope but you held his shoulders in place, trying to stop him.</p><p>You lowered yourself over his cock again\nand he threw his head back with a frustrated scream</p><p>You wrapped your arms around his neck\nand chased your own release, skin slapping against skin as your rode him deep\nand hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna cum for me baby?&rdquo; You\nasked.</p><p>His answer was pointless as he moaned\nout loud and you could feel his load release within you.</p><p>He cursed and his skin was glowing from\nthe sweat and his chest was moving rapidly up and down. You reached down to rub\nyour clit to get closer to your release, beginning to feel bad for him&hellip;</p><p>Your muscles clenched and tingled and\nyour bit your lip as you found your well built up climax and milked his cock of\nevery last drop of cum he had to offer. When you moved up his throbbing cock\nslipped out and landed on his thigh, followed by a stream of his cum spilling.</p><p>He coughed softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; you caressed his cheek and\nhe looked at you with his wide eyes and an exhausted expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Untie me.&rdquo;</p><p>Was he mad?</p><p>You carefully got off him, your thighs\nquivering slightly and untied the rope. Before you had the chance to get it off\nof him he had yanked it off himself and stood up and grabbed you with both arms\ntight.</p><p>His lips found your and he kissed you\nhard.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking amazing.&rdquo; He groaned,\nvoice shaky and legs weak.</p><p>&ldquo;Just you wait for my revenge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were mad for a second.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never cum that hard before.&rdquo; He\nwhispered, like a dirty little secret being confessed.</p><p>He walked over to the bed on shaky legs\nand fell down on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Just you wait.&rdquo; He groaned. &rdquo;Now come\nhere and soothe me and show me that you love me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you needy for some aftercare now?&rdquo;\nyou giggled and walked over to the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;You owe me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do, you did well.&rdquo; You climbed up by\nhis side and ruffled his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do, very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say it again.&rdquo; He muttered and snuggled\nup against you.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Warm under the covers, head and hand on\nhis chest and soft breathing&hellip;</p><p>But you were suddenly woken up by\nTaehyung abruptly sitting up, breathing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae?&rdquo; You groaned and looked up at him\nconfused.</p><p>He looked panicked.</p><p>&ldquo;are you ok?&rdquo; You asked worried.</p><p>He pulled a hand through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I had a nightmare&hellip; its ok.&rdquo; He said\nin a deep hoarse voice.</p><p>He lied back down again and you took\nyour spot on his chest back and caressed him softly with your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I woke you up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault. What did you\ndream?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was nothing, it&rsquo;s ok now and you&rsquo;re\nhere with me.&rdquo; He rolled on to his side and pulled you close.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like nothing to me if\nit was enough to wake you up baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, just go back to sleep now &hellip;\nand don&rsquo;t let go of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you tell me tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and tightened his hold to make\nyou stop.</p><p>You kissed his cheek and put your arm around\nhis waist.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung was still knocked out fast\nasleep when you woke up in the morning, but you kept your promise and held on\nto him tight until he finally would wake up.</p><p>You both slept in and Taehyung woke up a\nlittle while later and you peppered his face with a bunch of kisses, making him\ngiggle and wake up in one of the best ways possible.</p><p>You caressed his cheek with your hand\nand he smiled and looked at you lovingly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy I have you.&rdquo; He confessed,\nmaking you smile shyly.</p><p>&ldquo;I had a dream that you were taken away\nfrom me and I felt so lost and I kept running around looking for you without\nknowing where to even look and I panicked and then I woke up and it was such a\nrelief to see you on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere, ever.&rdquo; You\nensured.</p><p>He took your hand from his face and\npressed his lips against it softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>You both took the day off today since\nworking from home was highly risky&hellip;</p><p>You were seated in the office and looked\nthrough your private emails, clearing your inbox and saving whatever was of\nimportance while Taehyung was in the shower.</p><p>You checked your spam in case something\nhad been miss-categorized and spotted an email with a subject from a weird\nlooking email address.</p><p>You clicked it open and read it.</p><p>&ldquo;I know who you are, changing your\nemails won&rsquo;t keep me away.</p><p>10 million, if you kill the person I\nwant dead.&rdquo;</p><p>How did this person get a hold of your\nprivate email!?</p><p>It felt pointless to block them but you\ndid anyway, they could just send you another email from another address unless\nyou entirely blocked the IP.</p><p>You ignored it.</p><p>If they wanted your help, they had to\ncontact you through your work email.</p><p>10 million? You could pull a finger nail\nfor that but kill? What cheapskate was this?</p><p>There were plenty of people out there\nthat would kill for that but you and Taehyung were professionals.</p><p>You had loyal clients, high officials\nfor companies who knew you and you were loyal to.</p><p>Some even sent you Christmas cards.</p><p>It was a dark underground business full\nof risks and you didn&rsquo;t kill for anyone&hellip;</p><p>After some quick clicks you managed to\nget the IP blocked from your email account and deleted the email.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first or second time you\nheard &ldquo;I know who you are&rdquo;. People knew of you within the business but they\ndidn&rsquo;t know who you were. It was a cheap trick to seem intimidating and with\nthe price offered it was obvious the person tried to seem threatening in order\nto get the price down. Your price range was clearly listed on the website and\n10 million was pathetic&hellip;</p><p>If they emailed your work email you\ncould respond with the price range there, you refused to take it via your\nprivate email and the fact that they had the audacity to find your private\naddress and email it already had them in some dangerous waters.</p><p>Maybe you came off as na&iuml;ve but the\npeople knew who they were dealing with when they sent this&hellip; you were\nprofessional assassinators, dangerous people.</p><p>A threatening response would have any\nunserious requester to grow immensely paranoid.</p><p>You could take care of this tomorrow\nwhen you would go back to the office, today was a day off after all. You\nswitched off the computer with a determined move and leaned back on the chair.</p><p>A brief moment later the door carefully\npushed open and Taehyung peaked in, dressed only in a towel wrapped snug around\nhis hips.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe can you help me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course honey!&rdquo; You got up from the\nchair and walked over to him by the door.</p><p>He held out his hand with a dainty chain\nhanging over his wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to lock it three times now\nbut I give up.&rdquo;</p><p>You grabbed the chain bracelet and\nhelped him put it on and thus the email was forgotten.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; He smiled cutely and walked\nback towards your bedroom with you following him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Are you following me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to watch me get dressed?&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I was actually going to go downstairs\nbut since you&rsquo;re offering a show&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A reverse strip tease, watch me get\ndressed.&rdquo; He laughed.</p><p>You took a seat on the neatly made bed\nand watched him as he walked over to the large closet.</p><p>He assembled an outfit and carried the\npile of clothes back out into the bedroom and placed it down next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks good.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled the towel loose and allowed it\nto fall from his hips, exposing him and acted like nothing.</p><p>You admired the view and he grabbed the\nwhite knitted sweater he had selected and pulled it over his head. He bent over\nslightly and put on a pair of boxers and finished off with black fitted jeans.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The day turned out to be quite the\ndomestic one. You went grocery shopping, snuggled with some Netflix, cooked\ndinner and just enjoyed a calm day together with each other&rsquo;s company. The calm\ndown time you had always managed to remind you of how much you really loved\nthis man.</p><p>To be honest your job was quite\nstressful and could be a source of anxiousness at times.</p><p>The real question was how long the two\nof you would keep this on? For sure you couldn&rsquo;t be hitmen for the rest of your\nlives&hellip; what if you had kids one day? Mummy and daddy couldn&rsquo;t go around killing\npeople and burning expensive shoes then, what type of role models would that\nmake you?</p><p>You had plenty of money to never have to\nworry, more than so and despite living together and sharing your life, Taehyung\nstill paid you generously. You did a job after all but it felt odd at times\nsince he tended to swipe his card for you more than necessary either way.</p><p>The discussion about it was pointless\nbecause he wouldn&rsquo;t listen&hellip;</p><p>His warm breathe suddenly tickled your\nneck.</p><p>You were seated on the large white\nliving room sofa in front of the TV downstairs. His hand stroked up and down\nyour thigh and his lips pressed softly against your neck.</p><p>With a low smacking sound he sucked at\nyour skin, leaving a kiss in between every once in a while. His hand grabbed\nyour and placed it against his bulge and you palmed him gently, making him hum\nin pleasure against your neck.</p><p>Before you knew it his lips found yours\nand you were hungrily kissing each other.</p><p>Your hand rubbed against his growing\nbulge harder and you felt yourself grow needy by the mere second.</p><p>Taehyung began to get up from the sofa\nwithout breaking the kiss and with a swift move he lifted you up into his arms\nbridal style.</p><p>He broke the kiss and carried you\ntowards the stairs.</p><p>There was something deviant about his\nsmirk&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for my revenge baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>He carefully put you back down on your\nfeet in the bedroom and grabbed the hem of his sweater and pulled it up over\nhis head, throwing it to the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Strip.&rdquo; He ordered, dragging a finger\nunder your chin.</p><p>His hands grabbed his belt buckle and\nbegan to undo it while he watched you with an intense glare.</p><p>You grabbed the hem of your own sweater\nand pulled it over your head.</p><p>You wanted to kiss him and have you pull\nyour clothes off each other but you didn&rsquo;t dare disobey him quite yet&hellip;</p><p>You unhooked your bra and let it fall\ndown your arms and on to the floor.</p><p>He unzipped his jeans.</p><p>You wore a pair of black work out\nleggings and hooked your thumbs under the hem, pulling them down over your hips\nslowly along with your underwear.</p><p>&ldquo;Good girl.&rdquo;</p><p>His jeans were off and he reached into\nhis boxers to free his erection before letting the remaining piece of fabric\nfall down his toned thighs.</p><p>&ldquo;Get on your knees.&rdquo; He ordered, once\nyou were fully naked.</p><p>You followed his lead and got down on\nyour knees, looking up at him with an anticipated smirk.</p><p>He took a few steps closer and tangled a\nhand in your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Suck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t try any tricks.&rdquo;</p><p>You wrapped your hand around the base of\nhis shaft and took him into your mouth, pressing your tongue against the faint\nveins and sucking passionately.</p><p>He licked his lips, looking down at you\nwith a wide grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Your mouth does wonders to me baby.&rdquo; He\npraised, scratching your head soothingly and pushing you a bit deeper.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you can take a bit more.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned his head back and moaned\nsoftly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like that baby, you know how I\nlike it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You failed to see how this was his\nrevenge&hellip; you enjoyed sucking him off&hellip; especially when it came with countless of\npraise.</p><p>He cupped your face with his large hands\nand took a step back, slipping out of your mouth with a string of saliva\nfollowing.</p><p>&ldquo;Get on the bed, all fours.&rdquo;</p><p>He helped you up and you climbed up on\nthe large bed as he watched.</p><p>His hand caressed your ass gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for what I&rsquo;m about to do to your\nbaby&hellip; but I warned you.&rdquo;</p><p>Following his words was a loud slap\nsound and a stinging sensation against your right butt cheek.</p><p>You felt your wetness almost leak down\nyour slit from the masochistic pleasure it gave you afterwards.</p><p>He spanked you a second time before\ngetting up on the bed himself.</p><p>Without warning he slipped two of his\nfingers into you and curled, tugging against your muscles teasingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Already so wet&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled his fingers out and let them\nslide down your slit to your clit and brushed against it teasingly, making you\neven more aroused and wet.</p><p>&ldquo;Get on your back, I want to see your\nexpression when I touch you.&rdquo;</p><p>You did as told.</p><p>&ldquo;So obedient&hellip; afraid of what I&rsquo;ll do to\nyou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should be.&rdquo; He said pushed your\nthighs apart wide.</p><p>He leaned forward and licked up your\nslit and over your sensitive clit. He thrusted his fingers back into you and\npushed against your inner muscles roughly as his tongue licked across and\naround your clit repeatedly.</p><p>He groaned, sending a gentle vibration\nthrough you and making it all worse.</p><p>You inhaled sharply and failed to hinder\nyour moans much longer.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to hear&hellip;&rdquo; He\nwhispered, followed by a light chuckle.</p><p>He curled his fingers faster, brushing\nagainst your sweet spot and sending you close to an orgasm. Your thighs tensed\nup and your juices were coating his fingers generously.</p><p>You moaned his name, pleading as his\ntongue caressed your clit once more; making you curl your toes before his touch\nabruptly abandoned you.</p><p>He licked his lips and fingers, looking\ndown at you with the most deviant of smirks.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aches, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stroked your thighs soothingly.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>You blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;I could kiss every inch of you.&rdquo;</p><p>He placed his hand against the bed on\neither side of you and leaned down over you and kissed your right nipple.</p><p>He trailed his kisses between your\nbreasts to the other nipple and latched on to it, sucking roughly and making it\nhard.</p><p>His lips released your nipple delicately\nand he moved back down to between your thighs. His hand gripped them firmly as\nhis tongue licked up your slit again, hitting at your clit and making you\nsquirm from the sensitive tingle, he thrusted his tongue against your entrance,\npushing past with ease and giving you a need to cry out at the teasing feeling.</p><p>The pressure of his tongue so near your\nentrance made you desperate for something to penetrate you deeper. The second\nyou grabbed his hair he pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;No baby, behave. I know you&rsquo;re eager\nbut I&rsquo;m not done with you yet.&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed a hold of his cock and moved\ncloser to you. He dragged the tip up and down your slit, brushing against your\nclit with each stroke.</p><p>&ldquo;How bad do you want me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so wet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would you do if I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He pushed the tip against your entrance,\nsliding in with the head of his cock, making you moan and pulled out.</p><p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; He teased and repeated the\nmove, making your juices leak.</p><p>He chuckled and climbed on top of you.</p><p>Without warning, he thrusted his thick\ncock into you all the way with an aggressive grunt.</p><p>You head fell back and you screamed out\nin pleasure at the filling and stretching sensation.</p><p>He pulled out almost entire before\nburying himself deep again with another groan.</p><p>His hands squeezed your waist and he\nplaced lazy kisses on your neck and chest as he picked up a fast pace, pounding\ndeep and hard.</p><p>His breath grew short quickly and he\nknew these short fast and deep thrusts would send you near the edge fast. He\nknew your body well&hellip; almost too well.</p><p>The numb feeling came running fast and\nyou grabbed on to the sheets tightly, struggling against your breath and need\nto moan.</p><p>Taehyung pulled out completely, leaving\nyour core with a pulsating ache. You tried to clench your thighs but he held\nthem apart with his hips pressed tight against your crotch.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no&hellip; were you close baby?&rdquo; he pouted\nand chuckled.</p><p>He reached down between you bodies and\npositioned the tip of his cock by your entrance again.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to thrust back in baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even saying please? You&rsquo;re really\nobedient&hellip; maybe I should-&ldquo;</p><p>He inserted the head.</p><p>&ldquo;Reward you?&rdquo;</p><p>You clenched tightly around the little\nhe gave you.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it not enough?&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Then beg baby.&rdquo; He said in a serious\ntone.</p><p>&ldquo;Please honey, I want you deeper.&rdquo;</p><p>He slipped in slightly further.</p><p>&ldquo;Please! Please! I need you so bad!&rdquo; You\nhit the bed, frustrated.</p><p>He snapped his hips against you,\nthrusting in hard and making you moan loud.</p><p>He picked up his pace again and fucked\nyou hard.</p><p>It was harder for him to hold back, his\nrelease coming closer sooner than he wanted it to.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck it.&rdquo; He mumbled and pounded into\nyou harder.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really close to cum for you baby,\nare you ready?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready to take my load?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>With each thrust he left out a soft moan\nand they quickly turned into load whimpers and groans as he moved his hips with\nmore force, pounding deeper and harder with straining grunts, chasing the final\nsteps to his edge.</p><p>The tight knot in your core was\nunbearable and you couldn&rsquo;t wait much longer for him to send you into your\ndesired and immensely craved for orgasm.</p><p>He pulled out without warning, leaving\nyou with the absolute worst of aching feelings.</p><p>He\ncrashed his lips against yours and reached down to jerk himself off until he\nsquirted his cum out on your abdomen.</p><p>&rdquo;How\ndoes that feel baby? Huh? Does it feel good princess? Did you want that? All my\ncum on your precious body? Or did you want my cock to cum in your pretty pussy\ninstead? Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Now\nbeg for me to make you cum princess, beg for my cock to fuck you hard, beg me\nto break you and stretch your tight pussy out and fill it with my cum.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;How\nare you so dirty mouthed?&rdquo; You panted.</p><p>&rdquo;Inspired\nby you. Now beg.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nmoved down and sat on his knees.</p><p>&rdquo;Tell me how much you want me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me how much you want me and I&rsquo;ll let you have\nyour orgasm sweetie, if you&rsquo;re a really good girl I&rsquo;ll give you my second\nload.&rdquo;</p><p>He jerked himself off roughly, breathing heavily. A\nwhimper escaped his throat and you could tell he was overstimulated. The tip of\nhis cock was blushed a deep pink.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself.&rdquo; </p><p>He raised a brow, waiting for your pleading words.\nWith his free hand he pressed his thumb firmly against your clit.</p><p>&ldquo;Worry about yourself and beg.&rdquo;</p><p>He rubbed against your clit, driving you insane from\nthe smallest touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung please! Ah-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! But you&rsquo;re going to make me cum!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want you inside me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo;</p><p>He moved his thumb faster and you cried out.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung please! I- I need you&hellip; I want you&hellip; I want\nyou so bad baby!&rdquo; You whimpered.</p><p>He bit his lip hard, loving the words and whimpers\npouring from your lips.</p><p>He let go of his cock, grabbed your ankles and pulled\nyou down closer to him before climbing on top of you and thrusting his cock\nback into you hard with a loud whimper.</p><p>The filling sensation after the torture of his thumb\nimmediately sent you dangerously close. He thrusted faster and harder, fighting\nagainst the overstimulated pain and praying for a second release. He was\nsacrificing himself.</p><p>You scratched your nails down his back and with a\nfinal hard thrust your muscles tensed up hard around his cock and let go of you\nwith an aching pulsating sensation and a wave of relief. You moaned loudly, out\nof breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; You panted, knocked out.</p><p>He winced and hid his face in the crook of your neck\nand shoulder and with a shaky exhale he released a second load of cum,\ncollapsing on top of you, a panting mess.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You switched on the computer in your office and Taehyung\nwas busy opening the large safe out in his office as you arrived.</p><p>You had just remembered the email from yesterday and\nexpected to see something from the same odd looking address in your business\ninbox.</p><p>An accurate expectation indeed&hellip;</p><p>You clicked open the email, expecting to see the same\noffer, but what you read made you gasp, causing Taehyung to run into your\noffice, finding you with your hand over your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He asked concerned and ran to your\nside to see your screen, placing a hand on your shoulder.</p><p>-No subject-</p><p>&ldquo;10 million.</p><p>You ignored my previous email, now I won&rsquo;t be as nice.</p><p>I know who you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Attached was a map showing the location of your house.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending this to you because I&rsquo;m offering you 10\nmillion to assassinate Kim Taehyung.</p><p>Or else I will.</p><p>x&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell? Can you track the IP back?&rdquo;</p><p>Your hands were shaking as you typed at the computer\nand Taehyung noticed and grabbed your hand and crouched down by your side.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, ok?&rdquo; he kissed it and let go.</p><p>You got up the IP but it showed a public library&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;They sent an email to my private email address\nyesterday asking for a kill for ten but they never said of who and I\nimmediately blocked them.&rdquo; You confessed.</p><p>&ldquo;Your private one?!&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>He stood up with a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it recently but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we should stop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop this, start another business&hellip; with fewer risks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the same thought&hellip; we can&rsquo;t do this forever\nwhat if-&ldquo; You held back.</p><p>&ldquo;What if we had kids one day, what would they think of\nus?&rdquo;</p><p>Had he read your mind?</p><p>&ldquo;But the threat&hellip; they know where we live Taehyung and\nthey want you dead!?&rdquo; You cried out.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll move, burn it all and make sure they can&rsquo;t find\nus I- we can&rsquo;t contact the police&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t burn everything we want to hide Tae! Burning\nwould give us unwanted attention!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what else to do!&rdquo; He panicked &ldquo;Who could\nit be? Maybe some ally to someone we&rsquo;ve assassinated?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Tae, the IP doesn&rsquo;t give us much. It\ncould be anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled a hand through his hair in pure frustration\nand anxiety.</p><p>&ldquo;Fake my death?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if they want the body!&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung grabbed his phone out his pocket and walked\nout of your office.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call our clients, I&rsquo;m going to find who\nthis is, kill them and then we&rsquo;re quitting!&rdquo;</p><p>You gulped.</p><p>Witch a quick click you marked the email as unread,\nhoping it would do something and then deleted the entire account. It would be\nfor the best if you lay low for now and didn&rsquo;t have any business email\navailable to contact. You walked out to listen to Taehyung&rsquo;s phone calls and\ntook a seat on his chair while he was seated on the edge of his desk, waiting\nanxiously for someone to pick up.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey it&rsquo;s Tae.&rdquo;</p><p>He put on speaker phone so you could eavesdrop.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh? Hey, hold on a second I&rsquo;m just going to go\nsomewhere more in private.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, shoot, how&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so good, can you tell me everything you know and\nthe reason behind your last booking?&rdquo; Taehyung asked in a strict tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there an issue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>The voice on the other end sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;He made meth, delivered to us regularly. He asked for\ncash upon request and failed to deliver our orders and I told him if you don&rsquo;t\nhand us the money back and give us our delayed orders it&rsquo;s over for you, I have\nmy own customers waiting for me and I was in a sticky situation with multiple\nof them, thus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was he affiliated with anyone or a gang or so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not that I know of, according to our background\nchecks he was a solo business man. But who knows. Why? If you&rsquo;re in trouble you\nknow I&rsquo;ll help out, you&rsquo;ve helped me countless times and I&rsquo;m forever in debt\nfor your loyalty, both of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We, or well my lady who is listening too by the way,\njust got a request sent to kill me for 10 million.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;10 million?&rdquo; The voice laughed.</p><p> &ldquo;They know\nwhere we live, sent proof and they claimed if she doesn&rsquo;t do it, they will.\nTracking the IP gave us nothing and I need to find out who these idiots or\nidiot are or is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand Tae don&rsquo;t worry, I say don&rsquo;t get home\nfirst of all because you never know. Forward everything you got and I&rsquo;ll have\nmy staff look at it more thoroughly ok? Maybe the IP doesn&rsquo;t give anything but\nif the device he used has a location on we can easily track where they&rsquo;ve been\nfor you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, we appreciate it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem! You still have my email right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have it.&rdquo; You whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;We do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok great, I&rsquo;ll update you as soon as they get\nanything form it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;</p><p>He hung up and placed the phone next to him on the\ndesk with a deep sigh.</p><p>You caressed his back soothingly.</p><p>&ldquo;What if we made a deal with them instead? Paid them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They clearly want me dead.&rdquo; Taehyung admitted,\nhanging his head low.</p><p>You pushed the chair back loudly, making him look up.\nYou felt anger bubble up within you, this wasn&rsquo;t fun, and you didn&rsquo;t want to\nsee him hang his head down in defeat this early on. </p><p>Your hands cupped his cheeks and you looked deeply\ninto his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby listen, nothing is going to happen to you, or us\non my watch. Whoever this is they&rsquo;re digging their own grave right now because\nthey&rsquo;re not going to get what they want and they&rsquo;re not getting away with their\nattempts even if that means I personally have to kill them.&rdquo;</p><p>You kissed his lips softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok?&rdquo; You tilted your head to the side with a smile.</p><p>He nodded slowly, looking away from your gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Now forward the email you got to me and I&rsquo;ll forward\nthem all together onwards.&rdquo; You ordered, patting his cheek lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you so calm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrified, but that won&rsquo;t solve anything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You forwarded everything you had to Taehyung&rsquo;s contact\na while ago and ever since the phone call Taehyung had been oddly silent and\nwithdrawn, deep in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok.&rdquo; He answered each time you asked if he was\nalright. How he acted only made you worry more and more and eventually you\nconvinced him to go out and grab something to eat with you. Maybe some energy\nwould lighten him or you could hopefully distract him until your contact had\nany news or updates for you.</p><p>The two of you ended up going home instead and\nbringing take out with you back.</p><p>At the table Taehyung poked at his food while you ate.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking&hellip;&rdquo; He started.</p><p>&ldquo;I can tell, what are you thinking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about what we- or well I should do\ninstead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Instead of what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Killing people for a living.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t comment on it.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this anymore.&rdquo; He confessed,\nsitting back straight.</p><p>&ldquo;Before anything worse happens&hellip; I just think this is a\nsign that we should stop doing this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can just stop, we don&rsquo;t need to do anything until\nwe figure something out babe. It&rsquo;s going to be ok.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but I had something in mind ever since you\ntold me about that dream you had long ago&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What dream?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The one with the diamonds&hellip; Ever since you mentioned\nit I actually bought a few&hellip; and I sold one last week, as a test&hellip; and I sold it\nat the double.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The double?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded shyly, yet proudly.</p><p>&ldquo;I might have rounded up the karat amount a bit&hellip; but\nthe double.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Double cash or with tax?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Under the table of course&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who bought it?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Some dude from Russia, I don&rsquo;t know. He sent me the\nmoney and I shipped the diamond off express delivery, declared it as glass and\nthat was it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; How much was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;156 million us dollars.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you fucking kidding me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, I tried to make it look like we were situated\nin America also as a test and it seemingly worked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he see where it was shipped from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I printed my own customs label and just edited the\naddress to the amazon warehouse as sender, it was easy and people don&rsquo;t care\nthey just handle it and send it onwards.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I can buy you the biggest house, which ever you\nwant.&rdquo; He smirked sweetly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying half of it, no discussion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Babe&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You held you finger up to silence him.</p><p>&ldquo;But we need a new house yes&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should we look right now? Just for fun?&rdquo; He asked\neagerly.</p><p>You were relieved that he was in a better mood from\ntelling you about the sudden diamond trading experiment.</p><p>&ldquo;Eat up first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get my laptop we can eat at the same time.&rdquo;\nHe said and ran out of the kitchen towards the stairs.</p><p>Buying expensive stuff&hellip; a solid distraction.</p><p>Taehyung left his phone on the kitchen counter and it\nsuddenly rang.</p><p>You grabbed it and saw it was your contact and\nimmediately answered for him with your name followed by &ldquo;this is Taehyung&rsquo;s\nphone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to you in ages! How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, how are you?&rdquo; You chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;All good, say it&rsquo;s late why are you still at work? Is\nTaehyung keeping you there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With his phone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip; &nbsp;we live\ntogether.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, this is news! But speaking of news I have some\nupdates.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shoot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So my staff found out that he knew the last guy we\ncalled for, he was his right hand in the business and they were close we\nspeculate. Either way he&rsquo;s about the same age and we also speculate since the\nheist was made to look like a suicide the police probably confiscated the meth\nlab which obviously would be a an inconvenience for him. What we can see too he\nseems to know what he&rsquo;s doing with computers and hacking, how on earth he found\nout about you is astonishing&hellip; he must have known about us and hacked us and\nfound out that way and if the fault is on us I can&rsquo;t do anything but deeply\napologize to both of you and offer anything we can do to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know who he is? Or where he lives?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have a name but no address yet unfortunately,\nwe&rsquo;re working on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeon Jungkook.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung returned to the kitchen with his laptop in\nhis arms. By the site of you with his phone by his ear his smile fell back into\nthe worrying pout.</p><p>You lowered the phone from your ear and put on speaker\nphone.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you call us when you find out more about him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We owe you.&rdquo;</p><p>You hung up.</p><p>&ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo; Taehyung asked.</p><p>&ldquo;They know who it is, but they&rsquo;re still trying to find\nhis whereabouts and when they do&hellip;. It&rsquo;s over for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The final kill&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>Taehyung put the laptop down on the counter and took a\nseat before switching it on.</p><p>&ldquo;Our priority now is getting us in safety, so let&rsquo;s\nfind a house&hellip; or something temporary we can get on short notice until we get a\nproper new home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo; You said and took another bite of your\nfood.</p><p>&ldquo;Any special requests?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Open space and big windows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That and in a secluded area with guards and 24 hours\nsecurity.&rdquo; He added.</p><p>Buying a house on short notice maybe wasn&rsquo;t that easy\nbut when you were able to pay upfront in cash&hellip; you were any real estate agent&rsquo;s\ndream.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Fast forward it was easier said than done to find a\nhouse without looking at it and you instead opted for temporarily settling at\nthe suite of a hotel until you found something that suited you. After a few\ncalls you had a real estate agent that could assist you on short notice and\nshow you around a few properties in the upcoming days.</p><p>You still hadn&rsquo;t heard back from your contact\nregarding Jungkook and the little research you attempted to do yourself hadn&rsquo;t\ngiven much. You knew your codes and IP disguises but beyond that your hacking\nskills were fairly limited and the people your contact had were professionals.</p><p>All you could do was wait, trust and be on your guard.</p><p>In the given moment you were resting against\nTaehyung&rsquo;s bare chest in the large bed of the hotel suite after haven eaten\nsome room service food you&rsquo;d called for&hellip; and then having sex.</p><p>In all honesty it was something you needed more than\nyou thought. To destress and get everything out of you to clear your mind and\nspike your mood back.</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s fingers drew lazy spirals up and down your\narm as you both calmed down and you couldn&rsquo;t help but admire his hand as it\nmoved slowly across your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;You always wear such nice rings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think?&rdquo; He said, stopping the circles and holding\nout up his hands to look for himself at the dainty jewelry decorating his long\nfingers.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Each ring has a sentimental meaning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I recognize this one.&rdquo; You pointed towards his ring\nfinger.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you picked it, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm, it&rsquo;s for 100<sup>th</sup> kill&hellip; I asked you to\npick something and you choose this ring.&rdquo;</p><p>The memory returned to you.</p><p>It was indeed long ago and you were in a jewelry\nstore. Back then he was colder and his told you to pick out a ring for him\nbecause he &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to&rdquo;, you didn&rsquo;t know what for at the time and\nonly did as you were told.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted you to pick it because it felt special&hellip; but\nI was dumb enough to not say anything, but I was too shy to&hellip; and since you&rsquo;d\nhelped me so many times I wanted you to be a part of it in some way&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so sweet.&rdquo; You giggled and traced across the\nrings with your fingertips, feeling the surface of the dainty silver.</p><p>&ldquo;I should get rid of it though&hellip; once we&rsquo;re done I&rsquo;m\nnever going to assassinate for anyone ever again and then I&rsquo;m going to throw it\naway.&rdquo; His voice sounded determined. </p><p>He squished you closer against his body briefly as he\nreached for his hand with his other to pull the ring off and to your surprise he\ntossed it across the room.</p><p>The silver clinked loudly as it hit the wooden floor\nand rolled away across the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to wear something else on this finger anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I ever get married one day, I&rsquo;ll need this finger\nin particular.&rdquo;</p><p>Your cheeks were burning from his words and you hid\nyour face against his chest. </p><p>He laughed softly at your reaction and patted your\nback.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby&hellip; Are you tired? Why are you hiding from me?&rdquo; He\nteased.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sleep time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; He giggled and moved his hand to your\nwaist to tickle you.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung stop!&rdquo; You laughed, squirming and trying to\nget away from his hand by climbing over him. A dumb choice and a fortunate\nmistake in once.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you\ndown, rolling on top of you and crashing his lips against your neck and\ncontinued to tickle your waist.</p><p>Your cheekbones were aching from the laughing and he\nfinally stopped. Instead he moved his lips from your necks to yours and kissed\nyou slowly and passionately, sliding his hands further up your sides.</p><p>It had almost a soothing effect on you the way he\nslowly caressed your lips with his own.</p><p>After a short while he pulled away and nuzzled your\nneck.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You shook the hand of the real estate agents and said\nyour goodbyes after being shown around multiple properties and quite a few that\ncaught your liking. You were handed a pile of papers of each property to look\nover in private before making any further decisions and you eagerly received\nthem.</p><p>In the car on your way back to the hotel your phone\ndinged, as it would&hellip; but this was a text from and unknown number&hellip;</p><p>You could feel your heart sink.</p><p>&ldquo;You have 24 hours.&rdquo;</p><p>You immediately forwarded it to your contact.</p><p>&ldquo;I just got a text and it says I have 24 hours&hellip; I\nthink it&rsquo;s from him.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung suddenly hit the brakes hard and did a\ndrastic U-turn.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The airport.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew I should&rsquo;ve gotten rid of our phones!&rdquo; He\ngroaned and hit the wheel.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re giving us a lead to him at least, I forwarded\nit already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not taking any more risks. The second they find\nhim we get on the next plane back and I&rsquo;m fucking killing him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Back from where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever flight has seats available, we&rsquo;re leaving\nthe country either way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am! Turn your phone off!&rdquo;</p><p>With one hand on the wheel he grabbed his own out of\nhis pocket and handed it to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Turn it off too and throw them out of the window.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just throw them out!&rdquo;</p><p>You turned his phone off and rolled down the window\nand tossed them out on the side of the highway hard, smashing them both.</p><p>Adrenaline began to take over and Taehyung stepped on\nthe gas harder.</p><p>&ldquo;How are they going to call us now if they find him\nTaehyung!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck! Maybe they have computers we could borrow or an\ninternet caf&eacute; at the airport, anything!? We can send them and email? I didn&rsquo;t\nthink about that, fuck I&rsquo;m so dumb!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about it either until it was too late,\nthere&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it anyway. What&rsquo;s done is done.&rdquo;</p><p>He left the highway at the exit leading towards the\nairport and parked the car at the first available spot.</p><p>The two of your rushed in and luckily found a hotspot\narea with computers and you quickly logged onto your email while Taehyung\nfrantically searched for tickets to purchase.</p><p>&ldquo;Our phones are out of order, please contact us on\nthis email as soon as you can!&rdquo; You sent.</p><p>&ldquo;Please respond fast.&rdquo; You begged.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a flight to Vienna in four hours. Should I\nbook it?&rdquo; Taehyung asked, clearly distressed judging by the sound of his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s- Let&rsquo;s just wait five minutes in case he\nresponds and calm down, ok?&rdquo;</p><p>Five minutes felt like an hour and you impatiently\nrefreshed the page and to your relief you saw a response.</p><p>&ldquo;I just tried to call you. We tracked the location of\nthe text and it came from your house.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung looked over at your screen and read the email\nover and over again.</p><p>&ldquo;How did he make it past the security gates? There are\nguards!&rdquo;</p><p>You exchanged brief eye contact with each other.</p><p>Vienna or going back and hoping he&rsquo;d still be there?</p><p>Taehyung leaned over to your side and clicked down the\nbrowser on the computer, stood up, grabbed your hand and ran back towards the\ncar, dragging you along.</p><p>The choice was made.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;He could be waiting for us.&rdquo; Taehyung said, speeding.</p><p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a gun hidden in the trunk, just in case; we&rsquo;ll\nuse that and end it once and for all.&rdquo;</p><p>You reached your neighborhood in no time and used your\nkey card to open the gate.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the guard?&rdquo; You questioned, looking\nout of the window.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time to investigate.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung stopped the car as the gate closed behind and\nquickly ran out to grab the gun from the trunk and took his seat behind the\nwheel again.</p><p>Everything seemed normal, even the atmosphere and no\ncar was parked near you house or on your driveway. The only car in sight was\nthe car parked in your neighbor&rsquo;s driveway.</p><p>Even the door to your house was locked.</p><p>Maybe he had just left? Or just roamed around the\noutside?</p><p>&ldquo;This feels really weird&hellip;&rdquo; Taehyung said in a low\nvoice, keeping you close by his arm around your waist.</p><p>He unlocked the door and pushed it open carefully.</p><p>Everything was still intact&hellip;</p><p>But he had clearly been here? At least according to\nthe position of his location unless he had it hidden but then how on earth\nwould it show your house?</p><p>Nothing made sense!</p><p>You looked around the first level and Taehyung stopped\nyou by the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait down here and I&rsquo;ll look upstairs.&rdquo; He handed you\nhis gun but you refused to take it.</p><p>&ldquo;What if you need it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if you do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after you, not me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take the gun.&rdquo; He said in a strict threatening tone.</p><p>The odd feeling came crawling and you felt more and\nmore of a bugging gut feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; You said and ran out into the kitchen to grab\na knife.</p><p>&ldquo;At least take this.&rdquo;</p><p>He took the knife from you and began walking upstairs.</p><p>Should you check the basement while he checked\nupstairs or stay?</p><p>The best would be if you had each other backs but he\nwas being so stubborn.</p><p>You looked around the living room. It was familiar to\nthe sight but unfamiliar to the feeling&hellip;</p><p>The gun was held tight in your hands, unloaded as you\nwalked around the large space.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re here&hellip; he&rsquo;s upstairs. Come out so we can\ntalk.&rdquo; You whispered and loaded your gun.</p><p>&ldquo;How could you tell I was here honey?&rdquo; A voice\nsuddenly whispered, making you jump. You slapped your hand over your mouth to\nnot scream as you quickly turned around and spotted a dark dressed tall young\nman approaching you from his hiding.</p><p>His hair was short and black and he was strongly\nbuilt, if it wasn&rsquo;t for that he had threatened to kill the love of your life\nyou would&rsquo;ve admitted to him being attractive.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you Jungkook?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, are you going to do it?&rdquo;</p><p>You aimed your gun at his forehead.</p><p>He scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;I expected you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He took a few steps closer, clearly not intimidated by\nthe gun.</p><p>&ldquo;Say how much do you know about chemistry?&rdquo; He asked,\ntilting his head to the side and reaching into his pocket.</p><p>You took a step back.</p><p>What type of question was that?</p><p>Should you just shoot? Call out for Taehyung? For some\nreason your mind couldn&rsquo;t make a decision and Jungkook took yet another step\ncloser to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to go with plan B.&rdquo; He muttered and\npulled out a cloth from his pocket.</p><p>He was too fast.</p><p>He grabbed the gun and aimed it away from him with\nstrong force and kicked your leg, tackling you to the ground with a loud sound,\nloud enough to alert Taehyung that something had happened. But before you knew\nit the room turned foggy and you lost consciousness.</p><p>The cloth was drenched in a strong odor, whatever it\nwas made you black out and within seconds Jungkook had your thrown over his\nshoulder and ran out to the car he had parked in the neighbor&rsquo;s driveway.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You woke up in a seated position, feeling drowsy to\nsay the least.</p><p>Heavy chains were holding you in place against the\nchair.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; </p><p>Not the voice you wanted to hear.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want some water?&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t respond.</p><p>The room was dark and you could tell where Jungkook was\nstanding but not much else.</p><p>Where were you?</p><p>You blinked a few times and your vision gradually\nbecame clearer.</p><p>It was a basement, clearly. A filthy basement with a\nbunch of newspapers scattered over the floor. In the corner of your eye you\ncould spot a dimly lit area with metal tables with some sort of chemistry\nequipment on&hellip; meth perhaps? Since he was also in the same circles?</p><p>Jungkook caught you looking over at the home lab.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how much money I lost when the police\nconfiscated almost everything I had?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; He poked your shoulder hard.</p><p>&ldquo;That guy you killed was my one employee; you couldn&rsquo;t\nhave picked another spot?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was his home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t, but I had him written as the person owning\nit to use him as my scape goat, I didn&rsquo;t care about him, but I cared about my\nshit that got taken away! I have people I need to deliver to! If I don&rsquo;t\ndeliver to them they send people like you on me!&rdquo;</p><p>Was he trying to make you feel bad for him?

He shoved two\nof the diamonds he brought with him in his coat pocket, both of them neatly\nwrapped in a dark blue velvet boxes.</p><p>Taehyung walked up the door and had a quick listen\nbefore opening it. he wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find it unlocked.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You both heard sounds coming from upstairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo; Jungkook questioned and stood up.</p><p>Your muscles relaxed slightly at the relief.</p><p>Jungkook had randomly showed you his tools as a sort\nof &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo;, laughing at a screwdriver for an entire minute because it\nhad the word &ldquo;screw&rdquo; in it&hellip;</p><p>He took his knife out and your suspicion of him not\npossessing any actual weapons increased&hellip;</p><p>You hoped Taehyung had a gun.</p><p>Where your gun from before had gone you had no clue of\nand it clearly wasn&rsquo;t around.</p><p>Maybe he was too much in a rush to kidnap you to think\nof grabbing the gun as well? Or it was waiting upstairs&hellip; Not knowing was\nprobably the worst.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Taehyung looked around the messy place before finding\nthe door leading to the staircase down into the basement. It felt like a likely\nplace&hellip;</p><p>But before he could approach the door it swung open\nand he stood eye to eye with the face of his new enemy.</p><p>He immediately raised the gun.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have the money?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, ignoring the\nweapon.</p><p>His nonchalant attitude was intimidating in its own\nway&hellip; may it be that he was high or that he had no fear but treated it like\ndust.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me see her first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah, she&rsquo;s downstairs.&rdquo; He waved Taehyung\nalong.</p><p>By now he had noticed the red in his eyes.</p><p>He was making it too easy&hellip;</p><p>Taehyung followed Jungkook down the stairs and the\nfirst thing he spotted was the small pool of blood beneath your legs, haven\ndripped from your thighs.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t hold back his gasp and his hands shook.</p><p>Before heading upstairs Jungkook had pulled a piece of\nfabric over your mouth tightly. But luckily it wasn&rsquo;t drenched in anything&hellip; but\nit was disgusting.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck did you do?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You took too long. Another minute and I would&rsquo;ve\npulled out her finger nails.&rdquo; He laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick.&rdquo; Taehyung shoved his hand into his\npocket and pulled out one of the diamonds.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth 173 million, it&rsquo;s more than you asked for\nbut I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted cash, not diamonds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can trade it in for cash, idiot. I have another\nworth 246 if you want that one instead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what if it&rsquo;s just glass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try and break it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook took the box and opened it, taking out the\nclear cut jewel and throwing it against the concrete floor.</p><p>It slid across the floor, near you, still intact.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; He muttered.</p><p>Taehyung loaded his gun with a click and pressed it\nunder Jungkook&rsquo;s chin.</p><p>&ldquo;Now un-tie her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know you want to kill me?&rdquo; He\nlaughed and pulled out the gun from before, concealed in the hem of his jeans.</p><p>Fuck&hellip;</p><p>He aimed it back at Taehyung.</p><p>&ldquo;After all what I really wanted was you dead and\nasking her was just for fun&hellip; I wanted to see if she&rsquo;d actually do it.&rdquo; he threw\na glance towards you with a smirk.</p><p>Taehyung lowered his gun and fired it as his shoulder,\nmaking him lower his gun and wince in pain.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dealing with someone who&rsquo;s doing this for a\nliving. Did you think I&rsquo;d ever show any hesitation in firing a gun? You clearly\nare new to this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>His shirt was stained with blood.</p><p>&ldquo;Untie her!&rdquo; He yelled and Jungkook walked over to\nyou, he dropped the gun to press his hand against his wound and kneeled down\nbehind you to unlock the chains with the key in his pocket.</p><p>His hand quickly stained red and there was a clink\nwhen the chains suddenly feel.</p><p>You freed your arms and got rid of the cloth by your\nmouth and almost threw yourself towards the gun on the ground.</p><p>Jungkook picked up the diamond with his bloody hand\nand stood back up.</p><p>You loaded the gun and aimed it at Taehyung.</p><p>His eyes went wide and he immediately dropped his own\ngun, surrendering.</p><p>&ldquo;Hand over the diamond and I&rsquo;ll shoot.&rdquo; You yelled at\nJungkook.</p><p>&ldquo;Just leave!&rdquo; He groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what are you doing?&rdquo; he whispered, heartbreak\nechoing loud and clear in his voice.</p><p>You held a hand out towards Jungkook for him to hand\nyou the diamond.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this what you wanted?&rdquo; You yelled.</p><p>He started laughing.</p><p>With your attention aimed at Jungkook, Taehyung\nkneeled down and picked his gun back up. The click from the trigger being\npulled half way stole your attention back.</p><p>He aimed it under his own chin.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t what you wanted!</p><p>&ldquo;Hand her the diamond.&rdquo; He ordered, holding back\ntears.</p><p>&ldquo;Now this is a show&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You quickly aimed the gun away from Taehyung and shot\nJungkook in the leg, making him fall over and you snatched the diamond from him\nand put it in your pocket.</p><p>You turned to Taehyung and place your gun under your\nown chin, triggering a tear to fall down his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Hand me the gun babe.&rdquo; You ordered.</p><p>Without hesitation he released his grip and handed the\ngun over to you.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never touching one of these again.&rdquo;</p><p>You still held your gun at your chin.</p><p>&ldquo;Hand me the other one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You pulled the trigger half way and he quickly grabbed\nit out of the hem of his jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you doing this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want the pay for my kill.&rdquo; You said and removed the\ngun from your chin.</p><p>You walked over to Jungkook.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not killing you, but I&rsquo;m killing your business.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked confused.</p><p>&ldquo;You asked if I know chemistry earlier, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>You walked over to his lab corner and found the\nlighter he had used while taking a dose and simply set the entire lab on fire.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>The flammable content on the table immediately caught\nflames.</p><p>&ldquo;Escape while you have the chance.&rdquo; You said &nbsp;and threw the guns into the flames and\nimmediately grabbed Taehyung&rsquo;s hand, pulling him along upstairs as the toxic\nfumes filled the basement.</p><p>He was in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the car?&rdquo; you yelled as you escaped the\nhouse, but he failed to respond.</p><p>You spotted it yourself down the street and grabbed\nthe keys from his coat pocket, dragging him along as you ran.</p><p>&ldquo;Get in!&rdquo;</p><p>You took a seat behind the wheel and grabbed the\nrandom gym bag in the passenger seat and threw it into the backseat so Taehyung\ncould sit.</p><p>The adrenaline was rushing through every part of your\nbody, taking over so much that you had completely forgotten about the wounds on\nyour thighs.</p><p>You made a sharp U-turn and speeded away from the\nhouse.</p><p>After a short while you heard Taehyung sniffle beside\nyou and you threw a quick glance at him.</p><p>His face was red and he was straining to hold back his\ncries but to no use.</p><p>He hid his face in his hands.</p><p>You let him cry out.</p><p>You were nearing the exit to your neighborhood when he\nsuddenly cried out his first words.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I thought you turned on me.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I\nscared you honey&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scared me? You made me think you didn&rsquo;t love me!

It&rsquo;s covered in blood&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just give me the diamond!&rdquo; He cried out.</p><p>You reached into your pocket, driving with one hand\nbriefly and got out the blood stained diamond and handed it to him.</p><p>He took it out of your hand aggressively and clicked\nthe window down and threw it out.</p><p>&ldquo;I never want to see it again!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I didn&rsquo;t take it because I\nwanted it, I took it so he couldn&rsquo;t use it for gain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I got that when you said you were killing his\nbusiness but I still never want to see it again because my heart got crushed\nfor a stupid rock.&rdquo;</p><p>He wiped his nose with the back of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;How can I make it better?&rdquo; You asked desperately.</p><p>He looked down at his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;Go to Vienna with me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Not being in a rush for once meant that you had time\nto rent a last minute private jet to take you to Vienna&hellip; and pack a suitcase.</p><p>A mere day later, less than 24 hours later you were up\nin the air on your way to Austria.</p><p>Who knew how long you&rsquo;d be gone&hellip;</p><p>You just had to leave and if this was enough for his\nheart to repair you would gladly agree to it without hesitation.</p><p>What you did was gruesome and you understood if he\nneeded time to heal.</p><p>He was till distant and withdrawn, not saying much but\nhe still allowed you to caress his fingers over the table as you approached the\nairport in Vienna.</p><p>&ldquo;I bought more diamonds&hellip; they&rsquo;ll be delivered next\nweek.&rdquo; He said, trying to break the silence while looking out of the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung let&rsquo;s not talk about work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what else to say&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want to eat when we arrive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pizza.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then pizza it is, what kind?&rdquo; You continued, trying\nto change the subject and gripping his hand tighter.</p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place I want to go first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see when we get there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it a surprise?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded shyly, expression still serious.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it for my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; He repeated.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Once the plane landed you were immediately driven towards\none of the beautiful palaces in the city area.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to relax after this&hellip;&rdquo; He whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;We will and when we come home we&rsquo;ll burn our shoes,\nwe never did that last night.&rdquo; You hoped it would cheer him up.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to burn my one-hundred ring along with the\nshoes.&rdquo;</p><p>You caressed his cheek, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that\nyou were sitting in the backseat of a car with a driver in front, you would&rsquo;ve\ntold him many more things.</p><p>You looked down at his hands tightly held by your and\nnoticed the shimmer at his sleeves.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing the cufflinks!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I am&hellip; and you&rsquo;re wearing the earrings&hellip; I\nnoticed it earlier.&rdquo; He confessed shyly.</p><p>&ldquo;We should get something matching.&rdquo;</p><p>For some reason that sentence made him crack a smile\nand chuckle softly.</p><p>The driver stopped the car and you got out in front of\nthe palace.</p><p>It was dark and the garden was lit up by multiple\nlights.</p><p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo; Taehyung said and guided you by the hand\nthrough the park until you got to a large fountain.</p><p>&ldquo;You wanted something matching?&rdquo;</p><p>He went down on one knee and your heart rate spiked\nwith a soft gasp.</p><p>He took out a red velvet box from his coat pocket and\nopened it for you, showing the two dainty rings, one with a large diamond and\nthe other lined with diamonds around it.</p><p>&ldquo;Marry me&hellip; will you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; you giggled, no doubts.</p><p>He smiled cutely and took the ring with the large\ndiamond out of the box, placing the box carefully on his knee and reaching for\nyour hand.</p><p>He slipped it on your ring finger for you and took a\nsecond to admire it on your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you put mine on me?&rdquo; he asked and took the box\nagain, standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;You have an engagement ring too?&rdquo; You smiled widely,\ntaking it out of the box.</p><p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;m engaged too.&rdquo;</p><p>You put the ring on his finger and it sparkled the\nmost out of all.
