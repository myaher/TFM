        "answer": "<p>Well it\u2019s because of what the <i>implications</i> of these parallels are. They\u2019re not just isolated comparisons,  they signpost and foreshadow certain things about the future of Sansa\u2019s arc. They\u2019re part of a bigger picture - a picture I believe (as do many others, <i>including</i> book-reading <b>non-shippers</b>) includes Jonsa as one of the narrative strands and threads that will ultimately make up the fabric of Sansa\u2019s endgame. </p><p>So, put simply: if GRRM is drawing comparisons between Sansa and Alysanne in things such as temperament, personality, life experiences etc. then he obviously wants us to connect the two. And one implication of this connection is that the <i>other things</i> about Alysanne\u2019s life that have yet to align with Sansa may be a hint for where she\u2019s headed and clue us in as to where her narrative is going. And that includes Alysanne\u2019s romantic arc - which matches up in many ways to Sansa\u2019s dynamic with Jon.</p><p>For example, besides all the blatant Sansa/Alysanne similarities inc. their personalities, affinity for the small folk, infamous beauty, charming \u2018<i>Queenly</i>\u2019 demeanour, both of them having 5 siblings, both of their families being hostages and captives during wartime, both of them watching their family die during conflict, and the way they both wore down even the most stubborn of Northern Lords due to sheer charm and courtesy (it\u2019s a ladies armour, after all) - also lmao at people really thinking she parallel\u2019s D*ny because dRaGoNs - I think GRRM is just a <i>tad</i> more nuanced than that, don\u2019t you?
