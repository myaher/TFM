        "answer": "<p><i><b>Spoilers!<br/></b></i><br/><a href=\"https://im-trash-bye.tumblr.com/post/180532636999/i-need-the-links-to-that-newest-fic-u-weote-u\" target=\"_blank\">That Damned Universe</a> was heavily inspired by a couple of books I once read, and I think it has a lot of meaning that goes under the radar of a lot of people, instead being registered subconsciously (the whole point of my writing, frankly). Here\u2019s a ridiculously in-depth rundown of each chapter, from the writer\u2019s point of view.<br/><br/><b>Chapter 1<br/></b><br/>The first chapter was meant to introduce the storyline, and show some exposition. Lincoln Academy was named after my elementary school, and is structured in a ridiculously unconventional manner, given the strong academic drive of the academy. We find out quickly that Cyrus, TJ, Andi, and Buffy all room in Stanford Dormitory along with the rest of the freshman class, and Amber is in Halsey. Halsey was named after my favorite building of the college in my hometown, while Stanford was after the university, where Cyrus would end up going to major in psychology if TDU extended that far.<br/><br/>I put Cyrus on the fourth floor and Andi and Buffy on the second for the sole purpose of creating conversational periods between characters as they go between one another\u2019s rooms or to and from classes. This set up the framework for TJ and Cyrus\u2019 first kiss later on.<br/><br/>I intentionally wrote Cyrus to react to his arrival at Lincoln with minimal homesickness for two reasons. The first, of course, is that Cyrus grew up with four incredibly overbearing but well-meaning parents, and he is eager to take a deep breath. The second is that Cyrus, as all characters and people must be, is a psychologically complex character, and his immediate lack of emotional displacement comes from that fact. He\u2019s so overwhelmed upon arriving at Lincoln that he doesn\u2019t have the time to catch his breath, let alone miss his parents.<br/><br/>Finally, the last line. TJ almost immediately tells Cyrus he finds him fascinating upon meeting him, which feels almost rushed, but was planned to feel as such. TJ\u2019s first impression of Cyrus is so sudden and rushed because he immediately likes Cyrus, and isn\u2019t quite sure how to express his emotions, so he naturally does his best to make Cyrus happy.<br/><br/><b>Chapter 2<br/></b><br/>The first line of the second chapter (Cyrus woke to his alarm, going off at exactly 5:55 am, as it always had - Cyrus was sure it always would.) is a representation of how Cyrus follows a schedule in his life that doesn\u2019t change, and he assumes it never will. However, in chapter 6, he doesn\u2019t wake to his alarm, because he\u2019d fallen asleep with TJ the night before. This was coded to imply that TJ teaches Cyrus to let himself be human and have a little more fun.<br/><br/>Cyrus wakes to TJ gone, because I wanted to show TJ\u2019s elusive nature early on in the story, then introduce his character a little bit later. His leaving confuses and intrigues Cyrus, effectively prompting him to get to know TJ better.<br/><br/>He spends an exorbitant amount of type getting ready on the first day of school, which was to further cement the notion that he\u2019s a touch over-specific in all areas of his life, especially when he\u2019s in a new, unfamiliar, or stressful environment (Lincoln Academy just so happens to be all three).<br/><br/>Their odd choice of cereal (both Rice Krispies and Cap'n Crunch) is a little reference to Gilmore Girls, in which Paris and Rory both make interesting and unique cereal and milk mixtures on a couple of occasions.<br/><br/>Cyrus\u2019s offhanded comment that TJ hates the universe is not only the root of the title, but a slight character development from TJ, giving him a human characteristic. This at the very least proves that Cyrus and TJ had a conversation of substance the night before, and had learned more than trivial things about one another.<br/><br/>Andi and Buffy lightheartedly making fun of him for his taste in unobtainable athletes was meant to allude to his crush on Jonah back home, and to show that he\u2019d grown more comfortable with his sexuality since coming out to them.<br/><br/>Lincoln\u2019s class periods are 40 minutes, with a 20-minute break between. This seems absurd at first, but later we\u2019ll find that classes constantly run lat, justifying the minor absurdity.<br/><br/>Cyrus and TJ\u2019s conversation between 5th and 6th period is meant to show their friendship and the way Cyrus affects TJ in a positive way. They joke back and forth naturally, complimenting one another and letting the conversation carry without trying too hard.<br/><br/><b>Chapter 3<br/></b><br/>This chapter follows my own change and interpretation of actual things from Andi Mack, turning some of my favorite pieces of the show in relation to Tyrus into my own plotlines. The first is, of course, TJ\u2019s acrimony towards Buffy. In the show, this is expressed as jealousy of her basketball skills, whereas I chose to change it into jealousy of her close relationship with Cyrus. TJ immediately leaving when Cyrus and Buffy walk into the dorm room is meant to further stabilize the notion that TJ thinks she and Cyrus are together, though at this point it hasn\u2019t been confirmed.<br/><br/>Buffy and Cyrus getting into a fight over his feelings for TJ shows that Cyrus isn\u2019t ready to admit how he feels. This also allows for TJ and Cyrus to become closer when Cyrus can\u2019t turn to Andi and Buffy for constant friendship.<br/><br/>Cyrus\u2019s conversation with TJ in the library is interesting, as the second TJ finds out that Cyrus and Buffy aren\u2019t dating, the conversation lightens. They\u2019re then able to have a conversation that moves along without the weight of their mutual awkwardness resting on it. Their academic banter throughout the conversation was meant to show that TJ and Cyrus were both highly academically minded, despite showing that trait in very different ways.<br/><br/>Cyrus being unable to stop himself from asking if TJ is okay shows two things about him and his relationship with TJ. The first is that Cyrus is the type of person who cannot refrain from helping others. He shows unconditional empathy for others, and those he loves are never free from his well-meaning comfort. The second thing this shows is that he has grown so comfortable with TJ in under 24 hours that he\u2019s willing to risk stepping possibly outside of his boundaries as an acquaintance/friend to ensure that TJ is going to be alright.<br/></p><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>All of Cyrus\u2019s teachers (Mr. Marlow, Madame Aguillard, Mr. Stile, Mrs. Elliot, Ms. Anderson, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Barnett, Mrs. Bailey) are slight variations of teachers I\u2019ve had this year or last, most of which teach the same subjects I had them for.<br/><br/>\n\nThis chapter has one last interpretation of a classic detail from Andi Mack - the muffin. Their exchange of sandwich for chocolate-chocolate chip muffin proves that they\u2019re friends, and care about one another enough to insist they have their favorite foods.\n\n<br/><br/>I chose for them to play a game of 20 questions as a way to reveal exposition without stating their backgrounds, interests, and hobbies point-blank. This also allowed me to build their relationship through verbal learning.<br/><br/>Marty being the friend who accidentally outed TJ let me introduce him to the story, and having him, Amber, Buffy and Andi rush into TJ and Cyrus\u2019s room let me introduce them to one another. <br/><br/>Amber and Andi\u2019s quickness to flirt with one another showed that TJ and Amber inadvertently learned about love in the same way - they both grew up learning from their parents that those you love can leave quickly. Thus, they both picked up a habit of quickly establishing a close relationship with those they\u2019re attracted to before they leave.<br/><br/><b>Chapter 5 </b><br/><br/>Cyrus wakes with a terrible headache the next day (and jokes with TJ about being hungover) because of the yelling and conflict the night before. I put this aspect in for two main reasons. One is, of course, showing that Cyrus can\u2019t stand conflict, and is consistently trying to resolve it. The second reason I put this bit into the story is so that I could allow TJ to minorly comfort Cyrus in a platonic (but romantically intentioned) manner.<br/><br/>Cyrus quickly saving TJ from having to out himself to Buffy and Andi was a move that I wrote in to show Cyrus\u2019s growing ability to cut into conversations and protect those he loves, as taught to him by TJ.<br/><br/>The small scene of TJ and Cyrus studying together exhibits the lighthearted, carefree side of their relationship that I thought was very important to introduce at some point in the story.<br/><br/>The romantic tension between Cyrus and TJ as the former helps TJ with his compass foreshadows their awkward encounter following their first kiss later on. When it ultimately built to them falling asleep holding pinkies, that was meant to show that they were each aware of their feelings for the other, but reluctant to show them.<br/><br/><b>Chapter 6<br/></b><br/>When Cyrus and TJ wake up the next morning, they\u2019re curled around one another, and it causes intense romantic tension between the pair as they go about starting the day.

            "comment": "<p><i><b>Spoilers!<br></b></i><br><a href=\"https://im-trash-bye.tumblr.com/post/180532636999/i-need-the-links-to-that-newest-fic-u-weote-u\" target=\"_blank\">That Damned Universe</a> was heavily inspired by a couple of books I once read, and I think it has a lot of meaning that goes under the radar of a lot of people, instead being registered subconsciously (the whole point of my writing, frankly). Here\u2019s a ridiculously in-depth rundown of each chapter, from the writer\u2019s point of view.<br><br><b>Chapter 1<br></b><br>The first chapter was meant to introduce the storyline, and show some exposition. Lincoln Academy was named after my elementary school, and is structured in a ridiculously unconventional manner, given the strong academic drive of the academy. We find out quickly that Cyrus, TJ, Andi, and Buffy all room in Stanford Dormitory along with the rest of the freshman class, and Amber is in Halsey. Halsey was named after my favorite building of the college in my hometown, while Stanford was after the university, where Cyrus would end up going to major in psychology if TDU extended that far.<br><br>I put Cyrus on the fourth floor and Andi and Buffy on the second for the sole purpose of creating conversational periods between characters as they go between one another\u2019s rooms or to and from classes. This set up the framework for TJ and Cyrus\u2019 first kiss later on.<br><br>I intentionally wrote Cyrus to react to his arrival at Lincoln with minimal homesickness for two reasons. The first, of course, is that Cyrus grew up with four incredibly overbearing but well-meaning parents, and he is eager to take a deep breath. The second is that Cyrus, as all characters and people must be, is a psychologically complex character, and his immediate lack of emotional displacement comes from that fact. He\u2019s so overwhelmed upon arriving at Lincoln that he doesn\u2019t have the time to catch his breath, let alone miss his parents.<br><br>Finally, the last line. TJ almost immediately tells Cyrus he finds him fascinating upon meeting him, which feels almost rushed, but was planned to feel as such. TJ\u2019s first impression of Cyrus is so sudden and rushed because he immediately likes Cyrus, and isn\u2019t quite sure how to express his emotions, so he naturally does his best to make Cyrus happy.<br><br><b>Chapter 2<br></b><br>The first line of the second chapter (Cyrus woke to his alarm, going off at exactly 5:55 am, as it always had - Cyrus was sure it always would.) is a representation of how Cyrus follows a schedule in his life that doesn\u2019t change, and he assumes it never will. However, in chapter 6, he doesn\u2019t wake to his alarm, because he\u2019d fallen asleep with TJ the night before. This was coded to imply that TJ teaches Cyrus to let himself be human and have a little more fun.<br><br>Cyrus wakes to TJ gone, because I wanted to show TJ\u2019s elusive nature early on in the story, then introduce his character a little bit later. His leaving confuses and intrigues Cyrus, effectively prompting him to get to know TJ better.<br><br>He spends an exorbitant amount of type getting ready on the first day of school, which was to further cement the notion that he\u2019s a touch over-specific in all areas of his life, especially when he\u2019s in a new, unfamiliar, or stressful environment (Lincoln Academy just so happens to be all three).<br><br>Their odd choice of cereal (both Rice Krispies and Cap'n Crunch) is a little reference to Gilmore Girls, in which Paris and Rory both make interesting and unique cereal and milk mixtures on a couple of occasions.<br><br>Cyrus\u2019s offhanded comment that TJ hates the universe is not only the root of the title, but a slight character development from TJ, giving him a human characteristic. This at the very least proves that Cyrus and TJ had a conversation of substance the night before, and had learned more than trivial things about one another.<br><br>Andi and Buffy lightheartedly making fun of him for his taste in unobtainable athletes was meant to allude to his crush on Jonah back home, and to show that he\u2019d grown more comfortable with his sexuality since coming out to them.<br><br>Lincoln\u2019s class periods are 40 minutes, with a 20-minute break between. This seems absurd at first, but later we\u2019ll find that classes constantly run lat, justifying the minor absurdity.<br><br>Cyrus and TJ\u2019s conversation between 5th and 6th period is meant to show their friendship and the way Cyrus affects TJ in a positive way. They joke back and forth naturally, complimenting one another and letting the conversation carry without trying too hard.<br><br><b>Chapter 3<br></b><br>This chapter follows my own change and interpretation of actual things from Andi Mack, turning some of my favorite pieces of the show in relation to Tyrus into my own plotlines. The first is, of course, TJ\u2019s acrimony towards Buffy. In the show, this is expressed as jealousy of her basketball skills, whereas I chose to change it into jealousy of her close relationship with Cyrus. TJ immediately leaving when Cyrus and Buffy walk into the dorm room is meant to further stabilize the notion that TJ thinks she and Cyrus are together, though at this point it hasn\u2019t been confirmed.<br><br>Buffy and Cyrus getting into a fight over his feelings for TJ shows that Cyrus isn\u2019t ready to admit how he feels. This also allows for TJ and Cyrus to become closer when Cyrus can\u2019t turn to Andi and Buffy for constant friendship.<br><br>Cyrus\u2019s conversation with TJ in the library is interesting, as the second TJ finds out that Cyrus and Buffy aren\u2019t dating, the conversation lightens. They\u2019re then able to have a conversation that moves along without the weight of their mutual awkwardness resting on it. Their academic banter throughout the conversation was meant to show that TJ and Cyrus were both highly academically minded, despite showing that trait in very different ways.<br><br>Cyrus being unable to stop himself from asking if TJ is okay shows two things about him and his relationship with TJ. The first is that Cyrus is the type of person who cannot refrain from helping others. He shows unconditional empathy for others, and those he loves are never free from his well-meaning comfort. The second thing this shows is that he has grown so comfortable with TJ in under 24 hours that he\u2019s willing to risk stepping possibly outside of his boundaries as an acquaintance/friend to ensure that TJ is going to be alright.<br></p><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>All of Cyrus\u2019s teachers (Mr. Marlow, Madame Aguillard, Mr. Stile, Mrs. Elliot, Ms. Anderson, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Barnett, Mrs. Bailey) are slight variations of teachers I\u2019ve had this year or last, most of which teach the same subjects I had them for.<br><br>\n\nThis chapter has one last interpretation of a classic detail from Andi Mack - the muffin. Their exchange of sandwich for chocolate-chocolate chip muffin proves that they\u2019re friends, and care about one another enough to insist they have their favorite foods.\n\n<br><br>I chose for them to play a game of 20 questions as a way to reveal exposition without stating their backgrounds, interests, and hobbies point-blank. This also allowed me to build their relationship through verbal learning.<br><br>Marty being the friend who accidentally outed TJ let me introduce him to the story, and having him, Amber, Buffy and Andi rush into TJ and Cyrus\u2019s room let me introduce them to one another. <br><br>Amber and Andi\u2019s quickness to flirt with one another showed that TJ and Amber inadvertently learned about love in the same way - they both grew up learning from their parents that those you love can leave quickly. Thus, they both picked up a habit of quickly establishing a close relationship with those they\u2019re attracted to before they leave.<br><br><b>Chapter 5 </b><br><br>Cyrus wakes with a terrible headache the next day (and jokes with TJ about being hungover) because of the yelling and conflict the night before. I put this aspect in for two main reasons. One is, of course, showing that Cyrus can\u2019t stand conflict, and is consistently trying to resolve it. The second reason I put this bit into the story is so that I could allow TJ to minorly comfort Cyrus in a platonic (but romantically intentioned) manner.<br><br>Cyrus quickly saving TJ from having to out himself to Buffy and Andi was a move that I wrote in to show Cyrus\u2019s growing ability to cut into conversations and protect those he loves, as taught to him by TJ.<br><br>The small scene of TJ and Cyrus studying together exhibits the lighthearted, carefree side of their relationship that I thought was very important to introduce at some point in the story.<br><br>The romantic tension between Cyrus and TJ as the former helps TJ with his compass foreshadows their awkward encounter following their first kiss later on. When it ultimately built to them falling asleep holding pinkies, that was meant to show that they were each aware of their feelings for the other, but reluctant to show them.<br><br><b>Chapter 6<br></b><br>When Cyrus and TJ wake up the next morning, they\u2019re curled around one another, and it causes intense romantic tension between the pair as they go about starting the day. This ends when they go back and forth in a short exchange of \u2018I wasn\u2019t\u2019 and \u2018well neither was I\u2019. <br><br>TJ tries to kiss Cyrus, but they\u2019re interrupted by a phone call.

This at the very least proves that Cyrus and TJ had a conversation of substance the night before, and had learned more than trivial things about one another.<br /><br />Andi and Buffy lightheartedly making fun of him for his taste in unobtainable athletes was meant to allude to his crush on Jonah back home, and to show that he&rsquo;d grown more comfortable with his sexuality since coming out to them.<br /><br />Lincoln&rsquo;s class periods are 40 minutes, with a 20-minute break between. This seems absurd at first, but later we&rsquo;ll find that classes constantly run lat, justifying the minor absurdity.<br /><br />Cyrus and TJ&rsquo;s conversation between 5th and 6th period is meant to show their friendship and the way Cyrus affects TJ in a positive way. They joke back and forth naturally, complimenting one another and letting the conversation carry without trying too hard.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 3<br /></b><br />This chapter follows my own change and interpretation of actual things from Andi Mack, turning some of my favorite pieces of the show in relation to Tyrus into my own plotlines. The first is, of course, TJ&rsquo;s acrimony towards Buffy. In the show, this is expressed as jealousy of her basketball skills, whereas I chose to change it into jealousy of her close relationship with Cyrus. TJ immediately leaving when Cyrus and Buffy walk into the dorm room is meant to further stabilize the notion that TJ thinks she and Cyrus are together, though at this point it hasn&rsquo;t been confirmed.<br /><br />Buffy and Cyrus getting into a fight over his feelings for TJ shows that Cyrus isn&rsquo;t ready to admit how he feels. This also allows for TJ and Cyrus to become closer when Cyrus can&rsquo;t turn to Andi and Buffy for constant friendship.<br /><br />Cyrus&rsquo;s conversation with TJ in the library is interesting, as the second TJ finds out that Cyrus and Buffy aren&rsquo;t dating, the conversation lightens. They&rsquo;re then able to have a conversation that moves along without the weight of their mutual awkwardness resting on it. Their academic banter throughout the conversation was meant to show that TJ and Cyrus were both highly academically minded, despite showing that trait in very different ways.<br /><br />Cyrus being unable to stop himself from asking if TJ is okay shows two things about him and his relationship with TJ. The first is that Cyrus is the type of person who cannot refrain from helping others. He shows unconditional empathy for others, and those he loves are never free from his well-meaning comfort. The second thing this shows is that he has grown so comfortable with TJ in under 24 hours that he&rsquo;s willing to risk stepping possibly outside of his boundaries as an acquaintance/friend to ensure that TJ is going to be alright.<br /></p><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>All of Cyrus&rsquo;s teachers (Mr. Marlow, Madame Aguillard, Mr. Stile, Mrs. Elliot, Ms. Anderson, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Barnett, Mrs. Bailey) are slight variations of teachers I&rsquo;ve had this year or last, most of which teach the same subjects I had them for.<br /><br />\n\nThis chapter has one last interpretation of a classic detail from Andi Mack - the muffin. Their exchange of sandwich for chocolate-chocolate chip muffin proves that they&rsquo;re friends, and care about one another enough to insist they have their favorite foods.\n\n<br /><br />I chose for them to play a game of 20 questions as a way to reveal exposition without stating their backgrounds, interests, and hobbies point-blank. This also allowed me to build their relationship through verbal learning.<br /><br />Marty being the friend who accidentally outed TJ let me introduce him to the story, and having him, Amber, Buffy and Andi rush into TJ and Cyrus&rsquo;s room let me introduce them to one another. <br /><br />Amber and Andi&rsquo;s quickness to flirt with one another showed that TJ and Amber inadvertently learned about love in the same way - they both grew up learning from their parents that those you love can leave quickly. Thus, they both picked up a habit of quickly establishing a close relationship with those they&rsquo;re attracted to before they leave.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 5 </b><br /><br />Cyrus wakes with a terrible headache the next day (and jokes with TJ about being hungover) because of the yelling and conflict the night before. I put this aspect in for two main reasons. One is, of course, showing that Cyrus can&rsquo;t stand conflict, and is consistently trying to resolve it. The second reason I put this bit into the story is so that I could allow TJ to minorly comfort Cyrus in a platonic (but romantically intentioned) manner.<br /><br />Cyrus quickly saving TJ from having to out himself to Buffy and Andi was a move that I wrote in to show Cyrus&rsquo;s growing ability to cut into conversations and protect those he loves, as taught to him by TJ.<br /><br />The small scene of TJ and Cyrus studying together exhibits the lighthearted, carefree side of their relationship that I thought was very important to introduce at some point in the story.<br /><br />The romantic tension between Cyrus and TJ as the former helps TJ with his compass foreshadows their awkward encounter following their first kiss later on. When it ultimately built to them falling asleep holding pinkies, that was meant to show that they were each aware of their feelings for the other, but reluctant to show them.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 6<br /></b><br />When Cyrus and TJ wake up the next morning, they&rsquo;re curled around one another, and it causes intense romantic tension between the pair as they go about starting the day. This ends when they go back and forth in a short exchange of &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t&rsquo; and &lsquo;well neither was I&rsquo;. <br /><br />TJ tries to kiss Cyrus, but they&rsquo;re interrupted by a phone call. This signifies the awkward, fumbling nature of the relationship, especially as they go to help Andi. Their acknowledgment of the awkwardness between them is a huge step in their relationship, which ultimately leads to their first kiss.<br /><br />Their argument in the stairwell being the lead up to their kiss was a choice I made because in the heat of an argument, emotions are heightened. This was important for the scene to work, as if they hadn&rsquo;t been arguing, neither would have the courage to kiss the other.<br /><br /><b>Final Chapter<br /></b><br />I had Cyrus start the seventh chapter regretting his kiss with TJ to drive the plot. This forced TJ and him to have an actual conversation about what exactly their relationship was at the end of the chapter.<br /><br />Honestly, there were only two reasons I made Buffy aroace. First, I&rsquo;m ace and I wanted representation, so I took the opportunity when it arose. Second, I wanted to tease you guys with Muffy (anyone paying really close attention to AO3 will have noticed that I tagged TDU as a Marty/Buffy fic, then took away the tag for the last chapter).<br /><br />Cyrus wagering his asking TJ out for Andi doing the same with Amber was a way for me to close the Ambi storyline in a satisfactory way without dedicating an entire chapter exclusively to it.<br /><br />The mini-monologue of Cyrus deciding whether or not to kiss TJ was one I&rsquo;d been writing in my head since beginning to write TDU, and completed the fic in a way that was so characteristic of my writing that I couldn&rsquo;t help but throw it in just to make the story feel completely finished. <br /></p>",

No it will not be 12 parts long, it will be 6 so I shall post every second day! Also I will be including almost all of the prompts for the 12 days within this story!\u00a0</p><p>Incase it is unclear the days mentioned are the sixth and seventh night of Hanukkah (the Saturday and second Sunday)</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16968102/chapters/39879168\">Read on ao3</a></p><h2><b>Chapter One:</b> Hanukkah</h2><p><b>Word Count:</b> 3538</p><hr><p>It\u2019s early in the afternoon on a cold Saturday in December. Cyrus is out braving the frosty bite in the air after his mother requested he run to the grocery store to pick up a few last minute things before they go to her parents house for a quiet Hanukkah celebration.</p><p>Cyrus is juggling a grocery bag in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other when he spots TJ further up the street walking in his direction. TJ is lightly bopping along to whatever music is playing in the headphones he wears, his Jackson Street Gym shirt is framed by an unzipped sweatshirt that swings gently as he moves. Cyrus smiles at the sight of TJ even though he hadn\u2019t noticed him in return. As they near each other, TJ looks up to smile at the passerby and realises who it is. </p><p>\u201cCyrus.\u201d TJ sounds pleasantly surprised. He pulls the headphones out and wears a smile that reaches his eyes. </p><p>\u201cFunny running into you here.\u201d Cyrus greets him with a wide grin of his own. </p><p>\u201cOn the corner of Jackson Street, where I work.\u201d TJ says with a smirk, \u201cA real coincidence I\u2019m sure.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not stalking you.\u201d Cyrus jokes with a soft chuckle before giving a playful look as if to say, \u2018or am I?&rsquo;</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking you were lingering outside my work ready to bring me flowers.\u201d TJ jokes as he motions to the bouquet Cyrus holds. TJ\u2019s look of mock offence makes Cyrus laugh further. Once the chuckles tapers off, TJ shifts almost nervously on his feet, \u201cSo,\u201d TJ says with his eyes resting on the bouquet again before flicking his stare back to Cyrus\u2019, \u201cYou got a date or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Cyrus exaggerates a smirk as he nods, \u201cShe\u2019s an older woman. Like seventy years older,\u201d Cyrus cant keep a straight face anymore, \u201cShe\u2019s my grandma.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s expression scrunches at the joke and he shakes his head with a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus smiles, \u201cWe\u2019re going to see my mom\u2019s parents tonight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Hanukkah?\u201d TJ questions and Cyrus bops his head even though it was rhetorical. \u201cSo is tonight like the big night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head, \u201cWe\u2019re just having a quiet night at their house.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo when is the main day?\u201d TJ asks. \u201cI know Hanukkah is eight nights but is it the last one that\u2019s the biggest?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus fights the urge to smile and TJ notices, \u201cOh no, have I said something stupid?\u201d TJ frowns and drops his gaze to his shoes with embarrassment. </p><p>Cyrus wears a kind smile. \u201cLighting the menorah and saying the blessings each night is more or less the same but it\u2019s not like halloween or Christmas where everything builds up to one big celebration. Some families make a bigger deal out of the last night than they do the other seven but for a lot it\u2019s just family time during Hanukkah, some nights might be bigger than others. For me it really just depends on what family we\u2019re seeing on the day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ says and he appears to be genuinely interested in what Cyrus had to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t really know that\u2026 I guess if I\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t really know much about Hanukkah at all.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus was used to people not understanding his traditions as Hanukkah tended to fade into the background as everyone gets into the Christmas spirit. Cyrus was also used to having to explain Hanukkah to different people, he actually kind of liked it because it meant he got to talk about his favourite time of year. Cyrus especially liked getting his friends involved in Hanukkah. </p><p>\u201cWell if you wanted to understand it a little better you\u2019re welcome to come over one night this Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus politely invites TJ. </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ seems surprised, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be like, intruding or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way. My mom loves when I bring my friends over for Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus beams. </p><p>\u201cOkay. That sounds really cool.\u201d TJ nods. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow night at my mom\u2019s house?\u201d Cyrus asks. \u201cI mean you can come with me to my grandma\u2019s tonight but she\u2019s a cheek pincher.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u2028TJ rolls his head forward with a chuckle. \u201cTomorrow night.\u201d He nods with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m there.\u201d<br/></p><p>- </p><p>The following day, Cyrus is all too happy to dress in the sweater his mom laid out for him to wear whilst indulging in an evening with family. As the night unfolds, Cyrus&rsquo; mom\u2019s home fills with faces of people he loves. Cyrus sits on the floor of the living room with his two younger brothers, Mason - Todd\u2019s son from a previous marriage\u00a0and Noah - Sharon and Norman\u2019s son -\u00a0as they teach Cyrus a new game they made up using the dreidel. Cyrus had previously taught them both how to play properly but the young boys found it more interesting to make up their own set of rules and Cyrus was happy to go along with it. </p><p>Although Cyrus was enjoying the quality time with his young siblings, he couldn\u2019t help but repeatedly check his watch as he eagerly awaits the arrival of TJ. The doorbell rings and Cyrus springs up from his position and looks around embarrassed thinking he might have raised suspicion amongst his family members. Although the older adults didn\u2019t seem to be alerted, Cyrus\u2019 two younger brothers looked up at him with pouty faces. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back to play soon.\u201d Cyrus gives them both a crooked smile, \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I wont notice you taking jellybeans from my pile!\u201d Cyrus gives them a playfully stern look each before making his way to the front door where his father, Norman has already answered it.</p><p>\u201cIs it-\u201c Cyrus deflates when he realises it\u2019s his older stepbrother - also from Todd\u2019s previous marriage - and his girlfriend, \u201cOh hi, Jared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGee, Cy, I\u2019m really glad to see you too.\u201d Jared jokes sarcastically before lunging forward and pinning Cyrus in a headlock. </p><p>\u201cThis is exactly why I\u2019m never excited to see you.\u201d Cyrus groans as he tries to wriggle free but Jared\u2019s grip is too strong and Cyrus is subjected to an all too familiar hair ruffle. </p><p>\u201cGive Cy a break.\u201d Allison, Jared\u2019s girlfriend says with a soft giggle as she steps around them and into the house. </p><p>Cyrus could hear his father chuckling at the sight before he left to escort Allison into the festivities. Cyrus continues to wrestle with Jared and the pair end up out on the porch. The two circle as Cyrus struggles to free himself and when Cyrus spins towards the street his gaze catches a confused looking TJ at the bottom of the porch steps. Jared and Cyrus both stop the struggle when they spot the basketball captain although Jared doesn\u2019t release Cyrus from his grip. </p><p>\u201cHey, you made it.\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously in his stepbrothers headlock. \u201cTJ, this is my brother Jared, Jared, this is my friend TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ lets out a quiet chuckle and sends a wave in Jared\u2019s direction. </p><p>Jared gives Cyrus\u2019 hair another ruffle before finally releasing him with an amused smirk as Cyrus scrambles to fix his do.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Jared grins at TJ before turning to Cyrus, \u201cI\u2019m going to go find my dad and say hello.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMeet you in there, jerk.\u201d Cyrus grumbles as he straightens up his outfit. </p><p>\u201cSuddenly I\u2019m glad I\u2019m the older brother in my family.\u201d TJ jokes as he makes his way up the porch steps. </p><p>\u201cJared loves to torment me.\u201d Cyrus says feeling lightly embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your stepbrother, right?\u201d TJ questions.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s Todd\u2019s son from his first marriage.\u201d Cyrus explains. </p><p>\u201cSo does that mean Mason is here too?\u201d TJ asks and Cyrus\u2019 expression curls into one of surprise. </p><p>\u201cYou know Mason?\u201d Cyrus asks, he knew TJ had met his parents before but he didn\u2019t know he had met his stepbrother.</p><p>\u201cAnd Noah, of course.\u201d TJ nods casually but then smiles at Cyrus\u2019 rather adorable look of confusion. \u201cI officially knew one other person at your Bar Mitzvah party and Buffy hated me back then,\u201d TJ chuckles, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t aggravating Buffy I was talking to random people, most of them were your family.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOr when you weren\u2019t helping me open tricky bottles of apple cider.\u201d Cyrus smiles back fondly on the memory. </p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d TJ smiles too. \u201cYour Aunt Ruth- Very chatty by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d Cyrus says to himself more than TJ, \u201cAunt Ruth isn\u2019t here tonight but Mason is, he\u2019s inside playing with Noah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d TJ questions. \u201cIsn\u2019t Noah your dad and Sharon\u2019s son?\u201d TJ knowing this wasn\u2019t as surprising as TJ had officially met Noah before as he had hung out at Cyrus\u2019 fathers house. </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus nods, \u201cThey\u2019re both inside too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, so all four of your parents are here?\u201d TJ looks surprised. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cyrus beams with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019ve come for my favourite night of Hanukkah.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; family might not put importance into one single night of Hanukkah but this was certainly Cyrus\u2019 favourite one because without fail every year he\u2019d get one night with his divorced parents together and since their new marriages it would be all four of his parents along with his mix of step and half brothers. Now having TJ be apart of it made the night feel extra special for Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Cyrus ushers TJ in with a grin. </p><p>\u201cI like your sweater by the way.\u201d TJ says as he follows Cyrus.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Cyrus grins,\u00a0\u201cLook, I can light the candles-\u201d Cyrus lights the flames of the menorah on his sweater via their reversible sequins. This makes TJ chuckle fondly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Once inside, Cyrus brings TJ to the kitchen where his four parents gathered with Jared and Allison. They each politely greet TJ and make him instantly feel welcomed. </p><p>\u201cThank you for having me here tonight.\u201d TJ smiles at Leslie. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help, just let me know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you dear but you\u2019re fine, you two go off and have some fun.\u201d Leslie\u2019s smile is kind, \u201cDinner shouldn\u2019t be too far off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can hang out in my room.\u201d Cyrus says with a grin but before the two could get past the living room he\u2019s nearly tackled by Mason and Noah. </p><p>TJ gives them both a happy high-five each which visually cements in Cyrus\u2019 mind that TJ had previously interacted with them both prior to tonight. </p><p>\u201cYou said you were coming back to play?\u201d Mason looks hopeful. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Cyrus furrows his brows, \u201cBut TJ and I were going to hang out\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play.\u201d TJ wears a goofy smile, \u201cBut someone\u2019s going to have to teach me the rules.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus turns to give TJ and \u2018are you sure?\u2019 look but he\u2019s already crouching down to sit with the children. Cyrus joins the three and looks at his pile of jellybeans which has seemed to diminish in his absence. </p><p>Cyrus quickly explains to TJ what the dreidel is and what is written on each side.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re letters from the Hebrew alphabet, Nun, Gimel, Hei and Shin. Together they make an acronym, nes gadol haya sham which translates to-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA great miracle happened there.\u201d Mason excitedly finishes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Cyrus smiles at his younger brother.\u00a0\u201cSo you were listening when I taught you how to play?\u201d Cyrus turns back to TJ,\u00a0\u201cThe miracle being-\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cA one day supply of oil lasting eight days.\u201d This time is TJ that cuts in proudly with an answer.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus coaxes his head in bewilderment.\u00a0\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know much about Hanukkah?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d TJ admits,\u00a0\u201cBut I did some research last night.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 smile creeps wider.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ just gives Cyrus a small smile before turning his attention to the two youngsters that are patiently waiting to play the game.\u00a0\u201cRight, so how do I play?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I explained what the dreidel really says but Mason and Noah have made up their own meanings.\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cEach side is a colour corresponding with a colour of jellybean&hellip;\u201d Cyrus goes on to explain the new game and the four of them get quite competitive as they play. They continue right through until Sharon lets them know that dinner is ready.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d TJ jumps up from his place and makes his way over to the table. \u00a0Cyrus watches TJ with a smile as he approaches the table and he looks to Leslie as if to ask her permission. Leslie picks up on it and tells TJ to sit wherever he likes.</p><p>\u201cI want to sit next to TJ!\u201d Mason comes charging over.</p><p>\u201cNo I want to sit next to TJ!\u201d Noah rushes over too.</p><p>\u201cHey, good thing I have two sides.\u201d TJ shares a goofy grin between the two.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d Cyrus looks over at them with a frown. \u201cWhat if I wanted to sit next to TJ?\u201d</p><p>TJ gives Cyrus an unapologetic shrug.</p><p>You can sit next to me my little cookie pie.\u201d Leslie squeezes Cyrus into a side hug.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mom!</i>\u201d Cyrus groans embarrassed. TJ chuckles softly and with rosy cheeks Cyrus joins his mother at the table, he ends up directly across from TJ with his mother on one side and his father on the other.<br/></p><p>Dinner unfolds and the vibe in the room is joyous. The adults quiz Allison and Jared about their college studies, Mason and Noah take up most of TJ\u2019s attention whilst Cyrus sits back and happily watches his family and friend.\u00a0</p><p>Leslie explains a few of the foods to TJ incase they were foreign to him but the basketballer ate everything seemingly without question. Then it\u2019s Cyrus\u2019 father who turns his attention - and subsequently the attention in the room - towards TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, are you and your family planning anything special for the holidays?\u201d Norman asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing special,\u201d TJ grows sheepish, \u201cSort of just waiting for them to be over\u2026\u201d\u00a0TJ\u2019s last statement struck Cyrus as odd and the basketball captain did his best to avoid Cyrus\u2019 quizzical gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a big Christmas fan?\u201d Norman further questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d TJ shrugs in place. </p><p>\u201cAt least the break off school will be nice.\u201d Norman smiles trying to make TJ feel more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s something to look forward to.\u201d TJ smiles. </p><p>\u201cTJ, if you\u2019re not doing anything your family you\u2019re welcome to join us on our ski trip this year.\u201d Leslie says genuinely and Cyrus\u2019 excitement level soared.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ seems surprised.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh course.\u201d Leslie smiles.\u00a0\u201cAndi and Buffy are both coming this year too and Jonah is still waiting for his parents to decide.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ appears to look uncertain as he finds Cyrus\u2019 stare across the table.\u00a0\u201cIt will be so much fun.\u201d Cyrus nods his approval.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSays the lousy skier.\u201d Jared teases from further down the table.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLeave Cyrus alone.\u201d Todd scolds his oldest son.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure Jared will be more polite during the drive to the lodge.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ thanks both Leslie and Todd for the invite and says he\u2019ll speak to his mother about it when he goes home.\u00a0</p><p>Once everyone is full from dinner - although they each know desserts were still to come - Todd leads the group in lighting the menorahs. The family gather around at the front of the house where a few menorahs were sat on a table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one?\u201d TJ questions quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that one is mine.\u201d Cyrus matches TJ\u2019s soft tone as he points out his one.</p><p>Todd holds the matches and lights each shamash either an adult or child was holding. Everyone starts to say the blessing. TJ had been given a sheet of paper so he could try and follow along, which for the most part he did but the boy looked extremely lost and a little embarrassed by his attempts. During the second blessing Cyrus gives TJ an encouraging smile for his efforts and this seems to put him a little more at ease.\u00a0</p><p>After Cyrus lit the first candle he goes to pass the shamash to TJ who seems panicked.\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d TJ mumbles to Cyrus as if Cyrus\u2019 entire family wasn\u2019t watching them.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus again smiles encouragingly and hands the shamash to TJ, their fingers brushing against each others in the process. Although he was sheepish, TJ rather proudly lights the next candle. The two middle schoolers exchange a warm smile afterwards. The two continue to take turns lighting the next candle on Cyrus\u2019 menorah.</p><p>After the menorah lighting is complete everyone makes their way back towards the living and dining area for a more informal desert.\u00a0</p><p>TJ throughly enjoys a good helping of the\u00a0sufganiyot\u00a0although he has to revert to calling them doughnuts as he butchered the name.\u00a0</p><p>After a night full of family, friends and filling food, Leslie wraps up two extra sufganiyots\u00a0for TJ to take home to his twin siblings.<br/></p><p>It\u2019s not until Cyrus is walking TJ out for the night that they finally get a moment alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to light the extra candle now.\u201d TJ steps forward and uses his index finger to\u00a0\u2018light\u2019 the sequins on the next candle of Cyrus\u2019 sweater. This gesture made Cyrus\u2019 skin tickle with goosebumps and he was thankful his Hanukkah sweater concealed them.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee these are going to be given to the twins,\u201d TJ laughs as he holds his wrapped desserts,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re <i>so</i> good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been eating them all week, I\u2019m going to turn into one if I\u2019m not careful.\u201d Cyrus jokes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me tonight.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks for coming, sorry my brothers bothered you all night.\u201d Cyrus apologises.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo bother at all.\u201d TJ insists,\u00a0\u201cI had a lot of fun.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou did come for my favourite night.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 smile is small but full of warmth.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause all your parents come together for it?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Cyrus nods.\u00a0\u201cEvery year during Hanukkah I bounce around between mom and dads houses. Extended family on both sides come into town or sometimes we\u2019ll go and see them but every year without fail there is one night of Hanukkah where all four of my parents get together and we have a big celebration.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor a divorced couple your parents get along really well.\u201d TJ lightly kicks the ground and something about it felt like TJ had spoken a thought out loud. \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMy dad makes a few digs at Todd here and there but he is only ever joking,\u201d Cyrus lets out a single laugh,\u00a0\u201cMy mom is his best friend.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow often does that happen for split couples?\u201d TJ looks away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d Cyrus acknowledges,\u00a0\u201cMy parents were high school sweethearts and they got married right after college and then had me. I think they both denied it for a while but they weren&rsquo;t in love anymore - although they constantly assure me I was born out of love -\u201d Cyrus pauses to laugh before continuing,\u00a0\u201cThey split up when I was two but I don\u2019t really remember that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou have a really nice family.\u201d TJ\u2019s smile is soft.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019ll get to spend more time with us on the ski trip - well my mom, Todd and Jared.\u201d Cyrus corrects,\u00a0\u201cMason will be with his mom.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to come to that.\u201d TJ shakes his head.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBut I want you to come,\u201d Cyrus frowns,\u00a0\u201cOnly if you want to come that is..\u201d Cyrus adds quickly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYour mom invited me, you invited your friends.\u201d TJ is shy as they broach the subject,\u00a0\u201cIt kind of feels like a pity invite.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is at all.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 frown deepens at TJ even having the thought,\u00a0\u201cI asked my mom if we could invite you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d TJ seems unsure.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cyrus is genuine,\u00a0\u201cI was going to talk to you about it tonight but my mom beat me to it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d TJ shrugs a shoulder and Cyrus didn\u2019t like that TJ still didn\u2019t believe him but he decides not to push it much more, instead Cyrus gives TJ some information to take back to his parents.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo mom, Todd and I will be going on the 24th and then Jared who\u2019s spending Christmas with his girlfriend will be driving to the lodge on the 26th. He\u2019s taking Buffy, Andi - and Jonah if he\u2019s allowed - in his car.\u201d Cyrus explains,\u00a0\u201cJared is a pain in the neck but he\u2019s a safe driver. Your parents can talk to my mom and Todd about it if they\u2019re unsure.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u00a0I\u2019ll speak to my mom about it.\u201d TJ nods and a car pulling up interrupts them both, \u201cThat\u2019s my mom, I have to go.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cRemember to ask about the ski trip.\u201d Cyrus adds eagerly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d TJ nods,\u00a0\u201cThanks again for inviting me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watches as TJ disappears down the street in his mothers car. Cyrus can\u2019t help but reflect on TJ\u2019s off mood during that conversation.\u00a0Cyrus\u2019 insecurities would normally lead him to believe that this was because someone like TJ wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with someone like himself but Cyrus knew that wasn\u2019t\u00a0the case, Cyrus believed TJ genuinely didn&rsquo;t understand that Cyrus <i>really</i> wanted him there.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus remains alone out in the cold December air for a while longer and he finds himself wishing TJ knew how much he meant to him.\u00a0</p><hr><p><b>End notes: </b><i>Day one complete!!!!!!! </i>Firstly I want to say thank you to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZgtMmIBrKcNcCZcLugBtHQ\">@malepresentingleg</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m21CDz26bsh5wb7-nbhHisQ\">@scarybasketballguy</a> for letting me quiz their big beautiful brains about Hanukkah!

Cyrus is out braving the frosty bite in the air after his mother requested he run to the grocery store to pick up a few last minute things before they go to her parents house for a quiet Hanukkah celebration.</p><p>Cyrus is juggling a grocery bag in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other when he spots TJ further up the street walking in his direction. TJ is lightly bopping along to whatever music is playing in the headphones he wears, his Jackson Street Gym shirt is framed by an unzipped sweatshirt that swings gently as he moves. Cyrus smiles at the sight of TJ even though he hadn\u2019t noticed him in return. As they near each other, TJ looks up to smile at the passerby and realises who it is. </p><p>\u201cCyrus.\u201d TJ sounds pleasantly surprised. He pulls the headphones out and wears a smile that reaches his eyes. </p><p>\u201cFunny running into you here.\u201d Cyrus greets him with a wide grin of his own. </p><p>\u201cOn the corner of Jackson Street, where I work.\u201d TJ says with a smirk, \u201cA real coincidence I\u2019m sure.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not stalking you.\u201d Cyrus jokes with a soft chuckle before giving a playful look as if to say, \u2018or am I?\u2019</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking you were lingering outside my work ready to bring me flowers.\u201d TJ jokes as he motions to the bouquet Cyrus holds. TJ\u2019s look of mock offence makes Cyrus laugh further. Once the chuckles tapers off, TJ shifts almost nervously on his feet, \u201cSo,\u201d TJ says with his eyes resting on the bouquet again before flicking his stare back to Cyrus\u2019, \u201cYou got a date or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Cyrus exaggerates a smirk as he nods, \u201cShe\u2019s an older woman. Like seventy years older,\u201d Cyrus cant keep a straight face anymore, \u201cShe\u2019s my grandma.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s expression scrunches at the joke and he shakes his head with a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus smiles, \u201cWe\u2019re going to see my mom\u2019s parents tonight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Hanukkah?\u201d TJ questions and Cyrus bops his head even though it was rhetorical. \u201cSo is tonight like the big night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head, \u201cWe\u2019re just having a quiet night at their house.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo when is the main day?\u201d TJ asks. \u201cI know Hanukkah is eight nights but is it the last one that\u2019s the biggest?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus fights the urge to smile and TJ notices, \u201cOh no, have I said something stupid?\u201d TJ frowns and drops his gaze to his shoes with embarrassment. </p><p>Cyrus wears a kind smile. \u201cLighting the menorah and saying the blessings each night is more or less the same but it\u2019s not like halloween or Christmas where everything builds up to one big celebration. Some families make a bigger deal out of the last night than they do the other seven but for a lot it\u2019s just family time during Hanukkah, some nights might be bigger than others. For me it really just depends on what family we\u2019re seeing on the day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ says and he appears to be genuinely interested in what Cyrus had to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t really know that\u2026 I guess if I\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t really know much about Hanukkah at all.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus was used to people not understanding his traditions as Hanukkah tended to fade into the background as everyone gets into the Christmas spirit. Cyrus was also used to having to explain Hanukkah to different people, he actually kind of liked it because it meant he got to talk about his favourite time of year. Cyrus especially liked getting his friends involved in Hanukkah. </p><p>\u201cWell if you wanted to understand it a little better you\u2019re welcome to come over one night this Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus politely invites TJ. </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ seems surprised, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be like, intruding or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way. My mom loves when I bring my friends over for Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus beams. </p><p>\u201cOkay. That sounds really cool.\u201d TJ nods. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow night at my mom\u2019s house?\u201d Cyrus asks. \u201cI mean you can come with me to my grandma\u2019s tonight but she\u2019s a cheek pincher.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u2028TJ rolls his head forward with a chuckle. \u201cTomorrow night.\u201d He nods with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m there.\u201d<br></p><p>- </p><p>The following day, Cyrus is all too happy to dress in the sweater his mom laid out for him to wear whilst indulging in an evening with family. As the night unfolds, Cyrus\u2019 mom\u2019s home fills with faces of people he loves. Cyrus sits on the floor of the living room with his two younger brothers, Mason - Todd\u2019s son from a previous marriage\u00a0and Noah - Sharon and Norman\u2019s son -\u00a0as they teach Cyrus a new game they made up using the dreidel. Cyrus had previously taught them both how to play properly but the young boys found it more interesting to make up their own set of rules and Cyrus was happy to go along with it. </p><p>Although Cyrus was enjoying the quality time with his young siblings, he couldn\u2019t help but repeatedly check his watch as he eagerly awaits the arrival of TJ. The doorbell rings and Cyrus springs up from his position and looks around embarrassed thinking he might have raised suspicion amongst his family members. Although the older adults didn\u2019t seem to be alerted, Cyrus\u2019 two younger brothers looked up at him with pouty faces. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back to play soon.\u201d Cyrus gives them both a crooked smile, \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I wont notice you taking jellybeans from my pile!\u201d Cyrus gives them a playfully stern look each before making his way to the front door where his father, Norman has already answered it.</p><p>\u201cIs it-\u201c Cyrus deflates when he realises it\u2019s his older stepbrother - also from Todd\u2019s previous marriage - and his girlfriend, \u201cOh hi, Jared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGee, Cy, I\u2019m really glad to see you too.\u201d Jared jokes sarcastically before lunging forward and pinning Cyrus in a headlock. </p><p>\u201cThis is exactly why I\u2019m never excited to see you.\u201d Cyrus groans as he tries to wriggle free but Jared\u2019s grip is too strong and Cyrus is subjected to an all too familiar hair ruffle. </p><p>\u201cGive Cy a break.\u201d Allison, Jared\u2019s girlfriend says with a soft giggle as she steps around them and into the house. </p><p>Cyrus could hear his father chuckling at the sight before he left to escort Allison into the festivities. Cyrus continues to wrestle with Jared and the pair end up out on the porch. The two circle as Cyrus struggles to free himself and when Cyrus spins towards the street his gaze catches a confused looking TJ at the bottom of the porch steps. Jared and Cyrus both stop the struggle when they spot the basketball captain although Jared doesn\u2019t release Cyrus from his grip. </p><p>\u201cHey, you made it.\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously in his stepbrothers headlock. \u201cTJ, this is my brother Jared, Jared, this is my friend TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ lets out a quiet chuckle and sends a wave in Jared\u2019s direction. </p><p>Jared gives Cyrus\u2019 hair another ruffle before finally releasing him with an amused smirk as Cyrus scrambles to fix his do.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Jared grins at TJ before turning to Cyrus, \u201cI\u2019m going to go find my dad and say hello.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMeet you in there, jerk.\u201d Cyrus grumbles as he straightens up his outfit. </p><p>\u201cSuddenly I\u2019m glad I\u2019m the older brother in my family.\u201d TJ jokes as he makes his way up the porch steps. </p><p>\u201cJared loves to torment me.\u201d Cyrus says feeling lightly embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your stepbrother, right?\u201d TJ questions.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s Todd\u2019s son from his first marriage.\u201d Cyrus explains. </p><p>\u201cSo does that mean Mason is here too?\u201d TJ asks and Cyrus\u2019 expression curls into one of surprise. </p><p>\u201cYou know Mason?\u201d Cyrus asks, he knew TJ had met his parents before but he didn\u2019t know he had met his stepbrother.</p><p>\u201cAnd Noah, of course.\u201d TJ nods casually but then smiles at Cyrus\u2019 rather adorable look of confusion. \u201cI officially knew one other person at your Bar Mitzvah party and Buffy hated me back then,\u201d TJ chuckles, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t aggravating Buffy I was talking to random people, most of them were your family.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOr when you weren\u2019t helping me open tricky bottles of apple cider.\u201d Cyrus smiles back fondly on the memory. </p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d TJ smiles too. \u201cYour Aunt Ruth- Very chatty by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d Cyrus says to himself more than TJ, \u201cAunt Ruth isn\u2019t here tonight but Mason is, he\u2019s inside playing with Noah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d TJ questions. \u201cIsn\u2019t Noah your dad and Sharon\u2019s son?\u201d TJ knowing this wasn\u2019t as surprising as TJ had officially met Noah before as he had hung out at Cyrus\u2019 fathers house. </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus nods, \u201cThey\u2019re both inside too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, so all four of your parents are here?\u201d TJ looks surprised. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cyrus beams with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019ve come for my favourite night of Hanukkah.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\u2019 family might not put importance into one single night of Hanukkah but this was certainly Cyrus\u2019 favourite one because without fail every year he\u2019d get one night with his divorced parents together and since their new marriages it would be all four of his parents along with his mix of step and half brothers. Now having TJ be apart of it made the night feel extra special for Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Cyrus ushers TJ in with a grin. </p><p>\u201cI like your sweater by the way.\u201d TJ says as he follows Cyrus.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Cyrus grins,\u00a0\u201cLook, I can light the candles-\u201d Cyrus lights the flames of the menorah on his sweater via their reversible sequins. This makes TJ chuckle fondly.\u00a0<br></p><p>Once inside, Cyrus brings TJ to the kitchen where his four parents gathered with Jared and Allison. They each politely greet TJ and make him instantly feel welcomed. </p><p>\u201cThank you for having me here tonight.\u201d TJ smiles at Leslie. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help, just let me know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you dear but you\u2019re fine, you two go off and have some fun.\u201d Leslie\u2019s smile is kind, \u201cDinner shouldn\u2019t be too far off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can hang out in my room.\u201d Cyrus says with a grin but before the two could get past the living room he\u2019s nearly tackled by Mason and Noah. </p><p>TJ gives them both a happy high-five each which visually cements in Cyrus\u2019 mind that TJ had previously interacted with them both prior to tonight. </p><p>\u201cYou said you were coming back to play?\u201d Mason looks hopeful. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Cyrus furrows his brows, \u201cBut TJ and I were going to hang out\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play.\u201d TJ wears a goofy smile, \u201cBut someone\u2019s going to have to teach me the rules.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus turns to give TJ and \u2018are you sure?\u2019 look but he\u2019s already crouching down to sit with the children. Cyrus joins the three and looks at his pile of jellybeans which has seemed to diminish in his absence. </p><p>Cyrus quickly explains to TJ what the dreidel is and what is written on each side.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re letters from the Hebrew alphabet, Nun, Gimel, Hei and Shin. Together they make an acronym, nes gadol haya sham which translates to-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA great miracle happened there.\u201d Mason excitedly finishes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Cyrus smiles at his younger brother.\u00a0\u201cSo you were listening when I taught you how to play?\u201d Cyrus turns back to TJ,\u00a0\u201cThe miracle being-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cA one day supply of oil lasting eight days.\u201d This time is TJ that cuts in proudly with an answer.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus coaxes his head in bewilderment.\u00a0\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know much about Hanukkah?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d TJ admits,\u00a0\u201cBut I did some research last night.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 smile creeps wider.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ just gives Cyrus a small smile before turning his attention to the two youngsters that are patiently waiting to play the game.\u00a0\u201cRight, so how do I play?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I explained what the dreidel really says but Mason and Noah have made up their own meanings.\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cEach side is a colour corresponding with a colour of jellybean\u2026\u201d Cyrus goes on to explain the new game and the four of them get quite competitive as they play. They continue right through until Sharon lets them know that dinner is ready.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d TJ jumps up from his place and makes his way over to the table. \u00a0Cyrus watches TJ with a smile as he approaches the table and he looks to Leslie as if to ask her permission. Leslie picks up on it and tells TJ to sit wherever he likes.</p><p>\u201cI want to sit next to TJ!\u201d Mason comes charging over.</p><p>\u201cNo I want to sit next to TJ!\u201d Noah rushes over too.</p><p>\u201cHey, good thing I have two sides.\u201d TJ shares a goofy grin between the two.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d Cyrus looks over at them with a frown. \u201cWhat if I wanted to sit next to TJ?\u201d</p><p>TJ gives Cyrus an unapologetic shrug.</p><p>You can sit next to me my little cookie pie.\u201d Leslie squeezes Cyrus into a side hug.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mom!</i>\u201d Cyrus groans embarrassed. TJ chuckles softly and with rosy cheeks Cyrus joins his mother at the table, he ends up directly across from TJ with his mother on one side and his father on the other.<br></p><p>Dinner unfolds and the vibe in the room is joyous. The adults quiz Allison and Jared about their college studies, Mason and Noah take up most of TJ\u2019s attention whilst Cyrus sits back and happily watches his family and friend.\u00a0</p><p>Leslie explains a few of the foods to TJ incase they were foreign to him but the basketballer ate everything seemingly without question. Then it\u2019s Cyrus\u2019 father who turns his attention - and subsequently the attention in the room - towards TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, are you and your family planning anything special for the holidays?\u201d Norman asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing special,\u201d TJ grows sheepish, \u201cSort of just waiting for them to be over\u2026\u201d\u00a0TJ\u2019s last statement struck Cyrus as odd and the basketball captain did his best to avoid Cyrus\u2019 quizzical gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a big Christmas fan?\u201d Norman further questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d TJ shrugs in place. </p><p>\u201cAt least the break off school will be nice.\u201d Norman smiles trying to make TJ feel more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s something to look forward to.\u201d TJ smiles. </p><p>\u201cTJ, if you\u2019re not doing anything your family you\u2019re welcome to join us on our ski trip this year.\u201d Leslie says genuinely and Cyrus\u2019 excitement level soared.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ seems surprised.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh course.\u201d Leslie smiles.\u00a0\u201cAndi and Buffy are both coming this year too and Jonah is still waiting for his parents to decide.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ appears to look uncertain as he finds Cyrus\u2019 stare across the table.\u00a0\u201cIt will be so much fun.\u201d Cyrus nods his approval.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSays the lousy skier.\u201d Jared teases from further down the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLeave Cyrus alone.\u201d Todd scolds his oldest son.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure Jared will be more polite during the drive to the lodge.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ thanks both Leslie and Todd for the invite and says he\u2019ll speak to his mother about it when he goes home.\u00a0</p><p>Once everyone is full from dinner - although they each know desserts were still to come - Todd leads the group in lighting the menorahs. The family gather around at the front of the house where a few menorahs were sat on a table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one?\u201d TJ questions quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that one is mine.\u201d Cyrus matches TJ\u2019s soft tone as he points out his one.</p><p>Todd holds the matches and lights each shamash either an adult or child was holding. Everyone starts to say the blessing. TJ had been given a sheet of paper so he could try and follow along, which for the most part he did but the boy looked extremely lost and a little embarrassed by his attempts. During the second blessing Cyrus gives TJ an encouraging smile for his efforts and this seems to put him a little more at ease.\u00a0</p><p>After Cyrus lit the first candle he goes to pass the shamash to TJ who seems panicked.\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d TJ mumbles to Cyrus as if Cyrus\u2019 entire family wasn\u2019t watching them.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus again smiles encouragingly and hands the shamash to TJ, their fingers brushing against each others in the process. Although he was sheepish, TJ rather proudly lights the next candle. The two middle schoolers exchange a warm smile afterwards. The two continue to take turns lighting the next candle on Cyrus\u2019 menorah.</p><p>After the menorah lighting is complete everyone makes their way back towards the living and dining area for a more informal desert.\u00a0</p><p>TJ throughly enjoys a good helping of the\u00a0sufganiyot\u00a0although he has to revert to calling them doughnuts as he butchered the name.\u00a0</p><p>After a night full of family, friends and filling food, Leslie wraps up two extra sufganiyots\u00a0for TJ to take home to his twin siblings.<br></p><p>It\u2019s not until Cyrus is walking TJ out for the night that they finally get a moment alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to light the extra candle now.\u201d TJ steps forward and uses his index finger to\u00a0\u2018light\u2019 the sequins on the next candle of Cyrus\u2019 sweater. This gesture made Cyrus\u2019 skin tickle with goosebumps and he was thankful his Hanukkah sweater concealed them.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee these are going to be given to the twins,\u201d TJ laughs as he holds his wrapped desserts,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re <i>so</i> good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been eating them all week, I\u2019m going to turn into one if I\u2019m not careful.\u201d Cyrus jokes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me tonight.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for coming, sorry my brothers bothered you all night.\u201d Cyrus apologises.<br></p><p>\u201cNo bother at all.\u201d TJ insists,\u00a0\u201cI had a lot of fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou did come for my favourite night.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 smile is small but full of warmth.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause all your parents come together for it?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus nods.\u00a0\u201cEvery year during Hanukkah I bounce around between mom and dads houses. Extended family on both sides come into town or sometimes we\u2019ll go and see them but every year without fail there is one night of Hanukkah where all four of my parents get together and we have a big celebration.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor a divorced couple your parents get along really well.\u201d TJ lightly kicks the ground and something about it felt like TJ had spoken a thought out loud. \u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy dad makes a few digs at Todd here and there but he is only ever joking,\u201d Cyrus lets out a single laugh,\u00a0\u201cMy mom is his best friend.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow often does that happen for split couples?\u201d TJ looks away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d Cyrus acknowledges,\u00a0\u201cMy parents were high school sweethearts and they got married right after college and then had me. I think they both denied it for a while but they weren\u2019t in love anymore - although they constantly assure me I was born out of love -\u201d Cyrus pauses to laugh before continuing,\u00a0\u201cThey split up when I was two but I don\u2019t really remember that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou have a really nice family.\u201d TJ\u2019s smile is soft.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019ll get to spend more time with us on the ski trip - well my mom, Todd and Jared.\u201d Cyrus corrects,\u00a0\u201cMason will be with his mom.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to come to that.\u201d TJ shakes his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut I want you to come,\u201d Cyrus frowns,\u00a0\u201cOnly if you want to come that is..\u201d Cyrus adds quickly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYour mom invited me, you invited your friends.\u201d TJ is shy as they broach the subject,\u00a0\u201cIt kind of feels like a pity invite.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is at all.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 frown deepens at TJ even having the thought,\u00a0\u201cI asked my mom if we could invite you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d TJ seems unsure.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cyrus is genuine,\u00a0\u201cI was going to talk to you about it tonight but my mom beat me to it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cStill.\u201d TJ shrugs a shoulder and Cyrus didn\u2019t like that TJ still didn\u2019t believe him but he decides not to push it much more, instead Cyrus gives TJ some information to take back to his parents.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo mom, Todd and I will be going on the 24th and then Jared who\u2019s spending Christmas with his girlfriend will be driving to the lodge on the 26th. He\u2019s taking Buffy, Andi - and Jonah if he\u2019s allowed - in his car.\u201d Cyrus explains,\u00a0\u201cJared is a pain in the neck but he\u2019s a safe driver. Your parents can talk to my mom and Todd about it if they\u2019re unsure.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u00a0I\u2019ll speak to my mom about it.\u201d TJ nods and a car pulling up interrupts them both, \u201cThat\u2019s my mom, I have to go.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cRemember to ask about the ski trip.\u201d Cyrus adds eagerly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d TJ nods,\u00a0\u201cThanks again for inviting me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watches as TJ disappears down the street in his mothers car. Cyrus can\u2019t help but reflect on TJ\u2019s off mood during that conversation.\u00a0Cyrus\u2019 insecurities would normally lead him to believe that this was because someone like TJ wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with someone like himself but Cyrus knew that wasn\u2019t\u00a0the case, Cyrus believed TJ genuinely didn\u2019t understand that Cyrus <i>really</i> wanted him there.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus remains alone out in the cold December air for a while longer and he finds himself wishing TJ knew how much he meant to him.\u00a0</p><hr><p><b>End notes: </b><i>Day one complete!!!!!!! </i>Firstly I want to say thank you to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZgtMmIBrKcNcCZcLugBtHQ\">@malepresentingleg</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m21CDz26bsh5wb7-nbhHisQ\">@scarybasketballguy</a> for letting me quiz their big beautiful brains about Hanukkah!

Also I will be including almost all of the prompts for the 12 days within this story!\u00a0</p><p>Incase it is unclear the days mentioned are the sixth and seventh night of Hanukkah (the Saturday and second Sunday)</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16968102/chapters/39879168\">Read on ao3</a></p><h2><b>Chapter One:</b> Hanukkah</h2><p><b>Word Count:</b> 3538</p><hr><p>It\u2019s early in the afternoon on a cold Saturday in December. Cyrus is out braving the frosty bite in the air after his mother requested he run to the grocery store to pick up a few last minute things before they go to her parents house for a quiet Hanukkah celebration.</p><p>Cyrus is juggling a grocery bag in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other when he spots TJ further up the street walking in his direction. TJ is lightly bopping along to whatever music is playing in the headphones he wears, his Jackson Street Gym shirt is framed by an unzipped sweatshirt that swings gently as he moves. Cyrus smiles at the sight of TJ even though he hadn\u2019t noticed him in return. As they near each other, TJ looks up to smile at the passerby and realises who it is. </p><p>\u201cCyrus.\u201d TJ sounds pleasantly surprised. He pulls the headphones out and wears a smile that reaches his eyes. </p><p>\u201cFunny running into you here.\u201d Cyrus greets him with a wide grin of his own. </p><p>\u201cOn the corner of Jackson Street, where I work.\u201d TJ says with a smirk, \u201cA real coincidence I\u2019m sure.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not stalking you.\u201d Cyrus jokes with a soft chuckle before giving a playful look as if to say, \u2018or am I?\u2019</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAnd here I was thinking you were lingering outside my work ready to bring me flowers.\u201d TJ jokes as he motions to the bouquet Cyrus holds. TJ\u2019s look of mock offence makes Cyrus laugh further. Once the chuckles tapers off, TJ shifts almost nervously on his feet, \u201cSo,\u201d TJ says with his eyes resting on the bouquet again before flicking his stare back to Cyrus\u2019, \u201cYou got a date or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Cyrus exaggerates a smirk as he nods, \u201cShe\u2019s an older woman. Like seventy years older,\u201d Cyrus cant keep a straight face anymore, \u201cShe\u2019s my grandma.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s expression scrunches at the joke and he shakes his head with a quiet laugh. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus smiles, \u201cWe\u2019re going to see my mom\u2019s parents tonight.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Hanukkah?\u201d TJ questions and Cyrus bops his head even though it was rhetorical. \u201cSo is tonight like the big night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d Cyrus shakes his head, \u201cWe\u2019re just having a quiet night at their house.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo when is the main day?\u201d TJ asks. \u201cI know Hanukkah is eight nights but is it the last one that\u2019s the biggest?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus fights the urge to smile and TJ notices, \u201cOh no, have I said something stupid?\u201d TJ frowns and drops his gaze to his shoes with embarrassment. </p><p>Cyrus wears a kind smile. \u201cLighting the menorah and saying the blessings each night is more or less the same but it\u2019s not like halloween or Christmas where everything builds up to one big celebration. Some families make a bigger deal out of the last night than they do the other seven but for a lot it\u2019s just family time during Hanukkah, some nights might be bigger than others. For me it really just depends on what family we\u2019re seeing on the day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ says and he appears to be genuinely interested in what Cyrus had to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t really know that\u2026 I guess if I\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t really know much about Hanukkah at all.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus was used to people not understanding his traditions as Hanukkah tended to fade into the background as everyone gets into the Christmas spirit. Cyrus was also used to having to explain Hanukkah to different people, he actually kind of liked it because it meant he got to talk about his favourite time of year. Cyrus especially liked getting his friends involved in Hanukkah. </p><p>\u201cWell if you wanted to understand it a little better you\u2019re welcome to come over one night this Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus politely invites TJ. </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ seems surprised, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be like, intruding or something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way. My mom loves when I bring my friends over for Hanukkah.\u201d Cyrus beams. </p><p>\u201cOkay. That sounds really cool.\u201d TJ nods. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow night at my mom\u2019s house?\u201d Cyrus asks. \u201cI mean you can come with me to my grandma\u2019s tonight but she\u2019s a cheek pincher.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u2028TJ rolls his head forward with a chuckle. \u201cTomorrow night.\u201d He nods with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m there.\u201d<br></p><p>- </p><p>The following day, Cyrus is all too happy to dress in the sweater his mom laid out for him to wear whilst indulging in an evening with family. As the night unfolds, Cyrus\u2019 mom\u2019s home fills with faces of people he loves. Cyrus sits on the floor of the living room with his two younger brothers, Mason - Todd\u2019s son from a previous marriage\u00a0and Noah - Sharon and Norman\u2019s son -\u00a0as they teach Cyrus a new game they made up using the dreidel. Cyrus had previously taught them both how to play properly but the young boys found it more interesting to make up their own set of rules and Cyrus was happy to go along with it. </p><p>Although Cyrus was enjoying the quality time with his young siblings, he couldn\u2019t help but repeatedly check his watch as he eagerly awaits the arrival of TJ. The doorbell rings and Cyrus springs up from his position and looks around embarrassed thinking he might have raised suspicion amongst his family members. Although the older adults didn\u2019t seem to be alerted, Cyrus\u2019 two younger brothers looked up at him with pouty faces. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back to play soon.\u201d Cyrus gives them both a crooked smile, \u201cAnd don\u2019t think I wont notice you taking jellybeans from my pile!\u201d Cyrus gives them a playfully stern look each before making his way to the front door where his father, Norman has already answered it.</p><p>\u201cIs it-\u201c Cyrus deflates when he realises it\u2019s his older stepbrother - also from Todd\u2019s previous marriage - and his girlfriend, \u201cOh hi, Jared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGee, Cy, I\u2019m really glad to see you too.\u201d Jared jokes sarcastically before lunging forward and pinning Cyrus in a headlock. </p><p>\u201cThis is exactly why I\u2019m never excited to see you.\u201d Cyrus groans as he tries to wriggle free but Jared\u2019s grip is too strong and Cyrus is subjected to an all too familiar hair ruffle. </p><p>\u201cGive Cy a break.\u201d Allison, Jared\u2019s girlfriend says with a soft giggle as she steps around them and into the house. </p><p>Cyrus could hear his father chuckling at the sight before he left to escort Allison into the festivities. Cyrus continues to wrestle with Jared and the pair end up out on the porch. The two circle as Cyrus struggles to free himself and when Cyrus spins towards the street his gaze catches a confused looking TJ at the bottom of the porch steps. Jared and Cyrus both stop the struggle when they spot the basketball captain although Jared doesn\u2019t release Cyrus from his grip. </p><p>\u201cHey, you made it.\u201d Cyrus laughs nervously in his stepbrothers headlock. \u201cTJ, this is my brother Jared, Jared, this is my friend TJ.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ lets out a quiet chuckle and sends a wave in Jared\u2019s direction. </p><p>Jared gives Cyrus\u2019 hair another ruffle before finally releasing him with an amused smirk as Cyrus scrambles to fix his do.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Jared grins at TJ before turning to Cyrus, \u201cI\u2019m going to go find my dad and say hello.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMeet you in there, jerk.\u201d Cyrus grumbles as he straightens up his outfit. </p><p>\u201cSuddenly I\u2019m glad I\u2019m the older brother in my family.\u201d TJ jokes as he makes his way up the porch steps. </p><p>\u201cJared loves to torment me.\u201d Cyrus says feeling lightly embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your stepbrother, right?\u201d TJ questions.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s Todd\u2019s son from his first marriage.\u201d Cyrus explains. </p><p>\u201cSo does that mean Mason is here too?\u201d TJ asks and Cyrus\u2019 expression curls into one of surprise. </p><p>\u201cYou know Mason?\u201d Cyrus asks, he knew TJ had met his parents before but he didn\u2019t know he had met his stepbrother.</p><p>\u201cAnd Noah, of course.\u201d TJ nods casually but then smiles at Cyrus\u2019 rather adorable look of confusion. \u201cI officially knew one other person at your Bar Mitzvah party and Buffy hated me back then,\u201d TJ chuckles, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t aggravating Buffy I was talking to random people, most of them were your family.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOr when you weren\u2019t helping me open tricky bottles of apple cider.\u201d Cyrus smiles back fondly on the memory. </p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d TJ smiles too. \u201cYour Aunt Ruth- Very chatty by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d Cyrus says to himself more than TJ, \u201cAunt Ruth isn\u2019t here tonight but Mason is, he\u2019s inside playing with Noah.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d TJ questions. \u201cIsn\u2019t Noah your dad and Sharon\u2019s son?\u201d TJ knowing this wasn\u2019t as surprising as TJ had officially met Noah before as he had hung out at Cyrus\u2019 fathers house. </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus nods, \u201cThey\u2019re both inside too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, so all four of your parents are here?\u201d TJ looks surprised. </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cyrus beams with excitement. \u201cYou\u2019ve come for my favourite night of Hanukkah.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus\u2019 family might not put importance into one single night of Hanukkah but this was certainly Cyrus\u2019 favourite one because without fail every year he\u2019d get one night with his divorced parents together and since their new marriages it would be all four of his parents along with his mix of step and half brothers. Now having TJ be apart of it made the night feel extra special for Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Cyrus ushers TJ in with a grin. </p><p>\u201cI like your sweater by the way.\u201d TJ says as he follows Cyrus.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Cyrus grins,\u00a0\u201cLook, I can light the candles-\u201d Cyrus lights the flames of the menorah on his sweater via their reversible sequins. This makes TJ chuckle fondly.\u00a0<br></p><p>Once inside, Cyrus brings TJ to the kitchen where his four parents gathered with Jared and Allison. They each politely greet TJ and make him instantly feel welcomed. </p><p>\u201cThank you for having me here tonight.\u201d TJ smiles at Leslie. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help, just let me know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you dear but you\u2019re fine, you two go off and have some fun.\u201d Leslie\u2019s smile is kind, \u201cDinner shouldn\u2019t be too far off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe can hang out in my room.\u201d Cyrus says with a grin but before the two could get past the living room he\u2019s nearly tackled by Mason and Noah. </p><p>TJ gives them both a happy high-five each which visually cements in Cyrus\u2019 mind that TJ had previously interacted with them both prior to tonight. </p><p>\u201cYou said you were coming back to play?\u201d Mason looks hopeful. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Cyrus furrows his brows, \u201cBut TJ and I were going to hang out\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play.\u201d TJ wears a goofy smile, \u201cBut someone\u2019s going to have to teach me the rules.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus turns to give TJ and \u2018are you sure?\u2019 look but he\u2019s already crouching down to sit with the children. Cyrus joins the three and looks at his pile of jellybeans which has seemed to diminish in his absence. </p><p>Cyrus quickly explains to TJ what the dreidel is and what is written on each side.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re letters from the Hebrew alphabet, Nun, Gimel, Hei and Shin. Together they make an acronym, nes gadol haya sham which translates to-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA great miracle happened there.\u201d Mason excitedly finishes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Cyrus smiles at his younger brother.\u00a0\u201cSo you were listening when I taught you how to play?\u201d Cyrus turns back to TJ,\u00a0\u201cThe miracle being-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cA one day supply of oil lasting eight days.\u201d This time is TJ that cuts in proudly with an answer.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus coaxes his head in bewilderment.\u00a0\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know much about Hanukkah?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d TJ admits,\u00a0\u201cBut I did some research last night.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Cyrus\u2019 smile creeps wider.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ just gives Cyrus a small smile before turning his attention to the two youngsters that are patiently waiting to play the game.\u00a0\u201cRight, so how do I play?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I explained what the dreidel really says but Mason and Noah have made up their own meanings.\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cEach side is a colour corresponding with a colour of jellybean\u2026\u201d Cyrus goes on to explain the new game and the four of them get quite competitive as they play. They continue right through until Sharon lets them know that dinner is ready.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d TJ jumps up from his place and makes his way over to the table. \u00a0Cyrus watches TJ with a smile as he approaches the table and he looks to Leslie as if to ask her permission. Leslie picks up on it and tells TJ to sit wherever he likes.</p><p>\u201cI want to sit next to TJ!\u201d Mason comes charging over.</p><p>\u201cNo I want to sit next to TJ!\u201d Noah rushes over too.</p><p>\u201cHey, good thing I have two sides.\u201d TJ shares a goofy grin between the two.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d Cyrus looks over at them with a frown. \u201cWhat if I wanted to sit next to TJ?\u201d</p><p>TJ gives Cyrus an unapologetic shrug.</p><p>You can sit next to me my little cookie pie.\u201d Leslie squeezes Cyrus into a side hug.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mom!</i>\u201d Cyrus groans embarrassed. TJ chuckles softly and with rosy cheeks Cyrus joins his mother at the table, he ends up directly across from TJ with his mother on one side and his father on the other.<br></p><p>Dinner unfolds and the vibe in the room is joyous. The adults quiz Allison and Jared about their college studies, Mason and Noah take up most of TJ\u2019s attention whilst Cyrus sits back and happily watches his family and friend.\u00a0</p><p>Leslie explains a few of the foods to TJ incase they were foreign to him but the basketballer ate everything seemingly without question. Then it\u2019s Cyrus\u2019 father who turns his attention - and subsequently the attention in the room - towards TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, are you and your family planning anything special for the holidays?\u201d Norman asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing special,\u201d TJ grows sheepish, \u201cSort of just waiting for them to be over\u2026\u201d\u00a0TJ\u2019s last statement struck Cyrus as odd and the basketball captain did his best to avoid Cyrus\u2019 quizzical gaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a big Christmas fan?\u201d Norman further questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d TJ shrugs in place. </p><p>\u201cAt least the break off school will be nice.\u201d Norman smiles trying to make TJ feel more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s something to look forward to.\u201d TJ smiles. </p><p>\u201cTJ, if you\u2019re not doing anything your family you\u2019re welcome to join us on our ski trip this year.\u201d Leslie says genuinely and Cyrus\u2019 excitement level soared.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d TJ seems surprised.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh course.\u201d Leslie smiles.\u00a0\u201cAndi and Buffy are both coming this year too and Jonah is still waiting for his parents to decide.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ appears to look uncertain as he finds Cyrus\u2019 stare across the table.\u00a0\u201cIt will be so much fun.\u201d Cyrus nods his approval.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSays the lousy skier.\u201d Jared teases from further down the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLeave Cyrus alone.\u201d Todd scolds his oldest son.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure Jared will be more polite during the drive to the lodge.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ thanks both Leslie and Todd for the invite and says he\u2019ll speak to his mother about it when he goes home.\u00a0</p><p>Once everyone is full from dinner - although they each know desserts were still to come - Todd leads the group in lighting the menorahs. The family gather around at the front of the house where a few menorahs were sat on a table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one?\u201d TJ questions quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that one is mine.\u201d Cyrus matches TJ\u2019s soft tone as he points out his one.</p><p>Todd holds the matches and lights each shamash either an adult or child was holding. Everyone starts to say the blessing. TJ had been given a sheet of paper so he could try and follow along, which for the most part he did but the boy looked extremely lost and a little embarrassed by his attempts. During the second blessing Cyrus gives TJ an encouraging smile for his efforts and this seems to put him a little more at ease.\u00a0</p><p>After Cyrus lit the first candle he goes to pass the shamash to TJ who seems panicked.\u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d TJ mumbles to Cyrus as if Cyrus\u2019 entire family wasn\u2019t watching them.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus again smiles encouragingly and hands the shamash to TJ, their fingers brushing against each others in the process. Although he was sheepish, TJ rather proudly lights the next candle. The two middle schoolers exchange a warm smile afterwards. The two continue to take turns lighting the next candle on Cyrus\u2019 menorah.</p><p>After the menorah lighting is complete everyone makes their way back towards the living and dining area for a more informal desert.\u00a0</p><p>TJ throughly enjoys a good helping of the\u00a0sufganiyot\u00a0although he has to revert to calling them doughnuts as he butchered the name.\u00a0</p><p>After a night full of family, friends and filling food, Leslie wraps up two extra sufganiyots\u00a0for TJ to take home to his twin siblings.<br></p><p>It\u2019s not until Cyrus is walking TJ out for the night that they finally get a moment alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to light the extra candle now.\u201d TJ steps forward and uses his index finger to\u00a0\u2018light\u2019 the sequins on the next candle of Cyrus\u2019 sweater. This gesture made Cyrus\u2019 skin tickle with goosebumps and he was thankful his Hanukkah sweater concealed them.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee these are going to be given to the twins,\u201d TJ laughs as he holds his wrapped desserts,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re <i>so</i> good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been eating them all week, I\u2019m going to turn into one if I\u2019m not careful.\u201d Cyrus jokes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me tonight.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for coming, sorry my brothers bothered you all night.\u201d Cyrus apologises.<br></p><p>\u201cNo bother at all.\u201d TJ insists,\u00a0\u201cI had a lot of fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou did come for my favourite night.\u201d Cyrus\u2019 smile is small but full of warmth.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause all your parents come together for it?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>Cyrus nods.\u00a0\u201cEvery year during Hanukkah I bounce around between mom and dads houses. Extended family on both sides come into town or sometimes we\u2019ll go and see them but every year without fail there is one night of Hanukkah where all four of my parents get together and we have a big celebration.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor a divorced couple your parents get along really well.\u201d TJ lightly kicks the ground and something about it felt like TJ had spoken a thought out loud. \u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy dad makes a few digs at Todd here and there but he is only ever joking,\u201d Cyrus lets out a single laugh,\u00a0\u201cMy mom is his best friend.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow often does that happen for split couples?\u201d TJ looks away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d Cyrus acknowledges,\u00a0\u201cMy parents were high school sweethearts and they got married right after college and then had me.

Cyrus is out braving the frosty bite in the air after his mother requested he run to the grocery store to pick up a few last minute things before they go to her parents house for a quiet Hanukkah celebration.</p><p>Cyrus is juggling a grocery bag in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other when he spots TJ further up the street walking in his direction. TJ is lightly bopping along to whatever music is playing in the headphones he wears, his Jackson Street Gym shirt is framed by an unzipped sweatshirt that swings gently as he moves. Cyrus smiles at the sight of TJ even though he hadn&rsquo;t noticed him in return. As they near each other, TJ looks up to smile at the passerby and realises who it is. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus.&rdquo; TJ sounds pleasantly surprised. He pulls the headphones out and wears a smile that reaches his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Funny running into you here.&rdquo; Cyrus greets him with a wide grin of his own. </p><p>&ldquo;On the corner of Jackson Street, where I work.&rdquo; TJ says with a smirk, &ldquo;A real coincidence I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not stalking you.&rdquo; Cyrus jokes with a soft chuckle before giving a playful look as if to say, &lsquo;or am I?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And here I was thinking you were lingering outside my work ready to bring me flowers.&rdquo; TJ jokes as he motions to the bouquet Cyrus holds. TJ&rsquo;s look of mock offence makes Cyrus laugh further. Once the chuckles tapers off, TJ shifts almost nervously on his feet, &ldquo;So,&rdquo; TJ says with his eyes resting on the bouquet again before flicking his stare back to Cyrus&rsquo;, &ldquo;You got a date or something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo; Cyrus exaggerates a smirk as he nods, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an older woman. Like seventy years older,&rdquo; Cyrus cant keep a straight face anymore, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my grandma.&rdquo; </p><p>TJ&rsquo;s expression scrunches at the joke and he shakes his head with a quiet laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Hanukkah.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to see my mom&rsquo;s parents tonight.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Hanukkah?&rdquo; TJ questions and Cyrus bops his head even though it was rhetorical. &ldquo;So is tonight like the big night?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, no.&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just having a quiet night at their house.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So when is the main day?&rdquo; TJ asks. &ldquo;I know Hanukkah is eight nights but is it the last one that&rsquo;s the biggest?&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus fights the urge to smile and TJ notices, &ldquo;Oh no, have I said something stupid?&rdquo; TJ frowns and drops his gaze to his shoes with embarrassment. </p><p>Cyrus wears a kind smile. &ldquo;Lighting the menorah and saying the blessings each night is more or less the same but it&rsquo;s not like halloween or Christmas where everything builds up to one big celebration. Some families make a bigger deal out of the last night than they do the other seven but for a lot it&rsquo;s just family time during Hanukkah, some nights might be bigger than others. For me it really just depends on what family we&rsquo;re seeing on the day.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; TJ says and he appears to be genuinely interested in what Cyrus had to say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really know that&hellip; I guess if I&rsquo;m being honest I don&rsquo;t really know much about Hanukkah at all.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus was used to people not understanding his traditions as Hanukkah tended to fade into the background as everyone gets into the Christmas spirit. Cyrus was also used to having to explain Hanukkah to different people, he actually kind of liked it because it meant he got to talk about his favourite time of year. Cyrus especially liked getting his friends involved in Hanukkah. </p><p>&ldquo;Well if you wanted to understand it a little better you&rsquo;re welcome to come over one night this Hanukkah.&rdquo; Cyrus politely invites TJ. </p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; TJ seems surprised, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be like, intruding or something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No way. My mom loves when I bring my friends over for Hanukkah.&rdquo; Cyrus beams. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. That sounds really cool.&rdquo; TJ nods. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How about tomorrow night at my mom&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; Cyrus asks. &ldquo;I mean you can come with me to my grandma&rsquo;s tonight but she&rsquo;s a cheek pincher.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8232;TJ rolls his head forward with a chuckle. &ldquo;Tomorrow night.&rdquo; He nods with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m there.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- </p><p>The following day, Cyrus is all too happy to dress in the sweater his mom laid out for him to wear whilst indulging in an evening with family. As the night unfolds, Cyrus&rsquo; mom&rsquo;s home fills with faces of people he loves. Cyrus sits on the floor of the living room with his two younger brothers, Mason - Todd&rsquo;s son from a previous marriage&nbsp;and Noah - Sharon and Norman&rsquo;s son -&nbsp;as they teach Cyrus a new game they made up using the dreidel. Cyrus had previously taught them both how to play properly but the young boys found it more interesting to make up their own set of rules and Cyrus was happy to go along with it. </p><p>Although Cyrus was enjoying the quality time with his young siblings, he couldn&rsquo;t help but repeatedly check his watch as he eagerly awaits the arrival of TJ. The doorbell rings and Cyrus springs up from his position and looks around embarrassed thinking he might have raised suspicion amongst his family members. Although the older adults didn&rsquo;t seem to be alerted, Cyrus&rsquo; two younger brothers looked up at him with pouty faces. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back to play soon.&rdquo; Cyrus gives them both a crooked smile, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t think I wont notice you taking jellybeans from my pile!&rdquo; Cyrus gives them a playfully stern look each before making his way to the front door where his father, Norman has already answered it.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it-&ldquo; Cyrus deflates when he realises it&rsquo;s his older stepbrother - also from Todd&rsquo;s previous marriage - and his girlfriend, &ldquo;Oh hi, Jared.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Gee, Cy, I&rsquo;m really glad to see you too.&rdquo; Jared jokes sarcastically before lunging forward and pinning Cyrus in a headlock. </p><p>&ldquo;This is exactly why I&rsquo;m never excited to see you.&rdquo; Cyrus groans as he tries to wriggle free but Jared&rsquo;s grip is too strong and Cyrus is subjected to an all too familiar hair ruffle. </p><p>&ldquo;Give Cy a break.&rdquo; Allison, Jared&rsquo;s girlfriend says with a soft giggle as she steps around them and into the house. </p><p>Cyrus could hear his father chuckling at the sight before he left to escort Allison into the festivities. Cyrus continues to wrestle with Jared and the pair end up out on the porch. The two circle as Cyrus struggles to free himself and when Cyrus spins towards the street his gaze catches a confused looking TJ at the bottom of the porch steps. Jared and Cyrus both stop the struggle when they spot the basketball captain although Jared doesn&rsquo;t release Cyrus from his grip. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you made it.&rdquo; Cyrus laughs nervously in his stepbrothers headlock. &ldquo;TJ, this is my brother Jared, Jared, this is my friend TJ.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; TJ lets out a quiet chuckle and sends a wave in Jared&rsquo;s direction. </p><p>Jared gives Cyrus&rsquo; hair another ruffle before finally releasing him with an amused smirk as Cyrus scrambles to fix his do.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you.&rdquo; Jared grins at TJ before turning to Cyrus, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go find my dad and say hello.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Meet you in there, jerk.&rdquo; Cyrus grumbles as he straightens up his outfit. </p><p>&ldquo;Suddenly I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m the older brother in my family.&rdquo; TJ jokes as he makes his way up the porch steps. </p><p>&ldquo;Jared loves to torment me.&rdquo; Cyrus says feeling lightly embarrassed. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your stepbrother, right?&rdquo; TJ questions.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s Todd&rsquo;s son from his first marriage.&rdquo; Cyrus explains. </p><p>&ldquo;So does that mean Mason is here too?&rdquo; TJ asks and Cyrus&rsquo; expression curls into one of surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;You know Mason?&rdquo; Cyrus asks, he knew TJ had met his parents before but he didn&rsquo;t know he had met his stepbrother.</p><p>&ldquo;And Noah, of course.&rdquo; TJ nods casually but then smiles at Cyrus&rsquo; rather adorable look of confusion. &ldquo;I officially knew one other person at your Bar Mitzvah party and Buffy hated me back then,&rdquo; TJ chuckles, &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t aggravating Buffy I was talking to random people, most of them were your family.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Or when you weren&rsquo;t helping me open tricky bottles of apple cider.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles back fondly on the memory. </p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; TJ smiles too. &ldquo;Your Aunt Ruth- Very chatty by the way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo; Cyrus says to himself more than TJ, &ldquo;Aunt Ruth isn&rsquo;t here tonight but Mason is, he&rsquo;s inside playing with Noah.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo; TJ questions. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Noah your dad and Sharon&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; TJ knowing this wasn&rsquo;t as surprising as TJ had officially met Noah before as he had hung out at Cyrus&rsquo; fathers house. </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Cyrus nods, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re both inside too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so all four of your parents are here?&rdquo; TJ looks surprised. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Cyrus beams with excitement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come for my favourite night of Hanukkah.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; family might not put importance into one single night of Hanukkah but this was certainly Cyrus&rsquo; favourite one because without fail every year he&rsquo;d get one night with his divorced parents together and since their new marriages it would be all four of his parents along with his mix of step and half brothers. Now having TJ be apart of it made the night feel extra special for Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;Come inside,&rdquo; Cyrus ushers TJ in with a grin. </p><p>&ldquo;I like your sweater by the way.&rdquo; TJ says as he follows Cyrus.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Cyrus grins,&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, I can light the candles-&rdquo; Cyrus lights the flames of the menorah on his sweater via their reversible sequins. This makes TJ chuckle fondly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Once inside, Cyrus brings TJ to the kitchen where his four parents gathered with Jared and Allison. They each politely greet TJ and make him instantly feel welcomed. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for having me here tonight.&rdquo; TJ smiles at Leslie. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help, just let me know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you dear but you&rsquo;re fine, you two go off and have some fun.&rdquo; Leslie&rsquo;s smile is kind, &ldquo;Dinner shouldn&rsquo;t be too far off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We can hang out in my room.&rdquo; Cyrus says with a grin but before the two could get past the living room he&rsquo;s nearly tackled by Mason and Noah. </p><p>TJ gives them both a happy high-five each which visually cements in Cyrus&rsquo; mind that TJ had previously interacted with them both prior to tonight. </p><p>&ldquo;You said you were coming back to play?&rdquo; Mason looks hopeful. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo; Cyrus furrows his brows, &ldquo;But TJ and I were going to hang out&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play.&rdquo; TJ wears a goofy smile, &ldquo;But someone&rsquo;s going to have to teach me the rules.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus turns to give TJ and &lsquo;are you sure?&rsquo; look but he&rsquo;s already crouching down to sit with the children. Cyrus joins the three and looks at his pile of jellybeans which has seemed to diminish in his absence. </p><p>Cyrus quickly explains to TJ what the dreidel is and what is written on each side.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re letters from the Hebrew alphabet, Nun, Gimel, Hei and Shin. Together they make an acronym, nes gadol haya sham which translates to-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;A great miracle happened there.&rdquo; Mason excitedly finishes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles at his younger brother.&nbsp;&ldquo;So you were listening when I taught you how to play?&rdquo; Cyrus turns back to TJ,&nbsp;&ldquo;The miracle being-&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A one day supply of oil lasting eight days.&rdquo; This time is TJ that cuts in proudly with an answer.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus coaxes his head in bewilderment.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t know much about Hanukkah?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; TJ admits,&nbsp;&ldquo;But I did some research last night.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; smile creeps wider.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ just gives Cyrus a small smile before turning his attention to the two youngsters that are patiently waiting to play the game.&nbsp;&ldquo;Right, so how do I play?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I explained what the dreidel really says but Mason and Noah have made up their own meanings.&rdquo; Cyrus laughs,&nbsp;&ldquo;Each side is a colour corresponding with a colour of jellybean&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus goes on to explain the new game and the four of them get quite competitive as they play. They continue right through until Sharon lets them know that dinner is ready.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo; TJ jumps up from his place and makes his way over to the table. &nbsp;Cyrus watches TJ with a smile as he approaches the table and he looks to Leslie as if to ask her permission. Leslie picks up on it and tells TJ to sit wherever he likes.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to sit next to TJ!&rdquo; Mason comes charging over.</p><p>&ldquo;No I want to sit next to TJ!&rdquo; Noah rushes over too.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, good thing I have two sides.&rdquo; TJ shares a goofy grin between the two.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; Cyrus looks over at them with a frown. &ldquo;What if I wanted to sit next to TJ?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ gives Cyrus an unapologetic shrug.</p><p>You can sit next to me my little cookie pie.&rdquo; Leslie squeezes Cyrus into a side hug.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mom!</i>&rdquo; Cyrus groans embarrassed. TJ chuckles softly and with rosy cheeks Cyrus joins his mother at the table, he ends up directly across from TJ with his mother on one side and his father on the other.<br /></p><p>Dinner unfolds and the vibe in the room is joyous. The adults quiz Allison and Jared about their college studies, Mason and Noah take up most of TJ&rsquo;s attention whilst Cyrus sits back and happily watches his family and friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Leslie explains a few of the foods to TJ incase they were foreign to him but the basketballer ate everything seemingly without question. Then it&rsquo;s Cyrus&rsquo; father who turns his attention - and subsequently the attention in the room - towards TJ.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, are you and your family planning anything special for the holidays?&rdquo; Norman asks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, nothing special,&rdquo; TJ grows sheepish, &ldquo;Sort of just waiting for them to be over&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;TJ&rsquo;s last statement struck Cyrus as odd and the basketball captain did his best to avoid Cyrus&rsquo; quizzical gaze.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a big Christmas fan?&rdquo; Norman further questions.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; TJ shrugs in place. </p><p>&ldquo;At least the break off school will be nice.&rdquo; Norman smiles trying to make TJ feel more comfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s something to look forward to.&rdquo; TJ smiles. </p><p>&ldquo;TJ, if you&rsquo;re not doing anything your family you&rsquo;re welcome to join us on our ski trip this year.&rdquo; Leslie says genuinely and Cyrus&rsquo; excitement level soared.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; TJ seems surprised.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh course.&rdquo; Leslie smiles.&nbsp;&ldquo;Andi and Buffy are both coming this year too and Jonah is still waiting for his parents to decide.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ appears to look uncertain as he finds Cyrus&rsquo; stare across the table.&nbsp;&ldquo;It will be so much fun.&rdquo; Cyrus nods his approval.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Says the lousy skier.&rdquo; Jared teases from further down the table.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Leave Cyrus alone.&rdquo; Todd scolds his oldest son.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Jared will be more polite during the drive to the lodge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ thanks both Leslie and Todd for the invite and says he&rsquo;ll speak to his mother about it when he goes home.&nbsp;</p><p>Once everyone is full from dinner - although they each know desserts were still to come - Todd leads the group in lighting the menorahs. The family gather around at the front of the house where a few menorahs were sat on a table.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one?&rdquo; TJ questions quietly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that one is mine.&rdquo; Cyrus matches TJ&rsquo;s soft tone as he points out his one.</p><p>Todd holds the matches and lights each shamash either an adult or child was holding. Everyone starts to say the blessing. TJ had been given a sheet of paper so he could try and follow along, which for the most part he did but the boy looked extremely lost and a little embarrassed by his attempts. During the second blessing Cyrus gives TJ an encouraging smile for his efforts and this seems to put him a little more at ease.&nbsp;</p><p>After Cyrus lit the first candle he goes to pass the shamash to TJ who seems panicked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; TJ mumbles to Cyrus as if Cyrus&rsquo; entire family wasn&rsquo;t watching them.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus again smiles encouragingly and hands the shamash to TJ, their fingers brushing against each others in the process. Although he was sheepish, TJ rather proudly lights the next candle. The two middle schoolers exchange a warm smile afterwards. The two continue to take turns lighting the next candle on Cyrus&rsquo; menorah.</p><p>After the menorah lighting is complete everyone makes their way back towards the living and dining area for a more informal desert.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ throughly enjoys a good helping of the&nbsp;sufganiyot&nbsp;although he has to revert to calling them doughnuts as he butchered the name.&nbsp;</p><p>After a night full of family, friends and filling food, Leslie wraps up two extra sufganiyots&nbsp;for TJ to take home to his twin siblings.<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s not until Cyrus is walking TJ out for the night that they finally get a moment alone.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to light the extra candle now.&rdquo; TJ steps forward and uses his index finger to&nbsp;&lsquo;light&rsquo; the sequins on the next candle of Cyrus&rsquo; sweater. This gesture made Cyrus&rsquo; skin tickle with goosebumps and he was thankful his Hanukkah sweater concealed them.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guarantee these are going to be given to the twins,&rdquo; TJ laughs as he holds his wrapped desserts,&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re <i>so</i> good.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been eating them all week, I&rsquo;m going to turn into one if I&rsquo;m not careful.&rdquo; Cyrus jokes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for inviting me tonight.&rdquo; TJ says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for coming, sorry my brothers bothered you all night.&rdquo; Cyrus apologises.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No bother at all.&rdquo; TJ insists,&nbsp;&ldquo;I had a lot of fun.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You did come for my favourite night.&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; smile is small but full of warmth.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because all your parents come together for it?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Cyrus nods.&nbsp;&ldquo;Every year during Hanukkah I bounce around between mom and dads houses. Extended family on both sides come into town or sometimes we&rsquo;ll go and see them but every year without fail there is one night of Hanukkah where all four of my parents get together and we have a big celebration.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;For a divorced couple your parents get along really well.&rdquo; TJ lightly kicks the ground and something about it felt like TJ had spoken a thought out loud. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My dad makes a few digs at Todd here and there but he is only ever joking,&rdquo; Cyrus lets out a single laugh,&nbsp;&ldquo;My mom is his best friend.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How often does that happen for split couples?&rdquo; TJ looks away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m really lucky.&rdquo; Cyrus acknowledges,&nbsp;&ldquo;My parents were high school sweethearts and they got married right after college and then had me. I think they both denied it for a while but they weren&rsquo;t in love anymore - although they constantly assure me I was born out of love -&rdquo; Cyrus pauses to laugh before continuing,&nbsp;&ldquo;They split up when I was two but I don&rsquo;t really remember that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You have a really nice family.&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s smile is soft.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;ll get to spend more time with us on the ski trip - well my mom, Todd and Jared.&rdquo; Cyrus corrects,&nbsp;&ldquo;Mason will be with his mom.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to come to that.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But I want you to come,&rdquo; Cyrus frowns,&nbsp;&ldquo;Only if you want to come that is..&rdquo; Cyrus adds quickly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your mom invited me, you invited your friends.&rdquo; TJ is shy as they broach the subject,&nbsp;&ldquo;It kind of feels like a pity invite.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what this is at all.&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo; frown deepens at TJ even having the thought,&nbsp;&ldquo;I asked my mom if we could invite you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; TJ seems unsure.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Cyrus is genuine,&nbsp;&ldquo;I was going to talk to you about it tonight but my mom beat me to it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Still.&rdquo; TJ shrugs a shoulder and Cyrus didn&rsquo;t like that TJ still didn&rsquo;t believe him but he decides not to push it much more, instead Cyrus gives TJ some information to take back to his parents.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So mom, Todd and I will be going on the 24th and then Jared who&rsquo;s spending Christmas with his girlfriend will be driving to the lodge on the 26th. He&rsquo;s taking Buffy, Andi - and Jonah if he&rsquo;s allowed - in his car.&rdquo; Cyrus explains,&nbsp;&ldquo;Jared is a pain in the neck but he&rsquo;s a safe driver. Your parents can talk to my mom and Todd about it if they&rsquo;re unsure.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll speak to my mom about it.&rdquo; TJ nods and a car pulling up interrupts them both, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my mom, I have to go.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember to ask about the ski trip.&rdquo; Cyrus adds eagerly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; TJ nods,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks again for inviting me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus watches as TJ disappears down the street in his mothers car. Cyrus can&rsquo;t help but reflect on TJ&rsquo;s off mood during that conversation.&nbsp;Cyrus&rsquo; insecurities would normally lead him to believe that this was because someone like TJ wouldn&rsquo;t want to hang out with someone like himself but Cyrus knew that wasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;the case, Cyrus believed TJ genuinely didn&rsquo;t understand that Cyrus <i>really</i> wanted him there.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus remains alone out in the cold December air for a while longer and he finds himself wishing TJ knew how much he meant to him.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><b>End notes: </b><i>Day one complete!!!!!!! </i>Firstly I want to say thank you to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZgtMmIBrKcNcCZcLugBtHQ\">@malepresentingleg</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m21CDz26bsh5wb7-nbhHisQ\">@scarybasketballguy</a> for letting me quiz their big beautiful brains about Hanukkah!

Cyrus is out braving the frosty bite in the air after his mother requested he run to the grocery store to pick up a few last minute things before they go to her parents house for a quiet Hanukkah celebration.</p>\n<p>Cyrus is juggling a grocery bag in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other when he spots TJ further up the street walking in his direction. TJ is lightly bopping along to whatever music is playing in the headphones he wears, his Jackson Street Gym shirt is framed by an unzipped sweatshirt that swings gently as he moves. Cyrus smiles at the sight of TJ even though he hadn&rsquo;t noticed him in return. As they near each other, TJ looks up to smile at the passerby and realises who it is. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cyrus.&rdquo; TJ sounds pleasantly surprised. He pulls the headphones out and wears a smile that reaches his eyes. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Funny running into you here.&rdquo; Cyrus greets him with a wide grin of his own. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;On the corner of Jackson Street, where I work.&rdquo; TJ says with a smirk, &ldquo;A real coincidence I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not stalking you.&rdquo; Cyrus jokes with a soft chuckle before giving a playful look as if to say, &lsquo;or am I?&rsquo;</p>\n</p>",

As I&rsquo;m rewatching seasons 1 &amp; 2, its becoming increasingly clear how much of this show was mapped out from the very beginning. Obviously some things have changed due to Disney censorship (Tyrus) or circumstance (Marty leaving for awhile)&hellip; but overall, when you watch all of the episodes together the story makes sense and starts to feel more complete. It also seems pretty clear that Terri and the cast are prepared for this to be the final season, which is going to show in the final episodes. And that&rsquo;s a really good thing. Telling a complete story and wrapping it up on your terms is such a rare thing in television, and I would much rather the show end like that than watch it be rushed or burn out like what happened with GMW.</p><p>All of that being said, while I am logically prepared for the end of Andi Mack, I don&rsquo;t think I will ever be emotionally prepared for it. I&rsquo;m going to miss the characters and the cast being together and all of the potential the show had, sure. But it really makes me sad because I know young people need shows like this, and Disney doesn&rsquo;t have much going for it other than The A Girl which hasn&rsquo;t even been officially picked up yet as far as I know. (Side note: I&rsquo;m super stoked for that show but given the fact that the lead actress is 17 and also openly bisexual I&rsquo;m p sure, I don&rsquo;t see Disney allowing that show to go on for a super long time). Anyways. I just miss the days when Disney Channel shows went on longer.
