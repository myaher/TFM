Anyway, here\u2019s a little piece I wrote from a request I got. I kinda changed it up a little bit. Hope you enjoy! Don\u2019t forget that you can request anything that you\u2019d like to see from me!<i> <a href=\"http://www.stylishxrry.tumblr.com/ask\">Send them here!</a></i></p><hr><p>You were stood outside of the party holding your coat tight around your waist to try and keep yourself warm. Tears stained your cheeks as you waited for your Uber to come and pick you up. Suddenly, lightning lit up the night sky and it started to rain. What a perfect way to end a bad night. You were standing alone, upset, cold and, wet and just wanted to go to bed. What happened you asked? It all began two weeks ago when <i>he\u00a0</i>met <i>her</i>. </p><!-- more --><p><b>TWO WEEKS AGO </b></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Y/N and Harry had been best friends since they were 14. They were paired together for a group assignment during school and ever since then they were inseparable. Even now with Harry being a major celebrity and you being a fashion stylist with a hectic schedule you both still managed to find time to fit each other in. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One Wednesday morning you had met Harry for brunch in the city. You ordered your usual \u2013 pancakes with ice cream and strawberries with maple syrup on the side. Harry always teased you about this because even though you are in your mid-twenties you still ordered off of the children\u2019s menu at your regular caf\u00e9. You were organising with Harry when the both of you were available next to hang out with each other again when all of a sudden someone bumped into your table and spilled Harry\u2019s iced coffee off of the table and onto his lap. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh my gosh! I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 let me replace that for you! I can\u2019t believe that happened\u201d The beautiful blonde, tall woman said apologetically, frantically reaching for the napkins on the other table to hand to Harry so he could clean up. Harry politely declined her offer to replace his drink and instead told her that he would buy her a drink over dinner. He was always very confident with women. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harry and Annabelle went on their dinner date and you heard all about the events of the date later that night. They were going on a second date. And soon enough, Annabelle was all that Harry could seem to talk to you about. She began tagging along to your brunches with Harry and was getting overly clingy of him. Surely enough she was beginning to get jealous of how close he was to you. She thought she had competition and needed to get rid of you somehow. </i></p><p><b>PRESENT DAY</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were attending an after party that Harry had invited you to weeks ago. You were wearing a beautiful red dress that suited your figure perfectly. \u201cWow, Y/N you look stunning\u201d Harry said, handing you a glass of champagne. \u201cThanks H\u201d, you smiled taking a sip of your drink. Before you could ask where she was, Annabelle came up behind Harry and kissed his cheek. She was being overly affectionate in front of you. \u201cHarry, I need to talk to you about something, can we go out the back for a second?\u201d She said sweetly, pulling him away by his hand. You went and found a seat beside some other celebrities and were discussing their outfits with them when Harry came back with a sad look on his face. \u201cH, are you alright?\u201d You ask, standing up and following him to a quiet room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N, I really like Annabelle. You know that right?\u201d He said softly, his eyes glued to the floor, fiddling with the sleeves of his suit coat. You nodded setting your empty glass aside on the table behind you. \u201cWell, she feels like you might have feelings for me and has told me that either you go or she does\u201d He mumbled, barely audible. \u201cExcuse me, what did you say? Did you say that she asked you to pick me or her?\u201d You question, shocked she would do this. \u201cH, please tell me that you told her she\u2019s crazy.\u201d You say, grabbing a waiter and getting another glass of champagne to get you through this conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not crazy. Do you? Do you have feelings for me?\u201d He asked you finally picking up the confidence to look at you. \u201cHarry, I\u2019ve known you since I was 14. You\u2019re honestly like a brother to me. It would be weird. I can\u2019t believe that she said that to you. Who does she think she is?\u201d You say, the room grew colder all of a sudden as you shoved your romantic feelings for Harry aside. Harry did not like you talking about Annabelle like that. \u201cDo you have a problem with her? She has done nothing wrong to you. She was just insecure about where you stand. I thought you would be happy that I might have found someone.\u201d Harry snaps out of nowhere. \u201cWoah, I think you need to calm down a bit there Harry. I just think that she\u2019s moving really quickly and you barely know each other, I\u2019m just looking out for you\u201d You say, reaching out to comfort him. He shrugged his shoulder away from your reach. \u201cNo. Maybe she\u2019s right. You don\u2019t know how well we know each other. You\u2019ve always judged her from day one. I don\u2019t need that negativity and judgement in my life. I\u2019m sorry Y/N. I can\u2019t do this anymore if you\u2019re going to continue acting this way towards Annabelle\u201d He said harshly. You were taken back by his words, your heart broke at the realisation that he had chosen her over you. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, bye Y/N\u201d He said, walking out of the room leaving you alone and crying. </p><p>You were stood outside of the party holding your coat tight around your waist to try and keep yourself warm. Tears stained your cheeks as you waited for your Uber to come and pick you up. Suddenly, lightning lit up the night sky and it started to rain. What a perfect way to end a bad night. You were standing alone, upset, cold and, wet and just wanted to go to bed. Your Uber driver pulled up and you got in the car not speaking a word and got driven home. Once you were home you took all of your makeup off, put your pyjamas on and got straight into bed. </p><p><b>FOUR MONTHS LATER</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It had been four months without hearing a word from Harry. You still visited your regular brunch spot every week ordering pancakes with ice cream and strawberries and maple syrup on the side. \u201cStill ordering off of the kids menu, huh?\u201d A familiar voice said standing behind your shoulder. You turned around to see Harry standing behind you in an oversized hoodie and his usual black skinny jeans. \u201cWon\u2019t Annabelle be upset with you that you\u2019re talking to me?\u201d You mumbled, turning back around and pushing a strawberry around the plate with your fork. Harry sat himself down at your table. \u201cY/N, these past four months have been hell. Annabelle and I broke up. She was using me to help her gain a media presence.

And even though you said you only see me as a brother figure, I think I might be in love with you. And I understand if you hate me for choosing her over you. But Y/N, you make me the happiest guy in the world. I\u2019d really like it if you would let me back into your life.\u201d He said reaching out to grab your spare hand over the table.

They were paired together for a group assignment during school and ever since then they were inseparable. Even now with Harry being a major celebrity and you being a fashion stylist with a hectic schedule you both still managed to find time to fit each other in. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One Wednesday morning you had met Harry for brunch in the city. You ordered your usual \u2013 pancakes with ice cream and strawberries with maple syrup on the side. Harry always teased you about this because even though you are in your mid-twenties you still ordered off of the children\u2019s menu at your regular caf\u00e9. You were organising with Harry when the both of you were available next to hang out with each other again when all of a sudden someone bumped into your table and spilled Harry\u2019s iced coffee off of the table and onto his lap. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh my gosh! I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 let me replace that for you! I can\u2019t believe that happened\u201d The beautiful blonde, tall woman said apologetically, frantically reaching for the napkins on the other table to hand to Harry so he could clean up. Harry politely declined her offer to replace his drink and instead told her that he would buy her a drink over dinner. He was always very confident with women. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Harry and Annabelle went on their dinner date and you heard all about the events of the date later that night. They were going on a second date. And soon enough, Annabelle was all that Harry could seem to talk to you about. She began tagging along to your brunches with Harry and was getting overly clingy of him. Surely enough she was beginning to get jealous of how close he was to you. She thought she had competition and needed to get rid of you somehow. </i></p><p><b>PRESENT DAY</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were attending an after party that Harry had invited you to weeks ago. You were wearing a beautiful red dress that suited your figure perfectly. \u201cWow, Y/N you look stunning\u201d Harry said, handing you a glass of champagne. \u201cThanks H\u201d, you smiled taking a sip of your drink. Before you could ask where she was, Annabelle came up behind Harry and kissed his cheek. She was being overly affectionate in front of you. \u201cHarry, I need to talk to you about something, can we go out the back for a second?\u201d She said sweetly, pulling him away by his hand. You went and found a seat beside some other celebrities and were discussing their outfits with them when Harry came back with a sad look on his face. \u201cH, are you alright?\u201d You ask, standing up and following him to a quiet room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N, I really like Annabelle. You know that right?\u201d He said softly, his eyes glued to the floor, fiddling with the sleeves of his suit coat. You nodded setting your empty glass aside on the table behind you. \u201cWell, she feels like you might have feelings for me and has told me that either you go or she does\u201d He mumbled, barely audible. \u201cExcuse me, what did you say? Did you say that she asked you to pick me or her?\u201d You question, shocked she would do this. \u201cH, please tell me that you told her she\u2019s crazy.\u201d You say, grabbing a waiter and getting another glass of champagne to get you through this conversation. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not crazy. Do you? Do you have feelings for me?\u201d He asked you finally picking up the confidence to look at you. \u201cHarry, I\u2019ve known you since I was 14. You\u2019re honestly like a brother to me. It would be weird. I can\u2019t believe that she said that to you. Who does she think she is?\u201d You say, the room grew colder all of a sudden as you shoved your romantic feelings for Harry aside. Harry did not like you talking about Annabelle like that. \u201cDo you have a problem with her? She has done nothing wrong to you. She was just insecure about where you stand. I thought you would be happy that I might have found someone.\u201d Harry snaps out of nowhere. \u201cWoah, I think you need to calm down a bit there Harry. I just think that she\u2019s moving really quickly and you barely know each other, I\u2019m just looking out for you\u201d You say, reaching out to comfort him. He shrugged his shoulder away from your reach. \u201cNo. Maybe she\u2019s right. You don\u2019t know how well we know each other. You\u2019ve always judged her from day one. I don\u2019t need that negativity and judgement in my life. I\u2019m sorry Y/N. I can\u2019t do this anymore if you\u2019re going to continue acting this way towards Annabelle\u201d He said harshly. You were taken back by his words, your heart broke at the realisation that he had chosen her over you. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, bye Y/N\u201d He said, walking out of the room leaving you alone and crying. </p><p>You were stood outside of the party holding your coat tight around your waist to try and keep yourself warm. Tears stained your cheeks as you waited for your Uber to come and pick you up. Suddenly, lightning lit up the night sky and it started to rain. What a perfect way to end a bad night. You were standing alone, upset, cold and, wet and just wanted to go to bed. Your Uber driver pulled up and you got in the car not speaking a word and got driven home. Once you were home you took all of your makeup off, put your pyjamas on and got straight into bed. </p><p><b>FOUR MONTHS LATER</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It had been four months without hearing a word from Harry. You still visited your regular brunch spot every week ordering pancakes with ice cream and strawberries and maple syrup on the side. \u201cStill ordering off of the kids menu, huh?\u201d A familiar voice said standing behind your shoulder. You turned around to see Harry standing behind you in an oversized hoodie and his usual black skinny jeans. \u201cWon\u2019t Annabelle be upset with you that you\u2019re talking to me?\u201d You mumbled, turning back around and pushing a strawberry around the plate with your fork. Harry sat himself down at your table. \u201cY/N, these past four months have been hell. Annabelle and I broke up. She was using me to help her gain a media presence. I should have listened to you when you were looking out for me.\u201d He said, moving the sugar and menu onto the empty table beside you so he could rest his elbows on the table. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI also realised something while I was being an absolute asshole to you.\u201d He said, stealing a strawberry off of your plate. \u201cHey!\u201d You said, looking up at him and his signature cheeky grin. \u201cI realised that you make me incredibly happy.

I&rsquo;m so sorry &ndash; let me replace that for you! I can&rsquo;t believe that happened&rdquo; The beautiful blonde, tall woman said apologetically, frantically reaching for the napkins on the other table to hand to Harry so he could clean up. Harry politely declined her offer to replace his drink and instead told her that he would buy her a drink over dinner. He was always very confident with women. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Harry and Annabelle went on their dinner date and you heard all about the events of the date later that night. They were going on a second date. And soon enough, Annabelle was all that Harry could seem to talk to you about. She began tagging along to your brunches with Harry and was getting overly clingy of him. Surely enough she was beginning to get jealous of how close he was to you. She thought she had competition and needed to get rid of you somehow. </i></p><p><b>PRESENT DAY</b></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You were attending an after party that Harry had invited you to weeks ago. You were wearing a beautiful red dress that suited your figure perfectly. &ldquo;Wow, Y/N you look stunning&rdquo; Harry said, handing you a glass of champagne. &ldquo;Thanks H&rdquo;, you smiled taking a sip of your drink. Before you could ask where she was, Annabelle came up behind Harry and kissed his cheek. She was being overly affectionate in front of you. &ldquo;Harry, I need to talk to you about something, can we go out the back for a second?&rdquo; She said sweetly, pulling him away by his hand. You went and found a seat beside some other celebrities and were discussing their outfits with them when Harry came back with a sad look on his face. &ldquo;H, are you alright?&rdquo; You ask, standing up and following him to a quiet room. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N, I really like Annabelle. You know that right?&rdquo; He said softly, his eyes glued to the floor, fiddling with the sleeves of his suit coat. You nodded setting your empty glass aside on the table behind you. &ldquo;Well, she feels like you might have feelings for me and has told me that either you go or she does&rdquo; He mumbled, barely audible. &ldquo;Excuse me, what did you say? Did you say that she asked you to pick me or her?&rdquo; You question, shocked she would do this. &ldquo;H, please tell me that you told her she&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo; You say, grabbing a waiter and getting another glass of champagne to get you through this conversation. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not crazy. Do you? Do you have feelings for me?&rdquo; He asked you finally picking up the confidence to look at you. &ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;ve known you since I was 14. You&rsquo;re honestly like a brother to me. It would be weird. I can&rsquo;t believe that she said that to you. Who does she think she is?&rdquo; You say, the room grew colder all of a sudden as you shoved your romantic feelings for Harry aside. Harry did not like you talking about Annabelle like that. &ldquo;Do you have a problem with her? She has done nothing wrong to you. She was just insecure about where you stand. I thought you would be happy that I might have found someone.&rdquo; Harry snaps out of nowhere. &ldquo;Woah, I think you need to calm down a bit there Harry. I just think that she&rsquo;s moving really quickly and you barely know each other, I&rsquo;m just looking out for you&rdquo; You say, reaching out to comfort him. He shrugged his shoulder away from your reach. &ldquo;No. Maybe she&rsquo;s right. You don&rsquo;t know how well we know each other. You&rsquo;ve always judged her from day one. I don&rsquo;t need that negativity and judgement in my life. I&rsquo;m sorry Y/N. I can&rsquo;t do this anymore if you&rsquo;re going to continue acting this way towards Annabelle&rdquo; He said harshly. You were taken back by his words, your heart broke at the realisation that he had chosen her over you. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this, bye Y/N&rdquo; He said, walking out of the room leaving you alone and crying. </p><p>You were stood outside of the party holding your coat tight around your waist to try and keep yourself warm. Tears stained your cheeks as you waited for your Uber to come and pick you up. Suddenly, lightning lit up the night sky and it started to rain. What a perfect way to end a bad night. You were standing alone, upset, cold and, wet and just wanted to go to bed. Your Uber driver pulled up and you got in the car not speaking a word and got driven home. Once you were home you took all of your makeup off, put your pyjamas on and got straight into bed. </p><p><b>FOUR MONTHS LATER</b></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been four months without hearing a word from Harry. You still visited your regular brunch spot every week ordering pancakes with ice cream and strawberries and maple syrup on the side. &ldquo;Still ordering off of the kids menu, huh?&rdquo; A familiar voice said standing behind your shoulder. You turned around to see Harry standing behind you in an oversized hoodie and his usual black skinny jeans. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Annabelle be upset with you that you&rsquo;re talking to me?&rdquo; You mumbled, turning back around and pushing a strawberry around the plate with your fork. Harry sat himself down at your table. &ldquo;Y/N, these past four months have been hell. Annabelle and I broke up. She was using me to help her gain a media presence. I should have listened to you when you were looking out for me.&rdquo; He said, moving the sugar and menu onto the empty table beside you so he could rest his elbows on the table. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I also realised something while I was being an absolute asshole to you.&rdquo; He said, stealing a strawberry off of your plate. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; You said, looking up at him and his signature cheeky grin. &ldquo;I realised that you make me incredibly happy. And even though you said you only see me as a brother figure, I think I might be in love with you. And I understand if you hate me for choosing her over you. But Y/N, you make me the happiest guy in the world. I&rsquo;d really like it if you would let me back into your life.&rdquo; He said reaching out to grab your spare hand over the table. You blush, looking back down at your plate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re on the same page now. But you owe me some strawberries&rdquo; you say, looking up at him, intertwining your fingers with him. &ldquo;So, is that a yes? We&rsquo;re friends again?&rdquo; He asked, chuckling at your comment. You nodded, taking a sip of your coffee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d also really like it if I could take you on a proper date.&rdquo; He said looking into your eyes. It was in that moment that you noticed how he looked at you with such adoration and love. You knew that saying yes to his question was going to be the best decision you ever made. </p>",

        "body": "<p><b>I think I have done a terrible job. But, I wrote after so long, I\u2019m happy.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>Concept: Rich Y/N has to shift into a small studio with her sister, bringing a complete change from their high society lifestyle. The owner of the studio right in front of them, Harry isn\u2019t too pleased with this move.\u00a0</b></p><p>Warnings: Weed, will have smut later.\u00a0</p><p><b>3.5K+</b></p><p><b>&mdash;</b></p><p>This was the best they could do. The best they could do for me at the moment. Was it a downfall? A shattering one. Maybe shattering doesn\u2019t justify it. I didn\u2019t expect much from our relatives otherwise either.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cDo we have to stay here?\u201d My sister asked, looking at our tiny studio apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling,\u201d I said, pushing our boxes inside. We sold most of our stuff, including my parent&rsquo;s house which the bank took as collateral. If I wanted my sister to continue going to the private school, which would ensure her future, we had to make that sacrifice. We had limited funds, and thankfully my university was paid for and we had our scholarships, but our way of life, our expenses - everything took a huge hit. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can do something amazing with it!\u201d Decorate it like we always wanted to, but Mum never allowed us because of white walls?\u201d I tried to cheer her up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go against her now,\u201d She sighed, sitting on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAlright! You know what? Why don\u2019t you make me us some pancakes, and I\u2019ll get all the boxes inside, and we can then unpack?\u201d She nodded, always love the idea of cooking. I hope I could send her to the best school one day, but she was only 13, and I had time to worry about that.</p><p>I walked out, looking at the dingy corridor filled with my stuff, and a door on the opposite side. Should probably say Hi to my new neighbour - maybe bake some cookies as an exchange? Wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>I tried being strong in the entire process. Losing our home, our wealth, our everything took a strong hit, with our personal relationships as well. My boyfriend broke up with me, my friends who I used to hang out with me stopped texting when I shifted homes. They all knew about the loss of income, and my world had always been shallow. I had a list of things to mourn about and absolutely no time at the moment. \u00a0</p><p>Setting up the tiny studio was hard, but we managed to fit our stuff. I was proud of how well my sister was taking it, knowing how difficult it must be for her. \u201cExcited to go to school tomorrow? The bus, I found out, actually comes right down the lane, so it\u2019s not much walking-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do people care about money so much? How does it matter if we don\u2019t have it more of it, anymore? We have enough to still go to school. I am still me, then why are kids so shallow,\u201d My sister asked, and I felt like she had aged so much in the last month.</p><p>\u201cPeople are always shallow. You know how Mum made fun of all of Dad\u2019s friends? She got it as well! Remember that friends who leave you in your time of need, are not friends, to begin with, and you should always strive for true friendship. Always be kind, and hardworking and keep your head up high. We don\u2019t need anything else!\u201d She hugged me tightly, crying into my chest. I hope things aren\u2019t as hard for her.</p><p>If missing three weeks of University was bad, having your group of friends ignore you, while you tried to settle in was worse. Obviously, I didn\u2019t come in my Porsche, obviously, I took the train, and obviously, I went to the student cafe for lunch and not the restaurant like my old routine. Everyone knew what happened, what was there to gossip about?</p><p>Max, my ex-boyfriend came and sat beside me during the gap in my schedule. I stayed away, feeling the negativity and toxic air that I didn\u2019t want to interact. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say hi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you noticed people who didn\u2019t have the heritage money in the bank,\u201d I closed my book.</p><p>\u201cLook-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t deal with this, Max. You said enough at Cheryl\u2019s party, and I didn\u2019t realize how pathetic we were. I need to widen my horizon, find my people who don\u2019t make friends with bank accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d He argued.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you just laughed with Catherine and Misha. Same thing! And, you broke up with me. Two weeks after my parents- you should go!\u201d I stood up.</p><p>\u201cMy mother made me do that! You know how important standing is, you were a part of it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am still a part of it. I still have all my standing, all my recommendations in place because I didn\u2019t buy them as you did. I am better than you, all of you. I didn\u2019t love you for how much you could spend,\u201d Walking away from him, felt good. I didn\u2019t have the time to wallow.</p><p>I was still on top of my class. My professors expected write-ups but, I was on schedule to graduate by the end of the year. During lunch, my two friends who I honestly loved the most, and were secretly still there for me, came and sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThis place has amazing Mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese if you have to know! And, it\u2019s my cheat day!\u201d Kyle rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it!\u201d Meera hit him, hugging me tightly. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t tolerate Catherine without your sarcastic remarks! It was intolerable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you!\u201d Kyle took a bite of his cheat day dish. \u201cI expected you to take your place back, and you didn\u2019t even come and say hi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted you though,\u201d I blew him a kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Meera said, taking my hands, \u201cI never liked that group thing. Let\u2019s not do it again!\u201d I was glad that at least at least I was a person who had made tight, genuine bonds.</p><p>The train ride home was long. It took me 20 minutes with my car to reach home, but I didn\u2019t live in the central city anymore. I just had to get used to it. Distract myself, observe things in this 65-minute ride back home. A guy sat down in front of me after the old lady got off at her stop. His head was in his phone, earphones in, with his hoody on, and I had a feeling that he was in my class this afternoon. I didn\u2019t notice him, but he had his back to me when I saw him walk out of class, and I didn\u2019t know him. I tried for a while, wanting to make an eye-contact. Maybe he knew me? People knew me, in general. He got off at the same stop as me, and we walked the same way back home. I didn\u2019t have the guts to say Hi.</p><p>I stopped on my way to the grocery store. My sister told me about her day, and how her best friend was still her best friend, and I felt it might be alright for us here. We baked cookies for our neighbour, and I rang on the doorbell. The same guy in the train, from my class today opened the door, and the only way I could be sure was because it was the same hoody and the same body structure. I gave him my big smile, always worked with all the people, \u201cHi! My sister and I just moved in, and we baked you some cookies and introduce ourselves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are Y/N Y/L/N. What are you doing here?\u201d He said, shocked.</p><p>\u201cYou know me! I wanted to say Hi while we were on our way back but, didn\u2019t get the chance to do that!\u201d he frowned, looking a little pissed, and I wondered if I did something wrong. \u201cThis is my sister, Sara!\u201d I pulled her forward to ease the tension. He smiled at her, and I could see his dimples and my sister gave him the cookies.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sara! I\u2019m Harry\u201d He nodded. \u201cLet me know if you need anything.\u201d He said, talking to her and then closed the door on my face before I could speak.</p><p>\u201cDid you do something to him?\u201d My sister asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him!\u201d I said, turning to our door.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to like you,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t even know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is really handsome, though!\u201d She elbowed me.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The mystery grew further when Harry categorically avoided me for the next few weeks. Life wasn\u2019t exactly getting easy with asking my sister to control her expenses, and her crying, and trying to make food every day on top of managing a child, and then keeping in check with her schools demand of a guardian which I was now, and my Uni\u2019s demand of just torture. Plus, I was late today, and our small sofa seat was getting delivered today. The stuff from my our old house had been sent to a storage space which my parents had bought, and we owned a small sofa piece and table set which we could fit in our apartment since we desperately needed a sitting structure.</p><p>After fighting with the delivery guy for the unnecessary extra amount he was charging to take it up one floor, I had him leave it downstairs. I was going to do it one at a time when I saw Harry coming in.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>He took off his earphones, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you help me? I need to take these up, and I don\u2019t have any help and I would really appreciate it,\u201d I begged.</p><p>He thought about it a bit, and then, nodded. Taking the table up the stairs, he asked, \u201cis this marble?\u201d looking at the countertop.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think it is,\u201d I said smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you living in a dump like this if you can buy a marble table?\u201d He said, and I could sense the disdain in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually my parents, from our old house. So, I didn\u2019t have to buy it actually. Just making use of things as much as we can,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI heard, I am sorry.\u201d He said as we went back down to get the sofa chair. \u201cHold it the other way,\u201d he instructed as we tried to get it up the stairs, but it was really heavy. Finally managing to take it inside my place, we sat down.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for helping me with this!\u201d I stood up and got him some water.</p><p>\u201cI should get going,\u201d he walked towards the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know we are making pesto chicken for dinner if you\u2019d like to join us. We found out that I am a good cook.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d He said walking out.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something?\u201d I asked, all of a sudden and then bit my tongue. He frowned. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t seem to like me, and I don\u2019t know you so, I\u2019m just, umm confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to like you?\u201d He said, irritated. The fact that he was actually really beautiful, made me want him to like me, and he clearly didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOkay, \u201c I gulped. \u201cThank you for helping me.\u201d I nodded, hiding behind my door.</p><p>Meera did her research on him and found out that my parents had actually placed a case on Harry\u2019s fathers business. They were the sharks in their field so, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. They used to be as wealthy as us, so we had a similar downfall. Only with him, the case ended with his father losing his business, and imprisonment for 10 years on stolen copyright. It was a serious deal. His mother remarried three years ago, and Harry has been cut off and living in the studio which was surprisingly all we both could afford. I could get why he didn\u2019t like me, but it wasn\u2019t my fault.</p><p>Another thing about Harry was that he had a line of women coming into his flat, and leaving early morning when my sister left for school. \u201cI think this is the 17th one,\u201d she whispered the other day, as I walked with her and we giggled about it. We had caught him in a towel, the day before when my sister knocked on his door for a toolbox, and it would have been a lie if I didn\u2019t drool a little. He had tattoos covering his sculpted stomach, his hand holding his towel on, with his hair wet, falling on his face, clean shaven so, you could see those sharp jawlines before my eyes shamefully met his big green ones, after I had stared and engrained everything else.</p><p>\u201cThose girls are very lucky,\u201d I whispered back to my sister, and she giggled some more.</p><p>He was really smart as well. Paying extra attention to my studies, I noticed who the class toppers were, and we were at the top. Well, he was. Girls talked a lot about him as well. I guess, he played the I don\u2019t care much about anything attitude well enough, making him that mysterious. I noticed he hung out with three guys, and two girls here and there. He mostly ignored me, even when we were on the same way home, and I couldn\u2019t help feeling small. And he always had the best stash of weed - some good connection of his.</p><p>I could do with some weed. The pressure was finally taking a toll on me and I needed a break. I felt like a full-time mother, with a full-time Uni schedule and a part-time job, and it was getting to me. I didn\u2019t have to do more than half it, just a few months ago. The lawyers said I was doing well with my sister, and my schedule and they don\u2019t have to take her away if I kept it up.</p><p>Wanting some that night, and knowing he had a good seller, I knocked on his door. He opened the door, raising his eyebrow. He was wearing a shirt which was buttoned down and tucked into his pants. I could see his tastes were still high fashion - it was the way we dressed and money didn\u2019t change that. I did now, know the best cheap places to keep the style up though. I gulped looking at his chest, and then, up to his eyes. I was also horny as fuck, and having my sister sleep next to me every day, didn\u2019t help. He didn\u2019t smirk like men usually did though, and it gave me the confidence to ask him if he had any on hand, if I could buy some of him for now, and get his contact.</p><p>\u201cThe rich girl can\u2019t walk down to a dispensary and get it for herself?\u201d That disdain again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rich anymore,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d \u00a0I calmed myself. \u201cI heard you have a good supplier, and I&hellip;it\u2019s cool. Thanks anyway.\u201d I shrugged. He made me want to crawl in bed and cry with the tone he used, and his expressions meant for me. \u00a0I was going to do just that when he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI was going to roll myself one, right now. Join me,\u201d he pulled his door wide and walked off inside. I nervously pulled my hair behind my ear and walked inside. His house, as small as mine, was spotlessly clean, and so well organised that it made mine look shabby.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d He asked as he sat down on the sofa, holding the grinder in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSleepover, friends,\u201d I told him. He raised his head up, nodding. \u201cDo you know how to roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, actually I never smoked that much,\u201d I said, waiting for the further judgement.</p><p>\u201cReally? What was your escape then?\u201d He asked, taking the paper out, and tearing a cardboard piece for the roach. His hands worked skillfully as he put the weed on the paper, looking at me for a reply.</p><p>\u201cUmm, escape?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cFrom the high society drama that you were a part of? I know, I needed an escape,\u201d I was a bit enchanted with how he pulled his tongue out to like the paper to roll the joint, that it took me a while to come back.</p><p>I played it cool, pulling my eyes away, \u201cUmm, I had a good family. Only needed an escape when I was really stressed which well didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, shall we?\u201d We walked to the balcony, and he lit the joint, taking a drag, and then handing it to me.</p><p>I took a smaller one, it being a few months since having smoked, and I didn\u2019t want to look like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d I asked, looking at the car park view in front of us.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d He should ask me back. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna pair up for Benjamin\u2019s class?\u201d I should shut up. I have no clue how I have such great ideas all the time. \u201cWe live here, so it\u2019ll just be easier to meet up, so I wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he didn\u2019t look impressed, as he took another drag before giving it to me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, and I was running out of things to talk about, but I was now high and could vouch for his stuff being really great. He threw the bud away, and we walked inside. \u201cGive me a list of what you want, I\u2019ll get it,\u201d He said, handing me a paper.</p><p>\u201cOh, I umm - I don\u2019t want a lot. My sister and I don\u2019t know how to roll,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your servant,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat- I- I didn\u2019t,\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf you could get me two pre-rolled - that would do for the while. Let me know how much I owe for it. Thank you for today.\u201d I said walking towards the door. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so hostile towards me, you know.\u201d This surge of confidence in me was induced for sure. \u201cI didn\u2019t do you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know? We have a history.\u201d He said, putting his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cOur parents have a history. I had nothing to do with the business, and I haven\u2019t met you before, even if we used to be in the same circle. I would remember you,\u201d I walked towards him, pointing a finger at his chest.</p><p>\u201cYour parents are the reason my home broke, and my dad\u2019s in prison!\u201d He snapped. \u201cThey had a choice to let him go, after destroying us, but he didn\u2019t stop. My mother left-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were not the reason your mother left! And your father probably deserved by law what happened to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure your parents deserved what happened to them!\u201d</p><p>I shut up. My brain was a bit slow to process the hurt and put it in front of me like bricks. But, it all came back. The memories, the blood, the sold sign in front of our house, my sister\u2019s howl, and my eyes went cloudy, as I sat down right there on his floor.</p><p>\u201cThey died,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry knelt down in front of me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>I was too far gone though, as I looked at my hands, realising that I hadn\u2019t cried since I last held them in my arms when, \u201dthere was so much blood,\u201d i showed him my hands, as he looked at me, my tears pouring out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t save anyone, I tried to-\u201d I said shivering now.</p><p>\u201cHey-hey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s alright,\u201d He wrapped his arms around me pulling me to his chest. I broke down in his arms.</p><p>The next thing, clear in my mind is waking up in a bed, Harry\u2019s bed with his arms still around me, holding me to his body. I shifted a little, back in my conscious head waking him up as well, and his eyes met mine. I kept my head, back on the pillow, not taking my eyes off of his, still having nothing to say. I had opened up to this man more, than literally anyone else. I could still feel his arm under my head, and his other hand wrapped around my waist, my body still attached to his, and I felt comfortable. I didn\u2019t want to read into this. I just wanted to let it be.</p><p>He shifted, pulling his hand up from below my head, and I got up, closer to his face, his eyes still on mine, and I instinctively bent down. My lips wrapping around his bottom one in a \u00a0kiss, as I pushed him down, towards the bed. I felt his hand, hold my face pulling us apart, as our eyes met again, looking for something. He found it, as he brought his lips back to mine, holding my face in his palms, pushing me back to his bed with a force which felt perfect in every way.</p><p style=\"\">&mdash;</p><p><b>Would love to know what you think of it?

The best they could do for me at the moment. Was it a downfall? A shattering one. Maybe shattering doesn\u2019t justify it. I didn\u2019t expect much from our relatives otherwise either.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cDo we have to stay here?\u201d My sister asked, looking at our tiny studio apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling,\u201d I said, pushing our boxes inside. We sold most of our stuff, including my parent\u2019s house which the bank took as collateral. If I wanted my sister to continue going to the private school, which would ensure her future, we had to make that sacrifice. We had limited funds, and thankfully my university was paid for and we had our scholarships, but our way of life, our expenses - everything took a huge hit. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can do something amazing with it!\u201d Decorate it like we always wanted to, but Mum never allowed us because of white walls?\u201d I tried to cheer her up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go against her now,\u201d She sighed, sitting on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAlright! You know what? Why don\u2019t you make me us some pancakes, and I\u2019ll get all the boxes inside, and we can then unpack?\u201d She nodded, always love the idea of cooking. I hope I could send her to the best school one day, but she was only 13, and I had time to worry about that.</p><p>I walked out, looking at the dingy corridor filled with my stuff, and a door on the opposite side. Should probably say Hi to my new neighbour - maybe bake some cookies as an exchange? Wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>I tried being strong in the entire process. Losing our home, our wealth, our everything took a strong hit, with our personal relationships as well. My boyfriend broke up with me, my friends who I used to hang out with me stopped texting when I shifted homes. They all knew about the loss of income, and my world had always been shallow. I had a list of things to mourn about and absolutely no time at the moment. \u00a0</p><p>Setting up the tiny studio was hard, but we managed to fit our stuff. I was proud of how well my sister was taking it, knowing how difficult it must be for her. \u201cExcited to go to school tomorrow? The bus, I found out, actually comes right down the lane, so it\u2019s not much walking-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do people care about money so much? How does it matter if we don\u2019t have it more of it, anymore? We have enough to still go to school. I am still me, then why are kids so shallow,\u201d My sister asked, and I felt like she had aged so much in the last month.</p><p>\u201cPeople are always shallow. You know how Mum made fun of all of Dad\u2019s friends? She got it as well! Remember that friends who leave you in your time of need, are not friends, to begin with, and you should always strive for true friendship. Always be kind, and hardworking and keep your head up high. We don\u2019t need anything else!\u201d She hugged me tightly, crying into my chest. I hope things aren\u2019t as hard for her.</p><p>If missing three weeks of University was bad, having your group of friends ignore you, while you tried to settle in was worse. Obviously, I didn\u2019t come in my Porsche, obviously, I took the train, and obviously, I went to the student cafe for lunch and not the restaurant like my old routine. Everyone knew what happened, what was there to gossip about?</p><p>Max, my ex-boyfriend came and sat beside me during the gap in my schedule. I stayed away, feeling the negativity and toxic air that I didn\u2019t want to interact. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say hi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you noticed people who didn\u2019t have the heritage money in the bank,\u201d I closed my book.</p><p>\u201cLook-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t deal with this, Max. You said enough at Cheryl\u2019s party, and I didn\u2019t realize how pathetic we were. I need to widen my horizon, find my people who don\u2019t make friends with bank accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d He argued.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you just laughed with Catherine and Misha. Same thing! And, you broke up with me. Two weeks after my parents- you should go!\u201d I stood up.</p><p>\u201cMy mother made me do that! You know how important standing is, you were a part of it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am still a part of it. I still have all my standing, all my recommendations in place because I didn\u2019t buy them as you did. I am better than you, all of you. I didn\u2019t love you for how much you could spend,\u201d Walking away from him, felt good. I didn\u2019t have the time to wallow.</p><p>I was still on top of my class. My professors expected write-ups but, I was on schedule to graduate by the end of the year. During lunch, my two friends who I honestly loved the most, and were secretly still there for me, came and sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThis place has amazing Mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese if you have to know! And, it\u2019s my cheat day!\u201d Kyle rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it!\u201d Meera hit him, hugging me tightly. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t tolerate Catherine without your sarcastic remarks! It was intolerable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you!\u201d Kyle took a bite of his cheat day dish. \u201cI expected you to take your place back, and you didn\u2019t even come and say hi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted you though,\u201d I blew him a kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Meera said, taking my hands, \u201cI never liked that group thing. Let\u2019s not do it again!\u201d I was glad that at least at least I was a person who had made tight, genuine bonds.</p><p>The train ride home was long. It took me 20 minutes with my car to reach home, but I didn\u2019t live in the central city anymore. I just had to get used to it. Distract myself, observe things in this 65-minute ride back home. A guy sat down in front of me after the old lady got off at her stop. His head was in his phone, earphones in, with his hoody on, and I had a feeling that he was in my class this afternoon. I didn\u2019t notice him, but he had his back to me when I saw him walk out of class, and I didn\u2019t know him. I tried for a while, wanting to make an eye-contact. Maybe he knew me? People knew me, in general. He got off at the same stop as me, and we walked the same way back home. I didn\u2019t have the guts to say Hi.</p><p>I stopped on my way to the grocery store. My sister told me about her day, and how her best friend was still her best friend, and I felt it might be alright for us here. We baked cookies for our neighbour, and I rang on the doorbell. The same guy in the train, from my class today opened the door, and the only way I could be sure was because it was the same hoody and the same body structure. I gave him my big smile, always worked with all the people, \u201cHi! My sister and I just moved in, and we baked you some cookies and introduce ourselves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are Y/N Y/L/N. What are you doing here?\u201d He said, shocked.</p><p>\u201cYou know me! I wanted to say Hi while we were on our way back but, didn\u2019t get the chance to do that!\u201d he frowned, looking a little pissed, and I wondered if I did something wrong. \u201cThis is my sister, Sara!\u201d I pulled her forward to ease the tension. He smiled at her, and I could see his dimples and my sister gave him the cookies.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sara! I\u2019m Harry\u201d He nodded. \u201cLet me know if you need anything.\u201d He said, talking to her and then closed the door on my face before I could speak.</p><p>\u201cDid you do something to him?\u201d My sister asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him!\u201d I said, turning to our door.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to like you,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t even know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is really handsome, though!\u201d She elbowed me.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The mystery grew further when Harry categorically avoided me for the next few weeks. Life wasn\u2019t exactly getting easy with asking my sister to control her expenses, and her crying, and trying to make food every day on top of managing a child, and then keeping in check with her schools demand of a guardian which I was now, and my Uni\u2019s demand of just torture. Plus, I was late today, and our small sofa seat was getting delivered today. The stuff from my our old house had been sent to a storage space which my parents had bought, and we owned a small sofa piece and table set which we could fit in our apartment since we desperately needed a sitting structure.</p><p>After fighting with the delivery guy for the unnecessary extra amount he was charging to take it up one floor, I had him leave it downstairs. I was going to do it one at a time when I saw Harry coming in.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>He took off his earphones, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you help me? I need to take these up, and I don\u2019t have any help and I would really appreciate it,\u201d I begged.</p><p>He thought about it a bit, and then, nodded. Taking the table up the stairs, he asked, \u201cis this marble?\u201d looking at the countertop.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think it is,\u201d I said smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you living in a dump like this if you can buy a marble table?\u201d He said, and I could sense the disdain in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually my parents, from our old house. So, I didn\u2019t have to buy it actually. Just making use of things as much as we can,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI heard, I am sorry.\u201d He said as we went back down to get the sofa chair. \u201cHold it the other way,\u201d he instructed as we tried to get it up the stairs, but it was really heavy. Finally managing to take it inside my place, we sat down.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for helping me with this!\u201d I stood up and got him some water.</p><p>\u201cI should get going,\u201d he walked towards the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know we are making pesto chicken for dinner if you\u2019d like to join us. We found out that I am a good cook.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d He said walking out.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something?\u201d I asked, all of a sudden and then bit my tongue. He frowned. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t seem to like me, and I don\u2019t know you so, I\u2019m just, umm confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to like you?\u201d He said, irritated. The fact that he was actually really beautiful, made me want him to like me, and he clearly didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOkay, \u201c I gulped. \u201cThank you for helping me.\u201d I nodded, hiding behind my door.</p><p>Meera did her research on him and found out that my parents had actually placed a case on Harry\u2019s fathers business. They were the sharks in their field so, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. They used to be as wealthy as us, so we had a similar downfall. Only with him, the case ended with his father losing his business, and imprisonment for 10 years on stolen copyright. It was a serious deal.

We had caught him in a towel, the day before when my sister knocked on his door for a toolbox, and it would have been a lie if I didn\u2019t drool a little. He had tattoos covering his sculpted stomach, his hand holding his towel on, with his hair wet, falling on his face, clean shaven so, you could see those sharp jawlines before my eyes shamefully met his big green ones, after I had stared and engrained everything else.</p><p>\u201cThose girls are very lucky,\u201d I whispered back to my sister, and she giggled some more.</p><p>He was really smart as well. Paying extra attention to my studies, I noticed who the class toppers were, and we were at the top. Well, he was. Girls talked a lot about him as well.

He mostly ignored me, even when we were on the same way home, and I couldn\u2019t help feeling small. And he always had the best stash of weed - some good connection of his.</p><p>I could do with some weed. The pressure was finally taking a toll on me and I needed a break. I felt like a full-time mother, with a full-time Uni schedule and a part-time job, and it was getting to me. I didn\u2019t have to do more than half it, just a few months ago. The lawyers said I was doing well with my sister, and my schedule and they don\u2019t have to take her away if I kept it up.</p><p>Wanting some that night, and knowing he had a good seller, I knocked on his door. He opened the door, raising his eyebrow. He was wearing a shirt which was buttoned down and tucked into his pants. I could see his tastes were still high fashion - it was the way we dressed and money didn\u2019t change that. I did now, know the best cheap places to keep the style up though. I gulped looking at his chest, and then, up to his eyes. I was also horny as fuck, and having my sister sleep next to me every day, didn\u2019t help. He didn\u2019t smirk like men usually did though, and it gave me the confidence to ask him if he had any on hand, if I could buy some of him for now, and get his contact.</p><p>\u201cThe rich girl can\u2019t walk down to a dispensary and get it for herself?\u201d That disdain again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rich anymore,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d \u00a0I calmed myself. \u201cI heard you have a good supplier, and I\u2026it\u2019s cool. Thanks anyway.\u201d I shrugged. He made me want to crawl in bed and cry with the tone he used, and his expressions meant for me. \u00a0I was going to do just that when he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI was going to roll myself one, right now. Join me,\u201d he pulled his door wide and walked off inside. I nervously pulled my hair behind my ear and walked inside. His house, as small as mine, was spotlessly clean, and so well organised that it made mine look shabby.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d He asked as he sat down on the sofa, holding the grinder in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSleepover, friends,\u201d I told him. He raised his head up, nodding. \u201cDo you know how to roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, actually I never smoked that much,\u201d I said, waiting for the further judgement.</p><p>\u201cReally? What was your escape then?\u201d He asked, taking the paper out, and tearing a cardboard piece for the roach. His hands worked skillfully as he put the weed on the paper, looking at me for a reply.</p><p>\u201cUmm, escape?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cFrom the high society drama that you were a part of? I know, I needed an escape,\u201d I was a bit enchanted with how he pulled his tongue out to like the paper to roll the joint, that it took me a while to come back.</p><p>I played it cool, pulling my eyes away, \u201cUmm, I had a good family. Only needed an escape when I was really stressed which well didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, shall we?\u201d We walked to the balcony, and he lit the joint, taking a drag, and then handing it to me.</p><p>I took a smaller one, it being a few months since having smoked, and I didn\u2019t want to look like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d I asked, looking at the car park view in front of us.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d He should ask me back. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna pair up for Benjamin\u2019s class?\u201d I should shut up. I have no clue how I have such great ideas all the time. \u201cWe live here, so it\u2019ll just be easier to meet up, so I wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he didn\u2019t look impressed, as he took another drag before giving it to me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, and I was running out of things to talk about, but I was now high and could vouch for his stuff being really great. He threw the bud away, and we walked inside. \u201cGive me a list of what you want, I\u2019ll get it,\u201d He said, handing me a paper.</p><p>\u201cOh, I umm - I don\u2019t want a lot. My sister and I don\u2019t know how to roll,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your servant,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat- I- I didn\u2019t,\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf you could get me two pre-rolled - that would do for the while. Let me know how much I owe for it. Thank you for today.\u201d I said walking towards the door. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so hostile towards me, you know.\u201d This surge of confidence in me was induced for sure. \u201cI didn\u2019t do you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know? We have a history.\u201d He said, putting his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cOur parents have a history. I had nothing to do with the business, and I haven\u2019t met you before, even if we used to be in the same circle. I would remember you,\u201d I walked towards him, pointing a finger at his chest.</p><p>\u201cYour parents are the reason my home broke, and my dad\u2019s in prison!\u201d He snapped. \u201cThey had a choice to let him go, after destroying us, but he didn\u2019t stop. My mother left-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were not the reason your mother left! And your father probably deserved by law what happened to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure your parents deserved what happened to them!\u201d</p><p>I shut up. My brain was a bit slow to process the hurt and put it in front of me like bricks. But, it all came back. The memories, the blood, the sold sign in front of our house, my sister\u2019s howl, and my eyes went cloudy, as I sat down right there on his floor.</p><p>\u201cThey died,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry knelt down in front of me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>I was too far gone though, as I looked at my hands, realising that I hadn\u2019t cried since I last held them in my arms when, \u201dthere was so much blood,\u201d i showed him my hands, as he looked at me, my tears pouring out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t save anyone, I tried to-\u201d I said shivering now.</p><p>\u201cHey-hey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s alright,\u201d He wrapped his arms around me pulling me to his chest. I broke down in his arms.</p><p>The next thing, clear in my mind is waking up in a bed, Harry\u2019s bed with his arms still around me, holding me to his body. I shifted a little, back in my conscious head waking him up as well, and his eyes met mine. I kept my head, back on the pillow, not taking my eyes off of his, still having nothing to say. I had opened up to this man more, than literally anyone else. I could still feel his arm under my head, and his other hand wrapped around my waist, my body still attached to his, and I felt comfortable. I didn\u2019t want to read into this. I just wanted to let it be.</p><p>He shifted, pulling his hand up from below my head, and I got up, closer to his face, his eyes still on mine, and I instinctively bent down. My lips wrapping around his bottom one in a \u00a0kiss, as I pushed him down, towards the bed. I felt his hand, hold my face pulling us apart, as our eyes met again, looking for something. He found it, as he brought his lips back to mine, holding my face in his palms, pushing me back to his bed with a force which felt perfect in every way.</p><p style=\"\">\u2014</p><p><b>Would love to know what you think of it?

But, I wrote after so long, I\u2019m happy.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>Concept: Rich Y/N has to shift into a small studio with her sister, bringing a complete change from their high society lifestyle. The owner of the studio right in front of them, Harry isn\u2019t too pleased with this move.\u00a0</b></p><p>Warnings: Weed, will have smut later.\u00a0</p><p><b>3.5K+</b></p><p><b>\u2014</b></p><p>This was the best they could do. The best they could do for me at the moment. Was it a downfall? A shattering one. Maybe shattering doesn\u2019t justify it. I didn\u2019t expect much from our relatives otherwise either.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cDo we have to stay here?\u201d My sister asked, looking at our tiny studio apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darling,\u201d I said, pushing our boxes inside. We sold most of our stuff, including my parent\u2019s house which the bank took as collateral. If I wanted my sister to continue going to the private school, which would ensure her future, we had to make that sacrifice. We had limited funds, and thankfully my university was paid for and we had our scholarships, but our way of life, our expenses - everything took a huge hit. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can do something amazing with it!\u201d Decorate it like we always wanted to, but Mum never allowed us because of white walls?\u201d I tried to cheer her up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go against her now,\u201d She sighed, sitting on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAlright! You know what? Why don\u2019t you make me us some pancakes, and I\u2019ll get all the boxes inside, and we can then unpack?\u201d She nodded, always love the idea of cooking. I hope I could send her to the best school one day, but she was only 13, and I had time to worry about that.</p><p>I walked out, looking at the dingy corridor filled with my stuff, and a door on the opposite side. Should probably say Hi to my new neighbour - maybe bake some cookies as an exchange? Wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>I tried being strong in the entire process. Losing our home, our wealth, our everything took a strong hit, with our personal relationships as well. My boyfriend broke up with me, my friends who I used to hang out with me stopped texting when I shifted homes. They all knew about the loss of income, and my world had always been shallow. I had a list of things to mourn about and absolutely no time at the moment. \u00a0</p><p>Setting up the tiny studio was hard, but we managed to fit our stuff. I was proud of how well my sister was taking it, knowing how difficult it must be for her. \u201cExcited to go to school tomorrow? The bus, I found out, actually comes right down the lane, so it\u2019s not much walking-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do people care about money so much? How does it matter if we don\u2019t have it more of it, anymore? We have enough to still go to school. I am still me, then why are kids so shallow,\u201d My sister asked, and I felt like she had aged so much in the last month.</p><p>\u201cPeople are always shallow. You know how Mum made fun of all of Dad\u2019s friends? She got it as well! Remember that friends who leave you in your time of need, are not friends, to begin with, and you should always strive for true friendship. Always be kind, and hardworking and keep your head up high. We don\u2019t need anything else!\u201d She hugged me tightly, crying into my chest. I hope things aren\u2019t as hard for her.</p><p>If missing three weeks of University was bad, having your group of friends ignore you, while you tried to settle in was worse. Obviously, I didn\u2019t come in my Porsche, obviously, I took the train, and obviously, I went to the student cafe for lunch and not the restaurant like my old routine. Everyone knew what happened, what was there to gossip about?</p><p>Max, my ex-boyfriend came and sat beside me during the gap in my schedule. I stayed away, feeling the negativity and toxic air that I didn\u2019t want to interact. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say hi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you noticed people who didn\u2019t have the heritage money in the bank,\u201d I closed my book.</p><p>\u201cLook-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t deal with this, Max. You said enough at Cheryl\u2019s party, and I didn\u2019t realize how pathetic we were. I need to widen my horizon, find my people who don\u2019t make friends with bank accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d He argued.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you just laughed with Catherine and Misha. Same thing! And, you broke up with me. Two weeks after my parents- you should go!\u201d I stood up.</p><p>\u201cMy mother made me do that! You know how important standing is, you were a part of it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am still a part of it. I still have all my standing, all my recommendations in place because I didn\u2019t buy them as you did. I am better than you, all of you. I didn\u2019t love you for how much you could spend,\u201d Walking away from him, felt good. I didn\u2019t have the time to wallow.</p><p>I was still on top of my class. My professors expected write-ups but, I was on schedule to graduate by the end of the year. During lunch, my two friends who I honestly loved the most, and were secretly still there for me, came and sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThis place has amazing Mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese if you have to know! And, it\u2019s my cheat day!\u201d Kyle rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it!\u201d Meera hit him, hugging me tightly. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t tolerate Catherine without your sarcastic remarks! It was intolerable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you!\u201d Kyle took a bite of his cheat day dish. \u201cI expected you to take your place back, and you didn\u2019t even come and say hi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted you though,\u201d I blew him a kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Meera said, taking my hands, \u201cI never liked that group thing. Let\u2019s not do it again!\u201d I was glad that at least at least I was a person who had made tight, genuine bonds.</p><p>The train ride home was long. It took me 20 minutes with my car to reach home, but I didn\u2019t live in the central city anymore. I just had to get used to it. Distract myself, observe things in this 65-minute ride back home. A guy sat down in front of me after the old lady got off at her stop. His head was in his phone, earphones in, with his hoody on, and I had a feeling that he was in my class this afternoon. I didn\u2019t notice him, but he had his back to me when I saw him walk out of class, and I didn\u2019t know him. I tried for a while, wanting to make an eye-contact. Maybe he knew me? People knew me, in general. He got off at the same stop as me, and we walked the same way back home. I didn\u2019t have the guts to say Hi.</p><p>I stopped on my way to the grocery store. My sister told me about her day, and how her best friend was still her best friend, and I felt it might be alright for us here. We baked cookies for our neighbour, and I rang on the doorbell. The same guy in the train, from my class today opened the door, and the only way I could be sure was because it was the same hoody and the same body structure. I gave him my big smile, always worked with all the people, \u201cHi! My sister and I just moved in, and we baked you some cookies and introduce ourselves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are Y/N Y/L/N. What are you doing here?\u201d He said, shocked.</p><p>\u201cYou know me! I wanted to say Hi while we were on our way back but, didn\u2019t get the chance to do that!\u201d he frowned, looking a little pissed, and I wondered if I did something wrong. \u201cThis is my sister, Sara!\u201d I pulled her forward to ease the tension. He smiled at her, and I could see his dimples and my sister gave him the cookies.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sara! I\u2019m Harry\u201d He nodded. \u201cLet me know if you need anything.\u201d He said, talking to her and then closed the door on my face before I could speak.</p><p>\u201cDid you do something to him?\u201d My sister asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him!\u201d I said, turning to our door.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to like you,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t even know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is really handsome, though!\u201d She elbowed me.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The mystery grew further when Harry categorically avoided me for the next few weeks. Life wasn\u2019t exactly getting easy with asking my sister to control her expenses, and her crying, and trying to make food every day on top of managing a child, and then keeping in check with her schools demand of a guardian which I was now, and my Uni\u2019s demand of just torture. Plus, I was late today, and our small sofa seat was getting delivered today. The stuff from my our old house had been sent to a storage space which my parents had bought, and we owned a small sofa piece and table set which we could fit in our apartment since we desperately needed a sitting structure.</p><p>After fighting with the delivery guy for the unnecessary extra amount he was charging to take it up one floor, I had him leave it downstairs. I was going to do it one at a time when I saw Harry coming in.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>He took off his earphones, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you help me? I need to take these up, and I don\u2019t have any help and I would really appreciate it,\u201d I begged.</p><p>He thought about it a bit, and then, nodded. Taking the table up the stairs, he asked, \u201cis this marble?\u201d looking at the countertop.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think it is,\u201d I said smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you living in a dump like this if you can buy a marble table?\u201d He said, and I could sense the disdain in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually my parents, from our old house. So, I didn\u2019t have to buy it actually. Just making use of things as much as we can,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI heard, I am sorry.\u201d He said as we went back down to get the sofa chair. \u201cHold it the other way,\u201d he instructed as we tried to get it up the stairs, but it was really heavy. Finally managing to take it inside my place, we sat down.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for helping me with this!\u201d I stood up and got him some water.</p><p>\u201cI should get going,\u201d he walked towards the door.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know we are making pesto chicken for dinner if you\u2019d like to join us. We found out that I am a good cook.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d He said walking out.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something?\u201d I asked, all of a sudden and then bit my tongue. He frowned. \u201cI mean, you don\u2019t seem to like me, and I don\u2019t know you so, I\u2019m just, umm confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to like you?\u201d He said, irritated. The fact that he was actually really beautiful, made me want him to like me, and he clearly didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOkay, \u201c I gulped. \u201cThank you for helping me.\u201d I nodded, hiding behind my door.</p><p>Meera did her research on him and found out that my parents had actually placed a case on Harry\u2019s fathers business. They were the sharks in their field so, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. They used to be as wealthy as us, so we had a similar downfall. Only with him, the case ended with his father losing his business, and imprisonment for 10 years on stolen copyright. It was a serious deal. His mother remarried three years ago, and Harry has been cut off and living in the studio which was surprisingly all we both could afford. I could get why he didn\u2019t like me, but it wasn\u2019t my fault.</p><p>Another thing about Harry was that he had a line of women coming into his flat, and leaving early morning when my sister left for school. \u201cI think this is the 17th one,\u201d she whispered the other day, as I walked with her and we giggled about it. We had caught him in a towel, the day before when my sister knocked on his door for a toolbox, and it would have been a lie if I didn\u2019t drool a little. He had tattoos covering his sculpted stomach, his hand holding his towel on, with his hair wet, falling on his face, clean shaven so, you could see those sharp jawlines before my eyes shamefully met his big green ones, after I had stared and engrained everything else.</p><p>\u201cThose girls are very lucky,\u201d I whispered back to my sister, and she giggled some more.</p><p>He was really smart as well. Paying extra attention to my studies, I noticed who the class toppers were, and we were at the top. Well, he was. Girls talked a lot about him as well. I guess, he played the I don\u2019t care much about anything attitude well enough, making him that mysterious. I noticed he hung out with three guys, and two girls here and there. He mostly ignored me, even when we were on the same way home, and I couldn\u2019t help feeling small. And he always had the best stash of weed - some good connection of his.</p><p>I could do with some weed. The pressure was finally taking a toll on me and I needed a break. I felt like a full-time mother, with a full-time Uni schedule and a part-time job, and it was getting to me. I didn\u2019t have to do more than half it, just a few months ago. The lawyers said I was doing well with my sister, and my schedule and they don\u2019t have to take her away if I kept it up.</p><p>Wanting some that night, and knowing he had a good seller, I knocked on his door. He opened the door, raising his eyebrow. He was wearing a shirt which was buttoned down and tucked into his pants. I could see his tastes were still high fashion - it was the way we dressed and money didn\u2019t change that. I did now, know the best cheap places to keep the style up though. I gulped looking at his chest, and then, up to his eyes. I was also horny as fuck, and having my sister sleep next to me every day, didn\u2019t help. He didn\u2019t smirk like men usually did though, and it gave me the confidence to ask him if he had any on hand, if I could buy some of him for now, and get his contact.</p><p>\u201cThe rich girl can\u2019t walk down to a dispensary and get it for herself?\u201d That disdain again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rich anymore,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d \u00a0I calmed myself. \u201cI heard you have a good supplier, and I\u2026it\u2019s cool. Thanks anyway.\u201d I shrugged. He made me want to crawl in bed and cry with the tone he used, and his expressions meant for me. \u00a0I was going to do just that when he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI was going to roll myself one, right now. Join me,\u201d he pulled his door wide and walked off inside. I nervously pulled my hair behind my ear and walked inside. His house, as small as mine, was spotlessly clean, and so well organised that it made mine look shabby.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d He asked as he sat down on the sofa, holding the grinder in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSleepover, friends,\u201d I told him. He raised his head up, nodding. \u201cDo you know how to roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, actually I never smoked that much,\u201d I said, waiting for the further judgement.</p><p>\u201cReally? What was your escape then?\u201d He asked, taking the paper out, and tearing a cardboard piece for the roach. His hands worked skillfully as he put the weed on the paper, looking at me for a reply.</p><p>\u201cUmm, escape?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cFrom the high society drama that you were a part of? I know, I needed an escape,\u201d I was a bit enchanted with how he pulled his tongue out to like the paper to roll the joint, that it took me a while to come back.</p><p>I played it cool, pulling my eyes away, \u201cUmm, I had a good family. Only needed an escape when I was really stressed which well didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, shall we?\u201d We walked to the balcony, and he lit the joint, taking a drag, and then handing it to me.</p><p>I took a smaller one, it being a few months since having smoked, and I didn\u2019t want to look like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d I asked, looking at the car park view in front of us.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d He should ask me back. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna pair up for Benjamin\u2019s class?\u201d I should shut up. I have no clue how I have such great ideas all the time. \u201cWe live here, so it\u2019ll just be easier to meet up, so I wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he didn\u2019t look impressed, as he took another drag before giving it to me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, and I was running out of things to talk about, but I was now high and could vouch for his stuff being really great. He threw the bud away, and we walked inside. \u201cGive me a list of what you want, I\u2019ll get it,\u201d He said, handing me a paper.</p><p>\u201cOh, I umm - I don\u2019t want a lot. My sister and I don\u2019t know how to roll,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your servant,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat- I- I didn\u2019t,\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf you could get me two pre-rolled - that would do for the while. Let me know how much I owe for it. Thank you for today.\u201d I said walking towards the door. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so hostile towards me, you know.\u201d This surge of confidence in me was induced for sure. \u201cI didn\u2019t do you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know? We have a history.\u201d He said, putting his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cOur parents have a history. I had nothing to do with the business, and I haven\u2019t met you before, even if we used to be in the same circle. I would remember you,\u201d I walked towards him, pointing a finger at his chest.</p><p>\u201cYour parents are the reason my home broke, and my dad\u2019s in prison!\u201d He snapped. \u201cThey had a choice to let him go, after destroying us, but he didn\u2019t stop. My mother left-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents were not the reason your mother left! And your father probably deserved by law what happened to him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure your parents deserved what happened to them!\u201d</p><p>I shut up. My brain was a bit slow to process the hurt and put it in front of me like bricks. But, it all came back. The memories, the blood, the sold sign in front of our house, my sister\u2019s howl, and my eyes went cloudy, as I sat down right there on his floor.</p><p>\u201cThey died,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry knelt down in front of me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>I was too far gone though, as I looked at my hands, realising that I hadn\u2019t cried since I last held them in my arms when, \u201dthere was so much blood,\u201d i showed him my hands, as he looked at me, my tears pouring out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t save anyone, I tried to-\u201d I said shivering now.</p><p>\u201cHey-hey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s alright,\u201d He wrapped his arms around me pulling me to his chest. I broke down in his arms.</p><p>The next thing, clear in my mind is waking up in a bed, Harry\u2019s bed with his arms still around me, holding me to his body. I shifted a little, back in my conscious head waking him up as well, and his eyes met mine. I kept my head, back on the pillow, not taking my eyes off of his, still having nothing to say. I had opened up to this man more, than literally anyone else. I could still feel his arm under my head, and his other hand wrapped around my waist, my body still attached to his, and I felt comfortable. I didn\u2019t want to read into this. I just wanted to let it be.</p><p>He shifted, pulling his hand up from below my head, and I got up, closer to his face, his eyes still on mine, and I instinctively bent down. My lips wrapping around his bottom one in a \u00a0kiss, as I pushed him down, towards the bed. I felt his hand, hold my face pulling us apart, as our eyes met again, looking for something. He found it, as he brought his lips back to mine, holding my face in his palms, pushing me back to his bed with a force which felt perfect in every way.</p><p style=\"\">\u2014</p><p><b>Would love to know what you think of it?

                "content": "<p><b>I think I have done a terrible job. But, I wrote after so long, I&rsquo;m happy.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Concept: Rich Y/N has to shift into a small studio with her sister, bringing a complete change from their high society lifestyle. The owner of the studio right in front of them, Harry isn&rsquo;t too pleased with this move.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Warnings: Weed, will have smut later.&nbsp;</p><p><b>3.5K+</b></p><p><b>&mdash;</b></p><p>This was the best they could do. The best they could do for me at the moment. Was it a downfall? A shattering one. Maybe shattering doesn&rsquo;t justify it. I didn&rsquo;t expect much from our relatives otherwise either.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Do we have to stay here?&rdquo; My sister asked, looking at our tiny studio apartment.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, darling,&rdquo; I said, pushing our boxes inside. We sold most of our stuff, including my parent&rsquo;s house which the bank took as collateral. If I wanted my sister to continue going to the private school, which would ensure her future, we had to make that sacrifice. We had limited funds, and thankfully my university was paid for and we had our scholarships, but our way of life, our expenses - everything took a huge hit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can do something amazing with it!&rdquo; Decorate it like we always wanted to, but Mum never allowed us because of white walls?&rdquo; I tried to cheer her up.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I want to go against her now,&rdquo; She sighed, sitting on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright! You know what? Why don&rsquo;t you make me us some pancakes, and I&rsquo;ll get all the boxes inside, and we can then unpack?&rdquo; She nodded, always love the idea of cooking. I hope I could send her to the best school one day, but she was only 13, and I had time to worry about that.</p><p>I walked out, looking at the dingy corridor filled with my stuff, and a door on the opposite side. Should probably say Hi to my new neighbour - maybe bake some cookies as an exchange? Wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p><p>I tried being strong in the entire process. Losing our home, our wealth, our everything took a strong hit, with our personal relationships as well. My boyfriend broke up with me, my friends who I used to hang out with me stopped texting when I shifted homes. They all knew about the loss of income, and my world had always been shallow. I had a list of things to mourn about and absolutely no time at the moment. &nbsp;</p><p>Setting up the tiny studio was hard, but we managed to fit our stuff. I was proud of how well my sister was taking it, knowing how difficult it must be for her. &ldquo;Excited to go to school tomorrow? The bus, I found out, actually comes right down the lane, so it&rsquo;s not much walking-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do people care about money so much? How does it matter if we don&rsquo;t have it more of it, anymore? We have enough to still go to school. I am still me, then why are kids so shallow,&rdquo; My sister asked, and I felt like she had aged so much in the last month.</p><p>&ldquo;People are always shallow. You know how Mum made fun of all of Dad&rsquo;s friends? She got it as well! Remember that friends who leave you in your time of need, are not friends, to begin with, and you should always strive for true friendship. Always be kind, and hardworking and keep your head up high. We don&rsquo;t need anything else!&rdquo; She hugged me tightly, crying into my chest. I hope things aren&rsquo;t as hard for her.</p><p>If missing three weeks of University was bad, having your group of friends ignore you, while you tried to settle in was worse. Obviously, I didn&rsquo;t come in my Porsche, obviously, I took the train, and obviously, I went to the student cafe for lunch and not the restaurant like my old routine. Everyone knew what happened, what was there to gossip about?</p><p>Max, my ex-boyfriend came and sat beside me during the gap in my schedule. I stayed away, feeling the negativity and toxic air that I didn&rsquo;t want to interact. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say hi,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you noticed people who didn&rsquo;t have the heritage money in the bank,&rdquo; I closed my book.</p><p>&ldquo;Look-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deal with this, Max. You said enough at Cheryl&rsquo;s party, and I didn&rsquo;t realize how pathetic we were. I need to widen my horizon, find my people who don&rsquo;t make friends with bank accounts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything!&rdquo; He argued.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you just laughed with Catherine and Misha. Same thing! And, you broke up with me. Two weeks after my parents- you should go!&rdquo; I stood up.</p><p>&ldquo;My mother made me do that! You know how important standing is, you were a part of it-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am still a part of it. I still have all my standing, all my recommendations in place because I didn&rsquo;t buy them as you did. I am better than you, all of you. I didn&rsquo;t love you for how much you could spend,&rdquo; Walking away from him, felt good. I didn&rsquo;t have the time to wallow.</p><p>I was still on top of my class. My professors expected write-ups but, I was on schedule to graduate by the end of the year. During lunch, my two friends who I honestly loved the most, and were secretly still there for me, came and sat beside me.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you guys doing here?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;This place has amazing Mac &lsquo;n&rsquo; cheese if you have to know! And, it&rsquo;s my cheat day!&rdquo; Kyle rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, stop it!&rdquo; Meera hit him, hugging me tightly. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t tolerate Catherine without your sarcastic remarks! It was intolerable!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still mad at you!&rdquo; Kyle took a bite of his cheat day dish. &ldquo;I expected you to take your place back, and you didn&rsquo;t even come and say hi!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I texted you though,&rdquo; I blew him a kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Meera said, taking my hands, &ldquo;I never liked that group thing. Let&rsquo;s not do it again!&rdquo; I was glad that at least at least I was a person who had made tight, genuine bonds.</p><p>The train ride home was long. It took me 20 minutes with my car to reach home, but I didn&rsquo;t live in the central city anymore. I just had to get used to it. Distract myself, observe things in this 65-minute ride back home. A guy sat down in front of me after the old lady got off at her stop. His head was in his phone, earphones in, with his hoody on, and I had a feeling that he was in my class this afternoon. I didn&rsquo;t notice him, but he had his back to me when I saw him walk out of class, and I didn&rsquo;t know him. I tried for a while, wanting to make an eye-contact. Maybe he knew me? People knew me, in general. He got off at the same stop as me, and we walked the same way back home. I didn&rsquo;t have the guts to say Hi.</p><p>I stopped on my way to the grocery store. My sister told me about her day, and how her best friend was still her best friend, and I felt it might be alright for us here. We baked cookies for our neighbour, and I rang on the doorbell. The same guy in the train, from my class today opened the door, and the only way I could be sure was because it was the same hoody and the same body structure. I gave him my big smile, always worked with all the people, &ldquo;Hi! My sister and I just moved in, and we baked you some cookies and introduce ourselves!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are Y/N Y/L/N. What are you doing here?&rdquo; He said, shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;You know me! I wanted to say Hi while we were on our way back but, didn&rsquo;t get the chance to do that!&rdquo; he frowned, looking a little pissed, and I wondered if I did something wrong. &ldquo;This is my sister, Sara!&rdquo; I pulled her forward to ease the tension. He smiled at her, and I could see his dimples and my sister gave him the cookies.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sara! I&rsquo;m Harry&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;Let me know if you need anything.&rdquo; He said, talking to her and then closed the door on my face before I could speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you do something to him?&rdquo; My sister asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him!&rdquo; I said, turning to our door.</p><p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to like you,&rdquo; she said, laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I don&rsquo;t even know why.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is really handsome, though!&rdquo; She elbowed me.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>The mystery grew further when Harry categorically avoided me for the next few weeks. Life wasn&rsquo;t exactly getting easy with asking my sister to control her expenses, and her crying, and trying to make food every day on top of managing a child, and then keeping in check with her schools demand of a guardian which I was now, and my Uni&rsquo;s demand of just torture. Plus, I was late today, and our small sofa seat was getting delivered today. The stuff from my our old house had been sent to a storage space which my parents had bought, and we owned a small sofa piece and table set which we could fit in our apartment since we desperately needed a sitting structure.</p><p>After fighting with the delivery guy for the unnecessary extra amount he was charging to take it up one floor, I had him leave it downstairs. I was going to do it one at a time when I saw Harry coming in.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; I shouted.</p><p>He took off his earphones, &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could you help me? I need to take these up, and I don&rsquo;t have any help and I would really appreciate it,&rdquo; I begged.</p><p>He thought about it a bit, and then, nodded. Taking the table up the stairs, he asked, &ldquo;is this marble?&rdquo; looking at the countertop.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think it is,&rdquo; I said smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you living in a dump like this if you can buy a marble table?&rdquo; He said, and I could sense the disdain in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually my parents, from our old house. So, I didn&rsquo;t have to buy it actually. Just making use of things as much as we can,&rdquo; I told him.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard, I am sorry.&rdquo; He said as we went back down to get the sofa chair. &ldquo;Hold it the other way,&rdquo; he instructed as we tried to get it up the stairs, but it was really heavy. Finally managing to take it inside my place, we sat down.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much for helping me with this!&rdquo; I stood up and got him some water.</p><p>&ldquo;I should get going,&rdquo; he walked towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know we are making pesto chicken for dinner if you&rsquo;d like to join us. We found out that I am a good cook.&rdquo; I smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; He said walking out.</p><p>&ldquo;Did I do something?&rdquo; I asked, all of a sudden and then bit my tongue. He frowned. &ldquo;I mean, you don&rsquo;t seem to like me, and I don&rsquo;t know you so, I&rsquo;m just, umm confused.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I supposed to like you?&rdquo; He said, irritated. The fact that he was actually really beautiful, made me want him to like me, and he clearly didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, &ldquo; I gulped. &ldquo;Thank you for helping me.&rdquo; I nodded, hiding behind my door.</p><p>Meera did her research on him and found out that my parents had actually placed a case on Harry&rsquo;s fathers business. They were the sharks in their field so, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised. They used to be as wealthy as us, so we had a similar downfall. Only with him, the case ended with his father losing his business, and imprisonment for 10 years on stolen copyright. It was a serious deal. His mother remarried three years ago, and Harry has been cut off and living in the studio which was surprisingly all we both could afford. I could get why he didn&rsquo;t like me, but it wasn&rsquo;t my fault.</p><p>Another thing about Harry was that he had a line of women coming into his flat, and leaving early morning when my sister left for school. &ldquo;I think this is the 17th one,&rdquo; she whispered the other day, as I walked with her and we giggled about it. We had caught him in a towel, the day before when my sister knocked on his door for a toolbox, and it would have been a lie if I didn&rsquo;t drool a little. He had tattoos covering his sculpted stomach, his hand holding his towel on, with his hair wet, falling on his face, clean shaven so, you could see those sharp jawlines before my eyes shamefully met his big green ones, after I had stared and engrained everything else.</p><p>&ldquo;Those girls are very lucky,&rdquo; I whispered back to my sister, and she giggled some more.</p><p>He was really smart as well. Paying extra attention to my studies, I noticed who the class toppers were, and we were at the top. Well, he was. Girls talked a lot about him as well. I guess, he played the I don&rsquo;t care much about anything attitude well enough, making him that mysterious. I noticed he hung out with three guys, and two girls here and there. He mostly ignored me, even when we were on the same way home, and I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling small. And he always had the best stash of weed - some good connection of his.</p><p>I could do with some weed. The pressure was finally taking a toll on me and I needed a break. I felt like a full-time mother, with a full-time Uni schedule and a part-time job, and it was getting to me. I didn&rsquo;t have to do more than half it, just a few months ago. The lawyers said I was doing well with my sister, and my schedule and they don&rsquo;t have to take her away if I kept it up.</p><p>Wanting some that night, and knowing he had a good seller, I knocked on his door. He opened the door, raising his eyebrow. He was wearing a shirt which was buttoned down and tucked into his pants. I could see his tastes were still high fashion - it was the way we dressed and money didn&rsquo;t change that. I did now, know the best cheap places to keep the style up though. I gulped looking at his chest, and then, up to his eyes. I was also horny as fuck, and having my sister sleep next to me every day, didn&rsquo;t help. He didn&rsquo;t smirk like men usually did though, and it gave me the confidence to ask him if he had any on hand, if I could buy some of him for now, and get his contact.</p><p>&ldquo;The rich girl can&rsquo;t walk down to a dispensary and get it for herself?&rdquo; That disdain again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rich anymore,&rdquo; I snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; &nbsp;I calmed myself. &ldquo;I heard you have a good supplier, and I&hellip;it&rsquo;s cool. Thanks anyway.&rdquo; I shrugged. He made me want to crawl in bed and cry with the tone he used, and his expressions meant for me. &nbsp;I was going to do just that when he stopped me.</p><p>&ldquo;I was going to roll myself one, right now. Join me,&rdquo; he pulled his door wide and walked off inside. I nervously pulled my hair behind my ear and walked inside. His house, as small as mine, was spotlessly clean, and so well organised that it made mine look shabby.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is your sister?&rdquo; He asked as he sat down on the sofa, holding the grinder in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Sleepover, friends,&rdquo; I told him. He raised his head up, nodding. &ldquo;Do you know how to roll?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, actually I never smoked that much,&rdquo; I said, waiting for the further judgement.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? What was your escape then?&rdquo; He asked, taking the paper out, and tearing a cardboard piece for the roach. His hands worked skillfully as he put the weed on the paper, looking at me for a reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, escape?&rdquo; I frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;From the high society drama that you were a part of? I know, I needed an escape,&rdquo; I was a bit enchanted with how he pulled his tongue out to like the paper to roll the joint, that it took me a while to come back.</p><p>I played it cool, pulling my eyes away, &ldquo;Umm, I had a good family. Only needed an escape when I was really stressed which well didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough, shall we?&rdquo; We walked to the balcony, and he lit the joint, taking a drag, and then handing it to me.</p><p>I took a smaller one, it being a few months since having smoked, and I didn&rsquo;t want to look like an idiot.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how was your day?&rdquo; I asked, looking at the car park view in front of us.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; He should ask me back. He didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna pair up for Benjamin&rsquo;s class?&rdquo; I should shut up. I have no clue how I have such great ideas all the time. &ldquo;We live here, so it&rsquo;ll just be easier to meet up, so I wondered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t look impressed, as he took another drag before giving it to me.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t respond, and I was running out of things to talk about, but I was now high and could vouch for his stuff being really great. He threw the bud away, and we walked inside. &ldquo;Give me a list of what you want, I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; He said, handing me a paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I umm - I don&rsquo;t want a lot.

Hearing Midnight Memories and seeing Zayn\u2019s face on the album cover at a house party in 2013 might have been what drew me to become a fan but Harry is who made me stay.  I dig his sound, how kind he is, love the way he makes people feel safe,although he\u2019s got all the makings to be the stereotypical pop star he rejects all of that, and the interesting way he treats interviews make me laugh.  Then I became a Larry in 2015 and well here I am.",
