In fact, it was rainy all the time. It wasn\u2019t heavy rain, but if you listened closely enough, you could definitely hear the sound of raindrops tap-tapping against the windows of the apartment. Where there is rain, there are clouds, and sure enough, the dome above the skyscrapers of New York was grey and cool. You often hear of people whose moods eventually match the weather outside, but you never hear the opposite. One\u2019s happiness does not mean the sun will come out and make everyone feel warm. Yet somehow, with Peter\u2019s broken heart came the storms outside his apartment in Queens. It was as though the sky had heard him sob in the night and had started to cry with him, accompanying him throughout his lonely journey to recovery.<b><br/></b></p><p>Recovery was far from being achieved. Peter had been holed up in his home for months, refusing to speak to anyone, refusing to face the city and it\u2019s problems. Peter couldn\u2019t do anything - not even breathe before the urge to throw up or start sobbing uncontrollably emerged; he was a mess. He felt empty, yet his tears never ceased. He\u2019d find himself lying on the floor, wiping at his eyes over and over again, wondering how he was still able to cry, how he still had enough energy to do so. </p><!-- more --><p>The worst moments were when he\u2019d get up from whatever surface he\u2019d been lying on and go to the fridge, or the bathroom, or the fire escape, or the hall. The fact was, anytime he went anywhere in his little apartment, anytime his bloodshot eyes would fall onto a particular object, be it a magnet, or a toothbrush or the old ashtray outside, and he\u2019d be thrown back into old memories, excruciating memories he had been trying to leave behind for months. </p><p>With one glance, he\u2019d be sent to a time where pain was ignored and replaced by temporary bliss. He had tried, he had worked for so long to make that happiness last, but it hadn\u2019t stuck. When a vase you adore more than anything in the world is broken, you do whatever it takes to repair it, even if it means gluing every little piece of porcelain back together, even if it takes you months to do so. But sometimes, when you try and fix what has been broken, you end up breaking something far more important: yourself. </p><p>Peter had learned that the hard way. And perhaps it was too late, maybe he was unmendable. That would explain why hadn\u2019t stopped hurting ever since she had disappeared from his life. </p><p>It was about half past four in the afternoon. The rain was still pouring onto the streets of New York and because of that, the usual sound of traffic didn\u2019t fill Peter\u2019s ears. In fact, the apartment was dead silent.</p><p>Peter was lying on his stomach on his unmade bed, his head facing the wall in front of him. His arms lay on either sides of his body, motionless as though he couldn\u2019t feel them. He barely blinked as he kept on staring at the light grey wall. His eyes were tired and the huge circles beneath them were proof that he hadn\u2019t slept in a while. </p><p>Then all of a sudden, the sound of the home telephone ringing snapped Peter out of his daze and he pulled his eyes away from the wall, instead turning around slowly to look at the object from across the hall. The cordless phone was resting on a small coffee table right next to the front door. As Peter looked at it, he felt a pang of anger fill his chest and he stood up, calmly. </p><p>Placing one foot in front of the other, he slowly made his way out his bedroom and into the main room. He ignored the area, including his Spiderman mask that had been left forgotten in the corner of the room with a bunch of other mundane objects, his cold gaze still focused on the phone who hadn\u2019t stopped ringing yet. Finally, he reached the front door and with a darkness in his eyes, Peter grabbed the phone and immediately hurtled it at the floor, smashing it to pieces. The ringing stopped instantly, but the sound of the impact echoed in Peter\u2019s mind, the previous silence long forgotten. </p><p>Barely avoiding the pile of phone fragments, the young man walked into his kitchen and stopped in front of his fridge. Sure enough, a memory started seeping back in Peter\u2019s head and he winced as the hurt settled in. </p><p><i>\u201cWe have beer, tomatoes, milk that\u2019s gone bad and what looks like cheese but I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d</i></p><p>Peter shook his head aggressively, trying to block out the memory of her voice, desperately. But in vain. As her words sneakily crept into his mind, Peter violently punched the fridge, yelping as pain erupted in his balled up hand and he stumbled backwards, his back eventually hitting the tiled wall. He slid down and landed on the dusty floor. He hadn\u2019t cleaned up the apartment in weeks. Breathing heavily, Peter buried his face and his hands and started sobbing, the action so strong he shook with every tear. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he couldn\u2019t handle the pain. It was too much. He felt like his insides were being torn apart over and over again. Every time he did anything, he felt sick to his stomach with grief and sadness. He would do anything, anything at all to get rid of it all, to get rid of the feeling he\u2019d get whenever he remembered her face, or her perfume, or the way she talked. He was desperate. </p><p>Then suddenly, he lifted his head, fat tears still rolling down his flushed cheeks. </p><p>The reason why he couldn\u2019t get over what had happened to him was because every little thing was still engraved in his mind, and evidence was displayed everywhere around his apartment. Everywhere he looked, she was there, along with her remains. So in order for him to move on, maybe all he needed to do was forget. Forget the girl, forget the pain, and live. After so many months of sadness and misery, maybe he\u2019d be able to achieve the recovery he\u2019d been trying so hard to reach. </p><p>But he would have to forget everything, every single detail of the past year and a half that concerned the subject of his nightmares. How does one forget so much?</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, with the help of a certain Tony Stark. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tonydaily:P7l-C35bbf4YCGAg0XppFA:ZdevyX2fJEB8m\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b95792a12b2cd9c21f23af6425c5fa8/tumblr_pkxlr392B21y08szqo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\"/></figure><p>After changing into some clean clothes, Peter took a cab and about an hour later, he arrived at the Avengers Facility. Peter hoarsely thanked the cab driver before turning around. His eyes rested on the large A that decorated the imposing building, the A he had once proudly considered himself a part of. He hadn\u2019t come here in months.</p><p>Peter started walking towards the building, his feet occasionally walking into small puddles, but he didn\u2019t care about that nor did he care about the rain pouring down on him. He had to find Tony.</p><p>Inside the facility, warm air enveloped Peter\u2019s humid body. He had missed this place, he realised. He\u2019d missed the glass doors and tall concrete walls, and that feeling he got whenever he walked through those main doors. That feeling of responsibility. </p><p>It had been a while, but the only difference between now and then was that now he wasn\u2019t here because of his responsibility. It wasn\u2019t like before, and that fact made him feel even worse.</p><p>The main hall was empty, no one was there. Peter didn\u2019t dwell on it and walked in the direction of the elevators, moving fast when he suddenly heard his name being called. He halted and hesitantly, he turned around, his eyes resting on Natasha. </p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d she asked, eyes wide in shock. She hadn\u2019t seen him in so long, no one had.</p><p>At the sight of his old friend and teammate, Peter\u2019s eyes welled up and for a minute Natasha could have sworn he was going to come over there and hug her, but he didn\u2019t. Instead he shook his head, wiping away his fresh tears as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI have to see Mr. Stark,\u201d he said, his voice wobbly and breaking mid-sentence. </p><p>Without saying anything else, Peter turned his back on Natasha and pressed the elevator button. The doors opened and he entered swiftly, trying to get away from the blonde woman he missed dearly. If he couldn\u2019t face her, how could he face Mr. Stark? No, he couldn\u2019t try and back out now. He needed Tony.</p><p>Peter nodded with resolve and pushed his fears and troubling thoughts from his mind. Or at least he tried to.</p><p>As the elevator went further up, Peter\u2019s heart started beating faster and faster, his breath shortening. His hands were moist and not because of the rain that had greeted him outside. He was nervous, in fact he was terrified. He hadn\u2019t talked to Tony in so long, too long. The truth was, he had been ashamed of himself. Ashamed of his behavior during the past few months, ashamed of his emotional turmoil. He had always wanted Tony to think he was strong and fearless, but the truth was he was weak. Peter didn\u2019t want to let his hero down, yet throughout every passing minute of his self-inflicted house arrest, he had done just that.</p><p>The doors opening interrupted Peter\u2019s racing thoughts and he took a shaky breath before hesitantly leaving the elevator. </p><p>The main room was just like he remembered it. There were big black leather couches in the center of the room that had been bought by Tony a few months after the Avengers had brought back the victims of Thanos\u2019 attack on the universe, and Peter remembers because he\u2019d helped to pick them out. Glass bookshelves and tables rested in every corner of the room, a large aluminum chandelier hung from the shiny white ceiling, and nothing really had changed. He could almost see himself standing there, holding a large book about Nanotech, excitedly reading certain passages out loud to a very amused Tony who had of course already read those exact words before. He never said so though, choosing rather to let Peter passionately ramble on and on.</p><p>Tony had always made sure that the main room stayed intact and clean. The real mess that you\u2019d expect from a genius inventor slash engineer like him was hidden away in the lab, a couple of feet down the hallway on Peter\u2019s left. Knowing Tony, he was most probably hidden there as well, buried beneath tons of files, scraps of metal, and coffee. </p><p>Peter walked towards the lab, his heart racing and his fingers quaking a little. He sniffed as his feet walked over a familiar metal plate on the floor and the plate started to turn along with the wall in front of him, swiveling so that he found himself on the other side. And sure enough, before him stood Tony, a wire cutter in his hands and a coffee stain on his t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d the man asked, his expression clouded by confusion as his dark brown eyes swept over his visitor.</p><p>Peter blinked, trying to keep welling tears at bay, and then looked away shamefully.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark,\u201d he answered, his voice quiet and hoarse. </p><p>The air between the two of them was heavy and tense, both trying to figure out what to say. Tony simply stared at Peter, his lips slightly parted as racing thoughts filled his mind. </p><p>Peter was here, standing in front of him. It had been so long. And he looked absolutely terrible, what had she done to him?</p><p>\u201cI-uh\u2026I need your help,\u201d Peter croaked, still refusing to meet Tony\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cOf course, what do you need?\u201d He asked immediately. He hated seeing Peter like this. He was almost unrecognizable. He had truly never looked this tired and hopeless before. </p><p>Peter suddenly lunged forward, grabbing Tony\u2019s shoulders to keep himself up. He was exhausted, so tired of everything. </p><p>Tony, though shocked, wrapped his arms around him and winced at the sound of strangled sobs leaving Peter\u2019s chest. The broken man shook as he gripped Tony\u2019s shirt, his knuckles turning white. He had always been like a father to him, someone he looked up to but more importantly, depended on. For some reason, Tony had always stuck by him, no matter what, even if it meant putting himself at risk. </p><p>He had missed him terribly. </p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Peter sobbed in the crook of Tony\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. You\u2019re okay, kid,\u201d replied Tony, shutting his eyes as he rubbed Peter\u2019s back with his firm hands. </p><p>The pair continued to hug for a few minutes, Peter\u2019s cries eventually calming down. Peter and Tony had only ever hugged once before: it was the day the Avengers had saved him and billions of others around the globe, the day he came back from the void he had been sent to by Thanos and the Infinity stones. Tony, relieved and grateful, had wrapped his arms around the then-teenager and held on so tightly that he had almost broken Peter\u2019s ribs. </p><p>Finally, Peter pulled away and hesitantly wiped at his eyes, inhaling deeply. </p><p>Tony walked over to the little seating area by a spiral staircase in the room. He gestured to one of the leather arm chairs, and Peter took the hint and sat down, his gaze locked onto the floor beneath his humid feet, sniffling a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink? Like, a soda, or water-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter muttered, cutting Tony off.</p><p>Tony nodded as he bit his lip, unsure as to what to say to the young man sitting across from him. He waited patiently for Peter to speak, rubbing circles in the palm of his right hand. He was nervous for some reason. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t called you back,\u201d Peter finally said, still looking down. \u201cI just- didn\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ve had a lot going on,\u201d replied Tony, his voice gentle.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I-uh, I haven\u2019t been sleeping much. I\u2019m not doing well.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded slowly, his expression saddening.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I need you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>This made Tony sit up straighter and clear his throat, curious as to what Peter was going to ask of him. Of course, he\u2019d do anything for him, but besides being a shoulder for him to cry on and a person to talk to every now and then, he didn\u2019t really see what else he could do. </p><p>\u201cI remember coming here a couple of years ago. You had a few projects going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a bunch of prototypes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Peter took in a deep shaky breath. \u201cDo you still have the Memory Card?\u201d</p><p>Tony froze. \u201cThe Memory Card, why would you need the Memory Card?\u201d he asked, startled.</p><p>Peter looked down and his hands started to quake softly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark. I don\u2019t want to remember her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-every time I do anything, I see her. I see what she did and I hear what she said- and it hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, Peter, but, it\u2019s a prototype. And we\u2019re talking about taking months worth of memories from your brain and stocking them in a computer file. Not only is it <i>extremely</i> dangerous, but this is something that requires extensive planning and a lot of thought-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I <i>have</i> been thinking. For months!\u201d Peter raised his voice, anger slowly rising in his abdomen. \u201cYou have no idea. I\u2019ve been torturing myself, every day, trying to move on from her, from those memories. I can\u2019t do it anymore. You have no idea how bad it hurts.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head slowly, his eyes still closed. This kid was insane. It was a dangerous ordeal, one he couldn\u2019t believe they were even discussing. If something went wrong, if there was even the tiniest glitch, Peter could very well lose everything: his memories, his personality, his life. It was dramatic to even think about that, but Tony would in fact be tampering with Peter\u2019s brain. With an untested prototype. Anything could happen. </p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s dangerous. And it probably won\u2019t work. Yeah, maybe all my memories get deleted. Honestly, at this point, I just don\u2019t care anymore. Please, please, Mr. Stark. I don\u2019t want to remember her anymore. I just want to move on, for good.\u201d</p><p>At this point, a fat tear had escaped the confines of Peter\u2019s left eye and slowly rolled down his cheek, landing on his hoodie. He was shaking a little, and his eyes were wide with desperation. </p><p>Tony knew it was a huge gamble, but for Peter, he would roll the dice. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"206\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sumerlynxd:pQNd9OdNRK5-cRxrlWRQcw:ZRdCed2NxuC-9\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5b7c7fbabe6ee37ed59ecf49428a568/tumblr_otapmv3fIK1wsw71qo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"206\"/></figure><p><b>A/N: aaaah, what did you guys think?? are you curious about the memory card? ooh what do you guys think happened with Peter and his ex??\u00a0</b></p><p><b>tagging:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrWzz0SGFqcEi0vOMPjSmNA\">@hellogoodbyebitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOnvHLOcOGJYhLUZLdMvWSQ\">@twilightparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_2sueli_MVmnfEOCBj0wMg\">@writteninthestarsandthesky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-u5fE1FshWQ3iArluFCNdg\">@perlocutionary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpGQpJm8Q94xoExmnA4bcPQ\">@itsbilescallmebiles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5M_ikTSbQzvk4tvEMSbPzA\">@redstringlovers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHz1a-zg4lyn_OHB6XUC-Mg\">@jurrasicpork</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MBG1naS6i0DdXBAyzAbgA\">@brien-odylan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW3efbqow46cI0dAxfX2rw\">@dafine18</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m16rpdPyJG-AAYTsFnPjNvw\">@loverofwaytoomanythings618</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpokMg_sZHMAA6bUKAstgmQ\">@apatheticanvas67482</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHLKI3LQL2ME6VS96qK60Q\">@fullangelimagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1RQoXfen9NottpL9I_8fFw\">@cielosrosas</a>\u00a0</b></p><p><b>also tagging <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEiguZRZmiCoP57LFk81VsQ\">@petalparker</a> &lt;3</b></p><p>(tagging the people in my forever tag list: if you would like to be removed from my forever tag, no offence will be taken)</p><p><b><i>if you want to be added to my Peter Parker tag list or my Forgetting You tag list, please send me an ask and specify which taglist you want to be added to! thank youuu</i></b></p>",

He\u2019d find himself lying on the floor, wiping at his eyes over and over again, wondering how he was still able to cry, how he still had enough energy to do so. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The worst moments were when he\u2019d get up from whatever surface he\u2019d been lying on and go to the fridge, or the bathroom, or the fire escape, or the hall. The fact was, anytime he went anywhere in his little apartment, anytime his bloodshot eyes would fall onto a particular object, be it a magnet, or a toothbrush or the old ashtray outside, and he\u2019d be thrown back into old memories, excruciating memories he had been trying to leave behind for months. </p><p>With one glance, he\u2019d be sent to a time where pain was ignored and replaced by temporary bliss. He had tried, he had worked for so long to make that happiness last, but it hadn\u2019t stuck. When a vase you adore more than anything in the world is broken, you do whatever it takes to repair it, even if it means gluing every little piece of porcelain back together, even if it takes you months to do so. But sometimes, when you try and fix what has been broken, you end up breaking something far more important: yourself. </p><p>Peter had learned that the hard way. And perhaps it was too late, maybe he was unmendable. That would explain why hadn\u2019t stopped hurting ever since she had disappeared from his life. </p><p>It was about half past four in the afternoon. The rain was still pouring onto the streets of New York and because of that, the usual sound of traffic didn\u2019t fill Peter\u2019s ears. In fact, the apartment was dead silent.</p><p>Peter was lying on his stomach on his unmade bed, his head facing the wall in front of him. His arms lay on either sides of his body, motionless as though he couldn\u2019t feel them. He barely blinked as he kept on staring at the light grey wall. His eyes were tired and the huge circles beneath them were proof that he hadn\u2019t slept in a while. </p><p>Then all of a sudden, the sound of the home telephone ringing snapped Peter out of his daze and he pulled his eyes away from the wall, instead turning around slowly to look at the object from across the hall. The cordless phone was resting on a small coffee table right next to the front door. As Peter looked at it, he felt a pang of anger fill his chest and he stood up, calmly. </p><p>Placing one foot in front of the other, he slowly made his way out his bedroom and into the main room. He ignored the area, including his Spiderman mask that had been left forgotten in the corner of the room with a bunch of other mundane objects, his cold gaze still focused on the phone who hadn\u2019t stopped ringing yet. Finally, he reached the front door and with a darkness in his eyes, Peter grabbed the phone and immediately hurtled it at the floor, smashing it to pieces. The ringing stopped instantly, but the sound of the impact echoed in Peter\u2019s mind, the previous silence long forgotten. </p><p>Barely avoiding the pile of phone fragments, the young man walked into his kitchen and stopped in front of his fridge. Sure enough, a memory started seeping back in Peter\u2019s head and he winced as the hurt settled in. </p><p><i>\u201cWe have beer, tomatoes, milk that\u2019s gone bad and what looks like cheese but I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d</i></p><p>Peter shook his head aggressively, trying to block out the memory of her voice, desperately. But in vain. As her words sneakily crept into his mind, Peter violently punched the fridge, yelping as pain erupted in his balled up hand and he stumbled backwards, his back eventually hitting the tiled wall. He slid down and landed on the dusty floor. He hadn\u2019t cleaned up the apartment in weeks. Breathing heavily, Peter buried his face and his hands and started sobbing, the action so strong he shook with every tear. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he couldn\u2019t handle the pain. It was too much. He felt like his insides were being torn apart over and over again. Every time he did anything, he felt sick to his stomach with grief and sadness. He would do anything, anything at all to get rid of it all, to get rid of the feeling he\u2019d get whenever he remembered her face, or her perfume, or the way she talked.

He had always wanted Tony to think he was strong and fearless, but the truth was he was weak. Peter didn\u2019t want to let his hero down, yet throughout every passing minute of his self-inflicted house arrest, he had done just that.</p><p>The doors opening interrupted Peter\u2019s racing thoughts and he took a shaky breath before hesitantly leaving the elevator. </p><p>The main room was just like he remembered it. There were big black leather couches in the center of the room that had been bought by Tony a few months after the Avengers had brought back the victims of Thanos\u2019 attack on the universe, and Peter remembers because he\u2019d helped to pick them out. Glass bookshelves and tables rested in every corner of the room, a large aluminum chandelier hung from the shiny white ceiling, and nothing really had changed. He could almost see himself standing there, holding a large book about Nanotech, excitedly reading certain passages out loud to a very amused Tony who had of course already read those exact words before. He never said so though, choosing rather to let Peter passionately ramble on and on.</p><p>Tony had always made sure that the main room stayed intact and clean. The real mess that you\u2019d expect from a genius inventor slash engineer like him was hidden away in the lab, a couple of feet down the hallway on Peter\u2019s left. Knowing Tony, he was most probably hidden there as well, buried beneath tons of files, scraps of metal, and coffee. </p><p>Peter walked towards the lab, his heart racing and his fingers quaking a little. He sniffed as his feet walked over a familiar metal plate on the floor and the plate started to turn along with the wall in front of him, swiveling so that he found himself on the other side. And sure enough, before him stood Tony, a wire cutter in his hands and a coffee stain on his t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d the man asked, his expression clouded by confusion as his dark brown eyes swept over his visitor.</p><p>Peter blinked, trying to keep welling tears at bay, and then looked away shamefully.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark,\u201d he answered, his voice quiet and hoarse. </p><p>The air between the two of them was heavy and tense, both trying to figure out what to say. Tony simply stared at Peter, his lips slightly parted as racing thoughts filled his mind. </p><p>Peter was here, standing in front of him. It had been so long. And he looked absolutely terrible, what had she done to him?</p><p>\u201cI-uh\u2026I need your help,\u201d Peter croaked, still refusing to meet Tony\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cOf course, what do you need?\u201d He asked immediately. He hated seeing Peter like this. He was almost unrecognizable. He had truly never looked this tired and hopeless before. </p><p>Peter suddenly lunged forward, grabbing Tony\u2019s shoulders to keep himself up. He was exhausted, so tired of everything. </p><p>Tony, though shocked, wrapped his arms around him and winced at the sound of strangled sobs leaving Peter\u2019s chest. The broken man shook as he gripped Tony\u2019s shirt, his knuckles turning white. He had always been like a father to him, someone he looked up to but more importantly, depended on. For some reason, Tony had always stuck by him, no matter what, even if it meant putting himself at risk. </p><p>He had missed him terribly. </p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Peter sobbed in the crook of Tony\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. You\u2019re okay, kid,\u201d replied Tony, shutting his eyes as he rubbed Peter\u2019s back with his firm hands. </p><p>The pair continued to hug for a few minutes, Peter\u2019s cries eventually calming down. Peter and Tony had only ever hugged once before: it was the day the Avengers had saved him and billions of others around the globe, the day he came back from the void he had been sent to by Thanos and the Infinity stones. Tony, relieved and grateful, had wrapped his arms around the then-teenager and held on so tightly that he had almost broken Peter\u2019s ribs. </p><p>Finally, Peter pulled away and hesitantly wiped at his eyes, inhaling deeply. </p><p>Tony walked over to the little seating area by a spiral staircase in the room. He gestured to one of the leather arm chairs, and Peter took the hint and sat down, his gaze locked onto the floor beneath his humid feet, sniffling a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink? Like, a soda, or water-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter muttered, cutting Tony off.</p><p>Tony nodded as he bit his lip, unsure as to what to say to the young man sitting across from him. He waited patiently for Peter to speak, rubbing circles in the palm of his right hand. He was nervous for some reason. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t called you back,\u201d Peter finally said, still looking down. \u201cI just- didn\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ve had a lot going on,\u201d replied Tony, his voice gentle.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I-uh, I haven\u2019t been sleeping much. I\u2019m not doing well.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded slowly, his expression saddening.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I need you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>This made Tony sit up straighter and clear his throat, curious as to what Peter was going to ask of him. Of course, he\u2019d do anything for him, but besides being a shoulder for him to cry on and a person to talk to every now and then, he didn\u2019t really see what else he could do. </p><p>\u201cI remember coming here a couple of years ago. You had a few projects going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a bunch of prototypes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Peter took in a deep shaky breath. \u201cDo you still have the Memory Card?\u201d</p><p>Tony froze. \u201cThe Memory Card, why would you need the Memory Card?\u201d he asked, startled.</p><p>Peter looked down and his hands started to quake softly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark. I don\u2019t want to remember her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-every time I do anything, I see her. I see what she did and I hear what she said- and it hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, Peter, but, it\u2019s a prototype. And we\u2019re talking about taking months worth of memories from your brain and stocking them in a computer file. Not only is it <i>extremely</i> dangerous, but this is something that requires extensive planning and a lot of thought-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I <i>have</i> been thinking. For months!\u201d Peter raised his voice, anger slowly rising in his abdomen. \u201cYou have no idea. I\u2019ve been torturing myself, every day, trying to move on from her, from those memories. I can\u2019t do it anymore. You have no idea how bad it hurts.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head slowly, his eyes still closed. This kid was insane. It was a dangerous ordeal, one he couldn\u2019t believe they were even discussing. If something went wrong, if there was even the tiniest glitch, Peter could very well lose everything: his memories, his personality, his life. It was dramatic to even think about that, but Tony would in fact be tampering with Peter\u2019s brain. With an untested prototype. Anything could happen. </p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s dangerous. And it probably won\u2019t work. Yeah, maybe all my memories get deleted. Honestly, at this point, I just don\u2019t care anymore. Please, please, Mr. Stark. I don\u2019t want to remember her anymore. I just want to move on, for good.\u201d</p><p>At this point, a fat tear had escaped the confines of Peter\u2019s left eye and slowly rolled down his cheek, landing on his hoodie. He was shaking a little, and his eyes were wide with desperation. </p><p>Tony knew it was a huge gamble, but for Peter, he would roll the dice. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"206\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sumerlynxd:pQNd9OdNRK5-cRxrlWRQcw:ZRdCed2NxuC-9\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5b7c7fbabe6ee37ed59ecf49428a568/tumblr_otapmv3fIK1wsw71qo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"206\"></figure><p><b>A/N: aaaah, what did you guys think?? are you curious about the memory card? ooh what do you guys think happened with Peter and his ex??\u00a0</b></p><p><b>tagging:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrWzz0SGFqcEi0vOMPjSmNA\">@hellogoodbyebitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOnvHLOcOGJYhLUZLdMvWSQ\">@twilightparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_2sueli_MVmnfEOCBj0wMg\">@writteninthestarsandthesky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-u5fE1FshWQ3iArluFCNdg\">@perlocutionary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpGQpJm8Q94xoExmnA4bcPQ\">@itsbilescallmebiles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5M_ikTSbQzvk4tvEMSbPzA\">@redstringlovers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHz1a-zg4lyn_OHB6XUC-Mg\">@jurrasicpork</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MBG1naS6i0DdXBAyzAbgA\">@brien-odylan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW3efbqow46cI0dAxfX2rw\">@dafine18</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m16rpdPyJG-AAYTsFnPjNvw\">@loverofwaytoomanythings618</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpokMg_sZHMAA6bUKAstgmQ\">@apatheticanvas67482</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHLKI3LQL2ME6VS96qK60Q\">@fullangelimagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1RQoXfen9NottpL9I_8fFw\">@cielosrosas</a>\u00a0</b></p><p><b>also tagging <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEiguZRZmiCoP57LFk81VsQ\">@petalparker</a> &lt;3</b></p><p>(tagging the people in my forever tag list: if you would like to be removed from my forever tag, no offence will be taken)</p><p><b><i>if you want to be added to my Peter Parker tag list or my Forgetting You tag list, please send me an ask and specify which taglist you want to be added to! thank youuu</i></b></p>",

In fact, it was rainy all the time. It wasn\u2019t heavy rain, but if you listened closely enough, you could definitely hear the sound of raindrops tap-tapping against the windows of the apartment. Where there is rain, there are clouds, and sure enough, the dome above the skyscrapers of New York was grey and cool. You often hear of people whose moods eventually match the weather outside, but you never hear the opposite. One\u2019s happiness does not mean the sun will come out and make everyone feel warm. Yet somehow, with Peter\u2019s broken heart came the storms outside his apartment in Queens. It was as though the sky had heard him sob in the night and had started to cry with him, accompanying him throughout his lonely journey to recovery.<b><br></b></p><p>Recovery was far from being achieved. Peter had been holed up in his home for months, refusing to speak to anyone, refusing to face the city and it\u2019s problems. Peter couldn\u2019t do anything - not even breathe before the urge to throw up or start sobbing uncontrollably emerged; he was a mess. He felt empty, yet his tears never ceased. He\u2019d find himself lying on the floor, wiping at his eyes over and over again, wondering how he was still able to cry, how he still had enough energy to do so. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The worst moments were when he\u2019d get up from whatever surface he\u2019d been lying on and go to the fridge, or the bathroom, or the fire escape, or the hall. The fact was, anytime he went anywhere in his little apartment, anytime his bloodshot eyes would fall onto a particular object, be it a magnet, or a toothbrush or the old ashtray outside, and he\u2019d be thrown back into old memories, excruciating memories he had been trying to leave behind for months. </p><p>With one glance, he\u2019d be sent to a time where pain was ignored and replaced by temporary bliss. He had tried, he had worked for so long to make that happiness last, but it hadn\u2019t stuck. When a vase you adore more than anything in the world is broken, you do whatever it takes to repair it, even if it means gluing every little piece of porcelain back together, even if it takes you months to do so. But sometimes, when you try and fix what has been broken, you end up breaking something far more important: yourself. </p><p>Peter had learned that the hard way. And perhaps it was too late, maybe he was unmendable. That would explain why hadn\u2019t stopped hurting ever since she had disappeared from his life. </p><p>It was about half past four in the afternoon. The rain was still pouring onto the streets of New York and because of that, the usual sound of traffic didn\u2019t fill Peter\u2019s ears. In fact, the apartment was dead silent.</p><p>Peter was lying on his stomach on his unmade bed, his head facing the wall in front of him. His arms lay on either sides of his body, motionless as though he couldn\u2019t feel them. He barely blinked as he kept on staring at the light grey wall. His eyes were tired and the huge circles beneath them were proof that he hadn\u2019t slept in a while. </p><p>Then all of a sudden, the sound of the home telephone ringing snapped Peter out of his daze and he pulled his eyes away from the wall, instead turning around slowly to look at the object from across the hall. The cordless phone was resting on a small coffee table right next to the front door. As Peter looked at it, he felt a pang of anger fill his chest and he stood up, calmly. </p><p>Placing one foot in front of the other, he slowly made his way out his bedroom and into the main room. He ignored the area, including his Spiderman mask that had been left forgotten in the corner of the room with a bunch of other mundane objects, his cold gaze still focused on the phone who hadn\u2019t stopped ringing yet. Finally, he reached the front door and with a darkness in his eyes, Peter grabbed the phone and immediately hurtled it at the floor, smashing it to pieces. The ringing stopped instantly, but the sound of the impact echoed in Peter\u2019s mind, the previous silence long forgotten. </p><p>Barely avoiding the pile of phone fragments, the young man walked into his kitchen and stopped in front of his fridge. Sure enough, a memory started seeping back in Peter\u2019s head and he winced as the hurt settled in. </p><p><i>\u201cWe have beer, tomatoes, milk that\u2019s gone bad and what looks like cheese but I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d</i></p><p>Peter shook his head aggressively, trying to block out the memory of her voice, desperately. But in vain. As her words sneakily crept into his mind, Peter violently punched the fridge, yelping as pain erupted in his balled up hand and he stumbled backwards, his back eventually hitting the tiled wall. He slid down and landed on the dusty floor. He hadn\u2019t cleaned up the apartment in weeks. Breathing heavily, Peter buried his face and his hands and started sobbing, the action so strong he shook with every tear. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he couldn\u2019t handle the pain. It was too much. He felt like his insides were being torn apart over and over again. Every time he did anything, he felt sick to his stomach with grief and sadness. He would do anything, anything at all to get rid of it all, to get rid of the feeling he\u2019d get whenever he remembered her face, or her perfume, or the way she talked. He was desperate. </p><p>Then suddenly, he lifted his head, fat tears still rolling down his flushed cheeks. </p><p>The reason why he couldn\u2019t get over what had happened to him was because every little thing was still engraved in his mind, and evidence was displayed everywhere around his apartment. Everywhere he looked, she was there, along with her remains. So in order for him to move on, maybe all he needed to do was forget. Forget the girl, forget the pain, and live. After so many months of sadness and misery, maybe he\u2019d be able to achieve the recovery he\u2019d been trying so hard to reach. </p><p>But he would have to forget everything, every single detail of the past year and a half that concerned the subject of his nightmares. How does one forget so much?</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, with the help of a certain Tony Stark. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tonydaily:P7l-C35bbf4YCGAg0XppFA:ZdevyX2fJEB8m\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b95792a12b2cd9c21f23af6425c5fa8/tumblr_pkxlr392B21y08szqo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"223\"></figure><p>After changing into some clean clothes, Peter took a cab and about an hour later, he arrived at the Avengers Facility. Peter hoarsely thanked the cab driver before turning around. His eyes rested on the large A that decorated the imposing building, the A he had once proudly considered himself a part of. He hadn\u2019t come here in months.</p><p>Peter started walking towards the building, his feet occasionally walking into small puddles, but he didn\u2019t care about that nor did he care about the rain pouring down on him. He had to find Tony.</p><p>Inside the facility, warm air enveloped Peter\u2019s humid body. He had missed this place, he realised. He\u2019d missed the glass doors and tall concrete walls, and that feeling he got whenever he walked through those main doors. That feeling of responsibility. </p><p>It had been a while, but the only difference between now and then was that now he wasn\u2019t here because of his responsibility. It wasn\u2019t like before, and that fact made him feel even worse.</p><p>The main hall was empty, no one was there. Peter didn\u2019t dwell on it and walked in the direction of the elevators, moving fast when he suddenly heard his name being called. He halted and hesitantly, he turned around, his eyes resting on Natasha. </p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d she asked, eyes wide in shock. She hadn\u2019t seen him in so long, no one had.</p><p>At the sight of his old friend and teammate, Peter\u2019s eyes welled up and for a minute Natasha could have sworn he was going to come over there and hug her, but he didn\u2019t. Instead he shook his head, wiping away his fresh tears as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI have to see Mr. Stark,\u201d he said, his voice wobbly and breaking mid-sentence. </p><p>Without saying anything else, Peter turned his back on Natasha and pressed the elevator button. The doors opened and he entered swiftly, trying to get away from the blonde woman he missed dearly. If he couldn\u2019t face her, how could he face Mr. Stark? No, he couldn\u2019t try and back out now. He needed Tony.</p><p>Peter nodded with resolve and pushed his fears and troubling thoughts from his mind. Or at least he tried to.</p><p>As the elevator went further up, Peter\u2019s heart started beating faster and faster, his breath shortening. His hands were moist and not because of the rain that had greeted him outside. He was nervous, in fact he was terrified. He hadn\u2019t talked to Tony in so long, too long. The truth was, he had been ashamed of himself. Ashamed of his behavior during the past few months, ashamed of his emotional turmoil. He had always wanted Tony to think he was strong and fearless, but the truth was he was weak. Peter didn\u2019t want to let his hero down, yet throughout every passing minute of his self-inflicted house arrest, he had done just that.</p><p>The doors opening interrupted Peter\u2019s racing thoughts and he took a shaky breath before hesitantly leaving the elevator. </p><p>The main room was just like he remembered it. There were big black leather couches in the center of the room that had been bought by Tony a few months after the Avengers had brought back the victims of Thanos\u2019 attack on the universe, and Peter remembers because he\u2019d helped to pick them out. Glass bookshelves and tables rested in every corner of the room, a large aluminum chandelier hung from the shiny white ceiling, and nothing really had changed. He could almost see himself standing there, holding a large book about Nanotech, excitedly reading certain passages out loud to a very amused Tony who had of course already read those exact words before. He never said so though, choosing rather to let Peter passionately ramble on and on.</p><p>Tony had always made sure that the main room stayed intact and clean. The real mess that you\u2019d expect from a genius inventor slash engineer like him was hidden away in the lab, a couple of feet down the hallway on Peter\u2019s left. Knowing Tony, he was most probably hidden there as well, buried beneath tons of files, scraps of metal, and coffee. </p><p>Peter walked towards the lab, his heart racing and his fingers quaking a little. He sniffed as his feet walked over a familiar metal plate on the floor and the plate started to turn along with the wall in front of him, swiveling so that he found himself on the other side. And sure enough, before him stood Tony, a wire cutter in his hands and a coffee stain on his t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d the man asked, his expression clouded by confusion as his dark brown eyes swept over his visitor.</p><p>Peter blinked, trying to keep welling tears at bay, and then looked away shamefully.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark,\u201d he answered, his voice quiet and hoarse. </p><p>The air between the two of them was heavy and tense, both trying to figure out what to say. Tony simply stared at Peter, his lips slightly parted as racing thoughts filled his mind. </p><p>Peter was here, standing in front of him. It had been so long. And he looked absolutely terrible, what had she done to him?</p><p>\u201cI-uh\u2026I need your help,\u201d Peter croaked, still refusing to meet Tony\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cOf course, what do you need?\u201d He asked immediately. He hated seeing Peter like this. He was almost unrecognizable. He had truly never looked this tired and hopeless before. </p><p>Peter suddenly lunged forward, grabbing Tony\u2019s shoulders to keep himself up. He was exhausted, so tired of everything. </p><p>Tony, though shocked, wrapped his arms around him and winced at the sound of strangled sobs leaving Peter\u2019s chest. The broken man shook as he gripped Tony\u2019s shirt, his knuckles turning white. He had always been like a father to him, someone he looked up to but more importantly, depended on. For some reason, Tony had always stuck by him, no matter what, even if it meant putting himself at risk. </p><p>He had missed him terribly. </p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Peter sobbed in the crook of Tony\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. You\u2019re okay, kid,\u201d replied Tony, shutting his eyes as he rubbed Peter\u2019s back with his firm hands. </p><p>The pair continued to hug for a few minutes, Peter\u2019s cries eventually calming down. Peter and Tony had only ever hugged once before: it was the day the Avengers had saved him and billions of others around the globe, the day he came back from the void he had been sent to by Thanos and the Infinity stones. Tony, relieved and grateful, had wrapped his arms around the then-teenager and held on so tightly that he had almost broken Peter\u2019s ribs. </p><p>Finally, Peter pulled away and hesitantly wiped at his eyes, inhaling deeply. </p><p>Tony walked over to the little seating area by a spiral staircase in the room. He gestured to one of the leather arm chairs, and Peter took the hint and sat down, his gaze locked onto the floor beneath his humid feet, sniffling a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something to drink? Like, a soda, or water-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter muttered, cutting Tony off.</p><p>Tony nodded as he bit his lip, unsure as to what to say to the young man sitting across from him. He waited patiently for Peter to speak, rubbing circles in the palm of his right hand. He was nervous for some reason. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t called you back,\u201d Peter finally said, still looking down. \u201cI just- didn\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ve had a lot going on,\u201d replied Tony, his voice gentle.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I-uh, I haven\u2019t been sleeping much. I\u2019m not doing well.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded slowly, his expression saddening.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, I need you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>This made Tony sit up straighter and clear his throat, curious as to what Peter was going to ask of him. Of course, he\u2019d do anything for him, but besides being a shoulder for him to cry on and a person to talk to every now and then, he didn\u2019t really see what else he could do. </p><p>\u201cI remember coming here a couple of years ago. You had a few projects going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a bunch of prototypes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Peter took in a deep shaky breath. \u201cDo you still have the Memory Card?\u201d</p><p>Tony froze. \u201cThe Memory Card, why would you need the Memory Card?\u201d he asked, startled.</p><p>Peter looked down and his hands started to quake softly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark. I don\u2019t want to remember her anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-every time I do anything, I see her. I see what she did and I hear what she said- and it hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, Peter, but, it\u2019s a prototype. And we\u2019re talking about taking months worth of memories from your brain and stocking them in a computer file. Not only is it <i>extremely</i> dangerous, but this is something that requires extensive planning and a lot of thought-,\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I <i>have</i> been thinking. For months!\u201d Peter raised his voice, anger slowly rising in his abdomen. \u201cYou have no idea. I\u2019ve been torturing myself, every day, trying to move on from her, from those memories. I can\u2019t do it anymore. You have no idea how bad it hurts.\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head slowly, his eyes still closed. This kid was insane. It was a dangerous ordeal, one he couldn\u2019t believe they were even discussing. If something went wrong, if there was even the tiniest glitch, Peter could very well lose everything: his memories, his personality, his life. It was dramatic to even think about that, but Tony would in fact be tampering with Peter\u2019s brain. With an untested prototype. Anything could happen. </p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s dangerous. And it probably won\u2019t work. Yeah, maybe all my memories get deleted. Honestly, at this point, I just don\u2019t care anymore. Please, please, Mr. Stark. I don\u2019t want to remember her anymore. I just want to move on, for good.\u201d</p><p>At this point, a fat tear had escaped the confines of Peter\u2019s left eye and slowly rolled down his cheek, landing on his hoodie. He was shaking a little, and his eyes were wide with desperation. </p><p>Tony knew it was a huge gamble, but for Peter, he would roll the dice. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"206\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sumerlynxd:pQNd9OdNRK5-cRxrlWRQcw:ZRdCed2NxuC-9\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5b7c7fbabe6ee37ed59ecf49428a568/tumblr_otapmv3fIK1wsw71qo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"206\"></figure><p><b>A/N: aaaah, what did you guys think?? are you curious about the memory card? ooh what do you guys think happened with Peter and his ex??\u00a0</b></p><p><b>tagging:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrWzz0SGFqcEi0vOMPjSmNA\">@hellogoodbyebitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOnvHLOcOGJYhLUZLdMvWSQ\">@twilightparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_2sueli_MVmnfEOCBj0wMg\">@writteninthestarsandthesky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-u5fE1FshWQ3iArluFCNdg\">@perlocutionary</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpGQpJm8Q94xoExmnA4bcPQ\">@itsbilescallmebiles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5M_ikTSbQzvk4tvEMSbPzA\">@redstringlovers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHz1a-zg4lyn_OHB6XUC-Mg\">@jurrasicpork</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MBG1naS6i0DdXBAyzAbgA\">@brien-odylan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW3efbqow46cI0dAxfX2rw\">@dafine18</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m16rpdPyJG-AAYTsFnPjNvw\">@loverofwaytoomanythings618</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpokMg_sZHMAA6bUKAstgmQ\">@apatheticanvas67482</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHLKI3LQL2ME6VS96qK60Q\">@fullangelimagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1RQoXfen9NottpL9I_8fFw\">@cielosrosas</a>\u00a0</b></p><p><b>also tagging <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEiguZRZmiCoP57LFk81VsQ\">@petalparker</a> &lt;3</b></p><p>(tagging the people in my forever tag list: if you would like to be removed from my forever tag, no offence will be taken)</p><p><b><i>if you want to be added to my Peter Parker tag list or my Forgetting You tag list, please send me an ask and specify which taglist you want to be added to! thank youuu</i></b></p>",

In fact, it was rainy all the time. It wasn&rsquo;t heavy rain, but if you listened closely enough, you could definitely hear the sound of raindrops tap-tapping against the windows of the apartment. Where there is rain, there are clouds, and sure enough, the dome above the skyscrapers of New York was grey and cool. You often hear of people whose moods eventually match the weather outside, but you never hear the opposite. One&rsquo;s happiness does not mean the sun will come out and make everyone feel warm. Yet somehow, with Peter&rsquo;s broken heart came the storms outside his apartment in Queens. It was as though the sky had heard him sob in the night and had started to cry with him, accompanying him throughout his lonely journey to recovery.<b><br /></b></p><p>Recovery was far from being achieved. Peter had been holed up in his home for months, refusing to speak to anyone, refusing to face the city and it&rsquo;s problems. Peter couldn&rsquo;t do anything - not even breathe before the urge to throw up or start sobbing uncontrollably emerged; he was a mess. He felt empty, yet his tears never ceased. He&rsquo;d find himself lying on the floor, wiping at his eyes over and over again, wondering how he was still able to cry, how he still had enough energy to do so. </p><p>The worst moments were when he&rsquo;d get up from whatever surface he&rsquo;d been lying on and go to the fridge, or the bathroom, or the fire escape, or the hall. The fact was, anytime he went anywhere in his little apartment, anytime his bloodshot eyes would fall onto a particular object, be it a magnet, or a toothbrush or the old ashtray outside, and he&rsquo;d be thrown back into old memories, excruciating memories he had been trying to leave behind for months. </p><p>With one glance, he&rsquo;d be sent to a time where pain was ignored and replaced by temporary bliss. He had tried, he had worked for so long to make that happiness last, but it hadn&rsquo;t stuck. When a vase you adore more than anything in the world is broken, you do whatever it takes to repair it, even if it means gluing every little piece of porcelain back together, even if it takes you months to do so. But sometimes, when you try and fix what has been broken, you end up breaking something far more important: yourself. </p><p>Peter had learned that the hard way. And perhaps it was too late, maybe he was unmendable. That would explain why hadn&rsquo;t stopped hurting ever since she had disappeared from his life. </p><p>It was about half past four in the afternoon. The rain was still pouring onto the streets of New York and because of that, the usual sound of traffic didn&rsquo;t fill Peter&rsquo;s ears. In fact, the apartment was dead silent.</p><p>Peter was lying on his stomach on his unmade bed, his head facing the wall in front of him. His arms lay on either sides of his body, motionless as though he couldn&rsquo;t feel them. He barely blinked as he kept on staring at the light grey wall. His eyes were tired and the huge circles beneath them were proof that he hadn&rsquo;t slept in a while. </p><p>Then all of a sudden, the sound of the home telephone ringing snapped Peter out of his daze and he pulled his eyes away from the wall, instead turning around slowly to look at the object from across the hall. The cordless phone was resting on a small coffee table right next to the front door. As Peter looked at it, he felt a pang of anger fill his chest and he stood up, calmly. </p><p>Placing one foot in front of the other, he slowly made his way out his bedroom and into the main room. He ignored the area, including his Spiderman mask that had been left forgotten in the corner of the room with a bunch of other mundane objects, his cold gaze still focused on the phone who hadn&rsquo;t stopped ringing yet. Finally, he reached the front door and with a darkness in his eyes, Peter grabbed the phone and immediately hurtled it at the floor, smashing it to pieces. The ringing stopped instantly, but the sound of the impact echoed in Peter&rsquo;s mind, the previous silence long forgotten. </p><p>Barely avoiding the pile of phone fragments, the young man walked into his kitchen and stopped in front of his fridge. Sure enough, a memory started seeping back in Peter&rsquo;s head and he winced as the hurt settled in. </p><p><i>&ldquo;We have beer, tomatoes, milk that&rsquo;s gone bad and what looks like cheese but I can&rsquo;t be sure.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Peter shook his head aggressively, trying to block out the memory of her voice, desperately. But in vain. As her words sneakily crept into his mind, Peter violently punched the fridge, yelping as pain erupted in his balled up hand and he stumbled backwards, his back eventually hitting the tiled wall. He slid down and landed on the dusty floor. He hadn&rsquo;t cleaned up the apartment in weeks. Breathing heavily, Peter buried his face and his hands and started sobbing, the action so strong he shook with every tear. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, he couldn&rsquo;t handle the pain. It was too much. He felt like his insides were being torn apart over and over again. Every time he did anything, he felt sick to his stomach with grief and sadness. He would do anything, anything at all to get rid of it all, to get rid of the feeling he&rsquo;d get whenever he remembered her face, or her perfume, or the way she talked. He was desperate. </p><p>Then suddenly, he lifted his head, fat tears still rolling down his flushed cheeks. </p><p>The reason why he couldn&rsquo;t get over what had happened to him was because every little thing was still engraved in his mind, and evidence was displayed everywhere around his apartment. Everywhere he looked, she was there, along with her remains. So in order for him to move on, maybe all he needed to do was forget. Forget the girl, forget the pain, and live. After so many months of sadness and misery, maybe he&rsquo;d be able to achieve the recovery he&rsquo;d been trying so hard to reach. </p><p>But he would have to forget everything, every single detail of the past year and a half that concerned the subject of his nightmares. How does one forget so much?</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, with the help of a certain Tony Stark. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>After changing into some clean clothes, Peter took a cab and about an hour later, he arrived at the Avengers Facility. Peter hoarsely thanked the cab driver before turning around. His eyes rested on the large A that decorated the imposing building, the A he had once proudly considered himself a part of. He hadn&rsquo;t come here in months.</p><p>Peter started walking towards the building, his feet occasionally walking into small puddles, but he didn&rsquo;t care about that nor did he care about the rain pouring down on him. He had to find Tony.</p><p>Inside the facility, warm air enveloped Peter&rsquo;s humid body. He had missed this place, he realised. He&rsquo;d missed the glass doors and tall concrete walls, and that feeling he got whenever he walked through those main doors. That feeling of responsibility. </p><p>It had been a while, but the only difference between now and then was that now he wasn&rsquo;t here because of his responsibility. It wasn&rsquo;t like before, and that fact made him feel even worse.</p><p>The main hall was empty, no one was there. Peter didn&rsquo;t dwell on it and walked in the direction of the elevators, moving fast when he suddenly heard his name being called. He halted and hesitantly, he turned around, his eyes resting on Natasha. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; she asked, eyes wide in shock. She hadn&rsquo;t seen him in so long, no one had.</p><p>At the sight of his old friend and teammate, Peter&rsquo;s eyes welled up and for a minute Natasha could have sworn he was going to come over there and hug her, but he didn&rsquo;t. Instead he shook his head, wiping away his fresh tears as he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to see Mr. Stark,&rdquo; he said, his voice wobbly and breaking mid-sentence. </p><p>Without saying anything else, Peter turned his back on Natasha and pressed the elevator button. The doors opened and he entered swiftly, trying to get away from the blonde woman he missed dearly. If he couldn&rsquo;t face her, how could he face Mr. Stark? No, he couldn&rsquo;t try and back out now. He needed Tony.</p><p>Peter nodded with resolve and pushed his fears and troubling thoughts from his mind. Or at least he tried to.</p><p>As the elevator went further up, Peter&rsquo;s heart started beating faster and faster, his breath shortening. His hands were moist and not because of the rain that had greeted him outside. He was nervous, in fact he was terrified. He hadn&rsquo;t talked to Tony in so long, too long. The truth was, he had been ashamed of himself. Ashamed of his behavior during the past few months, ashamed of his emotional turmoil. He had always wanted Tony to think he was strong and fearless, but the truth was he was weak. Peter didn&rsquo;t want to let his hero down, yet throughout every passing minute of his self-inflicted house arrest, he had done just that.</p><p>The doors opening interrupted Peter&rsquo;s racing thoughts and he took a shaky breath before hesitantly leaving the elevator. </p><p>The main room was just like he remembered it. There were big black leather couches in the center of the room that had been bought by Tony a few months after the Avengers had brought back the victims of Thanos&rsquo; attack on the universe, and Peter remembers because he&rsquo;d helped to pick them out. Glass bookshelves and tables rested in every corner of the room, a large aluminum chandelier hung from the shiny white ceiling, and nothing really had changed. He could almost see himself standing there, holding a large book about Nanotech, excitedly reading certain passages out loud to a very amused Tony who had of course already read those exact words before. He never said so though, choosing rather to let Peter passionately ramble on and on.</p><p>Tony had always made sure that the main room stayed intact and clean. The real mess that you&rsquo;d expect from a genius inventor slash engineer like him was hidden away in the lab, a couple of feet down the hallway on Peter&rsquo;s left. Knowing Tony, he was most probably hidden there as well, buried beneath tons of files, scraps of metal, and coffee. </p><p>Peter walked towards the lab, his heart racing and his fingers quaking a little. He sniffed as his feet walked over a familiar metal plate on the floor and the plate started to turn along with the wall in front of him, swiveling so that he found himself on the other side. And sure enough, before him stood Tony, a wire cutter in his hands and a coffee stain on his t-shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; the man asked, his expression clouded by confusion as his dark brown eyes swept over his visitor.</p><p>Peter blinked, trying to keep welling tears at bay, and then looked away shamefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; he answered, his voice quiet and hoarse. </p><p>The air between the two of them was heavy and tense, both trying to figure out what to say. Tony simply stared at Peter, his lips slightly parted as racing thoughts filled his mind. </p><p>Peter was here, standing in front of him. It had been so long. And he looked absolutely terrible, what had she done to him?</p><p>&ldquo;I-uh&hellip;I need your help,&rdquo; Peter croaked, still refusing to meet Tony&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, what do you need?&rdquo; He asked immediately. He hated seeing Peter like this. He was almost unrecognizable. He had truly never looked this tired and hopeless before. </p><p>Peter suddenly lunged forward, grabbing Tony&rsquo;s shoulders to keep himself up. He was exhausted, so tired of everything. </p><p>Tony, though shocked, wrapped his arms around him and winced at the sound of strangled sobs leaving Peter&rsquo;s chest. The broken man shook as he gripped Tony&rsquo;s shirt, his knuckles turning white. He had always been like a father to him, someone he looked up to but more importantly, depended on. For some reason, Tony had always stuck by him, no matter what, even if it meant putting himself at risk. </p><p>He had missed him terribly. </p><p>&ldquo;I need your help,&rdquo; Peter sobbed in the crook of Tony&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. You&rsquo;re okay, kid,&rdquo; replied Tony, shutting his eyes as he rubbed Peter&rsquo;s back with his firm hands. </p><p>The pair continued to hug for a few minutes, Peter&rsquo;s cries eventually calming down. Peter and Tony had only ever hugged once before: it was the day the Avengers had saved him and billions of others around the globe, the day he came back from the void he had been sent to by Thanos and the Infinity stones. Tony, relieved and grateful, had wrapped his arms around the then-teenager and held on so tightly that he had almost broken Peter&rsquo;s ribs. </p><p>Finally, Peter pulled away and hesitantly wiped at his eyes, inhaling deeply. </p><p>Tony walked over to the little seating area by a spiral staircase in the room.

He was nervous for some reason. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t called you back,&rdquo; Peter finally said, still looking down. &ldquo;I just- didn&rsquo;t really know what to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.
