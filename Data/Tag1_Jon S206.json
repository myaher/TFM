Will Sansa show Cersei what she has leaned from her?)</p><p>- <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">continue plot lines from former seasons</span> because that was one of the things that made Game of Thrones special (Will Arya kill Melisandre (Mel said they will meet again)?; will it be mentioned that Arya &bdquo;would be Gendry&lsquo;s lady&ldquo;?; will Euron get the golden company?; will he meet the second sons?; will they be loyal to Dany or change sides?)</p><p>- <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">good character</span> developments (how will Cersei interact now that Jamie left her?; what does the Night King want?; Will Arya become more sensitive?; Is Jamie now fully over Cersei?)</p><p>-<span class=\"npf_color_joey\"> long battles</span>: there are at least 2 battles (White Walker battle and Cersei battle) and each will definitely be an episode long.</p><p>There might even be on against Euron or the battles are longer so you only have a maximum of 4 episodes left to create a reasonable Dark!Dany plotline while also including everything above. And yes I say reasonable because season 7 did NOT end with Dany burning people, it ended with her agreeing to destroy the Night King, traveling North to save Westeros, crying over Viserion and talking to Jon about her doubts (deserving the thrones).</p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">As a conclusion: It ended with her being madly in love with Jon.</span></p><p>Why is this important?</p><p>Because the only reason why Dany would turn AGAINST Jon is Jon&lsquo;s heritage and his claim to the throne. </p><p>Let&lsquo;s assume Bran tells Jon his herritage in <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">episode one.</span></p><p>Dany will find out about this in <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">episode 2.</span></p><p>You now have only <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">three</span> episodes to give us another battle between Jon and Dany. Let&rsquo;s assume Jon wins this (although his army is way weaker than Dany&lsquo;s (and she has two dragons)).</p><p>Jon would have obviously lost a lot of soldiers during that. How the hell is he now able to fight the White Walkers? Even if one dragon survived and is bound to Jon, he has no chance winning against the Night King. And there is also Cersei. She would never agree fighting for the North. </p><p>And during that you still have to answer a lot of questions, develope characters and give them dialogue which does not inclued starring each other to death on the battlefield. </p><p>You can obviously also have Jon and Dany fight at the end of the season as an &bdquo;epic showdown&ldquo;. But to defeat the WW and Cersei Jon needs Dany&lsquo;s help. I mean, he can also kill her and then expect her army to follow him. Which is super realistic. But to get back to the point, the season won&lsquo;t start with the WW and Cersei battle. There have to be at least 2 or 3 episodes before the first battle and than one episode between the first and the second battle. So now we only have one episode to turn them against each other and make it believable&hellip;.</p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">Instead of creating this mess</span>, the better version would be that with the reveal of Jon&lsquo;s true family Daenerys realizes that the throne she always believed she wanted is a metaphore for a family and a home. She always wanted a place where she belonged. The quote from season 7 in Dragonstone &bdquo;<span class=\"npf_color_joey\">this does not feel like home</span>&ldquo; is a proof for that.</p><p>She always thought her home is on Dragonstone. But she was wrong. Now she thinks if she is queen and in KL it would feel right. But I think everyone knows that this is not true. </p><p>And that&rsquo;s what Daenerys needs to realize. </p><p>Besides, Jon already bent the knee to Daenerys as her queen (which makes his claim to the throne non existing). Him betraying her and demanding the throne is simply against his character.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all for today. I thought this needs to be said. I hope you feel better jonerys fam :)</p></p>",

He should be chuckling like a teenage boy but he couldn&rsquo;t shake out the feeling, like lead had settled in his gut, when he remembered the look on her face after he drew a dick in the middle of a half-made reject of a painting he found in her room. He had to scrub a portion of the painting off with thinner so he could make space for his own art. He thinks he did more than okay. </p><p>But something about the way she stiffened and the thinning of her lips told him that it was something different. Too caught up in his own childish antics, he didn&rsquo;t really take note of it until now. He thought they were still in the middle of pissing each other off in the World&rsquo;s Worst\u2122 Break-Up, both refusing to move out of the apartment they both bought, but something like guilt was niggling at him. </p><p>They weren&rsquo;t always like this, Jon thought. Their relationship started out slow, a budding attraction that began to build upon a tentative sort of friendship. Yet somehow, they managed to bring out the worst in each other now. Sansa, whether intentional or not, always managed to make Jon feel like he&rsquo;s disappointed her. And he doesn&rsquo;t even know what he did. When this happens, Jon becomes too sullen and pushes her away. </p><p>Until he pushed too hard and she finally called it quits on them. </p><p>The funny thing is, Jon thinks, he&rsquo;s still very much in love with her. He&rsquo;s just god awful at words. But this thing that they have now? That&rsquo;s all he can cling to because at least it&rsquo;s still something with Sansa. Even if it is fucked up. </p><p>Before he reaches the apartment, he sees Jeyne and Arya talking inside both with boxes in their hands. </p><p>\u201cDid you get all her clothes?\u201d Jeyne asks her sister-in-law as she puts more of Sansa&rsquo;s things in boxes. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I got all of them,\u201d Arya responds distractedly. \u201cWhat she needs 5 pieces of the same black dress for I\u2019ll never - \u201d she stops mid grumbling when she spots him loitering by the door. </p><p>Jon has seen Arya stare at another human being coldly. She acted the wildest of the Starks with a protective streak to match and Jon has seen that look targeted at many of the creeps who dared to hassle her sister. </p><p>He just never expected to be at the receiving end of it, getting along as quickly as they did.</p><p>And Jon knew then that whatever he did to Sansa last night was enough for her to unleash Arya&rsquo;s barely reigned in wrath on him. </p><p>He was about to open his mouth to apologize, even if he wasn&rsquo;t really sure what he was apologizing for when she cuts him before uttering a sound. </p><p>\u201cHer keys are on the table and her share of the lease is left in the bureau,\u201d her voice was void of any warmth he may have gotten used to from her over the course of his relationship with her sister. Arya picks up the box by her feet and proceeded to head out. When she hovers by the door, he knows she wants to say something more. </p><p>\u201cJust spit it out, Arya.\u201d he closes his eyes, bracing himself for a tirade. </p><p>\u201cOut of all the assholes she dated, I never thought you&rsquo;d be the one capable of hurting her the most, Jon.\u201d </p><p>Jon can&rsquo;t open his eyes after hearing those words, already feeling his guilt from earlier transform into something nastier. He only opens them to see her walk away. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d he turns at the sound of his voice and sees Jeyne\u2019s pitying face. \u201cSansa asked that you be given this.\u201d She hands him an envelope with his name written in her neat script. </p><p>Jon snaps out of an emotionally induced paralysis when Jeyne moves to leave. \u201cPlease Jeyne,\u201d he croaks out, afraid of this moment being the punctuation to their messy relationship. \u201cCan you at least let me know what I&rsquo;ve done? How can I - what can I do to -\u201d </p><p>He&rsquo;s a mess, he knows he&rsquo;s a mess because just the thought of not having Sansa in any capacity in his life is giving him a panic attack. </p><p>Jeyne just gives him the same pitying look. \u201cJust read her note, Jon.\u201d It isn&rsquo;t until he hears the door click that he remembers to release the breath he has been holding in.</p><p>As if in a trance, he goes inside what used to be their room. It was bare of anything with her things gone and with him setting up camp in the living room. He sees her keys on the bedside table and stops at the painting of a lake from his childhood - the one where his mom used to take him as a boy. It had a pleasant shade from a nearby oak tree with a tire swing hanging from one of its branches. </p><p>It was the painting he drew a dick on and he could kick himself for not recognizing it right away. </p><p>He hastily opens the envelope, his heart pounding because <i>My God Sansa</i> - </p><p>He unfolds the letter and collapses on the bed.</p><p><i>Jon - </i></p><p><i>You win. You get to keep the apartment. </i></p><p><i>I want you to know, I don&rsquo;t regret you or the time we spent together. I just regret that we both suck terribly at communicating.

I guess we&rsquo;re just not good for each other. </i></p><p><i>The painting, as you may have deduced, is the one from your childhood you told me about before. I sneaked out a photo from your albums while you were gone. Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s taped to the back of the frame. </i></p><p><i>I wanted to give it as a peace offering. An olive branch, I guess. </i></p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t resent you for what you did. I think it just made me realize that whatever this is that remaibs between us is probably best left alone.

He had to scrub a portion of the painting off with thinner so he could make space for his own art. He thinks he did more than okay. </p><p>But something about the way she stiffened and the thinning of her lips told him that it was something different. Too caught up in his own childish antics, he didn\u2019t really take note of it until now.
