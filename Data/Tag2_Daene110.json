According to Brian Cogman, the script was originally titled \u201cThe Mad Kings Daughter\u201d, although many of the references in\u00a0the script did not make it to the end product. Daenerys herself doesn\u2019t appear to be showing any signs of being delusional or any sign of being insane as such, but it would be foolish to ignore the fact that she is deliberately following in her father\u2019s footsteps, even while protesting she is\u00a0\u201cnot [her] father\u201d.</p><p>She makes a conscious decision to embrace\u00a0her family\u2019s legacy of\u00a0\u201cFire and Blood\u201d, and this includes the ruthless suppression of dissent through dragon fire. It is a dream of absolute power which brooks no opposition.</p><p>Although you could argue that a person who shows a preference for killing people by burning them alive may not be living their best self, she clearly does this with a rational desire to intimidate her enemies. Her emotionless response to watching people die is disturbing and could point to sociopathic tendencies, but in Westerosii society is unlikely to be labelled as\u00a0\u2018mad\u2019. Many both in-universe and out would view this as strength.</p><p>Something that is made clear all the way back in Season 1 by Maester Pycelle, is that her father did not start out as mad. He says he was a\u00a0\u2018charmer\u2019 who was slowly\u00a0\u2018consumed by dreams of fire and blood\u2019. In the books, we learn that his slide into madness began as paranoia, probably aided by the machinations of his Lannister Hand. But that is beyond the scope of this meta.</p><p>There is a deep pathos to the way Pycelle talks of Aerys.\u00a0 This scene, often dismissed as the ravings of an unlikeable fool, foreshadows Daenerys\u2019 slide, if not into madness, at least into villainy. It is our warning, too easily dismissed.</p><p>There were two incidents included in Season 7 that seem to be pointing to a growing paranoia. In the books Daenerys is constantly looking for betrayal, always wondering of what the\u00a0\u2018three treasons\u2019 might consist. In the show, there is little to point to this internal turmoil. The treasons prophecy itself never made it into the show.\u00a0</p><p>We have the deleted scene from Season 4 between her and Missendei, and it is a shame it wasn\u2019t included. It would have made the two Season 7 scenes appear to come less out of the blue.\u00a0</p><p>In the beach scene, Daenerys startles her advisors with her sudden accusations against Tyrion. Look at her expression. Eyes wide, almost popping out of her head with anger. Missendei is even shown cowering behind Varys. Jon is looking around with a\u00a0\u2018good grief, is this normal\u2019 expression.</p><p>The next scene is another one where she turns on Tyrion, this time with little justification.

Their ideas, their sense of morality, matches with one another. Ygritte was trying to change him into being a Wildling, and that is where the line draws really. She wanted him to be loyal to only her, which wasn\u2019t acceptable to Jon since he was also loyal to the NW. Regardless of that, I can\u2019t blame her for wanting nothing else but her and Jon. She\u2019s strong, but she comes from simple life, and she\u2019s met this handsome man who makes her happy.

The Lannisters have been trying to wipe out the Stark&rsquo;s and in some instances have been successful and people are really hoping that Cersei can team up with the Stark&rsquo;s to take out Dany\ud83d\ude32 It&rsquo;s like,to hell with Ned,Robb,Talisa,Catelyn and by association Ricon. Dany being taken out so that she is out of the way of a certain crackship is more important than dealing with the family who is responsible for the almost demise of the Stark&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t even know why am acting surprised when these are some of the same people who are foaming at the mouth that Jamie is going to pledge his sword to the Redhead in the North,the same man who is responsible for Bran almost dying and being a cripple,killing Jory and almost killing Ned. But I guess as long as Jon gets to bang the Redhead all is well with some.
