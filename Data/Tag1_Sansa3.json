I can understand why you would think Cat was her dad's favorite, but I'm confused about Sansa's inclusion. Why do you think Sansa is Ned or even Cat's favorite child? To me, Sansa is the easy child. It's like that old saying: \"The squeaky wheel gets the oil\". She met their expectations,so they left her alone. They had other more rebellious children to worry about.",
        "answer": "<p>I kinda had a feeling I would get a comment about this because I know there\u2019s Discourse over the idea that Sansa didn\u2019t get enough attention from her parents or was treated unfairly in favor of Arya, and I think that comes from Sansa\u2019s own feelings of jealousy over Arya getting attention and her anxiety about being the perfect child. But that is very much a\u00a0\u201cfavored child\u201d thing, needing to be the favored child all the time. I think she was the easy child and she was often praised for that and expected to be that. She\u2019s also the firstborn girl in her family, which makes her special in the eyes of her parents and adds an additional need that she fit the social expectations of a girl, and since she excelled at that she was favored in that respect. That doesn\u2019t mean I think she necessarily got more attention than any of the others, and I mean, it\u2019s not a competition so Idk why some people are trying to make it one where Sansa is Most Neglected or something. I compared her to Catelyn thinking that her father loved her best because she always did her duty, because Sansa WAS favored in that respect, and I think Sansa had the same mindset, that if she always did what she was supposed to then her parents would love her the best, which had the side effect of creating a complex where she always NEEDED to live up to other people\u2019s expectations, and both Catelyn and Sansa have that problem. They are also both the eldest girl in their family so I think that added to the conception that they needed to be special.</p><p>I think she was favored in some ways and neglected in others and I think that does do damage that is reflected in her pov. And, I mean, this is how patriarchy works, it\u2019s a double-edged sword where women are cut no matter what they do. But Arya was the same way, although in different ways. Both of them suffered from the way society treats girls. Sansa was favored and praised for her ability to conform to societal expectations:</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. <b>I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself</b>. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft &hellip; the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.\u201d</p><p>This quote shows that not only was Sansa praised for being beautiful and ladylike, but she received special personal attention from her parents because of it. Which is precisely why Sansa gets jealous when Arya receives attention <i>despite</i>\u00a0and sometimes <i>because of</i>\u00a0not living up to expectations. I think Sansa had higher expectations placed on her and so she would be held to a higher expectation, which is why she gets upset when Ned praises Arya for picking wildflowers and getting dirty, for instance, something that if Sansa did, she would probably be scolded for.</p><p>We also know from both Cat and Ned and Arya and Sansa\u2019s pov that Sansa was held up as the example for Arya to live up to many times, by her parents and by Septa Mordane. They may have left Sansa alone in terms of disciplining or teaching her because they didn\u2019t need to, she\u2019s the good child and she would always do what was expected of her, but she was also constantly expected to be an example, which puts pressure both on Arya and on Sansa to live up to that expectation.</p><p>I get annoyed with this sort of discourse because not only is it just another aspect of Ye Olden Arya vs Sansa Fandom War, but there seems to be this conception that if, like Sansa, girls and women do everything right and are the perfect image of femininity, there\u2019s a way to win against the patriarchy, and it\u2019s <i>other people</i>\u00a0who are at fault for not appreciating Sansa\u2019s perfectness, or whatever. You can\u2019t win by playing their game, though. Patriarchy is set up for women to fail no matter what they do, which is why neither Arya nor Sansa won the\u00a0\u201cperfect daughter\u201d contest, and why both ended up feeling like the other did at times.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I kinda had a feeling I would get a comment about this because I know there&rsquo;s Discourse over the idea that Sansa didn&rsquo;t get enough attention from her parents or was treated unfairly in favor of Arya, and I think that comes from Sansa&rsquo;s own feelings of jealousy over Arya getting attention and her anxiety about being the perfect child. But that is very much a&nbsp;&ldquo;favored child&rdquo; thing, needing to be the favored child all the time. I think she was the easy child and she was often praised for that and expected to be that. She&rsquo;s also the firstborn girl in her family, which makes her special in the eyes of her parents and adds an additional need that she fit the social expectations of a girl, and since she excelled at that she was favored in that respect. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I think she necessarily got more attention than any of the others, and I mean, it&rsquo;s not a competition so Idk why some people are trying to make it one where Sansa is Most Neglected or something. I compared her to Catelyn thinking that her father loved her best because she always did her duty, because Sansa WAS favored in that respect, and I think Sansa had the same mindset, that if she always did what she was supposed to then her parents would love her the best, which had the side effect of creating a complex where she always NEEDED to live up to other people&rsquo;s expectations, and both Catelyn and Sansa have that problem. They are also both the eldest girl in their family so I think that added to the conception that they needed to be special.</p><p>I think she was favored in some ways and neglected in others and I think that does do damage that is reflected in her pov. And, I mean, this is how patriarchy works, it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword where women are cut no matter what they do. But Arya was the same way, although in different ways. Both of them suffered from the way society treats girls. Sansa was favored and praised for her ability to conform to societal expectations:</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. <b>I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself</b>. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft &hellip; the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.&rdquo;</p><p>This quote shows that not only was Sansa praised for being beautiful and ladylike, but she received special personal attention from her parents because of it. Which is precisely why Sansa gets jealous when Arya receives attention <i>despite</i>&nbsp;and sometimes <i>because of</i>&nbsp;not living up to expectations. I think Sansa had higher expectations placed on her and so she would be held to a higher expectation, which is why she gets upset when Ned praises Arya for picking wildflowers and getting dirty, for instance, something that if Sansa did, she would probably be scolded for.</p><p>We also know from both Cat and Ned and Arya and Sansa&rsquo;s pov that Sansa was held up as the example for Arya to live up to many times, by her parents and by Septa Mordane. They may have left Sansa alone in terms of disciplining or teaching her because they didn&rsquo;t need to, she&rsquo;s the good child and she would always do what was expected of her, but she was also constantly expected to be an example, which puts pressure both on Arya and on Sansa to live up to that expectation.</p><p>I get annoyed with this sort of discourse because not only is it just another aspect of Ye Olden Arya vs Sansa Fandom War, but there seems to be this conception that if, like Sansa, girls and women do everything right and are the perfect image of femininity, there&rsquo;s a way to win against the patriarchy, and it&rsquo;s <i>other people</i>&nbsp;who are at fault for not appreciating Sansa&rsquo;s perfectness, or whatever. You can&rsquo;t win by playing their game, though. Patriarchy is set up for women to fail no matter what they do, which is why neither Arya nor Sansa won the&nbsp;&ldquo;perfect daughter&rdquo; contest, and why both ended up feeling like the other did at times.</p>",
