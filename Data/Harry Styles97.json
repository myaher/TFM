                "content": "<p>This imagine is based of the song &ldquo;Adore&rdquo; by Amy Shark. If you want to listen to it while reading, to set the mood ;), you can do that<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-IoluTnuKs\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>. The lyrics are in italics. For the sake of the story, I didn&rsquo;t include all of them, just about a little more than half into the song. <br /></p><hr /><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm<br />I&rsquo;m just gonna walk home kicking stones at parked cars</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>It was about 3:30 am and I was on my way home. My heals were dangling in my right hand, I couldn&rsquo;t bear to wear them for even a second longer. My little purse was dangling from my left arm, which still felt warm from the touch of him. I never thought that anybody could get so infatuated with a person so fast, but I did, obviously. Just the thought of him had me smiling from ear to ear. He was&hellip; breathtaking. I&rsquo;ve never seen him before that night in the pub, but Craig, a mutual friend, had introduced him today. And as he smiled at me for the first time, I felt warm, and safe, and&hellip; dazzled. Never happened to me before. Could you fall in love at first sight? Stupid, stupid, stupid. Where was this confident, independent young woman which I was proud to be? All gone now, just by the thought of him? I was so frustrated at myself, that I began to kick around little rocks that were on the street. I hit a car by accident, but I was too intoxicated to care. <i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>But I had a great night, &lsquo;cause you kept rubbing against my arm<br />I&rsquo;m just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>But he was more than just a pretty face, so much more. I actually did get to know him a bit that night, because he was very talkative, at least to the rest of our group. It was a bit embarrassing, but I nearly didn&rsquo;t talk <i>to</i> him at all. Just a litte &lsquo;hello&rsquo;, that was all. But I listened to him. He had a nice voice, so it was comfortable hearing him tell the others about what he did for a living, how he was excited to meet us all, since Craig had told him so much about us and had made him curious. <br /></p><p>The later it had gotten, the more people that some of my friends had invited too, were joining us. Soon, it was very crowded in our booth, so we all had to squeeze in a bit. Fortunately, he was sitting next to me. So from then on, our arms were touching. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is that okay, love?&rdquo;, he had asked in that deep, raspy voice of his. Immediately, I could feel a shiver running down my back at the new nickname.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo;, I said, hoping that I didn&rsquo;t give myself away. Yep, that was the second word I had spoken to him.</p><p>When we had ordered our second round of beers, and my hand had been resting on my thigh for a little while now, he had put his hand on his thigh, too. Then, with the conversation going on, he had inched his hand slowly towards mine. I had never felt butterflies like that before. And when he finally touched it, it was as if I had forgotten how to breathe, at least for a few seconds. He turned a little bit and smiled at me, that didn&rsquo;t help with my breathing at all. But I still managed to smile back. <br /></p><p>Now, it was as if I could still feel that spark of electricity from the lingering touch. Oh god, when had I gone back to puberty again?<br /></p><p><br /><i>Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip just so I can adore you<br />I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t have as much to drink as usually on these nights, I had felt pretty intoxicated pretty early into the night. And his alluring scent hadn&rsquo;t helped with that either. I didn&rsquo;t know if it was cologne, simply him, or maybe just a delicious mixture, but I had absolutely loved it and I still did. I inhaled deeply, first the cold night air, then the scent that still lingered in his jacket he had given me for the walk home.</p><p> I had been torn between wanting to be all alone with him, and being glad that I could just watch his lips curve around the words he was saying without having to pay too much attention. <i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>Now go when you&rsquo;re ready<br />My head&rsquo;s getting heavy pressed against your arm<br />I adore you</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>The longer we had been sitting there, him holding my hand under the table, the more tired I had grown. He was just so comforting, but at the same time very exciting to be around. It was pretty hard to explain. Soon my head had found its way against his shoulder. I was earning some stares from some of my friends, especially the few girls who had joined us tonight, but honestly, I couldn&rsquo;t care less. And I felt even more content, when his right hand, who had been holding my left all night, snaked its way behind my back around my waist. How could a boy that I just met have such an enormous effect on me? Damn. <br /></p><p>When the pub was nearly closing, we had decided to all just go home. I missed his warmth immediately after I had gotten up, and I still did. He had given me his jacket, so I could keep warm on my short walk to my appartment. And he had made me tipe my number into his phone, sending me a quick text after, so I had his number, too.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N), what a beautiful name. Suits you.&rdquo; Could I ever get his voice out of my head?</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. And thanks again for the jacket&rdquo;, I had said, before turning around to say goodbye to the rest of my friends. Comparing that to the rest of the night, I had really said much.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Should I walk you home?&rdquo;, he had asked, as I had turned around to him again. Remembering that he lived in the other side of town, I had said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine, thanks, Harry.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Text me when you&rsquo;re home, okay? Don&rsquo;t wanna worry all night, you know?&rdquo;, he had said, quickly kissing my cheekbone right after. I had blushed a deep red for sure. &ldquo;Will do&rdquo;, I had answered, squeezing his hand, that had sneaked his way into mine again. Then we parted ways. <br /></p><p>So now, I was walking still with that silly smile on my lips. I was nearly home now, when I felt my phone vibrate in my back pocket. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You already home, love? -H.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>Sooo, that&rsquo;s about it. I haven&rsquo;t written anything in ages, let alone post it here on this blog, that has a new name actually. It was formerly known blurbs-writing, maybe you still remember. I also have a little bit of trouble with masterlist, so I can&rsquo;t link that (yet, I hope).
