Since Kacey songs about Kacey are always better than Kacey songs about other people, she\u2019s at her most masterful in \u201cSlow Burn\u201d: \u201cTexas is hot, I can be cold, Grandma cried when I pierced my nose.",

Uh\u2014you\u2019re going to be wonderful,\u201d she smiled, on the verge of tears as she excused herself. </p><p>Harry followed her, and caught her just in time to hear her sniffling and see her arm come up as she wiped her tears.</p><p>\u201cHey. Baby,\u201d Harry tried quietly to get her attention as she made her way to the bathroom of Jane\u2019s home.

Okay?\u201d He asked as she cried more, a long sigh leaving her mouth as tears steamed down her cheeks. </p><p>Harry kissed her lips, cupping her face still. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen. I promise, okay? It\u2019s going to happen. \u2018s just taking a little bit longer for us, okay? But it\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re perfect, y\u2019hear me?\u201d He hummed, holding her close to him, his hand tangled in her hair as he kissed her head a few times.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been over twelve months, Harry. That\u2019s a whole year,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhen? I want it to happen now,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Harry closed his eyes and felt he warm tears seep out. \u201cI know, my baby but we have to be patient, okay? Hm?\u201d </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Harry was sat playing his guitar, trying to figure out which tune was best for this new beat he had created for his album.</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d He heard Y/N scream.</p><p>A second later she was running into his music room (really, it was just a room with rugs, sound proof walls, and bean bags, and a couch.) Harry stood up and put his guitar to the side as she ran into his arms.</p><p>She was taking another pregnancy test earlier.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll keep trying-\u201c he began, his chest heavy already. <i>It\u2019s been a year</i> of nothing. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Y/N cried, holding the pregnancy test up. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, baby! We did it!\u201d </p><p>Harry audibly gasped, his eyes wide as he took the pregnancy test from her hands. Once he saw the word \u2018pregnant\u2019 he lost it. The test was dropped and he picked up his wife instead, spinning her around and kissing her lips multiple times, over and over again.</p><p>\u201cWe did it! Oh my\u2014\u201c he laughed loudly. \u201cWe did it, Y/N! Oh, <i>my love,</i>\u201d he cried as he hugged her. \u201c<i>My</i> <i>love</i>,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a little baby,\u201d he laughed through his tears. \u201cI love you so much. I knew we\u2019d do it,\u201d he was then getting on his knees. He pushed her shirt up and left wet kisses all over her stomach. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a baby,\u201d he said excitedly before he was standing again, holding Y/N\u2019s face between his big hands and pressing a loud, wet kiss to her lips. Then another. \u201cI love you,\u201d he smiled before giving her another obnoxious kiss. \u201c<i>I</i> <i>love you so much</i>,\u201d he kissed her again, holding her face as tightly as he could with out hurting her. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a baby,\u201d she cried. </p><p>\u201cWhat month is it?\u201d Harry grinned, sniffling. \u201cWe\u2019re in June&hellip;.that\u2019s&hellip;aw, we\u2019re going to have a March baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little March baby!\u201d Y/N cooed. \u201cOh, hopefully it\u2019s still a little chilly so we can dress them in warm sweaters and wrap them up in little blankies everywhere we go,\u201d Y/N spoke hopefully as Harry wiped her tears. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cHarry and I are having a baby!\u201d Y/N cheered, at a small dinner that consisted only of Harry, Anne, Gemma, her boyfriend, Y/N\u2019s siblings, and Y/N\u2019s parents.</p><p>Anne (having experienced first hand how upset they were that they couldn\u2019t conceive) immediately had tears in her eyes as she gasped, standing from the table and walking over to the two. \u201cCongratulations! Oh, you two are going to make the perfect parents! I love you both so much! <i>Congratulations</i>,\u201d she laughed, hugging the both of them at one time.</p><p>Everyone was clapping and cooing and cheering, and Y/N was overjoyed.</p><p>She\u2019s pregnant!</p><p>There\u2019s going to be a little tiny baby here soon, half of her, and half of <i>him</i>. </p><p>She was over the moon.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe it. We\u2019re going to be <i>parents</i>,\u201d Harry grinned, hugging her. </p><p>Just the word, in reference to her and Harry, made her begin to cry. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the most amazing dad, Harry,\u201d she cried. </p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He laughed softly through his tears. \u201cYou\u2019re going to a phenomenal mummy, baby,\u201d he laughed, sniffling before kissing her lips, his hand on her tummy that he couldn\u2019t wait to see grow.</p>",

Uh\u2014you\u2019re going to be wonderful,\u201d she smiled, on the verge of tears as she excused herself. </p><p>Harry followed her, and caught her just in time to hear her sniffling and see her arm come up as she wiped her tears.</p><p>\u201cHey. Baby,\u201d Harry tried quietly to get her attention as she made her way to the bathroom of Jane\u2019s home. Harry swiftly followed her in, closing the door behind himself. \u201cDarling, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Harry,\u201d she whined through her tears. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, Y/N.

She took a pregnancy test this morning, and they had been waiting for the results. </p><p>\u201cIt was another no?\u201d Harry asked, and when she nodded, in tears, Harry\u2019s eyes watered too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he said quickly, pulling her jnto another hug. </p><p>\u201cYes it is,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault it doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve been trying for so long and,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m sorry. I know how bad you want this, I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d she was crying hysterically and Harry didn\u2019t even have time to explain to Anne what was going on.</p><p>\u201cNo, stop it,\u201d Harry cupped her cheeks. \u201cHey, look at me,\u201d he cooed as she looked down, ashamed. \u201cMine of this is your fault.

Okay?\u201d He asked as she cried more, a long sigh leaving her mouth as tears steamed down her cheeks. </p><p>Harry kissed her lips, cupping her face still. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen. I promise, okay? It\u2019s going to happen. \u2018s just taking a little bit longer for us, okay? But it\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re perfect, y\u2019hear me?\u201d He hummed, holding her close to him, his hand tangled in her hair as he kissed her head a few times.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been over twelve months, Harry. That\u2019s a whole year,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhen? I want it to happen now,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Harry closed his eyes and felt he warm tears seep out. \u201cI know, my baby but we have to be patient, okay?

Harry stood up and put his guitar to the side as she ran into his arms.</p><p>She was taking another pregnancy test earlier.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll keep trying-\u201c he began, his chest heavy already. <i>It\u2019s been a year</i> of nothing. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Y/N cried, holding the pregnancy test up. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, baby! We did it!\u201d </p><p>Harry audibly gasped, his eyes wide as he took the pregnancy test from her hands. Once he saw the word \u2018pregnant\u2019 he lost it. The test was dropped and he picked up his wife instead, spinning her around and kissing her lips multiple times, over and over again.</p><p>\u201cWe did it! Oh my\u2014\u201c he laughed loudly. \u201cWe did it, Y/N!

New Years will be spent with Y/N\u2019s. </p><p>Harry was playing a game wirh everyone, while Y/N watched from the kitchen where she sat on her phone. (She\u2019d lost the round before therefore no one wanted her on their team this time. Especially Harry.) </p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d She shrieked, staring at her phone. </p><p>Everyone was so consumed in the game\u2014and they were all screaming and laughing (her husband being the loudest of course as he scolded whoever said the wrong answer and cheered when the opposing team got it wrong.) </p><p>\u201c<i>Yeah</i>!\u201d He screamed, fist in the air as Y/N speedwalked over to him. She bent beside him to whisper in his ear, mumbling a few excuse me\u2019s as she made her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ovulating,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cTime out! I-we will be right back! Keep going without me,\u201d he stood up from the couch, taking Y/N\u2019s hand (they have no time to waste. \u201cGemma,\u201d he called as they walked to the stairs. \u201cYou\u2019re the only hope! Carry the team and if I come back and you all have lost so help me\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cThe hell see you goin\u2019 anyway?\u201d Harry\u2019s cousin called. </p><p>\u201cWe have to make a phone call!\u201d Harry screamed before laughing as he and Y/N ran up the stairs and straight to his childhood bedroom.</p><p>Harry locked the door and while he did that Y/N was removing her red dress, pulling her tights down as well (her heels had been removed within the first two hours of the party). </p><p>Harry took off his shirt, unbuttoning his jeans and letting them fall to his ankles before the two kissed, falling onto Harry\u2019s twin sized bed. </p><p>\u201cGonna work this time,\u201d Harry promised. \u201cGonna make a baby together,\u201d he spoke, hopeful. </p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d she hummed, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>Harry breathed deeply as he removed her underwear, then his own. He rubbed himself up against her clit a few times before he was inside of her, the two moaning at the familiar yet still <i>amazing</i> feeling. </p><p>\u201cGotta admit,\u201d Harry groaned as he thrusted. \u201cThe trying has been fun.\u201d </p><p>Fun, yes. But it\u2019s also been exhausting. And not just physically. </p><p>The two were mentally drained. It\u2019s been six months of constant sex. Running to the nearest bedroom, bathroom\u2014hell it was even a closet once. </p><p>They want a baby.</p><p>\u201cTrying has been fun but I want a baby already,\u201d Y/N mumbled, wrapping her legs around his hips as she let out another moan.</p><p>\u201cI love yeh, baby but need you to keep it down, yeah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded in agreement, her back arching as Harry hit that particular spot inside of her. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groaned as she clenched, his thrusts becoming faster, the old bed beneath them beginning to squeak.</p><p>\u201cOh, Harry\u2014I\u2019m close,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cCome, princess. Get me there,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s toes curled as she felt completely full and she was suddenly sensitive\u2014a long moan left her lips as she came, and Harry came immediately after, something about the way she looks and sound when she comes (and the simple fact that <i>he</i> was able to get her there) always did it for him. </p><p>He groaned as he gave her a few last, hard thrusts, his come spurting into her\u2014she moaned quietly, \u201cI think that one did it.\u201d </p><p>Harry was panting as he nodded, \u201cthink so too.\u201d</p><p>After that, Y/N layed with her legs crossed tightly, ensuring that none of his come leaked out. (Harry spent that time kissing her cheeks and neck and breasts, mumbling how much he loved her and how they would never stop trying no matter what). </p><p>After a solid five minutes they got dressed again, going downstairs to find everyone in the same yelling fit that they\u2019d left them in.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re free,\u201d Y/N laughed, and so did Harry.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he didn\u2019t let go of her hand (theirs were interlocked) and pulled her with him to the couch. He pulled her onto his lap, kissing her cheek a few times. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said softly as she layed comfortably on the couch, her head resting on Harry\u2019s chest now as she sighed and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe need you, Harry!\u201d Gemma screamed. \u201cMum\u2019s rubbish at this!\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Hey</i>!\u201d Anne was shocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting this round out,\u201d Harry laughed before looking down to his beautiful wife, whom he so desperately wants a baby with. He pushed some of her hair aaay from her face. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She smiled, kissing his wrist that was near her face since he\u2019d been cupping her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHope our baby looks like you,\u201d Harry mumbled. </p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><a href=\"https://and-im-okay-with-it.tumblr.com/post/181484231636/harry-yn-try-to-get-pregnant-pt2\">Part 2 \ud83d\udc97</a></p>",
