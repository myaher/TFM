Please forgive any typos. I\u2019m so sorry!!</h2><p>Previously:</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> sorr<i>y for hitting you, Steve.&ldquo; I smiled and went to speak but she put her hand up to silence me. &quot;I know I didn&rsquo;t hurt you but I want you to know that I&rsquo;ve never done anything like that before. The things I&rsquo;ve said to you these past few days, I&rsquo;ve never said to anyone. I&rsquo;ve always been dutiful and what I&rsquo;m expected to be. I don&rsquo;t know why I keep lashing out at you and for that, I am so very sorry. You are the last person that deserves that when so many other people are responsible for &hellip;breaking me.&rdquo; Her voice gave out in the last part. I put my hand up to her face and he looked up into my eyes. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t know why I bring out the fight in you but I will wear it like a fucking badge of honor because I love the fire in your eyes. I&rsquo;ve seen it more and more each day since I&rsquo;ve met you.&rdquo; I leaned in and kissed her food and she grabbed my biceps tightly like she might float away. Then just like that, she was gone. She let go of me and left me standing in the hall to my own thoughts while she rushed behind the safety of her door barely saving me a glance. </i></p><p><i>We&rsquo;re all broken, but we&rsquo;re never beyond repair, I&rsquo;ll make her see that if it&rsquo;s the last thing I do.</i></p><p>That night it was safe to say the neither you nor Steve got any sleep. You kept thinking of how much of fucked up mess you were in and trying to figure out how to get out of the rabbit hole. Steve kept thinking of how beautiful you were and how affected he was with you in his arms, of how his body was fighting the urge to go to you at every waking moment. The next day was what you called a free day until the evening for the Mayor&rsquo;s gala that you and the Captain would attend together. You thought that talking to him about your game plan would ease some of the tensions from the previous evening, or that was your hope.</p><p>When you came out, he was leaning against the counter and had made breakfast for the two of you. It was surreally domesticated and it took a moment to get your bearings. He was reading a newspaper and drinking coffee and smiled when he saw you come in, while drinking in your presence. \u201cGood morning. I-I hope that you don&rsquo;t mind. I made pancakes.&ldquo; You nodded and sat down across from him and pretended that you didn&rsquo;t notice him looking at you before he cleared his throat and went back to the paper.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"961\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cdf9c5317e2a72d546066c25611350/tumblr_pbwj5mf0jO1v3tw6c_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"961\"/></figure><p>&quot;So..I have Sam and Bucky coming over today to go over a few things that I\u00a0 put together last night, I hope that you don't\u00a0mind.&rdquo; You shook your head and continued to eat. &ldquo;No that&rsquo;s fine. What did you find?&rdquo; He smiled at you and put down\u00a0the paper. &ldquo;Well, thanks to you and your prodding I was able to figure out the possible whereabouts of some team players and the guys are bringing over some maps from the intel that you delivered. I think we can pinpoint the best HYRDA bases to infiltrate and take down first. Making the biggest impact and hit the hardest first.&rdquo; He looked so pleased, and his eyes were alight it made you excited and you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. &ldquo;Speaking of which, I have a person that I want to introduce you to tonight.&rdquo; He leaned forward and took a piece of bacon off of your plate, and you paused a moment but shook off the intimacy of the act. He was so casual about so many things and you knew that you and he lived in two very different worlds and it made your heart break a bit more.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, so tell me about this person.&rdquo; You snapped back to the topic at hand. &ldquo;His name is Charles or Charlie. He is Vivian\u2019s main guard\u00a0detail. He wasn&rsquo;t there last night but he will certainly be there tonight. They are having an affair.&rdquo; Steve quirked an eyebrow and smirked at the gossip and you waved it off. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there. But he used to be my guard. He was here for 3 years and was head of security and ..he\u2019s a very good man.&rdquo; Steve looked down and his brows furrowed you saw his shoulder tense a bit. &ldquo;So, why was he fired. Were you and he&hellip;&rdquo; It took you a moment to realize the implication of how sounded to him. &ldquo;Oh, no..of course not. I&rsquo;ve only ever been with him.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0You said with disgust and Steve gave you that\u00a0look to say that he was sorry and you felt a need to tell him what happened with Charlie to clear the air.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Like I said Charlie was my detail and he\u00a0took me everywhere and we were..friends. Henry saw a picture of us in the paper and it made him look foolish. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know if he would&rsquo;ve been mad if I slept with Charlie as long as it didn&rsquo;t appear that way to anyone else. To my luck, though I was pictured in a gossip column and I was laughing next to Charlie and Henry didn&rsquo;t like it. At all. Henry hit me. Charlie intervened and they threw punches. In the end, I did not fair well. Charlie ..he asked me to run away with him.&rdquo; Steve and you locked eyes and his jaw twitched.</p><p>&ldquo;He loved you?&rdquo; You nodded. &ldquo;He said he did but I didn&rsquo;t at least not like that, so I said no. Henry doesn&rsquo;t know about the offer . In the end,\u00a0 Henry was humiliated. Charlie was fired. Vivian found herself a new head of security as a favor to me. Which she still thanks me to this day.&rdquo; He reached over the table and gently took your hand and you didn&rsquo;t remove it as he gently rubbed his thumb in soothing circles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry, doll. I&ndash; didn\u2019t&hellip;he&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo; You looked up into his steel blue eyes and saw an unshakeable determination that gave you strength and you just nodded and gave him a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, Charlie and I are still friends and if he thinks that you can help me &hellip;I think he&rsquo;d give you whatever you&rsquo;d want. Especially if he thinks that you love me and will do whatever you can to get me out of here and take Henry down.&rdquo; Steve nodded ignoring the sour taste in his mouth. Henry had you and another man was in love with you and now you had his heart. He was used to fighting battles on the field but he didn\u2019t know how to navigate this and how to win you. He was lost and he wanted you more than anything and the desire was dripping from his tongue. He sighed and had to power through. &ldquo;Easy &lsquo;nough. Point him out tonight and I&rsquo;ll talk to him, K?&rdquo; You smiled knowing that you could count on him.</p><p>A few hours later you were surprisingly comfortable surrounded by Nat, Sam, Bucky, and Steve on your living room floor. Papers were everywhere and you and Nat were drinking some wine, and the guys had a beer. At first, you were wildly tense at this but then after Sam started in with being..well Sam, you loosened up and you were actually enjoying yourself.</p><p>You had found several solid leads on some bases now all of you were relaxing. &ldquo;What time do you have to get ready for the gala, Y/N?&rdquo; Nat spoke from behind her glass of wine. You rolled your eyes ever so slightly, used to being discreet in your rebellious actions but still divulging in them. &ldquo;I need to start getting reading in an hour at the latest.\u201d She smirked and volunteered to help you getting ready. You tried to decline but secretly liked the idea of having an actual friend to help, one without ulterior motives. At least you hoped she didn&rsquo;t but she was\u00a0a world-class spy\u00a0so you could never be sure. You risked a glance at Steve and knew that he could read you like a book and that you were letting your guard down having fun. He desperately wanted you to have fun and that was why he invited them over in part, genuine friends and family for you to be a part of.\u00a0</p><p>He came and sat next to you on the floor and nudged your shoulder. &quot;So you like these idiots of mine, huh?&rdquo; You shrugged and nodded. &ldquo;You mean this ragtag bunch of heroes you got? Yea, they&rsquo;re not too bad.&rdquo; You laughed and he patted your jean-clad thigh and again you found that you didn&rsquo;t have to fight the urge to tense or flee. &ldquo;They like you, ya know?&quot;\u00a0 You smiled and leaned into him and he leaned down to you as you both held your own secret conversation.</p><p>&quot;You nervous about tonight, doll?&rdquo; You shook your head as he ran his thumb back and forth in soothing patterns on your thigh. &ldquo;Surprisingly, no. You&hellip;I feel safe with you. Thank you for that.&rdquo; He fought a smile. &ldquo;Even though I keep fucking it up?&rdquo; You looked up at him and he had gotten even closer to your face with his breath was fanning your hair and making your heart pick up in speed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just tested my boundaries and pushed me out of my comfort zone. I&rsquo;m the one who keeps fucking up, Steve. You&hellip;.you&rsquo;re..&rdquo; While finding your words you looked up at Sam, and he has his camera out on you and Steve and it gave you immediate unease so you felt a need to leave the room. You hastily made a near clumsy exit while Steve tried to figure out what happened.\u00a0</p><p>When his eyes found\u00a0 Sam, he gave him a stern look causing him to quickly apologized. He evidently meant no harm and just wanted a picture of you two to tease Cap later for going soft for a woman. You made off to your room and he was quick to follow but when you shut your door, he grabbed it and softly closed it behind him. &ldquo;Talk to me, Doll.&rdquo; You bit your lip and tried to control your breathing. &ldquo;Was Sam making fun of me?

It was aftershave and leather. So simple and yet so masculine. His breathing deepened and then he ever so slowly took a step closer to you pulling you into his strong arms and held you tight. Not since Charlie had you been held. Even then you never honestly felt safe. His body engulfed your small frame, and his warmth encased you. &quot;I got you.&rdquo; After a moment you allowed yourself to wrap your arms around his waist and he rested his head on yours and you knew then that you were done for. This man was trying to fix you and for the first time in your dreary existence, you had hope.\u00a0 You looked up into his eyes. &ldquo;Does anyone ever have you, Cap?&rdquo; He ran his hand over your lip and smiled. &ldquo;You may not realize it, but you&rsquo;ve had me since I&rsquo;ve seen your fire.&rdquo; When he said that you felt the boldness come out. Knowing that he liked that bit of you that every other person always tried to stifle and put out.\u00a0</p><p>You kissed his thumb and heard him take a sharp breath and look up through your lashes to him. He leaned in and licked his plump bottom lip and kissed you. Finally, after what felt like an endless dance between you two, he was finally kissing you. The forbidden fruit.\u00a0 You had waited so many years to feel this all-encompassing passion and it was right here before you. You didn&rsquo;t want to focus on how wrong it was and how many ways wither of you could be hurt. Instead, you concentrated on the feel of his soft and warm lips on yours. The way his chest was pressed against yours as you struggled to breathe but refused to break away from the kiss, not wanting it to end. Your hand boldly traveled up his muscular chest and broad shoulder, resting in long soft locks of hair. As your nails, scratched his scalp he let out a delicious moan that sent waves of pleasure to your core that you&rsquo;ve never felt before. One of his hands held your face and the other gripped your hip firmly and pulled yours as close as possible to his powerful body. When you could no longer take the lack of oxygen you broke away and he pressed his forehead against yours.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Wa&ndash;was that ok, Doll?&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t know what to say or what he was referring to. His performance? Offending you? &ldquo;Sorry, Steve?&rdquo; You shook your head and looked into his ocean blues unsure of what he was asking. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to cross a line that you don&rsquo;t want me crossing? I - I don&rsquo;t want to fuck anything up with you.&rdquo; You thought he was back peddling and regretting the passionate kiss but were unsure. The desperate look in his eyes and the way they were on you told you one thing but your self-doubt was screaming another. Self-preservation kicked in and you took a step back and saw the disappointment in his face.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;No, Steve. You didn\u2019t cross any lines. ..I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here though.&rdquo; He stood there a moment. You weren&rsquo;t sure if he wanted to kiss you again or say something. Either you would be ok with but you&rsquo;d be lying if you said you didn&rsquo;t crave his kiss more than air.\u00a0 However, nothing came.\u00a0</p><p>Nat interrupted the silence with a knock on the door and Steve looked perturbed but let her in to help you get ready for the gala.\u00a0</p><p>_________________________________</p><p>You wee lost in thought and found that your fingers kept touching your lips where he kissed you, his lips still ghosting over them. His lingering taste and feel still burning you deliciously.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s on your mind, Y/N?&ldquo; You shook your head and came back to the moment. &quot;Nothing, thank you for getting me ready for tonight. Really not into it, you know.&rdquo; She nodded and waved a theatrical all done for you then plopped down in the closest chair.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I understand. You ok? I mean with all of this?&rdquo; You liked Nat, she was real and didn&rsquo;t put up with any shit from anyone. You could take a few notes from her. &ldquo;Actually better than I thought I would be.&rdquo; She smiled a genuine smile. &ldquo;Yea, Steve has a way about him.&rdquo; You pinched your brows together, did he do this a lot with women he helped? Were you just another. Nat picked up on your misunderstanding of the exchanged and casually went to clarify. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get close to people very often, but when he does, he&rsquo;s loyal to a fault. He will fight to the death for them and you can feel it all around you. The safety, the friendship, the total love. He and Bucky both will give you they&rsquo;re all.

            "comment": "<p><h2>Stolen choices</h2><h2>Chapter four</h2><h2>Down the Rabbit Hole</h2><h2>I am literally on a flight to Ireland at this moment and posting this as I\u2019m required to go on airplane mode. Please forgive any typos. I\u2019m so sorry!!</h2><p>Previously:</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> sorr<i>y for hitting you, Steve.\u201c I smiled and went to speak but she put her hand up to silence me. \"I know I didn\u2019t hurt you but I want you to know that I\u2019ve never done anything like that before. The things I\u2019ve said to you these past few days, I\u2019ve never said to anyone. I\u2019ve always been dutiful and what I\u2019m expected to be. I don\u2019t know why I keep lashing out at you and for that, I am so very sorry. You are the last person that deserves that when so many other people are responsible for \u2026breaking me.\u201d Her voice gave out in the last part. I put my hand up to her face and he looked up into my eyes. \u201c I don\u2019t know why I bring out the fight in you but I will wear it like a fucking badge of honor because I love the fire in your eyes. I\u2019ve seen it more and more each day since I\u2019ve met you.\u201d I leaned in and kissed her food and she grabbed my biceps tightly like she might float away. Then just like that, she was gone. She let go of me and left me standing in the hall to my own thoughts while she rushed behind the safety of her door barely saving me a glance. </i></p><p><i>We\u2019re all broken, but we\u2019re never beyond repair, I\u2019ll make her see that if it\u2019s the last thing I do.</i></p><p>That night it was safe to say the neither you nor Steve got any sleep. You kept thinking of how much of fucked up mess you were in and trying to figure out how to get out of the rabbit hole. Steve kept thinking of how beautiful you were and how affected he was with you in his arms, of how his body was fighting the urge to go to you at every waking moment. The next day was what you called a free day until the evening for the Mayor\u2019s gala that you and the Captain would attend together. You thought that talking to him about your game plan would ease some of the tensions from the previous evening, or that was your hope.</p><p>When you came out, he was leaning against the counter and had made breakfast for the two of you. It was surreally domesticated and it took a moment to get your bearings. He was reading a newspaper and drinking coffee and smiled when he saw you come in, while drinking in your presence. \u201cGood morning. I-I hope that you don\u2019t mind. I made pancakes.\u201c You nodded and sat down across from him and pretended that you didn\u2019t notice him looking at you before he cleared his throat and went back to the paper.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"961\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cdf9c5317e2a72d546066c25611350/tumblr_pbwj5mf0jO1v3tw6c_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"961\"></figure><p>\"So..I have Sam and Bucky coming over today to go over a few things that I\u00a0 put together last night, I hope that you don't\u00a0mind.\u201d You shook your head and continued to eat. \u201cNo that\u2019s fine. What did you find?\u201d He smiled at you and put down\u00a0the paper. \u201cWell, thanks to you and your prodding I was able to figure out the possible whereabouts of some team players and the guys are bringing over some maps from the intel that you delivered. I think we can pinpoint the best HYRDA bases to infiltrate and take down first. Making the biggest impact and hit the hardest first.\u201d He looked so pleased, and his eyes were alight it made you excited and you couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cSpeaking of which, I have a person that I want to introduce you to tonight.\u201d He leaned forward and took a piece of bacon off of your plate, and you paused a moment but shook off the intimacy of the act. He was so casual about so many things and you knew that you and he lived in two very different worlds and it made your heart break a bit more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYea, so tell me about this person.\u201d You snapped back to the topic at hand. \u201cHis name is Charles or Charlie. He is Vivian\u2019s main guard\u00a0detail. He wasn\u2019t there last night but he will certainly be there tonight. They are having an affair.\u201d Steve quirked an eyebrow and smirked at the gossip and you waved it off. \u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there. But he used to be my guard. He was here for 3 years and was head of security and ..he\u2019s a very good man.\u201d Steve looked down and his brows furrowed you saw his shoulder tense a bit. \u201cSo, why was he fired. Were you and he\u2026\u201d It took you a moment to realize the implication of how sounded to him. \u201cOh, no..of course not. I\u2019ve only ever been with him.\"\u00a0\u00a0You said with disgust and Steve gave you that\u00a0look to say that he was sorry and you felt a need to tell him what happened with Charlie to clear the air.\u00a0</p><p>\"Like I said Charlie was my detail and he\u00a0took me everywhere and we were..friends. Henry saw a picture of us in the paper and it made him look foolish. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if he would\u2019ve been mad if I slept with Charlie as long as it didn\u2019t appear that way to anyone else. To my luck, though I was pictured in a gossip column and I was laughing next to Charlie and Henry didn\u2019t like it. At all. Henry hit me. Charlie intervened and they threw punches. In the end, I did not fair well. Charlie ..he asked me to run away with him.\u201d Steve and you locked eyes and his jaw twitched.</p><p>\u201cHe loved you?\u201d You nodded. \u201cHe said he did but I didn\u2019t at least not like that, so I said no. Henry doesn\u2019t know about the offer . In the end,\u00a0 Henry was humiliated. Charlie was fired. Vivian found herself a new head of security as a favor to me. Which she still thanks me to this day.\u201d He reached over the table and gently took your hand and you didn\u2019t remove it as he gently rubbed his thumb in soothing circles. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, doll. I\u2013 didn\u2019t\u2026he\u2019ll pay.\u201d You looked up into his steel blue eyes and saw an unshakeable determination that gave you strength and you just nodded and gave him a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Charlie and I are still friends and if he thinks that you can help me \u2026I think he\u2019d give you whatever you\u2019d want. Especially if he thinks that you love me and will do whatever you can to get me out of here and take Henry down.\u201d Steve nodded ignoring the sour taste in his mouth. Henry had you and another man was in love with you and now you had his heart. He was used to fighting battles on the field but he didn\u2019t know how to navigate this and how to win you. He was lost and he wanted you more than anything and the desire was dripping from his tongue. He sighed and had to power through. \u201cEasy \u2018nough. Point him out tonight and I\u2019ll talk to him, K?\u201d You smiled knowing that you could count on him.</p><p>A few hours later you were surprisingly comfortable surrounded by Nat, Sam, Bucky, and Steve on your living room floor. Papers were everywhere and you and Nat were drinking some wine, and the guys had a beer. At first, you were wildly tense at this but then after Sam started in with being..well Sam, you loosened up and you were actually enjoying yourself.</p><p>You had found several solid leads on some bases now all of you were relaxing. \u201cWhat time do you have to get ready for the gala, Y/N?\u201d Nat spoke from behind her glass of wine. You rolled your eyes ever so slightly, used to being discreet in your rebellious actions but still divulging in them. \u201cI need to start getting reading in an hour at the latest.\u201d She smirked and volunteered to help you getting ready. You tried to decline but secretly liked the idea of having an actual friend to help, one without ulterior motives. At least you hoped she didn\u2019t but she was\u00a0a world-class spy\u00a0so you could never be sure. You risked a glance at Steve and knew that he could read you like a book and that you were letting your guard down having fun. He desperately wanted you to have fun and that was why he invited them over in part, genuine friends and family for you to be a part of.\u00a0</p><p>He came and sat next to you on the floor and nudged your shoulder. \"So you like these idiots of mine, huh?\u201d You shrugged and nodded. \u201cYou mean this ragtag bunch of heroes you got? Yea, they\u2019re not too bad.\u201d You laughed and he patted your jean-clad thigh and again you found that you didn\u2019t have to fight the urge to tense or flee. \u201cThey like you, ya know?\"\u00a0 You smiled and leaned into him and he leaned down to you as you both held your own secret conversation.</p><p>\"You nervous about tonight, doll?\u201d You shook your head as he ran his thumb back and forth in soothing patterns on your thigh. \u201cSurprisingly, no. You\u2026I feel safe with you. Thank you for that.\u201d He fought a smile. \u201cEven though I keep fucking it up?\u201d You looked up at him and he had gotten even closer to your face with his breath was fanning your hair and making your heart pick up in speed. \u201cYou\u2019ve just tested my boundaries and pushed me out of my comfort zone. I\u2019m the one who keeps fucking up, Steve. You\u2026.you\u2019re..\u201d While finding your words you looked up at Sam, and he has his camera out on you and Steve and it gave you immediate unease so you felt a need to leave the room. You hastily made a near clumsy exit while Steve tried to figure out what happened.\u00a0</p><p>When his eyes found\u00a0 Sam, he gave him a stern look causing him to quickly apologized. He evidently meant no harm and just wanted a picture of you two to tease Cap later for going soft for a woman. You made off to your room and he was quick to follow but when you shut your door, he grabbed it and softly closed it behind him. \u201cTalk to me, Doll.\u201d You bit your lip and tried to control your breathing. \u201cWas Sam making fun of me? I..I know I\u2019m awkward with you but\u2026that\u2019s not kind at all.\u201d His face looked pained. \u201cHey we can be assholes at times, but we aren\u2019t mean-spirited. He was probably just taking it to tease me later about flirting with you.\"\u00a0 You gave him a sad smile. \"You promise me, Steve.\u201d He put his hand up to your cheek and his calloused thumb ran across your cheek, and you leaned into it as it sent shivers down your spine. \u201cI\u2019d promise you anything, doll. Just don\u2019t give up on me.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"340\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"asgardian-nightmare:kZe3VnyEHRD0DuX10OHEug:ZkgUip2BGhDS5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/958c45c02236c94dd1b8f3e93f4c8a38/tumblr_ocjjx4UejB1t300o2o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"340\"></figure><p>You stayed like that a moment, and you could feel the heat radiate off of his body and distinct scent.

He\u2019s the most honorable man I know, but the one thing I do know is that man will always follow his heart.\u201d With that, she left you with your thoughts and the knowledge that tonight would just bring both of you deeper into the rabbit hole.</p><p>Forever Tags</p><p>@mscaptainjones</p><p>@ssweet-empowerment</p><p>@shynara51</p><p>@loislp</p><p>@dragonselene</p><p>@frozenhuntress67</p><p>@shorteststories</p><p>@haru-ririchiyo</p><p>@<strike>fan</strike>-<strike>girlfanatix</strike></p><p>@sabr-n</p><p>@lost-and-wandering-alone</p><p>@hothornymetalkinkygirl</p><p>@kaelamarissa</p><p>@m-a-t-91</p><p>@whyyougottabesorudee</p><p>@you-be-mad-bitch</p><p>@goalie-love</p><p>@moodygrip</p><p>@myersge</p><p>@slytherin-in-hufflepuff-robes</p><p>@pvnk-bivch</p><p>@peaceinourtime82</p><p>@slytherinbratt</p><p>@<strike>just4muggles</strike></p><p>Steve Rogers</p><p>@patzammit @acupofhotlatte</p><p>@slytherinbratt</p><p>Bucky Barnes</p><p>@acupofhotlatte</p><p>@slytherinbratt</p></p>",

The things I\u2019ve said to you these past few days, I\u2019ve never said to anyone. I\u2019ve always been dutiful and what I\u2019m expected to be.

You are the last person that deserves that when so many other people are responsible for \u2026breaking me.\u201d Her voice gave out in the last part. I put my hand up to her face and he looked up into my eyes. \u201c I don\u2019t know why I bring out the fight in you but I will wear it like a fucking badge of honor because I love the fire in your eyes. I\u2019ve seen it more and more each day since I\u2019ve met you.\u201d I leaned in and kissed her food and she grabbed my biceps tightly like she might float away. Then just like that, she was gone.

You kept thinking of how much of fucked up mess you were in and trying to figure out how to get out of the rabbit hole. Steve kept thinking of how beautiful you were and how affected he was with you in his arms, of how his body was fighting the urge to go to you at every waking moment. The next day was what you called a free day until the evening for the Mayor\u2019s gala that you and the Captain would attend together. You thought that talking to him about your game plan would ease some of the tensions from the previous evening, or that was your hope.</p><p>When you came out, he was leaning against the counter and had made breakfast for the two of you. It was surreally domesticated and it took a moment to get your bearings. He was reading a newspaper and drinking coffee and smiled when he saw you come in, while drinking in your presence. \u201cGood morning. I-I hope that you don\u2019t mind. I made pancakes.\u201c You nodded and sat down across from him and pretended that you didn\u2019t notice him looking at you before he cleared his throat and went back to the paper.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"961\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cdf9c5317e2a72d546066c25611350/tumblr_pbwj5mf0jO1v3tw6c_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"961\"></figure><p>\"So..I have Sam and Bucky coming over today to go over a few things that I\u00a0 put together last night, I hope that you don't\u00a0mind.\u201d You shook your head and continued to eat. \u201cNo that\u2019s fine. What did you find?\u201d He smiled at you and put down\u00a0the paper. \u201cWell, thanks to you and your prodding I was able to figure out the possible whereabouts of some team players and the guys are bringing over some maps from the intel that you delivered. I think we can pinpoint the best HYRDA bases to infiltrate and take down first. Making the biggest impact and hit the hardest first.\u201d He looked so pleased, and his eyes were alight it made you excited and you couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cSpeaking of which, I have a person that I want to introduce you to tonight.\u201d He leaned forward and took a piece of bacon off of your plate, and you paused a moment but shook off the intimacy of the act. He was so casual about so many things and you knew that you and he lived in two very different worlds and it made your heart break a bit more.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYea, so tell me about this person.\u201d You snapped back to the topic at hand. \u201cHis name is Charles or Charlie. He is Vivian\u2019s main guard\u00a0detail. He wasn\u2019t there last night but he will certainly be there tonight. They are having an affair.\u201d Steve quirked an eyebrow and smirked at the gossip and you waved it off. \u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there. But he used to be my guard. He was here for 3 years and was head of security and ..he\u2019s a very good man.\u201d Steve looked down and his brows furrowed you saw his shoulder tense a bit. \u201cSo, why was he fired. Were you and he\u2026\u201d It took you a moment to realize the implication of how sounded to him. \u201cOh, no..of course not. I\u2019ve only ever been with him.\"\u00a0\u00a0You said with disgust and Steve gave you that\u00a0look to say that he was sorry and you felt a need to tell him what happened with Charlie to clear the air.\u00a0</p><p>\"Like I said Charlie was my detail and he\u00a0took me everywhere and we were..friends. Henry saw a picture of us in the paper and it made him look foolish. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if he would\u2019ve been mad if I slept with Charlie as long as it didn\u2019t appear that way to anyone else. To my luck, though I was pictured in a gossip column and I was laughing next to Charlie and Henry didn\u2019t like it. At all. Henry hit me. Charlie intervened and they threw punches. In the end, I did not fair well. Charlie ..he asked me to run away with him.\u201d Steve and you locked eyes and his jaw twitched.</p><p>\u201cHe loved you?\u201d You nodded. \u201cHe said he did but I didn\u2019t at least not like that, so I said no. Henry doesn\u2019t know about the offer . In the end,\u00a0 Henry was humiliated. Charlie was fired. Vivian found herself a new head of security as a favor to me. Which she still thanks me to this day.\u201d He reached over the table and gently took your hand and you didn\u2019t remove it as he gently rubbed his thumb in soothing circles. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, doll. I\u2013 didn\u2019t\u2026he\u2019ll pay.\u201d You looked up into his steel blue eyes and saw an unshakeable determination that gave you strength and you just nodded and gave him a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Charlie and I are still friends and if he thinks that you can help me \u2026I think he\u2019d give you whatever you\u2019d want. Especially if he thinks that you love me and will do whatever you can to get me out of here and take Henry down.\u201d Steve nodded ignoring the sour taste in his mouth. Henry had you and another man was in love with you and now you had his heart. He was used to fighting battles on the field but he didn\u2019t know how to navigate this and how to win you. He was lost and he wanted you more than anything and the desire was dripping from his tongue. He sighed and had to power through. \u201cEasy \u2018nough. Point him out tonight and I\u2019ll talk to him, K?\u201d You smiled knowing that you could count on him.</p><p>A few hours later you were surprisingly comfortable surrounded by Nat, Sam, Bucky, and Steve on your living room floor. Papers were everywhere and you and Nat were drinking some wine, and the guys had a beer. At first, you were wildly tense at this but then after Sam started in with being..well Sam, you loosened up and you were actually enjoying yourself.</p><p>You had found several solid leads on some bases now all of you were relaxing. \u201cWhat time do you have to get ready for the gala, Y/N?\u201d Nat spoke from behind her glass of wine. You rolled your eyes ever so slightly, used to being discreet in your rebellious actions but still divulging in them. \u201cI need to start getting reading in an hour at the latest.\u201d She smirked and volunteered to help you getting ready. You tried to decline but secretly liked the idea of having an actual friend to help, one without ulterior motives. At least you hoped she didn\u2019t but she was\u00a0a world-class spy\u00a0so you could never be sure. You risked a glance at Steve and knew that he could read you like a book and that you were letting your guard down having fun. He desperately wanted you to have fun and that was why he invited them over in part, genuine friends and family for you to be a part of.\u00a0</p><p>He came and sat next to you on the floor and nudged your shoulder. \"So you like these idiots of mine, huh?\u201d You shrugged and nodded. \u201cYou mean this ragtag bunch of heroes you got? Yea, they\u2019re not too bad.\u201d You laughed and he patted your jean-clad thigh and again you found that you didn\u2019t have to fight the urge to tense or flee. \u201cThey like you, ya know?\"\u00a0 You smiled and leaned into him and he leaned down to you as you both held your own secret conversation.</p><p>\"You nervous about tonight, doll?\u201d You shook your head as he ran his thumb back and forth in soothing patterns on your thigh. \u201cSurprisingly, no. You\u2026I feel safe with you. Thank you for that.\u201d He fought a smile. \u201cEven though I keep fucking it up?\u201d You looked up at him and he had gotten even closer to your face with his breath was fanning your hair and making your heart pick up in speed. \u201cYou\u2019ve just tested my boundaries and pushed me out of my comfort zone. I\u2019m the one who keeps fucking up, Steve. You\u2026.you\u2019re..\u201d While finding your words you looked up at Sam, and he has his camera out on you and Steve and it gave you immediate unease so you felt a need to leave the room. You hastily made a near clumsy exit while Steve tried to figure out what happened.\u00a0</p><p>When his eyes found\u00a0 Sam, he gave him a stern look causing him to quickly apologized. He evidently meant no harm and just wanted a picture of you two to tease Cap later for going soft for a woman. You made off to your room and he was quick to follow but when you shut your door, he grabbed it and softly closed it behind him. \u201cTalk to me, Doll.\u201d You bit your lip and tried to control your breathing. \u201cWas Sam making fun of me? I..I know I\u2019m awkward with you but\u2026that\u2019s not kind at all.\u201d His face looked pained. \u201cHey we can be assholes at times, but we aren\u2019t mean-spirited. He was probably just taking it to tease me later about flirting with you.\"\u00a0 You gave him a sad smile. \"You promise me, Steve.\u201d He put his hand up to your cheek and his calloused thumb ran across your cheek, and you leaned into it as it sent shivers down your spine. \u201cI\u2019d promise you anything, doll. Just don\u2019t give up on me.\u201d</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"340\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"asgardian-nightmare:kZe3VnyEHRD0DuX10OHEug:ZkgUip2BGhDS5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/958c45c02236c94dd1b8f3e93f4c8a38/tumblr_ocjjx4UejB1t300o2o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"340\"></figure><p>You stayed like that a moment, and you could feel the heat radiate off of his body and distinct scent. It was aftershave and leather. So simple and yet so masculine. His breathing deepened and then he ever so slowly took a step closer to you pulling you into his strong arms and held you tight. Not since Charlie had you been held. Even then you never honestly felt safe. His body engulfed your small frame, and his warmth encased you. \"I got you.\u201d After a moment you allowed yourself to wrap your arms around his waist and he rested his head on yours and you knew then that you were done for. This man was trying to fix you and for the first time in your dreary existence, you had hope.\u00a0 You looked up into his eyes. \u201cDoes anyone ever have you, Cap?\u201d He ran his hand over your lip and smiled. \u201cYou may not realize it, but you\u2019ve had me since I\u2019ve seen your fire.\u201d When he said that you felt the boldness come out. Knowing that he liked that bit of you that every other person always tried to stifle and put out.\u00a0</p><p>You kissed his thumb and heard him take a sharp breath and look up through your lashes to him. He leaned in and licked his plump bottom lip and kissed you. Finally, after what felt like an endless dance between you two, he was finally kissing you. The forbidden fruit.\u00a0 You had waited so many years to feel this all-encompassing passion and it was right here before you. You didn\u2019t want to focus on how wrong it was and how many ways wither of you could be hurt. Instead, you concentrated on the feel of his soft and warm lips on yours. The way his chest was pressed against yours as you struggled to breathe but refused to break away from the kiss, not wanting it to end. Your hand boldly traveled up his muscular chest and broad shoulder, resting in long soft locks of hair. As your nails, scratched his scalp he let out a delicious moan that sent waves of pleasure to your core that you\u2019ve never felt before. One of his hands held your face and the other gripped your hip firmly and pulled yours as close as possible to his powerful body. When you could no longer take the lack of oxygen you broke away and he pressed his forehead against yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWa\u2013was that ok, Doll?\u201d You didn\u2019t know what to say or what he was referring to. His performance? Offending you? \u201cSorry, Steve?\u201d You shook your head and looked into his ocean blues unsure of what he was asking. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to cross a line that you don\u2019t want me crossing? I - I don\u2019t want to fuck anything up with you.\u201d You thought he was back peddling and regretting the passionate kiss but were unsure. The desperate look in his eyes and the way they were on you told you one thing but your self-doubt was screaming another. Self-preservation kicked in and you took a step back and saw the disappointment in his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, Steve. You didn\u2019t cross any lines. ..I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here though.\u201d He stood there a moment. You weren\u2019t sure if he wanted to kiss you again or say something. Either you would be ok with but you\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t crave his kiss more than air.\u00a0 However, nothing came.\u00a0</p><p>Nat interrupted the silence with a knock on the door and Steve looked perturbed but let her in to help you get ready for the gala.\u00a0</p><p>_________________________________</p><p>You wee lost in thought and found that your fingers kept touching your lips where he kissed you, his lips still ghosting over them. His lingering taste and feel still burning you deliciously.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Y/N?\u201c You shook your head and came back to the moment. \"Nothing, thank you for getting me ready for tonight. Really not into it, you know.\u201d She nodded and waved a theatrical all done for you then plopped down in the closest chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI understand. You ok? I mean with all of this?\u201d You liked Nat, she was real and didn\u2019t put up with any shit from anyone. You could take a few notes from her. \u201cActually better than I thought I would be.\u201d She smiled a genuine smile. \u201cYea, Steve has a way about him.\u201d You pinched your brows together, did he do this a lot with women he helped? Were you just another. Nat picked up on your misunderstanding of the exchanged and casually went to clarify. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get close to people very often, but when he does, he\u2019s loyal to a fault. He will fight to the death for them and you can feel it all around you. The safety, the friendship, the total love. He and Bucky both will give you they\u2019re all. That\u2019s why I fell in love with Buck. He\u2019s a lot like Steve, just his darker half I suppose.\u201d She laughed to herself at an inside joke almost, and you couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u00a0\u00a0The thought of him laying his life down for you left a chill to your bones and settled terribly with you. You were scarred to your core for his well being, and you would gladly lay your life down for him if the occasion called for it. You were in over your head for the tall soldier.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"432\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c63a3282d48c8a3c7853fc7a229e2941/tumblr_pbwj5oYBWH1v3tw6c_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"432\"></figure><p>\u201cI-I know it\u2019s not my place, but it\u2019s ok to let your guard down with him.\u201d Your eyes shot up to hers.

He wouldn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d She stood up and turned the chair to have you face the mirror. You had simple makeup, and with retro waves reminiscent of a vintage era she finally spoke.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were given a raw deal sweetheart. You don\u2019t deserve the hand you\u2019ve been dealt and no one, not even God would want a wife to be abused by her husband. You will get out of this.\u201d She went to walk out of your room, and before she left, she turned back one last time. \u201cI\u2019ve known Steve a long time.

You thought that talking to him about your game plan would ease some of the tensions from the previous evening, or that was your hope.</p><p>When you came out, he was leaning against the counter and had made breakfast for the two of you. It was surreally domesticated and it took a moment to get your bearings. He was reading a newspaper and drinking coffee and smiled when he saw you come in, while drinking in your presence. &ldquo;Good morning. I-I hope that you don&rsquo;t mind. I made pancakes.&ldquo; You nodded and sat down across from him and pretended that you didn&rsquo;t notice him looking at you before he cleared his throat and went back to the paper.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40cdf9c5317e2a72d546066c25611350/tumblr_pbwj5mf0jO1v3tw6c_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\"So..I have Sam and Bucky coming over today to go over a few things that I&nbsp; put together last night, I hope that you don't&nbsp;mind.&rdquo; You shook your head and continued to eat. &ldquo;No that&rsquo;s fine. What did you find?&rdquo; He smiled at you and put down&nbsp;the paper. &ldquo;Well, thanks to you and your prodding I was able to figure out the possible whereabouts of some team players and the guys are bringing over some maps from the intel that you delivered. I think we can pinpoint the best HYRDA bases to infiltrate and take down first. Making the biggest impact and hit the hardest first.&rdquo; He looked so pleased, and his eyes were alight it made you excited and you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. &ldquo;Speaking of which, I have a person that I want to introduce you to tonight.&rdquo; He leaned forward and took a piece of bacon off of your plate, and you paused a moment but shook off the intimacy of the act. He was so casual about so many things and you knew that you and he lived in two very different worlds and it made your heart break a bit more.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, so tell me about this person.&rdquo; You snapped back to the topic at hand. &ldquo;His name is Charles or Charlie. He is Vivian&rsquo;s main guard&nbsp;detail. He wasn&rsquo;t there last night but he will certainly be there tonight. They are having an affair.&rdquo; Steve quirked an eyebrow and smirked at the gossip and you waved it off. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there. But he used to be my guard. He was here for 3 years and was head of security and ..he&rsquo;s a very good man.&rdquo; Steve looked down and his brows furrowed you saw his shoulder tense a bit. &ldquo;So, why was he fired. Were you and he&hellip;&rdquo; It took you a moment to realize the implication of how sounded to him. &ldquo;Oh, no..of course not. I&rsquo;ve only ever been with him.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;You said with disgust and Steve gave you that&nbsp;look to say that he was sorry and you felt a need to tell him what happened with Charlie to clear the air.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Like I said Charlie was my detail and he&nbsp;took me everywhere and we were..friends. Henry saw a picture of us in the paper and it made him look foolish. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know if he would&rsquo;ve been mad if I slept with Charlie as long as it didn&rsquo;t appear that way to anyone else. To my luck, though I was pictured in a gossip column and I was laughing next to Charlie and Henry didn&rsquo;t like it. At all. Henry hit me. Charlie intervened and they threw punches. In the end, I did not fair well. Charlie ..he asked me to run away with him.&rdquo; Steve and you locked eyes and his jaw twitched.</p><p>&ldquo;He loved you?&rdquo; You nodded. &ldquo;He said he did but I didn&rsquo;t at least not like that, so I said no. Henry doesn&rsquo;t know about the offer . In the end,&nbsp; Henry was humiliated. Charlie was fired. Vivian found herself a new head of security as a favor to me. Which she still thanks me to this day.&rdquo; He reached over the table and gently took your hand and you didn&rsquo;t remove it as he gently rubbed his thumb in soothing circles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry, doll. I&ndash; didn&rsquo;t&hellip;he&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo; You looked up into his steel blue eyes and saw an unshakeable determination that gave you strength and you just nodded and gave him a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, Charlie and I are still friends and if he thinks that you can help me &hellip;I think he&rsquo;d give you whatever you&rsquo;d want. Especially if he thinks that you love me and will do whatever you can to get me out of here and take Henry down.&rdquo; Steve nodded ignoring the sour taste in his mouth. Henry had you and another man was in love with you and now you had his heart. He was used to fighting battles on the field but he didn&rsquo;t know how to navigate this and how to win you. He was lost and he wanted you more than anything and the desire was dripping from his tongue. He sighed and had to power through. &ldquo;Easy &lsquo;nough. Point him out tonight and I&rsquo;ll talk to him, K?&rdquo; You smiled knowing that you could count on him.</p><p>A few hours later you were surprisingly comfortable surrounded by Nat, Sam, Bucky, and Steve on your living room floor. Papers were everywhere and you and Nat were drinking some wine, and the guys had a beer. At first, you were wildly tense at this but then after Sam started in with being..well Sam, you loosened up and you were actually enjoying yourself.</p><p>You had found several solid leads on some bases now all of you were relaxing. &ldquo;What time do you have to get ready for the gala, Y/N?&rdquo; Nat spoke from behind her glass of wine. You rolled your eyes ever so slightly, used to being discreet in your rebellious actions but still divulging in them. &ldquo;I need to start getting reading in an hour at the latest.&rdquo; She smirked and volunteered to help you getting ready. You tried to decline but secretly liked the idea of having an actual friend to help, one without ulterior motives. At least you hoped she didn&rsquo;t but she was&nbsp;a world-class spy&nbsp;so you could never be sure. You risked a glance at Steve and knew that he could read you like a book and that you were letting your guard down having fun. He desperately wanted you to have fun and that was why he invited them over in part, genuine friends and family for you to be a part of.&nbsp;</p><p>He came and sat next to you on the floor and nudged your shoulder. \"So you like these idiots of mine, huh?&rdquo; You shrugged and nodded. &ldquo;You mean this ragtag bunch of heroes you got? Yea, they&rsquo;re not too bad.&rdquo; You laughed and he patted your jean-clad thigh and again you found that you didn&rsquo;t have to fight the urge to tense or flee. &ldquo;They like you, ya know?\"&nbsp; You smiled and leaned into him and he leaned down to you as you both held your own secret conversation.</p><p>\"You nervous about tonight, doll?&rdquo; You shook your head as he ran his thumb back and forth in soothing patterns on your thigh. &ldquo;Surprisingly, no. You&hellip;I feel safe with you. Thank you for that.&rdquo; He fought a smile. &ldquo;Even though I keep fucking it up?&rdquo; You looked up at him and he had gotten even closer to your face with his breath was fanning your hair and making your heart pick up in speed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just tested my boundaries and pushed me out of my comfort zone. I&rsquo;m the one who keeps fucking up, Steve. You&hellip;.you&rsquo;re..&rdquo; While finding your words you looked up at Sam, and he has his camera out on you and Steve and it gave you immediate unease so you felt a need to leave the room. You hastily made a near clumsy exit while Steve tried to figure out what happened.&nbsp;</p><p>When his eyes found&nbsp; Sam, he gave him a stern look causing him to quickly apologized. He evidently meant no harm and just wanted a picture of you two to tease Cap later for going soft for a woman. You made off to your room and he was quick to follow but when you shut your door, he grabbed it and softly closed it behind him. &ldquo;Talk to me, Doll.&rdquo; You bit your lip and tried to control your breathing. &ldquo;Was Sam making fun of me? I..I know I&rsquo;m awkward with you but&hellip;that&rsquo;s not kind at all.&rdquo; His face looked pained. &ldquo;Hey we can be assholes at times, but we aren&rsquo;t mean-spirited. He was probably just taking it to tease me later about flirting with you.\"&nbsp; You gave him a sad smile. \"You promise me, Steve.&rdquo; He put his hand up to your cheek and his calloused thumb ran across your cheek, and you leaned into it as it sent shivers down your spine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d promise you anything, doll. Just don&rsquo;t give up on me.&rdquo;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You stayed like that a moment, and you could feel the heat radiate off of his body and distinct scent. It was aftershave and leather. So simple and yet so masculine. His breathing deepened and then he ever so slowly took a step closer to you pulling you into his strong arms and held you tight. Not since Charlie had you been held. Even then you never honestly felt safe. His body engulfed your small frame, and his warmth encased you. \"I got you.&rdquo; After a moment you allowed yourself to wrap your arms around his waist and he rested his head on yours and you knew then that you were done for. This man was trying to fix you and for the first time in your dreary existence, you had hope.&nbsp; You looked up into his eyes. &ldquo;Does anyone ever have you, Cap?&rdquo; He ran his hand over your lip and smiled. &ldquo;You may not realize it, but you&rsquo;ve had me since I&rsquo;ve seen your fire.&rdquo; When he said that you felt the boldness come out. Knowing that he liked that bit of you that every other person always tried to stifle and put out.&nbsp;</p><p>You kissed his thumb and heard him take a sharp breath and look up through your lashes to him. He leaned in and licked his plump bottom lip and kissed you. Finally, after what felt like an endless dance between you two, he was finally kissing you. The forbidden fruit.&nbsp; You had waited so many years to feel this all-encompassing passion and it was right here before you. You didn&rsquo;t want to focus on how wrong it was and how many ways wither of you could be hurt. Instead, you concentrated on the feel of his soft and warm lips on yours. The way his chest was pressed against yours as you struggled to breathe but refused to break away from the kiss, not wanting it to end. Your hand boldly traveled up his muscular chest and broad shoulder, resting in long soft locks of hair. As your nails, scratched his scalp he let out a delicious moan that sent waves of pleasure to your core that you&rsquo;ve never felt before. One of his hands held your face and the other gripped your hip firmly and pulled yours as close as possible to his powerful body. When you could no longer take the lack of oxygen you broke away and he pressed his forehead against yours.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wa&ndash;was that ok, Doll?&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t know what to say or what he was referring to. His performance? Offending you? &ldquo;Sorry, Steve?&rdquo; You shook your head and looked into his ocean blues unsure of what he was asking. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to cross a line that you don&rsquo;t want me crossing? I - I don&rsquo;t want to fuck anything up with you.&rdquo; You thought he was back peddling and regretting the passionate kiss but were unsure. The desperate look in his eyes and the way they were on you told you one thing but your self-doubt was screaming another. Self-preservation kicked in and you took a step back and saw the disappointment in his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Steve. You didn&rsquo;t cross any lines. ..I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing here though.&rdquo; He stood there a moment. You weren&rsquo;t sure if he wanted to kiss you again or say something. Either you would be ok with but you&rsquo;d be lying if you said you didn&rsquo;t crave his kiss more than air.&nbsp; However, nothing came.&nbsp;</p><p>Nat interrupted the silence with a knock on the door and Steve looked perturbed but let her in to help you get ready for the gala.&nbsp;</p><p>_________________________________</p><p>You wee lost in thought and found that your fingers kept touching your lips where he kissed you, his lips still ghosting over them. His lingering taste and feel still burning you deliciously.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind, Y/N?&ldquo; You shook your head and came back to the moment. \"Nothing, thank you for getting me ready for tonight. Really not into it, you know.&rdquo; She nodded and waved a theatrical all done for you then plopped down in the closest chair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand. You ok? I mean with all of this?&rdquo; You liked Nat, she was real and didn&rsquo;t put up with any shit from anyone. You could take a few notes from her. &ldquo;Actually better than I thought I would be.&rdquo; She smiled a genuine smile. &ldquo;Yea, Steve has a way about him.&rdquo; You pinched your brows together, did he do this a lot with women he helped? Were you just another. Nat picked up on your misunderstanding of the exchanged and casually went to clarify. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get close to people very often, but when he does, he&rsquo;s loyal to a fault. He will fight to the death for them and you can feel it all around you. The safety, the friendship, the total love. He and Bucky both will give you they&rsquo;re all. That&rsquo;s why I fell in love with Buck. He&rsquo;s a lot like Steve, just his darker half I suppose.&rdquo; She laughed to herself at an inside joke almost, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of him laying his life down for you left a chill to your bones and settled terribly with you. You were scarred to your core for his well being, and you would gladly lay your life down for him if the occasion called for it. You were in over your head for the tall soldier.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c63a3282d48c8a3c7853fc7a229e2941/tumblr_pbwj5oYBWH1v3tw6c_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;I-I know it&rsquo;s not my place, but it&rsquo;s ok to let your guard down with him.&rdquo; Your eyes shot up to hers. Was it that obvious to everyone? Hell, you didn&rsquo;t even know how you felt. What did you feel? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m married, Nat. A man like Steve. Honorable and from a different time. He wouldn&rsquo;t want&mdash;&rdquo; She stood up and turned the chair to have you face the mirror. You had simple makeup, and with retro waves reminiscent of a vintage era she finally spoke.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You were given a raw deal sweetheart. You don&rsquo;t deserve the hand you&rsquo;ve been dealt and no one, not even God would want a wife to be abused by her husband. You will get out of this.&rdquo; She went to walk out of your room, and before she left, she turned back one last time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known Steve a long time. He&rsquo;s the most honorable man I know, but the one thing I do know is that man will always follow his heart.&rdquo; With that, she left you with your thoughts and the knowledge that tonight would just bring both of you deeper into the rabbit hole.</p><p>Forever Tags</p><p>@mscaptainjones</p><p>@ssweet-empowerment</p><p>@shynara51</p><p>@loislp</p><p>@dragonselene</p><p>@frozenhuntress67</p><p>@shorteststories</p><p>@haru-ririchiyo</p><p>@<strike>fan</strike>-<strike>girlfanatix</strike></p><p>@sabr-n</p><p>@lost-and-wandering-alone</p><p>@hothornymetalkinkygirl</p><p>@kaelamarissa</p><p>@m-a-t-91</p><p>@whyyougottabesorudee</p><p>@you-be-mad-bitch</p><p>@goalie-love</p><p>@moodygrip</p><p>@myersge</p><p>@slytherin-in-hufflepuff-robes</p><p>@pvnk-bivch</p><p>@peaceinourtime82</p><p>@slytherinbratt</p><p>@<strike>just4muggles</strike></p><p>Steve Rogers</p><p>@patzammit @acupofhotlatte</p><p>@slytherinbratt</p><p>Bucky Barnes</p><p>@acupofhotlatte</p><p>@slytherinbratt</p></p>",
