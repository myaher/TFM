They're people who will offer you a shoulder to cry on, but they're also the people who might make you accidentally cry with a joke that they took too far. Gryffindors will fight for you, they'll give their lives for you, only, and I repeat, only if you'll do the same. The mutual trust that you have in each other cannot be broken.\nSlytherin: Slytherins are cunning and ambitious. To catch one's eye and become friends with one is a feat that is truly rewarding. Slytherins are masters at keeping secrets, so you better be sure that they will defend your secrets till the death, However, should you ever betray them, they will use all they know of you to twist and plot against you in the worst way possible. They will bring hell.\nRavenclaw: Ravenclaws are witty and smart. They look for people who can keep their thoughts and ideas going, and they look for people who can truly hold a conversation with them. They're a great source of advice, and being friends with a Ravenclaw can only ever have benefits.\nHufflepuffs: Amazing, great and caring friends, Hufflepuffs are people who you know are there for you. They will do everything in their power to make sure that their friends are happy, even if you might not do the same for them. Their biggest strength can be their greatest downfall, so make sure that you care about them as much as they care about you.",

        "body": "<p><i><b>Summary: </b>The daughter of Bellatrix and Rodopholus Lestrange is offered the opportunity to teach at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after training as a Healer since her graduation. Her past haunts her and she relies on her old Potions teacher for help but what will happen when they get too close for comfort? <br/></i></p><p><i><b>Rated: </b>E for graphic sex scenes in THIS and later chapters. Over 18\u2032s only please.<br/></i></p><p><i><b>Word Count: </b>4756</i></p><p><i>Multichapter Fic (Expected to be around 30-35 chapters with a planned sequel which will take place during the Harry Potter Books)</i></p><p><b>Chapter Nineteen \u2013 Playing House</b></p><p>The two were pulled away from the streets of London to a large working class town named Cokeworth. The cobblestone streets were lined with brick terraced houses that looked as though they had been copied and pasted a million times over to fill the streets. The street lights where the witch and wizard stood were out, prompting the man to pull out his wand and the tip lit up. He walked towards the house that stood in front of them and the woman followed closely behind.</p><p>Severus opened the door and the two entered, the floor creaking as it took their weight. He flicked his wand upwards, illuminating the room with a small oil lamp. They had entered directly into the living room which was decorated rather poorly and much like the street, it looked rather worn. Lyra\u2019s eyes were drawn to the walls first, there were stacks of books lining them all bound in leather. She wondered whether they were muggle or magical but she couldn\u2019t read them in the poor light. There was a small fireplace and in front of it sat an armchair, a sofa and a small coffee table.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no Malfoy Manor,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou said that about your quarters as well,\u201d Lyra commented.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should\u2019ve taken you there instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she dismissed, taking his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t come here often. Usually I stay at the school even over the break.\u201d</p><p>\u2018I can see why ,\u2019 she thought to herself. She sucked her lip in, trying to stop the words from spilling from her mouth. \u201cI appreciate you welcoming me into your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget that you\u2019re used to a life of luxury,\u201d he said, lazily he flicked his wand at the fireplace and pulled her towards the sofa. \u201cTake a seat, I have more wine.\u201d</p><p>She let the comment slide by and simply followed his instruction; waiting for the wizard to return with two large goblets in hand. He passed one to Lyra and sat next to her. She smiled in thanks before their eyes both focused on the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like growing up here?\u201d she asked, breaking the silence between them. She noticed his jaw tense at the topic and immediately scolded herself for asking. It was obvious that he had a difficult home life and she just had to reopen those wounds. She pulled his hand into hers and apologised. \u201cSorry, you don\u2019t have to answer.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cIt was hard, Lyra. We struggled.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and looked at him while his eyes reflected the flames of the fire. She longed to know what was going on in that head of his but she didn\u2019t know Legilimency so instead she put her glass down and that hand met the other to hold his in an affectionate manner. The gesture managed to pull him from his memories and look over to her.</p><p>Her eyes were full of warmth and understanding. Her touch was full of care. Severus could tell that Lyra genuinely cared for him and he felt comfortable enough to continue. \u201cMy parents would fight all the time. It was mainly yelling but it escalated, soon he threw things out of anger and then it was him hitting her. I tried to intervene at times but I was only a boy. My mother knew magic but she didn\u2019t protect herself, she didn\u2019t protect me. I tried my best to protect her when I could but I wasn\u2019t there when it was at its worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother could\u2019ve had everything, she could\u2019ve had a better life but she tossed it all away from him and I don\u2019t understand why. She was a pureblood and she left her family and fortune behind for my father just to live like a muggle and to die at his hands.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met Lyra\u2019s again and he felt his heart sink, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be like her and I don\u2019t want to be like him. I don\u2019t want you to throw away all you have for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she said, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my mother loved him too but things change, Lyra,\u201d his voice began to escalate. He tried to pull away but Lyra\u2019s hands kept a firm grip on his.</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not your father. You\u2019re nothing like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know him, you don\u2019t know how I\u2019m like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said in a soft tone. She looked at him, her head tilted to the side with a warm, encouraging smile. She began to speak again when his eyes drifted back to her. \u201cSev, you can always change. People look at me and see my mother and father, and while I do look an awful lot like them and I can be just as cruel, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to be. We can change our future.\u201d</p><p>He looked away again. He couldn\u2019t stand staring into those brown eyes. They were so full of love and affection, he could dive in and get lost in the love that she had for him but he was scared. His doubt would weigh him down and he\u2019d find himself drowning if he didn\u2019t try to keep himself out. It was just too much.</p><p>Severus wanted to believe those words. She made everything sound so sweet and simple. He knew she wasn\u2019t naive but it was so hard to think that maybe she was right. He had been stuck in the same pattern of thinking for years, distancing himself from others, telling himself that he was inadequate and unworthy of love but Lyra made a small part of himself believe that maybe he could be worthy of her affection.</p><p>\u201cI killed him,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t know what made him admit it. He felt the truth weigh on him a million times before but he had never voiced it before. Maybe he hoped it would drive her away but it didn\u2019t. Her eyes remained warm and kind even at the face of the evil he had committed. \u201cThe Dark Lord wanted me to prove my loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you feel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was easy,\u201d he replied. All the tension in his face was gone but his look had a hint of disgust, almost as though he hated himself for thinking that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never killed anyone before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try to keep it that way,\u201d he said, \u201cOnce you tear your soul like that there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I never have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day you might have to. What will you do if the Dark Lord returns?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard before reaching for her wine. After a sip she spoke, \u201cWhen I was younger I was convinced that he would return and I\u2019d be reunited with my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recall.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the memory of her youth but her face dropped as she continued. \u201cBack then I was convinced I\u2019d join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her face against the goblet, almost to hide her face. She exhaled deeply before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe he\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. I haven\u2019t allowed my mind to dwell on it for too long, I\u2019d just tell myself that he won\u2019t, that it\u2019s been ten years and there\u2019s no sign of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbus told me there have been whispers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere always have been, you were there when the inner circle wanted to bring him back. Even my mother told me seek him out when I became of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She scratched the back of her neck in frustration, \u201cBecause I decided to stop pursuing the Dark Arts and I just didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scared, you still are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, \u201cWhere will your loyalties lie when he returns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to be scared of,\u201d his tone was venomous and threatening, cautioning Lyra to back off of the subject.</p><p>She smiled at the ferocity of his words. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Despite her outward appearance, relishing in the moment her heart ached. She wanted to shatter and cry at the knife in her chest so she looked away. Severus didn\u2019t answer her statement, instead he continued to stare at the flames as he took a deep sip of his wine. Lyra too drank, allowing the tension to hang between them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to trust me,\u201d she said sadly after a few moments, \u201cIt\u2019d be naive to and I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a bit disappointed but I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said, \u201cHe\u2019ll use these memories as a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to learn Occlumency again,\u201d he said, \u201cWe never finished our lessons.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and threw back the rest of her wine. She sunk back into the chair and allowed the warmth of the fireplace and the alcohol pumping through her veins lull her to sleep.</p><p>Severus sighed to himself upon the observation that the witch had fallen asleep. He reached out and touched her, hoping that it would wake her but instead her wrapped around his own and held on tightly. Her unconscious gesture tugged at his heart and internally he admonished himself.</p><p>Falling in love with Lyra was a mistake. Placing himself in the position to was a mistake. It was so blatantly obvious to him in that moment that their whole relationship was destined to fail from the start but for some unknown reason he had allowed himself to be whisked away on this turbulent romance and now she was here, where no other woman had been in his childhood home, sleeping on his couch.</p><p>He convinced himself it was just the sex. That he didn\u2019t really love her but her body. Her lips, her touch, her sweet pussy wrapped around him. The flush that would appear across her cheeks whenever he said something vulgar. Even when he was reminding himself of those times of passion he could feel his cock stir but his head must\u2019ve got the messages mixed up because he felt his heart beating out of his chest as well.</p><p>He loved her. There was no denying it.</p><p>At the mere mention of her name he could picture her face smiling up at him and his heart would tug slightly. He\u2019d even hear her sing out his name. Sev. Severus. Gods, how sweet and safe did it sound in her mouth.</p><p>He could fall deeper and deeper in love with her, just at the thought of her.</p><p>It was problematic, to say the least. Even Albus himself had asked about the nature of their relationship after seeing that they had spent a great deal of time together. He had discouraged it completely, particularly after sharing information about the Dark Lord\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cSeverus, it had come to my knowledge that a piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul has been residing in Albania,\u201d Albus said as he sat at his desk. \u201cSoon, the time will come where I will have to ask you to spy for the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Severus replied.</p><p>\u201cI am, however, apprehensive about the nature of your relationship with Professor Lestrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Lyra seem to be rather\u2026 close.\u201d</p><p>Severus remained silent, allowing Albus to continue.</p><p>\u201cIt worries me, Severus,\u201d he said shaking his head, searching deep in his eyes. Severus\u2019 mind was shielded well from the effects of Albus\u2019 Legilimency. \u201cAs good hearted as Lyra is, I fear that when the time comes to it she will side with her family and I don\u2019t want you divulging all our secrets to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Severus replied.</p><p>\u201cAh, but Severus you are in love with her and love is a fickle thing.\u201d</p><p>Severus didn\u2019t believe that their love was fickle, he felt as though it was constant it was just the feelings and circumstances around it that changed. He felt as though if there weren\u2019t so many external pressures maybe they\u2019d have a chance together. He knew it was wishful thinking because the issue was no longer the fact that she was the niece of his close friend or that she was the pureblood daughter of two the sacred 28. It was the fact that the Dark Lord would return and her entire family were loyal to him and if they were loyal she would be too.</p><p>Where would she hold her loyalty to him?</p><p>Would their bond of love override what she had with her family?</p><p>No. Probably not. Severus knew this and it was a difficult pill to swallow. He couldn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>There was a part of his mind that hoped that Lyra was right, that the rumours of Voldemort\u2019s existence were just rumours with no substance but Albus had been adamant that they were true. He just wanted his relationship with Lyra to work out. No one could compare to her. She was beautiful and sweet, kind-hearted and intelligent.</p><p>He thought for a moment whether or not if he had fallen for another woman that was separate from the Death Eaters whether or not it would work out. No, she too would be used against him in the same way Lyra would be. At least Lyra had a fighting chance, he could train her to protect their memories of them together because now not only was she his weakness but he knew that he would be hers as well. Occlumency lessons seemed to be the way to go. It would allow him to see what she truly felt about her as well as give her a chance to stand up to the Dark Lord if it came down to it.</p><p>Slowly, he finished his glass as his mind continued to whir about the future. He set down the now empty glass and placed a free hand on her back to gently rouse her from her sleep. He guided the witch in her half-asleep state up the stairs and into his bedroom. His worries faded as quickly as she had shed her clothes, lust overcame the thoughts in his head. She slipped under the covers, dressed only in her underwear and once hidden she undid her bra and dropped it onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to maintain your modesty now?\u201d he asked as he slid into bed with her.</p><p>\u201cYou might see my breasts and want to shag me,\u201d she said as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but cup her breasts that she had just freed. His erection was obvious, already poking her backside. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She moaned as his fingers pinched her nipples and his mouth found its way over the marks he had left the night prior. \u201cLyra,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI just want you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Sev,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he hummed against her skin.</p><p>She moaned in agreement, her hips grinding back against his member.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve warned you about grinding on my cock before,\u201d he breathed, tugging on her nipples a bit more roughly.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tie me up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might just have to spank you instead,\u201d he said, \u201cDon\u2019t think you learned your lesson the first time.\u201d He could hear her swallow at the thought. \u201cI could get you so worked up with my words, couldn\u2019t I? I could tell you how I\u2019d bend you over my lap and spank you until your bum is red and you could probably come at the mere thought. Who knew I had such a dirty girl on my hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she breathed, getting worked up from the simultaneous stimulation of her mind and her nipples. There was a coil of heat building in her stomach that she just knew was causing arousal to pool between her legs.</p><p>\u201cYes, my love,\u201d he said.</p><p>That endearing nickname gave her butterflies everytime he said it. It made it so much harder for her to get her words out. \u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be patient,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to be begging for me to fuck you before I let my cock anywhere near your cunt.\u201d</p><p>He knew every button push to have her writhing in his arms. His hand dipped down and slid underneath her panties, rubbing around her clitoris. Desperate high pitched moans escaped her as he just kept circling the swollen nub whilst pulling at her sensitive nipples.</p><p>A fire was raging in her core, hot flames licked at her clit as it became overbearingly sensitive. She strained against his touch almost as though she was trying to get away from it but god, did she love the pleasure it brought.</p><p>Severus didn\u2019t even need to check whether or not she was wet. He could feel it flooding her panties to the point where his fingers were coated in her juices despite not navigating anywhere near her aching hole. Squeals began to build in her throat as the stimulation of her clitoris continued.</p><p>He left it alone and pushed a single digit into her soaked entrance and wiggled it around before leaving it there unmoving. Her hips began to buck up into his hand and he could feel her pussy twitch and squeeze around it, desperate for her release. A few more thrusts from the girl against his steady hand and she came hard around the finger, the walls pulsing tightly around it.</p><p>\u201cDid I say you could come?\u201d he asked in a threatening tone. Her pussy clenched again at the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d she said, her voice weak and wavering from her orgasm.</p><p>His cock twitched at her address. They hadn\u2019t formally discussed any dominant/submissive agreement but it was obvious that she enjoyed playing with the idea. \u201cI\u2019ll have to punish you for that, my love.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps covered her skin. She didn\u2019t know if it was from Severus\u2019 nickname for her or because he had pulled the blankets off, exposing her skin to the cool air. She moaned in agreement and he pulled his finger out, bringing it up to her lips and allowing her to suck her juices off. \u201cI want you face down, ass up,\u201d he said.</p><p>She followed his instruction and felt his hands pull her underwear off. She then felt the material being used to mop up her arousal and then slowly be pushed into her pussy. Her heart raced at the thought, \u2018Gods, how humiliating.\u2019Her stomach was doing backflips in apprehension of what was about to come.</p><p>His hand started to caress her backside, appreciating the natural curves. A finger slid down between the cheeks, lingering and circling around her puckered asshole. Severus raised his hand and brought it down onto her right cheek.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d she exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>He did the same again, this time on the left and this time she moaned out. He was cautious as he continued, wanting to turn her plump ass red but also not wanting it to hurt too much but he couldn\u2019t help it. Each one of his harder slaps caused her to moan out. He persisted with the slaps until her cheeks were a nice pink colour.</p><p>He shifted around and kissed the now tender skin. He lay kisses all around before kissing the tight star. He allowed his lips to remain there longer than the other kisses. His tongue darted out and Lyra was surprised at the intrusion.</p><p>Her eyes were shut tightly, focusing on the feeling of his tongue flicking at the hole. As she relaxed into it she found that she enjoyed it, it wasn\u2019t a feeling that she could get off to but the thought that her lover was taking pleasure in appreciating every inch of her was nice. He definitely seemed to be enjoying it, showing great enthusiasm during the act.</p><p>It was now Severus\u2019 time for pleasure, he pulled her panties out and pressed them against her mouth. Hesitantly she took the soaked garment into her mouth and felt Severus\u2019 cock pressing at her entrance. It was obvious she was too dry to take him in so to warm her back he sucked on his thumb briefly before pressing it against the puckered hole he had been appreciating only a few minutes before.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s asshole gave way easily to the thick digit and she let out a muffled moan. He wiggled his thumb around, even pulling it out slightly before pressing it back in. Lyra\u2019s hips thrust back into the movements, wanting more friction. Severus pressed the tip of his cock at her entrance once more, feeling that it was slick with her arousal again he pressed in.</p><p>She gasped at the feeling of his length slowly sliding in and filling her. One hand gripped her hips as he pumped in and out, occasionally pressing his thumb down to stimulate his erection. He groaned at the stimulation, her walls contracting around him as he fucked her.</p><p>Lyra reached down, pressing her face into the mattress to try and get leverage on her clit. She rubbed it fast as Severus pounded her from behind. She screamed as she came, her underwear still stuffed in her mouth absorbing the sound.</p><p>He continued the steady rhythm. In and out of her pulsing pussy. He reached down and removed her panties, discarding them so she could breathe. Her lips were pressed together tightly, she was humming a song of pleasure as he hammered her.</p><p>She flicked her bean once more, desperate to come again. Her pussy was so wet she could hear him sliding in and out of her. She groaned in a mixture of embarrassment and pleasure, her cunt twitching again as she neared release.</p><p>\u201cWait for me,\u201d he said, speeding up his pace.</p><p>His movements were purposeful and hard. Each thrust reaching deep inside her. He could feel her quaking around him, trying to stave off her orgasm. Her fingers left her clitoris, instead desperately gripping the bed sheets in an attempt to keep herself upright and bracing herself from his onslaught. She tried to resist, yet despite the decreased stimulation she came hard once more with an exasperated moan.</p><p>She shuddered, her body twitching under him, wanting to give way. The walls around Severus\u2019 cock were milking him and with a few more thrusts he came deep inside her. He rolled to the side as Lyra\u2019s body collapsed onto the bed.</p><p>He pulled her close once more, their bodies covered in a sheen of sweat. Lyra was panting but soon her breathing steadied and the two surrendered to sleep.</p><p>The morning after was filled with peppered kisses. Lyra had awoken before Severus and unleashed her love on the man\u2019s exposed body. He awoke with a smile, happy to see his love laying in bed with him.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Sevvy,\u201d she said, pecking him on the lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re usually never this affectionate when you wake up,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to wake up with you lying next to me every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes lit up, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can use the floo to go between our rooms,\u201d he said.</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded, \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>He hummed in agreeance, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>The pair remained in bed together until they decided it was time to get up. After searching through the bare and dirty cupboard in the Snape House she decided to quickly apparate to Diagon Alley for a few supplies. She was back after a few minutes, a few eggs and bacon in tow. Lyra pulled out her wand and began to make breakfast.</p><p>\u201cDid Narcissa teach you how to cook too?\u201d he asked, watching on from the table.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cI also learnt a few tricks from Uncle Ted and Aunt Andy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Tonks\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I stopped by for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows were raised, \u201cDo Lucius and Narcissa know?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cThey\u2019d throw me to the curb if they knew. I only saw them just the once but they were nice. The sisters are still very bitter about everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>Severus felt enlightened by the new addition of information. Maybe there was still hope to sway Lyra onto the Order\u2019s side if she still looked to her mother\u2019s estranged sister as family.</p><p>She came and sat down next to him, serving the simple breakfast of bacon and eggs. For some reason it tasted better than anything he had ever eaten before. Maybe it was the company that was present, maybe it was because she made it, maybe she had spiked it with love potion. These were just theories going through Severus\u2019 head as he watched her as she flicked through the copy of the Daily Prophet she had picked up that morning.</p><p>\u201cGustav is going to be meeting me in Hogsmeade for an interview,\u201d she said, \u201cIn about an hour or so. Then I\u2019ve got to write my paper and send it off to be published.\u201d</p><p>Severus nodded, his heart sinking a little. He had hoped that he would have the opportunity to spend the whole weekend with her but he did enjoy the day they had together. Once they finished eating they apparated into Hogsmeade and killed some time browsing the shops. As it inched closer to the meeting time, the two made their way to the Three Broomsticks.</p><p>Gustav was early, he was wrapped up in a brown winter coat, complimented by a red scarf. He beamed at Lyra, waving at her as he made his way over.</p><p>\u201cLyra!\u201d he said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cGustav!\u201d she pulled him into a hug. When separating she introduced her to Severus. \u201cThis is my friend, Severus. He teaches Potions at Hogwarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d Gustav repeated, offering him a hand. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Severus gave a curt nod to the man whilst taking his hand. \u201cI will take this opportunity to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Lyra asked with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have to prepare for my classes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lyra frowned, \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d stay, I mean you helped me with the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your brilliant mind that did all the work,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d she sighed, pulling him into a hug. \u201cYou better come around tonight or I\u2019ll be knocking down your door.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and left.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Gustav asked.</p><p>Lyra smiled, exhaling a small laugh. She shook her head, \u201cWe\u2019re just colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd Syrin is just my housemate.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cCan I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust firewhisky thanks,\u201d he replied as he took a seat.</p><p>Lyra returned with two drinks in hand and he prompted her to go on a detailed spiel about the research she had carried out from start to finish. Once he had enough information for the article the two relaxed and began to chat.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the wedding planning going?\u201d Lyra asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve had to push it forward a bit,\u201d Gustav replied, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be April 20th.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow, that\u2019s like two months away,\u201d Lyra commented, \u201cThat\u2019s not much time to get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, um, Syrin is pregnant,\u201d Gustav said.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d she said excitedly pulling Gustav into a hug.</p><p>He gave a sheepish laugh, \u201cYeah, a bit of a surprise really but you can\u2019t help these things. We weren\u2019t planning on having kids for a while. It sort of screws up plans for Syrin career wise.\u201d Lyra frowned. \u201cBut this article with you should be big,\u201d he continued, \u201cI really appreciate you asking me to cover it. I think it\u2019ll pay well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problems,\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the idiot they sent from the Prophet. She started interviewing the wrong person then was shocked when she found out I was the one who discovered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only the worst journalist in Britain,\u201d he laughed, \u201cYet somehow she\u2019s the most famous. I don\u2019t know how anyone reads anything she writes, it rarely has any substance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt she\u2019ll try and spin some bullshit story out of our interaction,\u201d Lyra groaned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress too much,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll make you sound like an angel.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI know it\u2019s a difficult task but no one is as good as you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her compliment, \u201cThanks Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you pump out the article before she does,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I will,\u201d Gustav said, slinging back the rest of his firewhiskey.</p>",

Lyra\u2019s eyes were drawn to the walls first, there were stacks of books lining them all bound in leather. She wondered whether they were muggle or magical but she couldn\u2019t read them in the poor light. There was a small fireplace and in front of it sat an armchair, a sofa and a small coffee table.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no Malfoy Manor,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou said that about your quarters as well,\u201d Lyra commented.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should\u2019ve taken you there instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she dismissed, taking his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t come here often. Usually I stay at the school even over the break.\u201d</p><p>\u2018I can see why ,\u2019 she thought to herself. She sucked her lip in, trying to stop the words from spilling from her mouth. \u201cI appreciate you welcoming me into your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget that you\u2019re used to a life of luxury,\u201d he said, lazily he flicked his wand at the fireplace and pulled her towards the sofa. \u201cTake a seat, I have more wine.\u201d</p><p>She let the comment slide by and simply followed his instruction; waiting for the wizard to return with two large goblets in hand. He passed one to Lyra and sat next to her. She smiled in thanks before their eyes both focused on the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like growing up here?\u201d she asked, breaking the silence between them. She noticed his jaw tense at the topic and immediately scolded herself for asking. It was obvious that he had a difficult home life and she just had to reopen those wounds. She pulled his hand into hers and apologised. \u201cSorry, you don\u2019t have to answer.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cIt was hard, Lyra. We struggled.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and looked at him while his eyes reflected the flames of the fire. She longed to know what was going on in that head of his but she didn\u2019t know Legilimency so instead she put her glass down and that hand met the other to hold his in an affectionate manner. The gesture managed to pull him from his memories and look over to her.</p><p>Her eyes were full of warmth and understanding. Her touch was full of care. Severus could tell that Lyra genuinely cared for him and he felt comfortable enough to continue. \u201cMy parents would fight all the time. It was mainly yelling but it escalated, soon he threw things out of anger and then it was him hitting her. I tried to intervene at times but I was only a boy. My mother knew magic but she didn\u2019t protect herself, she didn\u2019t protect me. I tried my best to protect her when I could but I wasn\u2019t there when it was at its worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother could\u2019ve had everything, she could\u2019ve had a better life but she tossed it all away from him and I don\u2019t understand why. She was a pureblood and she left her family and fortune behind for my father just to live like a muggle and to die at his hands.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met Lyra\u2019s again and he felt his heart sink, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be like her and I don\u2019t want to be like him. I don\u2019t want you to throw away all you have for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she said, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my mother loved him too but things change, Lyra,\u201d his voice began to escalate. He tried to pull away but Lyra\u2019s hands kept a firm grip on his.</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not your father. You\u2019re nothing like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know him, you don\u2019t know how I\u2019m like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said in a soft tone. She looked at him, her head tilted to the side with a warm, encouraging smile. She began to speak again when his eyes drifted back to her. \u201cSev, you can always change. People look at me and see my mother and father, and while I do look an awful lot like them and I can be just as cruel, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to be. We can change our future.\u201d</p><p>He looked away again. He couldn\u2019t stand staring into those brown eyes. They were so full of love and affection, he could dive in and get lost in the love that she had for him but he was scared. His doubt would weigh him down and he\u2019d find himself drowning if he didn\u2019t try to keep himself out. It was just too much.</p><p>Severus wanted to believe those words. She made everything sound so sweet and simple. He knew she wasn\u2019t naive but it was so hard to think that maybe she was right. He had been stuck in the same pattern of thinking for years, distancing himself from others, telling himself that he was inadequate and unworthy of love but Lyra made a small part of himself believe that maybe he could be worthy of her affection.</p><p>\u201cI killed him,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t know what made him admit it. He felt the truth weigh on him a million times before but he had never voiced it before. Maybe he hoped it would drive her away but it didn\u2019t. Her eyes remained warm and kind even at the face of the evil he had committed. \u201cThe Dark Lord wanted me to prove my loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you feel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was easy,\u201d he replied. All the tension in his face was gone but his look had a hint of disgust, almost as though he hated himself for thinking that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never killed anyone before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try to keep it that way,\u201d he said, \u201cOnce you tear your soul like that there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I never have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day you might have to. What will you do if the Dark Lord returns?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard before reaching for her wine. After a sip she spoke, \u201cWhen I was younger I was convinced that he would return and I\u2019d be reunited with my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recall.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the memory of her youth but her face dropped as she continued. \u201cBack then I was convinced I\u2019d join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her face against the goblet, almost to hide her face. She exhaled deeply before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe he\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. I haven\u2019t allowed my mind to dwell on it for too long, I\u2019d just tell myself that he won\u2019t, that it\u2019s been ten years and there\u2019s no sign of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbus told me there have been whispers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere always have been, you were there when the inner circle wanted to bring him back. Even my mother told me seek him out when I became of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She scratched the back of her neck in frustration, \u201cBecause I decided to stop pursuing the Dark Arts and I just didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scared, you still are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, \u201cWhere will your loyalties lie when he returns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to be scared of,\u201d his tone was venomous and threatening, cautioning Lyra to back off of the subject.</p><p>She smiled at the ferocity of his words. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Despite her outward appearance, relishing in the moment her heart ached. She wanted to shatter and cry at the knife in her chest so she looked away. Severus didn\u2019t answer her statement, instead he continued to stare at the flames as he took a deep sip of his wine. Lyra too drank, allowing the tension to hang between them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to trust me,\u201d she said sadly after a few moments, \u201cIt\u2019d be naive to and I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a bit disappointed but I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said, \u201cHe\u2019ll use these memories as a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to learn Occlumency again,\u201d he said, \u201cWe never finished our lessons.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and threw back the rest of her wine. She sunk back into the chair and allowed the warmth of the fireplace and the alcohol pumping through her veins lull her to sleep.</p><p>Severus sighed to himself upon the observation that the witch had fallen asleep. He reached out and touched her, hoping that it would wake her but instead her wrapped around his own and held on tightly. Her unconscious gesture tugged at his heart and internally he admonished himself.</p><p>Falling in love with Lyra was a mistake. Placing himself in the position to was a mistake. It was so blatantly obvious to him in that moment that their whole relationship was destined to fail from the start but for some unknown reason he had allowed himself to be whisked away on this turbulent romance and now she was here, where no other woman had been in his childhood home, sleeping on his couch.</p><p>He convinced himself it was just the sex. That he didn\u2019t really love her but her body. Her lips, her touch, her sweet pussy wrapped around him. The flush that would appear across her cheeks whenever he said something vulgar. Even when he was reminding himself of those times of passion he could feel his cock stir but his head must\u2019ve got the messages mixed up because he felt his heart beating out of his chest as well.</p><p>He loved her. There was no denying it.</p><p>At the mere mention of her name he could picture her face smiling up at him and his heart would tug slightly. He\u2019d even hear her sing out his name. Sev. Severus. Gods, how sweet and safe did it sound in her mouth.</p><p>He could fall deeper and deeper in love with her, just at the thought of her.</p><p>It was problematic, to say the least. Even Albus himself had asked about the nature of their relationship after seeing that they had spent a great deal of time together. He had discouraged it completely, particularly after sharing information about the Dark Lord\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cSeverus, it had come to my knowledge that a piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul has been residing in Albania,\u201d Albus said as he sat at his desk. \u201cSoon, the time will come where I will have to ask you to spy for the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Severus replied.</p><p>\u201cI am, however, apprehensive about the nature of your relationship with Professor Lestrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Lyra seem to be rather\u2026 close.\u201d</p><p>Severus remained silent, allowing Albus to continue.</p><p>\u201cIt worries me, Severus,\u201d he said shaking his head, searching deep in his eyes. Severus\u2019 mind was shielded well from the effects of Albus\u2019 Legilimency. \u201cAs good hearted as Lyra is, I fear that when the time comes to it she will side with her family and I don\u2019t want you divulging all our secrets to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Severus replied.</p><p>\u201cAh, but Severus you are in love with her and love is a fickle thing.\u201d</p><p>Severus didn\u2019t believe that their love was fickle, he felt as though it was constant it was just the feelings and circumstances around it that changed. He felt as though if there weren\u2019t so many external pressures maybe they\u2019d have a chance together. He knew it was wishful thinking because the issue was no longer the fact that she was the niece of his close friend or that she was the pureblood daughter of two the sacred 28. It was the fact that the Dark Lord would return and her entire family were loyal to him and if they were loyal she would be too.</p><p>Where would she hold her loyalty to him?</p><p>Would their bond of love override what she had with her family?</p><p>No. Probably not. Severus knew this and it was a difficult pill to swallow. He couldn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>There was a part of his mind that hoped that Lyra was right, that the rumours of Voldemort\u2019s existence were just rumours with no substance but Albus had been adamant that they were true. He just wanted his relationship with Lyra to work out. No one could compare to her. She was beautiful and sweet, kind-hearted and intelligent.</p><p>He thought for a moment whether or not if he had fallen for another woman that was separate from the Death Eaters whether or not it would work out. No, she too would be used against him in the same way Lyra would be. At least Lyra had a fighting chance, he could train her to protect their memories of them together because now not only was she his weakness but he knew that he would be hers as well. Occlumency lessons seemed to be the way to go. It would allow him to see what she truly felt about her as well as give her a chance to stand up to the Dark Lord if it came down to it.</p><p>Slowly, he finished his glass as his mind continued to whir about the future. He set down the now empty glass and placed a free hand on her back to gently rouse her from her sleep. He guided the witch in her half-asleep state up the stairs and into his bedroom. His worries faded as quickly as she had shed her clothes, lust overcame the thoughts in his head. She slipped under the covers, dressed only in her underwear and once hidden she undid her bra and dropped it onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to maintain your modesty now?\u201d he asked as he slid into bed with her.</p><p>\u201cYou might see my breasts and want to shag me,\u201d she said as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but cup her breasts that she had just freed. His erection was obvious, already poking her backside. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She moaned as his fingers pinched her nipples and his mouth found its way over the marks he had left the night prior. \u201cLyra,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI just want you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Sev,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he hummed against her skin.</p><p>She moaned in agreement, her hips grinding back against his member.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve warned you about grinding on my cock before,\u201d he breathed, tugging on her nipples a bit more roughly.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tie me up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might just have to spank you instead,\u201d he said, \u201cDon\u2019t think you learned your lesson the first time.\u201d He could hear her swallow at the thought. \u201cI could get you so worked up with my words, couldn\u2019t I? I could tell you how I\u2019d bend you over my lap and spank you until your bum is red and you could probably come at the mere thought. Who knew I had such a dirty girl on my hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she breathed, getting worked up from the simultaneous stimulation of her mind and her nipples. There was a coil of heat building in her stomach that she just knew was causing arousal to pool between her legs.</p><p>\u201cYes, my love,\u201d he said.</p><p>That endearing nickname gave her butterflies everytime he said it. It made it so much harder for her to get her words out. \u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be patient,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to be begging for me to fuck you before I let my cock anywhere near your cunt.\u201d</p><p>He knew every button push to have her writhing in his arms. His hand dipped down and slid underneath her panties, rubbing around her clitoris. Desperate high pitched moans escaped her as he just kept circling the swollen nub whilst pulling at her sensitive nipples.</p><p>A fire was raging in her core, hot flames licked at her clit as it became overbearingly sensitive. She strained against his touch almost as though she was trying to get away from it but god, did she love the pleasure it brought.</p><p>Severus didn\u2019t even need to check whether or not she was wet. He could feel it flooding her panties to the point where his fingers were coated in her juices despite not navigating anywhere near her aching hole. Squeals began to build in her throat as the stimulation of her clitoris continued.</p><p>He left it alone and pushed a single digit into her soaked entrance and wiggled it around before leaving it there unmoving. Her hips began to buck up into his hand and he could feel her pussy twitch and squeeze around it, desperate for her release. A few more thrusts from the girl against his steady hand and she came hard around the finger, the walls pulsing tightly around it.</p><p>\u201cDid I say you could come?\u201d he asked in a threatening tone. Her pussy clenched again at the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d she said, her voice weak and wavering from her orgasm.</p><p>His cock twitched at her address. They hadn\u2019t formally discussed any dominant/submissive agreement but it was obvious that she enjoyed playing with the idea. \u201cI\u2019ll have to punish you for that, my love.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps covered her skin. She didn\u2019t know if it was from Severus\u2019 nickname for her or because he had pulled the blankets off, exposing her skin to the cool air. She moaned in agreement and he pulled his finger out, bringing it up to her lips and allowing her to suck her juices off. \u201cI want you face down, ass up,\u201d he said.</p><p>She followed his instruction and felt his hands pull her underwear off. She then felt the material being used to mop up her arousal and then slowly be pushed into her pussy. Her heart raced at the thought, \u2018Gods, how humiliating.\u2019Her stomach was doing backflips in apprehension of what was about to come.</p><p>His hand started to caress her backside, appreciating the natural curves. A finger slid down between the cheeks, lingering and circling around her puckered asshole. Severus raised his hand and brought it down onto her right cheek.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d she exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>He did the same again, this time on the left and this time she moaned out. He was cautious as he continued, wanting to turn her plump ass red but also not wanting it to hurt too much but he couldn\u2019t help it. Each one of his harder slaps caused her to moan out. He persisted with the slaps until her cheeks were a nice pink colour.</p><p>He shifted around and kissed the now tender skin. He lay kisses all around before kissing the tight star. He allowed his lips to remain there longer than the other kisses. His tongue darted out and Lyra was surprised at the intrusion.</p><p>Her eyes were shut tightly, focusing on the feeling of his tongue flicking at the hole. As she relaxed into it she found that she enjoyed it, it wasn\u2019t a feeling that she could get off to but the thought that her lover was taking pleasure in appreciating every inch of her was nice. He definitely seemed to be enjoying it, showing great enthusiasm during the act.</p><p>It was now Severus\u2019 time for pleasure, he pulled her panties out and pressed them against her mouth. Hesitantly she took the soaked garment into her mouth and felt Severus\u2019 cock pressing at her entrance. It was obvious she was too dry to take him in so to warm her back he sucked on his thumb briefly before pressing it against the puckered hole he had been appreciating only a few minutes before.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s asshole gave way easily to the thick digit and she let out a muffled moan. He wiggled his thumb around, even pulling it out slightly before pressing it back in. Lyra\u2019s hips thrust back into the movements, wanting more friction. Severus pressed the tip of his cock at her entrance once more, feeling that it was slick with her arousal again he pressed in.</p><p>She gasped at the feeling of his length slowly sliding in and filling her. One hand gripped her hips as he pumped in and out, occasionally pressing his thumb down to stimulate his erection. He groaned at the stimulation, her walls contracting around him as he fucked her.</p><p>Lyra reached down, pressing her face into the mattress to try and get leverage on her clit. She rubbed it fast as Severus pounded her from behind. She screamed as she came, her underwear still stuffed in her mouth absorbing the sound.</p><p>He continued the steady rhythm. In and out of her pulsing pussy. He reached down and removed her panties, discarding them so she could breathe. Her lips were pressed together tightly, she was humming a song of pleasure as he hammered her.</p><p>She flicked her bean once more, desperate to come again. Her pussy was so wet she could hear him sliding in and out of her. She groaned in a mixture of embarrassment and pleasure, her cunt twitching again as she neared release.</p><p>\u201cWait for me,\u201d he said, speeding up his pace.</p><p>His movements were purposeful and hard. Each thrust reaching deep inside her. He could feel her quaking around him, trying to stave off her orgasm. Her fingers left her clitoris, instead desperately gripping the bed sheets in an attempt to keep herself upright and bracing herself from his onslaught. She tried to resist, yet despite the decreased stimulation she came hard once more with an exasperated moan.</p><p>She shuddered, her body twitching under him, wanting to give way. The walls around Severus\u2019 cock were milking him and with a few more thrusts he came deep inside her. He rolled to the side as Lyra\u2019s body collapsed onto the bed.</p><p>He pulled her close once more, their bodies covered in a sheen of sweat. Lyra was panting but soon her breathing steadied and the two surrendered to sleep.</p><p>The morning after was filled with peppered kisses. Lyra had awoken before Severus and unleashed her love on the man\u2019s exposed body. He awoke with a smile, happy to see his love laying in bed with him.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Sevvy,\u201d she said, pecking him on the lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re usually never this affectionate when you wake up,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to wake up with you lying next to me every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes lit up, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can use the floo to go between our rooms,\u201d he said.</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded, \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>He hummed in agreeance, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>The pair remained in bed together until they decided it was time to get up. After searching through the bare and dirty cupboard in the Snape House she decided to quickly apparate to Diagon Alley for a few supplies. She was back after a few minutes, a few eggs and bacon in tow. Lyra pulled out her wand and began to make breakfast.</p><p>\u201cDid Narcissa teach you how to cook too?\u201d he asked, watching on from the table.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cI also learnt a few tricks from Uncle Ted and Aunt Andy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Tonks\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I stopped by for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows were raised, \u201cDo Lucius and Narcissa know?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cThey\u2019d throw me to the curb if they knew. I only saw them just the once but they were nice. The sisters are still very bitter about everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>Severus felt enlightened by the new addition of information. Maybe there was still hope to sway Lyra onto the Order\u2019s side if she still looked to her mother\u2019s estranged sister as family.</p><p>She came and sat down next to him, serving the simple breakfast of bacon and eggs. For some reason it tasted better than anything he had ever eaten before. Maybe it was the company that was present, maybe it was because she made it, maybe she had spiked it with love potion. These were just theories going through Severus\u2019 head as he watched her as she flicked through the copy of the Daily Prophet she had picked up that morning.</p><p>\u201cGustav is going to be meeting me in Hogsmeade for an interview,\u201d she said, \u201cIn about an hour or so. Then I\u2019ve got to write my paper and send it off to be published.\u201d</p><p>Severus nodded, his heart sinking a little. He had hoped that he would have the opportunity to spend the whole weekend with her but he did enjoy the day they had together. Once they finished eating they apparated into Hogsmeade and killed some time browsing the shops. As it inched closer to the meeting time, the two made their way to the Three Broomsticks.</p><p>Gustav was early, he was wrapped up in a brown winter coat, complimented by a red scarf. He beamed at Lyra, waving at her as he made his way over.</p><p>\u201cLyra!\u201d he said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cGustav!\u201d she pulled him into a hug. When separating she introduced her to Severus. \u201cThis is my friend, Severus. He teaches Potions at Hogwarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d Gustav repeated, offering him a hand. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Severus gave a curt nod to the man whilst taking his hand. \u201cI will take this opportunity to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Lyra asked with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have to prepare for my classes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lyra frowned, \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d stay, I mean you helped me with the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your brilliant mind that did all the work,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d she sighed, pulling him into a hug. \u201cYou better come around tonight or I\u2019ll be knocking down your door.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and left.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Gustav asked.</p><p>Lyra smiled, exhaling a small laugh. She shook her head, \u201cWe\u2019re just colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd Syrin is just my housemate.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cCan I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust firewhisky thanks,\u201d he replied as he took a seat.</p><p>Lyra returned with two drinks in hand and he prompted her to go on a detailed spiel about the research she had carried out from start to finish. Once he had enough information for the article the two relaxed and began to chat.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the wedding planning going?\u201d Lyra asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve had to push it forward a bit,\u201d Gustav replied, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be April 20th.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow, that\u2019s like two months away,\u201d Lyra commented, \u201cThat\u2019s not much time to get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, um, Syrin is pregnant,\u201d Gustav said.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d she said excitedly pulling Gustav into a hug.</p><p>He gave a sheepish laugh, \u201cYeah, a bit of a surprise really but you can\u2019t help these things. We weren\u2019t planning on having kids for a while. It sort of screws up plans for Syrin career wise.\u201d Lyra frowned. \u201cBut this article with you should be big,\u201d he continued, \u201cI really appreciate you asking me to cover it. I think it\u2019ll pay well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problems,\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the idiot they sent from the Prophet. She started interviewing the wrong person then was shocked when she found out I was the one who discovered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only the worst journalist in Britain,\u201d he laughed, \u201cYet somehow she\u2019s the most famous. I don\u2019t know how anyone reads anything she writes, it rarely has any substance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt she\u2019ll try and spin some bullshit story out of our interaction,\u201d Lyra groaned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress too much,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll make you sound like an angel.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI know it\u2019s a difficult task but no one is as good as you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her compliment, \u201cThanks Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you pump out the article before she does,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I will,\u201d Gustav said, slinging back the rest of his firewhiskey.</p>",

The cobblestone streets were lined with brick terraced houses that looked as though they had been copied and pasted a million times over to fill the streets. The street lights where the witch and wizard stood were out, prompting the man to pull out his wand and the tip lit up. He walked towards the house that stood in front of them and the woman followed closely behind.</p><p>Severus opened the door and the two entered, the floor creaking as it took their weight. He flicked his wand upwards, illuminating the room with a small oil lamp. They had entered directly into the living room which was decorated rather poorly and much like the street, it looked rather worn. Lyra\u2019s eyes were drawn to the walls first, there were stacks of books lining them all bound in leather. She wondered whether they were muggle or magical but she couldn\u2019t read them in the poor light. There was a small fireplace and in front of it sat an armchair, a sofa and a small coffee table.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no Malfoy Manor,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou said that about your quarters as well,\u201d Lyra commented.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should\u2019ve taken you there instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she dismissed, taking his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Sev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t come here often. Usually I stay at the school even over the break.\u201d</p><p>\u2018I can see why ,\u2019 she thought to herself. She sucked her lip in, trying to stop the words from spilling from her mouth. \u201cI appreciate you welcoming me into your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget that you\u2019re used to a life of luxury,\u201d he said, lazily he flicked his wand at the fireplace and pulled her towards the sofa. \u201cTake a seat, I have more wine.\u201d</p><p>She let the comment slide by and simply followed his instruction; waiting for the wizard to return with two large goblets in hand. He passed one to Lyra and sat next to her. She smiled in thanks before their eyes both focused on the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like growing up here?\u201d she asked, breaking the silence between them. She noticed his jaw tense at the topic and immediately scolded herself for asking. It was obvious that he had a difficult home life and she just had to reopen those wounds. She pulled his hand into hers and apologised. \u201cSorry, you don\u2019t have to answer.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, \u201cIt was hard, Lyra. We struggled.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and looked at him while his eyes reflected the flames of the fire. She longed to know what was going on in that head of his but she didn\u2019t know Legilimency so instead she put her glass down and that hand met the other to hold his in an affectionate manner. The gesture managed to pull him from his memories and look over to her.</p><p>Her eyes were full of warmth and understanding. Her touch was full of care. Severus could tell that Lyra genuinely cared for him and he felt comfortable enough to continue. \u201cMy parents would fight all the time. It was mainly yelling but it escalated, soon he threw things out of anger and then it was him hitting her. I tried to intervene at times but I was only a boy. My mother knew magic but she didn\u2019t protect herself, she didn\u2019t protect me. I tried my best to protect her when I could but I wasn\u2019t there when it was at its worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother could\u2019ve had everything, she could\u2019ve had a better life but she tossed it all away from him and I don\u2019t understand why. She was a pureblood and she left her family and fortune behind for my father just to live like a muggle and to die at his hands.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met Lyra\u2019s again and he felt his heart sink, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be like her and I don\u2019t want to be like him. I don\u2019t want you to throw away all you have for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she said, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my mother loved him too but things change, Lyra,\u201d his voice began to escalate. He tried to pull away but Lyra\u2019s hands kept a firm grip on his.</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not your father. You\u2019re nothing like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know him, you don\u2019t know how I\u2019m like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said in a soft tone. She looked at him, her head tilted to the side with a warm, encouraging smile. She began to speak again when his eyes drifted back to her. \u201cSev, you can always change. People look at me and see my mother and father, and while I do look an awful lot like them and I can be just as cruel, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to be. We can change our future.\u201d</p><p>He looked away again. He couldn\u2019t stand staring into those brown eyes. They were so full of love and affection, he could dive in and get lost in the love that she had for him but he was scared. His doubt would weigh him down and he\u2019d find himself drowning if he didn\u2019t try to keep himself out. It was just too much.</p><p>Severus wanted to believe those words. She made everything sound so sweet and simple. He knew she wasn\u2019t naive but it was so hard to think that maybe she was right. He had been stuck in the same pattern of thinking for years, distancing himself from others, telling himself that he was inadequate and unworthy of love but Lyra made a small part of himself believe that maybe he could be worthy of her affection.</p><p>\u201cI killed him,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t know what made him admit it. He felt the truth weigh on him a million times before but he had never voiced it before. Maybe he hoped it would drive her away but it didn\u2019t. Her eyes remained warm and kind even at the face of the evil he had committed. \u201cThe Dark Lord wanted me to prove my loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you feel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was easy,\u201d he replied. All the tension in his face was gone but his look had a hint of disgust, almost as though he hated himself for thinking that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never killed anyone before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try to keep it that way,\u201d he said, \u201cOnce you tear your soul like that there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I never have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day you might have to. What will you do if the Dark Lord returns?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard before reaching for her wine. After a sip she spoke, \u201cWhen I was younger I was convinced that he would return and I\u2019d be reunited with my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recall.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the memory of her youth but her face dropped as she continued. \u201cBack then I was convinced I\u2019d join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her face against the goblet, almost to hide her face. She exhaled deeply before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t want to believe he\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. I haven\u2019t allowed my mind to dwell on it for too long, I\u2019d just tell myself that he won\u2019t, that it\u2019s been ten years and there\u2019s no sign of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbus told me there have been whispers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere always have been, you were there when the inner circle wanted to bring him back. Even my mother told me seek him out when I became of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She scratched the back of her neck in frustration, \u201cBecause I decided to stop pursuing the Dark Arts and I just didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scared, you still are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, \u201cWhere will your loyalties lie when he returns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to be scared of,\u201d his tone was venomous and threatening, cautioning Lyra to back off of the subject.</p><p>She smiled at the ferocity of his words. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Despite her outward appearance, relishing in the moment her heart ached. She wanted to shatter and cry at the knife in her chest so she looked away. Severus didn\u2019t answer her statement, instead he continued to stare at the flames as he took a deep sip of his wine. Lyra too drank, allowing the tension to hang between them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to trust me,\u201d she said sadly after a few moments, \u201cIt\u2019d be naive to and I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a bit disappointed but I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said, \u201cHe\u2019ll use these memories as a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to learn Occlumency again,\u201d he said, \u201cWe never finished our lessons.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and threw back the rest of her wine. She sunk back into the chair and allowed the warmth of the fireplace and the alcohol pumping through her veins lull her to sleep.</p><p>Severus sighed to himself upon the observation that the witch had fallen asleep. He reached out and touched her, hoping that it would wake her but instead her wrapped around his own and held on tightly. Her unconscious gesture tugged at his heart and internally he admonished himself.</p><p>Falling in love with Lyra was a mistake. Placing himself in the position to was a mistake. It was so blatantly obvious to him in that moment that their whole relationship was destined to fail from the start but for some unknown reason he had allowed himself to be whisked away on this turbulent romance and now she was here, where no other woman had been in his childhood home, sleeping on his couch.</p><p>He convinced himself it was just the sex. That he didn\u2019t really love her but her body. Her lips, her touch, her sweet pussy wrapped around him. The flush that would appear across her cheeks whenever he said something vulgar. Even when he was reminding himself of those times of passion he could feel his cock stir but his head must\u2019ve got the messages mixed up because he felt his heart beating out of his chest as well.</p><p>He loved her. There was no denying it.</p><p>At the mere mention of her name he could picture her face smiling up at him and his heart would tug slightly. He\u2019d even hear her sing out his name. Sev. Severus. Gods, how sweet and safe did it sound in her mouth.</p><p>He could fall deeper and deeper in love with her, just at the thought of her.</p><p>It was problematic, to say the least. Even Albus himself had asked about the nature of their relationship after seeing that they had spent a great deal of time together. He had discouraged it completely, particularly after sharing information about the Dark Lord\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cSeverus, it had come to my knowledge that a piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul has been residing in Albania,\u201d Albus said as he sat at his desk. \u201cSoon, the time will come where I will have to ask you to spy for the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Severus replied.</p><p>\u201cI am, however, apprehensive about the nature of your relationship with Professor Lestrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Lyra seem to be rather\u2026 close.\u201d</p><p>Severus remained silent, allowing Albus to continue.</p><p>\u201cIt worries me, Severus,\u201d he said shaking his head, searching deep in his eyes. Severus\u2019 mind was shielded well from the effects of Albus\u2019 Legilimency. \u201cAs good hearted as Lyra is, I fear that when the time comes to it she will side with her family and I don\u2019t want you divulging all our secrets to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Severus replied.</p><p>\u201cAh, but Severus you are in love with her and love is a fickle thing.\u201d</p><p>Severus didn\u2019t believe that their love was fickle, he felt as though it was constant it was just the feelings and circumstances around it that changed. He felt as though if there weren\u2019t so many external pressures maybe they\u2019d have a chance together. He knew it was wishful thinking because the issue was no longer the fact that she was the niece of his close friend or that she was the pureblood daughter of two the sacred 28. It was the fact that the Dark Lord would return and her entire family were loyal to him and if they were loyal she would be too.</p><p>Where would she hold her loyalty to him?</p><p>Would their bond of love override what she had with her family?</p><p>No. Probably not. Severus knew this and it was a difficult pill to swallow. He couldn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>There was a part of his mind that hoped that Lyra was right, that the rumours of Voldemort\u2019s existence were just rumours with no substance but Albus had been adamant that they were true. He just wanted his relationship with Lyra to work out. No one could compare to her. She was beautiful and sweet, kind-hearted and intelligent.</p><p>He thought for a moment whether or not if he had fallen for another woman that was separate from the Death Eaters whether or not it would work out. No, she too would be used against him in the same way Lyra would be. At least Lyra had a fighting chance, he could train her to protect their memories of them together because now not only was she his weakness but he knew that he would be hers as well. Occlumency lessons seemed to be the way to go. It would allow him to see what she truly felt about her as well as give her a chance to stand up to the Dark Lord if it came down to it.</p><p>Slowly, he finished his glass as his mind continued to whir about the future. He set down the now empty glass and placed a free hand on her back to gently rouse her from her sleep. He guided the witch in her half-asleep state up the stairs and into his bedroom. His worries faded as quickly as she had shed her clothes, lust overcame the thoughts in his head. She slipped under the covers, dressed only in her underwear and once hidden she undid her bra and dropped it onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to maintain your modesty now?\u201d he asked as he slid into bed with her.</p><p>\u201cYou might see my breasts and want to shag me,\u201d she said as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but cup her breasts that she had just freed. His erection was obvious, already poking her backside. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She moaned as his fingers pinched her nipples and his mouth found its way over the marks he had left the night prior. \u201cLyra,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI just want you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Sev,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he hummed against her skin.</p><p>She moaned in agreement, her hips grinding back against his member.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve warned you about grinding on my cock before,\u201d he breathed, tugging on her nipples a bit more roughly.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tie me up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might just have to spank you instead,\u201d he said, \u201cDon\u2019t think you learned your lesson the first time.\u201d He could hear her swallow at the thought. \u201cI could get you so worked up with my words, couldn\u2019t I? I could tell you how I\u2019d bend you over my lap and spank you until your bum is red and you could probably come at the mere thought. Who knew I had such a dirty girl on my hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she breathed, getting worked up from the simultaneous stimulation of her mind and her nipples. There was a coil of heat building in her stomach that she just knew was causing arousal to pool between her legs.</p><p>\u201cYes, my love,\u201d he said.</p><p>That endearing nickname gave her butterflies everytime he said it. It made it so much harder for her to get her words out. \u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be patient,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to be begging for me to fuck you before I let my cock anywhere near your cunt.\u201d</p><p>He knew every button push to have her writhing in his arms. His hand dipped down and slid underneath her panties, rubbing around her clitoris. Desperate high pitched moans escaped her as he just kept circling the swollen nub whilst pulling at her sensitive nipples.</p><p>A fire was raging in her core, hot flames licked at her clit as it became overbearingly sensitive. She strained against his touch almost as though she was trying to get away from it but god, did she love the pleasure it brought.</p><p>Severus didn\u2019t even need to check whether or not she was wet. He could feel it flooding her panties to the point where his fingers were coated in her juices despite not navigating anywhere near her aching hole. Squeals began to build in her throat as the stimulation of her clitoris continued.</p><p>He left it alone and pushed a single digit into her soaked entrance and wiggled it around before leaving it there unmoving. Her hips began to buck up into his hand and he could feel her pussy twitch and squeeze around it, desperate for her release. A few more thrusts from the girl against his steady hand and she came hard around the finger, the walls pulsing tightly around it.</p><p>\u201cDid I say you could come?\u201d he asked in a threatening tone. Her pussy clenched again at the sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d she said, her voice weak and wavering from her orgasm.</p><p>His cock twitched at her address. They hadn\u2019t formally discussed any dominant/submissive agreement but it was obvious that she enjoyed playing with the idea. \u201cI\u2019ll have to punish you for that, my love.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps covered her skin. She didn\u2019t know if it was from Severus\u2019 nickname for her or because he had pulled the blankets off, exposing her skin to the cool air. She moaned in agreement and he pulled his finger out, bringing it up to her lips and allowing her to suck her juices off. \u201cI want you face down, ass up,\u201d he said.</p><p>She followed his instruction and felt his hands pull her underwear off. She then felt the material being used to mop up her arousal and then slowly be pushed into her pussy. Her heart raced at the thought, \u2018Gods, how humiliating.\u2019Her stomach was doing backflips in apprehension of what was about to come.</p><p>His hand started to caress her backside, appreciating the natural curves. A finger slid down between the cheeks, lingering and circling around her puckered asshole. Severus raised his hand and brought it down onto her right cheek.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d she exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>He did the same again, this time on the left and this time she moaned out. He was cautious as he continued, wanting to turn her plump ass red but also not wanting it to hurt too much but he couldn\u2019t help it. Each one of his harder slaps caused her to moan out. He persisted with the slaps until her cheeks were a nice pink colour.</p><p>He shifted around and kissed the now tender skin. He lay kisses all around before kissing the tight star. He allowed his lips to remain there longer than the other kisses. His tongue darted out and Lyra was surprised at the intrusion.</p><p>Her eyes were shut tightly, focusing on the feeling of his tongue flicking at the hole. As she relaxed into it she found that she enjoyed it, it wasn\u2019t a feeling that she could get off to but the thought that her lover was taking pleasure in appreciating every inch of her was nice. He definitely seemed to be enjoying it, showing great enthusiasm during the act.</p><p>It was now Severus\u2019 time for pleasure, he pulled her panties out and pressed them against her mouth. Hesitantly she took the soaked garment into her mouth and felt Severus\u2019 cock pressing at her entrance. It was obvious she was too dry to take him in so to warm her back he sucked on his thumb briefly before pressing it against the puckered hole he had been appreciating only a few minutes before.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s asshole gave way easily to the thick digit and she let out a muffled moan. He wiggled his thumb around, even pulling it out slightly before pressing it back in. Lyra\u2019s hips thrust back into the movements, wanting more friction. Severus pressed the tip of his cock at her entrance once more, feeling that it was slick with her arousal again he pressed in.</p><p>She gasped at the feeling of his length slowly sliding in and filling her. One hand gripped her hips as he pumped in and out, occasionally pressing his thumb down to stimulate his erection. He groaned at the stimulation, her walls contracting around him as he fucked her.</p><p>Lyra reached down, pressing her face into the mattress to try and get leverage on her clit. She rubbed it fast as Severus pounded her from behind. She screamed as she came, her underwear still stuffed in her mouth absorbing the sound.</p><p>He continued the steady rhythm. In and out of her pulsing pussy. He reached down and removed her panties, discarding them so she could breathe. Her lips were pressed together tightly, she was humming a song of pleasure as he hammered her.</p><p>She flicked her bean once more, desperate to come again. Her pussy was so wet she could hear him sliding in and out of her. She groaned in a mixture of embarrassment and pleasure, her cunt twitching again as she neared release.</p><p>\u201cWait for me,\u201d he said, speeding up his pace.</p><p>His movements were purposeful and hard. Each thrust reaching deep inside her. He could feel her quaking around him, trying to stave off her orgasm. Her fingers left her clitoris, instead desperately gripping the bed sheets in an attempt to keep herself upright and bracing herself from his onslaught. She tried to resist, yet despite the decreased stimulation she came hard once more with an exasperated moan.</p><p>She shuddered, her body twitching under him, wanting to give way. The walls around Severus\u2019 cock were milking him and with a few more thrusts he came deep inside her. He rolled to the side as Lyra\u2019s body collapsed onto the bed.</p><p>He pulled her close once more, their bodies covered in a sheen of sweat. Lyra was panting but soon her breathing steadied and the two surrendered to sleep.</p><p>The morning after was filled with peppered kisses. Lyra had awoken before Severus and unleashed her love on the man\u2019s exposed body. He awoke with a smile, happy to see his love laying in bed with him.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Sevvy,\u201d she said, pecking him on the lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re usually never this affectionate when you wake up,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to wake up with you lying next to me every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes lit up, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can use the floo to go between our rooms,\u201d he said.</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded, \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>He hummed in agreeance, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>The pair remained in bed together until they decided it was time to get up. After searching through the bare and dirty cupboard in the Snape House she decided to quickly apparate to Diagon Alley for a few supplies. She was back after a few minutes, a few eggs and bacon in tow. Lyra pulled out her wand and began to make breakfast.</p><p>\u201cDid Narcissa teach you how to cook too?\u201d he asked, watching on from the table.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, \u201cI also learnt a few tricks from Uncle Ted and Aunt Andy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Tonks\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I stopped by for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows were raised, \u201cDo Lucius and Narcissa know?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cThey\u2019d throw me to the curb if they knew. I only saw them just the once but they were nice. The sisters are still very bitter about everything that happened.\u201d</p><p>Severus felt enlightened by the new addition of information. Maybe there was still hope to sway Lyra onto the Order\u2019s side if she still looked to her mother\u2019s estranged sister as family.</p><p>She came and sat down next to him, serving the simple breakfast of bacon and eggs. For some reason it tasted better than anything he had ever eaten before. Maybe it was the company that was present, maybe it was because she made it, maybe she had spiked it with love potion. These were just theories going through Severus\u2019 head as he watched her as she flicked through the copy of the Daily Prophet she had picked up that morning.</p><p>\u201cGustav is going to be meeting me in Hogsmeade for an interview,\u201d she said, \u201cIn about an hour or so. Then I\u2019ve got to write my paper and send it off to be published.\u201d</p><p>Severus nodded, his heart sinking a little. He had hoped that he would have the opportunity to spend the whole weekend with her but he did enjoy the day they had together. Once they finished eating they apparated into Hogsmeade and killed some time browsing the shops. As it inched closer to the meeting time, the two made their way to the Three Broomsticks.</p><p>Gustav was early, he was wrapped up in a brown winter coat, complimented by a red scarf. He beamed at Lyra, waving at her as he made his way over.</p><p>\u201cLyra!\u201d he said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cGustav!\u201d she pulled him into a hug. When separating she introduced her to Severus. \u201cThis is my friend, Severus. He teaches Potions at Hogwarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d Gustav repeated, offering him a hand. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Severus gave a curt nod to the man whilst taking his hand. \u201cI will take this opportunity to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Lyra asked with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have to prepare for my classes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lyra frowned, \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d stay, I mean you helped me with the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your brilliant mind that did all the work,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d she sighed, pulling him into a hug. \u201cYou better come around tonight or I\u2019ll be knocking down your door.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and left.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Gustav asked.</p><p>Lyra smiled, exhaling a small laugh. She shook her head, \u201cWe\u2019re just colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd Syrin is just my housemate.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cCan I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust firewhisky thanks,\u201d he replied as he took a seat.</p><p>Lyra returned with two drinks in hand and he prompted her to go on a detailed spiel about the research she had carried out from start to finish. Once he had enough information for the article the two relaxed and began to chat.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the wedding planning going?\u201d Lyra asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve had to push it forward a bit,\u201d Gustav replied, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be April 20th.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow, that\u2019s like two months away,\u201d Lyra commented, \u201cThat\u2019s not much time to get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, um, Syrin is pregnant,\u201d Gustav said.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d she said excitedly pulling Gustav into a hug.</p><p>He gave a sheepish laugh, \u201cYeah, a bit of a surprise really but you can\u2019t help these things. We weren\u2019t planning on having kids for a while. It sort of screws up plans for Syrin career wise.\u201d Lyra frowned. \u201cBut this article with you should be big,\u201d he continued, \u201cI really appreciate you asking me to cover it. I think it\u2019ll pay well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problems,\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the idiot they sent from the Prophet. She started interviewing the wrong person then was shocked when she found out I was the one who discovered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only the worst journalist in Britain,\u201d he laughed, \u201cYet somehow she\u2019s the most famous. I don\u2019t know how anyone reads anything she writes, it rarely has any substance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt she\u2019ll try and spin some bullshit story out of our interaction,\u201d Lyra groaned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress too much,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll make you sound like an angel.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI know it\u2019s a difficult task but no one is as good as you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her compliment, \u201cThanks Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you pump out the article before she does,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I will,\u201d Gustav said, slinging back the rest of his firewhiskey.</p>",

The cobblestone streets were lined with brick terraced houses that looked as though they had been copied and pasted a million times over to fill the streets. The street lights where the witch and wizard stood were out, prompting the man to pull out his wand and the tip lit up. He walked towards the house that stood in front of them and the woman followed closely behind.</p><p>Severus opened the door and the two entered, the floor creaking as it took their weight. He flicked his wand upwards, illuminating the room with a small oil lamp. They had entered directly into the living room which was decorated rather poorly and much like the street, it looked rather worn. Lyra&rsquo;s eyes were drawn to the walls first, there were stacks of books lining them all bound in leather. She wondered whether they were muggle or magical but she couldn&rsquo;t read them in the poor light. There was a small fireplace and in front of it sat an armchair, a sofa and a small coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no Malfoy Manor,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;You said that about your quarters as well,&rdquo; Lyra commented.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should&rsquo;ve taken you there instead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she dismissed, taking his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Sev.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come here often. Usually I stay at the school even over the break.&rdquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I can see why ,&rsquo; she thought to herself. She sucked her lip in, trying to stop the words from spilling from her mouth. &ldquo;I appreciate you welcoming me into your home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I forget that you&rsquo;re used to a life of luxury,&rdquo; he said, lazily he flicked his wand at the fireplace and pulled her towards the sofa. &ldquo;Take a seat, I have more wine.&rdquo;</p><p>She let the comment slide by and simply followed his instruction; waiting for the wizard to return with two large goblets in hand. He passed one to Lyra and sat next to her. She smiled in thanks before their eyes both focused on the fire.</p><p>&ldquo;What was it like growing up here?&rdquo; she asked, breaking the silence between them. She noticed his jaw tense at the topic and immediately scolded herself for asking. It was obvious that he had a difficult home life and she just had to reopen those wounds. She pulled his hand into hers and apologised. &ldquo;Sorry, you don&rsquo;t have to answer.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed, &ldquo;It was hard, Lyra. We struggled.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and looked at him while his eyes reflected the flames of the fire. She longed to know what was going on in that head of his but she didn&rsquo;t know Legilimency so instead she put her glass down and that hand met the other to hold his in an affectionate manner. The gesture managed to pull him from his memories and look over to her.</p><p>Her eyes were full of warmth and understanding. Her touch was full of care. Severus could tell that Lyra genuinely cared for him and he felt comfortable enough to continue. &ldquo;My parents would fight all the time. It was mainly yelling but it escalated, soon he threw things out of anger and then it was him hitting her. I tried to intervene at times but I was only a boy. My mother knew magic but she didn&rsquo;t protect herself, she didn&rsquo;t protect me. I tried my best to protect her when I could but I wasn&rsquo;t there when it was at its worst.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mother could&rsquo;ve had everything, she could&rsquo;ve had a better life but she tossed it all away from him and I don&rsquo;t understand why. She was a pureblood and she left her family and fortune behind for my father just to live like a muggle and to die at his hands.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes met Lyra&rsquo;s again and he felt his heart sink, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be like her and I don&rsquo;t want to be like him. I don&rsquo;t want you to throw away all you have for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my mother loved him too but things change, Lyra,&rdquo; his voice began to escalate. He tried to pull away but Lyra&rsquo;s hands kept a firm grip on his.</p><p>&ldquo;Severus,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not your father. You&rsquo;re nothing like him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know him, you don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she said in a soft tone. She looked at him, her head tilted to the side with a warm, encouraging smile. She began to speak again when his eyes drifted back to her. &ldquo;Sev, you can always change. People look at me and see my mother and father, and while I do look an awful lot like them and I can be just as cruel, it doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to be. We can change our future.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked away again. He couldn&rsquo;t stand staring into those brown eyes. They were so full of love and affection, he could dive in and get lost in the love that she had for him but he was scared. His doubt would weigh him down and he&rsquo;d find himself drowning if he didn&rsquo;t try to keep himself out. It was just too much.</p><p>Severus wanted to believe those words. She made everything sound so sweet and simple. He knew she wasn&rsquo;t naive but it was so hard to think that maybe she was right. He had been stuck in the same pattern of thinking for years, distancing himself from others, telling himself that he was inadequate and unworthy of love but Lyra made a small part of himself believe that maybe he could be worthy of her affection.</p><p>&ldquo;I killed him,&rdquo; he said. He didn&rsquo;t know what made him admit it. He felt the truth weigh on him a million times before but he had never voiced it before. Maybe he hoped it would drive her away but it didn&rsquo;t. Her eyes remained warm and kind even at the face of the evil he had committed. &ldquo;The Dark Lord wanted me to prove my loyalty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you feel?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It was easy,&rdquo; he replied. All the tension in his face was gone but his look had a hint of disgust, almost as though he hated himself for thinking that way.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never killed anyone before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should try to keep it that way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Once you tear your soul like that there&rsquo;s no going back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope I never have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One day you might have to. What will you do if the Dark Lord returns?&rdquo;</p><p>She swallowed hard before reaching for her wine. After a sip she spoke, &ldquo;When I was younger I was convinced that he would return and I&rsquo;d be reunited with my parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I recall.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled at the memory of her youth but her face dropped as she continued. &ldquo;Back then I was convinced I&rsquo;d join.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But now?&rdquo;</p><p>She pressed her face against the goblet, almost to hide her face. She exhaled deeply before answering. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to believe he&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve to think he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do. I haven&rsquo;t allowed my mind to dwell on it for too long, I&rsquo;d just tell myself that he won&rsquo;t, that it&rsquo;s been ten years and there&rsquo;s no sign of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Albus told me there have been whispers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There always have been, you were there when the inner circle wanted to bring him back. Even my mother told me seek him out when I became of age.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>She scratched the back of her neck in frustration, &ldquo;Because I decided to stop pursuing the Dark Arts and I just didn&rsquo;t want to believe it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were scared, you still are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;Where will your loyalties lie when he returns?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing to be scared of,&rdquo; his tone was venomous and threatening, cautioning Lyra to back off of the subject.</p><p>She smiled at the ferocity of his words. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite her outward appearance, relishing in the moment her heart ached. She wanted to shatter and cry at the knife in her chest so she looked away. Severus didn&rsquo;t answer her statement, instead he continued to stare at the flames as he took a deep sip of his wine. Lyra too drank, allowing the tension to hang between them.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to trust me,&rdquo; she said sadly after a few moments, &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be naive to and I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed but I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll use these memories as a weapon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to learn Occlumency again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;We never finished our lessons.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and threw back the rest of her wine. She sunk back into the chair and allowed the warmth of the fireplace and the alcohol pumping through her veins lull her to sleep.</p><p>Severus sighed to himself upon the observation that the witch had fallen asleep. He reached out and touched her, hoping that it would wake her but instead her wrapped around his own and held on tightly. Her unconscious gesture tugged at his heart and internally he admonished himself.</p><p>Falling in love with Lyra was a mistake. Placing himself in the position to was a mistake. It was so blatantly obvious to him in that moment that their whole relationship was destined to fail from the start but for some unknown reason he had allowed himself to be whisked away on this turbulent romance and now she was here, where no other woman had been in his childhood home, sleeping on his couch.</p><p>He convinced himself it was just the sex. That he didn&rsquo;t really love her but her body. Her lips, her touch, her sweet pussy wrapped around him. The flush that would appear across her cheeks whenever he said something vulgar. Even when he was reminding himself of those times of passion he could feel his cock stir but his head must&rsquo;ve got the messages mixed up because he felt his heart beating out of his chest as well.</p><p>He loved her. There was no denying it.</p><p>At the mere mention of her name he could picture her face smiling up at him and his heart would tug slightly. He&rsquo;d even hear her sing out his name. Sev. Severus. Gods, how sweet and safe did it sound in her mouth.</p><p>He could fall deeper and deeper in love with her, just at the thought of her.</p><p>It was problematic, to say the least. Even Albus himself had asked about the nature of their relationship after seeing that they had spent a great deal of time together. He had discouraged it completely, particularly after sharing information about the Dark Lord&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p><p>&ldquo;Severus, it had come to my knowledge that a piece of Voldemort&rsquo;s soul has been residing in Albania,&rdquo; Albus said as he sat at his desk. &ldquo;Soon, the time will come where I will have to ask you to spy for the order.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Severus replied.</p><p>&ldquo;I am, however, apprehensive about the nature of your relationship with Professor Lestrange.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and Lyra seem to be rather&hellip; close.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus remained silent, allowing Albus to continue.</p><p>&ldquo;It worries me, Severus,&rdquo; he said shaking his head, searching deep in his eyes. Severus&rsquo; mind was shielded well from the effects of Albus&rsquo; Legilimency. &ldquo;As good hearted as Lyra is, I fear that when the time comes to it she will side with her family and I don&rsquo;t want you divulging all our secrets to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Severus replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, but Severus you are in love with her and love is a fickle thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus didn&rsquo;t believe that their love was fickle, he felt as though it was constant it was just the feelings and circumstances around it that changed. He felt as though if there weren&rsquo;t so many external pressures maybe they&rsquo;d have a chance together. He knew it was wishful thinking because the issue was no longer the fact that she was the niece of his close friend or that she was the pureblood daughter of two the sacred 28. It was the fact that the Dark Lord would return and her entire family were loyal to him and if they were loyal she would be too.</p><p>Where would she hold her loyalty to him?</p><p>Would their bond of love override what she had with her family?</p><p>No. Probably not. Severus knew this and it was a difficult pill to swallow. He couldn&rsquo;t trust her.</p><p>There was a part of his mind that hoped that Lyra was right, that the rumours of Voldemort&rsquo;s existence were just rumours with no substance but Albus had been adamant that they were true. He just wanted his relationship with Lyra to work out. No one could compare to her. She was beautiful and sweet, kind-hearted and intelligent.</p><p>He thought for a moment whether or not if he had fallen for another woman that was separate from the Death Eaters whether or not it would work out. No, she too would be used against him in the same way Lyra would be. At least Lyra had a fighting chance, he could train her to protect their memories of them together because now not only was she his weakness but he knew that he would be hers as well. Occlumency lessons seemed to be the way to go. It would allow him to see what she truly felt about her as well as give her a chance to stand up to the Dark Lord if it came down to it.</p><p>Slowly, he finished his glass as his mind continued to whir about the future. He set down the now empty glass and placed a free hand on her back to gently rouse her from her sleep. He guided the witch in her half-asleep state up the stairs and into his bedroom. His worries faded as quickly as she had shed her clothes, lust overcame the thoughts in his head. She slipped under the covers, dressed only in her underwear and once hidden she undid her bra and dropped it onto the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you trying to maintain your modesty now?&rdquo; he asked as he slid into bed with her.</p><p>&ldquo;You might see my breasts and want to shag me,&rdquo; she said as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t help but cup her breasts that she had just freed. His erection was obvious, already poking her backside. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s too late for that,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>She moaned as his fingers pinched her nipples and his mouth found its way over the marks he had left the night prior. &ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I just want you to be mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours, Sev,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; he hummed against her skin.</p><p>She moaned in agreement, her hips grinding back against his member.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve warned you about grinding on my cock before,&rdquo; he breathed, tugging on her nipples a bit more roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tie me up again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might just have to spank you instead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you learned your lesson the first time.&rdquo; He could hear her swallow at the thought. &ldquo;I could get you so worked up with my words, couldn&rsquo;t I? I could tell you how I&rsquo;d bend you over my lap and spank you until your bum is red and you could probably come at the mere thought. Who knew I had such a dirty girl on my hands?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she breathed, getting worked up from the simultaneous stimulation of her mind and her nipples. There was a coil of heat building in her stomach that she just knew was causing arousal to pool between her legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my love,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>That endearing nickname gave her butterflies everytime he said it. It made it so much harder for her to get her words out. &ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be patient,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to be begging for me to fuck you before I let my cock anywhere near your cunt.&rdquo;</p><p>He knew every button push to have her writhing in his arms. His hand dipped down and slid underneath her panties, rubbing around her clitoris. Desperate high pitched moans escaped her as he just kept circling the swollen nub whilst pulling at her sensitive nipples.</p><p>A fire was raging in her core, hot flames licked at her clit as it became overbearingly sensitive. She strained against his touch almost as though she was trying to get away from it but god, did she love the pleasure it brought.</p><p>Severus didn&rsquo;t even need to check whether or not she was wet. He could feel it flooding her panties to the point where his fingers were coated in her juices despite not navigating anywhere near her aching hole. Squeals began to build in her throat as the stimulation of her clitoris continued.</p><p>He left it alone and pushed a single digit into her soaked entrance and wiggled it around before leaving it there unmoving. Her hips began to buck up into his hand and he could feel her pussy twitch and squeeze around it, desperate for her release. A few more thrusts from the girl against his steady hand and she came hard around the finger, the walls pulsing tightly around it.</p><p>&ldquo;Did I say you could come?&rdquo; he asked in a threatening tone. Her pussy clenched again at the sound of his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she said, her voice weak and wavering from her orgasm.</p><p>His cock twitched at her address. They hadn&rsquo;t formally discussed any dominant/submissive agreement but it was obvious that she enjoyed playing with the idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to punish you for that, my love.&rdquo;</p><p>Goosebumps covered her skin. She didn&rsquo;t know if it was from Severus&rsquo; nickname for her or because he had pulled the blankets off, exposing her skin to the cool air. She moaned in agreement and he pulled his finger out, bringing it up to her lips and allowing her to suck her juices off. &ldquo;I want you face down, ass up,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She followed his instruction and felt his hands pull her underwear off. She then felt the material being used to mop up her arousal and then slowly be pushed into her pussy. Her heart raced at the thought, &lsquo;Gods, how humiliating.&rsquo;Her stomach was doing backflips in apprehension of what was about to come.</p><p>His hand started to caress her backside, appreciating the natural curves. A finger slid down between the cheeks, lingering and circling around her puckered asshole. Severus raised his hand and brought it down onto her right cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>He did the same again, this time on the left and this time she moaned out. He was cautious as he continued, wanting to turn her plump ass red but also not wanting it to hurt too much but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. Each one of his harder slaps caused her to moan out. He persisted with the slaps until her cheeks were a nice pink colour.</p><p>He shifted around and kissed the now tender skin. He lay kisses all around before kissing the tight star. He allowed his lips to remain there longer than the other kisses. His tongue darted out and Lyra was surprised at the intrusion.</p><p>Her eyes were shut tightly, focusing on the feeling of his tongue flicking at the hole. As she relaxed into it she found that she enjoyed it, it wasn&rsquo;t a feeling that she could get off to but the thought that her lover was taking pleasure in appreciating every inch of her was nice. He definitely seemed to be enjoying it, showing great enthusiasm during the act.</p><p>It was now Severus&rsquo; time for pleasure, he pulled her panties out and pressed them against her mouth. Hesitantly she took the soaked garment into her mouth and felt Severus&rsquo; cock pressing at her entrance. It was obvious she was too dry to take him in so to warm her back he sucked on his thumb briefly before pressing it against the puckered hole he had been appreciating only a few minutes before.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s asshole gave way easily to the thick digit and she let out a muffled moan. He wiggled his thumb around, even pulling it out slightly before pressing it back in. Lyra&rsquo;s hips thrust back into the movements, wanting more friction. Severus pressed the tip of his cock at her entrance once more, feeling that it was slick with her arousal again he pressed in.</p><p>She gasped at the feeling of his length slowly sliding in and filling her. One hand gripped her hips as he pumped in and out, occasionally pressing his thumb down to stimulate his erection. He groaned at the stimulation, her walls contracting around him as he fucked her.</p><p>Lyra reached down, pressing her face into the mattress to try and get leverage on her clit. She rubbed it fast as Severus pounded her from behind. She screamed as she came, her underwear still stuffed in her mouth absorbing the sound.</p><p>He continued the steady rhythm. In and out of her pulsing pussy. He reached down and removed her panties, discarding them so she could breathe. Her lips were pressed together tightly, she was humming a song of pleasure as he hammered her.</p><p>She flicked her bean once more, desperate to come again. Her pussy was so wet she could hear him sliding in and out of her. She groaned in a mixture of embarrassment and pleasure, her cunt twitching again as she neared release.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait for me,&rdquo; he said, speeding up his pace.</p><p>His movements were purposeful and hard. Each thrust reaching deep inside her. He could feel her quaking around him, trying to stave off her orgasm. Her fingers left her clitoris, instead desperately gripping the bed sheets in an attempt to keep herself upright and bracing herself from his onslaught. She tried to resist, yet despite the decreased stimulation she came hard once more with an exasperated moan.</p><p>She shuddered, her body twitching under him, wanting to give way. The walls around Severus&rsquo; cock were milking him and with a few more thrusts he came deep inside her. He rolled to the side as Lyra&rsquo;s body collapsed onto the bed.</p><p>He pulled her close once more, their bodies covered in a sheen of sweat. Lyra was panting but soon her breathing steadied and the two surrendered to sleep.</p><p>The morning after was filled with peppered kisses. Lyra had awoken before Severus and unleashed her love on the man&rsquo;s exposed body. He awoke with a smile, happy to see his love laying in bed with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, Sevvy,&rdquo; she said, pecking him on the lips.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re usually never this affectionate when you wake up,&rdquo; he pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just happy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want to wake up with you lying next to me every day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That can be arranged,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Her eyes lit up, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can use the floo to go between our rooms,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She bit her lip and nodded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love that.&rdquo;</p><p>He hummed in agreeance, &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>The pair remained in bed together until they decided it was time to get up. After searching through the bare and dirty cupboard in the Snape House she decided to quickly apparate to Diagon Alley for a few supplies. She was back after a few minutes, a few eggs and bacon in tow. Lyra pulled out her wand and began to make breakfast.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Narcissa teach you how to cook too?&rdquo; he asked, watching on from the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I also learnt a few tricks from Uncle Ted and Aunt Andy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Tonks&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I stopped by for Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyebrows were raised, &ldquo;Do Lucius and Narcissa know?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;They&rsquo;d throw me to the curb if they knew. I only saw them just the once but they were nice. The sisters are still very bitter about everything that happened.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus felt enlightened by the new addition of information. Maybe there was still hope to sway Lyra onto the Order&rsquo;s side if she still looked to her mother&rsquo;s estranged sister as family.</p><p>She came and sat down next to him, serving the simple breakfast of bacon and eggs. For some reason it tasted better than anything he had ever eaten before. Maybe it was the company that was present, maybe it was because she made it, maybe she had spiked it with love potion. These were just theories going through Severus&rsquo; head as he watched her as she flicked through the copy of the Daily Prophet she had picked up that morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Gustav is going to be meeting me in Hogsmeade for an interview,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;In about an hour or so. Then I&rsquo;ve got to write my paper and send it off to be published.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus nodded, his heart sinking a little. He had hoped that he would have the opportunity to spend the whole weekend with her but he did enjoy the day they had together. Once they finished eating they apparated into Hogsmeade and killed some time browsing the shops. As it inched closer to the meeting time, the two made their way to the Three Broomsticks.</p><p>Gustav was early, he was wrapped up in a brown winter coat, complimented by a red scarf. He beamed at Lyra, waving at her as he made his way over.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra!&rdquo; he said enthusiastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Gustav!&rdquo; she pulled him into a hug. When separating she introduced her to Severus. &ldquo;This is my friend, Severus. He teaches Potions at Hogwarts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Severus,&rdquo; Gustav repeated, offering him a hand. &ldquo;My pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus gave a curt nod to the man whilst taking his hand. &ldquo;I will take this opportunity to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go?&rdquo; Lyra asked with a confused expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I have to prepare for my classes,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Lyra frowned, &ldquo;I was hoping you&rsquo;d stay, I mean you helped me with the cure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was your brilliant mind that did all the work,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; she sighed, pulling him into a hug. &ldquo;You better come around tonight or I&rsquo;ll be knocking down your door.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and left.</p><p>&ldquo;Boyfriend?&rdquo; Gustav asked.</p><p>Lyra smiled, exhaling a small laugh. She shook her head, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just colleagues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you are,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;And Syrin is just my housemate.&rdquo;</p><p>She rolled her eyes, &ldquo;Can I get you a drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just firewhisky thanks,&rdquo; he replied as he took a seat.</p><p>Lyra returned with two drinks in hand and he prompted her to go on a detailed spiel about the research she had carried out from start to finish. Once he had enough information for the article the two relaxed and began to chat.</p><p>&ldquo;So how&rsquo;s the wedding planning going?&rdquo; Lyra asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve had to push it forward a bit,&rdquo; Gustav replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be April 20th.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh wow, that&rsquo;s like two months away,&rdquo; Lyra commented, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not much time to get ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, um, Syrin is pregnant,&rdquo; Gustav said.</p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; she said excitedly pulling Gustav into a hug.</p><p>He gave a sheepish laugh, &ldquo;Yeah, a bit of a surprise really but you can&rsquo;t help these things. We weren&rsquo;t planning on having kids for a while. It sort of screws up plans for Syrin career wise.&rdquo; Lyra frowned. &ldquo;But this article with you should be big,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I really appreciate you asking me to cover it. I think it&rsquo;ll pay well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problems,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve seen the idiot they sent from the Prophet. She started interviewing the wrong person then was shocked when she found out I was the one who discovered it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Skeeter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re familiar?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only the worst journalist in Britain,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;Yet somehow she&rsquo;s the most famous. I don&rsquo;t know how anyone reads anything she writes, it rarely has any substance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt she&rsquo;ll try and spin some bullshit story out of our interaction,&rdquo; Lyra groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stress too much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you sound like an angel.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a difficult task but no one is as good as you.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled at her compliment, &ldquo;Thanks Lyra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping you pump out the article before she does,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I will,&rdquo; Gustav said, slinging back the rest of his firewhiskey.</p>",

Her past haunts her and she relies on her old Potions teacher for help but what will happen when they get too close for comfort? <br /></i></p>\n<p><i><b>Rated: </b>E for graphic sex scenes in THIS and later chapters.

The cobblestone streets were lined with brick terraced houses that looked as though they had been copied and pasted a million times over to fill the streets. The street lights where the witch and wizard stood were out, prompting the man to pull out his wand and the tip lit up. He walked towards the house that stood in front of them and the woman followed closely behind.</p>\n<p>Severus opened the door and the two entered, the floor creaking as it took their weight. He flicked his wand upwards, illuminating the room with a small oil lamp. They had entered directly into the living room which was decorated rather poorly and much like the street, it looked rather worn. Lyra&rsquo;s eyes were drawn to the walls first, there were stacks of books lining them all bound in leather. She wondered whether they were muggle or magical but she couldn&rsquo;t read them in the poor light. There was a small fireplace and in front of it sat an armchair, a sofa and a small coffee table.</p>\n</p>",
