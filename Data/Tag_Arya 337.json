If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught her, and she\u2019d be with Robb and her mother by now.\u00a0<br/></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she shouted. Her voice sounded thin and scared, a little girl\u2019s voice. \u201cRobb\u2019s just in the castle, and my mother. The gate\u2019s even open.\u201d There were no more Freys riding out. I came so far. \u201cWe have to go get my mother.\u201d<br/><br/>- Arya XI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>She also has faith that her mother will make things better. Not just for her, but for others. There is a level at which Arya is convinced her mother shares her own idea of justice.</p><blockquote><p>Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely. \u201cAnd if we did escape, where would we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinterfell,\u201d she said at once. \u201cI\u2019d tell Mother how you helped me, and you could stay\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>- Arya IX, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>And she\u2019s fiercely defensive of Catelyn.</p><blockquote><p>She had promised Harwin that she would not try and run away again, she knew, but that was before they started telling lies about her mother.<br/></p><p>- Arya IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He looked at her uncomfortably. \u201cMy aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so. He loved my lady mother.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe should go back,\u201d she suddenly decided. \u201cWe should go back to the Twins and get my mother. She can\u2019t be dead. We have to help her.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Arya XII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That night she went to sleep thinking of her mother, and wondering if she should kill the Hound in his sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn herself. When she closed her eyes she saw her mother\u2019s face against the back of her eyelids. She\u2019s so close I could almost smell her\u2026<br/></p><p>- Arya XII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>So as much as Arya fears that her mother won\u2019t understand the things she\u2019s done to survive, this distress is because she loves her. She admires Catelyn, no matter how much Arya chafed in the role her parents (<i>both</i>\u00a0her parents) wanted her to play. Following Catelyn\u2019s death, there\u2019s no coincidence she chooses the name <i>Cat</i>\u00a0when the House of Black and White want her to choose a persona.</p><p>With Sansa, even though Catelyn didn\u2019t educate Sansa politically, it\u2019s clear that she modelled strength and courtesy for her.</p><blockquote><p>She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again.<br/></p><p>- Sansa IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>Sansa associates her mother with strength, above all.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa quailed. Now, she told herself, I must do it now. Gods give me courage. She took one step, then another. Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass, and she felt the weight of their eyes on her. I must be as strong as my lady mother.<br/></p><p>- Sansa V, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>She fears for her mother and Robb acutely.</p><blockquote><p>Is it true? she wondered. Would the gods be so cruel? Her mother was one of Joffrey\u2019s enemies now, her brother Robb another. Her father had died by the king\u2019s command. Must Robb and her lady mother die next?<br/></p><p>- Sansa I, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Sansa has less psychological room to express her affections for her family, but one of the great tensions of her plot is how she remains loyal to her family when surrounded by their enemies.</p><p>And much like Arya, following Catelyn\u2019s death, she still seeks to honour her memory by using Catelyn\u2019s name.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWell, you can scarcely be my trueborn daughter. I\u2019ve never taken a wife, that\u2019s well known. What should you be called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I could call myself after my mother\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatelyn?

Do you like it?\u201d<br/></p><p>- Sansa VI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>She shows the same instinct to defend her mother as her sister does, as well.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYes, your mother, your precious mother, my own sweet sister Catelyn. Don\u2019t you think to play the innocent with me, you vile little liar. All those years in Riverrun, she played with Petyr as if he were her little toy. She teased him with smiles and soft words and wanton looks, and made his nights a torment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My mother is dead, she wanted to shriek. She was your own sister, and she\u2019s dead. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Sansa VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Again, positive by implication. Sansa loves and admires her mother.</p><p>Similarly, with Bran - we all seeing the pattern, here?</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whose stories they are,\u201d Bran told her, \u201cI hate them.\u201d He didn\u2019t want stories and he didn\u2019t want Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father.<br/></p><p>- Bran IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother Jon.<br/></p><p>- Bran IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. \u201cWas the bird from Mother? Is she coming home?\u201d<br/></p><p>- Bran V, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran shivered. \u201cI wish Mother was back,\u201d he said miserably.<br/></p><p>- Bran V, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And now they are all gone. It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away, the girls to captivity, Jon to the Wall, Robb and Mother to war, King Robert and Father to their graves, and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well\u2026<br/></p><p>- Bran III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as acorn paste. The first spoonful was the hardest to get down. He almost retched it right back up. The second tasted better. The third was almost sweet. The rest he spooned up eagerly. Why had he thought that it was bitter? It tasted of honey, of new-fallen snow, of pepper and cinnamon and the last kiss his mother ever gave him.<br/></p><p>- Bran III, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This sure doesn\u2019t <i>seem</i> like the Starklings could barely stand their mum. It looks to me much more like they adored her and drew considerable comfort and strength from her presence in their lives. Whatever their differences with her, an entirely normal part of human relationships, each Starkling comes down firmly on the side of <i>wanting Catelyn back.</i></p><p>For her part, Catelyn\u2019s own driving motivation is to protect her family. Her attempts to get Arya and Sansa back are a key part of her plot, as are her fears for them.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay it willingly.[\u201d]<br/></p><p>- Catelyn I, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>How they loved to promise heads, these men who would be king. &ldquo;Your brother promised me the same. But if truth be told, I would sooner have my daughters back, and leave justice to the gods. Cersei still holds my Sansa, and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Robert\u2019s death.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Catelyn III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no mention of Arya,\u201d Robb pointed out, miserable.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VIII, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa, but not Arya. That might mean anything. Arya had always been harder to tame. Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade her in open court for fear of what she might say or do. They might have her locked safely out of sight. Or they might have killed her. Catelyn shoved the thought away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VI, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cNo word of this must leave Riverrun,\u201d her brother Edmure said. \u201cLord Tywin would\u2026the Lannisters pay their debts, they are always saying that. Mother have mercy, when he hears.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>Sansa. Catelyn\u2019s nails dug into the soft flesh of her palms, so hard did she close her hand.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn III, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Catelyn remembered the twisted little man she had seized at the crossroads inn and carried all the way to the Eyrie. &quot;I should have let Lysa push him out her Moon Door. My poor sweet Sansa\u2026why would anyone do this to her?\u201d<br/></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Her separation - first temporary, then permanent - from her youngest two is also a cause of significant distress to her.</p><blockquote><p>Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls.\u00a0<br/></p><p>- Catelyn III, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI have done everything I can for Bran,\u201d she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. \u201cHis life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Catelyn III, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Fate drives me south and south again, Catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea, when it is north I should be going, north to home. She had written to Bran and Rickon, that last night at Riverrun. I do not forget you, my sweet ones, you must believe that. It is only that your brother needs me more.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn II, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She knelt before the Mother. \u201cMy lady, look down on this battle with a mother\u2019s eyes. They are all sons, every one. Spare them if you can, and spare my own sons as well. Watch over Robb and Bran and Rickon. Would that I were with them.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of her eldest daughter, kneeling here before her. I have come so many thousands of leagues, and for what? Who have I served? I have lost my daughters, Robb does not want me, and Bran and Rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural mother.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>When she believes they\u2019ve been murdered, her grief precipitates some drastic action in freeing Jaime. It\u2019s overpowering and persistent. As you\u2019d expect.</p><blockquote><p>Brienne\u2019s face was a watery blur. She reached across the table, but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn\u2019s, as if the touch might be unwelcome. \u201cI\u2026there are no words, my lady. My good lady. Your sons, they\u2026they\u2019re with the gods now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d Catelyn said sharply. \u201cWhat god would let this happen? Rickon was only a baby. How could he deserve such a death? And Bran\u2026when I left the north, he had not opened his eyes since his fall. I had to go before he woke. Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There was a smell of death about that room; a heavy smell, sweet and foul, clinging. It reminded her of the sons that she had lost, her sweet Bran and her little Rickon, slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy, who had been Ned\u2019s ward. She still grieved for Ned, she would always grieve for Ned, but to have her babies taken as well \u2026 \u201cIt is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child,\u201d she whispered softly, more to herself than to her father.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn I, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran and Rickon will be waiting for him, Catelyn thought sadly, as once I used to wait.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Her love for her younger children is apparent at every turn. As well as her love for her eldest, and her husband.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn II, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>Three kids, three different relationships. Trust in Sansa\u2019s talents, concern for Arya\u2019s future, protectiveness of Bran. Love on all three counts.\u00a0That\u2019s shown in how she thinks of her children.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMychel\u2019s my love,\u201d Mya explained. \u201cMychel Redfort. He\u2019s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray. We\u2019re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn smiled, but the smile was tinged with sadness.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VI, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cSansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft \u2026 the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.</p><p>&quot;And Arya, well\u2026Ned\u2019s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced. Arya was a trial, it must be said. Half a boy and half a wolf pup. Forbid her anything and it became her heart\u2019s desire. She had Ned\u2019s long face, and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it. I despaired of ever making a lady of her. She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into her head. I think she must be dead too.\u201d When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI am always proud of Bran,\u201d Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>- Catelyn I, AGoT<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I cannot blame them, Catelyn thought. They do not know. And if they did, why should they care? They never knew my sons. Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats, pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one, never heard him laugh, never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>This is what she wants. Her family.</p><blockquote><p>As she slept amidst the rolling grasslands, Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again, that Arya and Sansa held hands, that Rickon was still a babe at her breast. Robb, crownless, played with a wooden sword, and when all were safe asleep, she found Ned in her bed, smiling.</p><p>Sweet it was, sweet and gone too soon.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn II, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken, and asked that he give her sweet Bran his protection. She went to the Maid and beseeched her to lend her courage to Arya and Sansa, to guard them in their innocence. To the Father, she prayed for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it, and she asked the Warrior to keep Robb strong and shield him in his battles.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Having established this, yes, basically, the lack of interaction between Catelyn and her younger PoV children is deliberate. I do feel it\u2019s a weakness early on, when GRRM\u2019s busy establishing relationships. He could have done that better. But later on, when we get to the meat of Catelyn\u2019s arc, her separation from her family is the <i>point</i>.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI keep remembering the Stark words. Winter has come, Father. For me. For me. Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters, and for what? For a gold hat and an iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough. I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons. I want Bran and Rickon back, I want\u2026\u201d Catelyn hung her head. \u201cI want,\u201d she said once more, and then her words were gone.<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She clutched tight at his hand. \u201cNothing will happen to you. Nothing. I could not stand it. They took Ned, and your sweet brothers. Sansa is married, Arya is lost, my father\u2019s dead\u2026if anything befell you, I would go mad, Robb. You are all I have left.\u201d<br/></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not a happy one.</p><blockquote><p>It hurts so much, she thought. Our children, Ned, all our sweet babes. Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb\u2026Robb\u2026please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting\u2026<br/></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>We can\u2019t get this if we have Catelyn interacting regularly on page with Sansa, Arya, Bran, or Rickon.</p><p>I would also strongly disagree that what GRRM says about Catelyn\u00a0\u201cusually\u201d conflicts with what we\u2019re shown. I think the only such case is with <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/165424008727/hi-as-someone-emotionally-abused-by-a-parent-and\">her treatment of Jon Snow</a>. Otherwise, he tells us that Catelyn\u2019s smart and capable, and he shows us that she\u2019s <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/160827696482/catelyn-smart\">smart and capable</a>, <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/168750213542/a-few-people-in-my-inbox-asking-if-i-could-explain\">albeit unlucky</a>. He tells us that Catelyn loves her family, and he shows us Catelyn loves her family. He tells us Catelyn\u2019s family loves her, and he shows us Catelyn\u2019s family loves her. Not seeing much in the way of mismatch here.</p>",

It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away, the girls to captivity, Jon to the Wall, Robb and Mother to war, King Robert and Father to their graves, and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well\u2026<br></p><p>- Bran III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as acorn paste. The first spoonful was the hardest to get down. He almost retched it right back up. The second tasted better. The third was almost sweet. The rest he spooned up eagerly. Why had he thought that it was bitter? It tasted of honey, of new-fallen snow, of pepper and cinnamon and the last kiss his mother ever gave him.<br></p><p>- Bran III, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This sure doesn\u2019t <i>seem</i> like the Starklings could barely stand their mum. It looks to me much more like they adored her and drew considerable comfort and strength from her presence in their lives. Whatever their differences with her, an entirely normal part of human relationships, each Starkling comes down firmly on the side of <i>wanting Catelyn back.</i></p><p>For her part, Catelyn\u2019s own driving motivation is to protect her family. Her attempts to get Arya and Sansa back are a key part of her plot, as are her fears for them.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay it willingly.[\u201d]<br></p><p>- Catelyn I, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>How they loved to promise heads, these men who would be king. \u201cYour brother promised me the same. But if truth be told, I would sooner have my daughters back, and leave justice to the gods. Cersei still holds my Sansa, and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Robert\u2019s death.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no mention of Arya,\u201d Robb pointed out, miserable.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VIII, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa, but not Arya. That might mean anything. Arya had always been harder to tame. Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade her in open court for fear of what she might say or do. They might have her locked safely out of sight. Or they might have killed her. Catelyn shoved the thought away.\u00a0<br></p><p>- Catelyn VI, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cNo word of this must leave Riverrun,\u201d her brother Edmure said. \u201cLord Tywin would\u2026the Lannisters pay their debts, they are always saying that. Mother have mercy, when he hears.\"\u00a0</p><p>Sansa. Catelyn\u2019s nails dug into the soft flesh of her palms, so hard did she close her hand.<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Catelyn remembered the twisted little man she had seized at the crossroads inn and carried all the way to the Eyrie. \"I should have let Lysa push him out her Moon Door. My poor sweet Sansa\u2026why would anyone do this to her?\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Her separation - first temporary, then permanent - from her youngest two is also a cause of significant distress to her.</p><blockquote><p>Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls.\u00a0<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI have done everything I can for Bran,\u201d she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. \u201cHis life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Fate drives me south and south again, Catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea, when it is north I should be going, north to home. She had written to Bran and Rickon, that last night at Riverrun. I do not forget you, my sweet ones, you must believe that. It is only that your brother needs me more.<br></p><p>- Catelyn II, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She knelt before the Mother. \u201cMy lady, look down on this battle with a mother\u2019s eyes. They are all sons, every one. Spare them if you can, and spare my own sons as well. Watch over Robb and Bran and Rickon. Would that I were with them.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of her eldest daughter, kneeling here before her. I have come so many thousands of leagues, and for what? Who have I served? I have lost my daughters, Robb does not want me, and Bran and Rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural mother.<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>When she believes they\u2019ve been murdered, her grief precipitates some drastic action in freeing Jaime. It\u2019s overpowering and persistent. As you\u2019d expect.</p><blockquote><p>Brienne\u2019s face was a watery blur. She reached across the table, but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn\u2019s, as if the touch might be unwelcome. \u201cI\u2026there are no words, my lady. My good lady. Your sons, they\u2026they\u2019re with the gods now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d Catelyn said sharply. \u201cWhat god would let this happen? Rickon was only a baby. How could he deserve such a death? And Bran\u2026when I left the north, he had not opened his eyes since his fall. I had to go before he woke. Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There was a smell of death about that room; a heavy smell, sweet and foul, clinging. It reminded her of the sons that she had lost, her sweet Bran and her little Rickon, slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy, who had been Ned\u2019s ward. She still grieved for Ned, she would always grieve for Ned, but to have her babies taken as well \u2026 \u201cIt is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child,\u201d she whispered softly, more to herself than to her father.<br></p><p>- Catelyn I, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran and Rickon will be waiting for him, Catelyn thought sadly, as once I used to wait.<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Her love for her younger children is apparent at every turn. As well as her love for her eldest, and her husband.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran.<br></p><p>- Catelyn II, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>Three kids, three different relationships. Trust in Sansa\u2019s talents, concern for Arya\u2019s future, protectiveness of Bran. Love on all three counts.\u00a0That\u2019s shown in how she thinks of her children.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMychel\u2019s my love,\u201d Mya explained. \u201cMychel Redfort. He\u2019s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray. We\u2019re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn smiled, but the smile was tinged with sadness.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VI, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cSansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft \u2026 the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.</p><p>\"And Arya, well\u2026Ned\u2019s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced. Arya was a trial, it must be said. Half a boy and half a wolf pup. Forbid her anything and it became her heart\u2019s desire. She had Ned\u2019s long face, and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it. I despaired of ever making a lady of her. She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into her head. I think she must be dead too.\u201d When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI am always proud of Bran,\u201d Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it.\u00a0<br></p><p>- Catelyn I, AGoT<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I cannot blame them, Catelyn thought. They do not know. And if they did, why should they care? They never knew my sons. Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats, pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one, never heard him laugh, never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>This is what she wants. Her family.</p><blockquote><p>As she slept amidst the rolling grasslands, Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again, that Arya and Sansa held hands, that Rickon was still a babe at her breast. Robb, crownless, played with a wooden sword, and when all were safe asleep, she found Ned in her bed, smiling.</p><p>Sweet it was, sweet and gone too soon.<br></p><p>- Catelyn II, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken, and asked that he give her sweet Bran his protection. She went to the Maid and beseeched her to lend her courage to Arya and Sansa, to guard them in their innocence. To the Father, she prayed for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it, and she asked the Warrior to keep Robb strong and shield him in his battles.<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Having established this, yes, basically, the lack of interaction between Catelyn and her younger PoV children is deliberate. I do feel it\u2019s a weakness early on, when GRRM\u2019s busy establishing relationships. He could have done that better. But later on, when we get to the meat of Catelyn\u2019s arc, her separation from her family is the <i>point</i>.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI keep remembering the Stark words. Winter has come, Father. For me. For me. Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters, and for what? For a gold hat and an iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough. I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons. I want Bran and Rickon back, I want\u2026\u201d Catelyn hung her head. \u201cI want,\u201d she said once more, and then her words were gone.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She clutched tight at his hand. \u201cNothing will happen to you. Nothing. I could not stand it. They took Ned, and your sweet brothers. Sansa is married, Arya is lost, my father\u2019s dead\u2026if anything befell you, I would go mad, Robb. You are all I have left.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not a happy one.</p><blockquote><p>It hurts so much, she thought. Our children, Ned, all our sweet babes. Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb\u2026Robb\u2026please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting\u2026<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>We can\u2019t get this if we have Catelyn interacting regularly on page with Sansa, Arya, Bran, or Rickon.</p><p>I would also strongly disagree that what GRRM says about Catelyn\u00a0\u201cusually\u201d conflicts with what we\u2019re shown. I think the only such case is with <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/165424008727/hi-as-someone-emotionally-abused-by-a-parent-and\">her treatment of Jon Snow</a>. Otherwise, he tells us that Catelyn\u2019s smart and capable, and he shows us that she\u2019s <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/160827696482/catelyn-smart\">smart and capable</a>, <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/168750213542/a-few-people-in-my-inbox-asking-if-i-could-explain\">albeit unlucky</a>. He tells us that Catelyn loves her family, and he shows us Catelyn loves her family. He tells us Catelyn\u2019s family loves her, and he shows us Catelyn\u2019s family loves her. Not seeing much in the way of mismatch here.</p>",

This is going to get long. <i>Really</i>\u00a0long. Buckle up. I\u2019ve got my receipts.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Arya is desperate to get back to her mother. It\u2019s her freaking <i>driving motivation</i>\u00a0for most of ASoS.</p><blockquote><p>She yearned to see her mother again, and Robb and Bran and Rickon\u2026but it was Jon Snow she thought of most.<br></p><p>- Arya I, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Things change, here, though, and as the attack on Yoren\u2019s party dashes her hopes of quickly returning to Winterfell, Arya focuses in on the family members closer to her.</p><blockquote><p>When she thought of seeing Robb\u2019s face again Arya had to bite her lip. And I want to see Jon too, and Bran and Rickon, and Mother.<br></p><p>- Arya VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>His words beat at her ears like the pounding of a drum, and suddenly it was more than Arya could stand. She wanted Riverrun, not Acorn Hall; she wanted her mother and her brother Robb, not Lady Smallwood or some uncle she never knew.<br></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She would have been better alone. If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught her, and she\u2019d be with Robb and her mother by now.\u00a0<br></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she shouted. Her voice sounded thin and scared, a little girl\u2019s voice. \u201cRobb\u2019s just in the castle, and my mother. The gate\u2019s even open.\u201d There were no more Freys riding out. I came so far. \u201cWe have to go get my mother.\u201d<br><br>- Arya XI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>She also has faith that her mother will make things better. Not just for her, but for others. There is a level at which Arya is convinced her mother shares her own idea of justice.</p><blockquote><p>Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely. \u201cAnd if we did escape, where would we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinterfell,\u201d she said at once. \u201cI\u2019d tell Mother how you helped me, and you could stay\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>- Arya IX, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>And she\u2019s fiercely defensive of Catelyn.</p><blockquote><p>She had promised Harwin that she would not try and run away again, she knew, but that was before they started telling lies about her mother.<br></p><p>- Arya IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He looked at her uncomfortably. \u201cMy aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so. He loved my lady mother.\u201d<br></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe should go back,\u201d she suddenly decided. \u201cWe should go back to the Twins and get my mother. She can\u2019t be dead. We have to help her.\u201d<br></p><p>- Arya XII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That night she went to sleep thinking of her mother, and wondering if she should kill the Hound in his sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn herself. When she closed her eyes she saw her mother\u2019s face against the back of her eyelids. She\u2019s so close I could almost smell her\u2026<br></p><p>- Arya XII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>So as much as Arya fears that her mother won\u2019t understand the things she\u2019s done to survive, this distress is because she loves her. She admires Catelyn, no matter how much Arya chafed in the role her parents (<i>both</i>\u00a0her parents) wanted her to play. Following Catelyn\u2019s death, there\u2019s no coincidence she chooses the name <i>Cat</i>\u00a0when the House of Black and White want her to choose a persona.</p><p>With Sansa, even though Catelyn didn\u2019t educate Sansa politically, it\u2019s clear that she modelled strength and courtesy for her.</p><blockquote><p>She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again.<br></p><p>- Sansa IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>Sansa associates her mother with strength, above all.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa quailed. Now, she told herself, I must do it now. Gods give me courage. She took one step, then another. Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass, and she felt the weight of their eyes on her. I must be as strong as my lady mother.<br></p><p>- Sansa V, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>She fears for her mother and Robb acutely.</p><blockquote><p>Is it true? she wondered. Would the gods be so cruel? Her mother was one of Joffrey\u2019s enemies now, her brother Robb another. Her father had died by the king\u2019s command. Must Robb and her lady mother die next?<br></p><p>- Sansa I, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Sansa has less psychological room to express her affections for her family, but one of the great tensions of her plot is how she remains loyal to her family when surrounded by their enemies.</p><p>And much like Arya, following Catelyn\u2019s death, she still seeks to honour her memory by using Catelyn\u2019s name.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWell, you can scarcely be my trueborn daughter. I\u2019ve never taken a wife, that\u2019s well known. What should you be called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I could call myself after my mother\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatelyn? A bit too obvious\u2026but after my mother, that would serve. Alayne. Do you like it?\u201d<br></p><p>- Sansa VI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>She shows the same instinct to defend her mother as her sister does, as well.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYes, your mother, your precious mother, my own sweet sister Catelyn. Don\u2019t you think to play the innocent with me, you vile little liar. All those years in Riverrun, she played with Petyr as if he were her little toy. She teased him with smiles and soft words and wanton looks, and made his nights a torment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My mother is dead, she wanted to shriek. She was your own sister, and she\u2019s dead. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br></p><p>- Sansa VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Again, positive by implication. Sansa loves and admires her mother.</p><p>Similarly, with Bran - we all seeing the pattern, here?</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whose stories they are,\u201d Bran told her, \u201cI hate them.\u201d He didn\u2019t want stories and he didn\u2019t want Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father.<br></p><p>- Bran IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother Jon.<br></p><p>- Bran IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. \u201cWas the bird from Mother? Is she coming home?\u201d<br></p><p>- Bran V, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran shivered. \u201cI wish Mother was back,\u201d he said miserably.<br></p><p>- Bran V, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And now they are all gone. It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away, the girls to captivity, Jon to the Wall, Robb and Mother to war, King Robert and Father to their graves, and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well\u2026<br></p><p>- Bran III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as acorn paste. The first spoonful was the hardest to get down. He almost retched it right back up. The second tasted better. The third was almost sweet. The rest he spooned up eagerly. Why had he thought that it was bitter? It tasted of honey, of new-fallen snow, of pepper and cinnamon and the last kiss his mother ever gave him.<br></p><p>- Bran III, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This sure doesn\u2019t <i>seem</i> like the Starklings could barely stand their mum. It looks to me much more like they adored her and drew considerable comfort and strength from her presence in their lives. Whatever their differences with her, an entirely normal part of human relationships, each Starkling comes down firmly on the side of <i>wanting Catelyn back.</i></p><p>For her part, Catelyn\u2019s own driving motivation is to protect her family. Her attempts to get Arya and Sansa back are a key part of her plot, as are her fears for them.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay it willingly.[\u201d]<br></p><p>- Catelyn I, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>How they loved to promise heads, these men who would be king. \u201cYour brother promised me the same. But if truth be told, I would sooner have my daughters back, and leave justice to the gods. Cersei still holds my Sansa, and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Robert\u2019s death.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no mention of Arya,\u201d Robb pointed out, miserable.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VIII, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa, but not Arya. That might mean anything. Arya had always been harder to tame. Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade her in open court for fear of what she might say or do. They might have her locked safely out of sight. Or they might have killed her. Catelyn shoved the thought away.\u00a0<br></p><p>- Catelyn VI, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cNo word of this must leave Riverrun,\u201d her brother Edmure said. \u201cLord Tywin would\u2026the Lannisters pay their debts, they are always saying that. Mother have mercy, when he hears.\"\u00a0</p><p>Sansa. Catelyn\u2019s nails dug into the soft flesh of her palms, so hard did she close her hand.<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Catelyn remembered the twisted little man she had seized at the crossroads inn and carried all the way to the Eyrie. \"I should have let Lysa push him out her Moon Door. My poor sweet Sansa\u2026why would anyone do this to her?\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Her separation - first temporary, then permanent - from her youngest two is also a cause of significant distress to her.</p><blockquote><p>Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls.\u00a0<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI have done everything I can for Bran,\u201d she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. \u201cHis life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn III, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Fate drives me south and south again, Catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea, when it is north I should be going, north to home. She had written to Bran and Rickon, that last night at Riverrun. I do not forget you, my sweet ones, you must believe that. It is only that your brother needs me more.<br></p><p>- Catelyn II, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She knelt before the Mother. \u201cMy lady, look down on this battle with a mother\u2019s eyes. They are all sons, every one. Spare them if you can, and spare my own sons as well. Watch over Robb and Bran and Rickon. Would that I were with them.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of her eldest daughter, kneeling here before her. I have come so many thousands of leagues, and for what? Who have I served? I have lost my daughters, Robb does not want me, and Bran and Rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural mother.<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>When she believes they\u2019ve been murdered, her grief precipitates some drastic action in freeing Jaime. It\u2019s overpowering and persistent. As you\u2019d expect.</p><blockquote><p>Brienne\u2019s face was a watery blur. She reached across the table, but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn\u2019s, as if the touch might be unwelcome. \u201cI\u2026there are no words, my lady. My good lady. Your sons, they\u2026they\u2019re with the gods now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d Catelyn said sharply. \u201cWhat god would let this happen? Rickon was only a baby. How could he deserve such a death? And Bran\u2026when I left the north, he had not opened his eyes since his fall. I had to go before he woke. Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There was a smell of death about that room; a heavy smell, sweet and foul, clinging. It reminded her of the sons that she had lost, her sweet Bran and her little Rickon, slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy, who had been Ned\u2019s ward. She still grieved for Ned, she would always grieve for Ned, but to have her babies taken as well \u2026 \u201cIt is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child,\u201d she whispered softly, more to herself than to her father.<br></p><p>- Catelyn I, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran and Rickon will be waiting for him, Catelyn thought sadly, as once I used to wait.<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Her love for her younger children is apparent at every turn. As well as her love for her eldest, and her husband.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran.<br></p><p>- Catelyn II, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>Three kids, three different relationships. Trust in Sansa\u2019s talents, concern for Arya\u2019s future, protectiveness of Bran. Love on all three counts.\u00a0That\u2019s shown in how she thinks of her children.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMychel\u2019s my love,\u201d Mya explained. \u201cMychel Redfort. He\u2019s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray. We\u2019re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn smiled, but the smile was tinged with sadness.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VI, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cSansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and soft \u2026 the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.</p><p>\"And Arya, well\u2026Ned\u2019s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced. Arya was a trial, it must be said. Half a boy and half a wolf pup. Forbid her anything and it became her heart\u2019s desire. She had Ned\u2019s long face, and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it. I despaired of ever making a lady of her. She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into her head. I think she must be dead too.\u201d When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cI am always proud of Bran,\u201d Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it.\u00a0<br></p><p>- Catelyn I, AGoT<br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I cannot blame them, Catelyn thought. They do not know. And if they did, why should they care? They never knew my sons. Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats, pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one, never heard him laugh, never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>This is what she wants. Her family.</p><blockquote><p>As she slept amidst the rolling grasslands, Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again, that Arya and Sansa held hands, that Rickon was still a babe at her breast. Robb, crownless, played with a wooden sword, and when all were safe asleep, she found Ned in her bed, smiling.</p><p>Sweet it was, sweet and gone too soon.<br></p><p>- Catelyn II, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken, and asked that he give her sweet Bran his protection. She went to the Maid and beseeched her to lend her courage to Arya and Sansa, to guard them in their innocence. To the Father, she prayed for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it, and she asked the Warrior to keep Robb strong and shield him in his battles.<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Having established this, yes, basically, the lack of interaction between Catelyn and her younger PoV children is deliberate. I do feel it\u2019s a weakness early on, when GRRM\u2019s busy establishing relationships. He could have done that better. But later on, when we get to the meat of Catelyn\u2019s arc, her separation from her family is the <i>point</i>.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI keep remembering the Stark words. Winter has come, Father. For me. For me. Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters, and for what? For a gold hat and an iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough. I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons. I want Bran and Rickon back, I want\u2026\u201d Catelyn hung her head. \u201cI want,\u201d she said once more, and then her words were gone.<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She clutched tight at his hand. \u201cNothing will happen to you. Nothing. I could not stand it. They took Ned, and your sweet brothers. Sansa is married, Arya is lost, my father\u2019s dead\u2026if anything befell you, I would go mad, Robb. You are all I have left.\u201d<br></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not a happy one.</p><blockquote><p>It hurts so much, she thought. Our children, Ned, all our sweet babes. Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb\u2026Robb\u2026please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting\u2026<br></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>We can\u2019t get this if we have Catelyn interacting regularly on page with Sansa, Arya, Bran, or Rickon.</p><p>I would also strongly disagree that what GRRM says about Catelyn\u00a0\u201cusually\u201d conflicts with what we\u2019re shown. I think the only such case is with <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/165424008727/hi-as-someone-emotionally-abused-by-a-parent-and\">her treatment of Jon Snow</a>. Otherwise, he tells us that Catelyn\u2019s smart and capable, and he shows us that she\u2019s <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/160827696482/catelyn-smart\">smart and capable</a>, <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/168750213542/a-few-people-in-my-inbox-asking-if-i-could-explain\">albeit unlucky</a>. He tells us that Catelyn loves her family, and he shows us Catelyn loves her family. He tells us Catelyn\u2019s family loves her, and he shows us Catelyn\u2019s family loves her. Not seeing much in the way of mismatch here.</p>",
                "content": "<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair characterisation of Catelyn&rsquo;s relationship with her children at all. Like, <i>at all</i>. I&rsquo;m sorry, anon. This is going to get long. <i>Really</i>&nbsp;long. Buckle up. I&rsquo;ve got my receipts.</p><p>Arya is desperate to get back to her mother. It&rsquo;s her freaking <i>driving motivation</i>&nbsp;for most of ASoS.</p><blockquote><p>She yearned to see her mother again, and Robb and Bran and Rickon&hellip;but it was Jon Snow she thought of most.<br /></p><p>- Arya I, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Things change, here, though, and as the attack on Yoren&rsquo;s party dashes her hopes of quickly returning to Winterfell, Arya focuses in on the family members closer to her.</p><blockquote><p>When she thought of seeing Robb&rsquo;s face again Arya had to bite her lip. And I want to see Jon too, and Bran and Rickon, and Mother.<br /></p><p>- Arya VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>His words beat at her ears like the pounding of a drum, and suddenly it was more than Arya could stand. She wanted Riverrun, not Acorn Hall; she wanted her mother and her brother Robb, not Lady Smallwood or some uncle she never knew.<br /></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She would have been better alone. If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught her, and she&rsquo;d be with Robb and her mother by now.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she shouted. Her voice sounded thin and scared, a little girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Robb&rsquo;s just in the castle, and my mother. The gate&rsquo;s even open.&rdquo; There were no more Freys riding out. I came so far. &ldquo;We have to go get my mother.&rdquo;<br /><br />- Arya XI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>She also has faith that her mother will make things better. Not just for her, but for others. There is a level at which Arya is convinced her mother shares her own idea of justice.</p><blockquote><p>Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely. &ldquo;And if we did escape, where would we go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Winterfell,&rdquo; she said at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell Mother how you helped me, and you could stay&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Arya IX, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>And she&rsquo;s fiercely defensive of Catelyn.</p><blockquote><p>She had promised Harwin that she would not try and run away again, she knew, but that was before they started telling lies about her mother.<br /></p><p>- Arya IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He looked at her uncomfortably. &ldquo;My aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so. He loved my lady mother.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Arya VIII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We should go back,&rdquo; she suddenly decided. &ldquo;We should go back to the Twins and get my mother. She can&rsquo;t be dead. We have to help her.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Arya XII, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That night she went to sleep thinking of her mother, and wondering if she should kill the Hound in his sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn herself. When she closed her eyes she saw her mother&rsquo;s face against the back of her eyelids. She&rsquo;s so close I could almost smell her&hellip;<br /></p><p>- Arya XII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>So as much as Arya fears that her mother won&rsquo;t understand the things she&rsquo;s done to survive, this distress is because she loves her. She admires Catelyn, no matter how much Arya chafed in the role her parents (<i>both</i>&nbsp;her parents) wanted her to play. Following Catelyn&rsquo;s death, there&rsquo;s no coincidence she chooses the name <i>Cat</i>&nbsp;when the House of Black and White want her to choose a persona.</p><p>With Sansa, even though Catelyn didn&rsquo;t educate Sansa politically, it&rsquo;s clear that she modelled strength and courtesy for her.</p><blockquote><p>She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again.<br /></p><p>- Sansa IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>Sansa associates her mother with strength, above all.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa quailed. Now, she told herself, I must do it now. Gods give me courage. She took one step, then another. Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass, and she felt the weight of their eyes on her. I must be as strong as my lady mother.<br /></p><p>- Sansa V, AGoT</p></blockquote><p>She fears for her mother and Robb acutely.</p><blockquote><p>Is it true? she wondered. Would the gods be so cruel? Her mother was one of Joffrey&rsquo;s enemies now, her brother Robb another. Her father had died by the king&rsquo;s command. Must Robb and her lady mother die next?<br /></p><p>- Sansa I, ACoK</p></blockquote><p>Sansa has less psychological room to express her affections for her family, but one of the great tensions of her plot is how she remains loyal to her family when surrounded by their enemies.</p><p>And much like Arya, following Catelyn&rsquo;s death, she still seeks to honour her memory by using Catelyn&rsquo;s name.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Well, you can scarcely be my trueborn daughter. I&rsquo;ve never taken a wife, that&rsquo;s well known. What should you be called?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I could call myself after my mother&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Catelyn? A bit too obvious&hellip;but after my mother, that would serve. Alayne. Do you like it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Sansa VI, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>She shows the same instinct to defend her mother as her sister does, as well.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yes, your mother, your precious mother, my own sweet sister Catelyn. Don&rsquo;t you think to play the innocent with me, you vile little liar. All those years in Riverrun, she played with Petyr as if he were her little toy. She teased him with smiles and soft words and wanton looks, and made his nights a torment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; My mother is dead, she wanted to shriek. She was your own sister, and she&rsquo;s dead. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t. She wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Sansa VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>Again, positive by implication. Sansa loves and admires her mother.</p><p>Similarly, with Bran - we all seeing the pattern, here?</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whose stories they are,&rdquo; Bran told her, &ldquo;I hate them.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t want stories and he didn&rsquo;t want Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father.<br /></p><p>- Bran IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother Jon.<br /></p><p>- Bran IV, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. &ldquo;Was the bird from Mother? Is she coming home?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Bran V, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran shivered. &ldquo;I wish Mother was back,&rdquo; he said miserably.<br /></p><p>- Bran V, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And now they are all gone. It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away, the girls to captivity, Jon to the Wall, Robb and Mother to war, King Robert and Father to their graves, and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well&hellip;<br /></p><p>- Bran III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as acorn paste. The first spoonful was the hardest to get down. He almost retched it right back up. The second tasted better. The third was almost sweet. The rest he spooned up eagerly. Why had he thought that it was bitter? It tasted of honey, of new-fallen snow, of pepper and cinnamon and the last kiss his mother ever gave him.<br /></p><p>- Bran III, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>This sure doesn&rsquo;t <i>seem</i> like the Starklings could barely stand their mum. It looks to me much more like they adored her and drew considerable comfort and strength from her presence in their lives. Whatever their differences with her, an entirely normal part of human relationships, each Starkling comes down firmly on the side of <i>wanting Catelyn back.</i></p><p>For her part, Catelyn&rsquo;s own driving motivation is to protect her family. Her attempts to get Arya and Sansa back are a key part of her plot, as are her fears for them.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay it willingly.[&rdquo;]<br /></p><p>- Catelyn I, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>How they loved to promise heads, these men who would be king. &ldquo;Your brother promised me the same. But if truth be told, I would sooner have my daughters back, and leave justice to the gods. Cersei still holds my Sansa, and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Robert&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Catelyn III, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mention of Arya,&rdquo; Robb pointed out, miserable.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here.<br /></p><p>- Catelyn VIII, AGoT</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sansa, but not Arya. That might mean anything. Arya had always been harder to tame. Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade her in open court for fear of what she might say or do. They might have her locked safely out of sight. Or they might have killed her. Catelyn shoved the thought away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>- Catelyn VI, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No word of this must leave Riverrun,&rdquo; her brother Edmure said. &ldquo;Lord Tywin would&hellip;the Lannisters pay their debts, they are always saying that. Mother have mercy, when he hears.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa. Catelyn&rsquo;s nails dug into the soft flesh of her palms, so hard did she close her hand.<br /></p><p>- Catelyn III, ASoS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Catelyn remembered the twisted little man she had seized at the crossroads inn and carried all the way to the Eyrie. \"I should have let Lysa push him out her Moon Door.

It is only that your brother needs me more.<br /></p><p>- Catelyn II, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She knelt before the Mother. &ldquo;My lady, look down on this battle with a mother&rsquo;s eyes.

I want Bran and Rickon back, I want&hellip;&rdquo; Catelyn hung her head. &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; she said once more, and then her words were gone.<br /></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ACoK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She clutched tight at his hand. &ldquo;Nothing will happen to you. Nothing. I could not stand it. They took Ned, and your sweet brothers. Sansa is married, Arya is lost, my father&rsquo;s dead&hellip;if anything befell you, I would go mad, Robb. You are all I have left.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>- Catelyn IV, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not a happy one.</p><blockquote><p>It hurts so much, she thought. Our children, Ned, all our sweet babes. Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb&hellip;Robb&hellip;please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting&hellip;<br /></p><p>- Catelyn VII, ASoS</p></blockquote><p>We can&rsquo;t get this if we have Catelyn interacting regularly on page with Sansa, Arya, Bran, or Rickon.</p><p>I would also strongly disagree that what GRRM says about Catelyn&nbsp;&ldquo;usually&rdquo; conflicts with what we&rsquo;re shown. I think the only such case is with <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/165424008727/hi-as-someone-emotionally-abused-by-a-parent-and\">her treatment of Jon Snow</a>. Otherwise, he tells us that Catelyn&rsquo;s smart and capable, and he shows us that she&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/160827696482/catelyn-smart\">smart and capable</a>, <a href=\"http://turtle-paced.tumblr.com/post/168750213542/a-few-people-in-my-inbox-asking-if-i-could-explain\">albeit unlucky</a>. He tells us that Catelyn loves her family, and he shows us Catelyn loves her family. He tells us Catelyn&rsquo;s family loves her, and he shows us Catelyn&rsquo;s family loves her. Not seeing much in the way of mismatch here.</p>",

I mean yes they haven\u2018t seen each other for years and they\u2018ve both changed throughout their time apart, especially Arya. But that doesn\u2018t make them any less compatible. In fact they may be even more compatible now. S7 proved that tbh. They are both stubborn, headstrong, they kind of have their own way of things and don\u2018t just let others tell them what to do. They both don\u2018t shy away from violence and would choose violence over diplomacy. That has been made clear when Arya just wanted to fight anyone who\u2018s against Jon instead of negotiating with them, what Sansa preferred. And Gendry just killed the Goldcloaks instead of letting Davos handle it with some smooth talking. It doesn\u2018t even end here. They even have shared interests like their hatred for the Lannisters, they would like to see them all dead. And they\u2018re both eager to fight in the upcoming wars. So the compatibility is there. And their chemistry will propably also be amazing since they already had great chemistry in the earlier seasons. Physically they make a great match, they both have badass looks, Gendry with his warhammer and the short-cut hair and Arya with her dagger and the cool hairstyle. And I think the differences they have will only make them feel even more attracted to each other. On one side Arya has become much more quiet and reserved, she has a very intriguing and elusive aura and Gendry is a man that is easily intrigued and would be captivated by her mysterious, enigmatic appearance. On the other side Gendry is much more extroverted and I think Arya would like his confident and rough presence. All in all I believe there is nothing that would take away their compatibility, they really are well-matched.</p>",

His suggestion would only end up with them getting in more trouble. Because their excuse that they were \u201cjust leaving\u201d had not saved them from the biggest earful they had all received since they were children. Gendry was very surprised that the clerk had not simply ejected them entirely. Instead, they were placed inside an actual room, as if to put them in time out. Or maybe to remove the negative influence. Regardless, all Gendry truly wanted to do was get his face stitched up. And go home.<b><br/></b></p><p>That was a lie. He wanted to say. He wanted to see the girl with the eyes and the mouth and nose again. Arya Stark he reminded himself. Regardless of the lecture they had received, it had still been worth it. Well, it had been worth one time getting in trouble. Getting in trouble twice, as Lommy was suggesting, his hands on the door handle, about to pull the door free. \u201cThey are right next door Gendry! I saw them through the crack in the door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you looking into someone else\u2019s hospital room? What if someone had been I don\u2019t know, giving birth in there!\u201d Gendry protested louder. His voice loud was kind of scary he knew. But Lommy and Hot Pie had known him for too long to be scared. </p><p>\u201cAlways gotta know your surroundin\u2019s Gen,\u201d Hot Pie said with a smile, standing up from his stool and moving over towards the door. Gendry shook his head, muttering that that was a dumb nickname. Now that they both thought it was a good idea it was going to happen. Gendry stood, his head pounding with both pain and the thought of seeing her face again. It had to be one of the most beautiful he had ever seen. With his seeming agreement, Lommy opened the door and they all exited into the hallway, stealthily walking a few yards to the other door, where at once Lommy and Hot Pie put their ears to the door. Gendry scowled, of course they had to be the ones listening. Weren\u2019t they just looking to hook him up? It was seconds before Hot Pie\u2019s face lit up, excited and exhilarated, and Lommy\u2019s grin became almost devious. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s totally fucking into you dude,\u201d Lommy whispered. Gendry\u2019s eyes widened. He had been sure that he would have been forgotten in an instant. Of course, now that they had done a second creepy thing, they were definitely being lost. Only if they were caught though. That thought came seconds too late as Gendry rushed forwards, accidentally knocking Hot Pie over, poor kid had terrible balance. Hot Pie of course, couldn\u2019t handle it gracefully, instead crashing into the wall and making an echoey sound. Silence came from behind the door, and then it was opened.</p><p>There was the girl\u2019s friend who had opened the door, and Arya Stark on the bed, lying there. Gendry tried his best to play it off by leaping to his feet and smiling, waving. \u201cHi, we were just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEavesdropping.\u201d Arya\u2019s expression indicated she did not think it particularly funny.
