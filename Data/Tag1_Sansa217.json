A lot of jonerys/dany fans take it as arya being all chummy with dany.  But I take it as a misdirection from the show runners and a major plot point that they don't want spoilered where arya will be the stark sibling MOST against dany.

Luckily there is a kind stranger comforting her.</small></p><p><small><i>Ballet AU // Hurt &amp; Comfort</i></small></p></blockquote><p>Tears were rolling down her cheeks, but she ran and ran and ran until she had no breath left, until her feet were hurting, until her hair was a giant mess. She couldn\u2019t do it anymore. She lost it. Everything she had dreamed of, everything she had wanted, everything she had wished for. She had lost it all.</p><p>She fell down on a bench in the park and she buried her face in her hands. She had had it all. She could choose to travel anywhere, dance anywhere. She could be the big star of any ballet company she had ever dreamed of and heard about. But here she was, with a barely healed back, too afraid to make all those movements that had once came so naturally to her. </p><p>\u201cWhy&rsquo;s a pretty girl like you crying this much?\u201d A guy sat down next to her on the bench. His shirt was soaked and pearls of sweat covered his entire body. He was just as out of breath as she was, but he hadn\u2019t been running from something, from somewhere. He had just been running, because he enjoyed it, because he chose it. \u201cWe guys can be so heartless sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s not a guy\u2026\u201d Sansa looked up and let out a deep breath. \u201cThere are more than enough guys in the world to find another love when one is acting like a heartless monster.\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cIt would have been so much easier if it had been just a guy\u2026\u201d</p><p>The guy next to her kept silent for a moment. His dark curls were blown by the wind and he closed his eyes to protect them from the burning sunlight. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a guy, it must be pretty damn bad\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a very deep breath. \u201cIt&rsquo;s only my biggest dream and life being destroyed.\u201d She shrugged and leaned back.</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d The boy next to her turned his face towards her. There was no judgement in his eyes. He genuinely seemed to be interested in her answer.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll never be able to dance again. Not like I used to. Not professionally.\u201d Strangely enough it was like a weight was lifted from her chest when she said the words out loud. \u201cI won&rsquo;t become the prima ballerina I\u2019ve always wanted to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell her it wasn\u2019t as bad as she made it to be, he didn\u2019t tell her she was just being dramatic, he didn\u2019t tell her that life goes on. \u201cLet\u2019s go get coffee or ice cream or whatever you need and deserve right now.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips curled up into a smile. \u201cThat would be nice\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, Jon.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled back at her. \u201cWell, what will it be\u2026.?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSansa, Sansa Stark.\u201d</p><p>His smile brightened. \u201cWhat will it be, Sansa Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d Sansa nodded at him. \u201cI want and need all of it.\u201d</p>",

She certainly has potential, and she learns by experience, which should greatly aid her in the future, but it\u2019s not the same thing. And besides that\u2026 other than really basic connections (house arrest, escape during the death of a royal)\u2026 there\u2019s not much else. Sansa, besides not being part of the royal family (betrothed is not the same) has also suffered far more greatly in her imprisonment and current status than Alysanne did. (Visenya never treated her captives badly, whereas Sansa was beaten and abused etc.) Frankly IMO at this point Sansa bears a touch more resemblance to Alysanne\u2019s unfortunate older sister Rhaena (eldest daughter, betrothed/married the heir, forced marriage, hiding in disguise and all). But most importantly, a <i>huge</i> thing missing in any sense of parallels is the lack of a Svengali-like character in the Sons of the Dragon era \u2013 there\u2019s no Littlefinger-parallel, with an obsession with Queen Alyssa, who manipulates her daughter to his own ends.</p><p>Furthermore, I think it\u2019s ridiculous to assume that because of the small parallels that do exist that Sansa\u2019s future will thus follow Alysanne\u2019s entirely.

Further furthermore, *ship-snarking under the cut*</p><!-- more --><p>I find it fucking <i>hilarious</i> that this current promotion of Sansa=Alysanne comes from jonsas who want her to be Queen of Westeros to Jon\u2019s Jaehaerys-parallel \u2013 but at the same time:</p><ul><li>hate Targaryens and call them incestuous Aryan barbies who illegally enslaved Westeros</li><li>but Jon is Aegon Targaryen and thus Lawful Ruler of Westeros, that\u2019s fine</li><li>(related: dragons are bad! nuclear weapons! nuclear winter! gosh we can\u2019t wait for Jon to get the dragon he deserves far more than the bitch who was just <i>given</i> them)</li><li>also Jaehaerys and Alysanne were <i>great</i> Targaryens, so beloved, isn\u2019t it wonderful how Jon and Sansa are just like them!</li><li>incest is bad mmkay? ugh how could Jon fuck his aunt ugh he must be manipulating her in secret</li><li>but yeah incest is fine when they\u2019re <i>really</i> first cousins, that\u2019s not even incest at all actually \u2013 oh, Jaehaerys and Alysanne were brother and sister? oh <i>they</i> were fine, sure, and Jon and Sansa are brother and sister, look at that perfect parallel!</li></ul><p>it just makes me laugh and laugh and roll my eyes so hard at the incredible hypocrisy oh my god</p><p><i>Anyway</i>. Ship-shaming aside (and I throw it with great force), IMO <i>if</i> there is any Alysanne parallel that will be developed more strongly in Sansa\u2019s story\u2026 I think <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/125833139793/how-do-you-feel-about-the-aegon-and-sansa-endgame\">it\u2019s possible that she will encounter the actual Aegon Targaryen</a>\u2026 that is, <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/33407588005/yes-he-most-likely-is-and-it-might-or-it-might\">the <i>faked</i> Aegon Targaryen</a>, lol, and may be tempted to become his queen, to be a good queen like Alysanne. But I also think <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/147747695218/as-the-originator-of-the-ashford-tourney-theory\">something will happen to mess up that plan (just like how there was no winner or final QoLaB of the Ashford Tourney)</a> \u2013 whether Sansa figuring out that there\u2019s something off about Aegon and the Golden Company, or <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/tagged/%E2%99%AB-they%27re-cousins-identical-cousins-%E2%99%AB\">someone else messing it up like Dunk messed up Ashford</a>, or who knows what. And if Sansa does want to be another Alysanne, she\u2019ll do it in the North \u2013 maybe starting by changing <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/180109590683/how-progressive-is-the-north-about-gender-roles\">their resistance to ruling ladies</a>, whether as <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/31941538821/timeturner-but-surely-if-sansa-were-to-be-queen\">a regent for her younger brother</a> or <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/37311254441/currently-i-think-sansa-has-one-of-the-better-if\">ruler in name as well as deed</a> \u2013 like Alysanne\u2019s Laws improved the rights of women throughout Westeros. And everything else she may do thereafter.</p><p>Or, more likely, if there is any potential Jaehaerys and Alysanne parallels in Westeros <i>as rulers</i> (that is, not parallel in backstory, but in how they act as rulers and change Westeros for the better), it will be Jon and <i>Dany</i>. If they survive the War for the Dawn, <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/103936770738/seriously-screw-rhaegar-and-lyanna-come-again\">that is my greatest wish for them, with Tyrion as their Septon Barth-parallel Hand</a>.</p><p>I hope that helps!</p>",

Currently really into the Sansan fandom, but I'll probably cross over into other fandoms as well, given time. Just for refrence, I'm 27 so I'd prefer only people who are 18+ to interact with my blog, since my fics and some other stuff I post could be explicit/inappropriate/NSFW.",
