One moment King Robert is a laughing, roaring mountain of flesh, and the next his heart gives out and all that flesh had gone slack. All the court but for his lady wife mourns him. If Cersei feels any sorrow in her lord husband\u2019s passing it never reaches her face, but Jon cannot bring himself to blame her for it. He has never forgotten what Robert let happen on the Kingsroad and Jon has been too many years at court to think the fat man any but a poor sort of king. Still a chill shivers through him when he hears the news.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll dismiss you as Hand,\u201d Jon says without preamble when he finds his father in the tower of the Hand. \u201cThe moment he\u2019s crowned Joffrey will send us back north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is his right.\u201d Ned says wearily, the chain of interlocking hands hanging from his neck clinking softly. His few years in King\u2019s Landing have aged him more than all those in Winterfell, beard streaked with grey. \u201cThe king chooses the hand.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, Jon thought his father would resist the loss of Handship. It makes him pause. \u201cYou won\u2019t fight it?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Ned shakes his head. \u201cJoffrey is our rightful king now, no matter what we think of him, Jon. And truth be told I am tired unto death of being Hand. I would see Winterfell again.\u201d</p><p><i>Winterfell.</i> For a moment it is all Jon can think of: the scent of weirwood and pine, the crunch of snow beneath feet and cold wind on his skin, the warmth of Winterfell\u2019s hearth and the sight of Robb and Bran and Rickon striding forward to greet him. But he knows too what returning north would mean, and before his eyes flits again the sharp, fragile line of Sansa\u2019s clenched jaw, the way her fingers had fisted in his sleeve on her wedding night. \u201cArya and Sansa cannot come with us. One is betrothed and the other married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are good matches. Sansa will be queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Joffrey.\u201d The name is sour on Jon\u2019s tongue. \u201cYou know what he is, father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is the rightful heir,\u201d Ned says sharply, and Jon frowns at the sudden change in his voice. \u201cAnd it is too late to change that, not without seeing the realm bleed. No, when his grace Joffrey demands it we will go north again and Arya and Sansa will stay in Kingslanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me stay too.\u201d And suddenly Jon knows what he must do, the answer to why Ned brought him south with him all those years ago even if his father had not known it then. \u201cName me a knight of the Kingsguard. Bastards have served before, and you have the power as Hand. No one will question your right to name a brother of the queen\u2019s own blood.\u201d</p><p>Ned frowns. \u201cIt is no small thing to become a knight of the kingsguard, Jon. Till death you will serve, and for whoever holds the Iron Throne, no matter how little you may love him. It is not a decision to be made lightly or on a whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept me from taking the oath of the Night\u2019s Watch once, but for what?\u201d Jon draws himself up. \u201cI will never inherit lands or hold titles. Not in the north, and not here. But there is honor in serving in the Kingsguard, even for a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven for a bastard.\u201d Ned studies his face. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p><i>Till death you will serve.</i> But Jon knows the answer, has always known it.<i> I will never be a Stark but I can still do the duty of one, father.</i> He nods, once and sharp. \u201cYou must do it now, before he is crowned, while you still hold the power of Hand. Joffrey will never name me himself.\u201d</p><p>Ned nods, something tired in his eyes. \u201cI will speak to Selmy.\u201d</p><hr><p>Tyrion answers his door with a scowl, rubbing sleep from his eyes with the heel of his palm. He blinks when he sees Jon standing in the dark of the hallway outside his chamber. \u201cSnow? I must admit if this is a dream I\u2019d prefer if you were rather more woman and rather less dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour whores.\u201d The word grates Jon\u2019s tongue, but it is the one that fits. <i>There is no hiding your shame with pretty words, Snow.</i> Half a hundred times he\u2019d tossed and turned in his bed unable to find sleep, a shameful and restless energy grating his nerves until he\u2019d thrown himself to his feet and dressed in the dark. Tall and forbidding the walls of the Red Keep had stared down as he slipped from his chamber, like he was a thief caught stealing through them. \u201cWhere do you find them?\u201d</p><p>The little man shrugs. \u201cHere and there. When you\u2019re a lord\u2019s son, even one grotesque as I, they find you.\u201d His mismatched eyes peer at Jon, a shrewd look in them. \u201cWhy trouble yourself with it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Tyrion is no more friend to Joffrey than Jon. The knowledge of his knighting is safe with him, but still Jon hesitates. <i>This is the path you\u2019ve chosen.</i> \u201cTomorrow I join the kingsguard.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion studies Jon\u2019s face with his mismatched eyes, then abruptly grins. \u201cWell Snow, it seems I must introduce you to Chataya then.\u201d</p><p>It is not so late that Kingslanding is yet sleeping. Lanterns seethe like embers under the skin of the city as Jon and Tyrion ride through winding streets that lead them to an elegant two storied house. Its windows shine a deep purple and blue and crimson like a many faceted jewel peeking out from among the drab walls of the behind it. Its door is inlaid with writhing vines of bronze that flash in the lantern light as a tall woman with skin black as teak opens it before them. \u201cLord of Lannister,\u201d she says to Tyrion with a bow of her head. \u201cAnd your squire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Tyrion claps a hand on Jon\u2019s back, \u201cthis is Lord Snow, soon to be Ser Snow of the kingsguard. I\u2019ve brought him to taste what he\u2019ll be forswearing for a white cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA noble cause.\u201d If the knowledge surprises the woman she does not show it. She raises a hand to invite them inside, and Jon follows Tyrion into a common room lit by bronze lamps twisted and teased into ornate shapes. In their flicking light are scattered a half dozen girls more lovely than any Jon has ever seen, slender and curved forms reclining in cushioned alcoves. A knife of shame stabs Jon\u2019s gut at the way lust rises in him like an ocean swell, and he jerks his gaze away.</p><p>\u201cMarei will be ready for you shortly, my lord,\u201d the tall woman says to Tyrion. She pours wine into a pair of copper goblets and passes them to Tyrion and Jon as she nods her head to one of the girls half hidden behind a Myrish screen. \u201cMight I suggest Dancy for Lord Snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does have a wicked tongue,\u201d Tyrion muses aloud, mismatched eyes sliding to Jon beside him. Jon flushes. The girl is beautiful, freckled and lushly curved, with long red hair brushed to a copper sheen that reaches to her hip. As if she can feel his eyes on her the girl glances up at him, a slow, wicked smile turning the corners of her lips. There is nothing of her but for the red of her hair that is like Sansa, yet her smile coils something sick in Jon\u2019s gut, and for a moment he can again feel Sansa\u2019s fingers tangling in his sleeve, the fragile weight of her in his arms, the way her eyes had pled with him.</p><p>Jon wrenches his gaze away. <i>I am no Joffrey.</i> He downs the goblet in a single swallow, tongue barely recognizing the smooth ripple that marks it as Arbor Gold. \u201cNot her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlayaya then?\u201d The tall woman beckons forward a girl teak black and near as tall as herself. The girl rises gracefully and crosses to them, dark eyes regarding Jon calmly for a moment before bending and kissing Tyrion on the cheek. \u201cThank you again for the history you lent me, Lord Tyrion. A strange line the Durrandon kings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they not?\u201d Tywin smiles crookedly at her. \u201cBut for now your thought should be to Lord Snow here. He\u2019s come to make himself a man.\u201d</p><p>The young woman meets Jon\u2019s eyes. She takes his cup and gently pulls him towards a stair off the common room. \u201cCome my lord, I will refill your cup.\u201d</p><p>Jon lets himself be pulled away, the Arbor Gold warm in his chest as Alayaya leads him up the stairs and to a modest room with a silk veiled bed and a mural on the wall of a pair of women caught in the throes of release. Her fingers slip from his palm as she moves to the sideboard and refills his cup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no lord,\u201d Jon says abruptly. He meets Alayaya\u2019s gaze as she finishes refilling his cup. \u201cThat\u2019s only Tyrion\u2019s jape. I\u2019m bastard born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am bastard too counted your Westorosi way.\u201d Alayaya tilts her head to the side as she returns to where he stands. She hands him his cup. \u201cMy father was a summer islander like my mother, a sailor passing through Kingslanding on his way to Braavos. But among my people there is no shame in bastard birth, for the gods made not only us but our desires too, and in that way we bastards are a gift of the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt a gift.\u201d Jon laughs, the sound more hollow than he expected, and takes a long swallow. A fine vintage, but just as before his tongue catches little of it. He looks up to find Alayaya stepping closer. He swallows, finds his tongue thick. \u201cI mean not to father a bastard tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I not to make one.\u201d Alayaya smiles faintly, soft and lovely, and splays a hand on his chest. Her height makes it so all she must do is tilt her head to the side and then her lips are parting his, splayed fingers tangling in his shirt as she draws him beneath the canopy of the bed.</p><p>Jon does not last long. Alayaya stretches beside him after, lithe and dark in the lantern light as she traces faint circles across his chest and stomach, fingertips a whisper. And when those fingertips have again begun to coil a heat she slides down and takes him into her mouth, makes him as achingly hard as though he\u2019d never spent his seed.</p><p>The second time Jon lasts longer. She sways above him, lantern light flickering along the curves of her arms and throat and dark tips of her breasts, hips grinding slow circles against him. She leans over him, arches against him, skin fever-hot, and then he can hold the growing pressure in him no longer. Alayaya seems to know without words, teeth nipping the hollow of his collarbone as she reaches down and pulls him from her, fingers milking his length as he spends into her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou may stay, my lord,\u201d she tells him after, as he gathers his breeches and shirt. She rolls onto her stomach, dark eyes shining up at him. \u201cWe will speak or sleep and perhaps after a time lie together again.\u201d</p><p>Jon shakes his head. Shame he expects the stab of, but instead all he feels is a marrow-deep calm. <i>This is the path you\u2019ve chosen. This is what you will forsake. </i>He pulls his shirt over his head. \u201cTomorrow I am knighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSer Snow,\u201d Alayaya sing-songs, tilting her head. \u201cA good name. Come back to us when you have it and I or Dancy or Marei will moan it in your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow too I take the oath of the kingsguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Alayaya rolls to her side, stretches like some great languid cat, the curves of her sweet against the mattress in a way that even though he is twice spent makes Jon&rsquo;s groin ache. \u201cCome all the same. You will not be the first of your white brothers to visit our house.\u201d</p><p><i>All men are weak.</i> Even his father had succumb to temptation once, but what worth is a knight who cannot keep his vows? For some reason again Sansa\u2019s face floats before his eyes, and Jon shakes his head. \u201cI mean to keep my vows. But\u2026 thank you. For this.\u201d</p><p>Alayaya accepts with a dip of her head and a faint smile. \u201cFare well, ser knight.\u201d</p><hr><p>AN:\u00a0Just as a heads up, though she is one of my favorite side characters, this isn\u2019t going to be a Jon/Alayaya fic.</p>",

Still a chill shivers through him when he hears the news.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll dismiss you as Hand,\u201d Jon says without preamble when he finds his father in the tower of the Hand. \u201cThe moment he\u2019s crowned Joffrey will send us back north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is his right.\u201d Ned says wearily, the chain of interlocking hands hanging from his neck clinking softly. His few years in King\u2019s Landing have aged him more than all those in Winterfell, beard streaked with grey. \u201cThe king chooses the hand.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, Jon thought his father would resist the loss of Handship. It makes him pause. \u201cYou won\u2019t fight it?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Ned shakes his head. \u201cJoffrey is our rightful king now, no matter what we think of him, Jon. And truth be told I am tired unto death of being Hand. I would see Winterfell again.\u201d</p><p><i>Winterfell.</i> For a moment it is all Jon can think of: the scent of weirwood and pine, the crunch of snow beneath feet and cold wind on his skin, the warmth of Winterfell\u2019s hearth and the sight of Robb and Bran and Rickon striding forward to greet him. But he knows too what returning north would mean, and before his eyes flits again the sharp, fragile line of Sansa\u2019s clenched jaw, the way her fingers had fisted in his sleeve on her wedding night. \u201cArya and Sansa cannot come with us. One is betrothed and the other married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are good matches. Sansa will be queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Joffrey.\u201d The name is sour on Jon\u2019s tongue. \u201cYou know what he is, father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is the rightful heir,\u201d Ned says sharply, and Jon frowns at the sudden change in his voice. \u201cAnd it is too late to change that, not without seeing the realm bleed. No, when his grace Joffrey demands it we will go north again and Arya and Sansa will stay in Kingslanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me stay too.\u201d And suddenly Jon knows what he must do, the answer to why Ned brought him south with him all those years ago even if his father had not known it then. \u201cName me a knight of the Kingsguard. Bastards have served before, and you have the power as Hand. No one will question your right to name a brother of the queen\u2019s own blood.\u201d</p><p>Ned frowns. \u201cIt is no small thing to become a knight of the kingsguard, Jon. Till death you will serve, and for whoever holds the Iron Throne, no matter how little you may love him. It is not a decision to be made lightly or on a whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept me from taking the oath of the Night\u2019s Watch once, but for what?\u201d Jon draws himself up. \u201cI will never inherit lands or hold titles. Not in the north, and not here. But there is honor in serving in the Kingsguard, even for a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven for a bastard.\u201d Ned studies his face. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p><i>Till death you will serve.</i> But Jon knows the answer, has always known it.<i> I will never be a Stark but I can still do the duty of one, father.</i> He nods, once and sharp. \u201cYou must do it now, before he is crowned, while you still hold the power of Hand. Joffrey will never name me himself.\u201d</p><p>Ned nods, something tired in his eyes. \u201cI will speak to Selmy.\u201d</p><hr><p>Tyrion answers his door with a scowl, rubbing sleep from his eyes with the heel of his palm. He blinks when he sees Jon standing in the dark of the hallway outside his chamber. \u201cSnow? I must admit if this is a dream I\u2019d prefer if you were rather more woman and rather less dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour whores.\u201d The word grates Jon\u2019s tongue, but it is the one that fits. <i>There is no hiding your shame with pretty words, Snow.</i> Half a hundred times he\u2019d tossed and turned in his bed unable to find sleep, a shameful and restless energy grating his nerves until he\u2019d thrown himself to his feet and dressed in the dark. Tall and forbidding the walls of the Red Keep had stared down as he slipped from his chamber, like he was a thief caught stealing through them. \u201cWhere do you find them?\u201d</p><p>The little man shrugs. \u201cHere and there. When you\u2019re a lord\u2019s son, even one grotesque as I, they find you.\u201d His mismatched eyes peer at Jon, a shrewd look in them. \u201cWhy trouble yourself with it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Tyrion is no more friend to Joffrey than Jon. The knowledge of his knighting is safe with him, but still Jon hesitates. <i>This is the path you\u2019ve chosen.</i> \u201cTomorrow I join the kingsguard.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion studies Jon\u2019s face with his mismatched eyes, then abruptly grins. \u201cWell Snow, it seems I must introduce you to Chataya then.\u201d</p><p>It is not so late that Kingslanding is yet sleeping. Lanterns seethe like embers under the skin of the city as Jon and Tyrion ride through winding streets that lead them to an elegant two storied house. Its windows shine a deep purple and blue and crimson like a many faceted jewel peeking out from among the drab walls of the behind it. Its door is inlaid with writhing vines of bronze that flash in the lantern light as a tall woman with skin black as teak opens it before them. \u201cLord of Lannister,\u201d she says to Tyrion with a bow of her head. \u201cAnd your squire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Tyrion claps a hand on Jon\u2019s back, \u201cthis is Lord Snow, soon to be Ser Snow of the kingsguard. I\u2019ve brought him to taste what he\u2019ll be forswearing for a white cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA noble cause.\u201d If the knowledge surprises the woman she does not show it. She raises a hand to invite them inside, and Jon follows Tyrion into a common room lit by bronze lamps twisted and teased into ornate shapes. In their flicking light are scattered a half dozen girls more lovely than any Jon has ever seen, slender and curved forms reclining in cushioned alcoves. A knife of shame stabs Jon\u2019s gut at the way lust rises in him like an ocean swell, and he jerks his gaze away.</p><p>\u201cMarei will be ready for you shortly, my lord,\u201d the tall woman says to Tyrion. She pours wine into a pair of copper goblets and passes them to Tyrion and Jon as she nods her head to one of the girls half hidden behind a Myrish screen. \u201cMight I suggest Dancy for Lord Snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does have a wicked tongue,\u201d Tyrion muses aloud, mismatched eyes sliding to Jon beside him. Jon flushes. The girl is beautiful, freckled and lushly curved, with long red hair brushed to a copper sheen that reaches to her hip. As if she can feel his eyes on her the girl glances up at him, a slow, wicked smile turning the corners of her lips. There is nothing of her but for the red of her hair that is like Sansa, yet her smile coils something sick in Jon\u2019s gut, and for a moment he can again feel Sansa\u2019s fingers tangling in his sleeve, the fragile weight of her in his arms, the way her eyes had pled with him.</p><p>Jon wrenches his gaze away. <i>I am no Joffrey.</i> He downs the goblet in a single swallow, tongue barely recognizing the smooth ripple that marks it as Arbor Gold. \u201cNot her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlayaya then?\u201d The tall woman beckons forward a girl teak black and near as tall as herself. The girl rises gracefully and crosses to them, dark eyes regarding Jon calmly for a moment before bending and kissing Tyrion on the cheek. \u201cThank you again for the history you lent me, Lord Tyrion. A strange line the Durrandon kings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they not?\u201d Tywin smiles crookedly at her. \u201cBut for now your thought should be to Lord Snow here. He\u2019s come to make himself a man.\u201d</p><p>The young woman meets Jon\u2019s eyes. She takes his cup and gently pulls him towards a stair off the common room. \u201cCome my lord, I will refill your cup.\u201d</p><p>Jon lets himself be pulled away, the Arbor Gold warm in his chest as Alayaya leads him up the stairs and to a modest room with a silk veiled bed and a mural on the wall of a pair of women caught in the throes of release. Her fingers slip from his palm as she moves to the sideboard and refills his cup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no lord,\u201d Jon says abruptly. He meets Alayaya\u2019s gaze as she finishes refilling his cup. \u201cThat\u2019s only Tyrion\u2019s jape. I\u2019m bastard born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am bastard too counted your Westorosi way.\u201d Alayaya tilts her head to the side as she returns to where he stands. She hands him his cup. \u201cMy father was a summer islander like my mother, a sailor passing through Kingslanding on his way to Braavos. But among my people there is no shame in bastard birth, for the gods made not only us but our desires too, and in that way we bastards are a gift of the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt a gift.\u201d Jon laughs, the sound more hollow than he expected, and takes a long swallow. A fine vintage, but just as before his tongue catches little of it. He looks up to find Alayaya stepping closer. He swallows, finds his tongue thick. \u201cI mean not to father a bastard tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I not to make one.\u201d Alayaya smiles faintly, soft and lovely, and splays a hand on his chest. Her height makes it so all she must do is tilt her head to the side and then her lips are parting his, splayed fingers tangling in his shirt as she draws him beneath the canopy of the bed.</p><p>Jon does not last long. Alayaya stretches beside him after, lithe and dark in the lantern light as she traces faint circles across his chest and stomach, fingertips a whisper. And when those fingertips have again begun to coil a heat she slides down and takes him into her mouth, makes him as achingly hard as though he\u2019d never spent his seed.</p><p>The second time Jon lasts longer. She sways above him, lantern light flickering along the curves of her arms and throat and dark tips of her breasts, hips grinding slow circles against him. She leans over him, arches against him, skin fever-hot, and then he can hold the growing pressure in him no longer. Alayaya seems to know without words, teeth nipping the hollow of his collarbone as she reaches down and pulls him from her, fingers milking his length as he spends into her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou may stay, my lord,\u201d she tells him after, as he gathers his breeches and shirt. She rolls onto her stomach, dark eyes shining up at him. \u201cWe will speak or sleep and perhaps after a time lie together again.\u201d</p><p>Jon shakes his head. Shame he expects the stab of, but instead all he feels is a marrow-deep calm. <i>This is the path you\u2019ve chosen. This is what you will forsake. </i>He pulls his shirt over his head. \u201cTomorrow I am knighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSer Snow,\u201d Alayaya sing-songs, tilting her head. \u201cA good name. Come back to us when you have it and I or Dancy or Marei will moan it in your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow too I take the oath of the kingsguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Alayaya rolls to her side, stretches like some great languid cat, the curves of her sweet against the mattress in a way that even though he is twice spent makes Jon\u2019s groin ache. \u201cCome all the same. You will not be the first of your white brothers to visit our house.\u201d</p><p><i>All men are weak.</i> Even his father had succumb to temptation once, but what worth is a knight who cannot keep his vows? For some reason again Sansa\u2019s face floats before his eyes, and Jon shakes his head. \u201cI mean to keep my vows. But\u2026 thank you. For this.\u201d</p><p>Alayaya accepts with a dip of her head and a faint smile. \u201cFare well, ser knight.\u201d</p><hr><p>AN:\u00a0Just as a heads up, though she is one of my favorite side characters, this isn\u2019t going to be a Jon/Alayaya fic.</p>",

One moment King Robert is a laughing, roaring mountain of flesh, and the next his heart gives out and all that flesh had gone slack. All the court but for his lady wife mourns him.

But he knows too what returning north would mean, and before his eyes flits again the sharp, fragile line of Sansa\u2019s clenched jaw, the way her fingers had fisted in his sleeve on her wedding night. \u201cArya and Sansa cannot come with us.

No, when his grace Joffrey demands it we will go north again and Arya and Sansa will stay in Kingslanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me stay too.\u201d And suddenly Jon knows what he must do, the answer to why Ned brought him south with him all those years ago even if his father had not known it then. \u201cName me a knight of the Kingsguard. Bastards have served before, and you have the power as Hand. No one will question your right to name a brother of the queen\u2019s own blood.\u201d</p><p>Ned frowns. \u201cIt is no small thing to become a knight of the kingsguard, Jon.

It is not a decision to be made lightly or on a whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept me from taking the oath of the Night\u2019s Watch once, but for what?\u201d Jon draws himself up. \u201cI will never inherit lands or hold titles. Not in the north, and not here. But there is honor in serving in the Kingsguard, even for a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven for a bastard.\u201d Ned studies his face. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p><i>Till death you will serve.</i> But Jon knows the answer, has always known it.<i> I will never be a Stark but I can still do the duty of one, father.</i> He nods, once and sharp. \u201cYou must do it now, before he is crowned, while you still hold the power of Hand. Joffrey will never name me himself.\u201d</p><p>Ned nods, something tired in his eyes. \u201cI will speak to Selmy.\u201d</p><hr><p>Tyrion answers his door with a scowl, rubbing sleep from his eyes with the heel of his palm. He blinks when he sees Jon standing in the dark of the hallway outside his chamber. \u201cSnow? I must admit if this is a dream I\u2019d prefer if you were rather more woman and rather less dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour whores.\u201d The word grates Jon\u2019s tongue, but it is the one that fits. <i>There is no hiding your shame with pretty words, Snow.</i> Half a hundred times he\u2019d tossed and turned in his bed unable to find sleep, a shameful and restless energy grating his nerves until he\u2019d thrown himself to his feet and dressed in the dark. Tall and forbidding the walls of the Red Keep had stared down as he slipped from his chamber, like he was a thief caught stealing through them. \u201cWhere do you find them?\u201d</p><p>The little man shrugs. \u201cHere and there.

The knowledge of his knighting is safe with him, but still Jon hesitates. <i>This is the path you\u2019ve chosen.</i> \u201cTomorrow I join the kingsguard.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion studies Jon\u2019s face with his mismatched eyes, then abruptly grins. \u201cWell Snow, it seems I must introduce you to Chataya then.\u201d</p><p>It is not so late that Kingslanding is yet sleeping. Lanterns seethe like embers under the skin of the city as Jon and Tyrion ride through winding streets that lead them to an elegant two storied house. Its windows shine a deep purple and blue and crimson like a many faceted jewel peeking out from among the drab walls of the behind it. Its door is inlaid with writhing vines of bronze that flash in the lantern light as a tall woman with skin black as teak opens it before them. \u201cLord of Lannister,\u201d she says to Tyrion with a bow of her head. \u201cAnd your squire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Tyrion claps a hand on Jon\u2019s back, \u201cthis is Lord Snow, soon to be Ser Snow of the kingsguard. I\u2019ve brought him to taste what he\u2019ll be forswearing for a white cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA noble cause.\u201d If the knowledge surprises the woman she does not show it. She raises a hand to invite them inside, and Jon follows Tyrion into a common room lit by bronze lamps twisted and teased into ornate shapes. In their flicking light are scattered a half dozen girls more lovely than any Jon has ever seen, slender and curved forms reclining in cushioned alcoves. A knife of shame stabs Jon\u2019s gut at the way lust rises in him like an ocean swell, and he jerks his gaze away.</p><p>\u201cMarei will be ready for you shortly, my lord,\u201d the tall woman says to Tyrion. She pours wine into a pair of copper goblets and passes them to Tyrion and Jon as she nods her head to one of the girls half hidden behind a Myrish screen. \u201cMight I suggest Dancy for Lord Snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does have a wicked tongue,\u201d Tyrion muses aloud, mismatched eyes sliding to Jon beside him. Jon flushes. The girl is beautiful, freckled and lushly curved, with long red hair brushed to a copper sheen that reaches to her hip. As if she can feel his eyes on her the girl glances up at him, a slow, wicked smile turning the corners of her lips. There is nothing of her but for the red of her hair that is like Sansa, yet her smile coils something sick in Jon\u2019s gut, and for a moment he can again feel Sansa\u2019s fingers tangling in his sleeve, the fragile weight of her in his arms, the way her eyes had pled with him.</p><p>Jon wrenches his gaze away. <i>I am no Joffrey.</i> He downs the goblet in a single swallow, tongue barely recognizing the smooth ripple that marks it as Arbor Gold. \u201cNot her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlayaya then?\u201d The tall woman beckons forward a girl teak black and near as tall as herself. The girl rises gracefully and crosses to them, dark eyes regarding Jon calmly for a moment before bending and kissing Tyrion on the cheek. \u201cThank you again for the history you lent me, Lord Tyrion. A strange line the Durrandon kings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they not?\u201d Tywin smiles crookedly at her. \u201cBut for now your thought should be to Lord Snow here. He\u2019s come to make himself a man.\u201d</p><p>The young woman meets Jon\u2019s eyes. She takes his cup and gently pulls him towards a stair off the common room. \u201cCome my lord, I will refill your cup.\u201d</p><p>Jon lets himself be pulled away, the Arbor Gold warm in his chest as Alayaya leads him up the stairs and to a modest room with a silk veiled bed and a mural on the wall of a pair of women caught in the throes of release. Her fingers slip from his palm as she moves to the sideboard and refills his cup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no lord,\u201d Jon says abruptly. He meets Alayaya\u2019s gaze as she finishes refilling his cup. \u201cThat\u2019s only Tyrion\u2019s jape. I\u2019m bastard born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am bastard too counted your Westorosi way.\u201d Alayaya tilts her head to the side as she returns to where he stands. She hands him his cup. \u201cMy father was a summer islander like my mother, a sailor passing through Kingslanding on his way to Braavos. But among my people there is no shame in bastard birth, for the gods made not only us but our desires too, and in that way we bastards are a gift of the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt a gift.\u201d Jon laughs, the sound more hollow than he expected, and takes a long swallow. A fine vintage, but just as before his tongue catches little of it. He looks up to find Alayaya stepping closer. He swallows, finds his tongue thick. \u201cI mean not to father a bastard tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I not to make one.\u201d Alayaya smiles faintly, soft and lovely, and splays a hand on his chest.

                "content": "<p>Jon x Sansa<i> - AU where Jon goes to Kingslanding instead of the Wall, there&rsquo;s no war, and he becomes a knight of the kingsguard even as Joffrey marries Sansa</i><b> </b>/ <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17942843/chapters/42756056\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a><br /></p><p><b></b></p><p>It happens suddenly. One moment King Robert is a laughing, roaring mountain of flesh, and the next his heart gives out and all that flesh had gone slack. All the court but for his lady wife mourns him. If Cersei feels any sorrow in her lord husband&rsquo;s passing it never reaches her face, but Jon cannot bring himself to blame her for it. He has never forgotten what Robert let happen on the Kingsroad and Jon has been too many years at court to think the fat man any but a poor sort of king. Still a chill shivers through him when he hears the news.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll dismiss you as Hand,&rdquo; Jon says without preamble when he finds his father in the tower of the Hand. &ldquo;The moment he&rsquo;s crowned Joffrey will send us back north.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is his right.&rdquo; Ned says wearily, the chain of interlocking hands hanging from his neck clinking softly. His few years in King&rsquo;s Landing have aged him more than all those in Winterfell, beard streaked with grey. &ldquo;The king chooses the hand.&rdquo;</p><p>Somehow, Jon thought his father would resist the loss of Handship. It makes him pause. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t fight it?&rdquo;</p><p>Ned shakes his head. &ldquo;Joffrey is our rightful king now, no matter what we think of him, Jon. And truth be told I am tired unto death of being Hand. I would see Winterfell again.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Winterfell.</i> For a moment it is all Jon can think of: the scent of weirwood and pine, the crunch of snow beneath feet and cold wind on his skin, the warmth of Winterfell&rsquo;s hearth and the sight of Robb and Bran and Rickon striding forward to greet him. But he knows too what returning north would mean, and before his eyes flits again the sharp, fragile line of Sansa&rsquo;s clenched jaw, the way her fingers had fisted in his sleeve on her wedding night. &ldquo;Arya and Sansa cannot come with us. One is betrothed and the other married.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are good matches. Sansa will be queen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To Joffrey.&rdquo; The name is sour on Jon&rsquo;s tongue. &ldquo;You know what he is, father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is the rightful heir,&rdquo; Ned says sharply, and Jon frowns at the sudden change in his voice. &ldquo;And it is too late to change that, not without seeing the realm bleed. No, when his grace Joffrey demands it we will go north again and Arya and Sansa will stay in Kingslanding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me stay too.&rdquo; And suddenly Jon knows what he must do, the answer to why Ned brought him south with him all those years ago even if his father had not known it then. &ldquo;Name me a knight of the Kingsguard. Bastards have served before, and you have the power as Hand. No one will question your right to name a brother of the queen&rsquo;s own blood.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned frowns. &ldquo;It is no small thing to become a knight of the kingsguard, Jon. Till death you will serve, and for whoever holds the Iron Throne, no matter how little you may love him. It is not a decision to be made lightly or on a whim.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You kept me from taking the oath of the Night&rsquo;s Watch once, but for what?&rdquo; Jon draws himself up. &ldquo;I will never inherit lands or hold titles. Not in the north, and not here. But there is honor in serving in the Kingsguard, even for a bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even for a bastard.&rdquo; Ned studies his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Till death you will serve.</i> But Jon knows the answer, has always known it.<i> I will never be a Stark but I can still do the duty of one, father.</i> He nods, once and sharp. &ldquo;You must do it now, before he is crowned, while you still hold the power of Hand. Joffrey will never name me himself.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned nods, something tired in his eyes. &ldquo;I will speak to Selmy.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Tyrion answers his door with a scowl, rubbing sleep from his eyes with the heel of his palm. He blinks when he sees Jon standing in the dark of the hallway outside his chamber. &ldquo;Snow? I must admit if this is a dream I&rsquo;d prefer if you were rather more woman and rather less dressed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your whores.&rdquo; The word grates Jon&rsquo;s tongue, but it is the one that fits. <i>There is no hiding your shame with pretty words, Snow.</i> Half a hundred times he&rsquo;d tossed and turned in his bed unable to find sleep, a shameful and restless energy grating his nerves until he&rsquo;d thrown himself to his feet and dressed in the dark. Tall and forbidding the walls of the Red Keep had stared down as he slipped from his chamber, like he was a thief caught stealing through them. &ldquo;Where do you find them?&rdquo;</p><p>The little man shrugs. &ldquo;Here and there. When you&rsquo;re a lord&rsquo;s son, even one grotesque as I, they find you.&rdquo; His mismatched eyes peer at Jon, a shrewd look in them. &ldquo;Why trouble yourself with it now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-&rdquo; Tyrion is no more friend to Joffrey than Jon. The knowledge of his knighting is safe with him, but still Jon hesitates. <i>This is the path you&rsquo;ve chosen.</i> &ldquo;Tomorrow I join the kingsguard.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion studies Jon&rsquo;s face with his mismatched eyes, then abruptly grins. &ldquo;Well Snow, it seems I must introduce you to Chataya then.&rdquo;</p><p>It is not so late that Kingslanding is yet sleeping. Lanterns seethe like embers under the skin of the city as Jon and Tyrion ride through winding streets that lead them to an elegant two storied house. Its windows shine a deep purple and blue and crimson like a many faceted jewel peeking out from among the drab walls of the behind it. Its door is inlaid with writhing vines of bronze that flash in the lantern light as a tall woman with skin black as teak opens it before them. &ldquo;Lord of Lannister,&rdquo; she says to Tyrion with a bow of her head. &ldquo;And your squire?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Tyrion claps a hand on Jon&rsquo;s back, &ldquo;this is Lord Snow, soon to be Ser Snow of the kingsguard. I&rsquo;ve brought him to taste what he&rsquo;ll be forswearing for a white cloak.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A noble cause.&rdquo; If the knowledge surprises the woman she does not show it. She raises a hand to invite them inside, and Jon follows Tyrion into a common room lit by bronze lamps twisted and teased into ornate shapes. In their flicking light are scattered a half dozen girls more lovely than any Jon has ever seen, slender and curved forms reclining in cushioned alcoves. A knife of shame stabs Jon&rsquo;s gut at the way lust rises in him like an ocean swell, and he jerks his gaze away.</p><p>&ldquo;Marei will be ready for you shortly, my lord,&rdquo; the tall woman says to Tyrion. She pours wine into a pair of copper goblets and passes them to Tyrion and Jon as she nods her head to one of the girls half hidden behind a Myrish screen. &ldquo;Might I suggest Dancy for Lord Snow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She does have a wicked tongue,&rdquo; Tyrion muses aloud, mismatched eyes sliding to Jon beside him. Jon flushes. The girl is beautiful, freckled and lushly curved, with long red hair brushed to a copper sheen that reaches to her hip. As if she can feel his eyes on her the girl glances up at him, a slow, wicked smile turning the corners of her lips. There is nothing of her but for the red of her hair that is like Sansa, yet her smile coils something sick in Jon&rsquo;s gut, and for a moment he can again feel Sansa&rsquo;s fingers tangling in his sleeve, the fragile weight of her in his arms, the way her eyes had pled with him.</p><p>Jon wrenches his gaze away. <i>I am no Joffrey.</i> He downs the goblet in a single swallow, tongue barely recognizing the smooth ripple that marks it as Arbor Gold. &ldquo;Not her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alayaya then?&rdquo; The tall woman beckons forward a girl teak black and near as tall as herself. The girl rises gracefully and crosses to them, dark eyes regarding Jon calmly for a moment before bending and kissing Tyrion on the cheek. &ldquo;Thank you again for the history you lent me, Lord Tyrion. A strange line the Durrandon kings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are they not?&rdquo; Tywin smiles crookedly at her. &ldquo;But for now your thought should be to Lord Snow here. He&rsquo;s come to make himself a man.&rdquo;</p><p>The young woman meets Jon&rsquo;s eyes. She takes his cup and gently pulls him towards a stair off the common room. &ldquo;Come my lord, I will refill your cup.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon lets himself be pulled away, the Arbor Gold warm in his chest as Alayaya leads him up the stairs and to a modest room with a silk veiled bed and a mural on the wall of a pair of women caught in the throes of release. Her fingers slip from his palm as she moves to the sideboard and refills his cup.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no lord,&rdquo; Jon says abruptly. He meets Alayaya&rsquo;s gaze as she finishes refilling his cup. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only Tyrion&rsquo;s jape. I&rsquo;m bastard born.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am bastard too counted your Westorosi way.&rdquo; Alayaya tilts her head to the side as she returns to where he stands. She hands him his cup. &ldquo;My father was a summer islander like my mother, a sailor passing through Kingslanding on his way to Braavos. But among my people there is no shame in bastard birth, for the gods made not only us but our desires too, and in that way we bastards are a gift of the gods.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt a gift.&rdquo; Jon laughs, the sound more hollow than he expected, and takes a long swallow. A fine vintage, but just as before his tongue catches little of it. He looks up to find Alayaya stepping closer. He swallows, finds his tongue thick. &ldquo;I mean not to father a bastard tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I not to make one.&rdquo; Alayaya smiles faintly, soft and lovely, and splays a hand on his chest. Her height makes it so all she must do is tilt her head to the side and then her lips are parting his, splayed fingers tangling in his shirt as she draws him beneath the canopy of the bed.</p><p>Jon does not last long. Alayaya stretches beside him after, lithe and dark in the lantern light as she traces faint circles across his chest and stomach, fingertips a whisper. And when those fingertips have again begun to coil a heat she slides down and takes him into her mouth, makes him as achingly hard as though he&rsquo;d never spent his seed.</p><p>The second time Jon lasts longer.

Shame he expects the stab of, but instead all he feels is a marrow-deep calm. <i>This is the path you&rsquo;ve chosen.

Come back to us when you have it and I or Dancy or Marei will moan it in your ear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow too I take the oath of the kingsguard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; Alayaya rolls to her side, stretches like some great languid cat, the curves of her sweet against the mattress in a way that even though he is twice spent makes Jon&rsquo;s groin ache. &ldquo;Come all the same.

        "answer": "<p>I\u2019m going to level with you, I hate that argument. I find it baseless and deflecting, and it holds Ned to blame for the completely wrong things. </p><p>While Ned definitely has his own share of fuck ups and missteps in this situation, I do not consider not telling Catelyn the truth one of them. I\u2019m not sure why this theory that telling Catelyn about Jon\u2019s paternity would have fixed the state of affairs in Winterfell gained such traction in fandom when it clearly contradicts what we can infer of Catelyn\u2019s character motivation in her treatment of Jon. The general consensus on Cat\u2019s motives is that she acted out of anger and hurt at Ned\u2019s nominal infidelity, fear of the prospective danger Jon could pose to her children and resentment over her lack of control in a situation that she was forced to accept and had no say in. Of those, only Cat\u2019s negative feelings wrt Ned\u2019s nominal indiscretions would be assuage by the truth of Jon\u2019s paternity, though that would probably be replaced by anger and hurt over Ned\u2019s lies. But for someone whose main anxiety revolved around the prospective danger Jon could pose to her children, I don\u2019t see how knowing that Jon\u2019s identity could bring Robert\u2019s wrath on all of them would change Cat\u2019s fear for her children. Or how she, as a politically-minded person who already had the Blackfyres in mind and who bought into the prevalent societal stigmatization of bastards, would fail to see the possible parallels between Jon Snow and Daemon Blackfyre or grow concerned over what Jon\u2019s knowledge of his identity could mean for her family.</p><p>From where I\u2019m standing, <a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/156374388180/it-should-have-been-you\" target=\"_blank\">the truth exacerbates the prospective danger that Catelyn feared from Jon on a few levels</a>. Don\u2019t forget that Ned\u2019s decision to conceal and protect Jon, while morally above reproach, is still legally condemnable by the lights of their society and thus extremely dangerous to know, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Some+secrets+are+too+dangerous+to+share&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;povs%5B%5D=Eddard\" target=\"_blank\">something that Ned was very aware o</a>f. Bringing Catelyn in on the secret not only puts her in danger but also forces her to be complicit in what is essentially treason and compels her to be party to keeping a risky secret that she never signed up to keep. Meanwhile her concerns over Jon potentially trying to supplant her children still apply because he is still publicly recognized as Ned\u2019s son, and she can\u2019t very well tell anyone that he is not Ned\u2019s unless she wants to bring everything down on all of their heads. That situation would only augment Cat\u2019s lack of control and her resentment over it. It\u2019s also clear that Ned feared a situation where Cat would have to choose between Jon\u2019s life and her children\u2019s, which is not an unreasonable fear. Basically,<a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/180287170580/hi-sam-love-your-blog-xx-why-do-you-think-ned\" target=\"_blank\"> the truth puts Catelyn in a very bad position, endangers her and endangers Jon</a>, without offering any significant change to the state of affairs in Winterfell. Jon would remain the easiest target for Cat\u2019s resentment. She\u2019d still want to neutralize his double prospective danger as both a Targaryen descendant and Ned\u2019s publicly recognized son. She\u2019d still want a distance between him and her children. And I don\u2019t imagine she\u2019d be particularly enthused about Jon being in Winterfell when Robert comes. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t fault Ned for not telling Cat the truth.</p><p>What I <i>do</i> fault him for is his woeful mishandling of the situation. That the situation was inherently flawed was nobody\u2019s fault, but it is on Ned how he chose to deal with it, and he made a right mess. There is a lot of room between telling Catelyn the truth, and what he did in telling her (and Jon) absolutely nothing, which only served to make a crappy situation worse for everyone involved. Scaring Cat into silence by implementing his patriarchal power was objectively a dick move that amplified her lack of power. Ned\u2019s trauma, protectiveness of Jon, the fact that he is an uncomfortable liar and that this line of questioning hits all of this explain his actions but they don\u2019t make them acceptable. Ned <i>was</i> the person with the most power in this situation and he screwed up royally in not giving Catelyn and Jon even the most cursory explanation or assurance. It wouldn\u2019t have fixed things, but it sure would have made it a little bit better for Jon and Catelyn on an emotional level instead of the wild thoughts each agonized over. And while I understand that Ned\u2019s position had him caught between Jon and Cat in a situation where making things better for one largely comes at the expense of the other, I do think that he should have done better by Jon in the matter of Cat\u2019s treatment of him. There are things that I don\u2019t think Ned really saw (i.e, Cat\u2019s refusal to address Jon by his name since she frequently uses Jon\u2019s name in conversations with other people and in her own internal monologues. She just doesn\u2019t address Jon himself by it as per his PoV in AGoT) but he also clearly failed Jon by willfully letting things go, as he did in the matter of him joining the Night\u2019s Watch. His angered reaction to Catelyn\u2019s ultimatum and her previous comment on his protectiveness of Jon suggest that there were places where he put his foot down, but <a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/151352200640/perhaps-im-beating-a-dead-horse-but-im-rereading\" target=\"_blank\">the fact that Ned ultimately takes the relatively easy way out by signing off on Jon\u2019s departure for the Wall is not something I look favorably on him for</a>. Jon\u2019s complicated feelings about his father didn\u2019t come from nowhere.</p><p>That said, I<i> wholly</i> reject the implication that Ned somehow caused Jon\u2019s abuse by not telling Cat the truth about his paternity (or by raising him in Winterfell in the first place as I\u2019ve seen sometimes in other arguments which is another can of worms and a world of hell no). Again, this is an inherently flawed situation due to a societal hierarchy that is broader than everyone involved, but the choice of how to deal with that situation is on the individual characters. Cat\u2019s choice to take out her frustrations on Jon is on Cat, and I dislike the deflection of that responsibility onto Ned. I understand that this builds on analyzing <a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/183269158975/thank-god-someone-finally-said-it-catelyn-was-a\" target=\"_blank\">the situation that Cat was in, which I\u2019m sympathetic to</a>, but it still sidesteps the real issue which is that she was willing to take her resentment and fears out on a child and that shouldn\u2019t be the case even if Jon was Ned\u2019s biological son. The main issue is that Cat shouldn\u2019t have treated Jon like that, not because Jon wasn\u2019t Ned\u2019s but because he was an innocent child that wasn\u2019t responsible for how he came to be. Knowing the truth shouldn\u2019t be the deciding factor on whether Jon gets treated as a person or not. </p>",

Meanwhile her concerns over Jon potentially trying to supplant her children still apply because he is still publicly recognized as Ned\u2019s son, and she can\u2019t very well tell anyone that he is not Ned\u2019s unless she wants to bring everything down on all of their heads. That situation would only augment Cat\u2019s lack of control and her resentment over it. It\u2019s also clear that Ned feared a situation where Cat would have to choose between Jon\u2019s life and her children\u2019s, which is not an unreasonable fear. Basically,<a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/180287170580/hi-sam-love-your-blog-xx-why-do-you-think-ned\" target=\"_blank\"> the truth puts Catelyn in a very bad position, endangers her and endangers Jon</a>, without offering any significant change to the state of affairs in Winterfell. Jon would remain the easiest target for Cat\u2019s resentment. She\u2019d still want to neutralize his double prospective danger as both a Targaryen descendant and Ned\u2019s publicly recognized son. She\u2019d still want a distance between him and her children. And I don\u2019t imagine she\u2019d be particularly enthused about Jon being in Winterfell when Robert comes. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t fault Ned for not telling Cat the truth.</p><p>What I <i>do</i> fault him for is his woeful mishandling of the situation. That the situation was inherently flawed was nobody\u2019s fault, but it is on Ned how he chose to deal with it, and he made a right mess. There is a lot of room between telling Catelyn the truth, and what he did in telling her (and Jon) absolutely nothing, which only served to make a crappy situation worse for everyone involved. Scaring Cat into silence by implementing his patriarchal power was objectively a dick move that amplified her lack of power. Ned\u2019s trauma, protectiveness of Jon, the fact that he is an uncomfortable liar and that this line of questioning hits all of this explain his actions but they don\u2019t make them acceptable. Ned <i>was</i> the person with the most power in this situation and he screwed up royally in not giving Catelyn and Jon even the most cursory explanation or assurance. It wouldn\u2019t have fixed things, but it sure would have made it a little bit better for Jon and Catelyn on an emotional level instead of the wild thoughts each agonized over. And while I understand that Ned\u2019s position had him caught between Jon and Cat in a situation where making things better for one largely comes at the expense of the other, I do think that he should have done better by Jon in the matter of Cat\u2019s treatment of him. There are things that I don\u2019t think Ned really saw (i.e, Cat\u2019s refusal to address Jon by his name since she frequently uses Jon\u2019s name in conversations with other people and in her own internal monologues. She just doesn\u2019t address Jon himself by it as per his PoV in AGoT) but he also clearly failed Jon by willfully letting things go, as he did in the matter of him joining the Night\u2019s Watch. His angered reaction to Catelyn\u2019s ultimatum and her previous comment on his protectiveness of Jon suggest that there were places where he put his foot down, but <a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/151352200640/perhaps-im-beating-a-dead-horse-but-im-rereading\" target=\"_blank\">the fact that Ned ultimately takes the relatively easy way out by signing off on Jon\u2019s departure for the Wall is not something I look favorably on him for</a>. Jon\u2019s complicated feelings about his father didn\u2019t come from nowhere.</p><p>That said, I<i> wholly</i> reject the implication that Ned somehow caused Jon\u2019s abuse by not telling Cat the truth about his paternity (or by raising him in Winterfell in the first place as I\u2019ve seen sometimes in other arguments which is another can of worms and a world of hell no). Again, this is an inherently flawed situation due to a societal hierarchy that is broader than everyone involved, but the choice of how to deal with that situation is on the individual characters. Cat\u2019s choice to take out her frustrations on Jon is on Cat, and I dislike the deflection of that responsibility onto Ned. I understand that this builds on analyzing <a href=\"http://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/183269158975/thank-god-someone-finally-said-it-catelyn-was-a\" target=\"_blank\">the situation that Cat was in, which I\u2019m sympathetic to</a>, but it still sidesteps the real issue which is that she was willing to take her resentment and fears out on a child and that shouldn\u2019t be the case even if Jon was Ned\u2019s biological son. The main issue is that Cat shouldn\u2019t have treated Jon like that, not because Jon wasn\u2019t Ned\u2019s but because he was an innocent child that wasn\u2019t responsible for how he came to be. Knowing the truth shouldn\u2019t be the deciding factor on whether Jon gets treated as a person or not. </p>",
