The familiar noise was almost like music in her\nears. It was an incoming skype call that had her filled with excitement\nthroughout the morning, her work and dinner. She almost sprinted towards her\nlaptop and threw herself onto the bed. A bowl of popcorn and a glass of Ribena on\nher bedside table showed that this was not going to be a short call.<br/></p><p>\u201cHi\nsweetheart, can you hear me?\u201d Dan asked, pressing a few buttons on his mac\nbefore he appeared on the screen and he looked into the camera. </p><p>\u201cYes, loud\nand clear.\u201d Y/N smiled at her boyfriend, whose face she missed dearly. </p><p>He still\nlooked perfect despite the slightly pixely camera. After she saw herself on the\nscreen too, she quickly ran her fingers through her hair to fix it. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so\ngood to see you, I miss you like crazy.\u201d Dan said taking in his girlfriends\nappearance. She was sitting on their bed and wore one of his old t-shirts, that\nlooked huge on her body. He loved the sight of her in his clothes and\nimmediately wished he could be there with her. </p><p>\u201cI miss you\ntoo, handsome. What city are you in today?\u201d She asked and examined Dan\u2019s\nsurroundings. He was leaning against the wooden headboard of a twin sized hotel\nbed. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Brisbane\ntoday and heading to Sydney next. The show today was literally so good. One\ncould really tell that the crowd enjoyed it and that made me quite happy.\u201d Dan\ntold Y/N, who listened carefully to every word he said. </p><p>\u201cI have\nalready seen lots of positive feedback to the tour on Twitter. And I also came\nacross some very cute meet and greet pictures.\u201d She smiled while talking. Y/N\nwas glad she had twitter to stay updated with her boyfriend\u2019s busy life. That\nway she didn\u2019t feel that far away from everything, almost like she was there\nwith them. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\nglad the fans like it. Today Phil was even given some super awesome socks, he\ncan\u2019t wait to wear them. He\u2019s getting less and less nervous with each show, you\nknow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh I\u2019m\nproud of our Philly and of you of course.\u201d Y/N said, puckering her lips and\nmaking a kissing sound. Dan smiled and blew her a kiss in response. </p><p>\u201cPhil\u2019s\nasleep already, all this traveling and being on stage can be pretty tiring.\nAmazing but tiring.\u201d Dan explained supressing a yawn. </p><p>\u201cAnd now\nI\u2019m here keeping you up.\u201d Y/N said with pout, feeling sorry. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stay\nup all night only for you, Y/N. Just being able to hear your voice and see how\npretty you are is worth any amount of tiredness and lack of sleep.\u201d Dan said,\neyeing his girlfriend on the screen lovingly. She made an \u2018aww\u2019 sound and\nblushed in return.</p><p>\u201cBut enough\nabout me, tell me about your day.\u201d He added. </p><p> \u201cThere\u2019s not that much to talk about. I got up\nat 7am, had a decent day at work and made myself some pasta for dinner\u2026 Oh and\nI also dreamt of you.\u201d She told him, replaying her day in her head. </p><p>\u201cYou dreamt\nof me?\u201d Dan asked with a slight smirk on his face. </p><p>\u201cYes, I\neven miss you when I\u2019m asleep.\u201d Y/n explained, smiling into the camera. </p><p>\u201cWhat kind\nof dream was it?\u201d He wanted to know, wiggling his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cDaan!\u201d She\ngroaned hiding her face from him, it was so unfamiliar and new to talk about\nthings like that over skype. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I do\nsome sexy stuff in that dream of yours?\u201d Dan tried, being pretty straight\nforward quite bluntly.</p><p>Y/N\ncouldn\u2019t help but blush a little. She liked dirty talking and she also missed\nDan in that kind of way, but she was only slowly warming up to this online\nthing. </p><p>\u201cuh\u2026maybe\nsome.\u201d She admitted, remembering the 18+ scenes of her dreams where Dan was\ntouching and caressing every part of her body. </p><p>Dan started\nshifting and changing his position. \u201cI probably should remove that laptop from\nmy crotch because well\u2026 my hard on is pressing against it.\u201d He said, looking\ndirectly at her through the screen. </p><p>\u201cOh my god,\nDan.\u201d Y/N whisper-screamed at her boyfriend, taking a pillow from next to her\nand hiding her face with it. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, Phil is in a separate hotel room this time, plus he is asleep.\u201d Dan told\nher, making her drop the pillow and show him a sexy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou always\nget so horny when you\u2019re on your period, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Dan said while\nshaking his head but there was a slight smirk on his face revealing that he\nobviously liked that. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy\nperiod?\u201d Y/N asked and tilted her head sideways. There was a look of confusion\nand surprise on her face as she let go off a little \u2018huh\u2019 sound. The tingling\nsensation in her tummy and downwards had vanished all of a sudden, it almost\nfelt like she had been thrown off track for a few seconds. </p><p>\u201cAh yes,\nshouldn\u2019t you be on it by now?\u201d Dan answered, it wasn\u2019t unusual that he knew her\nperiod was around the corner sooner than she did. He was just better at\nmemorizing dates and knowing what day of the week it was. Y/N\u2019s face went from\nconfused to normal again. </p><p>\u201cTotally\nforgot that it\u2019s almost the end of the month already. I haven\u2019t gotten it yet,\nbut I guess it will surprise me in the next few days.\u201d She explained. </p><p>She was one\nday off, but that wasn\u2019t unusual, right? Irregular periods are not that\nuncommon for her so she didn\u2019t think that much of it. Instead Dan and her kept\ntalking about everything they could think of. Dan swooned over all the\nbeautiful cities he saw, the delicious food he ate and all the people he met.\nY/N told him about her days at work, the weather in London, the fact that her\nmum\u2019s birthday party was in week and the new series she started to watch. It\nwas crazy how different their stories and experiences were. </p><p>At 10pm\nlocal time in London Dan\u2019s eyes started to fall shut ever so often, although he\nreally wanted to stay awake for her, his body demanded sleep. When Y/N realized\nthat it was 4am where her boyfriend currently was, her eyes widened in shock. </p><p>\u201cYou really\nneed to sleep, Dan!\u201d she almost shouted. </p><p>He knew that\nshe right but didn\u2019t want her to be. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to leave.\u201d He whispered starring at Y/N through the camera of his laptop.</p><p>\u201cMe neither\nbut I guess we have to. We can skype again as soon as possible, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\notherwise I would go insane because I miss you so much.\u201d </p><p>She smiled\nat his sweet comment. </p><p>\u201cGoodnight\nDan, I love you.\u201d She then said, knowing that he would have to be up in only a\nfew hours. </p><p>\u201cI love you\ntoo.\u201d He answered and then they ended the call at the same time. </p><p>Y/N turned\noff her laptop, finished the snacks she had prepared earlier and got ready for\nbed. As she slipped under her duvet she was 100% sure that her period was just\na normal day late and would probably start tomorrow or even a day after that.\nThere wasn\u2019t a single doubt about that in her head. She even remember to put a\npad in her underwear, just in case she would get her period during the night. </p><p>But she\ndidn\u2019t\u2026 </p>",

The familiar noise was almost like music in her\nears. It was an incoming skype call that had her filled with excitement\nthroughout the morning, her work and dinner. She almost sprinted towards her\nlaptop and threw herself onto the bed. A bowl of popcorn and a glass of Ribena on\nher bedside table showed that this was not going to be a short call.<br></p><p>\u201cHi\nsweetheart, can you hear me?\u201d Dan asked, pressing a few buttons on his mac\nbefore he appeared on the screen and he looked into the camera. </p><p>\u201cYes, loud\nand clear.\u201d Y/N smiled at her boyfriend, whose face she missed dearly. </p><p>He still\nlooked perfect despite the slightly pixely camera. After she saw herself on the\nscreen too, she quickly ran her fingers through her hair to fix it. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so\ngood to see you, I miss you like crazy.\u201d Dan said taking in his girlfriends\nappearance. She was sitting on their bed and wore one of his old t-shirts, that\nlooked huge on her body. He loved the sight of her in his clothes and\nimmediately wished he could be there with her. </p><p>\u201cI miss you\ntoo, handsome. What city are you in today?\u201d She asked and examined Dan\u2019s\nsurroundings. He was leaning against the wooden headboard of a twin sized hotel\nbed. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Brisbane\ntoday and heading to Sydney next. The show today was literally so good. One\ncould really tell that the crowd enjoyed it and that made me quite happy.\u201d Dan\ntold Y/N, who listened carefully to every word he said. </p><p>\u201cI have\nalready seen lots of positive feedback to the tour on Twitter. And I also came\nacross some very cute meet and greet pictures.\u201d She smiled while talking. Y/N\nwas glad she had twitter to stay updated with her boyfriend\u2019s busy life. That\nway she didn\u2019t feel that far away from everything, almost like she was there\nwith them. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\nglad the fans like it. Today Phil was even given some super awesome socks, he\ncan\u2019t wait to wear them. He\u2019s getting less and less nervous with each show, you\nknow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh I\u2019m\nproud of our Philly and of you of course.\u201d Y/N said, puckering her lips and\nmaking a kissing sound. Dan smiled and blew her a kiss in response. </p><p>\u201cPhil\u2019s\nasleep already, all this traveling and being on stage can be pretty tiring.\nAmazing but tiring.\u201d Dan explained supressing a yawn. </p><p>\u201cAnd now\nI\u2019m here keeping you up.\u201d Y/N said with pout, feeling sorry. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stay\nup all night only for you, Y/N. Just being able to hear your voice and see how\npretty you are is worth any amount of tiredness and lack of sleep.\u201d Dan said,\neyeing his girlfriend on the screen lovingly. She made an \u2018aww\u2019 sound and\nblushed in return.</p><p>\u201cBut enough\nabout me, tell me about your day.\u201d He added. </p><p> \u201cThere\u2019s not that much to talk about. I got up\nat 7am, had a decent day at work and made myself some pasta for dinner\u2026 Oh and\nI also dreamt of you.\u201d She told him, replaying her day in her head. </p><p>\u201cYou dreamt\nof me?\u201d Dan asked with a slight smirk on his face. </p><p>\u201cYes, I\neven miss you when I\u2019m asleep.\u201d Y/n explained, smiling into the camera. </p><p>\u201cWhat kind\nof dream was it?\u201d He wanted to know, wiggling his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cDaan!\u201d She\ngroaned hiding her face from him, it was so unfamiliar and new to talk about\nthings like that over skype. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid I do\nsome sexy stuff in that dream of yours?\u201d Dan tried, being pretty straight\nforward quite bluntly.</p><p>Y/N\ncouldn\u2019t help but blush a little. She liked dirty talking and she also missed\nDan in that kind of way, but she was only slowly warming up to this online\nthing. </p><p>\u201cuh\u2026maybe\nsome.\u201d She admitted, remembering the 18+ scenes of her dreams where Dan was\ntouching and caressing every part of her body. </p><p>Dan started\nshifting and changing his position. \u201cI probably should remove that laptop from\nmy crotch because well\u2026 my hard on is pressing against it.\u201d He said, looking\ndirectly at her through the screen. </p><p>\u201cOh my god,\nDan.\u201d Y/N whisper-screamed at her boyfriend, taking a pillow from next to her\nand hiding her face with it. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry, Phil is in a separate hotel room this time, plus he is asleep.\u201d Dan told\nher, making her drop the pillow and show him a sexy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou always\nget so horny when you\u2019re on your period, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Dan said while\nshaking his head but there was a slight smirk on his face revealing that he\nobviously liked that. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy\nperiod?\u201d Y/N asked and tilted her head sideways. There was a look of confusion\nand surprise on her face as she let go off a little \u2018huh\u2019 sound. The tingling\nsensation in her tummy and downwards had vanished all of a sudden, it almost\nfelt like she had been thrown off track for a few seconds. </p><p>\u201cAh yes,\nshouldn\u2019t you be on it by now?\u201d Dan answered, it wasn\u2019t unusual that he knew her\nperiod was around the corner sooner than she did. He was just better at\nmemorizing dates and knowing what day of the week it was. Y/N\u2019s face went from\nconfused to normal again. </p><p>\u201cTotally\nforgot that it\u2019s almost the end of the month already. I haven\u2019t gotten it yet,\nbut I guess it will surprise me in the next few days.\u201d She explained. </p><p>She was one\nday off, but that wasn\u2019t unusual, right? Irregular periods are not that\nuncommon for her so she didn\u2019t think that much of it. Instead Dan and her kept\ntalking about everything they could think of. Dan swooned over all the\nbeautiful cities he saw, the delicious food he ate and all the people he met.\nY/N told him about her days at work, the weather in London, the fact that her\nmum\u2019s birthday party was in week and the new series she started to watch. It\nwas crazy how different their stories and experiences were. </p><p>At 10pm\nlocal time in London Dan\u2019s eyes started to fall shut ever so often, although he\nreally wanted to stay awake for her, his body demanded sleep. When Y/N realized\nthat it was 4am where her boyfriend currently was, her eyes widened in shock. </p><p>\u201cYou really\nneed to sleep, Dan!\u201d she almost shouted. </p><p>He knew that\nshe right but didn\u2019t want her to be. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to leave.\u201d He whispered starring at Y/N through the camera of his laptop.</p><p>\u201cMe neither\nbut I guess we have to. We can skype again as soon as possible, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\notherwise I would go insane because I miss you so much.\u201d </p><p>She smiled\nat his sweet comment. </p><p>\u201cGoodnight\nDan, I love you.\u201d She then said, knowing that he would have to be up in only a\nfew hours. </p><p>\u201cI love you\ntoo.\u201d He answered and then they ended the call at the same time. </p><p>Y/N turned\noff her laptop, finished the snacks she had prepared earlier and got ready for\nbed. As she slipped under her duvet she was 100% sure that her period was just\na normal day late and would probably start tomorrow or even a day after that.\nThere wasn\u2019t a single doubt about that in her head. She even remember to put a\npad in her underwear, just in case she would get her period during the night. </p><p>But she\ndidn\u2019t\u2026 </p></p>",
