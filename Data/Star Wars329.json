Because Leia\u2019s story will not conclude as originally envisioned, and because fans wanted the iconic hero to get a deserving send-off, some launched a petition to have the role recast with Meryl Streep. Others suggested they employ similar technology used in\u00a0<em>Rogue One</em> and have character return via CGI. Todd himself told the\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/late-carrie-fisher-final-star-wars-movie-article-1.3030154\">New York Daily News</a></em>\u00a0in 2017 that his late sister would appear in the upcoming\u00a0<em>Episode IX</em>\u00a0via unused footage.

(Photo: Tim Boxer/Getty Images)</figcaption><p>\u201cObviously Lucasfilm and Disney, they own Carrie\u2019s likeness,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cGeorge owned it [before selling Lucasfilm]. In fact, Carrie famously used to joke that every time she looks in the mirror, she has to send George a couple of bucks. Now Disney\u2019s got it. And what they do with it is up to them.</p> <p>\u201cI can tell you from my perspective, as the brother of Princess Leia, I would love it if they would carry on with Carrie,\u201d Fisher said with a smile. \u201cI mean how do you separate Princess Leia at this point from all of that? I mean it is a foundation of the story. She is a pivotal character that the world has come to love. Technically, obviously, we live in a time where that could be done easily where she could be brought in and out. I would love it.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if it was difficult to watch his sister in the movies, Todd acknowledged one moment in the\u00a0<em>The Last Jedi</em> was emotionally heavy.</p> <p><b></b>\u201cI loved <em>The Last Jedi</em> and I the only thing that was difficult was the scene with Carrie in a coma \u2014 that was startling,\u201d Fisher shared. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in the theater and Carrie had just been in a coma in real life and doesn\u2019t make it. And, you know, as the brother you\u2019re like, \u2018What am I watching here?\u2019<i>\u201c</i></p> <h3>\u201cShe was chosen to lead <em>your</em> resistance.\u201d</h3> <p>While the\u00a0<em>Star Wars</em> franchise might no longer feature Princess Leia, she\u2019s alive and well as a symbol for the Trump-era \u201cresistance\u201d movement. The <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2017/01/carrie-fisher-princess-leia-womens-march-signs-donald-trump-1201772005/\">Women\u2019s March</a>\u00a0has been just one of several political events that Carrie Fisher\u2019s Leia was a prominent symbol on pickets.</p> <p>\u201cCarrie was outspoken,\u201d Todd pointed out. \u201cShe was she was a powerful woman who didn\u2019t take anything off of anybody and I shudder to think if you want to go up against Carrie. She also lived her life in an inspirational way. This is a woman that suffered from bipolar disorder, drug addiction. And yet through all of that was able to accomplish so many things.\u201d</p> <p><em>Princess Leia was featured on many signs at the Women\u2019s March in 2017:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I know where she stood.

And when the movement was taking place in Washington and they had Carrie\u2019s picture you know, the Princess Leia picture, I mean I knew she\u2019d be happy with that. It wasn\u2019t about the politics.

And even though she landed a lead role in a major studio film, Carrie wondered whether appearing in the strange new sci-fi adventure titled <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/star-wars\"><em>Star Wars</em></a>\u00a0would do irreparable damage to her acting career.</p> <p>Her younger brother, Todd Fisher, was by her side during the making of<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/george-lucas\">\u00a0George Lucas</a>\u2018s film and at the world premiere. He joined Yahoo Entertainment in Los Angeles to share what it was like to accompany Carrie on the cusp of superstardom.</p> <h3>\u201cShe was squeezing my hand, panicked.\u201d</h3> <p><b></b>\u201cI was with [Carrie] in England when the movie was being made,\u201d says Fisher, whose <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062792310/my-girls/\">new memoir,\u00a0<em>My Girls</em></a>, offers a peek at what it was like to grow up in Hollywood with Carrie and mother Debbie Reynolds. \u201cIt was cool. There was these big sets and it had a certain amount of impressiveness to the sets. But you know you couldn\u2019t obviously see any of the effects so you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming. And you know, people [thought Lucas was] all nuts. He\u2019s got this giant 7-foot carpet running around called a Wookiee. \u2026</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re sitting in the parking lot waiting to go into the screening,\u201d Fisher continued. \u201cNow, this is the first time anybody\u2019s seen anything. This is days before it comes out to the theaters. She\u2019s smoking, chain-smoking, drinking \u2014\u00a0 Coca-Cola in one hand, cigarette in the other hand. She just doesn\u2019t want to go and I\u2019m like, \u2018You know we\u2019ve got to go in.\u2019\u00a0 I\u2019m sitting there watching the lights go down, you know, literally doors are closing. \u2018We\u2019ve got to go now.\u2019 So I finally get her to put her cigarette out. By this point there\u2019s nowhere to sit except the front row. So we sit in the front row and it starts and we watch those titles go by and then the battlecruiser flies over and I looked over, and I had her hand, she was squeezing my hand, panicked. I said, \u2018This is no B-movie.\u2018\u201d</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"357\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/db5bfc0376992234a6040ce5ac2d7821/tumblr_inline_payn35ISq91uwsgms_540.jpg\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7db048f0774259a76c70129081044e42/tumblr_inline_payn3r9gOw1uwsgms_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"357\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/db5bfc0376992234a6040ce5ac2d7821/tumblr_inline_payn35ISq91uwsgms_540.jpg\"></figure><figcaption>Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in <i>Star Wars</i> (1977).

I think she was the only one that noticed. I don\u2019t think anybody cared! She was trained at the London Dramatic Academy. And of course they made you do Elizabethan English and such so you did have a tendency, if you\u2019re being dramatic, to break loose with the British accent.\u201d</p> <h3>\u201cAs the brother of Princess Leia, I would love it if they would carry on with Carrie.\u201d</h3> <p>When Carrie Fisher died unexpectedly in 2016, the producers of Star Wars had to rework the script to the upcoming <em>Episode IX</em>, due out in 2019 because the actress was to have a major role. Because Leia\u2019s story will not conclude as originally envisioned, and because fans wanted the iconic hero to get a deserving send-off, some launched a petition to have the role recast with Meryl Streep. Others suggested they employ similar technology used in\u00a0<em>Rogue One</em> and have character return via CGI.

He joined Yahoo Entertainment in Los Angeles to share what it was like to accompany Carrie on the cusp of superstardom.</p> <h3>&ldquo;She was squeezing my hand, panicked.&rdquo;</h3> <p><b></b>&ldquo;I was with [Carrie] in England when the movie was being made,&rdquo; says Fisher, whose <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062792310/my-girls/\">new memoir,&nbsp;<em>My Girls</em></a>, offers a peek at what it was like to grow up in Hollywood with Carrie and mother Debbie Reynolds. &ldquo;It was cool. There was these big sets and it had a certain amount of impressiveness to the sets. But you know you couldn&rsquo;t obviously see any of the effects so you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming. And you know, people [thought Lucas was] all nuts. He&rsquo;s got this giant 7-foot carpet running around called a Wookiee. &hellip;</p> <p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re sitting in the parking lot waiting to go into the screening,&rdquo; Fisher continued. &ldquo;Now, this is the first time anybody&rsquo;s seen anything. This is days before it comes out to the theaters. She&rsquo;s smoking, chain-smoking, drinking &mdash;&nbsp; Coca-Cola in one hand, cigarette in the other hand. She just doesn&rsquo;t want to go and I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;You know we&rsquo;ve got to go in.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sitting there watching the lights go down, you know, literally doors are closing. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go now.&rsquo; So I finally get her to put her cigarette out. By this point there&rsquo;s nowhere to sit except the front row. So we sit in the front row and it starts and we watch those titles go by and then the battlecruiser flies over and I looked over, and I had her hand, she was squeezing my hand, panicked. I said, &lsquo;This is no B-movie.&lsquo;&rdquo;</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7db048f0774259a76c70129081044e42/tumblr_inline_payn3r9gOw1uwsgms_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure>Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in <i>Star Wars</i> (1977). Fisher&rsquo;s brother Todd told Yahoo Entertainment that she &ldquo;freaked out&rdquo; when she saw they included a scene with her using a British accent. (Photo: Everett Collection)<p>Toward the end of her life, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/carrie-fisher-british-accent-star-wars-article-1.2457675\">Carrie embraced her affected British accent</a> in her scene with the &ldquo;foul&rdquo; Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), but in 1977 she was horrified that it was being used in the final cut of the film.</p> <p>&ldquo;She was she freaked out when that was used because out of nowhere, the whole movie she has no British accent, and all of the sudden she has a British accent,&rdquo; Fisher told us. &ldquo;But you know what? I think she was the only one that noticed. I don&rsquo;t think anybody cared! She was trained at the London Dramatic Academy. And of course they made you do Elizabethan English and such so you did have a tendency, if you&rsquo;re being dramatic, to break loose with the British accent.&rdquo;</p> <h3>&ldquo;As the brother of Princess Leia, I would love it if they would carry on with Carrie.&rdquo;</h3> <p>When Carrie Fisher died unexpectedly in 2016, the producers of Star Wars had to rework the script to the upcoming <em>Episode IX</em>, due out in 2019 because the actress was to have a major role. Because Leia&rsquo;s story will not conclude as originally envisioned, and because fans wanted the iconic hero to get a deserving send-off, some launched a petition to have the role recast with Meryl Streep. Others suggested they employ similar technology used in&nbsp;<em>Rogue One</em> and have character return via CGI. Todd himself told the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/late-carrie-fisher-final-star-wars-movie-article-1.3030154\">New York Daily News</a></em>&nbsp;in 2017 that his late sister would appear in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Episode IX</em>&nbsp;via unused footage. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/carrie-fishers-princess-leia-star-wars-episode-ix-not-fast-says-lucasfilm-boss-kathleen-kennedy-202827816.html\">Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy refuted that notion in a conversation with Yahoo</a> at <em>Star Wars</em> Celebration a few weeks later, saying,&nbsp;&ldquo;I have no idea why he said that.&rdquo; Lucasfilm soon after released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/a-statement-regarding-new-rumors\">a statement</a>&nbsp;saying the studio had &ldquo;no plans to digitally recreate Carrie Fisher&rsquo;s performance as Princess or General Leia Organa&rdquo; in future movies.</p> <p>Todd knows that the decision is out of his hands, but still hopes&nbsp;<em>The Last Jedi</em> won&rsquo;t be the last movie Carrie appears in.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0849c622968b024eaf490f134c33acb1/tumblr_inline_payn3sRIvp1uwsgms_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure>Carrie Fisher (left) stands with her mother Debbie Reynolds, and her brother Todd Fisher at the premiere party for Reynolds&rsquo;s play <i>Irene</i> in New York on March 13, 1973, four years before <i>Star Wars</i> would arrive in theaters. (Photo: Tim Boxer/Getty Images)<p>&ldquo;Obviously Lucasfilm and Disney, they own Carrie&rsquo;s likeness,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;George owned it [before selling Lucasfilm]. In fact, Carrie famously used to joke that every time she looks in the mirror, she has to send George a couple of bucks. Now Disney&rsquo;s got it. And what they do with it is up to them.</p> <p>&ldquo;I can tell you from my perspective, as the brother of Princess Leia, I would love it if they would carry on with Carrie,&rdquo; Fisher said with a smile. &ldquo;I mean how do you separate Princess Leia at this point from all of that? I mean it is a foundation of the story. She is a pivotal character that the world has come to love. Technically, obviously, we live in a time where that could be done easily where she could be brought in and out. I would love it.&rdquo;</p> <p>When asked if it was difficult to watch his sister in the movies, Todd acknowledged one moment in the&nbsp;<em>The Last Jedi</em> was emotionally heavy.</p> <p><b></b>&ldquo;I loved <em>The Last Jedi</em> and I the only thing that was difficult was the scene with Carrie in a coma &mdash; that was startling,&rdquo; Fisher shared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sitting in the theater and Carrie had just been in a coma in real life and doesn&rsquo;t make it. And, you know, as the brother you&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;What am I watching here?&rsquo;<i>&ldquo;</i></p> <h3>&ldquo;She was chosen to lead <em>your</em> resistance.&rdquo;</h3> <p>While the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> franchise might no longer feature Princess Leia, she&rsquo;s alive and well as a symbol for the Trump-era &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; movement. The <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2017/01/carrie-fisher-princess-leia-womens-march-signs-donald-trump-1201772005/\">Women&rsquo;s March</a>&nbsp;has been just one of several political events that Carrie Fisher&rsquo;s Leia was a prominent symbol on pickets.</p> <p>&ldquo;Carrie was outspoken,&rdquo; Todd pointed out. &ldquo;She was she was a powerful woman who didn&rsquo;t take anything off of anybody and I shudder to think if you want to go up against Carrie. She also lived her life in an inspirational way. This is a woman that suffered from bipolar disorder, drug addiction. And yet through all of that was able to accomplish so many things.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>Princess Leia was featured on many signs at the Women&rsquo;s March in 2017:</em></p> <blockquote> <p>I know where she stood. You know where she stood. Such an honor to see her standing with you today. Bigly. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Resistance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Resistance</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldWideWomensMarch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WorldWideWomensMarch</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cwsgoYVSU7\">pic.twitter.com/cwsgoYVSU7</a></p> <p>&mdash; Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/822938477989769217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 21, 2017</a></p></blockquote> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all how you look at it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;And she looked at life from the bright side in that regard and survived really well. And when the movement was taking place in Washington and they had Carrie&rsquo;s picture you know, the Princess Leia picture, I mean I knew she&rsquo;d be happy with that. It wasn&rsquo;t about the politics. It was just about the idea that she was chosen to lead <em>your</em> resistance&hellip;whatever that meant to you.&rdquo;</p> <p><em><strong>My Girls</strong></em><strong> is currently available in stores and online.</strong></p> <p><em>Watch: The writers of&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Last Action Hero<em> reveal how</em><em>&nbsp;Carrie Fisher contributed to their movie:</em></p> <figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure> <p><strong>Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/return-jedi-35-secret-history-leias-golden-bikini-131634526.html\">&lsquo;Return of the Jedi&rsquo; at 35: The secret history of Leia&rsquo;s golden bikini</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/star-wars-episode-ix-can-give-princess-leia-ending-deserves-192225559.html\">How &lsquo;Star Wars: Episode IX&rsquo; can give Princess Leia the ending she deserves</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/last-jedi-easter-eggs-callbacks-cameos-new-star-wars-spoilers-022746122.html\">&lsquo;The Last Jedi&rsquo;: All the Easter eggs, callbacks, and cameos in the new &lsquo;Star Wars&rsquo; (spoilers!)</a></li> </ul></p>",
