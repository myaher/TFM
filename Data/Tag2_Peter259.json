You could barely find the will inside you to drag yourself out of bed. You would have stayed home and slept in all day, probably watch some scary movies given the Autumnal mood you were in due to the weather changing. </p><p>Yes, absolutely. That is definitely how you would spend your day, had it not been for the extremely important AP English Lit presentation you were doing that day.</p><p>When you finally dragged yourself out of bed and out of the house, you immediately were greeted by pouring rain and your foot sank into a mud puddle. Just your luck.</p><p>Then, because you slept through your alarm, you missed the bus and had to walk to a block in the rain to school.</p><p>And finally, it was time for your presentation. It had to have been because you were already having a miserable day combined with the raging migraine you had, because you couldn\u2019t focus during your presentation and completely missed what you were going to say.</p><p>To make things even worse, you didn\u2019t get to see Peter all day because he was away at an Academic Decathlon tournament. You couldn\u2019t text him, either, as he\u2019s far too busy trying to memorize answers than to be on his phone.</p><p>So there you were, walking down your block on your way home from school, wiping tears away from your eyes.</p><p>It was the first day of fall, your favorite season. You\u2019d been looking forward to it all year. The leaves that fell onto the sidewalk as you walked on it only made you more upset that you were having a bad day, as you so desperately wished to have an amazing first day of fall.</p><p>You plopped your school bag on your bed with a thud, watching your mattress bend to its weight. You fell upon your mattress too, covering your face with your pillow. You thought about all the homework you had and how much you didn\u2019t want to do it.</p><p>Just then, your phone started ringing. It took a few rings before you had the energy to reach for it out of your bag. Upon seeing your boyfriend\u2019s name on the phone, you quickly wiped your tears from your cheeks and answered with the best cheery voice you could muster.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter.\u201d You said, trying not to sound like you\u2019d just been crying. That obviously didn\u2019t work, as your boyfriend\u2019s voice didn\u2019t sound as vibrant as it usually was when he replied.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe. You okay? You sound&hellip; sick or something.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. You forgot your sinus infection made your voice sound like you were literally dying.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I woke up feeling like trash. How did your tournament go?\u201d You tried to sound normal but your clogged nose proved to reign over your vocal chords once more. At least your headache was starting to go away.</p><p>\u201cIt went great! We won by one point.\u201d Peter apologized for your sickness to which you thanked him for being so caring.</p><p>\u201cWell I was gonna invite you over to show you something, but if you don\u2019t feel good you don\u2019t have to. I know you\u2019re dying to curl up in a ball under covers and watch Netflix.\u201d He said, earnestness in his voice. You smiled at how well he knew you.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019d love to come over. I\u2019ve had the worst day ever and I just want to see you.\u201d You felt your heart leap at the thought of seeing him.</p><p>\u201cOkay! Can I pick you up in ten minutes?\u201d Peter asks.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>When you hang up, you go to the bathroom to take an Advil and swig of DayQuil to alleviate the heavy feeing in your chest. You flinched at the bitter taste of the medicine.</p><p>You barely had time to change out of your drenched clothes before Peter was knocking at your door to pick you up.</p><p>On the short ride to his house, you told him all about your terrible day.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I\u2019m so sorry. I hope you feel better soon. We have so many fun things to do this fall!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll be better soon, hopefully.\u201d</p><p>A lull of silence passed before Peter spoke again. \u201cSo, I have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to him as he pulled into his garage and put the car in park. \u201cYou do? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t show you yet. We have to wait until it\u2019s dark out.\u201d He flashed you a cheeky smile.</p><p>When you go inside his home, you\u2019re greeted by a wistful looking Aunt May. \u201cHey, hun. Peter told me you were sick. Is there anything you want? Some tea or medicine?\u201d She asked you in the warm voice she always possessed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some tea, actually. Thank you so much, May.\u201d You smiled at her. You loved how you always felt genuinely welcomed by her whenever you came over.</p><p>To pass the time until it was dark out, you, Peter, and Aunt May sat around the kitchen table and played card and board games. You were betting Halloween candy instead of money during poker, and you defended your title of reigning champion of Candy Land yet again. You were having so much fun, you almost completely forgot about the atrocious day you had.</p><p>Finally, after a hard loss at UNO, night fell and Peter was getting ready to show you his surprise. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t open your eyes until I tell you to.\u201d He had a kind of childlike giddy in his voice that you thought sounded so adorable.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>Peter had his left hand holding your right one, and his other hand holding a hefty flashlight. You stepped outside to the frigid New York autumn weather, walking about ten steps before Peter stopped you by placing a hand on your shoulder. When he cued you to open your eyes, you almost couldn\u2019t believe what you were seeing.</p><p>In front of you was an erected camping tent big enough for three people at least complete with a ton of fluffy blankets and snacks, and a burning campfire with two logs to sit on. You chucked in disbelief at the sight.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it? I remember you saying once that you\u2019ve always wanted to go camping in the country but that there are no good places to do it in Queens. I tried my best to replicate a camping site. How did I do?\u201d Peter started rambling from his nerves. He probably took your silence as disliking his set up.</p><p>\u201cPeter. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s adorable. You\u2019re adorable.\u201d You hugged him then, and the heat of his body reminded you of the chilly air blowing over your face. You felt him relax when you assured him you loved the surprise.</p><p>You and Peter both crawled into the tent, cuddling up to each other right away. The ground was surprisingly comfortable to lay on. You looked up and saw a clear panel out of the roof of the tent. \u201cLook! We can stargaze while we\u2019re laying in here.\u201d You said, pointing up at the sky. You felt your boyfriend smile next to you.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna say something really cheesy but I decided to spare you.\u201d</p><p>You talked while still staring up at the stars, \u201cNo, say it! You have to now. Doesn\u2019t matter how cheesy it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I was just gonna say that you\u2019re the brightest star out of them all.\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cOh man, that was cheesy.\u201d You said through gritted teeth, causing both you and Peter to erupt in laughter. He sarcastically thanked you for your back-handed compliment.</p><p>You repositioned yourself to become more comfortable. You laid your head in the crook of Peter\u2019s shoulder, resting your arm across his torso. Your knee slightly rested on his calf, and his cheek laid on your head. You smiled into the position, smelling Peter\u2019s cologne. \u201cI love you.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Y/N.\u201d He placed a gentle kiss on your head.</p><p>Not ten minutes passed before you were talking again. \u201cHey Peter?\u201d You asked, shifting your eyes up to look at him.</p><p>His eyes were closed as he answered you. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m freezing.\u201d You whispered this time.</p><p>\u201cMe too. Let\u2019s sleep inside and pretend like we slept in here.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at his willingness to go back into the comfort of his room. \u201cOkay, sure.\u201d The two of you sat up and carried your blankets into the house.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any WiFi out there, either. Also, like, coyotes and stuff.\u201d Peter said, making you laugh out loud at how he seemed to value the WiFi more than his life.</p><p>You and Peter carefully settled back into his bed, but not before you took some NightQuil to aid you to sleep and alleviate your illness. You fell into the same position as last time.</p><p>\u201cAh, warmth.\u201d He said, sinking into the mattress. His hand found your back and started scratching softly, making goosebumps appear on your skin. Your eyes fluttered shut at the therapeutic feeling.</p><p>\u201cAh, WiFi.\u201d </p><p>Peter stifled a laugh as you giggled at your own joke, kissing your forehead yet again before you wished each other goodnight. </p>",

I\u2019ll be better soon, hopefully.\u201d</p><p>A lull of silence passed before Peter spoke again. \u201cSo, I have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to him as he pulled into his garage and put the car in park. \u201cYou do? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t show you yet. We have to wait until it\u2019s dark out.\u201d He flashed you a cheeky smile.</p><p>When you go inside his home, you\u2019re greeted by a wistful looking Aunt May. \u201cHey, hun. Peter told me you were sick. Is there anything you want? Some tea or medicine?\u201d She asked you in the warm voice she always possessed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some tea, actually. Thank you so much, May.\u201d You smiled at her. You loved how you always felt genuinely welcomed by her whenever you came over.</p><p>To pass the time until it was dark out, you, Peter, and Aunt May sat around the kitchen table and played card and board games. You were betting Halloween candy instead of money during poker, and you defended your title of reigning champion of Candy Land yet again. You were having so much fun, you almost completely forgot about the atrocious day you had.</p><p>Finally, after a hard loss at UNO, night fell and Peter was getting ready to show you his surprise. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t open your eyes until I tell you to.\u201d He had a kind of childlike giddy in his voice that you thought sounded so adorable.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>Peter had his left hand holding your right one, and his other hand holding a hefty flashlight. You stepped outside to the frigid New York autumn weather, walking about ten steps before Peter stopped you by placing a hand on your shoulder. When he cued you to open your eyes, you almost couldn\u2019t believe what you were seeing.</p><p>In front of you was an erected camping tent big enough for three people at least complete with a ton of fluffy blankets and snacks, and a burning campfire with two logs to sit on. You chucked in disbelief at the sight.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it? I remember you saying once that you\u2019ve always wanted to go camping in the country but that there are no good places to do it in Queens. I tried my best to replicate a camping site. How did I do?\u201d Peter started rambling from his nerves. He probably took your silence as disliking his set up.</p><p>\u201cPeter. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s adorable. You\u2019re adorable.\u201d You hugged him then, and the heat of his body reminded you of the chilly air blowing over your face. You felt him relax when you assured him you loved the surprise.</p><p>You and Peter both crawled into the tent, cuddling up to each other right away. The ground was surprisingly comfortable to lay on. You looked up and saw a clear panel out of the roof of the tent. \u201cLook! We can stargaze while we\u2019re laying in here.\u201d You said, pointing up at the sky. You felt your boyfriend smile next to you.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna say something really cheesy but I decided to spare you.\u201d</p><p>You talked while still staring up at the stars, \u201cNo, say it! You have to now. Doesn\u2019t matter how cheesy it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I was just gonna say that you\u2019re the brightest star out of them all.\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cOh man, that was cheesy.\u201d You said through gritted teeth, causing both you and Peter to erupt in laughter. He sarcastically thanked you for your back-handed compliment.</p><p>You repositioned yourself to become more comfortable. You laid your head in the crook of Peter\u2019s shoulder, resting your arm across his torso. Your knee slightly rested on his calf, and his cheek laid on your head. You smiled into the position, smelling Peter\u2019s cologne. \u201cI love you.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Y/N.\u201d He placed a gentle kiss on your head.</p><p>Not ten minutes passed before you were talking again. \u201cHey Peter?\u201d You asked, shifting your eyes up to look at him.</p><p>His eyes were closed as he answered you. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m freezing.\u201d You whispered this time.</p><p>\u201cMe too. Let\u2019s sleep inside and pretend like we slept in here.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at his willingness to go back into the comfort of his room. \u201cOkay, sure.\u201d The two of you sat up and carried your blankets into the house.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any WiFi out there, either. Also, like, coyotes and stuff.\u201d Peter said, making you laugh out loud at how he seemed to value the WiFi more than his life.</p><p>You and Peter carefully settled back into his bed, but not before you took some NightQuil to aid you to sleep and alleviate your illness. You fell into the same position as last time.</p><p>\u201cAh, warmth.\u201d He said, sinking into the mattress. His hand found your back and started scratching softly, making goosebumps appear on your skin. Your eyes fluttered shut at the therapeutic feeling.</p><p>\u201cAh, WiFi.\u201d </p><p>Peter stifled a laugh as you giggled at your own joke, kissing your forehead yet again before you wished each other goodnight. </p></p>",

You could barely find the will inside you to drag yourself out of bed. You would have stayed home and slept in all day, probably watch some scary movies given the Autumnal mood you were in due to the weather changing. </p><p>Yes, absolutely. That is definitely how you would spend your day, had it not been for the extremely important AP English Lit presentation you were doing that day.</p><p>When you finally dragged yourself out of bed and out of the house, you immediately were greeted by pouring rain and your foot sank into a mud puddle. Just your luck.</p><p>Then, because you slept through your alarm, you missed the bus and had to walk to a block in the rain to school.</p><p>And finally, it was time for your presentation. It had to have been because you were already having a miserable day combined with the raging migraine you had, because you couldn&rsquo;t focus during your presentation and completely missed what you were going to say.</p><p>To make things even worse, you didn&rsquo;t get to see Peter all day because he was away at an Academic Decathlon tournament. You couldn&rsquo;t text him, either, as he&rsquo;s far too busy trying to memorize answers than to be on his phone.</p><p>So there you were, walking down your block on your way home from school, wiping tears away from your eyes.</p><p>It was the first day of fall, your favorite season. You&rsquo;d been looking forward to it all year. The leaves that fell onto the sidewalk as you walked on it only made you more upset that you were having a bad day, as you so desperately wished to have an amazing first day of fall.</p><p>You plopped your school bag on your bed with a thud, watching your mattress bend to its weight. You fell upon your mattress too, covering your face with your pillow. You thought about all the homework you had and how much you didn&rsquo;t want to do it.</p><p>Just then, your phone started ringing. It took a few rings before you had the energy to reach for it out of your bag. Upon seeing your boyfriend&rsquo;s name on the phone, you quickly wiped your tears from your cheeks and answered with the best cheery voice you could muster.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter.&rdquo; You said, trying not to sound like you&rsquo;d just been crying. That obviously didn&rsquo;t work, as your boyfriend&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t sound as vibrant as it usually was when he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, babe. You okay? You sound&hellip; sick or something.&rdquo;</p><p>Damn it. You forgot your sinus infection made your voice sound like you were literally dying.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, I woke up feeling like trash. How did your tournament go?&rdquo; You tried to sound normal but your clogged nose proved to reign over your vocal chords once more. At least your headache was starting to go away.</p><p>&ldquo;It went great! We won by one point.&rdquo; Peter apologized for your sickness to which you thanked him for being so caring.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I was gonna invite you over to show you something, but if you don&rsquo;t feel good you don&rsquo;t have to. I know you&rsquo;re dying to curl up in a ball under covers and watch Netflix.&rdquo; He said, earnestness in his voice. You smiled at how well he knew you.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;d love to come over. I&rsquo;ve had the worst day ever and I just want to see you.&rdquo; You felt your heart leap at the thought of seeing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay! Can I pick you up in ten minutes?&rdquo; Peter asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely. See you soon.&rdquo;</p><p>When you hang up, you go to the bathroom to take an Advil and swig of DayQuil to alleviate the heavy feeing in your chest. You flinched at the bitter taste of the medicine.</p><p>You barely had time to change out of your drenched clothes before Peter was knocking at your door to pick you up.</p><p>On the short ride to his house, you told him all about your terrible day.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe, I&rsquo;m so sorry.

He\u2019s like the long lost Avenger and literally EVERYWHERE on the News\u201c Ned said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s crazy. Spiderman, your friendly Neighborhood-Hero while all the other ones are protecting the world from alien invasions\u201d, you joked, earning a chuckle from Ned. </p><p>After a few minutes of eating in comfortable silence, Ned turned his head to you. </p><p>\u201eSo, what do you think of Peter?\u201c</p><p>\u201eApart from that weird goodbye yesterday, he\u2018s actually pretty fun. You might have found someone I\u2018m cool with, congratulations Ned\u201c </p><p>You saw your best friend grinning widely, clearly proud of himself. </p><p>\u201eHe was shitscared to meet you, because of your reputation and stuff. But I think he quickly realized that you\u2018re not half as bad as people make you out to be\u201c</p><p>\u201eOh wow, thank you for that. Very comforting\u201c, you said sarcastically. </p><p>\u201eYou know what I mean\u201c</p><p>\u201eSure. I have to go now, Tessa needs her morning cuddles\u201c, you said in a cold tone. </p><p>\u201eY/N, look, I\u2018m sorry. I know these rumours about you aren\u2018t true\u201c</p><p>\u201eI know that you and Michelle don\u2018t believe them, but that\u2018s about it. See, I\u2018m aware of the fact that I\u2018m not the most open-hearted person out there, but they make me look like a monster sometimes. I\u2018m not the cold bitch that they\u2018re always talking about\u201c</p><p>\u201eI know, Y/N\u201c, Ned pulled you in for one of his bear-hugs, \u201eTheir opinion doesn\u2018t matter, alright? If they actually took the time to get to know you, they would see what a beautiful, funny, intelligent and caring person you are. It takes a bit of time to earn your trust, but it\u2018s absolutely worth it, because I couldn\u2018t ask for a better friend than you\u201c</p><p>\u201eThank you, Ned. See you later\u201c</p><p>And with that, you went home to your dog Tessa.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><b>From: MJ</b></p><p><b>\u201eNed and Peter are going to this lame party at Liz\u2018s house, should we go too? Just to make sure they\u2018re being respectful to the ladies, of course\u201c</b></p><p>You chuckled at the text you\u2018ve just received. Typical MJ. </p><p><b>To: MJ</b></p><p><b>\u201eSure, I don\u2018t have other plans for later anyways, so we might as well pretend that we\u2018re enjoying ourselves at a house party.

You haven\u2018t seen the boys yet, so MJ and you decided to watch the current beerpong match. After a while of cheering and acting like you cared, you realized your cup was empty.  </p><p>\u201eI\u2018ll go get another drink. You good?\u201c you asked Michelle, who nodded in agreement. </p><p>You were about to enter the kitchen, as two arms snaked around your waist from behind. </p><p>\u201eHey pretty girl, wanna have some fun?\u201c, a deep, raspy voice whispered in your ear, sending shivers down your spine. One of his hands traveled down to your butt and squeezed it. In an instant you swatted his hand away and turned around to face him. </p><p>\u201eYou better get your hands off of me\u201c, you hissed, but he only chuckled and grabbed your wrists firmly. </p><p>\u201eOr what?\u201c, he asked you with a twisted smirk. </p><p>\u201eOr I\u2018ll punch that stupid smile off your face\u201c, another voice answered and you looked around to see who it was. </p><p>Ned was standing there in disbelief, processing the words that just came out of Peter\u2018s mouth. </p><p>\u201eDude, he\u2018s gonna crush you\u201c, Ned whispered to him. </p><p>\u201eMaybe, but he\u2018ll leave Y/N alone\u201c</p><p>The grip around your wrists loosened and the stranger walked up to Peter. </p><p>\u201eBrave of you, kiddo. Aren\u2018t you supposed to be in bed right now?\u201c </p><p>People were gathering around the two of them, some already filming on their phones, others chuckling at the previous comment. </p><p><i>Oh no. This is bad. </i></p><p>But to your surprise, Peter dodged the first punch coming towards him, causing the other guy to stumble past him into the crowd. It continued like this for a while - Peter just constantly dodging hits, because the other guy was drunk and clumsy and Peter too polite to actually hurt him, even though he knew he easily could.</p><p>In the meantime, MJ found Liz and told her about what was going on. She was clearly pissed when she found out that two guys were having a fight inside her living room. </p><p>\u201eWhat the hell is going on?\u201c, she screamed, causing them to stop in their tracks. After a few seconds of silence, she had enough. \u201eAlright, no explanation then. Get out, both of you!\u201c </p><p>Before he could leave, you rushed towards Peter and embraced him in a hug. </p><p>\u201eThank you so much. I owe you\u201c, you whispered into his ear. \u201eYou know what? This party has been lame from the start, I\u2018ll go home with you\u201c</p><p>And as soon as those words left your mouth, you realized what it sounded like. Peter started blushing, as you tried to correct yourself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I mean like, you know, we\u2019re living on the same street and I thought that maybe we could walk there together. O-only if you want to, of course and - \u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, Y/N. Don\u2019t worry about it, I would actually love to walk home with you\u201d, he interrupted, giving you a warm smile and you had to admit, it made your heart flutter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s say goodbye and then we can get out of here\u201d, you said, excited to spend some time alone with him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The two of you were walking down the street, when you remembered Ned\u2019s words from earlier this morning. You were about to ask him why he was scared to meet you, but you changed your mind last second. It would make things awkward, so you just decided to prove him that you weren\u2019t someone to be afraid of.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Peter? I don\u2019t wanna go home yet, let\u2019s do something\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wanna do?\u201d, he looked at you with his big doe eyes, which <i>almost</i> made your heart melt.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to the Cherry Hill at Central Park? You can\u2019t go there during the day - too many couples that are <i>oh so in love</i>. But it\u2019s so much more romantic during the night\u201d</p><p>He looked at you, obviously startled by the things you just said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, it has the best fountain to swim in\u201d, you laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait, you want to go swimming in a fountain at Central Park? Is that what your usual Saturday Night looks like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean.. not <i>every S</i>aturday night<i>,</i>\u00a0and sometimes it\u2019s a Friday, but yeah, we do that occasionally\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled at your casual statement and to be honest, he has never been more excited to go for a late night swim in a dirty fountain.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Half an hour later, you arrived at the Cherry Hill. Since it was summer, the trees weren\u2019t blooming, but it was beautiful none the less. The lights illuminated the fountain and the space around it in a warm light and before you knew it, Peter lifted you up and threw you into the cold water.</p><p>\u201cI show you this place and this is how you thank me for it?!\u201d, you asked him in between laughter. You stood up, your wet clothes clinging to every inch of your body. As you were about to splash him, you noticed him staring.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEyes up here, please\u201d, you snapped your fingers into his face, causing him to turn bright red.\u00a0\u201cAaanyways, are you going to join me or what?\u201d</p><p>He nodded in response, quickly getting rid of his shirt and it hit you like a truck. When did Peter Parker get this hot?</p><p>\u201cEyes up here, please\u201d, he mocked you with a chuckle, earning an embarrassed smile from you as he joined you. You could see the excitement in his eyes. His beautiful, brown eyes. The ones you could get lost in every time they looked right through you.\u00a0</p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by a splash of water hitting your face and a hearty laughter from Peter.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you didn\u2019t. You know what this means, right?\u201d, you grinned at him.</p><p>And with that, the water battle had begun. The two of you ran in circles, splashing one another as much as you could, putting each others heads underwater and laughing like children.\u00a0</p><p>After a while, he managed to sit on top of you and you closed your eyes out of reflex, expecting to lose the battle by getting your head dived underwater, but he didn\u2019t move. You opened one eye to check what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? This is your chance. I\u2019m ready to lose\u201d, you giggled.</p><p>But he just looked at you, examining every inch of your face. Your wet skin glistened in the light of the street lamps and water drops sat on top of your long lashes. The stars reflected in your breathtaking Y/E/C eyes and for a moment he was convinced that they held the whole universe in them. Even though your hair was wet, it still framed your face in the most beautiful way and your well-formed, plump, rosy lips made him wonder how soft they would feel against his own. He brushed a strand of wet hair behind your ear and realized that he had without a doubt the most gorgeous girl in front of him.</p><p>\u201ePeter? Is everything o-\u201c, but he interrupted your question by kissing you softly. You were hesitant at first, but soon leaned into the kiss, causing him to smile against your lips. Peter\u2018s hand rested on the side of your face, his thumb brushing against your cheekbone, when the two of you got interrupted by his ring tone. </p><p>He reached into his backpack and pulled out his phone underneath a red and blue..sweater? </p><p>\u201eI\u2018m sorry, Y/N. I really need to answer, it\u2018s Mr. Stark\u201c</p><p>\u201eIt\u2018s 12:30, why does he call you in the middle of the night?\u201c</p><p>\u201eIt\u2018s probably something important\u201c, Peter answered. </p><p>He got up and out of the fountain, walking a few steps away so you couldn\u2018t hear what he was saying. You decided to get out of the cold water as well. After a few minutes, he walked back to you. </p><p>\u201eSo? Is it something more important than this?\u201c, you asked him. Peter looked at you for a moment before he answered. </p><p>\u201eI\u2018m so sorry, Y/N, but I need to go. Maybe I can explain this to you some other time\u201c</p><p>\u201eMaybe? So you\u2018re not sure yet if I\u2018m worth an explanation or not?\u201c, you asked disappointed. </p><p>\u201eNo, it\u2018s not what you think, but I-I just really need to go now. Listen, I\u2018m sorry, please don\u2018t be mad at me\u201c </p><p>He wanted to pull you in for a hug, but you shook your head and made a step backwards. The sight of you broke his heart, but this was probably the biggest chance in his life and he simply couldn\u2018t miss it. </p><p>He was sure you would understand, if only you knew. </p>",

I don\u2019t wanna go home yet, let\u2019s do something\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wanna do?\u201d, he looked at you with his big doe eyes, which <i>almost</i> made your heart melt.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to the Cherry Hill at Central Park? You can\u2019t go there during the day - too many couples that are <i>oh so in love</i>. But it\u2019s so much more romantic during the night\u201d</p><p>He looked at you, obviously startled by the things you just said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, it has the best fountain to swim in\u201d, you laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait, you want to go swimming in a fountain at Central Park? Is that what your usual Saturday Night looks like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean.. not <i>every S</i>aturday night<i>,</i>\u00a0and sometimes it\u2019s a Friday, but yeah, we do that occasionally\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled at your casual statement and to be honest, he has never been more excited to go for a late night swim in a dirty fountain.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Half an hour later, you arrived at the Cherry Hill. Since it was summer, the trees weren\u2019t blooming, but it was beautiful none the less. The lights illuminated the fountain and the space around it in a warm light and before you knew it, Peter lifted you up and threw you into the cold water.</p><p>\u201cI show you this place and this is how you thank me for it?!\u201d, you asked him in between laughter. You stood up, your wet clothes clinging to every inch of your body. As you were about to splash him, you noticed him staring.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEyes up here, please\u201d, you snapped your fingers into his face, causing him to turn bright red.\u00a0\u201cAaanyways, are you going to join me or what?\u201d</p><p>He nodded in response, quickly getting rid of his shirt and it hit you like a truck. When did Peter Parker get this hot?</p><p>\u201cEyes up here, please\u201d, he mocked you with a chuckle, earning an embarrassed smile from you as he joined you. You could see the excitement in his eyes. His beautiful, brown eyes. The ones you could get lost in every time they looked right through you.\u00a0</p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by a splash of water hitting your face and a hearty laughter from Peter.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you didn\u2019t. You know what this means, right?\u201d, you grinned at him.</p><p>And with that, the water battle had begun. The two of you ran in circles, splashing one another as much as you could, putting each others heads underwater and laughing like children.\u00a0</p><p>After a while, he managed to sit on top of you and you closed your eyes out of reflex, expecting to lose the battle by getting your head dived underwater, but he didn\u2019t move. You opened one eye to check what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? This is your chance. I\u2019m ready to lose\u201d, you giggled.</p><p>But he just looked at you, examining every inch of your face. Your wet skin glistened in the light of the street lamps and water drops sat on top of your long lashes. The stars reflected in your breathtaking Y/E/C eyes and for a moment he was convinced that they held the whole universe in them. Even though your hair was wet, it still framed your face in the most beautiful way and your well-formed, plump, rosy lips made him wonder how soft they would feel against his own. He brushed a strand of wet hair behind your ear and realized that he had without a doubt the most gorgeous girl in front of him.</p><p>\u201ePeter? Is everything o-\u201c, but he interrupted your question by kissing you softly. You were hesitant at first, but soon leaned into the kiss, causing him to smile against your lips. Peter\u2018s hand rested on the side of your face, his thumb brushing against your cheekbone, when the two of you got interrupted by his ring tone. </p><p>He reached into his backpack and pulled out his phone underneath a red and blue..sweater? </p><p>\u201eI\u2018m sorry, Y/N. I really need to answer, it\u2018s Mr. Stark\u201c</p><p>\u201eIt\u2018s 12:30, why does he call you in the middle of the night?\u201c</p><p>\u201eIt\u2018s probably something important\u201c, Peter answered. </p><p>He got up and out of the fountain, walking a few steps away so you couldn\u2018t hear what he was saying. You decided to get out of the cold water as well. After a few minutes, he walked back to you. </p><p>\u201eSo? Is it something more important than this?\u201c, you asked him. Peter looked at you for a moment before he answered. </p><p>\u201eI\u2018m so sorry, Y/N, but I need to go. Maybe I can explain this to you some other time\u201c</p><p>\u201eMaybe? So you\u2018re not sure yet if I\u2018m worth an explanation or not?\u201c, you asked disappointed. </p><p>\u201eNo, it\u2018s not what you think, but I-I just really need to go now. Listen, I\u2018m sorry, please don\u2018t be mad at me\u201c </p><p>He wanted to pull you in for a hug, but you shook your head and made a step backwards. The sight of you broke his heart, but this was probably the biggest chance in his life and he simply couldn\u2018t miss it. </p><p>He was sure you would understand, if only you knew. </p>",

He\u2019s like the long lost Avenger and literally EVERYWHERE on the News\u201c Ned said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s crazy. Spiderman, your friendly Neighborhood-Hero while all the other ones are protecting the world from alien invasions\u201d, you joked, earning a chuckle from Ned. </p><p>After a few minutes of eating in comfortable silence, Ned turned his head to you. </p><p>\u201eSo, what do you think of Peter?\u201c</p><p>\u201eApart from that weird goodbye yesterday, he\u2018s actually pretty fun. You might have found someone I\u2018m cool with, congratulations Ned\u201c </p><p>You saw your best friend grinning widely, clearly proud of himself. </p><p>\u201eHe was shitscared to meet you, because of your reputation and stuff. But I think he quickly realized that you\u2018re not half as bad as people make you out to be\u201c</p><p>\u201eOh wow, thank you for that. Very comforting\u201c, you said sarcastically. </p><p>\u201eYou know what I mean\u201c</p><p>\u201eSure. I have to go now, Tessa needs her morning cuddles\u201c, you said in a cold tone. </p><p>\u201eY/N, look, I\u2018m sorry. I know these rumours about you aren\u2018t true\u201c</p><p>\u201eI know that you and Michelle don\u2018t believe them, but that\u2018s about it. See, I\u2018m aware of the fact that I\u2018m not the most open-hearted person out there, but they make me look like a monster sometimes. I\u2018m not the cold bitch that they\u2018re always talking about\u201c</p><p>\u201eI know, Y/N\u201c, Ned pulled you in for one of his bear-hugs, \u201eTheir opinion doesn\u2018t matter, alright? If they actually took the time to get to know you, they would see what a beautiful, funny, intelligent and caring person you are. It takes a bit of time to earn your trust, but it\u2018s absolutely worth it, because I couldn\u2018t ask for a better friend than you\u201c</p><p>\u201eThank you, Ned. See you later\u201c</p><p>And with that, you went home to your dog Tessa.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><b>From: MJ</b></p><p><b>\u201eNed and Peter are going to this lame party at Liz\u2018s house, should we go too? Just to make sure they\u2018re being respectful to the ladies, of course\u201c</b></p><p>You chuckled at the text you\u2018ve just received. Typical MJ. </p><p><b>To: MJ</b></p><p><b>\u201eSure, I don\u2018t have other plans for later anyways, so we might as well pretend that we\u2018re enjoying ourselves at a house party.

You haven\u2018t seen the boys yet, so MJ and you decided to watch the current beerpong match. After a while of cheering and acting like you cared, you realized your cup was empty.  </p><p>\u201eI\u2018ll go get another drink. You good?\u201c you asked Michelle, who nodded in agreement. </p><p>You were about to enter the kitchen, as two arms snaked around your waist from behind. </p><p>\u201eHey pretty girl, wanna have some fun?\u201c, a deep, raspy voice whispered in your ear, sending shivers down your spine. One of his hands traveled down to your butt and squeezed it. In an instant you swatted his hand away and turned around to face him. </p><p>\u201eYou better get your hands off of me\u201c, you hissed, but he only chuckled and grabbed your wrists firmly. </p><p>\u201eOr what?\u201c, he asked you with a twisted smirk. </p><p>\u201eOr I\u2018ll punch that stupid smile off your face\u201c, another voice answered and you looked around to see who it was. </p><p>Ned was standing there in disbelief, processing the words that just came out of Peter\u2018s mouth. </p><p>\u201eDude, he\u2018s gonna crush you\u201c, Ned whispered to him. </p><p>\u201eMaybe, but he\u2018ll leave Y/N alone\u201c</p><p>The grip around your wrists loosened and the stranger walked up to Peter. </p><p>\u201eBrave of you, kiddo. Aren\u2018t you supposed to be in bed right now?\u201c </p><p>People were gathering around the two of them, some already filming on their phones, others chuckling at the previous comment. </p><p><i>Oh no. This is bad. </i></p><p>But to your surprise, Peter dodged the first punch coming towards him, causing the other guy to stumble past him into the crowd. It continued like this for a while - Peter just constantly dodging hits, because the other guy was drunk and clumsy and Peter too polite to actually hurt him, even though he knew he easily could.</p><p>In the meantime, MJ found Liz and told her about what was going on. She was clearly pissed when she found out that two guys were having a fight inside her living room. </p><p>\u201eWhat the hell is going on?\u201c, she screamed, causing them to stop in their tracks. After a few seconds of silence, she had enough. \u201eAlright, no explanation then. Get out, both of you!\u201c </p><p>Before he could leave, you rushed towards Peter and embraced him in a hug. </p><p>\u201eThank you so much. I owe you\u201c, you whispered into his ear. \u201eYou know what? This party has been lame from the start, I\u2018ll go home with you\u201c</p><p>And as soon as those words left your mouth, you realized what it sounded like. Peter started blushing, as you tried to correct yourself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I mean like, you know, we\u2019re living on the same street and I thought that maybe we could walk there together. O-only if you want to, of course and - \u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, Y/N. Don\u2019t worry about it, I would actually love to walk home with you\u201d, he interrupted, giving you a warm smile and you had to admit, it made your heart flutter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s say goodbye and then we can get out of here\u201d, you said, excited to spend some time alone with him.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The two of you were walking down the street, when you remembered Ned\u2019s words from earlier this morning. You were about to ask him why he was scared to meet you, but you changed your mind last second.

Spiderman, your friendly Neighborhood-Hero while all the other ones are protecting the world from alien invasions&rdquo;, you joked, earning a chuckle from Ned. </p><p>After a few minutes of eating in comfortable silence, Ned turned his head to you. </p><p>&bdquo;So, what do you think of Peter?&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;Apart from that weird goodbye yesterday, he&lsquo;s actually pretty fun. You might have found someone I&lsquo;m cool with, congratulations Ned&ldquo; </p><p>You saw your best friend grinning widely, clearly proud of himself. </p><p>&bdquo;He was shitscared to meet you, because of your reputation and stuff. But I think he quickly realized that you&lsquo;re not half as bad as people make you out to be&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;Oh wow, thank you for that. Very comforting&ldquo;, you said sarcastically. </p><p>&bdquo;You know what I mean&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;Sure. I have to go now, Tessa needs her morning cuddles&ldquo;, you said in a cold tone. </p><p>&bdquo;Y/N, look, I&lsquo;m sorry. I know these rumours about you aren&lsquo;t true&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;I know that you and Michelle don&lsquo;t believe them, but that&lsquo;s about it. See, I&lsquo;m aware of the fact that I&lsquo;m not the most open-hearted person out there, but they make me look like a monster sometimes. I&lsquo;m not the cold bitch that they&lsquo;re always talking about&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;I know, Y/N&ldquo;, Ned pulled you in for one of his bear-hugs, &bdquo;Their opinion doesn&lsquo;t matter, alright? If they actually took the time to get to know you, they would see what a beautiful, funny, intelligent and caring person you are. It takes a bit of time to earn your trust, but it&lsquo;s absolutely worth it, because I couldn&lsquo;t ask for a better friend than you&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;Thank you, Ned. See you later&ldquo;</p><p>And with that, you went home to your dog Tessa.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><b>From: MJ</b></p><p><b>&bdquo;Ned and Peter are going to this lame party at Liz&lsquo;s house, should we go too? Just to make sure they&lsquo;re being respectful to the ladies, of course&ldquo;</b></p><p>You chuckled at the text you&lsquo;ve just received. Typical MJ. </p><p><b>To: MJ</b></p><p><b>&bdquo;Sure, I don&lsquo;t have other plans for later anyways, so we might as well pretend that we&lsquo;re enjoying ourselves at a house party. My mom will be so proud&ldquo;</b></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Loud music was coming from every corner of the living room, while drunk people were dancing, playing drinking games or making out. You haven&lsquo;t seen the boys yet, so MJ and you decided to watch the current beerpong match. After a while of cheering and acting like you cared, you realized your cup was empty.  </p><p>&bdquo;I&lsquo;ll go get another drink. You good?&ldquo; you asked Michelle, who nodded in agreement. </p><p>You were about to enter the kitchen, as two arms snaked around your waist from behind. </p><p>&bdquo;Hey pretty girl, wanna have some fun?&ldquo;, a deep, raspy voice whispered in your ear, sending shivers down your spine. One of his hands traveled down to your butt and squeezed it. In an instant you swatted his hand away and turned around to face him. </p><p>&bdquo;You better get your hands off of me&ldquo;, you hissed, but he only chuckled and grabbed your wrists firmly. </p><p>&bdquo;Or what?&ldquo;, he asked you with a twisted smirk. </p><p>&bdquo;Or I&lsquo;ll punch that stupid smile off your face&ldquo;, another voice answered and you looked around to see who it was. </p><p>Ned was standing there in disbelief, processing the words that just came out of Peter&lsquo;s mouth. </p><p>&bdquo;Dude, he&lsquo;s gonna crush you&ldquo;, Ned whispered to him. </p><p>&bdquo;Maybe, but he&lsquo;ll leave Y/N alone&ldquo;</p><p>The grip around your wrists loosened and the stranger walked up to Peter. </p><p>&bdquo;Brave of you, kiddo. Aren&lsquo;t you supposed to be in bed right now?&ldquo; </p><p>People were gathering around the two of them, some already filming on their phones, others chuckling at the previous comment. </p><p><i>Oh no. This is bad. </i></p><p>But to your surprise, Peter dodged the first punch coming towards him, causing the other guy to stumble past him into the crowd. It continued like this for a while - Peter just constantly dodging hits, because the other guy was drunk and clumsy and Peter too polite to actually hurt him, even though he knew he easily could.</p><p>In the meantime, MJ found Liz and told her about what was going on. She was clearly pissed when she found out that two guys were having a fight inside her living room. </p><p>&bdquo;What the hell is going on?&ldquo;, she screamed, causing them to stop in their tracks. After a few seconds of silence, she had enough. &bdquo;Alright, no explanation then. Get out, both of you!&ldquo; </p><p>Before he could leave, you rushed towards Peter and embraced him in a hug. </p><p>&bdquo;Thank you so much. I owe you&ldquo;, you whispered into his ear. &bdquo;You know what? This party has been lame from the start, I&lsquo;ll go home with you&ldquo;</p><p>And as soon as those words left your mouth, you realized what it sounded like. Peter started blushing, as you tried to correct yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I mean like, you know, we&rsquo;re living on the same street and I thought that maybe we could walk there together. O-only if you want to, of course and - &rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know, Y/N. Don&rsquo;t worry about it, I would actually love to walk home with you&rdquo;, he interrupted, giving you a warm smile and you had to admit, it made your heart flutter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s say goodbye and then we can get out of here&rdquo;, you said, excited to spend some time alone with him.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The two of you were walking down the street, when you remembered Ned&rsquo;s words from earlier this morning. You were about to ask him why he was scared to meet you, but you changed your mind last second. It would make things awkward, so you just decided to prove him that you weren&rsquo;t someone to be afraid of.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what, Peter? I don&rsquo;t wanna go home yet, let&rsquo;s do something&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you wanna do?&rdquo;, he looked at you with his big doe eyes, which <i>almost</i> made your heart melt.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever been to the Cherry Hill at Central Park? You can&rsquo;t go there during the day - too many couples that are <i>oh so in love</i>. But it&rsquo;s so much more romantic during the night&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at you, obviously startled by the things you just said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kidding, it has the best fountain to swim in&rdquo;, you laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you want to go swimming in a fountain at Central Park? Is that what your usual Saturday Night looks like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I mean.. not <i>every S</i>aturday night<i>,</i>&nbsp;and sometimes it&rsquo;s a Friday, but yeah, we do that occasionally&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckled at your casual statement and to be honest, he has never been more excited to go for a late night swim in a dirty fountain.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Half an hour later, you arrived at the Cherry Hill. Since it was summer, the trees weren&rsquo;t blooming, but it was beautiful none the less. The lights illuminated the fountain and the space around it in a warm light and before you knew it, Peter lifted you up and threw you into the cold water.</p><p>&ldquo;I show you this place and this is how you thank me for it?!&rdquo;, you asked him in between laughter. You stood up, your wet clothes clinging to every inch of your body. As you were about to splash him, you noticed him staring.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Eyes up here, please&rdquo;, you snapped your fingers into his face, causing him to turn bright red.&nbsp;&ldquo;Aaanyways, are you going to join me or what?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded in response, quickly getting rid of his shirt and it hit you like a truck. When did Peter Parker get this hot?</p><p>&ldquo;Eyes up here, please&rdquo;, he mocked you with a chuckle, earning an embarrassed smile from you as he joined you. You could see the excitement in his eyes. His beautiful, brown eyes. The ones you could get lost in every time they looked right through you.&nbsp;</p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by a splash of water hitting your face and a hearty laughter from Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, you didn&rsquo;t. You know what this means, right?&rdquo;, you grinned at him.</p><p>And with that, the water battle had begun. The two of you ran in circles, splashing one another as much as you could, putting each others heads underwater and laughing like children.&nbsp;</p><p>After a while, he managed to sit on top of you and you closed your eyes out of reflex, expecting to lose the battle by getting your head dived underwater, but he didn&rsquo;t move. You opened one eye to check what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for? This is your chance. I&rsquo;m ready to lose&rdquo;, you giggled.</p><p>But he just looked at you, examining every inch of your face. Your wet skin glistened in the light of the street lamps and water drops sat on top of your long lashes. The stars reflected in your breathtaking Y/E/C eyes and for a moment he was convinced that they held the whole universe in them. Even though your hair was wet, it still framed your face in the most beautiful way and your well-formed, plump, rosy lips made him wonder how soft they would feel against his own. He brushed a strand of wet hair behind your ear and realized that he had without a doubt the most gorgeous girl in front of him.</p><p>&bdquo;Peter? Is everything o-&ldquo;, but he interrupted your question by kissing you softly. You were hesitant at first, but soon leaned into the kiss, causing him to smile against your lips. Peter&lsquo;s hand rested on the side of your face, his thumb brushing against your cheekbone, when the two of you got interrupted by his ring tone. </p><p>He reached into his backpack and pulled out his phone underneath a red and blue..sweater? </p><p>&bdquo;I&lsquo;m sorry, Y/N. I really need to answer, it&lsquo;s Mr. Stark&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;It&lsquo;s 12:30, why does he call you in the middle of the night?&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;It&lsquo;s probably something important&ldquo;, Peter answered. </p><p>He got up and out of the fountain, walking a few steps away so you couldn&lsquo;t hear what he was saying. You decided to get out of the cold water as well. After a few minutes, he walked back to you. </p><p>&bdquo;So? Is it something more important than this?&ldquo;, you asked him. Peter looked at you for a moment before he answered. </p><p>&bdquo;I&lsquo;m so sorry, Y/N, but I need to go. Maybe I can explain this to you some other time&ldquo;</p><p>&bdquo;Maybe? So you&lsquo;re not sure yet if I&lsquo;m worth an explanation or not?&ldquo;, you asked disappointed. </p><p>&bdquo;No, it&lsquo;s not what you think, but I-I just really need to go now. Listen, I&lsquo;m sorry, please don&lsquo;t be mad at me&ldquo; </p><p>He wanted to pull you in for a hug, but you shook your head and made a step backwards. The sight of you broke his heart, but this was probably the biggest chance in his life and he simply couldn&lsquo;t miss it. </p><p>He was sure you would understand, if only you knew. </p>",

With how things had been faring against her, it was inevitable that he would come to this conclusion, it was just easier said than done. Her being a notorious super villain, a dangerous alien, as well as an exiled princess from a world of Viking warriors, were only minor inconveniences compared to what would happen if he failed.

And the boy was beyond glad that the fourteen-year-old had decided to forgive him from keeping the Spider-Man secret from her for so long. The weeks full of silent treatment were practically unbearable considering most of the time it was only the two of them home. However, the time and energy Peyton put into being mad at Peter turned into time and energy going into research about the superhero world and everything that comes with it.</p><p>Dinners that used to be filled with conversation about homework and other bits of trivial conversation were now filled with conversations about Super serum, mutant genes, a rousing debate on which superheroes have the fastest healing time (Peter was very insistent that he was top three.), and whatever else Peyton had read about in her day.</p><p>Peter was thrilled that his sister took an interest and excitement in what he and the rest of the Avengers could do, and even found out that Peyton could often give Peter information that he didn&rsquo;t know. However, one occasion Peter wished that he could have kept the Spider-Man secret from his younger sister a little longer. Not only so he could keep her and her innocence safer. But also because the conversations about the superhero world could get a little annoying, but Peter soldiered through them by telling himself three things. One, he found most of the conversations somewhat interesting. Two, Peyton loved learning about his world and he couldn&rsquo;t be the one to ruin it for her. Three, what younger sibling isn&rsquo;t going to be annoying sometimes.</p><p>\u201cPeyton, you didn&rsquo;t see a werewolf,\u201d Peter laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d She challenged pointing her fork towards Peter with a smirk on her face.</p><p>\u201cBecause they don&rsquo;t exist. Even if they did, one wouldn&rsquo;t walk around in broad daylight,\u201d He explained.</p><p>\u201cWait, what do you mean they don&rsquo;t exist?\u201d She exclaimed.</p><p>Peter opened his mouth to explain, but he was cut off. <br/>\u201cHarry Potter has werewolves. Twilight has werewolves. I get thrown into my own supernatural world and yet werewolves aren&rsquo;t even a thing? How is that fair? At least tell me there&rsquo;s a wolf-man or something,\u201d She questioned as she looked to Peter with what seemed like pleading eyes. Almost astonished that the man she saw earlier wasn&rsquo;t a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cThere&rsquo;s a wolverine? And a wolfsbane? She the most like a werewolf from what I understand\u201d Peter told his sister hoping those answers would satisfy his seemingly disappointed sister.</p><p>He watched as she debated his answers for a minute before seemingly accepting that one day she might get to meet a type of werewolf.</p><p>\u201cWell, that man I saw today was extremely hairy. I bet you would have thought he was a werewolf too\u201d She spoke with a certainty in her voice that made Peter laugh, and become reminded about how much he loved his sister company.</p><p>Peter was used to these types of conversations because it was seemingly constant anymore that Peyton&rsquo;s overactive imagination made her think she saw some form of super-something when she was out and about in public and couldn&rsquo;t help but enjoy his sisters&rsquo; wild explanations of what she had seen that day.</p><p>\u201cWell, I&rsquo;m sorry your walk home from school today was so disappointing\u201d He chuckled as he picked up his plate and washed it off in the sink.</p><p>\u201cCan&rsquo;t you stay a little longer Pete? I&rsquo;m not even done eating,\u201d Peyton asked with a sadness in her voice, turning around in her chair to look at Peter in the eyes.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, imagining his sister alone, eating dinner at the table. And felt for a minute like he was neglecting her. But he quickly shook it off saying that Mondays were his busiest day and he would be there for her the rest of the week.</p><p>\u201cI have to patrol you know that. Plus you should have spent more time eating and less time trying to convince me you saw a werewolf walking in Midtown.\u201dHe joked before he came over and kissed Peyton on the head, something he always did before leaving for patrol.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Yeah,\u201d She sighed. As she watched her brother strip down into the super suit that he hadn&rsquo;t taken off from his earlier patrol, and climb into the window frame, ready to jump out.</p><p>\u201cI have a field trip tomorrow remember,\u201d He reminded the girl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got it, Stay Safe, please Peter.

Peter easily laid you down on the bed and scooted close. You smiled at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Pete?&rdquo; You asked as he rested his head on your chest.  </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, uh.. I just want to be close to you. I love you. You know that, right?&rdquo; Peter said needily.  He kissed you firmly with his hand gently cupping your face. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened today?&rdquo; You asked as you pulled away. Peter didn&rsquo;t remove his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I just realized how scary life can be and I&rsquo;m lucky to have you. Kiss me?&rdquo; He asked. You felt him press against your body again. </p><p>&ldquo;You have something going on,&rdquo; you muttered as you reached in his boxers and felt his erection. He hissed as you slowly pumped him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so hard. Do you need me to take care of you?&rdquo; Peter nodded quickly. </p><p>You pushed him on his back and pulled his shorts down. He was so hard he was leaking precum.  You pulled your underwear and shorts off and straddled him. He tried to push his hips up but you stopped him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you. Okay? Don&rsquo;t move, baby,&rdquo; you said peeling your shirt off as you hovered over his dick. Peter gasped as you grabbed him and rubbed the tip on your clit. He whined as you rubbed your wetness just on the tip. Finally you sank down on his cock.  </p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit. Yeah,&rdquo; he groaned.  You placed your hands on his chest as you sat up. You began bouncing slowly. Peter closed his eyes and leaned his head back. You began swirling your hips and it rubbed your clit just right. </p><p>Peter whimpered because it was amazing but not enough. &ldquo;Can you go faster?&rdquo; He begged. His hips jumping slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Be patient. I&rsquo;m going to get mine and then yours okay, baby boy?&rdquo; You asked reaching up to pinch your nipple.

His cock twitched and he panted in his effort. He reached up and grasped both of your nipples roughly. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh baby boy, I&rsquo;m gonna-gonna cum,&rdquo; you yelled before clenching his cock as you came. He groaned and grabbed your hips roughly and twitched one final time before finding his release.  You lay on his chest, you both panting.</p><p>Finally you tried to get up but Peter held your waist. You looked at him confused. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to stay this close. For a while? Okay?&rdquo; He asked.  You nodded and he pulled the blanket over you both and wrapped his arms around you tightly.

He let go on the ground and looked up for his enemy. Gone. </p><p>Peter breathed heavily in the mask as his heart pounded. He almost died.  God, what would Aunt May say if he died?  Mr Stark? You? </p><p>You had just asked him to be more careful the week before when he showed up bloody and bruised.  Peter felt guilty as he gingerly swung his way to your apartment. You were waiting on him to do some calculus homework. </p><p>Peter swung on your fire escape and slid through the empty window. You sat in your computer chair, your chest and head leaning on a textbook.  Your eyes were closed and you breathed slowly in sleep. Peter looked at the clock. He was 2 hours late. </p><p>Peter wanted to touch you. He wanted to know you both were safe. He decided to simply carry you to bed. He took off his suit. When he went to scoop you up, your eyes opened and you jumped slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Its me, baby,&rdquo; Peter said softly. You relaxed but stayed awake. Peter easily laid you down on the bed and scooted close. You smiled at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Pete?&rdquo; You asked as he rested his head on your chest.  </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, uh.. I just want to be close to you. I love you. You know that, right?&rdquo; Peter said needily.  He kissed you firmly with his hand gently cupping your face. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened today?&rdquo; You asked as you pulled away. Peter didn&rsquo;t remove his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I just realized how scary life can be and I&rsquo;m lucky to have you. Kiss me?&rdquo; He asked. You felt him press against your body again. </p><p>&ldquo;You have something going on,&rdquo; you muttered as you reached in his boxers and felt his erection. He hissed as you slowly pumped him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so hard. Do you need me to take care of you?&rdquo; Peter nodded quickly. </p><p>You pushed him on his back and pulled his shorts down. He was so hard he was leaking precum.  You pulled your underwear and shorts off and straddled him. He tried to push his hips up but you stopped him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you. Okay? Don&rsquo;t move, baby,&rdquo; you said peeling your shirt off as you hovered over his dick. Peter gasped as you grabbed him and rubbed the tip on your clit. He whined as you rubbed your wetness just on the tip. Finally you sank down on his cock.  </p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit. Yeah,&rdquo; he groaned.  You placed your hands on his chest as you sat up. You began bouncing slowly. Peter closed his eyes and leaned his head back. You began swirling your hips and it rubbed your clit just right. </p><p>Peter whimpered because it was amazing but not enough. &ldquo;Can you go faster?&rdquo; He begged. His hips jumping slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Be patient. I&rsquo;m going to get mine and then yours okay, baby boy?&rdquo; You asked reaching up to pinch your nipple. Peter nodded and watched you ride him. Your hips swirling and your tits bouncing was an amazing view. Your head thrown back as you panted. </p><p>Peter pushed his legs together and his hips up and you felt him even deeper. You couldn&rsquo;t handle it anymore and you began circling your clit with you hand as you bounced quickly. Peter tightly gripped your hips as he felt himself close. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cum. Me first, okay?&rdquo; You ordered. You knew he liked to be told what to do. He gasped out a yes and scrunched his eyes closed and you felt his thighs shake and he held off. Your own orgasm fast approaching. </p><p>He whimpered when your core clenched on him as you got close. You were moaning loudly as you bounced furiously. Peter could barely bare not cumming.  His cock twitched and he panted in his effort. He reached up and grasped both of your nipples roughly. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh baby boy, I&rsquo;m gonna-gonna cum,&rdquo; you yelled before clenching his cock as you came. He groaned and grabbed your hips roughly and twitched one final time before finding his release.  You lay on his chest, you both panting.</p><p>Finally you tried to get up but Peter held your waist. You looked at him confused. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to stay this close. For a while? Okay?&rdquo; He asked.  You nodded and he pulled the blanket over you both and wrapped his arms around you tightly.  You laid you head on his chest and before you knew it, you both were asleep.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Tag list:</b> Permanent tag list </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">@meg-holland @smexylemony @flashgunashton @calum-hoodwinked-me @laucontrerasv @courtneychicken @beeloverqueen <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBEiOqYvWBqvE5TfMu8UDpg\">@imahoformarvel</a> </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Friday Night Smut</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">@notobsessed-justobservant  @jiminiecricket @nerdraging4point0 </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Let me know if you want to be added or removed from permanent or Friday Night Smut tag list. </p></p>",
