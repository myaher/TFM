I saw someone on reddit speculate about it since Sansa is currently v much higher than her sister in role and title, and that would even the playing field. It could even work in book canon, with them playing the roles for either a young Rickon or Bran (although if it was  Bran, Sansa's role would obviously be more Lady Stark than Lord Stark -esque).",

First of all, they\u2019re all super close in age; there\u2019s no need for them to assume power when Bran is nearly as old, and has actual experienced people around him to help. Second, neither girl has the experience that Bran has to be able to take on those roles over him. Bran has actually dealt with the politics of Winterfell firsthand as acting lord. Nothing Sansa or Arya can do will trump that experience or knowledge. Third of all, Jon is (or will be, if we\u2019re talking the books) alive, and he has extensive experience in leadership and northern-based politics. Sticking Arya and Sansa in these roles (at least right now) makes zero sense when their  remaining brothers have a combined political career that has dealt with battle, food rations, delegation, execution, sacrifice, negotiations, etc. </p>",
