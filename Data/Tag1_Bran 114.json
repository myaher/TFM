It\u2019s the beginning of Bran returning to his Starkness. Pretty sure when he says Jon belongs at home, he means it. Jon won\u2019t believe it and then Sansa will reassure him in the Godswood </p><p>11. So Dany? Well she\u2019s kind of just there. She\u2019s not riding on a dragon. Smart but that doesn\u2019t mean much WHEN THERE ARE TWO FIRE BREATHING DRAGONS FLYING OVER WINTERFELL. THE NORTH IS SCARED AND HAS TOO MANY THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT AND NOW THEY GOTTA WORRY ABOUT THESE HUGE ASS LIZARDS FUCK THAT and once again emphasis on the smallfolk\u2019s reaction to the dragons is too familiar. Hopefully they only die by white walkers and not by dragon fire. Or they don\u2019t die at all. </p><p>12. Jon is the center of the trailer and I can\u2019t believe he is that beautiful. Jon baby you\u2019re doing amazing sweetie. Please keep playing the game. All will be well in the end. </p><p>13. Sansa is stunning. Most beautiful queen on the block. She is stunting on these hoes. Another post I saw and I\u2019ll tag it when I see it again but it\u2019s on how Sansa clearly saw the Dothraki, Unsullied, and dragons and still have Dany the death glare.

                "content": "<p><h1>Had to turn my brightness hella up to see that trailer</h1><h2>How do I turn up the brightness on my tv before the season starts? </h2><p>1. Kidnap plot is definitely real as many have noticed. </p><p>2. The first scenes of Arya running through the halls, she&rsquo;s probably in King&rsquo;s Landing helping Jon save Sansa. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the crypts but it could be. I&rsquo;m offering an alternative. </p><p>3. That VO of Jon&rsquo;s last line about the enemy and how it cuts to Cersei drinking wine, a deterrent. We thought and Jon thinks the true enemy is the Night King or Cersei. Nah fam, it&rsquo;s Dark!Dany. </p><p>4. Where is Ghost? I don&rsquo;t want no damn dragons. I want Ghost. Or is he looking for Nymeria and Co.?</p><p>5. Gendry is alive thank God and making Dragonglass weapons. I need my Gendrya reunion. </p><p>6. I didn&rsquo;t see Davos in the trailer am I blind? </p><p>7. Sansa &ldquo;looking out&rdquo; after Jon and Daenerys scene wow poetic cinema love triangle angst tears I&rsquo;m not ready for it </p><p>8. Sansa is saying something during her close up. I don&rsquo;t know what it is but if ain&rsquo;t &ldquo;Jon please&rdquo; then I don&rsquo;t want it </p><p>9. Jaime redemption arc fully achieved. This man is dying or living as a hero. His page from Westeros&rsquo; Greatest Knights will be filled.  </p><p>10. So before I thought that Jon and Bran would be alone talking about his parentage. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure Jon is there and Sam opens the door for him, hence Sam taking that look towards the back left. Bran is speaking to Jon and thankfully RoboBran will be gone. It&rsquo;s the beginning of Bran returning to his Starkness. Pretty sure when he says Jon belongs at home, he means it. Jon won&rsquo;t believe it and then Sansa will reassure him in the Godswood </p><p>11. So Dany? Well she&rsquo;s kind of just there. She&rsquo;s not riding on a dragon. Smart but that doesn&rsquo;t mean much WHEN THERE ARE TWO FIRE BREATHING DRAGONS FLYING OVER WINTERFELL. THE NORTH IS SCARED AND HAS TOO MANY THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT AND NOW THEY GOTTA WORRY ABOUT THESE HUGE ASS LIZARDS FUCK THAT and once again emphasis on the smallfolk&rsquo;s reaction to the dragons is too familiar. Hopefully they only die by white walkers and not by dragon fire. Or they don&rsquo;t die at all. </p><p>12. Jon is the center of the trailer and I can&rsquo;t believe he is that beautiful. Jon baby you&rsquo;re doing amazing sweetie. Please keep playing the game. All will be well in the end. </p><p>13. Sansa is stunning. Most beautiful queen on the block. She is stunting on these hoes.
