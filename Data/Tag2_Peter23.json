A white blur shot past your eyes and you looked up to see Spider-man suspended above the fire escape, his hand stretched out as a long string connected his wrist to your ukulele. He pulled the string towards him as he landed gently in front of you. \u2018Oh I\u2019m so sorry I made you jump and drop this, I was just up on your roof and I heard you playing and I wanted to see and I hope that\u2019s okay, I really wasn\u2019t trying to scare you or anything and yeah\u2026. here you go,\u2019 he mumbled all at once, while rubbing the back of his neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Oh no, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m so clumsy, it\u2019s not you,\u2019 you said, giving him a smile. You couldn\u2019t believe it was really him, a real-life superhero who was actually talking to you and was so close that you could reach out and touch him.\u00a0\u2018Yeah so um, my Uncle Ben really liked that song and it just made me think about him, that\u2019s why I was listening, I promise I wasn\u2019t being creepy or anything\u2019. He was endearingly bashful, and you wanted to keep talking to him.\u00a0You thought quickly, took a step closer to him and said \u2018It\u2019s alright, I know you weren\u2019t being creepy. Do you play?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh no, I\u2019m not very good with music,\u2019 he said, his masked eyes narrowed and you knew he was smiling underneath. \u2018Do you want to learn a little bit?\u2019 you looked up at him, offering him your ukulele with a smile and trying to sound encouraging. \u2018It\u2019s really easy, you\u2019ll see!\u2019 He grabbed the small instrument from you, turning it over and holding it gingerly. He held it away from his chest, supporting it at the base.\u00a0\u2018Like this?\u2019 \u2018No, you need it hold it closer. You hold its weight with your right arm but make sure you can still move your wrist to strum it.\u2019\u00a0Spider-man held your ukulele pressed against his chest, the right way.\u00a0\u2018Right, now you put your fingers there like this,\u2019 you said, trying to mimic the shape for the E minor chord in mid-air.\u00a0\u2018Can I move your fingers?\u2019 you looked up at him, hoping that he would let you show him.\u00a0\u2018Yeah, please,\u2019 he laughed a little,\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing\u2019. You stepped closer, then used your right hand to press his index, middle and ring finger against the bottom three strings.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s called E minor, and you play it as you sing the first bit of the chorus, like a river \u2019. He looked down as he strummed the strings gently. \u2018That\u2019s great,\u2019 you said to encourage him, \u2018and the next one is a little easier, you just do this.\u2019 You moved his fingers again, this time forming the chord for B7.\u00a0\u2018Strum it when you sing the next word.\u2019\u00a0He fumbled a little as he played the previous chord and then the next one, repeating the two. You sang the first two lines quietly, to help him know when to change chords. \u2018See! You can totally play if you learn! Maybe i\u2019ll catch you playing that Spider-Pig song,\u2019 you joked. It worked and he laughed, and you felt a little thrill because of it.\u00a0</p><p>He held the ukulele out to you,\u00a0\u2018thanks, uh, what\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u2018Y/N,\u2019 you replied softly, looking at his masked face. &lsquo;Thanks, y/n.\u2019 \u2018So, I know you have to keep a secret identity and everything, and that\u2019s why you wear this and everything,\u2019 you said, gesturing to him,\u00a0\u2018but can I know your first name? Feels kinda weird just calling you Spider-man?\u2019 you rubbed your arm a little awkwardly. You were sure that he would say he couldn\u2019t risk it, or maybe he\u2019d just say goodbye and leave now.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll tell you if you pinky-promise not to tell anyone else\u2019. He held out his little finger and waved it in front of your face.</p><p>\u2018I do, I pinky-promise I won\u2019t tell\u2019. You grabbed his little finger with yours, squeezing it slightly.\u00a0\u2018Okay. My real name is Peter,\u2019 he said, letting go.\u00a0\u2018Well, it\u2019s nice meeting you Peter\u2019.\u00a0\u2018I have to go now, but maybe you can teach me the rest of that song some other time,\u2019 said Peter, sounding hopeful. You smiled up at him,\u00a0\u2018Yes of course, you know where to find me\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Okay then, I might drop by sometime\u2026\u2019 Peter jumped up on the edge of the fire escape, slinging his webbing across the alley.\u00a0\u2018See you around, Peter\u2019. You watched him as he jumped off, and made his way to the main street, wondering if he would indeed stop by. Either way, it wasn\u2019t every day that you could say you taught a superhero how to play the ukulele. You smiled to yourself as you clambered back in quietly, propping your ukulele up and flopping down on your bed.\u00a0</p>",

The cold night air raised goose bumps on your skin, but you welcomed it, breathing it in.</p><p><br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You slowly pulled your ukulele out the window before you shut it quietly. Leaning back against the fire escape stairs, you pressed the instrument against you, strumming it softly. You plucked a few notes, humming to yourself.</p><p>You were just playing the last chord of Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love when you heard a clang above you, which made you drop your instrument in surprise. A white blur shot past your eyes and you looked up to see Spider-man suspended above the fire escape, his hand stretched out as a long string connected his wrist to your ukulele. He pulled the string towards him as he landed gently in front of you. \u2018Oh I\u2019m so sorry I made you jump and drop this, I was just up on your roof and I heard you playing and I wanted to see and I hope that\u2019s okay, I really wasn\u2019t trying to scare you or anything and yeah\u2026. here you go,\u2019 he mumbled all at once, while rubbing the back of his neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Oh no, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m so clumsy, it\u2019s not you,\u2019 you said, giving him a smile. You couldn\u2019t believe it was really him, a real-life superhero who was actually talking to you and was so close that you could reach out and touch him.\u00a0\u2018Yeah so um, my Uncle Ben really liked that song and it just made me think about him, that\u2019s why I was listening, I promise I wasn\u2019t being creepy or anything\u2019. He was endearingly bashful, and you wanted to keep talking to him.\u00a0You thought quickly, took a step closer to him and said \u2018It\u2019s alright, I know you weren\u2019t being creepy. Do you play?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh no, I\u2019m not very good with music,\u2019 he said, his masked eyes narrowed and you knew he was smiling underneath. \u2018Do you want to learn a little bit?\u2019 you looked up at him, offering him your ukulele with a smile and trying to sound encouraging. \u2018It\u2019s really easy, you\u2019ll see!\u2019 He grabbed the small instrument from you, turning it over and holding it gingerly. He held it away from his chest, supporting it at the base.\u00a0\u2018Like this?\u2019 \u2018No, you need it hold it closer. You hold its weight with your right arm but make sure you can still move your wrist to strum it.\u2019\u00a0Spider-man held your ukulele pressed against his chest, the right way.\u00a0\u2018Right, now you put your fingers there like this,\u2019 you said, trying to mimic the shape for the E minor chord in mid-air.\u00a0\u2018Can I move your fingers?\u2019 you looked up at him, hoping that he would let you show him.\u00a0\u2018Yeah, please,\u2019 he laughed a little,\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing\u2019. You stepped closer, then used your right hand to press his index, middle and ring finger against the bottom three strings.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s called E minor, and you play it as you sing the first bit of the chorus, like a river \u2019. He looked down as he strummed the strings gently. \u2018That\u2019s great,\u2019 you said to encourage him, \u2018and the next one is a little easier, you just do this.\u2019 You moved his fingers again, this time forming the chord for B7.\u00a0\u2018Strum it when you sing the next word.\u2019\u00a0He fumbled a little as he played the previous chord and then the next one, repeating the two. You sang the first two lines quietly, to help him know when to change chords. \u2018See! You can totally play if you learn! Maybe i\u2019ll catch you playing that Spider-Pig song,\u2019 you joked. It worked and he laughed, and you felt a little thrill because of it.\u00a0</p><p>He held the ukulele out to you,\u00a0\u2018thanks, uh, what\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u2018Y/N,\u2019 you replied softly, looking at his masked face. \u2018Thanks, y/n.\u2019 \u2018So, I know you have to keep a secret identity and everything, and that\u2019s why you wear this and everything,\u2019 you said, gesturing to him,\u00a0\u2018but can I know your first name? Feels kinda weird just calling you Spider-man?\u2019 you rubbed your arm a little awkwardly. You were sure that he would say he couldn\u2019t risk it, or maybe he\u2019d just say goodbye and leave now.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll tell you if you pinky-promise not to tell anyone else\u2019. He held out his little finger and waved it in front of your face.</p><p>\u2018I do, I pinky-promise I won\u2019t tell\u2019. You grabbed his little finger with yours, squeezing it slightly.\u00a0\u2018Okay. My real name is Peter,\u2019 he said, letting go.\u00a0\u2018Well, it\u2019s nice meeting you Peter\u2019.\u00a0\u2018I have to go now, but maybe you can teach me the rest of that song some other time,\u2019 said Peter, sounding hopeful. You smiled up at him,\u00a0\u2018Yes of course, you know where to find me\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Okay then, I might drop by sometime\u2026\u2019 Peter jumped up on the edge of the fire escape, slinging his webbing across the alley.\u00a0\u2018See you around, Peter\u2019. You watched him as he jumped off, and made his way to the main street, wondering if he would indeed stop by. Either way, it wasn\u2019t every day that you could say you taught a superhero how to play the ukulele. You smiled to yourself as you clambered back in quietly, propping your ukulele up and flopping down on your bed.\u00a0</p>",

There are a million reasons why, (or maybe there\u2019s just one big reason). Both of them are dealing with the aftermath of tony starks death and not healthy ways. In an effort to get back to normal, they both go on the school trip to Europe, only to be thrust right back into the hero world. Someone needs to be the next Iron Man, but are either of them really ready for that? </i></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cEveryone wants a happy ending, right?

Once it was fully together, she stood up, and played around with it for a couple of minutes. She grew and compressed edges, poked at the hologram and moved it around in circles. She wasn\u2019t doing it for any type of research, or actually contributing to the design at all. The truth was that she was stuck. </p><p>After the couple minutes of playing with it were over, (Y/N) sat down again in the chair and let out a long frustrated sigh, as quietly as she could so no one in the house could hear her. \u201cThis has to work.\u201d She said, biting down on the candy so hard she bit her tongue, \u201cI don\u2019t have any other options.\u201d She thought for another minute and almost screamed out of frustration, \u201cThis has to work.\u201d She threw her hands in the air, dramatically and one of the wrenches from the nearby workspace flew into her palm without warning. </p><p>She dropped it as soon as she could, and shook her hand witch glowed purple for a second before flickering out. \u201cOuch.\u201d She rubbed her hand before looking back at the model. \u201cKeep it together Stark, your going to figure this out. You have to figure it out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFRIDAY tell me about the theory of the multiverse.\u201d </p><p>(Y/N) tapped her fingers on the edge of the table as she listened. \u201cAccording to MIT physicist Max Tegmark, \u2018Our entire universe may be just one element \u2014 one atom, as it were \u2014 in an infinite ensemble; a cosmic archipelago.\u2019 Which means that we could exist on one plane, next to a variety of different universes where dinosaurs still exist, or the Earth never formed at all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut it can be smaller changes to right? Like for example Thanos never came to Earth, never found it in the first place?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPull up the model labeled time machine please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, Ms. Stark.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>(Y/N) stood up again and looked over the model her father had made months ago, right before the time heist as he had called it. He thought it was a time machine, but through her research, she\u2019d found that he was wrong, they were all wrong. \u201cFriday pull up the Banner audio file, the one I stared, and my research pages all side by side with the model.\u201d </p><p>She\u2019d done this multiple times the past few days, since she\u2019d hit a wall on what to do with all the information she\u2019d gathered. It had all started two days after her father&rsquo;s funeral, when Uncle Steve had gathered all the stones, and got ready to return them all back to their respective timelines. She\u2019d been watching from afar, mostly because she knew that one of them was going to give her the pity face if they knew she was there. But bruce had said something about the \u201cancient one\u201d telling him that if they didn\u2019t return the stones then that reality would be in trouble and branch off. </p><p>(Y/N) had been in the woods that day to steal the stones. Looking back she knew the plan had been concocted only in grief and that in practice it wouldn\u2019t have worked at all. Sure, she could\u2019ve easily gotten the stones by pulling the briefcase out of caps hand with her powers and then making a run for it. But, she didn\u2019t have a gauntlet to put them on, and there were heros lingering everywhere and it would only be a matter of time before someone caught her. Good thing she learned something else that day that would help her more than a few infinity stones ever could. </p><p>\u201cSo in theory-\u201d She mused, \u201cI could use this device to create a portal, and use the secondary device to find a universe that has what I need, and poof, we have liftoff.\u201d She smiled but it quickly faded once she realized that it wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. \u201cYeah, and y\u2019know build said machine, and use it without anyone finding out. And who knows what kind of hell is going to break loose once I do it.\u201d She paused, \u201cFRIDAY has anyone else tried to build tried to build a similar machine to the model?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne second.\u201d The table hummed as the AI searched through data. \u201cFour months ago, the details and blueprints of the model were given to an american company for research purposes concerning the quantum realm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark industries?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFisk industries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour kidding.\u201d (Y/N) sat up, \u201cYou have got to be kidding me. FRIDAY why wouldn\u2019t the information be given over to our own in house researchers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ms. Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is proprietary technology, created by Tony Stark himself, and your telling me that they sold it off to Wilson Fisk, this could be extremely dangerous, who\u2019s to say someone doesn\u2019t just use this to go back and get the infinity stones?\u201d (Y/N) said. \u201cWhat about Hank Pym?

If I can make my model, then I\u2019ll be able to get it to the one in Amsterdam-and this could work.\u201d She stood up in surprise and put both hands on the table smiling over the model in front of her. \u201cThis could totally work. It could work.

(Y/N) turned in surprise to find that the door to the garage was open and the outline of someone glistened in the moonlight. \u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d It was Peter. Crap. </p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She paused, moving in front of the hologram so that he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cFRIDAY turn it off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d He walked into the garage and tried to look past her at the table. \u201cFRIDAY pull it up again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Parker.\u201d The hologram pulled up again and glowed behind (Y/N). <br/><br/></p><p>\u201cNope!\u201d She shouted, getting onto the table, and laying down across it in the most nonchalant way possible. \u201cPeter! Whatcha doing here? What&rsquo;s up bro? How\u2019s life been dude-bro?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing. FRIDAY turn it off, and put it under passcode lock.\u201d She turned back to Peter. \u201cNothing, absolutely nothing. What are you even doing here? I thought you left.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was getting late and I didn\u2019t want to drive back, so Pepper said I could just stay the night.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh lovely, nice, good for you. The guest room is super classy, very nice decor, very homey. What are you doing out here? In the garage? Looking for ghosts?

Hiding things? That\u2019s crazy. When have you ever known me to hide things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time. It\u2019s what you do.\u201d He replied, coldly, narrowing his eyes at her. \u201cLook if you won\u2019t tell me, then I\u2019m just going to go tell Pepper that something is going on in here and I guess she\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d He turned and walked out of the garage and into the night. </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d (Y/N) shouted. And the door slammed in Peters face suddenly, the door knob locking itself due to her powers. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Pepper. Look it\u2019s nothing Peter, I\u2019m just looking at stuff my dad was working on, old projects. Okay?\u201d He gave her a suspicious look. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, Pete. I haven\u2019t been able to in a while, and this helps.\u201d She wasn\u2019t exactly lying about that, she hadn\u2019t been able to get a \u00a0good night&rsquo;s sleep in the last six months. \u201cSo don\u2019t tell her please? She\u2019s gonna get all worried and then send me back to therapy, or get me meds or something.\u201d </p><p>Peter thought it over, turned around to face the door so that she couldn&rsquo;t see him. As much as he was mad at her, and he really was, he still cared. He cared enough to be worried about her, and how she was coping with everything and what she was really doing. But he knew that getting Pepper involved would just make the whole thing so much worse, so he told himself that they were going on a trip with each other in two days and he would be to keep an eye on her for the whole time. </p><p>\u201cFine.

He thought it was a time machine, but through her research, she\u2019d found that he was wrong, they were all wrong. \u201cFriday pull up the Banner audio file, the one I stared, and my research pages all side by side with the model.\u201d </p><p>She\u2019d done this multiple times the past few days, since she\u2019d hit a wall on what to do with all the information she\u2019d gathered. It had all started two days after her father\u2019s funeral, when Uncle Steve had gathered all the stones, and got ready to return them all back to their respective timelines. She\u2019d been watching from afar, mostly because she knew that one of them was going to give her the pity face if they knew she was there. But bruce had said something about the \u201cancient one\u201d telling him that if they didn\u2019t return the stones then that reality would be in trouble and branch off. </p><p>(Y/N) had been in the woods that day to steal the stones. Looking back she knew the plan had been concocted only in grief and that in practice it wouldn\u2019t have worked at all. Sure, she could\u2019ve easily gotten the stones by pulling the briefcase out of caps hand with her powers and then making a run for it. But, she didn\u2019t have a gauntlet to put them on, and there were heros lingering everywhere and it would only be a matter of time before someone caught her. Good thing she learned something else that day that would help her more than a few infinity stones ever could. </p><p>\u201cSo in theory-\u201d She mused, \u201cI could use this device to create a portal, and use the secondary device to find a universe that has what I need, and poof, we have liftoff.\u201d She smiled but it quickly faded once she realized that it wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. \u201cYeah, and y\u2019know build said machine, and use it without anyone finding out. And who knows what kind of hell is going to break loose once I do it.\u201d She paused, \u201cFRIDAY has anyone else tried to build tried to build a similar machine to the model?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne second.\u201d The table hummed as the AI searched through data. \u201cFour months ago, the details and blueprints of the model were given to an american company for research purposes concerning the quantum realm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark industries?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFisk industries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour kidding.\u201d (Y/N) sat up, \u201cYou have got to be kidding me.

Did he sign off on giving over the pym particles and suits to contribute to this \u2018research\u2019?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, the agreement states that the researchers are bound to Non disclosure agreements outside of the company heads and scientific officers, and that they are only allowed to experiment with the machine itself, they can\u2019t send anyone through time using it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou mean through dimensions, or universes.\u201d (Y/N) threw her hands in the air, \u201cThis is crazy.

Once it was fully together, she stood up, and played around with it for a couple of minutes. She grew and compressed edges, poked at the hologram and moved it around in circles.

It had all started two days after her father\u2019s funeral, when Uncle Steve had gathered all the stones, and got ready to return them all back to their respective timelines. She\u2019d been watching from afar, mostly because she knew that one of them was going to give her the pity face if they knew she was there. But bruce had said something about the \u201cancient one\u201d telling him that if they didn\u2019t return the stones then that reality would be in trouble and branch off. </p><p>(Y/N) had been in the woods that day to steal the stones. Looking back she knew the plan had been concocted only in grief and that in practice it wouldn\u2019t have worked at all. Sure, she could\u2019ve easily gotten the stones by pulling the briefcase out of caps hand with her powers and then making a run for it. But, she didn\u2019t have a gauntlet to put them on, and there were heros lingering everywhere and it would only be a matter of time before someone caught her. Good thing she learned something else that day that would help her more than a few infinity stones ever could. </p><p>\u201cSo in theory-\u201d She mused, \u201cI could use this device to create a portal, and use the secondary device to find a universe that has what I need, and poof, we have liftoff.\u201d She smiled but it quickly faded once she realized that it wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. \u201cYeah, and y\u2019know build said machine, and use it without anyone finding out. And who knows what kind of hell is going to break loose once I do it.\u201d She paused, \u201cFRIDAY has anyone else tried to build tried to build a similar machine to the model?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne second.\u201d The table hummed as the AI searched through data. \u201cFour months ago, the details and blueprints of the model were given to an american company for research purposes concerning the quantum realm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark industries?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFisk industries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour kidding.\u201d (Y/N) sat up, \u201cYou have got to be kidding me. FRIDAY why wouldn\u2019t the information be given over to our own in house researchers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ms. Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is proprietary technology, created by Tony Stark himself, and your telling me that they sold it off to Wilson Fisk, this could be extremely dangerous, who\u2019s to say someone doesn\u2019t just use this to go back and get the infinity stones?\u201d (Y/N) said. \u201cWhat about Hank Pym? Did he sign off on giving over the pym particles and suits to contribute to this \u2018research\u2019?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, the agreement states that the researchers are bound to Non disclosure agreements outside of the company heads and scientific officers, and that they are only allowed to experiment with the machine itself, they can\u2019t send anyone through time using it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou mean through dimensions, or universes.\u201d (Y/N) threw her hands in the air, \u201cThis is crazy. Who signed off on this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMs. Potts, and the construction of the device was supervised by Mr. Scott Lang.\u201d </p><p>\u201cConstruction? Why didn\u2019t they use the one that they used to return the stones?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDr. Banner destroyed that one as soon as the returning of the stones was completed, with the understanding that it wasn\u2019t needed because no was was going to use it again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell he thought wrong apparently.\u201d She leaned back into the chair and twirled around a screw in the air. \u201cFRIDAY pull up the documents you quoted earlier, the agreement between Stark industries and Fisk industries.\u201d (Y/N) peared over the documents for what felt like forever before standing up and pacing around the table. \u201cFRIDAY is the machine done?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d The AI replied. \u201cMr. Lang left the site three days ago, and confirmation was sent to Ms. Potts Yesterday. I believe it is fully operational.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d She sighed and sat back in the chair. \u201cHow did she not tell me about this? Why didn\u2019t she say anything? Holy crap. FRIDAY where is the machine?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAmsterdam.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait what? Why would it be in Amsterdam? Fisk industries has its headquarters in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a document that says something about avoiding taxes and American regulators.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that makes sense.\u201d She sighed before her eyes lit up with an idea. \u201cWait for a second, I\u2019m going to Europe in 48 hours. If I can make my model, then I\u2019ll be able to get it to the one in Amsterdam-and this could work.\u201d She stood up in surprise and put both hands on the table smiling over the model in front of her. \u201cThis could totally work. It could work. FRIDAY keep the time machine model up and pull up the Dimensional tracker next to it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne minute.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is so happening.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Another voice asked. (Y/N) turned in surprise to find that the door to the garage was open and the outline of someone glistened in the moonlight. \u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d It was Peter. Crap. </p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She paused, moving in front of the hologram so that he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cFRIDAY turn it off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d He walked into the garage and tried to look past her at the table. \u201cFRIDAY pull it up again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Parker.\u201d The hologram pulled up again and glowed behind (Y/N). <br><br></p><p>\u201cNope!\u201d She shouted, getting onto the table, and laying down across it in the most nonchalant way possible. \u201cPeter! Whatcha doing here? What\u2019s up bro? How\u2019s life been dude-bro?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNothing. FRIDAY turn it off, and put it under passcode lock.\u201d She turned back to Peter. \u201cNothing, absolutely nothing. What are you even doing here? I thought you left.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was getting late and I didn\u2019t want to drive back, so Pepper said I could just stay the night.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh lovely, nice, good for you. The guest room is super classy, very nice decor, very homey. What are you doing out here? In the garage? Looking for ghosts? Because I know that there\u2019s one at the end of the dock but you have to like jump into the water to see it-\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know your hiding something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Me? Hiding things? That\u2019s crazy. When have you ever known me to hide things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time. It\u2019s what you do.\u201d He replied, coldly, narrowing his eyes at her. \u201cLook if you won\u2019t tell me, then I\u2019m just going to go tell Pepper that something is going on in here and I guess she\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d He turned and walked out of the garage and into the night. </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d (Y/N) shouted. And the door slammed in Peters face suddenly, the door knob locking itself due to her powers. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Pepper. Look it\u2019s nothing Peter, I\u2019m just looking at stuff my dad was working on, old projects. Okay?\u201d He gave her a suspicious look. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, Pete. I haven\u2019t been able to in a while, and this helps.\u201d She wasn\u2019t exactly lying about that, she hadn\u2019t been able to get a \u00a0good night\u2019s sleep in the last six months. \u201cSo don\u2019t tell her please? She\u2019s gonna get all worried and then send me back to therapy, or get me meds or something.\u201d </p><p>Peter thought it over, turned around to face the door so that she couldn\u2019t see him. As much as he was mad at her, and he really was, he still cared. He cared enough to be worried about her, and how she was coping with everything and what she was really doing. But he knew that getting Pepper involved would just make the whole thing so much worse, so he told himself that they were going on a trip with each other in two days and he would be to keep an eye on her for the whole time. </p><p>\u201cFine.

Good thing she learned something else that day that would help her more than a few infinity stones ever could. </p><p>&ldquo;So in theory-&rdquo; She mused, &ldquo;I could use this device to create a portal, and use the secondary device to find a universe that has what I need, and poof, we have liftoff.&rdquo; She smiled but it quickly faded once she realized that it wasn&rsquo;t going to be that simple. &ldquo;Yeah, and y&rsquo;know build said machine, and use it without anyone finding out. And who knows what kind of hell is going to break loose once I do it.&rdquo; She paused, &ldquo;FRIDAY has anyone else tried to build tried to build a similar machine to the model?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One second.&rdquo; The table hummed as the AI searched through data. &ldquo;Four months ago, the details and blueprints of the model were given to an american company for research purposes concerning the quantum realm.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stark industries?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fisk industries.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your kidding.&rdquo; (Y/N) sat up, &ldquo;You have got to be kidding me. FRIDAY why wouldn&rsquo;t the information be given over to our own in house researchers?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ms. Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This is proprietary technology, created by Tony Stark himself, and your telling me that they sold it off to Wilson Fisk, this could be extremely dangerous, who&rsquo;s to say someone doesn&rsquo;t just use this to go back and get the infinity stones?&rdquo; (Y/N) said. &ldquo;What about Hank Pym? Did he sign off on giving over the pym particles and suits to contribute to this &lsquo;research&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, the agreement states that the researchers are bound to Non disclosure agreements outside of the company heads and scientific officers, and that they are only allowed to experiment with the machine itself, they can&rsquo;t send anyone through time using it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You mean through dimensions, or universes.&rdquo; (Y/N) threw her hands in the air, &ldquo;This is crazy. Who signed off on this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Potts, and the construction of the device was supervised by Mr. Scott Lang.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Construction? Why didn&rsquo;t they use the one that they used to return the stones?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dr. Banner destroyed that one as soon as the returning of the stones was completed, with the understanding that it wasn&rsquo;t needed because no was was going to use it again.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well he thought wrong apparently.&rdquo; She leaned back into the chair and twirled around a screw in the air. &ldquo;FRIDAY pull up the documents you quoted earlier, the agreement between Stark industries and Fisk industries.&rdquo; (Y/N) peared over the documents for what felt like forever before standing up and pacing around the table. &ldquo;FRIDAY is the machine done?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; The AI replied. &ldquo;Mr. Lang left the site three days ago, and confirmation was sent to Ms. Potts Yesterday. I believe it is fully operational.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god.&rdquo; She sighed and sat back in the chair. &ldquo;How did she not tell me about this? Why didn&rsquo;t she say anything? Holy crap. FRIDAY where is the machine?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Amsterdam.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait what? Why would it be in Amsterdam? Fisk industries has its headquarters in New York.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a document that says something about avoiding taxes and American regulators.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that makes sense.&rdquo; She sighed before her eyes lit up with an idea. &ldquo;Wait for a second, I&rsquo;m going to Europe in 48 hours. If I can make my model, then I&rsquo;ll be able to get it to the one in Amsterdam-and this could work.&rdquo; She stood up in surprise and put both hands on the table smiling over the model in front of her. &ldquo;This could totally work. It could work. FRIDAY keep the time machine model up and pull up the Dimensional tracker next to it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One minute.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This is so happening.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Another voice asked. (Y/N) turned in surprise to find that the door to the garage was open and the outline of someone glistened in the moonlight. &ldquo;What are you doing in here?&rdquo; It was Peter. Crap. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; She paused, moving in front of the hologram so that he couldn&rsquo;t see. &ldquo;FRIDAY turn it off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, wait.&rdquo; He walked into the garage and tried to look past her at the table. &ldquo;FRIDAY pull it up again.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Parker.&rdquo; The hologram pulled up again and glowed behind (Y/N). <br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; She shouted, getting onto the table, and laying down across it in the most nonchalant way possible. &ldquo;Peter! Whatcha doing here? What&rsquo;s up bro? How&rsquo;s life been dude-bro?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What are you hiding?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. FRIDAY turn it off, and put it under passcode lock.&rdquo; She turned back to Peter. &ldquo;Nothing, absolutely nothing. What are you even doing here? I thought you left.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was getting late and I didn&rsquo;t want to drive back, so Pepper said I could just stay the night.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh lovely, nice, good for you. The guest room is super classy, very nice decor, very homey. What are you doing out here? In the garage? Looking for ghosts? Because I know that there&rsquo;s one at the end of the dock but you have to like jump into the water to see it-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know your hiding something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Me? Hiding things? That&rsquo;s crazy. When have you ever known me to hide things?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the time. It&rsquo;s what you do.&rdquo; He replied, coldly, narrowing his eyes at her. &ldquo;Look if you won&rsquo;t tell me, then I&rsquo;m just going to go tell Pepper that something is going on in here and I guess she&rsquo;ll figure it out.&rdquo; He turned and walked out of the garage and into the night. </p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; (Y/N) shouted. And the door slammed in Peters face suddenly, the door knob locking itself due to her powers. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Pepper. Look it&rsquo;s nothing Peter, I&rsquo;m just looking at stuff my dad was working on, old projects. Okay?&rdquo; He gave her a suspicious look. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep, Pete. I haven&rsquo;t been able to in a while, and this helps.&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t exactly lying about that, she hadn&rsquo;t been able to get a &nbsp;good night&rsquo;s sleep in the last six months. &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t tell her please? She&rsquo;s gonna get all worried and then send me back to therapy, or get me meds or something.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter thought it over, turned around to face the door so that she couldn&rsquo;t see him. As much as he was mad at her, and he really was, he still cared. He cared enough to be worried about her, and how she was coping with everything and what she was really doing. But he knew that getting Pepper involved would just make the whole thing so much worse, so he told himself that they were going on a trip with each other in two days and he would be to keep an eye on her for the whole time. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine. I won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo; </p><p>taglist:</p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUQyyZjq1cC-uQ15CXbbruQ\" target=\"_blank\">@bands-and-shietz</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfXnO3mTScVBeWjtpiVTjyw\" target=\"_blank\">@yourbiggestspiderfan</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlLYT6HyeG22n-BNauk9A6A\" target=\"_blank\">@hey-its-grey</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh0MqKngu9JsVZfOSe2-Kyw\" target=\"_blank\">@sarahkatexoxo</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwgsP5lB4aGR3JLHde9Xvkg\" target=\"_blank\">@saturn-aka-six</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7pOPCRiqMBS6BHthIWLPWA\" target=\"_blank\">@sspider-parker</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9zQIOI6S7yMbj4_AGQz3g\" target=\"_blank\">@tomzfrog</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnAAqvh8LwQt0dd8rzNfOFw\" target=\"_blank\">@spideyboyficrecs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwyLjijCvZDPsnyCr4ix69Q\" target=\"_blank\">@missmulti</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2w5StmaIj0ZIphOpgJG5pA\" target=\"_blank\">@nourdev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQB_BKCUyRfEDs8P9IG9WAw\" target=\"_blank\">@aestheticallymarauderss</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-NJH4jRBVgFUCthPZ5bRNg\" target=\"_blank\">@editsbyjenny</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbVSON8BvLriCXW8kpiHZcw\" target=\"_blank\">@illmissyou3000</a></p></p>",

There are a million reasons why, (or maybe there&rsquo;s just one big reason). Both of them are dealing with the aftermath of tony starks death and not healthy ways. In an effort to get back to normal, they both go on the school trip to Europe, only to be thrust right back into the hero world. Someone needs to be the next Iron Man, but are either of them really ready for that? </i></p>\n<blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Everyone wants a happy ending, right?

Once it was fully together, she stood up, and played around with it for a couple of minutes. She grew and compressed edges, poked at the hologram and moved it around in circles. She wasn&rsquo;t doing it for any type of research, or actually contributing to the design at all. The truth was that she was stuck. </p>\n<p>After the couple minutes of playing with it were over, (Y/N) sat down again in the chair and let out a long frustrated sigh, as quietly as she could so no one in the house could hear her. &ldquo;This has to work.&rdquo; She said, biting down on the candy so hard she bit her tongue, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any other options.&rdquo; She thought for another minute and almost screamed out of frustration, &ldquo;This has to work.&rdquo; She threw her hands in the air, dramatically and one of the wrenches from the nearby workspace flew into her palm without warning. </p>\n<p>She dropped it as soon as she could, and shook her hand witch glowed purple for a second before flickering out. &ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo; She rubbed her hand before looking back at the model. &ldquo;Keep it together Stark, your going to figure this out. You have to figure it out.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;FRIDAY tell me about the theory of the multiverse.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>(Y/N) tapped her fingers on the edge of the table as she listened. &ldquo;According to MIT physicist Max Tegmark, &lsquo;Our entire universe may be just one element &mdash; one atom, as it were &mdash; in an infinite ensemble; a cosmic archipelago.&rsquo; Which means that we could exist on one plane, next to a variety of different universes where dinosaurs still exist, or the Earth never formed at all.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;But it can be smaller changes to right? Like for example Thanos never came to Earth, never found it in the first place?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pull up the model labeled time machine please?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ms. Stark.&rdquo; </p>\n</p>",

The nerve grafts\ndone by doctor Strange are holding and it seems to be time to move on to the\narm scarring. She reports that he is alert, conscious and reasonably fine, but\nin discomfort due to skin rawness.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;OK. Anything else? Did&hellip; did Peter need something? Request anything we should drop off\nthere?&rdquo;<br/>\nA beat.<br/>\nThat meant AI wanted to stress something specific.<br/>\n&ldquo;Peter did not set his search history to private,&rdquo; Friday reported.\n&ldquo;The queries he had tried yesterday were very limited in scope,\nhowever.&rdquo;<br/>\nHe nodded slowly.<br/>\n&ldquo;First eight requests were to the National Database, in search of his\nclassmates. One of them had unfortunately been lost to a car crash directly\nafter the Decimation.&rdquo;<br/>\nHe tapped his lip. He had had his hand in creation of the National Database,\nwhere people registered centrally the missing or the dead after the Snap and\nthen, again, marked themselves as alive once Bruce had returned everyone he\ncould. It was a mostly useful and effective service, despite certain - understandable\n- pushback from communities that felt their privacy would have been infringed\non&hellip; He would have to put Pepper on it when they had time, help to rebuild the\nwhole thing to make it more inclusive, less prone to manipulation and more\naccessible&hellip; Peter. Peter could have some ideas. Kids always saw these things\nfrom another angle. Put Peter and Pep on this, definitely. It would give Peter\nstuff to do, both socially and design-wise. He could probably get<br/>\nHe rubbed his hands and made a note to the effect.<br/>\n&ldquo;This definitely sounds like him. Anything else?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Well, the next three queries had been requests for details of his\nauthorisation. To quote &lsquo;what did he mean by full access, Friday&rsquo;. I have\nprovided the high level summary of what kind of information he can now make use\nof. He had since requested an overview of some chosen pieces of documentation\nand asked me to take several notes and to send text messages to two of his\nclassmates, informing them in general terms of his current state. They had responded\nwith enthusiasm, as it seems their class has been rather&hellip; affected by the\ndeaths directly after the Decimation.&rdquo;<br/>\nTony stood up and walked over to the window, trying to rein in the variety of\nideas that nagged him. One, he had to choose one thing. One specific&hellip;<br/>\n&ldquo;How is his school doing? Actually, in general, what is the situation of\nthe schools?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;City, state, country, world-wide?&rdquo;<br/>\nHe frowned and tapped the glass in frustration.<br/>\n&ldquo;Start with city and then widen the analysis. Financial data, attendance,\ntechnical issues, staffing issues, organisational problems, resources&hellip; Ah,\nand estimate the students potential on the job market.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;OK. This may take some time, as not all records are readily available\nonline.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Send enquiries. Hire a researcher or two to go physically to places you\ncan&rsquo;t reach.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Sure, boss.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;And what is it that you plan to do with this data, hm?&rdquo; Pepper\nleaned on his back, reaching around him to hand him a mug of coffee.\n&ldquo;Because as the CEO I would have to sign off on any significant cash\ntransfers and other detail like this.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;I think we can help a few schools around the neighbourhood without\naffecting our bottom line too much.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;A few, yes, but how many do you want to help, finally?&rdquo;<br/>\nHe huffed.<br/>\n&ldquo;As many as need it. Which is way too many, of course. I&rsquo;d have to devise\nsome kind of rating system - but then, which aspects should win? Should I help\nkids with the most potential, or ones that nobody else is going to actually\nbother with? Like Peter and his friends, for example - even though they are in\na technically oriented high school, it seems \nto be woefully underfunded. By the way, have you seen their results? I\nmean, I had a peek at what that girl does - what&rsquo;s her name, Friday?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Michelle, boss. Goes by 'MJ&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Michelle, exactly. What she writes about the government, well, better not\nto go into that, but her software design is truly inspired. She also seems to\nbe the most level-headed of the whole class&hellip; Peter&rsquo;s friend, Ned? Some other\nkids in their computer lab group? Prime candidates to create something\nseriously helpful, something that could change the future&hellip; Considering we\nhave about a billion less people than before the Decimation, what with the\nlosses around both Snaps - all three of them, I suppose - we have to find the way\nto utilise the resources&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Shhh&hellip;&rdquo; she caught his face in both hands. &ldquo;Tony, stop. You\ncan&rsquo;t save the whole world. Not right now, not this second. Focus. Step by\nstep. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to do, really? What can you\ndo?&rdquo;<br/>\nHe took a shuddering breath.<br/>\n&ldquo;I want for people to stop dying because of stupid reasons. And they still\ndo. Everywhere. There are shortages of everything, from food to power to\nstinking bandaids. We did it already once, after the Decimation. We should be\nable to do it again. It&rsquo;s just suddenly become so much harder to convince\npeople that we have to keep working together&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;You are not seriously suggesting it was somehow better the previous\ntime?&rdquo;<br/>\nHe shrugged and pulled her closer.<br/>\n&ldquo;It was definitely easier to talk to the third of the planet&rsquo;s politicians\nthan to the whole bunch who came back from the nothingness and have problems\nadjusting to the fact that the world had moved on when they were not there.\nSome had even dared to claim that no time had passed at all and it&rsquo;s all a hoax\nto oust them from their offices&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\nPepper shivered. Yeah. They had both been witnesses to the great blow-up\nbetween the two available American presidents. With one of them screaming\nobscenities about a conspiracy and the other trying to defend the validity of\nher having been elected. The fact that the two had been rivals for the position\nyears earlier did not help a bit.<br/>\n&ldquo;There are entire countries suddenly changing hands again and there is\nnobody on the global scale who could decide which way is more just or proper.\nNot to mention religious wars&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\nReligious wars. Oh, yeah. They had found out - the hard way - that nothing made\nreligious nutjobs more active than an apocalypse they had lived through (the\nsecond place was taken by an apocalypse they had missed due to being broken up\ninto dust in the process of it having happened) and the two of them had already\nseen their names being listed among the saints, demons, antichrists and even as\nThe Prime Reasons the Whole Thing Had Happened. Not everyone specified which\nThing they meant. It gave them such a nice flexibility of options.<br/>\nThere were also many, many movements were very much interested in the identity\nof the person who had snapped the unearthly aggressors out of existence. Some\nwished to put him above their altars, some to put him on their altars - as a\nhuman sacrifice, no less. Some wanted for the Miracle Worker to come and smite\ntheir local enemies. Some wanted the Red Demon to be damned to the fires of\nhell for not allowing the Purification Army (yes, there were idiots out there\nwho claimed Thanos to be the Will of God (God of their choice)) to progress and\ncleanse the Earth. In short, the world had become much more dangerous, twisted\nand plain crazy since the Decimation had been reversed. And very risky for\nanyone who had been identified as having taken part in The Final Standoff<br/>\nAs Bruce had managed to create his public image as Smart Hulk in the\n&ldquo;Meanwhile&rdquo; period, now he had to isolate himself from the general\npopulation in order to avoid all the craziness, as, unfortunately, he had been\nidentified as the person who performed the Return snap and so was a highly\nsought-after kind-of-celebrity (with an unhealthy amount of haters as usually\nattached to that kind of situation). Spending time in the New York Sanctum was,\nit turned out, his preferred choice, and Strange allowed it without questioning\nBruce&rsquo;s reasons, while applying all possible treatments to Hulk&rsquo;s very\ntreatment-resistant injuries.</p><p>Peter being the second person to wield the\nGauntlet and still nameless to the public, his security was of utmost priority,\nuntil they could get him back into a working shape and allow him to return to\nschool as if he had been an innocent victim of the aftermath of the Return,\nlike so many others. Having been anonymous all the time and successfully\ncovering his tracks with his friends, he was, for the time being, quite safe.<br/>\nHopefully.<br/>\nUnless someone worked out that his disappearance and then reappearance and then\nthe wound patterns&hellip;<br/>\n&ldquo;A call from Peter Parker, boss,&rdquo; Friday chimed softly.<br/>\n&ldquo;Accept!&rdquo;<br/>\nThere was a soft sound on the other side of the line.<br/>\n&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Mr Stark,&rdquo; the boy sighed. &ldquo;Just&hellip; I&rsquo;m so sorry. I just wanted\nto check&hellip; are you sure you wanted to give me all that&hellip; all that\naccess&hellip;?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered immediately. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you work with me\nand keep you away from the vital documents.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;B-but, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s so much, so much of everything&hellip; I mean, Friday is\nnow only making summaries for me, but I have so many ideas - all this, all this\ntech, and I&hellip; Are you sure?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he strode towards the window, smiling at Pepper, who\nsat on one of the tables, watching him. 'Peter,&rsquo; he mouthed and she nodded.\n&ldquo;Kid, I know what I&rsquo;m doing. This is my playground, my sandbox. Well,\nofficially it belongs to Pepper, but she usually lets me take the best toys\nhome. I&rsquo;m sure she won&rsquo;t begrudge anything my new junior engineer may wish to\nutilise, as long as it&rsquo;s in reasonable manner.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;So, no blowing things up?&rdquo; Peter joked weakly.<br/>\n&ldquo;Not unless I&rsquo;m there to watch.&rdquo;<br/>\nPepper hid her face in her hands, peeking at him from between her fingers.<br/>\n&ldquo;I think&hellip; I think I have an idea, sir,&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s voice still\nwasn&rsquo;t all that strong. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&hellip; I&rsquo;ve asked Friday to make notes of it, if\nyou want to see it. Well. Them. More than one&hellip; idea.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he paused. &ldquo;Are you OK with it? Me checking your notes?\nThat&rsquo;s your stuff. Your intellectual property.&rdquo;<br/>\nPeter sighed.<br/>\n&ldquo;Yeah. Anything that is in my notes. I can put some official&hellip; note on\nthem, if it helps. Friday, what&hellip; do I put on the notes to make sure&hellip; Mr\nStark can make use of them?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Peter, are you feeling OK?&rdquo; he noticed he was straining to hear the\nboy&rsquo;s words more and more. &ldquo;Friday, status report, now!&rdquo;<br/>\nA weak &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, sir,&rdquo; mixed with, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in distress, boss,\ncalling doctor Strange and princess Shuri,&rdquo; in his ear and he leaned his\nforehead on the wall, waiting.<br/>\nWaiting.<br/>\nSteps, voice.<br/>\nShuri.<br/>\nBerating Peter for something, unclear.<br/>\nThe link being moved.<br/>\n&ldquo;Stark?&rdquo; sharp voice of the young scientist came through loudly.<br/>\n&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m sorry, he started sounding as if there was something wrong,\nFriday&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Very good call. I must thank you. He is feverish, over 102. I&rsquo;m\nsuspecting an infection from one of the burns after all. We are taking him for\na check and then back to isolation room. I&rsquo;ll update you soon, when we have new\nresults.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he managed to whisper before she clicked the connection\noff.<br/>\nHe slid slowly down the wall, resting his forehead on his knees.<br/>\nA cool, narrow hand came to rest on his neck, rubbing it in slow circles.<br/>\n&ldquo;He is ill, Pep,&rdquo; he whispered as she sat down next to him. &ldquo;He\ncalled me, he was feverish, and I hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything wrong. I just thought\nhe was tired from the treatment.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Shuri is taking care of him, isn&rsquo;t she? You spoke to her? She has a\ngeneral physician there, I know.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Yes, and Friday also called Strange in. I just&hellip; I just wish I could do\nmore. I wish there was something else I was good for - apart from blowing\nthings up and letting kids like him die on my watch.&rdquo;<br/>\nShe smacked him slightly on the back of his head.<br/>\n&ldquo;Peter isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;And this wallowing in\nguilt is starting to get old. Now, get a grip and try to think, what can you do\nto help him. What does he need? What does Shuri need? Is there something\nStephen may think he&rsquo;d need but did not think to ask you, for whatever reason?\nSomething Peter may need?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Peter asked me to read his files,&rdquo; he said, mechanically. &ldquo;He\nwanted me to see something, some idea that he had using the existing tech.\nFriday, send a message to doctor Strange, request feedback and ask if there are\nany resources he may need for Peter. And send Peter&rsquo;s note files to my\ndesktop.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Done, boss,&rdquo; the AI answered immediately. &ldquo;Princess Shuri says\nthe fever is most probably the reaction to yesterday treatment and the fact\nthat Peter managed to twist one of his IVs by accident and became slightly\ndehydrated. He is still having problems with body temperature, as his\nhypothalamus and pituitary gland are both not regrown enough.&rdquo;<br/>\nPepper frowned.<br/>\n&ldquo;Tony, should we be even hearing this? I mean, he is an adult and we are\nnot his family, it should be his Aunt May, not us&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Shuri isn&rsquo;t actually a doctor,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;At least not\nin the strict sense of a registered medical professional in US. And Strange&hellip;\nhe plays by his own rules. I&rsquo;m sure they are sending the same reports to May,\nbut&hellip;&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Strange was there with us, on that awful planet.\nI think he saw it all happening anyway, long before it did happen. He applies\nsomehow&hellip; a different metric to Peter. And, anyway, Pep, what&rsquo;s the sense in\nbeing an arrogant, self-centered dick if I can&rsquo;t make use of it from time to\ntime and check on my favourite assistant? By the way, I will have to create a\nproper job description for him, I suppose&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\nA kiss was pressed to his temple.<br/>\n&ldquo;Let him get better first. Also, creating job descriptions is more of a\nCEO thing. At least in case of my company.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;And what am I supposed to be in said company?&rdquo; he asked testily,\npushing himself to his feet and walking over to the table.<br/>\n&ldquo;The name, the pretty face and the head of the independent research and\ndesign department,&rdquo; she clicked something on her tablet. &ldquo;Voila. The\ndepartment, as of now, consists of two employees, one of which is one Anthony\nEdward Stark and, assisting him, on a position of junior engineer, Peter\nBenjamin Parker. There, done. He has a proper salary and is now officially on a\npaid sick leave due to a work-related accident. Retroactively on payroll since\nthe Return. Congratulations, department head.&rdquo;<br/>\nHe shook his head slightly at her frivolity, but pulled her closer as he called\nthe files Friday had deposited on his main desktop and started paging through\nthem. Some notes were very highlevel, but three files went deeper into details.\nPeter must have&hellip;<br/>\n&ldquo;He overexerted himself telling Friday all of this and that&rsquo;s why he is\nsick now,&rdquo; Pepper commented with regret. &ldquo;The least we can do right\nnow is to have a look at it. Scroll on. This is fascinating.&rdquo;<br/>\nA description of skin graft implant based on Peter&rsquo;s own web structure and some\nhigh-tensile material he had dug up from Friday&rsquo;s banks. Tony hadn&rsquo;t even known\nthey had a patent for something like that.<br/>\nA piece of software - scraps of code, some of it only in comments and general\npseudocode to show the logic, some of it in Python - that was supposed to\ncalculate - he frowned - ah. The fluctuations of demographics, but what did he\nuse from the databanks&hellip;? Tony frowned as he saw some beginnings of machine\ncode matching one of the big calculation datacenters. Ah. Using the National\nDatabase to predict population growth and pinpoint the next baby booms. What\ndid they teach in schools these days?<br/>\n&ldquo;Very useful in any industry,&rdquo; Pepper breathed. &ldquo;If you can make\nthis work, companies will be killing themselves to get this data.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;What&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Imagine you&rsquo;re a car seat producer. Or you manufacture powdered milk. Or\nhave a school. Or <i>anything</i> else that\ninvolves children. Clothes&hellip;!&rdquo;<br/><i>Indeed</i>. He squeezed her hand\nslightly.</p><p>And to think that there were people out there\nwho would have discounted Pepper Potts as nothing more than a pretty face and a\npair of lovely legs. Well, he had used to. But he had grown smarter since&hellip;!<br/>\nHe clicked the half-code, half-ramble document closed.</p><p>The last one was seemingly rather&hellip; common. One\npage of short, terse sentences, a description of a not-so-novel usage of the\nenergy storage unit Stark Industries had prototyped barely a month before\nReturn and had not yet implemented on a larger scale. It delineated the\npotential application of the unit for light, long-distance vehicles, with the\naddition of solar panels to recharge the whole installation from. Tony frowned\nat the document, trying to understand what the catch would be, which element\nwould be in any way innovative or groundbreaking, as he had started to expect\nfrom Peter (the boy had invented the correct composition for his webbing at\nfifteen&hellip;!), but it seemed entirely&hellip; unexceptionable.<br/>\nUntil he scrolled down to the description of the other installed equipment -\nstill all taken from elements now produced by Stark Industries - and saw the\nvehicle for what it was. A self sustained survival capsule. There were modules\nfor water reclamation, storage for condensed food (SI brand, too), waste\ndisposal and air refreshing. Everything economically put in, the capsule almost\nlike a tiny spaceship but destined for wandering on the surface of a planet.</p><p>&ldquo;A Life Pod,&rdquo; Pepper marked the note\nwith her caption. &ldquo;Web Skin Graft and Demographic Fluctuations. Friday,\nmark them as internal, family grade. Include Peter in the family authorisation\ngroup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s already in it, Pep,&rdquo; Tony\ninformed her softly and saw her eyebrows rise, just a smidgen.<br/>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot of work,&rdquo; she stretched the display to show all three\nmain documents and additional pieces that Friday had visualised as post-it\nnotes all around them. &ldquo;He must have been up all night, silly\nboy&hellip;!&rdquo;</p><p>And all of this based solely on listening to the\nAI feeding him nearly random choice of data and him dictating the observations\nhe had theorised on in his mind. A true exercise in thought experiment. And the\ncode! He had to dictate the code&hellip;!<br/>\n&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been very interested in medicine before,&rdquo; he frowned at\nthe display. &ldquo;His regen factor makes him rather wary of normal\ndoctors.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been stuck in there for weeks now, even if unconscious. He might\nhave heard them talking about it often enough. Maybe something filtered in when\nhe was in the coma. They say people hear a lot when they are like this, in\nfact.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;A message from Stephen Strange, boss.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Read it, Friday.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;'I need someone to tell that boy to stop trying so hard, or I will break\nhis scrawny neck. Other than that, there are several pieces of diagnostic\nequipment we could use and Shuri hadn&rsquo;t had time to procure. List attached.&rsquo;\nand there is the list, boss.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Find if we have anything from the file in our storages, get it delivered\nto the Embassy. Anything else, order, barter for or steal. Just get it\ndone.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Boss, a message from Peter Parker.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Read it!&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;'I&rsquo;m feeling better now. Sorry to worry you, Mr Stark. I&rsquo;ll try to be\nless trouble in the future.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>\nHe swore, trying to rein in his temper.<br/>\n&ldquo;We have to do something with this, Pepper.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;With this what? And what do you mean?&rdquo;<br/>\nHe turned her and enveloped her in an all-encompassing hug.<br/>\n&ldquo;This all. All this shit that happened around us in the last few weeks.\nThat kid. I mean - he says he is sorry he is sick&hellip;! Did I ever give him a\nreason to think I&rsquo;d be mad if he was less than perfect? Yes, I expected stuff\nfrom him, I still will. But I&rsquo;m not expecting him to be super-superhuman! At\nthis point, I&rsquo;ll settle for 'alive and in working condition&rsquo;, we can deal with\neverything else later. And I have to find some way for him to slow down a bit. Just\na bit.&rdquo;<br/>\nShe hummed and pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of his mouth.<br/>\n&ldquo;You are a great father, Tony,&rdquo; she sighed, leaning back in the tight\ncircle of his arms.<br/>\n&ldquo;I think Morgan would mostly agree with you. Well, unless it comes to\nspinach. I&rsquo;m a very, very bad father when spinach shows on the table.&rdquo;<br/>\nShe smiled, a bit weakly, and shook her head.<br/>\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean Morgan, love.&rdquo;<br/>\nHe frowned fiercely and looked down at her flat stomach with a questioning\nface.<br/>\n&ldquo;No, I am most certainly <i>not</i>,\nyou genius. And before you start speculating and overthinking, I meant\nPeter.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;P-Peter&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off as she freed herself from his suddenly\nloose hold and pressed another kiss to his lips. &ldquo;What&hellip; how&hellip;?\nWhy?&rdquo;<br/>\nPepper looked at him from over her reading glasses.<br/>\n&ldquo;Stop being obtuse, Tony. It doesn&rsquo;t suit you.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;But, Pep&hellip; I never&hellip; I mean, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;I know. He is not yours, Tony, and both you and he are quite conscious of\nthat fact. And that&rsquo;s perfectly OK. But you can&rsquo;t deny that you just want to\ntake care of him. That he is a nice, well-mannered, reasonably self-assured\nyoung man with a great potential for career in the same industry as you work on\n- everything that you could have asked for in an apprentice. Or a son.&rdquo;<br/>\nHe shook his head weakly.<br/>\n&ldquo;And you do see how he looks at you for approval - how he listens to\neverything you tell him?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cIf he had listened to me more, he would not have found himself on that blasted\nplanet&hellip;!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cAnd both you and Stephen would not have survived the way there, because it was\nPeter\u2019s idea to space that alien, right? You\u2019ve told me so many times how quick\nhe was on his feet and how useful he was in action. Don\u2019t you think it deserves\nsome appreciation?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cIf he had stayed home&hellip;!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019d not be here to argue with me,\u201d she cut him off swiftly. \u201cHe worships\nyou, Tony. And I like him, you know. As in, if he had been your actual kid from\nsome previous marriage, I\u2019d try to be the best stepmother possible to him. He\nisn\u2019t and I can\u2019t but I\u2019m just saying.&rdquo;</p><p>He snorted at the absurdity of the idea.</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty years ago I was a blindingly\ninconsiderate, terrifyingly unreliable and astonishingly personally\nirresponsible person. And very, very much of a dick. I&rsquo;m sorry, Pep, but I was.\nHad I managed to produce a kid in these days, I would have messed him up so\nthoroughly the theoretical mother would have moved to Europe to avoid me. Now,\nPeter is a gift, in a way. I&rsquo;m getting him preconfigured. He has been set on\nthe best possible course by his uncle Ben and aunt May and he keeps to the\nstraight and narrow under her eye. All the influence I may have on him is&hellip;\nlimited. Thankfully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Self-flagellating again. I will ask Friday\nto set up alerts when you do this. You wouldn&rsquo;t have been a bad father, Tony.\nMaybe a bit eccentric. Spoiling your offspring a lot. Probably using inadequate\nlanguage. And yes, I know where Morgan learns all these swearwords and it&rsquo;s not\nfrom Happy. You&rsquo;d probably fail a lot,&rdquo; she combed away the stray curl\nfrom his forehead and he leaned into that touch, closing his eyes. &ldquo;But\nthen they&rsquo;d love you. The way Peter does. You are filling in some hole in his\nlife and he is filling in a hole in yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Morgan&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper grabbed his face and forced him to look\nat her, reminding him how strong these deceptively slim fingers were.</p><p>&ldquo;I know and you know that Morgan will\nalways be our priority,&rdquo; she said sternly. &ldquo;But we both also know\nthat forty five is <i>not</i> the optimum\ntime to have your first kid. We are both old parents, Tony. Peter is the kid\nyou should have had, if not for the way your life had been&hellip; meddled\nwith.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pep,&rdquo; he tried to interrupt her, but\nshe shushed him.</p><p>&ldquo;You would have been thirty-one when he was\nborn. Thirty-five when he started preschool. Forty when he needed your help\nwith a science project. And forty-five when he had his first crush. And you\nwould have been there for him. And if not for the general fuckuppery happening\nin your life, so would have your parents. And whatever you say about your\nfather, imagine him having to deal with someone as unbearably cute as Peter\nmust have been at ten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have had you,&rdquo; he\nmanaged to say finally. &ldquo;Or Morgan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nbut you do have us,&rdquo; she countered. &ldquo;You have us, but right now, you\ncan also have Peter. You only have to talk to him properly. Tell him he is\nimportant not because of what he can give to the company, but because he\nhimself is important. And that means he has to take care of himself and not\nrisk his health like this.&rdquo;</p><p>He swallowed and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; he croaked, his throat\ncompletely choked with all these uncomfortable emotions that Pepper had managed\nto stir in him. &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll talk to him.&rdquo;</p><p>He reached for the water he had left on the\nshelf and greedily sucked out a mouthful.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I will go to him myself and\nask if he wants you to adopt him.&rdquo;</p><p>Heroically, he managed not to spray her with\nsaid mouthful.</p><p>&ldquo;Pep&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a drastic measure, yes, but one I\nam willing to apply. Unless you manage to talk to him in the next two weeks. Counting from now.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh, shit.</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m11ThvfqEUttsb1G9K6aNHA\" target=\"_blank\">@all-the-fangeekiness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a></i></p><p><i>I\u2019m tagging based on previous chapters interactions, if you want me to remove you from the list, let me know.

Request anything we should drop off\nthere?\u201d<br>\nA beat.<br>\nThat meant AI wanted to stress something specific.<br>\n\u201cPeter did not set his search history to private,\u201d Friday reported.\n\u201cThe queries he had tried yesterday were very limited in scope,\nhowever.\u201d<br>\nHe nodded slowly.<br>\n\u201cFirst eight requests were to the National Database, in search of his\nclassmates. One of them had unfortunately been lost to a car crash directly\nafter the Decimation.\u201d<br>\nHe tapped his lip. He had had his hand in creation of the National Database,\nwhere people registered centrally the missing or the dead after the Snap and\nthen, again, marked themselves as alive once Bruce had returned everyone he\ncould. It was a mostly useful and effective service, despite certain - understandable\n- pushback from communities that felt their privacy would have been infringed\non\u2026 He would have to put Pepper on it when they had time, help to rebuild the\nwhole thing to make it more inclusive, less prone to manipulation and more\naccessible\u2026 Peter. Peter could have some ideas. Kids always saw these things\nfrom another angle. Put Peter and Pep on this, definitely. It would give Peter\nstuff to do, both socially and design-wise. He could probably get<br>\nHe rubbed his hands and made a note to the effect.<br>\n\u201cThis definitely sounds like him. Anything else?\u201d<br>\n\u201cWell, the next three queries had been requests for details of his\nauthorisation. To quote \u2018what did he mean by full access, Friday\u2019. I have\nprovided the high level summary of what kind of information he can now make use\nof. He had since requested an overview of some chosen pieces of documentation\nand asked me to take several notes and to send text messages to two of his\nclassmates, informing them in general terms of his current state. They had responded\nwith enthusiasm, as it seems their class has been rather\u2026 affected by the\ndeaths directly after the Decimation.\u201d<br>\nTony stood up and walked over to the window, trying to rein in the variety of\nideas that nagged him. One, he had to choose one thing. One specific\u2026<br>\n\u201cHow is his school doing? Actually, in general, what is the situation of\nthe schools?\u201d<br>\n\u201cCity, state, country, world-wide?\u201d<br>\nHe frowned and tapped the glass in frustration.<br>\n\u201cStart with city and then widen the analysis. Financial data, attendance,\ntechnical issues, staffing issues, organisational problems, resources\u2026 Ah,\nand estimate the students potential on the job market.\u201d<br>\n\u201cOK. This may take some time, as not all records are readily available\nonline.\u201d<br>\n\u201cSend enquiries. Hire a researcher or two to go physically to places you\ncan\u2019t reach.\u201d<br>\n\u201cSure, boss.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd what is it that you plan to do with this data, hm?\u201d Pepper\nleaned on his back, reaching around him to hand him a mug of coffee.\n\u201cBecause as the CEO I would have to sign off on any significant cash\ntransfers and other detail like this.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI think we can help a few schools around the neighbourhood without\naffecting our bottom line too much.\u201d<br>\n\u201cA few, yes, but how many do you want to help, finally?\u201d<br>\nHe huffed.<br>\n\u201cAs many as need it. Which is way too many, of course. I\u2019d have to devise\nsome kind of rating system - but then, which aspects should win? Should I help\nkids with the most potential, or ones that nobody else is going to actually\nbother with? Like Peter and his friends, for example - even though they are in\na technically oriented high school, it seems \nto be woefully underfunded. By the way, have you seen their results? I\nmean, I had a peek at what that girl does - what\u2019s her name, Friday?\u201d<br>\n\u201cMichelle, boss. Goes by 'MJ\u2019.\u201d<br>\n\u201cMichelle, exactly. What she writes about the government, well, better not\nto go into that, but her software design is truly inspired. She also seems to\nbe the most level-headed of the whole class\u2026 Peter\u2019s friend, Ned? Some other\nkids in their computer lab group? Prime candidates to create something\nseriously helpful, something that could change the future\u2026 Considering we\nhave about a billion less people than before the Decimation, what with the\nlosses around both Snaps - all three of them, I suppose - we have to find the way\nto utilise the resources\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cShhh\u2026\u201d she caught his face in both hands. \u201cTony, stop. You\ncan\u2019t save the whole world. Not right now, not this second. Focus. Step by\nstep. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to do, really? What can you\ndo?\u201d<br>\nHe took a shuddering breath.<br>\n\u201cI want for people to stop dying because of stupid reasons. And they still\ndo. Everywhere. There are shortages of everything, from food to power to\nstinking bandaids. We did it already once, after the Decimation. We should be\nable to do it again. It\u2019s just suddenly become so much harder to convince\npeople that we have to keep working together\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou are not seriously suggesting it was somehow better the previous\ntime?\u201d<br>\nHe shrugged and pulled her closer.<br>\n\u201cIt was definitely easier to talk to the third of the planet\u2019s politicians\nthan to the whole bunch who came back from the nothingness and have problems\nadjusting to the fact that the world had moved on when they were not there.\nSome had even dared to claim that no time had passed at all and it\u2019s all a hoax\nto oust them from their offices\u2026\u201d<br>\nPepper shivered. Yeah. They had both been witnesses to the great blow-up\nbetween the two available American presidents. With one of them screaming\nobscenities about a conspiracy and the other trying to defend the validity of\nher having been elected. The fact that the two had been rivals for the position\nyears earlier did not help a bit.<br>\n\u201cThere are entire countries suddenly changing hands again and there is\nnobody on the global scale who could decide which way is more just or proper.\nNot to mention religious wars\u2026\u201d<br>\nReligious wars. Oh, yeah. They had found out - the hard way - that nothing made\nreligious nutjobs more active than an apocalypse they had lived through (the\nsecond place was taken by an apocalypse they had missed due to being broken up\ninto dust in the process of it having happened) and the two of them had already\nseen their names being listed among the saints, demons, antichrists and even as\nThe Prime Reasons the Whole Thing Had Happened. Not everyone specified which\nThing they meant. It gave them such a nice flexibility of options.<br>\nThere were also many, many movements were very much interested in the identity\nof the person who had snapped the unearthly aggressors out of existence. Some\nwished to put him above their altars, some to put him on their altars - as a\nhuman sacrifice, no less. Some wanted for the Miracle Worker to come and smite\ntheir local enemies. Some wanted the Red Demon to be damned to the fires of\nhell for not allowing the Purification Army (yes, there were idiots out there\nwho claimed Thanos to be the Will of God (God of their choice)) to progress and\ncleanse the Earth. In short, the world had become much more dangerous, twisted\nand plain crazy since the Decimation had been reversed. And very risky for\nanyone who had been identified as having taken part in The Final Standoff<br>\nAs Bruce had managed to create his public image as Smart Hulk in the\n\u201cMeanwhile\u201d period, now he had to isolate himself from the general\npopulation in order to avoid all the craziness, as, unfortunately, he had been\nidentified as the person who performed the Return snap and so was a highly\nsought-after kind-of-celebrity (with an unhealthy amount of haters as usually\nattached to that kind of situation). Spending time in the New York Sanctum was,\nit turned out, his preferred choice, and Strange allowed it without questioning\nBruce\u2019s reasons, while applying all possible treatments to Hulk\u2019s very\ntreatment-resistant injuries.</p><p>Peter being the second person to wield the\nGauntlet and still nameless to the public, his security was of utmost priority,\nuntil they could get him back into a working shape and allow him to return to\nschool as if he had been an innocent victim of the aftermath of the Return,\nlike so many others. Having been anonymous all the time and successfully\ncovering his tracks with his friends, he was, for the time being, quite safe.<br>\nHopefully.<br>\nUnless someone worked out that his disappearance and then reappearance and then\nthe wound patterns\u2026<br>\n\u201cA call from Peter Parker, boss,\u201d Friday chimed softly.<br>\n\u201cAccept!\u201d<br>\nThere was a soft sound on the other side of the line.<br>\n\u201cPeter?\u201d<br>\n\u201cMr Stark,\u201d the boy sighed. \u201cJust\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. I just wanted\nto check\u2026 are you sure you wanted to give me all that\u2026 all that\naccess\u2026?\u201d<br>\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t have you work with me\nand keep you away from the vital documents.\u201d<br>\n\u201cB-but, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s so much, so much of everything\u2026 I mean, Friday is\nnow only making summaries for me, but I have so many ideas - all this, all this\ntech, and I\u2026 Are you sure?\u201d<br>\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he strode towards the window, smiling at Pepper, who\nsat on one of the tables, watching him. 'Peter,\u2019 he mouthed and she nodded.\n\u201cKid, I know what I\u2019m doing. This is my playground, my sandbox. Well,\nofficially it belongs to Pepper, but she usually lets me take the best toys\nhome. I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t begrudge anything my new junior engineer may wish to\nutilise, as long as it\u2019s in reasonable manner.\u201d<br>\n\u201cSo, no blowing things up?\u201d Peter joked weakly.<br>\n\u201cNot unless I\u2019m there to watch.\u201d<br>\nPepper hid her face in her hands, peeking at him from between her fingers.<br>\n\u201cI think\u2026 I think I have an idea, sir,\u201d the boy\u2019s voice still\nwasn\u2019t all that strong. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve asked Friday to make notes of it, if\nyou want to see it. Well. Them. More than one\u2026 idea.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAh,\u201d he paused. \u201cAre you OK with it? Me checking your notes?\nThat\u2019s your stuff. Your intellectual property.\u201d<br>\nPeter sighed.<br>\n\u201cYeah. Anything that is in my notes. I can put some official\u2026 note on\nthem, if it helps. Friday, what\u2026 do I put on the notes to make sure\u2026 Mr\nStark can make use of them?\u201d<br>\n\u201cPeter, are you feeling OK?\u201d he noticed he was straining to hear the\nboy\u2019s words more and more. \u201cFriday, status report, now!\u201d<br>\nA weak \u201cI\u2019m fine, sir,\u201d mixed with, \u201cHe\u2019s in distress, boss,\ncalling doctor Strange and princess Shuri,\u201d in his ear and he leaned his\nforehead on the wall, waiting.<br>\nWaiting.<br>\nSteps, voice.<br>\nShuri.<br>\nBerating Peter for something, unclear.<br>\nThe link being moved.<br>\n\u201cStark?\u201d sharp voice of the young scientist came through loudly.<br>\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, he started sounding as if there was something wrong,\nFriday\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cVery good call. I must thank you. He is feverish, over 102. I\u2019m\nsuspecting an infection from one of the burns after all. We are taking him for\na check and then back to isolation room. I\u2019ll update you soon, when we have new\nresults.\u201d<br>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he managed to whisper before she clicked the connection\noff.<br>\nHe slid slowly down the wall, resting his forehead on his knees.<br>\nA cool, narrow hand came to rest on his neck, rubbing it in slow circles.<br>\n\u201cHe is ill, Pep,\u201d he whispered as she sat down next to him. \u201cHe\ncalled me, he was feverish, and I hadn\u2019t noticed anything wrong. I just thought\nhe was tired from the treatment.\u201d<br>\n\u201cShuri is taking care of him, isn\u2019t she? You spoke to her? She has a\ngeneral physician there, I know.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYes, and Friday also called Strange in. I just\u2026 I just wish I could do\nmore. I wish there was something else I was good for - apart from blowing\nthings up and letting kids like him die on my watch.\u201d<br>\nShe smacked him slightly on the back of his head.<br>\n\u201cPeter isn\u2019t dead,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cAnd this wallowing in\nguilt is starting to get old. Now, get a grip and try to think, what can you do\nto help him. What does he need? What does Shuri need? Is there something\nStephen may think he\u2019d need but did not think to ask you, for whatever reason?\nSomething Peter may need?\u201d<br>\n\u201cPeter asked me to read his files,\u201d he said, mechanically. \u201cHe\nwanted me to see something, some idea that he had using the existing tech.\nFriday, send a message to doctor Strange, request feedback and ask if there are\nany resources he may need for Peter. And send Peter\u2019s note files to my\ndesktop.\u201d<br>\n\u201cDone, boss,\u201d the AI answered immediately. \u201cPrincess Shuri says\nthe fever is most probably the reaction to yesterday treatment and the fact\nthat Peter managed to twist one of his IVs by accident and became slightly\ndehydrated. He is still having problems with body temperature, as his\nhypothalamus and pituitary gland are both not regrown enough.\u201d<br>\nPepper frowned.<br>\n\u201cTony, should we be even hearing this? I mean, he is an adult and we are\nnot his family, it should be his Aunt May, not us\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cShuri isn\u2019t actually a doctor,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAt least not\nin the strict sense of a registered medical professional in US. And Strange\u2026\nhe plays by his own rules. I\u2019m sure they are sending the same reports to May,\nbut\u2026\u201d he sighed. \u201cStrange was there with us, on that awful planet.\nI think he saw it all happening anyway, long before it did happen. He applies\nsomehow\u2026 a different metric to Peter. And, anyway, Pep, what\u2019s the sense in\nbeing an arrogant, self-centered dick if I can\u2019t make use of it from time to\ntime and check on my favourite assistant? By the way, I will have to create a\nproper job description for him, I suppose\u2026\u201d<br>\nA kiss was pressed to his temple.<br>\n\u201cLet him get better first. Also, creating job descriptions is more of a\nCEO thing. At least in case of my company.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd what am I supposed to be in said company?\u201d he asked testily,\npushing himself to his feet and walking over to the table.<br>\n\u201cThe name, the pretty face and the head of the independent research and\ndesign department,\u201d she clicked something on her tablet. \u201cVoila. The\ndepartment, as of now, consists of two employees, one of which is one Anthony\nEdward Stark and, assisting him, on a position of junior engineer, Peter\nBenjamin Parker. There, done. He has a proper salary and is now officially on a\npaid sick leave due to a work-related accident. Retroactively on payroll since\nthe Return. Congratulations, department head.\u201d<br>\nHe shook his head slightly at her frivolity, but pulled her closer as he called\nthe files Friday had deposited on his main desktop and started paging through\nthem. Some notes were very highlevel, but three files went deeper into details.\nPeter must have\u2026<br>\n\u201cHe overexerted himself telling Friday all of this and that\u2019s why he is\nsick now,\u201d Pepper commented with regret. \u201cThe least we can do right\nnow is to have a look at it. Scroll on. This is fascinating.\u201d<br>\nA description of skin graft implant based on Peter\u2019s own web structure and some\nhigh-tensile material he had dug up from Friday\u2019s banks. Tony hadn\u2019t even known\nthey had a patent for something like that.<br>\nA piece of software - scraps of code, some of it only in comments and general\npseudocode to show the logic, some of it in Python - that was supposed to\ncalculate - he frowned - ah. The fluctuations of demographics, but what did he\nuse from the databanks\u2026? Tony frowned as he saw some beginnings of machine\ncode matching one of the big calculation datacenters. Ah. Using the National\nDatabase to predict population growth and pinpoint the next baby booms. What\ndid they teach in schools these days?<br>\n\u201cVery useful in any industry,\u201d Pepper breathed. \u201cIf you can make\nthis work, companies will be killing themselves to get this data.\u201d<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re a car seat producer. Or you manufacture powdered milk. Or\nhave a school. Or <i>anything</i> else that\ninvolves children. Clothes\u2026!\u201d<br><i>Indeed</i>. He squeezed her hand\nslightly.</p><p>And to think that there were people out there\nwho would have discounted Pepper Potts as nothing more than a pretty face and a\npair of lovely legs. Well, he had used to. But he had grown smarter since\u2026!<br>\nHe clicked the half-code, half-ramble document closed.</p><p>The last one was seemingly rather\u2026 common. One\npage of short, terse sentences, a description of a not-so-novel usage of the\nenergy storage unit Stark Industries had prototyped barely a month before\nReturn and had not yet implemented on a larger scale. It delineated the\npotential application of the unit for light, long-distance vehicles, with the\naddition of solar panels to recharge the whole installation from. Tony frowned\nat the document, trying to understand what the catch would be, which element\nwould be in any way innovative or groundbreaking, as he had started to expect\nfrom Peter (the boy had invented the correct composition for his webbing at\nfifteen\u2026!), but it seemed entirely\u2026 unexceptionable.<br>\nUntil he scrolled down to the description of the other installed equipment -\nstill all taken from elements now produced by Stark Industries - and saw the\nvehicle for what it was. A self sustained survival capsule. There were modules\nfor water reclamation, storage for condensed food (SI brand, too), waste\ndisposal and air refreshing. Everything economically put in, the capsule almost\nlike a tiny spaceship but destined for wandering on the surface of a planet.</p><p>\u201cA Life Pod,\u201d Pepper marked the note\nwith her caption. \u201cWeb Skin Graft and Demographic Fluctuations. Friday,\nmark them as internal, family grade. Include Peter in the family authorisation\ngroup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already in it, Pep,\u201d Tony\ninformed her softly and saw her eyebrows rise, just a smidgen.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d she stretched the display to show all three\nmain documents and additional pieces that Friday had visualised as post-it\nnotes all around them. \u201cHe must have been up all night, silly\nboy\u2026!\u201d</p><p>And all of this based solely on listening to the\nAI feeding him nearly random choice of data and him dictating the observations\nhe had theorised on in his mind. A true exercise in thought experiment. And the\ncode! He had to dictate the code\u2026!<br>\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been very interested in medicine before,\u201d he frowned at\nthe display. \u201cHis regen factor makes him rather wary of normal\ndoctors.\u201d<br>\n\u201cHe\u2019s been stuck in there for weeks now, even if unconscious. He might\nhave heard them talking about it often enough. Maybe something filtered in when\nhe was in the coma. They say people hear a lot when they are like this, in\nfact.\u201d<br>\n\u201cA message from Stephen Strange, boss.\u201d<br>\n\u201cRead it, Friday.\u201d<br>\n\u201c'I need someone to tell that boy to stop trying so hard, or I will break\nhis scrawny neck. Other than that, there are several pieces of diagnostic\nequipment we could use and Shuri hadn\u2019t had time to procure. List attached.\u2019\nand there is the list, boss.\u201d<br>\n\u201cFind if we have anything from the file in our storages, get it delivered\nto the Embassy. Anything else, order, barter for or steal. Just get it\ndone.\u201d<br>\n\u201cBoss, a message from Peter Parker.\u201d<br>\n\u201cRead it!\u201d<br>\n\u201c'I\u2019m feeling better now. Sorry to worry you, Mr Stark. I\u2019ll try to be\nless trouble in the future.\u2019\u201d<br>\nHe swore, trying to rein in his temper.<br>\n\u201cWe have to do something with this, Pepper.\u201d<br>\n\u201cWith this what? And what do you mean?\u201d<br>\nHe turned her and enveloped her in an all-encompassing hug.<br>\n\u201cThis all. All this shit that happened around us in the last few weeks.\nThat kid. I mean - he says he is sorry he is sick\u2026! Did I ever give him a\nreason to think I\u2019d be mad if he was less than perfect? Yes, I expected stuff\nfrom him, I still will. But I\u2019m not expecting him to be super-superhuman! At\nthis point, I\u2019ll settle for 'alive and in working condition\u2019, we can deal with\neverything else later. And I have to find some way for him to slow down a bit. Just\na bit.\u201d<br>\nShe hummed and pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of his mouth.<br>\n\u201cYou are a great father, Tony,\u201d she sighed, leaning back in the tight\ncircle of his arms.<br>\n\u201cI think Morgan would mostly agree with you. Well, unless it comes to\nspinach. I\u2019m a very, very bad father when spinach shows on the table.\u201d<br>\nShe smiled, a bit weakly, and shook her head.<br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean Morgan, love.\u201d<br>\nHe frowned fiercely and looked down at her flat stomach with a questioning\nface.<br>\n\u201cNo, I am most certainly <i>not</i>,\nyou genius. And before you start speculating and overthinking, I meant\nPeter.\u201d<br>\n\u201cP-Peter\u2026\u201d he trailed off as she freed herself from his suddenly\nloose hold and pressed another kiss to his lips. \u201cWhat\u2026 how\u2026?\nWhy?\u201d<br>\nPepper looked at him from over her reading glasses.<br>\n\u201cStop being obtuse, Tony. It doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d<br>\n\u201cBut, Pep\u2026 I never\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cI know. He is not yours, Tony, and both you and he are quite conscious of\nthat fact. And that\u2019s perfectly OK. But you can\u2019t deny that you just want to\ntake care of him. That he is a nice, well-mannered, reasonably self-assured\nyoung man with a great potential for career in the same industry as you work on\n- everything that you could have asked for in an apprentice. Or a son.\u201d<br>\nHe shook his head weakly.<br>\n\u201cAnd you do see how he looks at you for approval - how he listens to\neverything you tell him?\u201d<br>\n\u201cIf he had listened to me more, he would not have found himself on that blasted\nplanet\u2026!\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd both you and Stephen would not have survived the way there, because it was\nPeter\u2019s idea to space that alien, right? You\u2019ve told me so many times how quick\nhe was on his feet and how useful he was in action. Don\u2019t you think it deserves\nsome appreciation?\u201d<br>\n\u201cIf he had stayed home\u2026!\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019d not be here to argue with me,\u201d she cut him off swiftly. \u201cHe worships\nyou, Tony. And I like him, you know. As in, if he had been your actual kid from\nsome previous marriage, I\u2019d try to be the best stepmother possible to him. He\nisn\u2019t and I can\u2019t but I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at the absurdity of the idea.</p><p>\u201cTwenty years ago I was a blindingly\ninconsiderate, terrifyingly unreliable and astonishingly personally\nirresponsible person. And very, very much of a dick. I\u2019m sorry, Pep, but I was.\nHad I managed to produce a kid in these days, I would have messed him up so\nthoroughly the theoretical mother would have moved to Europe to avoid me. Now,\nPeter is a gift, in a way. I\u2019m getting him preconfigured. He has been set on\nthe best possible course by his uncle Ben and aunt May and he keeps to the\nstraight and narrow under her eye. All the influence I may have on him is\u2026\nlimited. Thankfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-flagellating again. I will ask Friday\nto set up alerts when you do this. You wouldn\u2019t have been a bad father, Tony.\nMaybe a bit eccentric. Spoiling your offspring a lot. Probably using inadequate\nlanguage. And yes, I know where Morgan learns all these swearwords and it\u2019s not\nfrom Happy. You\u2019d probably fail a lot,\u201d she combed away the stray curl\nfrom his forehead and he leaned into that touch, closing his eyes. \u201cBut\nthen they\u2019d love you. The way Peter does. You are filling in some hole in his\nlife and he is filling in a hole in yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Morgan\u2026\u201d</p><p>Pepper grabbed his face and forced him to look\nat her, reminding him how strong these deceptively slim fingers were.</p><p>\u201cI know and you know that Morgan will\nalways be our priority,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cBut we both also know\nthat forty five is <i>not</i> the optimum\ntime to have your first kid. We are both old parents, Tony. Peter is the kid\nyou should have had, if not for the way your life had been\u2026 meddled\nwith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep,\u201d he tried to interrupt her, but\nshe shushed him.</p><p>\u201cYou would have been thirty-one when he was\nborn. Thirty-five when he started preschool. Forty when he needed your help\nwith a science project. And forty-five when he had his first crush. And you\nwould have been there for him. And if not for the general fuckuppery happening\nin your life, so would have your parents. And whatever you say about your\nfather, imagine him having to deal with someone as unbearably cute as Peter\nmust have been at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have had you,\u201d he\nmanaged to say finally. \u201cOr Morgan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nbut you do have us,\u201d she countered. \u201cYou have us, but right now, you\ncan also have Peter. You only have to talk to him properly. Tell him he is\nimportant not because of what he can give to the company, but because he\nhimself is important. And that means he has to take care of himself and not\nrisk his health like this.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he croaked, his throat\ncompletely choked with all these uncomfortable emotions that Pepper had managed\nto stir in him. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the water he had left on the\nshelf and greedily sucked out a mouthful.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I will go to him myself and\nask if he wants you to adopt him.\u201d</p><p>Heroically, he managed not to spray her with\nsaid mouthful.</p><p>\u201cPep\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a drastic measure, yes, but one I\nam willing to apply. Unless you manage to talk to him in the next two weeks. Counting from now.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh, shit.</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m11ThvfqEUttsb1G9K6aNHA\" target=\"_blank\">@all-the-fangeekiness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a></i></p><p><i>I\u2019m tagging based on previous chapters interactions, if you want me to remove you from the list, let me know.

Request anything we should drop off\nthere?\u201d<br>\nA beat.<br>\nThat meant AI wanted to stress something specific.<br>\n\u201cPeter did not set his search history to private,\u201d Friday reported.\n\u201cThe queries he had tried yesterday were very limited in scope,\nhowever.\u201d<br>\nHe nodded slowly.<br>\n\u201cFirst eight requests were to the National Database, in search of his\nclassmates. One of them had unfortunately been lost to a car crash directly\nafter the Decimation.\u201d<br>\nHe tapped his lip. He had had his hand in creation of the National Database,\nwhere people registered centrally the missing or the dead after the Snap and\nthen, again, marked themselves as alive once Bruce had returned everyone he\ncould.

Anything else?\u201d<br>\n\u201cWell, the next three queries had been requests for details of his\nauthorisation. To quote \u2018what did he mean by full access, Friday\u2019. I have\nprovided the high level summary of what kind of information he can now make use\nof. He had since requested an overview of some chosen pieces of documentation\nand asked me to take several notes and to send text messages to two of his\nclassmates, informing them in general terms of his current state. They had responded\nwith enthusiasm, as it seems their class has been rather\u2026 affected by the\ndeaths directly after the Decimation.\u201d<br>\nTony stood up and walked over to the window, trying to rein in the variety of\nideas that nagged him. One, he had to choose one thing. One specific\u2026<br>\n\u201cHow is his school doing? Actually, in general, what is the situation of\nthe schools?\u201d<br>\n\u201cCity, state, country, world-wide?\u201d<br>\nHe frowned and tapped the glass in frustration.<br>\n\u201cStart with city and then widen the analysis. Financial data, attendance,\ntechnical issues, staffing issues, organisational problems, resources\u2026 Ah,\nand estimate the students potential on the job market.\u201d<br>\n\u201cOK. This may take some time, as not all records are readily available\nonline.\u201d<br>\n\u201cSend enquiries. Hire a researcher or two to go physically to places you\ncan\u2019t reach.\u201d<br>\n\u201cSure, boss.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd what is it that you plan to do with this data, hm?\u201d Pepper\nleaned on his back, reaching around him to hand him a mug of coffee.\n\u201cBecause as the CEO I would have to sign off on any significant cash\ntransfers and other detail like this.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI think we can help a few schools around the neighbourhood without\naffecting our bottom line too much.\u201d<br>\n\u201cA few, yes, but how many do you want to help, finally?\u201d<br>\nHe huffed.<br>\n\u201cAs many as need it. Which is way too many, of course. I\u2019d have to devise\nsome kind of rating system - but then, which aspects should win? Should I help\nkids with the most potential, or ones that nobody else is going to actually\nbother with? Like Peter and his friends, for example - even though they are in\na technically oriented high school, it seems \nto be woefully underfunded. By the way, have you seen their results? I\nmean, I had a peek at what that girl does - what\u2019s her name, Friday?\u201d<br>\n\u201cMichelle, boss. Goes by 'MJ\u2019.\u201d<br>\n\u201cMichelle, exactly. What she writes about the government, well, better not\nto go into that, but her software design is truly inspired. She also seems to\nbe the most level-headed of the whole class\u2026 Peter\u2019s friend, Ned? Some other\nkids in their computer lab group? Prime candidates to create something\nseriously helpful, something that could change the future\u2026 Considering we\nhave about a billion less people than before the Decimation, what with the\nlosses around both Snaps - all three of them, I suppose - we have to find the way\nto utilise the resources\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cShhh\u2026\u201d she caught his face in both hands. \u201cTony, stop. You\ncan\u2019t save the whole world. Not right now, not this second. Focus. Step by\nstep. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to do, really? What can you\ndo?\u201d<br>\nHe took a shuddering breath.<br>\n\u201cI want for people to stop dying because of stupid reasons. And they still\ndo. Everywhere. There are shortages of everything, from food to power to\nstinking bandaids. We did it already once, after the Decimation. We should be\nable to do it again. It\u2019s just suddenly become so much harder to convince\npeople that we have to keep working together\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou are not seriously suggesting it was somehow better the previous\ntime?\u201d<br>\nHe shrugged and pulled her closer.<br>\n\u201cIt was definitely easier to talk to the third of the planet\u2019s politicians\nthan to the whole bunch who came back from the nothingness and have problems\nadjusting to the fact that the world had moved on when they were not there.\nSome had even dared to claim that no time had passed at all and it\u2019s all a hoax\nto oust them from their offices\u2026\u201d<br>\nPepper shivered. Yeah. They had both been witnesses to the great blow-up\nbetween the two available American presidents. With one of them screaming\nobscenities about a conspiracy and the other trying to defend the validity of\nher having been elected. The fact that the two had been rivals for the position\nyears earlier did not help a bit.<br>\n\u201cThere are entire countries suddenly changing hands again and there is\nnobody on the global scale who could decide which way is more just or proper.\nNot to mention religious wars\u2026\u201d<br>\nReligious wars. Oh, yeah. They had found out - the hard way - that nothing made\nreligious nutjobs more active than an apocalypse they had lived through (the\nsecond place was taken by an apocalypse they had missed due to being broken up\ninto dust in the process of it having happened) and the two of them had already\nseen their names being listed among the saints, demons, antichrists and even as\nThe Prime Reasons the Whole Thing Had Happened. Not everyone specified which\nThing they meant. It gave them such a nice flexibility of options.<br>\nThere were also many, many movements were very much interested in the identity\nof the person who had snapped the unearthly aggressors out of existence. Some\nwished to put him above their altars, some to put him on their altars - as a\nhuman sacrifice, no less. Some wanted for the Miracle Worker to come and smite\ntheir local enemies. Some wanted the Red Demon to be damned to the fires of\nhell for not allowing the Purification Army (yes, there were idiots out there\nwho claimed Thanos to be the Will of God (God of their choice)) to progress and\ncleanse the Earth. In short, the world had become much more dangerous, twisted\nand plain crazy since the Decimation had been reversed. And very risky for\nanyone who had been identified as having taken part in The Final Standoff<br>\nAs Bruce had managed to create his public image as Smart Hulk in the\n\u201cMeanwhile\u201d period, now he had to isolate himself from the general\npopulation in order to avoid all the craziness, as, unfortunately, he had been\nidentified as the person who performed the Return snap and so was a highly\nsought-after kind-of-celebrity (with an unhealthy amount of haters as usually\nattached to that kind of situation). Spending time in the New York Sanctum was,\nit turned out, his preferred choice, and Strange allowed it without questioning\nBruce\u2019s reasons, while applying all possible treatments to Hulk\u2019s very\ntreatment-resistant injuries.</p><p>Peter being the second person to wield the\nGauntlet and still nameless to the public, his security was of utmost priority,\nuntil they could get him back into a working shape and allow him to return to\nschool as if he had been an innocent victim of the aftermath of the Return,\nlike so many others. Having been anonymous all the time and successfully\ncovering his tracks with his friends, he was, for the time being, quite safe.<br>\nHopefully.<br>\nUnless someone worked out that his disappearance and then reappearance and then\nthe wound patterns\u2026<br>\n\u201cA call from Peter Parker, boss,\u201d Friday chimed softly.<br>\n\u201cAccept!\u201d<br>\nThere was a soft sound on the other side of the line.<br>\n\u201cPeter?\u201d<br>\n\u201cMr Stark,\u201d the boy sighed. \u201cJust\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. I just wanted\nto check\u2026 are you sure you wanted to give me all that\u2026 all that\naccess\u2026?\u201d<br>\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t have you work with me\nand keep you away from the vital documents.\u201d<br>\n\u201cB-but, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s so much, so much of everything\u2026 I mean, Friday is\nnow only making summaries for me, but I have so many ideas - all this, all this\ntech, and I\u2026 Are you sure?\u201d<br>\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he strode towards the window, smiling at Pepper, who\nsat on one of the tables, watching him. 'Peter,\u2019 he mouthed and she nodded.\n\u201cKid, I know what I\u2019m doing. This is my playground, my sandbox. Well,\nofficially it belongs to Pepper, but she usually lets me take the best toys\nhome. I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t begrudge anything my new junior engineer may wish to\nutilise, as long as it\u2019s in reasonable manner.\u201d<br>\n\u201cSo, no blowing things up?\u201d Peter joked weakly.<br>\n\u201cNot unless I\u2019m there to watch.\u201d<br>\nPepper hid her face in her hands, peeking at him from between her fingers.<br>\n\u201cI think\u2026 I think I have an idea, sir,\u201d the boy\u2019s voice still\nwasn\u2019t all that strong. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve asked Friday to make notes of it, if\nyou want to see it. Well. Them. More than one\u2026 idea.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAh,\u201d he paused. \u201cAre you OK with it? Me checking your notes?\nThat\u2019s your stuff. Your intellectual property.\u201d<br>\nPeter sighed.<br>\n\u201cYeah. Anything that is in my notes. I can put some official\u2026 note on\nthem, if it helps. Friday, what\u2026 do I put on the notes to make sure\u2026 Mr\nStark can make use of them?\u201d<br>\n\u201cPeter, are you feeling OK?\u201d he noticed he was straining to hear the\nboy\u2019s words more and more. \u201cFriday, status report, now!\u201d<br>\nA weak \u201cI\u2019m fine, sir,\u201d mixed with, \u201cHe\u2019s in distress, boss,\ncalling doctor Strange and princess Shuri,\u201d in his ear and he leaned his\nforehead on the wall, waiting.<br>\nWaiting.<br>\nSteps, voice.<br>\nShuri.<br>\nBerating Peter for something, unclear.<br>\nThe link being moved.<br>\n\u201cStark?\u201d sharp voice of the young scientist came through loudly.<br>\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, he started sounding as if there was something wrong,\nFriday\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cVery good call. I must thank you. He is feverish, over 102. I\u2019m\nsuspecting an infection from one of the burns after all. We are taking him for\na check and then back to isolation room. I\u2019ll update you soon, when we have new\nresults.\u201d<br>\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he managed to whisper before she clicked the connection\noff.<br>\nHe slid slowly down the wall, resting his forehead on his knees.<br>\nA cool, narrow hand came to rest on his neck, rubbing it in slow circles.<br>\n\u201cHe is ill, Pep,\u201d he whispered as she sat down next to him. \u201cHe\ncalled me, he was feverish, and I hadn\u2019t noticed anything wrong. I just thought\nhe was tired from the treatment.\u201d<br>\n\u201cShuri is taking care of him, isn\u2019t she? You spoke to her? She has a\ngeneral physician there, I know.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYes, and Friday also called Strange in. I just\u2026 I just wish I could do\nmore. I wish there was something else I was good for - apart from blowing\nthings up and letting kids like him die on my watch.\u201d<br>\nShe smacked him slightly on the back of his head.<br>\n\u201cPeter isn\u2019t dead,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cAnd this wallowing in\nguilt is starting to get old. Now, get a grip and try to think, what can you do\nto help him. What does he need? What does Shuri need? Is there something\nStephen may think he\u2019d need but did not think to ask you, for whatever reason?\nSomething Peter may need?\u201d<br>\n\u201cPeter asked me to read his files,\u201d he said, mechanically. \u201cHe\nwanted me to see something, some idea that he had using the existing tech.\nFriday, send a message to doctor Strange, request feedback and ask if there are\nany resources he may need for Peter. And send Peter\u2019s note files to my\ndesktop.\u201d<br>\n\u201cDone, boss,\u201d the AI answered immediately. \u201cPrincess Shuri says\nthe fever is most probably the reaction to yesterday treatment and the fact\nthat Peter managed to twist one of his IVs by accident and became slightly\ndehydrated. He is still having problems with body temperature, as his\nhypothalamus and pituitary gland are both not regrown enough.\u201d<br>\nPepper frowned.<br>\n\u201cTony, should we be even hearing this? I mean, he is an adult and we are\nnot his family, it should be his Aunt May, not us\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cShuri isn\u2019t actually a doctor,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAt least not\nin the strict sense of a registered medical professional in US. And Strange\u2026\nhe plays by his own rules. I\u2019m sure they are sending the same reports to May,\nbut\u2026\u201d he sighed. \u201cStrange was there with us, on that awful planet.\nI think he saw it all happening anyway, long before it did happen. He applies\nsomehow\u2026 a different metric to Peter. And, anyway, Pep, what\u2019s the sense in\nbeing an arrogant, self-centered dick if I can\u2019t make use of it from time to\ntime and check on my favourite assistant? By the way, I will have to create a\nproper job description for him, I suppose\u2026\u201d<br>\nA kiss was pressed to his temple.<br>\n\u201cLet him get better first. Also, creating job descriptions is more of a\nCEO thing. At least in case of my company.\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd what am I supposed to be in said company?\u201d he asked testily,\npushing himself to his feet and walking over to the table.<br>\n\u201cThe name, the pretty face and the head of the independent research and\ndesign department,\u201d she clicked something on her tablet. \u201cVoila. The\ndepartment, as of now, consists of two employees, one of which is one Anthony\nEdward Stark and, assisting him, on a position of junior engineer, Peter\nBenjamin Parker. There, done. He has a proper salary and is now officially on a\npaid sick leave due to a work-related accident. Retroactively on payroll since\nthe Return. Congratulations, department head.\u201d<br>\nHe shook his head slightly at her frivolity, but pulled her closer as he called\nthe files Friday had deposited on his main desktop and started paging through\nthem. Some notes were very highlevel, but three files went deeper into details.\nPeter must have\u2026<br>\n\u201cHe overexerted himself telling Friday all of this and that\u2019s why he is\nsick now,\u201d Pepper commented with regret. \u201cThe least we can do right\nnow is to have a look at it. Scroll on. This is fascinating.\u201d<br>\nA description of skin graft implant based on Peter\u2019s own web structure and some\nhigh-tensile material he had dug up from Friday\u2019s banks. Tony hadn\u2019t even known\nthey had a patent for something like that.<br>\nA piece of software - scraps of code, some of it only in comments and general\npseudocode to show the logic, some of it in Python - that was supposed to\ncalculate - he frowned - ah. The fluctuations of demographics, but what did he\nuse from the databanks\u2026? Tony frowned as he saw some beginnings of machine\ncode matching one of the big calculation datacenters. Ah. Using the National\nDatabase to predict population growth and pinpoint the next baby booms. What\ndid they teach in schools these days?<br>\n\u201cVery useful in any industry,\u201d Pepper breathed. \u201cIf you can make\nthis work, companies will be killing themselves to get this data.\u201d<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re a car seat producer. Or you manufacture powdered milk. Or\nhave a school. Or <i>anything</i> else that\ninvolves children. Clothes\u2026!\u201d<br><i>Indeed</i>. He squeezed her hand\nslightly.</p><p>And to think that there were people out there\nwho would have discounted Pepper Potts as nothing more than a pretty face and a\npair of lovely legs. Well, he had used to. But he had grown smarter since\u2026!<br>\nHe clicked the half-code, half-ramble document closed.</p><p>The last one was seemingly rather\u2026 common. One\npage of short, terse sentences, a description of a not-so-novel usage of the\nenergy storage unit Stark Industries had prototyped barely a month before\nReturn and had not yet implemented on a larger scale. It delineated the\npotential application of the unit for light, long-distance vehicles, with the\naddition of solar panels to recharge the whole installation from. Tony frowned\nat the document, trying to understand what the catch would be, which element\nwould be in any way innovative or groundbreaking, as he had started to expect\nfrom Peter (the boy had invented the correct composition for his webbing at\nfifteen\u2026!), but it seemed entirely\u2026 unexceptionable.<br>\nUntil he scrolled down to the description of the other installed equipment -\nstill all taken from elements now produced by Stark Industries - and saw the\nvehicle for what it was. A self sustained survival capsule. There were modules\nfor water reclamation, storage for condensed food (SI brand, too), waste\ndisposal and air refreshing. Everything economically put in, the capsule almost\nlike a tiny spaceship but destined for wandering on the surface of a planet.</p><p>\u201cA Life Pod,\u201d Pepper marked the note\nwith her caption. \u201cWeb Skin Graft and Demographic Fluctuations. Friday,\nmark them as internal, family grade. Include Peter in the family authorisation\ngroup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already in it, Pep,\u201d Tony\ninformed her softly and saw her eyebrows rise, just a smidgen.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d she stretched the display to show all three\nmain documents and additional pieces that Friday had visualised as post-it\nnotes all around them. \u201cHe must have been up all night, silly\nboy\u2026!\u201d</p><p>And all of this based solely on listening to the\nAI feeding him nearly random choice of data and him dictating the observations\nhe had theorised on in his mind. A true exercise in thought experiment. And the\ncode! He had to dictate the code\u2026!<br>\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been very interested in medicine before,\u201d he frowned at\nthe display. \u201cHis regen factor makes him rather wary of normal\ndoctors.\u201d<br>\n\u201cHe\u2019s been stuck in there for weeks now, even if unconscious. He might\nhave heard them talking about it often enough. Maybe something filtered in when\nhe was in the coma. They say people hear a lot when they are like this, in\nfact.\u201d<br>\n\u201cA message from Stephen Strange, boss.\u201d<br>\n\u201cRead it, Friday.\u201d<br>\n\u201c'I need someone to tell that boy to stop trying so hard, or I will break\nhis scrawny neck. Other than that, there are several pieces of diagnostic\nequipment we could use and Shuri hadn\u2019t had time to procure. List attached.\u2019\nand there is the list, boss.\u201d<br>\n\u201cFind if we have anything from the file in our storages, get it delivered\nto the Embassy. Anything else, order, barter for or steal. Just get it\ndone.\u201d<br>\n\u201cBoss, a message from Peter Parker.\u201d<br>\n\u201cRead it!\u201d<br>\n\u201c'I\u2019m feeling better now. Sorry to worry you, Mr Stark. I\u2019ll try to be\nless trouble in the future.\u2019\u201d<br>\nHe swore, trying to rein in his temper.<br>\n\u201cWe have to do something with this, Pepper.\u201d<br>\n\u201cWith this what? And what do you mean?\u201d<br>\nHe turned her and enveloped her in an all-encompassing hug.<br>\n\u201cThis all. All this shit that happened around us in the last few weeks.\nThat kid. I mean - he says he is sorry he is sick\u2026! Did I ever give him a\nreason to think I\u2019d be mad if he was less than perfect? Yes, I expected stuff\nfrom him, I still will. But I\u2019m not expecting him to be super-superhuman! At\nthis point, I\u2019ll settle for 'alive and in working condition\u2019, we can deal with\neverything else later. And I have to find some way for him to slow down a bit. Just\na bit.\u201d<br>\nShe hummed and pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of his mouth.<br>\n\u201cYou are a great father, Tony,\u201d she sighed, leaning back in the tight\ncircle of his arms.<br>\n\u201cI think Morgan would mostly agree with you. Well, unless it comes to\nspinach. I\u2019m a very, very bad father when spinach shows on the table.\u201d<br>\nShe smiled, a bit weakly, and shook her head.<br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean Morgan, love.\u201d<br>\nHe frowned fiercely and looked down at her flat stomach with a questioning\nface.<br>\n\u201cNo, I am most certainly <i>not</i>,\nyou genius. And before you start speculating and overthinking, I meant\nPeter.\u201d<br>\n\u201cP-Peter\u2026\u201d he trailed off as she freed herself from his suddenly\nloose hold and pressed another kiss to his lips. \u201cWhat\u2026 how\u2026?\nWhy?\u201d<br>\nPepper looked at him from over her reading glasses.<br>\n\u201cStop being obtuse, Tony. It doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d<br>\n\u201cBut, Pep\u2026 I never\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\n\u201cI know. He is not yours, Tony, and both you and he are quite conscious of\nthat fact. And that\u2019s perfectly OK. But you can\u2019t deny that you just want to\ntake care of him. That he is a nice, well-mannered, reasonably self-assured\nyoung man with a great potential for career in the same industry as you work on\n- everything that you could have asked for in an apprentice. Or a son.\u201d<br>\nHe shook his head weakly.<br>\n\u201cAnd you do see how he looks at you for approval - how he listens to\neverything you tell him?\u201d<br>\n\u201cIf he had listened to me more, he would not have found himself on that blasted\nplanet\u2026!\u201d<br>\n\u201cAnd both you and Stephen would not have survived the way there, because it was\nPeter\u2019s idea to space that alien, right? You\u2019ve told me so many times how quick\nhe was on his feet and how useful he was in action. Don\u2019t you think it deserves\nsome appreciation?\u201d<br>\n\u201cIf he had stayed home\u2026!\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019d not be here to argue with me,\u201d she cut him off swiftly. \u201cHe worships\nyou, Tony. And I like him, you know. As in, if he had been your actual kid from\nsome previous marriage, I\u2019d try to be the best stepmother possible to him. He\nisn\u2019t and I can\u2019t but I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at the absurdity of the idea.</p><p>\u201cTwenty years ago I was a blindingly\ninconsiderate, terrifyingly unreliable and astonishingly personally\nirresponsible person. And very, very much of a dick. I\u2019m sorry, Pep, but I was.\nHad I managed to produce a kid in these days, I would have messed him up so\nthoroughly the theoretical mother would have moved to Europe to avoid me. Now,\nPeter is a gift, in a way. I\u2019m getting him preconfigured. He has been set on\nthe best possible course by his uncle Ben and aunt May and he keeps to the\nstraight and narrow under her eye. All the influence I may have on him is\u2026\nlimited. Thankfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-flagellating again. I will ask Friday\nto set up alerts when you do this. You wouldn\u2019t have been a bad father, Tony.\nMaybe a bit eccentric. Spoiling your offspring a lot. Probably using inadequate\nlanguage. And yes, I know where Morgan learns all these swearwords and it\u2019s not\nfrom Happy. You\u2019d probably fail a lot,\u201d she combed away the stray curl\nfrom his forehead and he leaned into that touch, closing his eyes. \u201cBut\nthen they\u2019d love you. The way Peter does. You are filling in some hole in his\nlife and he is filling in a hole in yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Morgan\u2026\u201d</p><p>Pepper grabbed his face and forced him to look\nat her, reminding him how strong these deceptively slim fingers were.</p><p>\u201cI know and you know that Morgan will\nalways be our priority,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cBut we both also know\nthat forty five is <i>not</i> the optimum\ntime to have your first kid. We are both old parents, Tony. Peter is the kid\nyou should have had, if not for the way your life had been\u2026 meddled\nwith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep,\u201d he tried to interrupt her, but\nshe shushed him.</p><p>\u201cYou would have been thirty-one when he was\nborn. Thirty-five when he started preschool. Forty when he needed your help\nwith a science project. And forty-five when he had his first crush. And you\nwould have been there for him. And if not for the general fuckuppery happening\nin your life, so would have your parents.

The nerve grafts\ndone by doctor Strange are holding and it seems to be time to move on to the\narm scarring. She reports that he is alert, conscious and reasonably fine, but\nin discomfort due to skin rawness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;OK. Anything else? Did&hellip; did Peter need something? Request anything we should drop off\nthere?&rdquo;<br />\nA beat.<br />\nThat meant AI wanted to stress something specific.<br />\n&ldquo;Peter did not set his search history to private,&rdquo; Friday reported.\n&ldquo;The queries he had tried yesterday were very limited in scope,\nhowever.&rdquo;<br />\nHe nodded slowly.<br />\n&ldquo;First eight requests were to the National Database, in search of his\nclassmates. One of them had unfortunately been lost to a car crash directly\nafter the Decimation.&rdquo;<br />\nHe tapped his lip. He had had his hand in creation of the National Database,\nwhere people registered centrally the missing or the dead after the Snap and\nthen, again, marked themselves as alive once Bruce had returned everyone he\ncould. It was a mostly useful and effective service, despite certain - understandable\n- pushback from communities that felt their privacy would have been infringed\non&hellip; He would have to put Pepper on it when they had time, help to rebuild the\nwhole thing to make it more inclusive, less prone to manipulation and more\naccessible&hellip; Peter. Peter could have some ideas. Kids always saw these things\nfrom another angle. Put Peter and Pep on this, definitely. It would give Peter\nstuff to do, both socially and design-wise. He could probably get<br />\nHe rubbed his hands and made a note to the effect.<br />\n&ldquo;This definitely sounds like him. Anything else?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Well, the next three queries had been requests for details of his\nauthorisation. To quote &lsquo;what did he mean by full access, Friday&rsquo;. I have\nprovided the high level summary of what kind of information he can now make use\nof. He had since requested an overview of some chosen pieces of documentation\nand asked me to take several notes and to send text messages to two of his\nclassmates, informing them in general terms of his current state. They had responded\nwith enthusiasm, as it seems their class has been rather&hellip; affected by the\ndeaths directly after the Decimation.&rdquo;<br />\nTony stood up and walked over to the window, trying to rein in the variety of\nideas that nagged him. One, he had to choose one thing. One specific&hellip;<br />\n&ldquo;How is his school doing? Actually, in general, what is the situation of\nthe schools?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;City, state, country, world-wide?&rdquo;<br />\nHe frowned and tapped the glass in frustration.<br />\n&ldquo;Start with city and then widen the analysis. Financial data, attendance,\ntechnical issues, staffing issues, organisational problems, resources&hellip; Ah,\nand estimate the students potential on the job market.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;OK. This may take some time, as not all records are readily available\nonline.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Send enquiries. Hire a researcher or two to go physically to places you\ncan&rsquo;t reach.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Sure, boss.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;And what is it that you plan to do with this data, hm?&rdquo; Pepper\nleaned on his back, reaching around him to hand him a mug of coffee.\n&ldquo;Because as the CEO I would have to sign off on any significant cash\ntransfers and other detail like this.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I think we can help a few schools around the neighbourhood without\naffecting our bottom line too much.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;A few, yes, but how many do you want to help, finally?&rdquo;<br />\nHe huffed.<br />\n&ldquo;As many as need it. Which is way too many, of course. I&rsquo;d have to devise\nsome kind of rating system - but then, which aspects should win? Should I help\nkids with the most potential, or ones that nobody else is going to actually\nbother with? Like Peter and his friends, for example - even though they are in\na technically oriented high school, it seems \nto be woefully underfunded. By the way, have you seen their results? I\nmean, I had a peek at what that girl does - what&rsquo;s her name, Friday?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Michelle, boss. Goes by 'MJ&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Michelle, exactly. What she writes about the government, well, better not\nto go into that, but her software design is truly inspired. She also seems to\nbe the most level-headed of the whole class&hellip; Peter&rsquo;s friend, Ned? Some other\nkids in their computer lab group? Prime candidates to create something\nseriously helpful, something that could change the future&hellip; Considering we\nhave about a billion less people than before the Decimation, what with the\nlosses around both Snaps - all three of them, I suppose - we have to find the way\nto utilise the resources&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Shhh&hellip;&rdquo; she caught his face in both hands. &ldquo;Tony, stop. You\ncan&rsquo;t save the whole world. Not right now, not this second. Focus. Step by\nstep. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to do, really? What can you\ndo?&rdquo;<br />\nHe took a shuddering breath.<br />\n&ldquo;I want for people to stop dying because of stupid reasons. And they still\ndo. Everywhere. There are shortages of everything, from food to power to\nstinking bandaids. We did it already once, after the Decimation. We should be\nable to do it again. It&rsquo;s just suddenly become so much harder to convince\npeople that we have to keep working together&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;You are not seriously suggesting it was somehow better the previous\ntime?&rdquo;<br />\nHe shrugged and pulled her closer.<br />\n&ldquo;It was definitely easier to talk to the third of the planet&rsquo;s politicians\nthan to the whole bunch who came back from the nothingness and have problems\nadjusting to the fact that the world had moved on when they were not there.\nSome had even dared to claim that no time had passed at all and it&rsquo;s all a hoax\nto oust them from their offices&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\nPepper shivered. Yeah. They had both been witnesses to the great blow-up\nbetween the two available American presidents. With one of them screaming\nobscenities about a conspiracy and the other trying to defend the validity of\nher having been elected. The fact that the two had been rivals for the position\nyears earlier did not help a bit.<br />\n&ldquo;There are entire countries suddenly changing hands again and there is\nnobody on the global scale who could decide which way is more just or proper.\nNot to mention religious wars&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\nReligious wars. Oh, yeah. They had found out - the hard way - that nothing made\nreligious nutjobs more active than an apocalypse they had lived through (the\nsecond place was taken by an apocalypse they had missed due to being broken up\ninto dust in the process of it having happened) and the two of them had already\nseen their names being listed among the saints, demons, antichrists and even as\nThe Prime Reasons the Whole Thing Had Happened. Not everyone specified which\nThing they meant. It gave them such a nice flexibility of options.<br />\nThere were also many, many movements were very much interested in the identity\nof the person who had snapped the unearthly aggressors out of existence. Some\nwished to put him above their altars, some to put him on their altars - as a\nhuman sacrifice, no less. Some wanted for the Miracle Worker to come and smite\ntheir local enemies. Some wanted the Red Demon to be damned to the fires of\nhell for not allowing the Purification Army (yes, there were idiots out there\nwho claimed Thanos to be the Will of God (God of their choice)) to progress and\ncleanse the Earth. In short, the world had become much more dangerous, twisted\nand plain crazy since the Decimation had been reversed. And very risky for\nanyone who had been identified as having taken part in The Final Standoff<br />\nAs Bruce had managed to create his public image as Smart Hulk in the\n&ldquo;Meanwhile&rdquo; period, now he had to isolate himself from the general\npopulation in order to avoid all the craziness, as, unfortunately, he had been\nidentified as the person who performed the Return snap and so was a highly\nsought-after kind-of-celebrity (with an unhealthy amount of haters as usually\nattached to that kind of situation). Spending time in the New York Sanctum was,\nit turned out, his preferred choice, and Strange allowed it without questioning\nBruce&rsquo;s reasons, while applying all possible treatments to Hulk&rsquo;s very\ntreatment-resistant injuries.</p><p>Peter being the second person to wield the\nGauntlet and still nameless to the public, his security was of utmost priority,\nuntil they could get him back into a working shape and allow him to return to\nschool as if he had been an innocent victim of the aftermath of the Return,\nlike so many others. Having been anonymous all the time and successfully\ncovering his tracks with his friends, he was, for the time being, quite safe.<br />\nHopefully.<br />\nUnless someone worked out that his disappearance and then reappearance and then\nthe wound patterns&hellip;<br />\n&ldquo;A call from Peter Parker, boss,&rdquo; Friday chimed softly.<br />\n&ldquo;Accept!&rdquo;<br />\nThere was a soft sound on the other side of the line.<br />\n&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Mr Stark,&rdquo; the boy sighed. &ldquo;Just&hellip; I&rsquo;m so sorry. I just wanted\nto check&hellip; are you sure you wanted to give me all that&hellip; all that\naccess&hellip;?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered immediately. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you work with me\nand keep you away from the vital documents.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;B-but, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s so much, so much of everything&hellip; I mean, Friday is\nnow only making summaries for me, but I have so many ideas - all this, all this\ntech, and I&hellip; Are you sure?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he strode towards the window, smiling at Pepper, who\nsat on one of the tables, watching him. 'Peter,&rsquo; he mouthed and she nodded.\n&ldquo;Kid, I know what I&rsquo;m doing. This is my playground, my sandbox. Well,\nofficially it belongs to Pepper, but she usually lets me take the best toys\nhome. I&rsquo;m sure she won&rsquo;t begrudge anything my new junior engineer may wish to\nutilise, as long as it&rsquo;s in reasonable manner.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;So, no blowing things up?&rdquo; Peter joked weakly.<br />\n&ldquo;Not unless I&rsquo;m there to watch.&rdquo;<br />\nPepper hid her face in her hands, peeking at him from between her fingers.<br />\n&ldquo;I think&hellip; I think I have an idea, sir,&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s voice still\nwasn&rsquo;t all that strong. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&hellip; I&rsquo;ve asked Friday to make notes of it, if\nyou want to see it. Well. Them. More than one&hellip; idea.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he paused. &ldquo;Are you OK with it? Me checking your notes?\nThat&rsquo;s your stuff. Your intellectual property.&rdquo;<br />\nPeter sighed.<br />\n&ldquo;Yeah. Anything that is in my notes. I can put some official&hellip; note on\nthem, if it helps. Friday, what&hellip; do I put on the notes to make sure&hellip; Mr\nStark can make use of them?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Peter, are you feeling OK?&rdquo; he noticed he was straining to hear the\nboy&rsquo;s words more and more. &ldquo;Friday, status report, now!&rdquo;<br />\nA weak &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, sir,&rdquo; mixed with, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in distress, boss,\ncalling doctor Strange and princess Shuri,&rdquo; in his ear and he leaned his\nforehead on the wall, waiting.<br />\nWaiting.<br />\nSteps, voice.<br />\nShuri.<br />\nBerating Peter for something, unclear.<br />\nThe link being moved.<br />\n&ldquo;Stark?&rdquo; sharp voice of the young scientist came through loudly.<br />\n&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m sorry, he started sounding as if there was something wrong,\nFriday&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Very good call. I must thank you. He is feverish, over 102. I&rsquo;m\nsuspecting an infection from one of the burns after all. We are taking him for\na check and then back to isolation room. I&rsquo;ll update you soon, when we have new\nresults.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he managed to whisper before she clicked the connection\noff.<br />\nHe slid slowly down the wall, resting his forehead on his knees.<br />\nA cool, narrow hand came to rest on his neck, rubbing it in slow circles.<br />\n&ldquo;He is ill, Pep,&rdquo; he whispered as she sat down next to him. &ldquo;He\ncalled me, he was feverish, and I hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything wrong. I just thought\nhe was tired from the treatment.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Shuri is taking care of him, isn&rsquo;t she? You spoke to her? She has a\ngeneral physician there, I know.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Yes, and Friday also called Strange in. I just&hellip; I just wish I could do\nmore. I wish there was something else I was good for - apart from blowing\nthings up and letting kids like him die on my watch.&rdquo;<br />\nShe smacked him slightly on the back of his head.<br />\n&ldquo;Peter isn&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;And this wallowing in\nguilt is starting to get old. Now, get a grip and try to think, what can you do\nto help him. What does he need? What does Shuri need? Is there something\nStephen may think he&rsquo;d need but did not think to ask you, for whatever reason?\nSomething Peter may need?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Peter asked me to read his files,&rdquo; he said, mechanically. &ldquo;He\nwanted me to see something, some idea that he had using the existing tech.\nFriday, send a message to doctor Strange, request feedback and ask if there are\nany resources he may need for Peter. And send Peter&rsquo;s note files to my\ndesktop.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Done, boss,&rdquo; the AI answered immediately. &ldquo;Princess Shuri says\nthe fever is most probably the reaction to yesterday treatment and the fact\nthat Peter managed to twist one of his IVs by accident and became slightly\ndehydrated. He is still having problems with body temperature, as his\nhypothalamus and pituitary gland are both not regrown enough.&rdquo;<br />\nPepper frowned.<br />\n&ldquo;Tony, should we be even hearing this? I mean, he is an adult and we are\nnot his family, it should be his Aunt May, not us&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Shuri isn&rsquo;t actually a doctor,&rdquo; he reminded her. &ldquo;At least not\nin the strict sense of a registered medical professional in US. And Strange&hellip;\nhe plays by his own rules. I&rsquo;m sure they are sending the same reports to May,\nbut&hellip;&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Strange was there with us, on that awful planet.\nI think he saw it all happening anyway, long before it did happen. He applies\nsomehow&hellip; a different metric to Peter. And, anyway, Pep, what&rsquo;s the sense in\nbeing an arrogant, self-centered dick if I can&rsquo;t make use of it from time to\ntime and check on my favourite assistant? By the way, I will have to create a\nproper job description for him, I suppose&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\nA kiss was pressed to his temple.<br />\n&ldquo;Let him get better first. Also, creating job descriptions is more of a\nCEO thing. At least in case of my company.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;And what am I supposed to be in said company?&rdquo; he asked testily,\npushing himself to his feet and walking over to the table.<br />\n&ldquo;The name, the pretty face and the head of the independent research and\ndesign department,&rdquo; she clicked something on her tablet. &ldquo;Voila. The\ndepartment, as of now, consists of two employees, one of which is one Anthony\nEdward Stark and, assisting him, on a position of junior engineer, Peter\nBenjamin Parker. There, done. He has a proper salary and is now officially on a\npaid sick leave due to a work-related accident. Retroactively on payroll since\nthe Return. Congratulations, department head.&rdquo;<br />\nHe shook his head slightly at her frivolity, but pulled her closer as he called\nthe files Friday had deposited on his main desktop and started paging through\nthem. Some notes were very highlevel, but three files went deeper into details.\nPeter must have&hellip;<br />\n&ldquo;He overexerted himself telling Friday all of this and that&rsquo;s why he is\nsick now,&rdquo; Pepper commented with regret. &ldquo;The least we can do right\nnow is to have a look at it. Scroll on. This is fascinating.&rdquo;<br />\nA description of skin graft implant based on Peter&rsquo;s own web structure and some\nhigh-tensile material he had dug up from Friday&rsquo;s banks. Tony hadn&rsquo;t even known\nthey had a patent for something like that.<br />\nA piece of software - scraps of code, some of it only in comments and general\npseudocode to show the logic, some of it in Python - that was supposed to\ncalculate - he frowned - ah. The fluctuations of demographics, but what did he\nuse from the databanks&hellip;? Tony frowned as he saw some beginnings of machine\ncode matching one of the big calculation datacenters. Ah. Using the National\nDatabase to predict population growth and pinpoint the next baby booms. What\ndid they teach in schools these days?<br />\n&ldquo;Very useful in any industry,&rdquo; Pepper breathed. &ldquo;If you can make\nthis work, companies will be killing themselves to get this data.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;What&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Imagine you&rsquo;re a car seat producer. Or you manufacture powdered milk. Or\nhave a school. Or <i>anything</i> else that\ninvolves children. Clothes&hellip;!&rdquo;<br /><i>Indeed</i>. He squeezed her hand\nslightly.</p><p>And to think that there were people out there\nwho would have discounted Pepper Potts as nothing more than a pretty face and a\npair of lovely legs. Well, he had used to. But he had grown smarter since&hellip;!<br />\nHe clicked the half-code, half-ramble document closed.</p><p>The last one was seemingly rather&hellip; common. One\npage of short, terse sentences, a description of a not-so-novel usage of the\nenergy storage unit Stark Industries had prototyped barely a month before\nReturn and had not yet implemented on a larger scale. It delineated the\npotential application of the unit for light, long-distance vehicles, with the\naddition of solar panels to recharge the whole installation from. Tony frowned\nat the document, trying to understand what the catch would be, which element\nwould be in any way innovative or groundbreaking, as he had started to expect\nfrom Peter (the boy had invented the correct composition for his webbing at\nfifteen&hellip;!), but it seemed entirely&hellip; unexceptionable.<br />\nUntil he scrolled down to the description of the other installed equipment -\nstill all taken from elements now produced by Stark Industries - and saw the\nvehicle for what it was. A self sustained survival capsule. There were modules\nfor water reclamation, storage for condensed food (SI brand, too), waste\ndisposal and air refreshing. Everything economically put in, the capsule almost\nlike a tiny spaceship but destined for wandering on the surface of a planet.</p><p>&ldquo;A Life Pod,&rdquo; Pepper marked the note\nwith her caption. &ldquo;Web Skin Graft and Demographic Fluctuations. Friday,\nmark them as internal, family grade. Include Peter in the family authorisation\ngroup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s already in it, Pep,&rdquo; Tony\ninformed her softly and saw her eyebrows rise, just a smidgen.<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot of work,&rdquo; she stretched the display to show all three\nmain documents and additional pieces that Friday had visualised as post-it\nnotes all around them. &ldquo;He must have been up all night, silly\nboy&hellip;!&rdquo;</p><p>And all of this based solely on listening to the\nAI feeding him nearly random choice of data and him dictating the observations\nhe had theorised on in his mind. A true exercise in thought experiment. And the\ncode! He had to dictate the code&hellip;!<br />\n&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been very interested in medicine before,&rdquo; he frowned at\nthe display. &ldquo;His regen factor makes him rather wary of normal\ndoctors.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been stuck in there for weeks now, even if unconscious. He might\nhave heard them talking about it often enough. Maybe something filtered in when\nhe was in the coma. They say people hear a lot when they are like this, in\nfact.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;A message from Stephen Strange, boss.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Read it, Friday.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;'I need someone to tell that boy to stop trying so hard, or I will break\nhis scrawny neck. Other than that, there are several pieces of diagnostic\nequipment we could use and Shuri hadn&rsquo;t had time to procure. List attached.&rsquo;\nand there is the list, boss.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Find if we have anything from the file in our storages, get it delivered\nto the Embassy. Anything else, order, barter for or steal. Just get it\ndone.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Boss, a message from Peter Parker.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Read it!&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;'I&rsquo;m feeling better now. Sorry to worry you, Mr Stark. I&rsquo;ll try to be\nless trouble in the future.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\nHe swore, trying to rein in his temper.<br />\n&ldquo;We have to do something with this, Pepper.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;With this what? And what do you mean?&rdquo;<br />\nHe turned her and enveloped her in an all-encompassing hug.<br />\n&ldquo;This all. All this shit that happened around us in the last few weeks.\nThat kid. I mean - he says he is sorry he is sick&hellip;! Did I ever give him a\nreason to think I&rsquo;d be mad if he was less than perfect? Yes, I expected stuff\nfrom him, I still will. But I&rsquo;m not expecting him to be super-superhuman! At\nthis point, I&rsquo;ll settle for 'alive and in working condition&rsquo;, we can deal with\neverything else later. And I have to find some way for him to slow down a bit. Just\na bit.&rdquo;<br />\nShe hummed and pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of his mouth.<br />\n&ldquo;You are a great father, Tony,&rdquo; she sighed, leaning back in the tight\ncircle of his arms.<br />\n&ldquo;I think Morgan would mostly agree with you. Well, unless it comes to\nspinach. I&rsquo;m a very, very bad father when spinach shows on the table.&rdquo;<br />\nShe smiled, a bit weakly, and shook her head.<br />\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean Morgan, love.&rdquo;<br />\nHe frowned fiercely and looked down at her flat stomach with a questioning\nface.<br />\n&ldquo;No, I am most certainly <i>not</i>,\nyou genius. And before you start speculating and overthinking, I meant\nPeter.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;P-Peter&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off as she freed herself from his suddenly\nloose hold and pressed another kiss to his lips. &ldquo;What&hellip; how&hellip;?\nWhy?&rdquo;<br />\nPepper looked at him from over her reading glasses.<br />\n&ldquo;Stop being obtuse, Tony. It doesn&rsquo;t suit you.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;But, Pep&hellip; I never&hellip; I mean, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I know. He is not yours, Tony, and both you and he are quite conscious of\nthat fact. And that&rsquo;s perfectly OK. But you can&rsquo;t deny that you just want to\ntake care of him. That he is a nice, well-mannered, reasonably self-assured\nyoung man with a great potential for career in the same industry as you work on\n- everything that you could have asked for in an apprentice. Or a son.&rdquo;<br />\nHe shook his head weakly.<br />\n&ldquo;And you do see how he looks at you for approval - how he listens to\neverything you tell him?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;If he had listened to me more, he would not have found himself on that blasted\nplanet&hellip;!&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;And both you and Stephen would not have survived the way there, because it was\nPeter&rsquo;s idea to space that alien, right? You&rsquo;ve told me so many times how quick\nhe was on his feet and how useful he was in action. Don&rsquo;t you think it deserves\nsome appreciation?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;If he had stayed home&hellip;!&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;d not be here to argue with me,&rdquo; she cut him off swiftly. &ldquo;He worships\nyou, Tony. And I like him, you know. As in, if he had been your actual kid from\nsome previous marriage, I&rsquo;d try to be the best stepmother possible to him. He\nisn&rsquo;t and I can&rsquo;t but I&rsquo;m just saying.&rdquo;</p><p>He snorted at the absurdity of the idea.</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty years ago I was a blindingly\ninconsiderate, terrifyingly unreliable and astonishingly personally\nirresponsible person. And very, very much of a dick. I&rsquo;m sorry, Pep, but I was.\nHad I managed to produce a kid in these days, I would have messed him up so\nthoroughly the theoretical mother would have moved to Europe to avoid me. Now,\nPeter is a gift, in a way. I&rsquo;m getting him preconfigured. He has been set on\nthe best possible course by his uncle Ben and aunt May and he keeps to the\nstraight and narrow under her eye. All the influence I may have on him is&hellip;\nlimited. Thankfully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Self-flagellating again. I will ask Friday\nto set up alerts when you do this. You wouldn&rsquo;t have been a bad father, Tony.\nMaybe a bit eccentric. Spoiling your offspring a lot. Probably using inadequate\nlanguage. And yes, I know where Morgan learns all these swearwords and it&rsquo;s not\nfrom Happy. You&rsquo;d probably fail a lot,&rdquo; she combed away the stray curl\nfrom his forehead and he leaned into that touch, closing his eyes. &ldquo;But\nthen they&rsquo;d love you. The way Peter does. You are filling in some hole in his\nlife and he is filling in a hole in yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Morgan&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper grabbed his face and forced him to look\nat her, reminding him how strong these deceptively slim fingers were.</p><p>&ldquo;I know and you know that Morgan will\nalways be our priority,&rdquo; she said sternly. &ldquo;But we both also know\nthat forty five is <i>not</i> the optimum\ntime to have your first kid. We are both old parents, Tony. Peter is the kid\nyou should have had, if not for the way your life had been&hellip; meddled\nwith.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pep,&rdquo; he tried to interrupt her, but\nshe shushed him.</p><p>&ldquo;You would have been thirty-one when he was\nborn. Thirty-five when he started preschool. Forty when he needed your help\nwith a science project. And forty-five when he had his first crush. And you\nwould have been there for him. And if not for the general fuckuppery happening\nin your life, so would have your parents. And whatever you say about your\nfather, imagine him having to deal with someone as unbearably cute as Peter\nmust have been at ten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have had you,&rdquo; he\nmanaged to say finally. &ldquo;Or Morgan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nbut you do have us,&rdquo; she countered. &ldquo;You have us, but right now, you\ncan also have Peter. You only have to talk to him properly. Tell him he is\nimportant not because of what he can give to the company, but because he\nhimself is important. And that means he has to take care of himself and not\nrisk his health like this.&rdquo;</p><p>He swallowed and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; he croaked, his throat\ncompletely choked with all these uncomfortable emotions that Pepper had managed\nto stir in him. &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll talk to him.&rdquo;</p><p>He reached for the water he had left on the\nshelf and greedily sucked out a mouthful.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I will go to him myself and\nask if he wants you to adopt him.&rdquo;</p><p>Heroically, he managed not to spray her with\nsaid mouthful.</p><p>&ldquo;Pep&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a drastic measure, yes, but one I\nam willing to apply. Unless you manage to talk to him in the next two weeks. Counting from now.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh, shit.</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m11ThvfqEUttsb1G9K6aNHA\" target=\"_blank\">@all-the-fangeekiness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a></i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m tagging based on previous chapters interactions, if you want me to remove you from the list, let me know.

Although that was most likely the reason he wasn\u2019t dead yet, it was really annoying at school and in public. He\u2019d look like an absolute idiot. There\u2019d be a crowd just walking forwards normally, and then there\u2019d be him. He looked like he was five playing jump over the cracks. Some people would say he looked like he was dancing through the crowds, but those were only people that liked him. As annoying as it was though, it had never really gotten him into trouble (I mean, that is what it was there to prevent) some teasing by Flash, but no one else had noticed, including Mr. Stark and the rest of the Avengers.
