This is a sequel to the story I wrote that is called No-One But You (Only The Good Die Young)</p>\n<p>It specifically follows the Vishanti trio. Tony Stark, Dr. Stephen Strange, and Steve Rogers. If you haven&rsquo;t read the first fic, haven&rsquo;t reached the part in the story with the Vishanti, or if don&rsquo;t know what that is in the Marvel Universe, please don&rsquo;t fret.</p>\n<p>I will provide you a fic that really doesn&rsquo;t need the previous one. It will stand alone. There will be explained references, but I will provide context. The end of the first fic really leaves the three main characters in a world and a journey that is completely separate.

A small, frustrated sigh escaped him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still sore about that&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no <i>shit</i>,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cSince you can go\nbother other people, why don\u2019t you go ahead and do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, tough.\u201d Tony scowled. \u201cI\u2019m in a life-or-death situation\noutside of this dream, and I doubt anything you tell me can make a difference.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s spite burned, but was far from unforgiving.</p><p>There was still a flicker in his eyes, which asked <i>Why? Why\ndid you do it? Why me?</i></p><p>It told Stephen that Tony needed time.</p><p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Stephen assured him. &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll\nforget we ever talked when you wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Tony could ask what he meant, he vanished, leaving\nTony to see the rest of his dream through.</p><p>***</p><p>But time was something Stephen didn\u2019t have in abundance. He\nhad to hurry it along somehow.</p><p>He had to set the scene.</p><p>The last time they spoke, in the real world, Tony was in a broken\nship, with a daughter of Thanos, millions of light years away from Earth.</p><p>The barely-moving derelict\u2019s supplies were running out. The daughter\nof Thanos, not human, could barely understand Tony\u2019s need for human contact at\nthat bleak, desperate moment.</p><p>All this, Stephen learned by observing Tony as he dreamed of\nsoft beds, cheeseburgers, coffee, friends\u2019 laughter, and the warm embrace of the\nwoman he wanted to marry.</p><p>In the dream dimension, Stephen couldn\u2019t see into Tony\u2019s\nthoughts, but he could see Tony\u2019s desires and fears.</p><p>Tony was afraid he wouldn\u2019t see Earth again.</p><p>Deathly afraid.</p><p>Knowing that helped Stephen figure out what to do.</p><p>So the next time he and Tony spoke, it was in the premises\nof a cozy lakeside cabin, facing out into the water.</p><p>The house wasn\u2019t familiar to Tony. Not yet. But when he\nmaterialized on the porch in his dream, he took to the place instantly.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve redecorated,\u201d he remarked, clearly impressed. \u201cThis\nplace isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know, you chose it.\u201d Stephen caught himself and\nadded, \u201cWell&hellip;<i>will</i> choose it. And it isn\u2019t actually you, but Ms. Potts who\u2019ll\nbe doing the choosing. It\u2019ll take you the better part of a year to warm up to\nit, but you\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>Tony said nothing. He was looking out into the placid water.\nStephen looked out of it, as well.</p><p>\u201cThis was - is - will be - your favorite spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you how <i>weird</i> you are?\u201d</p><p>Stephen didn\u2019t miss the acid in Tony\u2019s voice. But he chose\nto ignore it.</p><p>\u201cThink of this as a vacation house. A\nplace where you can recover.\u201d He continued slowly, \u201cI know that I left you in a&hellip;difficult\nplace.\u201d</p><p>Tony snorted. \u201cA difficult place\u201d was a hell of a euphemism\nfor \u201cfloating in space with fast-depleting resources and no hope of rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need your strength, so it\u2019s important that you rest,\u201d\nStephen said, with undisguised warmth. \u201cWe\u2019ll have time to talk later.\u201d</p><p>Tony could have had a comeback to that, but he was tired&hellip;so\ntired. He was often tired in real life, but he couldn\u2019t disguise it in his\ndreams.</p><p>\n\nAnd\nthe man who walked his dreams, who could see what he hid inside of them, left\nhim quietly to recuperate. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>[tbc]<br/></p>",

Grinning, he watched Loki turn red in his face and hid it behind his book. &ldquo;Seems to be a no. Do you want to give it a try?&rdquo; Tony asked, &ldquo;Certainly not.\u201c, Loki returned. &quot;What? How can you miss such a chance? That&rsquo;s the most exciting thing in the world. Imagine&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;No. I certainly don&rsquo;t imagine anything. Can&rsquo;t you keep your terrible thoughts for yourself even once?&rdquo; Loki asked and closed his book so loudly, that even Clint was startled at the next table.  </p><p>&ldquo;What did I miss?&rdquo; he asked in wonder and looked around. &ldquo;Go back to sleep.&rdquo; Tony laughed. &ldquo;See you tonight for the barbecue.&rdquo; Loki said goodbye and left the library. &ldquo;You did good, Stark.&rdquo;, said Natascha. &ldquo;What do I have to do with it, if the princess is so uptight?&rdquo; Tony asked and looked at the redhead. &ldquo;You know how he is. In front of Steve you don&rsquo;t make jokes like that all the time,&rdquo; Bruce said. &ldquo;What is he not doing in front of me?\u201c Steve asked and sat next to Bruce. &quot;Hey Steve. Tony had to get on Loki&rsquo;s nerves again.&rdquo; Natascha said. &ldquo;Where is my brother?&rdquo; Thor asked and looked around. &ldquo;Probably on his way home,&rdquo; Tony explained. &ldquo;Then I better catch up with him, otherwise he&rsquo;ll have to run. See you tonight, friends?&rdquo; asked the blonde with a smile. &ldquo;Of course, keep the beer cold.&rdquo; Tony grinned, Thor nodded and jogged out of the library. &ldquo;How can these two be related?&rdquo;, Tony asked and drove through his hair.  </p><p>&ldquo;Today you&rsquo;re particularly tiring again, has anyone ever told you that?&rdquo; Clint asked and drove through his face. &ldquo;Not today yet. Would you like to do me a favor?&rdquo; Tony asked laughing. &ldquo;Is there finally quiet here? This is still a place of peace and quiet,&rdquo; hissed the librarian and looked at Tony angrily. &ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Bloom. He&rsquo;ll be as quiet as a mouse from now on. I promise.&rdquo; Steve smiled. &ldquo;Good. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re welcome to go.&rdquo; Nodded the old woman and left the table. </p><p>&ldquo;Old witch.&rdquo; Tony grumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m leaving now, too. Clint, will you come with me?&rdquo;, Natascha asked and packed up her things. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he nodded and also admitted everything. Together they disappeared from the library. &ldquo;Should I take you with me later?&rdquo;, Tony asked and looked at Steve and Bruce. &ldquo;Bucky picks me up. He&rsquo;s probably waiting for me,&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;All right. Should I take you with me, Bruce?&rdquo; Tony asked, &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s not too much of a detour for you, I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; Bruce nodded. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; nodded Tony.  </p><p>At 19 o'clock the friends met in front of Thor&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not the only ones now, are we?&rdquo; Natascha asked. &ldquo;I think Thor invited more people,&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;I hope so. I don&rsquo;t want to be in the same room with his parents. You know my allergy to parents,&rdquo; laughed Tony, &ldquo;At some point, maybe not today or tomorrow, but at some point in our life, this man will grow up,&rdquo; said Natascha. &ldquo;You have too much hope Tasha,&rdquo; Clint laughed. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; grinned the redhead. &ldquo;If you stand out there any longer, you&rsquo;ll grow roots,&rdquo; Loki&rsquo;s voice sounded from the front door. Tony looked at him and swallowed inconspicuously. Normally Loki looked really good. The black-haired guy was one of the few students who could wear the school uniform. But now? That was a walking sin. &ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo; Natascha asked and pulled him out of his thoughts. &ldquo;Hm? Yes, sure,&rdquo; Tony nodded and followed his friends. &ldquo;Good to see you,&rdquo; Natascha greeted the younger man. &ldquo;Me too. You look good,&rdquo; Loki smiled. &ldquo;I can only return the compliment. Is there any special occasion?&rdquo; she asked with a smile. &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s how I dress normally &rdquo; Loki smiled. &ldquo;We should meet much more often,&rdquo; Natascha laughed and entered the house. &ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Loki nodded and looked at him with his poisonous green eyes. &ldquo;Loki,&rdquo; said Tony smiling. &ldquo;My brother is waiting for you.&rdquo; Loki said and closed the door behind Tony. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Tony asked&hellip; &ldquo;His&hellip; friends don&rsquo;t believe him that there is another creature next to him on this planet that can empty several bottles in a row without getting alcohol poisoning directly,&rdquo; Loki said and rolled his eyes. &ldquo;All right. Then I&rsquo;ll show these people how good I am,&rdquo; Tony laughed and disappeared into the garden.  </p><p>&ldquo;My friends. May I introduce you. These are Fandral, Volstagg, Hogun and Sif. They came all the way from Norway to enjoy the holidays together with us,&rdquo; beamed Thor. &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; grinned Tony. Loki sighed quietly, then he sat on one of the couches. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Loki?&rdquo;, Bruce  asked and looked at Thor. &ldquo;My brother still can&rsquo;t stand the hot summer.,&rdquo; Thor laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Loki could romp around in the snow for hours, but as soon as it got anywhere near warm, he hid in the basement.&rdquo; laughed Hogun. Tony turned away from the group and looked at Loki. The younger one sat on the couch and stared into the area. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me.&rdquo; Tony said and went to Loki.  </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to annoy me, too, Stark?&rdquo; Loki asked and looked at him reproachfully. &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m just worried. If the heat doesn&rsquo;t get you, you shouldn&rsquo;t be sitting in the evening sun either. At least not directly.\u201c, said Tony. </p><p>\u201eThank you. But I know how long I can stay in the sun without anything happening to me,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to help,&rdquo; Tony raised his hands defensively.  </p><p>And he knew that in a few hours Loki probably wouldn&rsquo;t be so fit. It had always been similar with his mother. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your help. And now please return to the others. I don&rsquo;t want to have to endure Thor as well,&rdquo; Loki said and closed his eyes. &ldquo;As you like. But I don&rsquo;t want to have to tell you later that I told you. Drink a lot&rsquo;, Tony said and got up from the second couch.  </p><p>During the evening Tony watched the black haired one. Not just out of worry, no. Loki had a more than pretty butt in his pants and Tony imagined what it would be like to peel the younger one out of it. &quot;Stop undressing him.\u201c, Natascha hissed and flicked in front of his face. &quot;Tasha, let a man have a little fun,&rdquo; moaned Tony annoyed. &ldquo;You know what Thor is like when it comes to Loki. I don&rsquo;t fancy a fight because you adore his brother,&rdquo; Natascha said. Tony twisted his eyes and drove his way through his hair. Natascha was right. Thor would probably kill for Loki. Even if Loki didn&rsquo;t want to admit it, Thor loved his younger brother more than anything. &ldquo;Did we understand each other?&rdquo; Natascha asked again, with a little bit more pressure. &ldquo;Holy word of honor. If I break it, I&rsquo;ll give you my car.&rdquo; Promised Tony. &ldquo;Give me the key, if possible. You won&rsquo;t be able to keep this promise for long anyway,&rdquo; Natascha said. &ldquo;Have a little more trust in me,&rdquo; Tony laughed.  </p><p>The later it became, the more alcohol flowed. Thor, Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg only staggered around. Steve, Bucky and Bruce had already disappeared again. Clint and Natascha would also leave any moment. Only Tony and Loki remained. But he hadn&rsquo;t seen the black-haired guy for half an hour. &ldquo;Tony, my friend,&rdquo; Thor slurred and slapped his hand on his shoulders. Silently howling, Tony flinched. &ldquo;Wow, slow down, big boy,&rdquo; he said and looked at the blond giant. &ldquo;My brother, do you know where he is?&rdquo; Thor asked and looked around. &ldquo;No. Should I look for him? You probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to leave the property,&rdquo; Tony said and put the beer bottle on the table next to him. &ldquo;My brother would be happy if it was you who found him,&rdquo; Thor laughed. &ldquo;Hm! Loki likes you, Stark,&rdquo; Fandral slurred and stumbled over his own feet. &ldquo;Fandral! That was a secret! Princess Loki will only hate us even more,&rdquo; laughed Sif and leaned on the table. She probably didn&rsquo;t care that she just outlined a beer bottle. Just like Tony. He didn\u2019t care.  </p><p>Were they serious? Should Loki really like someone like him? They had only made that up. As drunk as the two were. &ldquo;You should go to bed. I&rsquo;m looking for Loki,&rdquo; said Tony and entered the house.  </p><p>&ldquo;Loki? Are you in there?&rdquo; Tony asked and knocked on Loki&rsquo;s room. When no answer came, he opened the door a bit, but found the room empty. That was the first time he was in Loki&rsquo;s room.  </p><p>In general, it was the first time he was in Loki&rsquo;s home. The last few years he had always been in Miami during the summer and had no time to attend Thor&rsquo;s parties. </p><p>Carefully he entered the dark room and looked around. He couldn&rsquo;t see much, so he turned on the little night lamp next to the bed. The room lit up and Tony was blinded for a moment. But his eyes quickly got used to the brightness.  </p><p>Tony knew that Loki was paying close attention to cleanliness and order. But this room seemed almost sterile. There was hardly anything personal. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s usual with you, but with us you ask permission before you enter someone else&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; Loki said behind him. Shocked, Tony turned around. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;, Tony got the words stuck in his throat. Loki stood in front of him, only dressed in a boxer shorts and a towel around his neck. His hair was still wet and the water was dripping on his flawless upper body. &ldquo;Did I have something in my face or did you swallow your tongue, Stark?&rdquo; Loki ripped him from his thoughts. &ldquo;No&hellip; I&hellip; excuse me. I was just worried. You were suddenly gone and&hellip;&rdquo;, Tony started. &ldquo;So you thought you could come into my bedroom and do what exactly?\u201c, Loki asked with his eyebrow raised. &quot;Nothing. Loki I swear to you, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything. Just to see if everything was right. I promise,&rdquo; said Tony, &ldquo;Good. You have that now. As you can see, I am still alive. Would you please leave me alone now? I would like to sleep,&rdquo; Loki said and walked past him. He threw the towel on the chair and sat down on his bed.  </p><p>A few minutes passed until one of them stirred. &ldquo;Loki I&hellip; watch out, I&rsquo;m really bad at this. That&rsquo;s why I hope you can forgive me,&rdquo; Tony laughed nervously, &ldquo;It seems liked you don&rsquo;t break into other people&rsquo;s bedrooms very often,&rdquo; Loki said amusedly. &ldquo;Loki&hellip; at least give me the chance to explain myself. And finally believe me, I didn&rsquo;t want to snoop around here,&rdquo; said Tony, desperate. Loki looked at him unimpressed. Then he leaned back on his hands and looked at Tony. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; Loki said. But Tony&rsquo;s mouth resembled a desert at that moment. Loki was pure eroticism in his eyes. His long legs. His muscles on his arms and belly. The light skin. The long black hair. The green eyes. Loki was like a Greek god.  </p><p>&ldquo;Stark? I&rsquo;ll give you two minutes before&hellip;&rdquo; But Loki couldn&rsquo;t finish the sentence. Tony pushed him on his back and sat down on his lap. Confused Loki looked at him. &ldquo;Cat got your tongue?&rdquo; Tony asked and grabbed Loki&rsquo;s chin. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Loki smiled. Tony grinned. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t change that tonight.&rdquo; Tony said and bent down to kiss him. Panting Loki returned the kiss and clawed himself into Tony&rsquo;s shirt.  </p><p>The two men separated and stared at each other. &ldquo;I fell in love with you. And that&rsquo;s the problem. I love you and I know you don&rsquo;t. And when I wake up tomorrow morning, this will never happen again. Or I&rsquo;m dead because you&rsquo;re sicing your brother on me,&rdquo; Tony said and stroked a strand of Loki&rsquo;s reddened face. &ldquo;Stark, if you think so, maybe you should leave my room right now.&rdquo; Loki said and looked at him. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;, Tony straightened up. &ldquo;Do you really think I would allow any guy who&rsquo;d run along to kiss me? Not to mention touching me,&rdquo; Loki asked. Tony&rsquo;s face lit up immediately. &ldquo;You like me,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t exaggerate. I accept you,&rdquo; Loki twisted his eyes. Tony laughed quietly. &ldquo;Just admit it and say you like me. That&rsquo;s all I expect from you,&rdquo; laughed Tony, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re rubbing yourself against me all the time? Because you don&rsquo;t expect anything from me&rdquo;, Loki asked with a grin. &ldquo;A man just has needs. And let&rsquo;s be honest, you haven&rsquo;t shown me yet that it would bother you if I did,&rdquo; grinned Tony. Loki straightened up. &ldquo;What would you do if I showed you it bothers me,&rdquo; Loki asked and kissed Tony&rsquo;s jaw. &ldquo;Then I would get up now&hellip; ah&hellip; and go,&rdquo; Tony replied honestly. If Loki didn&rsquo;t want to, Tony wouldn&rsquo;t force him to do anything. &ldquo;What would you do if I wanted to,&rdquo; Loki asked and bit Tony gently in the throat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just ask, find out,&rdquo; Tony smiled and pulled Loki&rsquo;s head by the hair to his neck. Grinning, Loki looked up at him. &ldquo;Then show me.&rdquo;  </p><p>Those were the words Tony needed. He pressed Loki into the mattress and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and started playing with the buttons of Tony&rsquo;s shirt. Carefully Tony licked Loki&rsquo;s lips, hoping he understood the hint and was glad the black haired man understood. Loki opened his lip and let Tony&rsquo;s tongue in. Then it seemed Loki had lost his patience and he tore the shirt open. The buttons landed on the floor, where they would remain until tomorrow morning. &ldquo;Are we impatient?&rdquo; Tony grinned and broke away from Loki. &ldquo;As if you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Tony gave back and drove Loki over his neck, down to his nipples. Frightened, the black-haired man gasped and Tony had to grin. </p><p>\u201eBrother? Are you alright?&ldquo;, Thor&rsquo;s voice sounded behind the door and Tony immediately froze. Panic spread into Loki&rsquo;s eyes. &quot;Answer him,&rdquo; whispered Tony. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; called Loki. &ldquo;I just wanted to make sure you were okay,&rdquo; Thor said. &ldquo;Princess Loki, did your knight find you?&rdquo; Fandral laughed and Volstagg hit the wall. Loki twisted his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, thank you very much for asking. I&rsquo;d like to sleep now if it&rsquo;s not too much to ask,&rdquo; Loki said. Tony grinned and slipped between Loki&rsquo;s legs. &ldquo;What are you going to&hellip;?&rdquo; Loki whispered hoarse. &ldquo;Did you at least have fun? You seemed to understand yourself really well with Natascha,&rdquo; Thor asked.  </p><p>Loki needed a few moments. Tony grinned at him and pulled down his boxer shorts. The cool evening air caressed his body and he got goose bumps. &ldquo;Brother?&rdquo;, Thor sounded worried. But Loki couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off Tony. His brilliant eyes looked up at him. Then he opened his mouth and Loki could never have got ready for the next one. A shiver ran over his body and a soft whoop escaped. &ldquo;Brother? Is everything all right?&rdquo; Thor asked worriedly. &ldquo;Ye-Yes! All&rsquo;s well! Thor&hellip; I beg you&hellip; leave me in&hellip; leave me in peace,&rdquo; Loki gasped as he felt Tony licking over his erection. &ldquo;Is Loki having sex?&rdquo; laughed Sif. &ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; Thor thundered. Finally Tony took Loki completely in his mouth. It was hard for the younger one to be quiet. But as long as Thor was out there, it wasn&rsquo;t safe. Loki bit his lip not to moan. Clung into his blanket and turned under Tony&rsquo;s touch. &ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; he gasped, as quietly as he could. A suppressed moaning could be heard and Tony&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with lust and desire. &ldquo;Sleep well, brother. We&rsquo;ll talk tomorrow, at breakfast,&rdquo; said Thor, and then you could only hear shuffling footsteps. A stone fell from Loki&rsquo;s heart. Tony appeared in front of his face. His lips shone and a happy smile adorned his face. &ldquo;You&hellip; are crazy,&rdquo; Loki cursed. &ldquo;What? Come on, you liked it. The thrill. I noticed you getting harder and harder,&rdquo; Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and closed her eyes. He tasted himself. Then he pushed Tony away and looked at him. &ldquo;I want to feel you&hellip; in me,&rdquo; Loki admitted.  </p><p>&ldquo;Everything you wish for, darling,&rdquo; Tony said and stroked his neck. The place where he had bitten was red and Loki would have to explain tomorrow where the hickey came from. This redness was so blatantly prominent on the white skin that Tony couldn&rsquo;t avert his gaze. &ldquo;You belong to me,&rdquo; he whispered hoarse. &ldquo;And you to me,&rdquo; Loki gave back. Tony nodded. Then he bent down and bit Loki again. This time in the shoulder and a quiet howl could be heard. Music in Tony&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered and licked apologetically over the bite on the shoulder. &ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Loki gasped. Tony looked at him. &ldquo;Say that again&hellip;&rdquo; he said and looked at Loki. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; please&hellip;&rdquo; Loki begged. &ldquo;Of course. Where do you have lubricants and condoms,&rdquo; Tony asked. &ldquo;Top drawer,&rdquo; Loki gasped and watched him. Tony nodded and bent over him to get to the bedside table. &ldquo;You seem to be well prepared,&rdquo; grinned Tony. Loki&rsquo;s cheeks turned red. &ldquo;I&hellip; had hopes,&rdquo; Loki returned. Tony looked at him. Was Loki an angel?  </p><p>&ldquo;Turn on your stomach,&rdquo; Tony whispered and Loki took a few seconds to follow the order. Embarrassed, he pressed his face into his pillow and presented Tony with his ass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to eat you right now,&rdquo; Tony murmured and kissed Loki&rsquo;s ass. Hot shame rolled over him as Tony spoke these words. Loki knew exactly what he meant, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready for that yet. It had already cost him a lot of effort to present himself like that to Tony. Would Tony still kiss him then&hellip; Loki didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. It got hot and cold at the same time. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; Tony asked worriedly. &ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo;, Loki gave back and looked over his shoulder to him. &ldquo;If I hurt you, let me know, okay?&rdquo; Tony smiled. Loki just nodded embarrassed. &ldquo;And please, let me hear you,&rdquo; whispered Tony, kissing Loki&rsquo;s back and circling Loki&rsquo;s most private spot with his middle finger.  </p><p>Loki whimpered in front of him and clawed himself into one of the many pillows while Tony pressed against the tight muscle ring. &ldquo;T-Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Loki gasped. &ldquo;Shh&hellip; it&rsquo;s all good,&rdquo; Tony whispered and finally felt the warmth around his finger.  </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing fine, baby&hellip;&rdquo; Tony assured and crawled over Loki&rsquo;s back. Carefully Tony pulled his finger back and watched Loki&rsquo;s reaction. The younger one trembled tense. Then Tony penetrated him again. &ldquo;You are so tight&hellip;&rdquo; he gasped and paused briefly. He wanted to enjoy it and prepare himself when he finally came to the main course. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; please&hellip;&rdquo;, Loki pleaded and pushed towards him. &ldquo;Slowly. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you,&rdquo; Tony whispered and moved his finger faster.  </p><p>Loki closed his eyes and enjoyed what Tony did to him. And then he felt a second finger and immediately his body tightened. &ldquo;Baby&hellip; all well&hellip;&rdquo; Tony smiled confidently. Loki nodded and closed his eyes. But the feeling didn&rsquo;t get any better. The tension did not diminish. It felt wrong and yet so right at the same time. His body and mind worked against his emotions. &ldquo;Loki&hellip; Hey&hellip; Stop thinking,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;T-That you say so easily&hellip;&rdquo; Loki muttered. &ldquo;Turn on your back,&rdquo; Tony said.  </p><p>Carefully Loki looked up at Tony. Had he disappointed him? Would Tony go now and leave him alone? &ldquo;Whatever you&rsquo;re thinking about with your little head, stop it. It won&rsquo;t do you any good if you go crazy now,&rdquo; Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and felt the familiar finger inside him. Loki lay there completely relaxed and watched Tony, who worked his neck with his tongue and bit him several times with his teeth. Loki had the feeling he was going crazy. His whole body was electrified and he couldn&rsquo;t concentrate on anything. &ldquo;Well you see&hellip;&rdquo; Tony smiled and ripped Loki out of his mind. &ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo; Loki looked at him confused, then he felt it. Tony had pushed a second finger into it and Loki hadn&rsquo;t noticed. His body tightened briefly, but this time Loki didn&rsquo;t allow it. He breathed deeply and smiled at Tony.  </p><p>Tony began to move his fingers into Loki&rsquo;s narrow hole. Initially slow and cautious, not much later and he found a faster rhythm. He spread his fingers to get Loki used to something much bigger waiting for him. The black-haired man lay in front of him, whining quietly and pleasurably, his eyes closed and desperately clinging to his blanket. At that moment Tony realized that he could never let Loki go again. Loki belonged to him and no other person had the right to touch or even look at this man. &ldquo;Tony&hellip;?&rdquo; Loki whispered and reached out his hand to him. Tony was torn from his thoughts when Loki&rsquo;s cold fingers touched his cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m there baby&hellip;&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I&hellip; want to feel you&hellip; please Tony&hellip; don&rsquo;t keep me waiting&hellip;&rdquo; Loki pleaded and looked at him desperately. &ldquo;Of course not, baby,&rdquo; Tony said and pulled his fingers out of Loki.  </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; Tony asked and looked at him. Loki nodded. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Tony smiled and penetrated him. Loki opened his eyes and opened his mouth, but before a scream could escape, Tony put his hand on his mouth. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any uninvited guests&hellip;&rdquo; he smiled. Loki breathed deeply and closed his mouth again. Tony took his hand away and looked down at Loki. &ldquo;You are so beautiful,&rdquo; Tony whispered, briefly fearing that his voice would fail or he would come immediately. Loki was so tight and so perfect. Never before had he seen a more perfect being. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; please,&rdquo; Loki pleaded desperately. Finally there was movement and Tony slowly withdrew from Loki. He whimpered quietly as he felt the loss. But not for long and Tony pushed into him again.  </p><p>Loki clung to Tony and closed his eyes. He felt his orgasm. He felt it although it seemed like it was still miles away. &ldquo;Baby&hellip; relax&hellip;&rdquo; moaned Tony and sank on his arms. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; Loki&rsquo;s voice failed and he felt his orgasm. &ldquo;Come for me&hellip; baby. Come for me. Say my name,&rdquo; moaned Tony and moved his hip more and more erratic and without any real rhythm. But Tony hit that one spot in Loki that made him see stars, that made his orgasm so much more. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Loki sobbed and clawed himself into Tony&rsquo;s naked torso. And that was the moment when Tony came. Together they fell over the cliff.  </p><p>Loki lay under him and flinched. Tony didn&rsquo;t want to free himself yet. Tony wanted to enjoy the narrowness and the warmth. &ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered quietly. &ldquo;Not yet&hellip; I&rsquo;m not ready to wake up from this dream&hellip;&rdquo; Loki whispered hoarse. Tony laughed quietly. &ldquo;Anything you want&hellip;&rdquo; he murmured and kissed Loki&rsquo;s sweaty forehead.  </p><p>Loki opened his eyes and saw Tony above him. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a dream or&hellip;?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony smiled and straightened up. Loki already missed Tony&rsquo;s body and the man was not a meter away from him. &ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo; Tony asked and grabbed the handkerchiefs. Loki nodded and stared at the ceiling. His cheeks turned red when he realized he had given his virginity to Tony Stark. &ldquo;What dirty thoughts do you have? Enlighten me,&rdquo; Tony said as he wiped the cold sperm from Loki&rsquo;s abdomen. Goose bumps spread over his body. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well&hellip;&rdquo; Loki smiled and leaned on his forearms.  </p><p>The two fell asleep together. Tony Stark was the only source of heat he could ever really accept. And the heat his body radiated was pleasant.  </p><p>Thor awoke early at noon with a hangover. Groaning, he rolled to his side and hit his alarm clock. Why did he always make the same mistakes when the others were there? Couldn&rsquo;t he even hold himself back?  </p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, darling,&rdquo; his mother smiled at him. &ldquo;Mother&hellip; good to see you. When did you come back?&rdquo; Thor asked surprised.  </p><p>&ldquo;This morning. Your father had a heart attack when he saw the garden. You should have breakfast and help him clean up,&rdquo; Frigga smiled. &ldquo;Of course. Let me just find something for the headaches,&rdquo; Thor nodded carefully. Every movement hurt. &ldquo;Morning&hellip;&rdquo; yawned Volstagg and sat down at the kitchen table. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Fandral greeted her. &ldquo;Hm&hellip;&rdquo; Sif sat down and dropped his head on her arms. &ldquo;Good morning, Miss Odinson,&rdquo; Hogun smiled. &ldquo;Please be quieter&hellip;&rdquo; moaned Fandral. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a hangover,&rdquo; Volstagg complained. &ldquo;Good morning to all of you,&rdquo; Frigga smiled and distributed the plates. &ldquo;Where is your brother?\u201c &quot;He&rsquo;s probably still asleep. He was still awake at three when we went to bed,&rdquo; said Thor.  </p><p>Loki stood in the bathroom staring at himself in the mirror. He would never be able to dismiss the bite marks and hickeys as mosquito bites. &ldquo;Come back&hellip;&rdquo; Tony groaned from his bedroom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you&hellip;&rdquo; Loki cursed and gave him an evil look. &ldquo;What? why?&rdquo; Tony asked and slowly got up. &ldquo;Did you look at me? I look like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Loki hissed and pointed to his neck and shoulders. &ldquo;Baby. You look wonderful. At least give me a good morning kiss. Yes? Please&rdquo;, Tony smiled and pulled Loki by his hips, between his legs. Loki wrapped his arms around Tony&rsquo;s neck and looked down at him. &ldquo;You explain this to my family,&rdquo; he murmured before Loki bent down and kissed him.  </p><p>Together they went down the stairs. &ldquo;My parents are already there,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;Should I rather disappear,&rdquo; Tony asked worriedly. &ldquo;No. You just have to pass Thor,&rdquo; Loki smiled and pulled him into the kitchen. &ldquo;Loki, my darling. Good to see you. And Tony. Thor hadn&rsquo;t even mentioned that you would spend the night here,&rdquo; Frigga smiled. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; Good morning first,&rdquo; Tony laughed nervously. Thor looked at them both and recognized the intertwined hands. &ldquo;Before you kill us, brother. Leave it alone. There is nothing to discuss,&rdquo; Loki noted dryly and sat down on the chair. He briefly pulled his face, but it was only Tony who noticed it. He laughed quietly and sat down next to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice that my sons are finally all happy,&rdquo; Frigga smiled. &ldquo;Not for long. How did you manage to destroy the whole garden within one evening? Please, don&rsquo;t answer this question. I can answer it myself. Frigga, my heart. Can I have a coffee, please? I don&rsquo;t think my back can take it anymore,&rdquo; Odin said and sat at the head of the table. &ldquo;Of course, my dear,&rdquo; Frigga smiled and put the cup in front of Odin.  </p><p>While Odin and Frigga unpacked their clothes, Thor, his friends, Loki and Tony disappeared in the garden to eliminate the chaos.  </p><p>&ldquo;Which of you idiots threw up in the pool, please?&rdquo; rumbled Thor. &ldquo;That was you, my dear Thor. After Tasha had made you one of her well-known mixtures,&rdquo; Tony laughed and hit Thor on the shoulder. &ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; grumbled Thor. &ldquo;What? The party or Natasha&rsquo;s mix?&rdquo; Loki smiled and picked up a plastic cup. &ldquo;Both. Brother, you are the sensible one of us. Please hold me off next time,&rdquo; said Thor, looking desperately at his younger brother. &ldquo;If only you would listen to me,&rdquo; Loki said and continued stuffing cups into the garbage bag.  </p><p>Together they cleaned up the garden as quickly as possible. And when the lawn was free of garbage and the vomit had disappeared from the pool, they all sat down on the benches and loungers. &ldquo;So you had sex yesterday,&rdquo; Sif grinned and looked at Tony, then at Loki. Loki twisted his eyes. &ldquo;Sif. I beg you,&rdquo; Thor said. There would be a lot more discussions, Loki knew that. &ldquo;What? I want to know! The ice princess has finally melted. How many people tried it at home and all failed. Either on you or they froze to death in the vast ice desert in which Loki&rsquo;s heart lies,&rdquo; Fandral said. &ldquo;Fandral, I beg you. Don&rsquo;t make these comparisons. I certainly wasn&rsquo;t an ice princess,&rdquo; Loki twisted his eyes. &ldquo;Oh no? And how would you describe yourself?&rdquo; the blonde grinned. &ldquo;Please no more Elsa jokes&rdquo;, laughed Tony. &ldquo;Elsa?&rdquo; Loki looked at him confused. &ldquo;You never saw Frozen? Oh baby, you really missed something,&rdquo; grinned Tony. &ldquo;I hate all of you,&rdquo; Loki twisted his eye.</p><p>The day ended as well as it had begun. Loki was happy. Thor hadn&rsquo;t killed anyone and Tony was the pure definition of love. So and no other way, the rest of his life would begin. Tony swore that to himself. </p><p><br/></p><p>Be free to spell any grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes. Like you know, my native Language is German. </p>",

Grinning, he watched Loki turn red in his face and hid it behind his book. \u201cSeems to be a no. Do you want to give it a try?\u201d Tony asked, \u201cCertainly not.\u201c, Loki returned. \"What? How can you miss such a chance? That\u2019s the most exciting thing in the world. Imagine\u2026\u201d \u201cNo. I certainly don\u2019t imagine anything. Can\u2019t you keep your terrible thoughts for yourself even once?\u201d Loki asked and closed his book so loudly, that even Clint was startled at the next table.  </p><p>\u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d he asked in wonder and looked around. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d Tony laughed. \u201cSee you tonight for the barbecue.\u201d Loki said goodbye and left the library. \u201cYou did good, Stark.\u201d, said Natascha. \u201cWhat do I have to do with it, if the princess is so uptight?\u201d Tony asked and looked at the redhead. \u201cYou know how he is. In front of Steve you don\u2019t make jokes like that all the time,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cWhat is he not doing in front of me?\u201c Steve asked and sat next to Bruce. \"Hey Steve. Tony had to get on Loki\u2019s nerves again.\u201d Natascha said. \u201cWhere is my brother?\u201d Thor asked and looked around. \u201cProbably on his way home,\u201d Tony explained. \u201cThen I better catch up with him, otherwise he\u2019ll have to run. See you tonight, friends?\u201d asked the blonde with a smile. \u201cOf course, keep the beer cold.\u201d Tony grinned, Thor nodded and jogged out of the library. \u201cHow can these two be related?\u201d, Tony asked and drove through his hair.  </p><p>\u201cToday you\u2019re particularly tiring again, has anyone ever told you that?\u201d Clint asked and drove through his face. \u201cNot today yet. Would you like to do me a favor?\u201d Tony asked laughing. \u201cIs there finally quiet here? This is still a place of peace and quiet,\u201d hissed the librarian and looked at Tony angrily. \u201cExcuse me, Miss Bloom. He\u2019ll be as quiet as a mouse from now on. I promise.\u201d Steve smiled. \u201cGood. Otherwise, you\u2019re welcome to go.\u201d Nodded the old woman and left the table. </p><p>\u201cOld witch.\u201d Tony grumbled. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. I\u2019m leaving now, too. Clint, will you come with me?\u201d, Natascha asked and packed up her things. \u201cOf course,\u201d he nodded and also admitted everything. Together they disappeared from the library. \u201cShould I take you with me later?\u201d, Tony asked and looked at Steve and Bruce. \u201cBucky picks me up. He\u2019s probably waiting for me,\u201d Steve said. \u201cAll right. Should I take you with me, Bruce?\u201d Tony asked, \u201cIf that\u2019s not too much of a detour for you, I\u2019d love to,\u201d Bruce nodded. \u201cAll right,\u201d nodded Tony.  </p><p>At 19 o'clock the friends met in front of Thor\u2019s house. \u201cBut we\u2019re not the only ones now, are we?\u201d Natascha asked. \u201cI think Thor invited more people,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI hope so. I don\u2019t want to be in the same room with his parents. You know my allergy to parents,\u201d laughed Tony, \u201cAt some point, maybe not today or tomorrow, but at some point in our life, this man will grow up,\u201d said Natascha. \u201cYou have too much hope Tasha,\u201d Clint laughed. \u201cI know,\u201d grinned the redhead. \u201cIf you stand out there any longer, you\u2019ll grow roots,\u201d Loki\u2019s voice sounded from the front door. Tony looked at him and swallowed inconspicuously. Normally Loki looked really good. The black-haired guy was one of the few students who could wear the school uniform. But now? That was a walking sin. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d Natascha asked and pulled him out of his thoughts. \u201cHm? Yes, sure,\u201d Tony nodded and followed his friends. \u201cGood to see you,\u201d Natascha greeted the younger man. \u201cMe too. You look good,\u201d Loki smiled. \u201cI can only return the compliment. Is there any special occasion?\u201d she asked with a smile. \u201cNo. That\u2019s how I dress normally \u201d Loki smiled. \u201cWe should meet much more often,\u201d Natascha laughed and entered the house. \u201cStark.\u201d Loki nodded and looked at him with his poisonous green eyes. \u201cLoki,\u201d said Tony smiling. \u201cMy brother is waiting for you.\u201d Loki said and closed the door behind Tony. \u201cWhy?\u201d Tony asked\u2026 \u201cHis\u2026 friends don\u2019t believe him that there is another creature next to him on this planet that can empty several bottles in a row without getting alcohol poisoning directly,\u201d Loki said and rolled his eyes. \u201cAll right. Then I\u2019ll show these people how good I am,\u201d Tony laughed and disappeared into the garden.  </p><p>\u201cMy friends. May I introduce you. These are Fandral, Volstagg, Hogun and Sif. They came all the way from Norway to enjoy the holidays together with us,\u201d beamed Thor. \u201cCool,\u201d grinned Tony. Loki sighed quietly, then he sat on one of the couches. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Loki?\u201d, Bruce  asked and looked at Thor. \u201cMy brother still can\u2019t stand the hot summer.,\u201d Thor laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Loki could romp around in the snow for hours, but as soon as it got anywhere near warm, he hid in the basement.\u201d laughed Hogun. Tony turned away from the group and looked at Loki. The younger one sat on the couch and stared into the area. \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d Tony said and went to Loki.  </p><p>\u201cDo you want to annoy me, too, Stark?\u201d Loki asked and looked at him reproachfully. \u201cHey, I\u2019m just worried. If the heat doesn\u2019t get you, you shouldn\u2019t be sitting in the evening sun either. At least not directly.\u201c, said Tony. </p><p>\u201eThank you. But I know how long I can stay in the sun without anything happening to me,\u201d Loki said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help,\u201d Tony raised his hands defensively.  </p><p>And he knew that in a few hours Loki probably wouldn\u2019t be so fit. It had always been similar with his mother. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. And now please return to the others. I don\u2019t want to have to endure Thor as well,\u201d Loki said and closed his eyes. \u201cAs you like. But I don\u2019t want to have to tell you later that I told you. Drink a lot\u2019, Tony said and got up from the second couch.  </p><p>During the evening Tony watched the black haired one. Not just out of worry, no. Loki had a more than pretty butt in his pants and Tony imagined what it would be like to peel the younger one out of it. \"Stop undressing him.\u201c, Natascha hissed and flicked in front of his face. \"Tasha, let a man have a little fun,\u201d moaned Tony annoyed. \u201cYou know what Thor is like when it comes to Loki. I don\u2019t fancy a fight because you adore his brother,\u201d Natascha said. Tony twisted his eyes and drove his way through his hair. Natascha was right. Thor would probably kill for Loki. Even if Loki didn\u2019t want to admit it, Thor loved his younger brother more than anything. \u201cDid we understand each other?\u201d Natascha asked again, with a little bit more pressure. \u201cHoly word of honor. If I break it, I\u2019ll give you my car.\u201d Promised Tony. \u201cGive me the key, if possible. You won\u2019t be able to keep this promise for long anyway,\u201d Natascha said. \u201cHave a little more trust in me,\u201d Tony laughed.  </p><p>The later it became, the more alcohol flowed. Thor, Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg only staggered around. Steve, Bucky and Bruce had already disappeared again. Clint and Natascha would also leave any moment. Only Tony and Loki remained. But he hadn\u2019t seen the black-haired guy for half an hour. \u201cTony, my friend,\u201d Thor slurred and slapped his hand on his shoulders. Silently howling, Tony flinched. \u201cWow, slow down, big boy,\u201d he said and looked at the blond giant. \u201cMy brother, do you know where he is?\u201d Thor asked and looked around. \u201cNo. Should I look for him? You probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to leave the property,\u201d Tony said and put the beer bottle on the table next to him. \u201cMy brother would be happy if it was you who found him,\u201d Thor laughed. \u201cHm! Loki likes you, Stark,\u201d Fandral slurred and stumbled over his own feet. \u201cFandral! That was a secret! Princess Loki will only hate us even more,\u201d laughed Sif and leaned on the table. She probably didn\u2019t care that she just outlined a beer bottle. Just like Tony. He didn\u2019t care.  </p><p>Were they serious? Should Loki really like someone like him? They had only made that up. As drunk as the two were. \u201cYou should go to bed. I\u2019m looking for Loki,\u201d said Tony and entered the house.  </p><p>\u201cLoki? Are you in there?\u201d Tony asked and knocked on Loki\u2019s room. When no answer came, he opened the door a bit, but found the room empty. That was the first time he was in Loki\u2019s room.  </p><p>In general, it was the first time he was in Loki\u2019s home. The last few years he had always been in Miami during the summer and had no time to attend Thor\u2019s parties. </p><p>Carefully he entered the dark room and looked around. He couldn\u2019t see much, so he turned on the little night lamp next to the bed. The room lit up and Tony was blinded for a moment. But his eyes quickly got used to the brightness.  </p><p>Tony knew that Loki was paying close attention to cleanliness and order. But this room seemed almost sterile. There was hardly anything personal. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s usual with you, but with us you ask permission before you enter someone else\u2019s room.\u201d Loki said behind him. Shocked, Tony turned around. \u201cI\u2026\u201d, Tony got the words stuck in his throat. Loki stood in front of him, only dressed in a boxer shorts and a towel around his neck. His hair was still wet and the water was dripping on his flawless upper body. \u201cDid I have something in my face or did you swallow your tongue, Stark?\u201d Loki ripped him from his thoughts. \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2026 excuse me. I was just worried. You were suddenly gone and\u2026\u201d, Tony started. \u201cSo you thought you could come into my bedroom and do what exactly?\u201c, Loki asked with his eyebrow raised. \"Nothing. Loki I swear to you, I didn\u2019t want to do anything. Just to see if everything was right. I promise,\u201d said Tony, \u201cGood. You have that now. As you can see, I am still alive. Would you please leave me alone now? I would like to sleep,\u201d Loki said and walked past him. He threw the towel on the chair and sat down on his bed.  </p><p>A few minutes passed until one of them stirred. \u201cLoki I\u2026 watch out, I\u2019m really bad at this. That\u2019s why I hope you can forgive me,\u201d Tony laughed nervously, \u201cIt seems liked you don\u2019t break into other people\u2019s bedrooms very often,\u201d Loki said amusedly. \u201cLoki\u2026 at least give me the chance to explain myself. And finally believe me, I didn\u2019t want to snoop around here,\u201d said Tony, desperate. Loki looked at him unimpressed. Then he leaned back on his hands and looked at Tony. \u201cThen let\u2019s get started,\u201d Loki said. But Tony\u2019s mouth resembled a desert at that moment. Loki was pure eroticism in his eyes. His long legs. His muscles on his arms and belly. The light skin. The long black hair. The green eyes. Loki was like a Greek god.  </p><p>\u201cStark? I\u2019ll give you two minutes before\u2026\u201d But Loki couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. Tony pushed him on his back and sat down on his lap. Confused Loki looked at him. \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d Tony asked and grabbed Loki\u2019s chin. \u201cNever,\u201d Loki smiled. Tony grinned. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t change that tonight.\u201d Tony said and bent down to kiss him. Panting Loki returned the kiss and clawed himself into Tony\u2019s shirt.  </p><p>The two men separated and stared at each other. \u201cI fell in love with you. And that\u2019s the problem. I love you and I know you don\u2019t. And when I wake up tomorrow morning, this will never happen again. Or I\u2019m dead because you\u2019re sicing your brother on me,\u201d Tony said and stroked a strand of Loki\u2019s reddened face. \u201cStark, if you think so, maybe you should leave my room right now.\u201d Loki said and looked at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d, Tony straightened up. \u201cDo you really think I would allow any guy who\u2019d run along to kiss me? Not to mention touching me,\u201d Loki asked. Tony\u2019s face lit up immediately. \u201cYou like me,\u201d he grinned. \u201cPlease don\u2019t exaggerate. I accept you,\u201d Loki twisted his eyes. Tony laughed quietly. \u201cJust admit it and say you like me. That\u2019s all I expect from you,\u201d laughed Tony, \u201cOh, that\u2019s why you\u2019re rubbing yourself against me all the time? Because you don\u2019t expect anything from me\u201d, Loki asked with a grin. \u201cA man just has needs. And let\u2019s be honest, you haven\u2019t shown me yet that it would bother you if I did,\u201d grinned Tony. Loki straightened up. \u201cWhat would you do if I showed you it bothers me,\u201d Loki asked and kissed Tony\u2019s jaw. \u201cThen I would get up now\u2026 ah\u2026 and go,\u201d Tony replied honestly. If Loki didn\u2019t want to, Tony wouldn\u2019t force him to do anything. \u201cWhat would you do if I wanted to,\u201d Loki asked and bit Tony gently in the throat. \u201cDon\u2019t just ask, find out,\u201d Tony smiled and pulled Loki\u2019s head by the hair to his neck. Grinning, Loki looked up at him. \u201cThen show me.\u201d  </p><p>Those were the words Tony needed. He pressed Loki into the mattress and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and started playing with the buttons of Tony\u2019s shirt. Carefully Tony licked Loki\u2019s lips, hoping he understood the hint and was glad the black haired man understood. Loki opened his lip and let Tony\u2019s tongue in. Then it seemed Loki had lost his patience and he tore the shirt open. The buttons landed on the floor, where they would remain until tomorrow morning. \u201cAre we impatient?\u201d Tony grinned and broke away from Loki. \u201cAs if you weren\u2019t,\u201d Loki said. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Tony gave back and drove Loki over his neck, down to his nipples. Frightened, the black-haired man gasped and Tony had to grin. </p><p>\u201eBrother? Are you alright?\u201c, Thor\u2019s voice sounded behind the door and Tony immediately froze. Panic spread into Loki\u2019s eyes. \"Answer him,\u201d whispered Tony. \u201cYes,\u201d called Loki. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay,\u201d Thor said. \u201cPrincess Loki, did your knight find you?\u201d Fandral laughed and Volstagg hit the wall. Loki twisted his eyes. \u201cYes, thank you very much for asking. I\u2019d like to sleep now if it\u2019s not too much to ask,\u201d Loki said. Tony grinned and slipped between Loki\u2019s legs. \u201cWhat are you going to\u2026?\u201d Loki whispered hoarse. \u201cDid you at least have fun? You seemed to understand yourself really well with Natascha,\u201d Thor asked.  </p><p>Loki needed a few moments. Tony grinned at him and pulled down his boxer shorts. The cool evening air caressed his body and he got goose bumps. \u201cBrother?\u201d, Thor sounded worried. But Loki couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off Tony. His brilliant eyes looked up at him. Then he opened his mouth and Loki could never have got ready for the next one. A shiver ran over his body and a soft whoop escaped. \u201cBrother? Is everything all right?\u201d Thor asked worriedly. \u201cYe-Yes! All\u2019s well! Thor\u2026 I beg you\u2026 leave me in\u2026 leave me in peace,\u201d Loki gasped as he felt Tony licking over his erection. \u201cIs Loki having sex?\u201d laughed Sif. \u201cStop it,\u201d Thor thundered. Finally Tony took Loki completely in his mouth. It was hard for the younger one to be quiet. But as long as Thor was out there, it wasn\u2019t safe. Loki bit his lip not to moan. Clung into his blanket and turned under Tony\u2019s touch. \u201cTony\u2026\u201d he gasped, as quietly as he could. A suppressed moaning could be heard and Tony\u2019s eyes sparkled with lust and desire. \u201cSleep well, brother. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow, at breakfast,\u201d said Thor, and then you could only hear shuffling footsteps. A stone fell from Loki\u2019s heart. Tony appeared in front of his face. His lips shone and a happy smile adorned his face. \u201cYou\u2026 are crazy,\u201d Loki cursed. \u201cWhat? Come on, you liked it. The thrill. I noticed you getting harder and harder,\u201d Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and closed her eyes. He tasted himself. Then he pushed Tony away and looked at him. \u201cI want to feel you\u2026 in me,\u201d Loki admitted.  </p><p>\u201cEverything you wish for, darling,\u201d Tony said and stroked his neck. The place where he had bitten was red and Loki would have to explain tomorrow where the hickey came from. This redness was so blatantly prominent on the white skin that Tony couldn\u2019t avert his gaze. \u201cYou belong to me,\u201d he whispered hoarse. \u201cAnd you to me,\u201d Loki gave back. Tony nodded. Then he bent down and bit Loki again. This time in the shoulder and a quiet howl could be heard. Music in Tony\u2019s ears. \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d Tony whispered and licked apologetically over the bite on the shoulder. \u201cTony\u2026\u201d Loki gasped. Tony looked at him. \u201cSay that again\u2026\u201d he said and looked at Loki. \u201cTony\u2026 please\u2026\u201d Loki begged. \u201cOf course. Where do you have lubricants and condoms,\u201d Tony asked. \u201cTop drawer,\u201d Loki gasped and watched him. Tony nodded and bent over him to get to the bedside table. \u201cYou seem to be well prepared,\u201d grinned Tony. Loki\u2019s cheeks turned red. \u201cI\u2026 had hopes,\u201d Loki returned. Tony looked at him. Was Loki an angel?  </p><p>\u201cTurn on your stomach,\u201d Tony whispered and Loki took a few seconds to follow the order. Embarrassed, he pressed his face into his pillow and presented Tony with his ass. \u201cI\u2019d love to eat you right now,\u201d Tony murmured and kissed Loki\u2019s ass. Hot shame rolled over him as Tony spoke these words. Loki knew exactly what he meant, but he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It had already cost him a lot of effort to present himself like that to Tony. Would Tony still kiss him then\u2026 Loki didn\u2019t want to think about it. It got hot and cold at the same time. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Tony asked worriedly. \u201cYes\u2026\u201d, Loki gave back and looked over his shoulder to him. \u201cIf I hurt you, let me know, okay?\u201d Tony smiled. Loki just nodded embarrassed. \u201cAnd please, let me hear you,\u201d whispered Tony, kissing Loki\u2019s back and circling Loki\u2019s most private spot with his middle finger.  </p><p>Loki whimpered in front of him and clawed himself into one of the many pillows while Tony pressed against the tight muscle ring. \u201cT-Tony\u2026\u201d Loki gasped. \u201cShh\u2026 it\u2019s all good,\u201d Tony whispered and finally felt the warmth around his finger.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, baby\u2026\u201d Tony assured and crawled over Loki\u2019s back. Carefully Tony pulled his finger back and watched Loki\u2019s reaction. The younger one trembled tense. Then Tony penetrated him again. \u201cYou are so tight\u2026\u201d he gasped and paused briefly. He wanted to enjoy it and prepare himself when he finally came to the main course. \u201cTony\u2026 please\u2026\u201d, Loki pleaded and pushed towards him. \u201cSlowly. I don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Tony whispered and moved his finger faster.  </p><p>Loki closed his eyes and enjoyed what Tony did to him. And then he felt a second finger and immediately his body tightened. \u201cBaby\u2026 all well\u2026\u201d Tony smiled confidently. Loki nodded and closed his eyes. But the feeling didn\u2019t get any better. The tension did not diminish. It felt wrong and yet so right at the same time. His body and mind worked against his emotions. \u201cLoki\u2026 Hey\u2026 Stop thinking,\u201d Tony said. \u201cT-That you say so easily\u2026\u201d Loki muttered. \u201cTurn on your back,\u201d Tony said.  </p><p>Carefully Loki looked up at Tony. Had he disappointed him? Would Tony go now and leave him alone? \u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking about with your little head, stop it. It won\u2019t do you any good if you go crazy now,\u201d Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and felt the familiar finger inside him. Loki lay there completely relaxed and watched Tony, who worked his neck with his tongue and bit him several times with his teeth. Loki had the feeling he was going crazy. His whole body was electrified and he couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything. \u201cWell you see\u2026\u201d Tony smiled and ripped Loki out of his mind. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Loki looked at him confused, then he felt it. Tony had pushed a second finger into it and Loki hadn\u2019t noticed. His body tightened briefly, but this time Loki didn\u2019t allow it. He breathed deeply and smiled at Tony.  </p><p>Tony began to move his fingers into Loki\u2019s narrow hole. Initially slow and cautious, not much later and he found a faster rhythm. He spread his fingers to get Loki used to something much bigger waiting for him. The black-haired man lay in front of him, whining quietly and pleasurably, his eyes closed and desperately clinging to his blanket. At that moment Tony realized that he could never let Loki go again. Loki belonged to him and no other person had the right to touch or even look at this man. \u201cTony\u2026?\u201d Loki whispered and reached out his hand to him. Tony was torn from his thoughts when Loki\u2019s cold fingers touched his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m there baby\u2026\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2026 want to feel you\u2026 please Tony\u2026 don\u2019t keep me waiting\u2026\u201d Loki pleaded and looked at him desperately. \u201cOf course not, baby,\u201d Tony said and pulled his fingers out of Loki.  </p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Tony asked and looked at him. Loki nodded. \u201cAll right,\u201d Tony smiled and penetrated him. Loki opened his eyes and opened his mouth, but before a scream could escape, Tony put his hand on his mouth. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any uninvited guests\u2026\u201d he smiled. Loki breathed deeply and closed his mouth again. Tony took his hand away and looked down at Loki. \u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d Tony whispered, briefly fearing that his voice would fail or he would come immediately. Loki was so tight and so perfect. Never before had he seen a more perfect being. \u201cTony\u2026 please,\u201d Loki pleaded desperately. Finally there was movement and Tony slowly withdrew from Loki. He whimpered quietly as he felt the loss. But not for long and Tony pushed into him again.  </p><p>Loki clung to Tony and closed his eyes. He felt his orgasm. He felt it although it seemed like it was still miles away. \u201cBaby\u2026 relax\u2026\u201d moaned Tony and sank on his arms. \u201cTony\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Loki\u2019s voice failed and he felt his orgasm. \u201cCome for me\u2026 baby. Come for me. Say my name,\u201d moaned Tony and moved his hip more and more erratic and without any real rhythm. But Tony hit that one spot in Loki that made him see stars, that made his orgasm so much more. \u201cTony\u2026 Tony\u2026\u201d Loki sobbed and clawed himself into Tony\u2019s naked torso. And that was the moment when Tony came. Together they fell over the cliff.  </p><p>Loki lay under him and flinched. Tony didn\u2019t want to free himself yet. Tony wanted to enjoy the narrowness and the warmth. \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d Tony whispered quietly. \u201cNot yet\u2026 I\u2019m not ready to wake up from this dream\u2026\u201d Loki whispered hoarse. Tony laughed quietly. \u201cAnything you want\u2026\u201d he murmured and kissed Loki\u2019s sweaty forehead.  </p><p>Loki opened his eyes and saw Tony above him. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a dream or\u2026?\u201d he murmured. \u201cNo,\u201d Tony smiled and straightened up. Loki already missed Tony\u2019s body and the man was not a meter away from him. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d Tony asked and grabbed the handkerchiefs. Loki nodded and stared at the ceiling. His cheeks turned red when he realized he had given his virginity to Tony Stark. \u201cWhat dirty thoughts do you have? Enlighten me,\u201d Tony said as he wiped the cold sperm from Loki\u2019s abdomen. Goose bumps spread over his body. \u201cAll\u2019s well\u2026\u201d Loki smiled and leaned on his forearms.  </p><p>The two fell asleep together. Tony Stark was the only source of heat he could ever really accept. And the heat his body radiated was pleasant.  </p><p>Thor awoke early at noon with a hangover. Groaning, he rolled to his side and hit his alarm clock. Why did he always make the same mistakes when the others were there? Couldn\u2019t he even hold himself back?  </p><p>\u201cGood morning, darling,\u201d his mother smiled at him. \u201cMother\u2026 good to see you. When did you come back?\u201d Thor asked surprised.  </p><p>\u201cThis morning. Your father had a heart attack when he saw the garden. You should have breakfast and help him clean up,\u201d Frigga smiled. \u201cOf course. Let me just find something for the headaches,\u201d Thor nodded carefully. Every movement hurt. \u201cMorning\u2026\u201d yawned Volstagg and sat down at the kitchen table. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Fandral greeted her. \u201cHm\u2026\u201d Sif sat down and dropped his head on her arms. \u201cGood morning, Miss Odinson,\u201d Hogun smiled. \u201cPlease be quieter\u2026\u201d moaned Fandral. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a hangover,\u201d Volstagg complained. \u201cGood morning to all of you,\u201d Frigga smiled and distributed the plates. \u201cWhere is your brother?\u201c \"He\u2019s probably still asleep. He was still awake at three when we went to bed,\u201d said Thor.  </p><p>Loki stood in the bathroom staring at himself in the mirror. He would never be able to dismiss the bite marks and hickeys as mosquito bites. \u201cCome back\u2026\u201d Tony groaned from his bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you\u2026\u201d Loki cursed and gave him an evil look. \u201cWhat? why?\u201d Tony asked and slowly got up. \u201cDid you look at me? I look like\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Loki hissed and pointed to his neck and shoulders. \u201cBaby. You look wonderful. At least give me a good morning kiss. Yes? Please\u201d, Tony smiled and pulled Loki by his hips, between his legs. Loki wrapped his arms around Tony\u2019s neck and looked down at him. \u201cYou explain this to my family,\u201d he murmured before Loki bent down and kissed him.  </p><p>Together they went down the stairs. \u201cMy parents are already there,\u201d Loki said. \u201cShould I rather disappear,\u201d Tony asked worriedly. \u201cNo. You just have to pass Thor,\u201d Loki smiled and pulled him into the kitchen. \u201cLoki, my darling. Good to see you. And Tony. Thor hadn\u2019t even mentioned that you would spend the night here,\u201d Frigga smiled. \u201cYes\u2026 Good morning first,\u201d Tony laughed nervously. Thor looked at them both and recognized the intertwined hands. \u201cBefore you kill us, brother. Leave it alone. There is nothing to discuss,\u201d Loki noted dryly and sat down on the chair. He briefly pulled his face, but it was only Tony who noticed it. He laughed quietly and sat down next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that my sons are finally all happy,\u201d Frigga smiled. \u201cNot for long. How did you manage to destroy the whole garden within one evening? Please, don\u2019t answer this question. I can answer it myself. Frigga, my heart. Can I have a coffee, please? I don\u2019t think my back can take it anymore,\u201d Odin said and sat at the head of the table. \u201cOf course, my dear,\u201d Frigga smiled and put the cup in front of Odin.  </p><p>While Odin and Frigga unpacked their clothes, Thor, his friends, Loki and Tony disappeared in the garden to eliminate the chaos.  </p><p>\u201cWhich of you idiots threw up in the pool, please?\u201d rumbled Thor. \u201cThat was you, my dear Thor. After Tasha had made you one of her well-known mixtures,\u201d Tony laughed and hit Thor on the shoulder. \u201cNever again,\u201d grumbled Thor. \u201cWhat? The party or Natasha\u2019s mix?\u201d Loki smiled and picked up a plastic cup. \u201cBoth. Brother, you are the sensible one of us. Please hold me off next time,\u201d said Thor, looking desperately at his younger brother. \u201cIf only you would listen to me,\u201d Loki said and continued stuffing cups into the garbage bag.  </p><p>Together they cleaned up the garden as quickly as possible. And when the lawn was free of garbage and the vomit had disappeared from the pool, they all sat down on the benches and loungers. \u201cSo you had sex yesterday,\u201d Sif grinned and looked at Tony, then at Loki. Loki twisted his eyes. \u201cSif. I beg you,\u201d Thor said. There would be a lot more discussions, Loki knew that. \u201cWhat? I want to know! The ice princess has finally melted. How many people tried it at home and all failed. Either on you or they froze to death in the vast ice desert in which Loki\u2019s heart lies,\u201d Fandral said. \u201cFandral, I beg you. Don\u2019t make these comparisons. I certainly wasn\u2019t an ice princess,\u201d Loki twisted his eyes. \u201cOh no? And how would you describe yourself?\u201d the blonde grinned. \u201cPlease no more Elsa jokes\u201d, laughed Tony. \u201cElsa?\u201d Loki looked at him confused. \u201cYou never saw Frozen? Oh baby, you really missed something,\u201d grinned Tony. \u201cI hate all of you,\u201d Loki twisted his eye.</p><p>The day ended as well as it had begun. Loki was happy. Thor hadn\u2019t killed anyone and Tony was the pure definition of love. So and no other way, the rest of his life would begin. Tony swore that to himself. </p><p><br></p><p>Be free to spell any grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes. Like you know, my native Language is German. </p></p>",

Grinning, he watched Loki turn red in his face and hid it behind his book. \u201cSeems to be a no. Do you want to give it a try?\u201d Tony asked, \u201cCertainly not.\u201c, Loki returned. \"What? How can you miss such a chance? That\u2019s the most exciting thing in the world. Imagine\u2026\u201d \u201cNo. I certainly don\u2019t imagine anything. Can\u2019t you keep your terrible thoughts for yourself even once?\u201d Loki asked and closed his book so loudly, that even Clint was startled at the next table.  </p><p>\u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d he asked in wonder and looked around. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d Tony laughed. \u201cSee you tonight for the barbecue.\u201d Loki said goodbye and left the library. \u201cYou did good, Stark.\u201d, said Natascha. \u201cWhat do I have to do with it, if the princess is so uptight?\u201d Tony asked and looked at the redhead. \u201cYou know how he is. In front of Steve you don\u2019t make jokes like that all the time,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cWhat is he not doing in front of me?\u201c Steve asked and sat next to Bruce. \"Hey Steve. Tony had to get on Loki\u2019s nerves again.\u201d Natascha said. \u201cWhere is my brother?\u201d Thor asked and looked around. \u201cProbably on his way home,\u201d Tony explained. \u201cThen I better catch up with him, otherwise he\u2019ll have to run. See you tonight, friends?\u201d asked the blonde with a smile. \u201cOf course, keep the beer cold.\u201d Tony grinned, Thor nodded and jogged out of the library. \u201cHow can these two be related?\u201d, Tony asked and drove through his hair.  </p><p>\u201cToday you\u2019re particularly tiring again, has anyone ever told you that?\u201d Clint asked and drove through his face. \u201cNot today yet. Would you like to do me a favor?\u201d Tony asked laughing. \u201cIs there finally quiet here? This is still a place of peace and quiet,\u201d hissed the librarian and looked at Tony angrily. \u201cExcuse me, Miss Bloom. He\u2019ll be as quiet as a mouse from now on. I promise.\u201d Steve smiled. \u201cGood. Otherwise, you\u2019re welcome to go.\u201d Nodded the old woman and left the table. </p><p>\u201cOld witch.\u201d Tony grumbled. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. I\u2019m leaving now, too. Clint, will you come with me?\u201d, Natascha asked and packed up her things. \u201cOf course,\u201d he nodded and also admitted everything. Together they disappeared from the library. \u201cShould I take you with me later?\u201d, Tony asked and looked at Steve and Bruce. \u201cBucky picks me up. He\u2019s probably waiting for me,\u201d Steve said. \u201cAll right. Should I take you with me, Bruce?\u201d Tony asked, \u201cIf that\u2019s not too much of a detour for you, I\u2019d love to,\u201d Bruce nodded. \u201cAll right,\u201d nodded Tony.  </p><p>At 19 o'clock the friends met in front of Thor\u2019s house. \u201cBut we\u2019re not the only ones now, are we?\u201d Natascha asked. \u201cI think Thor invited more people,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI hope so. I don\u2019t want to be in the same room with his parents. You know my allergy to parents,\u201d laughed Tony, \u201cAt some point, maybe not today or tomorrow, but at some point in our life, this man will grow up,\u201d said Natascha. \u201cYou have too much hope Tasha,\u201d Clint laughed. \u201cI know,\u201d grinned the redhead. \u201cIf you stand out there any longer, you\u2019ll grow roots,\u201d Loki\u2019s voice sounded from the front door. Tony looked at him and swallowed inconspicuously. Normally Loki looked really good. The black-haired guy was one of the few students who could wear the school uniform. But now? That was a walking sin. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d Natascha asked and pulled him out of his thoughts. \u201cHm? Yes, sure,\u201d Tony nodded and followed his friends. \u201cGood to see you,\u201d Natascha greeted the younger man. \u201cMe too. You look good,\u201d Loki smiled. \u201cI can only return the compliment. Is there any special occasion?\u201d she asked with a smile. \u201cNo. That\u2019s how I dress normally \u201d Loki smiled. \u201cWe should meet much more often,\u201d Natascha laughed and entered the house. \u201cStark.\u201d Loki nodded and looked at him with his poisonous green eyes. \u201cLoki,\u201d said Tony smiling. \u201cMy brother is waiting for you.\u201d Loki said and closed the door behind Tony. \u201cWhy?\u201d Tony asked\u2026 \u201cHis\u2026 friends don\u2019t believe him that there is another creature next to him on this planet that can empty several bottles in a row without getting alcohol poisoning directly,\u201d Loki said and rolled his eyes. \u201cAll right. Then I\u2019ll show these people how good I am,\u201d Tony laughed and disappeared into the garden.  </p><p>\u201cMy friends. May I introduce you. These are Fandral, Volstagg, Hogun and Sif. They came all the way from Norway to enjoy the holidays together with us,\u201d beamed Thor. \u201cCool,\u201d grinned Tony. Loki sighed quietly, then he sat on one of the couches. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Loki?\u201d, Bruce  asked and looked at Thor. \u201cMy brother still can\u2019t stand the hot summer.,\u201d Thor laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Loki could romp around in the snow for hours, but as soon as it got anywhere near warm, he hid in the basement.\u201d laughed Hogun. Tony turned away from the group and looked at Loki. The younger one sat on the couch and stared into the area. \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d Tony said and went to Loki.  </p><p>\u201cDo you want to annoy me, too, Stark?\u201d Loki asked and looked at him reproachfully. \u201cHey, I\u2019m just worried. If the heat doesn\u2019t get you, you shouldn\u2019t be sitting in the evening sun either. At least not directly.\u201c, said Tony. </p><p>\u201eThank you. But I know how long I can stay in the sun without anything happening to me,\u201d Loki said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help,\u201d Tony raised his hands defensively.  </p><p>And he knew that in a few hours Loki probably wouldn\u2019t be so fit. It had always been similar with his mother. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help. And now please return to the others. I don\u2019t want to have to endure Thor as well,\u201d Loki said and closed his eyes. \u201cAs you like. But I don\u2019t want to have to tell you later that I told you. Drink a lot\u2019, Tony said and got up from the second couch.  </p><p>During the evening Tony watched the black haired one. Not just out of worry, no. Loki had a more than pretty butt in his pants and Tony imagined what it would be like to peel the younger one out of it. \"Stop undressing him.\u201c, Natascha hissed and flicked in front of his face. \"Tasha, let a man have a little fun,\u201d moaned Tony annoyed. \u201cYou know what Thor is like when it comes to Loki. I don\u2019t fancy a fight because you adore his brother,\u201d Natascha said. Tony twisted his eyes and drove his way through his hair. Natascha was right. Thor would probably kill for Loki. Even if Loki didn\u2019t want to admit it, Thor loved his younger brother more than anything. \u201cDid we understand each other?\u201d Natascha asked again, with a little bit more pressure. \u201cHoly word of honor. If I break it, I\u2019ll give you my car.\u201d Promised Tony. \u201cGive me the key, if possible. You won\u2019t be able to keep this promise for long anyway,\u201d Natascha said. \u201cHave a little more trust in me,\u201d Tony laughed.  </p><p>The later it became, the more alcohol flowed. Thor, Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg only staggered around. Steve, Bucky and Bruce had already disappeared again. Clint and Natascha would also leave any moment. Only Tony and Loki remained. But he hadn\u2019t seen the black-haired guy for half an hour. \u201cTony, my friend,\u201d Thor slurred and slapped his hand on his shoulders. Silently howling, Tony flinched. \u201cWow, slow down, big boy,\u201d he said and looked at the blond giant. \u201cMy brother, do you know where he is?\u201d Thor asked and looked around. \u201cNo. Should I look for him? You probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to leave the property,\u201d Tony said and put the beer bottle on the table next to him. \u201cMy brother would be happy if it was you who found him,\u201d Thor laughed. \u201cHm! Loki likes you, Stark,\u201d Fandral slurred and stumbled over his own feet. \u201cFandral! That was a secret! Princess Loki will only hate us even more,\u201d laughed Sif and leaned on the table. She probably didn\u2019t care that she just outlined a beer bottle. Just like Tony. He didn\u2019t care.  </p><p>Were they serious? Should Loki really like someone like him? They had only made that up. As drunk as the two were. \u201cYou should go to bed. I\u2019m looking for Loki,\u201d said Tony and entered the house.  </p><p>\u201cLoki? Are you in there?\u201d Tony asked and knocked on Loki\u2019s room. When no answer came, he opened the door a bit, but found the room empty. That was the first time he was in Loki\u2019s room.  </p><p>In general, it was the first time he was in Loki\u2019s home. The last few years he had always been in Miami during the summer and had no time to attend Thor\u2019s parties. </p><p>Carefully he entered the dark room and looked around. He couldn\u2019t see much, so he turned on the little night lamp next to the bed. The room lit up and Tony was blinded for a moment. But his eyes quickly got used to the brightness.  </p><p>Tony knew that Loki was paying close attention to cleanliness and order. But this room seemed almost sterile. There was hardly anything personal. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s usual with you, but with us you ask permission before you enter someone else\u2019s room.\u201d Loki said behind him. Shocked, Tony turned around. \u201cI\u2026\u201d, Tony got the words stuck in his throat. Loki stood in front of him, only dressed in a boxer shorts and a towel around his neck. His hair was still wet and the water was dripping on his flawless upper body. \u201cDid I have something in my face or did you swallow your tongue, Stark?\u201d Loki ripped him from his thoughts. \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2026 excuse me. I was just worried. You were suddenly gone and\u2026\u201d, Tony started. \u201cSo you thought you could come into my bedroom and do what exactly?\u201c, Loki asked with his eyebrow raised. \"Nothing. Loki I swear to you, I didn\u2019t want to do anything. Just to see if everything was right. I promise,\u201d said Tony, \u201cGood. You have that now. As you can see, I am still alive. Would you please leave me alone now? I would like to sleep,\u201d Loki said and walked past him. He threw the towel on the chair and sat down on his bed.  </p><p>A few minutes passed until one of them stirred. \u201cLoki I\u2026 watch out, I\u2019m really bad at this. That\u2019s why I hope you can forgive me,\u201d Tony laughed nervously, \u201cIt seems liked you don\u2019t break into other people\u2019s bedrooms very often,\u201d Loki said amusedly. \u201cLoki\u2026 at least give me the chance to explain myself. And finally believe me, I didn\u2019t want to snoop around here,\u201d said Tony, desperate. Loki looked at him unimpressed. Then he leaned back on his hands and looked at Tony. \u201cThen let\u2019s get started,\u201d Loki said. But Tony\u2019s mouth resembled a desert at that moment. Loki was pure eroticism in his eyes. His long legs. His muscles on his arms and belly. The light skin. The long black hair. The green eyes. Loki was like a Greek god.  </p><p>\u201cStark? I\u2019ll give you two minutes before\u2026\u201d But Loki couldn\u2019t finish the sentence. Tony pushed him on his back and sat down on his lap. Confused Loki looked at him. \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d Tony asked and grabbed Loki\u2019s chin. \u201cNever,\u201d Loki smiled. Tony grinned. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t change that tonight.\u201d Tony said and bent down to kiss him. Panting Loki returned the kiss and clawed himself into Tony\u2019s shirt.  </p><p>The two men separated and stared at each other. \u201cI fell in love with you. And that\u2019s the problem. I love you and I know you don\u2019t. And when I wake up tomorrow morning, this will never happen again. Or I\u2019m dead because you\u2019re sicing your brother on me,\u201d Tony said and stroked a strand of Loki\u2019s reddened face. \u201cStark, if you think so, maybe you should leave my room right now.\u201d Loki said and looked at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d, Tony straightened up. \u201cDo you really think I would allow any guy who\u2019d run along to kiss me? Not to mention touching me,\u201d Loki asked. Tony\u2019s face lit up immediately. \u201cYou like me,\u201d he grinned. \u201cPlease don\u2019t exaggerate. I accept you,\u201d Loki twisted his eyes. Tony laughed quietly. \u201cJust admit it and say you like me. That\u2019s all I expect from you,\u201d laughed Tony, \u201cOh, that\u2019s why you\u2019re rubbing yourself against me all the time? Because you don\u2019t expect anything from me\u201d, Loki asked with a grin. \u201cA man just has needs. And let\u2019s be honest, you haven\u2019t shown me yet that it would bother you if I did,\u201d grinned Tony. Loki straightened up. \u201cWhat would you do if I showed you it bothers me,\u201d Loki asked and kissed Tony\u2019s jaw. \u201cThen I would get up now\u2026 ah\u2026 and go,\u201d Tony replied honestly. If Loki didn\u2019t want to, Tony wouldn\u2019t force him to do anything. \u201cWhat would you do if I wanted to,\u201d Loki asked and bit Tony gently in the throat. \u201cDon\u2019t just ask, find out,\u201d Tony smiled and pulled Loki\u2019s head by the hair to his neck. Grinning, Loki looked up at him. \u201cThen show me.\u201d  </p><p>Those were the words Tony needed. He pressed Loki into the mattress and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and started playing with the buttons of Tony\u2019s shirt. Carefully Tony licked Loki\u2019s lips, hoping he understood the hint and was glad the black haired man understood. Loki opened his lip and let Tony\u2019s tongue in. Then it seemed Loki had lost his patience and he tore the shirt open. The buttons landed on the floor, where they would remain until tomorrow morning. \u201cAre we impatient?\u201d Tony grinned and broke away from Loki. \u201cAs if you weren\u2019t,\u201d Loki said. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Tony gave back and drove Loki over his neck, down to his nipples. Frightened, the black-haired man gasped and Tony had to grin. </p><p>\u201eBrother? Are you alright?\u201c, Thor\u2019s voice sounded behind the door and Tony immediately froze. Panic spread into Loki\u2019s eyes. \"Answer him,\u201d whispered Tony. \u201cYes,\u201d called Loki. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay,\u201d Thor said. \u201cPrincess Loki, did your knight find you?\u201d Fandral laughed and Volstagg hit the wall. Loki twisted his eyes. \u201cYes, thank you very much for asking. I\u2019d like to sleep now if it\u2019s not too much to ask,\u201d Loki said. Tony grinned and slipped between Loki\u2019s legs. \u201cWhat are you going to\u2026?\u201d Loki whispered hoarse. \u201cDid you at least have fun? You seemed to understand yourself really well with Natascha,\u201d Thor asked.  </p><p>Loki needed a few moments. Tony grinned at him and pulled down his boxer shorts. The cool evening air caressed his body and he got goose bumps. \u201cBrother?\u201d, Thor sounded worried. But Loki couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off Tony. His brilliant eyes looked up at him. Then he opened his mouth and Loki could never have got ready for the next one. A shiver ran over his body and a soft whoop escaped. \u201cBrother? Is everything all right?\u201d Thor asked worriedly. \u201cYe-Yes! All\u2019s well! Thor\u2026 I beg you\u2026 leave me in\u2026 leave me in peace,\u201d Loki gasped as he felt Tony licking over his erection. \u201cIs Loki having sex?\u201d laughed Sif. \u201cStop it,\u201d Thor thundered. Finally Tony took Loki completely in his mouth. It was hard for the younger one to be quiet. But as long as Thor was out there, it wasn\u2019t safe. Loki bit his lip not to moan. Clung into his blanket and turned under Tony\u2019s touch. \u201cTony\u2026\u201d he gasped, as quietly as he could. A suppressed moaning could be heard and Tony\u2019s eyes sparkled with lust and desire. \u201cSleep well, brother. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow, at breakfast,\u201d said Thor, and then you could only hear shuffling footsteps. A stone fell from Loki\u2019s heart. Tony appeared in front of his face. His lips shone and a happy smile adorned his face. \u201cYou\u2026 are crazy,\u201d Loki cursed. \u201cWhat? Come on, you liked it. The thrill. I noticed you getting harder and harder,\u201d Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and closed her eyes. He tasted himself. Then he pushed Tony away and looked at him. \u201cI want to feel you\u2026 in me,\u201d Loki admitted.  </p><p>\u201cEverything you wish for, darling,\u201d Tony said and stroked his neck. The place where he had bitten was red and Loki would have to explain tomorrow where the hickey came from. This redness was so blatantly prominent on the white skin that Tony couldn\u2019t avert his gaze. \u201cYou belong to me,\u201d he whispered hoarse. \u201cAnd you to me,\u201d Loki gave back. Tony nodded. Then he bent down and bit Loki again. This time in the shoulder and a quiet howl could be heard. Music in Tony\u2019s ears. \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d Tony whispered and licked apologetically over the bite on the shoulder. \u201cTony\u2026\u201d Loki gasped. Tony looked at him. \u201cSay that again\u2026\u201d he said and looked at Loki. \u201cTony\u2026 please\u2026\u201d Loki begged. \u201cOf course. Where do you have lubricants and condoms,\u201d Tony asked. \u201cTop drawer,\u201d Loki gasped and watched him. Tony nodded and bent over him to get to the bedside table. \u201cYou seem to be well prepared,\u201d grinned Tony. Loki\u2019s cheeks turned red. \u201cI\u2026 had hopes,\u201d Loki returned. Tony looked at him. Was Loki an angel?  </p><p>\u201cTurn on your stomach,\u201d Tony whispered and Loki took a few seconds to follow the order. Embarrassed, he pressed his face into his pillow and presented Tony with his ass. \u201cI\u2019d love to eat you right now,\u201d Tony murmured and kissed Loki\u2019s ass. Hot shame rolled over him as Tony spoke these words. Loki knew exactly what he meant, but he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It had already cost him a lot of effort to present himself like that to Tony. Would Tony still kiss him then\u2026 Loki didn\u2019t want to think about it. It got hot and cold at the same time. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Tony asked worriedly. \u201cYes\u2026\u201d, Loki gave back and looked over his shoulder to him. \u201cIf I hurt you, let me know, okay?\u201d Tony smiled. Loki just nodded embarrassed. \u201cAnd please, let me hear you,\u201d whispered Tony, kissing Loki\u2019s back and circling Loki\u2019s most private spot with his middle finger.  </p><p>Loki whimpered in front of him and clawed himself into one of the many pillows while Tony pressed against the tight muscle ring. \u201cT-Tony\u2026\u201d Loki gasped. \u201cShh\u2026 it\u2019s all good,\u201d Tony whispered and finally felt the warmth around his finger.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, baby\u2026\u201d Tony assured and crawled over Loki\u2019s back. Carefully Tony pulled his finger back and watched Loki\u2019s reaction. The younger one trembled tense. Then Tony penetrated him again. \u201cYou are so tight\u2026\u201d he gasped and paused briefly. He wanted to enjoy it and prepare himself when he finally came to the main course. \u201cTony\u2026 please\u2026\u201d, Loki pleaded and pushed towards him. \u201cSlowly. I don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Tony whispered and moved his finger faster.  </p><p>Loki closed his eyes and enjoyed what Tony did to him. And then he felt a second finger and immediately his body tightened. \u201cBaby\u2026 all well\u2026\u201d Tony smiled confidently. Loki nodded and closed his eyes. But the feeling didn\u2019t get any better. The tension did not diminish. It felt wrong and yet so right at the same time. His body and mind worked against his emotions. \u201cLoki\u2026 Hey\u2026 Stop thinking,\u201d Tony said. \u201cT-That you say so easily\u2026\u201d Loki muttered. \u201cTurn on your back,\u201d Tony said.  </p><p>Carefully Loki looked up at Tony. Had he disappointed him? Would Tony go now and leave him alone? \u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking about with your little head, stop it. It won\u2019t do you any good if you go crazy now,\u201d Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and felt the familiar finger inside him. Loki lay there completely relaxed and watched Tony, who worked his neck with his tongue and bit him several times with his teeth. Loki had the feeling he was going crazy. His whole body was electrified and he couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything. \u201cWell you see\u2026\u201d Tony smiled and ripped Loki out of his mind. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Loki looked at him confused, then he felt it. Tony had pushed a second finger into it and Loki hadn\u2019t noticed. His body tightened briefly, but this time Loki didn\u2019t allow it. He breathed deeply and smiled at Tony.  </p><p>Tony began to move his fingers into Loki\u2019s narrow hole. Initially slow and cautious, not much later and he found a faster rhythm. He spread his fingers to get Loki used to something much bigger waiting for him. The black-haired man lay in front of him, whining quietly and pleasurably, his eyes closed and desperately clinging to his blanket. At that moment Tony realized that he could never let Loki go again. Loki belonged to him and no other person had the right to touch or even look at this man. \u201cTony\u2026?\u201d Loki whispered and reached out his hand to him. Tony was torn from his thoughts when Loki\u2019s cold fingers touched his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m there baby\u2026\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2026 want to feel you\u2026 please Tony\u2026 don\u2019t keep me waiting\u2026\u201d Loki pleaded and looked at him desperately. \u201cOf course not, baby,\u201d Tony said and pulled his fingers out of Loki.  </p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Tony asked and looked at him. Loki nodded. \u201cAll right,\u201d Tony smiled and penetrated him. Loki opened his eyes and opened his mouth, but before a scream could escape, Tony put his hand on his mouth. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any uninvited guests\u2026\u201d he smiled. Loki breathed deeply and closed his mouth again. Tony took his hand away and looked down at Loki. \u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d Tony whispered, briefly fearing that his voice would fail or he would come immediately. Loki was so tight and so perfect. Never before had he seen a more perfect being. \u201cTony\u2026 please,\u201d Loki pleaded desperately. Finally there was movement and Tony slowly withdrew from Loki. He whimpered quietly as he felt the loss. But not for long and Tony pushed into him again.  </p><p>Loki clung to Tony and closed his eyes. He felt his orgasm. He felt it although it seemed like it was still miles away. \u201cBaby\u2026 relax\u2026\u201d moaned Tony and sank on his arms. \u201cTony\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Loki\u2019s voice failed and he felt his orgasm. \u201cCome for me\u2026 baby. Come for me. Say my name,\u201d moaned Tony and moved his hip more and more erratic and without any real rhythm. But Tony hit that one spot in Loki that made him see stars, that made his orgasm so much more. \u201cTony\u2026 Tony\u2026\u201d Loki sobbed and clawed himself into Tony\u2019s naked torso. And that was the moment when Tony came. Together they fell over the cliff.  </p><p>Loki lay under him and flinched. Tony didn\u2019t want to free himself yet. Tony wanted to enjoy the narrowness and the warmth. \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d Tony whispered quietly. \u201cNot yet\u2026 I\u2019m not ready to wake up from this dream\u2026\u201d Loki whispered hoarse. Tony laughed quietly. \u201cAnything you want\u2026\u201d he murmured and kissed Loki\u2019s sweaty forehead.  </p><p>Loki opened his eyes and saw Tony above him. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a dream or\u2026?\u201d he murmured. \u201cNo,\u201d Tony smiled and straightened up. Loki already missed Tony\u2019s body and the man was not a meter away from him. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d Tony asked and grabbed the handkerchiefs. Loki nodded and stared at the ceiling. His cheeks turned red when he realized he had given his virginity to Tony Stark. \u201cWhat dirty thoughts do you have? Enlighten me,\u201d Tony said as he wiped the cold sperm from Loki\u2019s abdomen. Goose bumps spread over his body. \u201cAll\u2019s well\u2026\u201d Loki smiled and leaned on his forearms.  </p><p>The two fell asleep together. Tony Stark was the only source of heat he could ever really accept. And the heat his body radiated was pleasant.  </p><p>Thor awoke early at noon with a hangover. Groaning, he rolled to his side and hit his alarm clock. Why did he always make the same mistakes when the others were there? Couldn\u2019t he even hold himself back?  </p><p>\u201cGood morning, darling,\u201d his mother smiled at him. \u201cMother\u2026 good to see you. When did you come back?\u201d Thor asked surprised.  </p><p>\u201cThis morning. Your father had a heart attack when he saw the garden. You should have breakfast and help him clean up,\u201d Frigga smiled. \u201cOf course. Let me just find something for the headaches,\u201d Thor nodded carefully. Every movement hurt. \u201cMorning\u2026\u201d yawned Volstagg and sat down at the kitchen table. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Fandral greeted her. \u201cHm\u2026\u201d Sif sat down and dropped his head on her arms. \u201cGood morning, Miss Odinson,\u201d Hogun smiled. \u201cPlease be quieter\u2026\u201d moaned Fandral. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a hangover,\u201d Volstagg complained. \u201cGood morning to all of you,\u201d Frigga smiled and distributed the plates. \u201cWhere is your brother?\u201c \"He\u2019s probably still asleep. He was still awake at three when we went to bed,\u201d said Thor.  </p><p>Loki stood in the bathroom staring at himself in the mirror. He would never be able to dismiss the bite marks and hickeys as mosquito bites. \u201cCome back\u2026\u201d Tony groaned from his bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you\u2026\u201d Loki cursed and gave him an evil look. \u201cWhat? why?\u201d Tony asked and slowly got up. \u201cDid you look at me? I look like\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Loki hissed and pointed to his neck and shoulders. \u201cBaby. You look wonderful. At least give me a good morning kiss. Yes? Please\u201d, Tony smiled and pulled Loki by his hips, between his legs. Loki wrapped his arms around Tony\u2019s neck and looked down at him. \u201cYou explain this to my family,\u201d he murmured before Loki bent down and kissed him.  </p><p>Together they went down the stairs. \u201cMy parents are already there,\u201d Loki said. \u201cShould I rather disappear,\u201d Tony asked worriedly. \u201cNo. You just have to pass Thor,\u201d Loki smiled and pulled him into the kitchen. \u201cLoki, my darling. Good to see you. And Tony. Thor hadn\u2019t even mentioned that you would spend the night here,\u201d Frigga smiled. \u201cYes\u2026 Good morning first,\u201d Tony laughed nervously. Thor looked at them both and recognized the intertwined hands. \u201cBefore you kill us, brother. Leave it alone. There is nothing to discuss,\u201d Loki noted dryly and sat down on the chair. He briefly pulled his face, but it was only Tony who noticed it. He laughed quietly and sat down next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that my sons are finally all happy,\u201d Frigga smiled. \u201cNot for long. How did you manage to destroy the whole garden within one evening? Please, don\u2019t answer this question. I can answer it myself. Frigga, my heart. Can I have a coffee, please? I don\u2019t think my back can take it anymore,\u201d Odin said and sat at the head of the table. \u201cOf course, my dear,\u201d Frigga smiled and put the cup in front of Odin.  </p><p>While Odin and Frigga unpacked their clothes, Thor, his friends, Loki and Tony disappeared in the garden to eliminate the chaos.  </p><p>\u201cWhich of you idiots threw up in the pool, please?\u201d rumbled Thor. \u201cThat was you, my dear Thor. After Tasha had made you one of her well-known mixtures,\u201d Tony laughed and hit Thor on the shoulder. \u201cNever again,\u201d grumbled Thor. \u201cWhat? The party or Natasha\u2019s mix?\u201d Loki smiled and picked up a plastic cup. \u201cBoth. Brother, you are the sensible one of us. Please hold me off next time,\u201d said Thor, looking desperately at his younger brother. \u201cIf only you would listen to me,\u201d Loki said and continued stuffing cups into the garbage bag.  </p><p>Together they cleaned up the garden as quickly as possible. And when the lawn was free of garbage and the vomit had disappeared from the pool, they all sat down on the benches and loungers. \u201cSo you had sex yesterday,\u201d Sif grinned and looked at Tony, then at Loki. Loki twisted his eyes. \u201cSif. I beg you,\u201d Thor said. There would be a lot more discussions, Loki knew that. \u201cWhat? I want to know! The ice princess has finally melted. How many people tried it at home and all failed. Either on you or they froze to death in the vast ice desert in which Loki\u2019s heart lies,\u201d Fandral said. \u201cFandral, I beg you. Don\u2019t make these comparisons. I certainly wasn\u2019t an ice princess,\u201d Loki twisted his eyes. \u201cOh no? And how would you describe yourself?\u201d the blonde grinned. \u201cPlease no more Elsa jokes\u201d, laughed Tony. \u201cElsa?\u201d Loki looked at him confused. \u201cYou never saw Frozen? Oh baby, you really missed something,\u201d grinned Tony. \u201cI hate all of you,\u201d Loki twisted his eye.</p><p>The day ended as well as it had begun. Loki was happy. Thor hadn\u2019t killed anyone and Tony was the pure definition of love. So and no other way, the rest of his life would begin. Tony swore that to himself. </p><p><br></p><p>Be free to spell any grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes. Like you know, my native Language is German. </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>&lsquo;Sup Loosers. Jump in. Summer&lsquo;s here</h1><p>&ldquo;Have you ever had sex?&rdquo; Tony asked and looked at Loki. Grinning, he watched Loki turn red in his face and hid it behind his book. &ldquo;Seems to be a no. Do you want to give it a try?&rdquo; Tony asked, &ldquo;Certainly not.&ldquo;, Loki returned. \"What? How can you miss such a chance? That&rsquo;s the most exciting thing in the world. Imagine&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;No. I certainly don&rsquo;t imagine anything. Can&rsquo;t you keep your terrible thoughts for yourself even once?&rdquo; Loki asked and closed his book so loudly, that even Clint was startled at the next table.  </p><p>&ldquo;What did I miss?&rdquo; he asked in wonder and looked around. &ldquo;Go back to sleep.&rdquo; Tony laughed. &ldquo;See you tonight for the barbecue.&rdquo; Loki said goodbye and left the library. &ldquo;You did good, Stark.&rdquo;, said Natascha. &ldquo;What do I have to do with it, if the princess is so uptight?&rdquo; Tony asked and looked at the redhead. &ldquo;You know how he is. In front of Steve you don&rsquo;t make jokes like that all the time,&rdquo; Bruce said. &ldquo;What is he not doing in front of me?&ldquo; Steve asked and sat next to Bruce. \"Hey Steve. Tony had to get on Loki&rsquo;s nerves again.&rdquo; Natascha said. &ldquo;Where is my brother?&rdquo; Thor asked and looked around. &ldquo;Probably on his way home,&rdquo; Tony explained. &ldquo;Then I better catch up with him, otherwise he&rsquo;ll have to run. See you tonight, friends?&rdquo; asked the blonde with a smile. &ldquo;Of course, keep the beer cold.&rdquo; Tony grinned, Thor nodded and jogged out of the library. &ldquo;How can these two be related?&rdquo;, Tony asked and drove through his hair.  </p><p>&ldquo;Today you&rsquo;re particularly tiring again, has anyone ever told you that?&rdquo; Clint asked and drove through his face. &ldquo;Not today yet. Would you like to do me a favor?&rdquo; Tony asked laughing. &ldquo;Is there finally quiet here? This is still a place of peace and quiet,&rdquo; hissed the librarian and looked at Tony angrily. &ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Bloom. He&rsquo;ll be as quiet as a mouse from now on. I promise.&rdquo; Steve smiled. &ldquo;Good. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re welcome to go.&rdquo; Nodded the old woman and left the table. </p><p>&ldquo;Old witch.&rdquo; Tony grumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m leaving now, too. Clint, will you come with me?&rdquo;, Natascha asked and packed up her things. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he nodded and also admitted everything. Together they disappeared from the library. &ldquo;Should I take you with me later?&rdquo;, Tony asked and looked at Steve and Bruce. &ldquo;Bucky picks me up. He&rsquo;s probably waiting for me,&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;All right. Should I take you with me, Bruce?&rdquo; Tony asked, &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s not too much of a detour for you, I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; Bruce nodded. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; nodded Tony.  </p><p>At 19 o'clock the friends met in front of Thor&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not the only ones now, are we?&rdquo; Natascha asked. &ldquo;I think Thor invited more people,&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;I hope so. I don&rsquo;t want to be in the same room with his parents. You know my allergy to parents,&rdquo; laughed Tony, &ldquo;At some point, maybe not today or tomorrow, but at some point in our life, this man will grow up,&rdquo; said Natascha. &ldquo;You have too much hope Tasha,&rdquo; Clint laughed. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; grinned the redhead. &ldquo;If you stand out there any longer, you&rsquo;ll grow roots,&rdquo; Loki&rsquo;s voice sounded from the front door. Tony looked at him and swallowed inconspicuously. Normally Loki looked really good. The black-haired guy was one of the few students who could wear the school uniform. But now? That was a walking sin. &ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo; Natascha asked and pulled him out of his thoughts. &ldquo;Hm? Yes, sure,&rdquo; Tony nodded and followed his friends. &ldquo;Good to see you,&rdquo; Natascha greeted the younger man. &ldquo;Me too. You look good,&rdquo; Loki smiled. &ldquo;I can only return the compliment. Is there any special occasion?&rdquo; she asked with a smile. &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s how I dress normally &rdquo; Loki smiled. &ldquo;We should meet much more often,&rdquo; Natascha laughed and entered the house. &ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Loki nodded and looked at him with his poisonous green eyes. &ldquo;Loki,&rdquo; said Tony smiling. &ldquo;My brother is waiting for you.&rdquo; Loki said and closed the door behind Tony. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Tony asked&hellip; &ldquo;His&hellip; friends don&rsquo;t believe him that there is another creature next to him on this planet that can empty several bottles in a row without getting alcohol poisoning directly,&rdquo; Loki said and rolled his eyes. &ldquo;All right. Then I&rsquo;ll show these people how good I am,&rdquo; Tony laughed and disappeared into the garden.  </p><p>&ldquo;My friends. May I introduce you. These are Fandral, Volstagg, Hogun and Sif. They came all the way from Norway to enjoy the holidays together with us,&rdquo; beamed Thor. &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; grinned Tony. Loki sighed quietly, then he sat on one of the couches. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Loki?&rdquo;, Bruce  asked and looked at Thor. &ldquo;My brother still can&rsquo;t stand the hot summer.,&rdquo; Thor laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Loki could romp around in the snow for hours, but as soon as it got anywhere near warm, he hid in the basement.&rdquo; laughed Hogun. Tony turned away from the group and looked at Loki. The younger one sat on the couch and stared into the area. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me.&rdquo; Tony said and went to Loki.  </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to annoy me, too, Stark?&rdquo; Loki asked and looked at him reproachfully. &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m just worried. If the heat doesn&rsquo;t get you, you shouldn&rsquo;t be sitting in the evening sun either. At least not directly.&ldquo;, said Tony. </p><p>&bdquo;Thank you. But I know how long I can stay in the sun without anything happening to me,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to help,&rdquo; Tony raised his hands defensively.  </p><p>And he knew that in a few hours Loki probably wouldn&rsquo;t be so fit. It had always been similar with his mother. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your help. And now please return to the others. I don&rsquo;t want to have to endure Thor as well,&rdquo; Loki said and closed his eyes. &ldquo;As you like. But I don&rsquo;t want to have to tell you later that I told you. Drink a lot&rsquo;, Tony said and got up from the second couch.  </p><p>During the evening Tony watched the black haired one. Not just out of worry, no. Loki had a more than pretty butt in his pants and Tony imagined what it would be like to peel the younger one out of it. \"Stop undressing him.&ldquo;, Natascha hissed and flicked in front of his face. \"Tasha, let a man have a little fun,&rdquo; moaned Tony annoyed. &ldquo;You know what Thor is like when it comes to Loki. I don&rsquo;t fancy a fight because you adore his brother,&rdquo; Natascha said. Tony twisted his eyes and drove his way through his hair. Natascha was right. Thor would probably kill for Loki. Even if Loki didn&rsquo;t want to admit it, Thor loved his younger brother more than anything. &ldquo;Did we understand each other?&rdquo; Natascha asked again, with a little bit more pressure. &ldquo;Holy word of honor. If I break it, I&rsquo;ll give you my car.&rdquo; Promised Tony. &ldquo;Give me the key, if possible. You won&rsquo;t be able to keep this promise for long anyway,&rdquo; Natascha said. &ldquo;Have a little more trust in me,&rdquo; Tony laughed.  </p><p>The later it became, the more alcohol flowed. Thor, Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg only staggered around. Steve, Bucky and Bruce had already disappeared again. Clint and Natascha would also leave any moment. Only Tony and Loki remained. But he hadn&rsquo;t seen the black-haired guy for half an hour. &ldquo;Tony, my friend,&rdquo; Thor slurred and slapped his hand on his shoulders. Silently howling, Tony flinched. &ldquo;Wow, slow down, big boy,&rdquo; he said and looked at the blond giant. &ldquo;My brother, do you know where he is?&rdquo; Thor asked and looked around. &ldquo;No. Should I look for him? You probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to leave the property,&rdquo; Tony said and put the beer bottle on the table next to him. &ldquo;My brother would be happy if it was you who found him,&rdquo; Thor laughed. &ldquo;Hm! Loki likes you, Stark,&rdquo; Fandral slurred and stumbled over his own feet. &ldquo;Fandral! That was a secret! Princess Loki will only hate us even more,&rdquo; laughed Sif and leaned on the table. She probably didn&rsquo;t care that she just outlined a beer bottle. Just like Tony. He didn&rsquo;t care.  </p><p>Were they serious? Should Loki really like someone like him? They had only made that up. As drunk as the two were. &ldquo;You should go to bed. I&rsquo;m looking for Loki,&rdquo; said Tony and entered the house.  </p><p>&ldquo;Loki? Are you in there?&rdquo; Tony asked and knocked on Loki&rsquo;s room. When no answer came, he opened the door a bit, but found the room empty. That was the first time he was in Loki&rsquo;s room.  </p><p>In general, it was the first time he was in Loki&rsquo;s home. The last few years he had always been in Miami during the summer and had no time to attend Thor&rsquo;s parties. </p><p>Carefully he entered the dark room and looked around. He couldn&rsquo;t see much, so he turned on the little night lamp next to the bed. The room lit up and Tony was blinded for a moment. But his eyes quickly got used to the brightness.  </p><p>Tony knew that Loki was paying close attention to cleanliness and order. But this room seemed almost sterile. There was hardly anything personal. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s usual with you, but with us you ask permission before you enter someone else&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; Loki said behind him. Shocked, Tony turned around. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;, Tony got the words stuck in his throat. Loki stood in front of him, only dressed in a boxer shorts and a towel around his neck. His hair was still wet and the water was dripping on his flawless upper body. &ldquo;Did I have something in my face or did you swallow your tongue, Stark?&rdquo; Loki ripped him from his thoughts. &ldquo;No&hellip; I&hellip; excuse me. I was just worried. You were suddenly gone and&hellip;&rdquo;, Tony started. &ldquo;So you thought you could come into my bedroom and do what exactly?&ldquo;, Loki asked with his eyebrow raised. \"Nothing. Loki I swear to you, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything. Just to see if everything was right. I promise,&rdquo; said Tony, &ldquo;Good. You have that now. As you can see, I am still alive. Would you please leave me alone now? I would like to sleep,&rdquo; Loki said and walked past him. He threw the towel on the chair and sat down on his bed.  </p><p>A few minutes passed until one of them stirred. &ldquo;Loki I&hellip; watch out, I&rsquo;m really bad at this. That&rsquo;s why I hope you can forgive me,&rdquo; Tony laughed nervously, &ldquo;It seems liked you don&rsquo;t break into other people&rsquo;s bedrooms very often,&rdquo; Loki said amusedly. &ldquo;Loki&hellip; at least give me the chance to explain myself. And finally believe me, I didn&rsquo;t want to snoop around here,&rdquo; said Tony, desperate. Loki looked at him unimpressed. Then he leaned back on his hands and looked at Tony. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; Loki said. But Tony&rsquo;s mouth resembled a desert at that moment. Loki was pure eroticism in his eyes. His long legs. His muscles on his arms and belly. The light skin. The long black hair. The green eyes. Loki was like a Greek god.  </p><p>&ldquo;Stark? I&rsquo;ll give you two minutes before&hellip;&rdquo; But Loki couldn&rsquo;t finish the sentence. Tony pushed him on his back and sat down on his lap. Confused Loki looked at him. &ldquo;Cat got your tongue?&rdquo; Tony asked and grabbed Loki&rsquo;s chin. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Loki smiled. Tony grinned. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t change that tonight.&rdquo; Tony said and bent down to kiss him. Panting Loki returned the kiss and clawed himself into Tony&rsquo;s shirt.  </p><p>The two men separated and stared at each other. &ldquo;I fell in love with you. And that&rsquo;s the problem. I love you and I know you don&rsquo;t. And when I wake up tomorrow morning, this will never happen again. Or I&rsquo;m dead because you&rsquo;re sicing your brother on me,&rdquo; Tony said and stroked a strand of Loki&rsquo;s reddened face. &ldquo;Stark, if you think so, maybe you should leave my room right now.&rdquo; Loki said and looked at him. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;, Tony straightened up. &ldquo;Do you really think I would allow any guy who&rsquo;d run along to kiss me? Not to mention touching me,&rdquo; Loki asked. Tony&rsquo;s face lit up immediately. &ldquo;You like me,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t exaggerate. I accept you,&rdquo; Loki twisted his eyes. Tony laughed quietly. &ldquo;Just admit it and say you like me. That&rsquo;s all I expect from you,&rdquo; laughed Tony, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re rubbing yourself against me all the time? Because you don&rsquo;t expect anything from me&rdquo;, Loki asked with a grin. &ldquo;A man just has needs. And let&rsquo;s be honest, you haven&rsquo;t shown me yet that it would bother you if I did,&rdquo; grinned Tony. Loki straightened up. &ldquo;What would you do if I showed you it bothers me,&rdquo; Loki asked and kissed Tony&rsquo;s jaw. &ldquo;Then I would get up now&hellip; ah&hellip; and go,&rdquo; Tony replied honestly. If Loki didn&rsquo;t want to, Tony wouldn&rsquo;t force him to do anything. &ldquo;What would you do if I wanted to,&rdquo; Loki asked and bit Tony gently in the throat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just ask, find out,&rdquo; Tony smiled and pulled Loki&rsquo;s head by the hair to his neck. Grinning, Loki looked up at him. &ldquo;Then show me.&rdquo;  </p><p>Those were the words Tony needed. He pressed Loki into the mattress and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and started playing with the buttons of Tony&rsquo;s shirt. Carefully Tony licked Loki&rsquo;s lips, hoping he understood the hint and was glad the black haired man understood. Loki opened his lip and let Tony&rsquo;s tongue in. Then it seemed Loki had lost his patience and he tore the shirt open. The buttons landed on the floor, where they would remain until tomorrow morning. &ldquo;Are we impatient?&rdquo; Tony grinned and broke away from Loki. &ldquo;As if you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Tony gave back and drove Loki over his neck, down to his nipples. Frightened, the black-haired man gasped and Tony had to grin. </p><p>&bdquo;Brother? Are you alright?&ldquo;, Thor&rsquo;s voice sounded behind the door and Tony immediately froze. Panic spread into Loki&rsquo;s eyes. \"Answer him,&rdquo; whispered Tony. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; called Loki. &ldquo;I just wanted to make sure you were okay,&rdquo; Thor said. &ldquo;Princess Loki, did your knight find you?&rdquo; Fandral laughed and Volstagg hit the wall. Loki twisted his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, thank you very much for asking. I&rsquo;d like to sleep now if it&rsquo;s not too much to ask,&rdquo; Loki said. Tony grinned and slipped between Loki&rsquo;s legs. &ldquo;What are you going to&hellip;?&rdquo; Loki whispered hoarse. &ldquo;Did you at least have fun? You seemed to understand yourself really well with Natascha,&rdquo; Thor asked.  </p><p>Loki needed a few moments. Tony grinned at him and pulled down his boxer shorts. The cool evening air caressed his body and he got goose bumps. &ldquo;Brother?&rdquo;, Thor sounded worried. But Loki couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off Tony. His brilliant eyes looked up at him. Then he opened his mouth and Loki could never have got ready for the next one. A shiver ran over his body and a soft whoop escaped. &ldquo;Brother? Is everything all right?&rdquo; Thor asked worriedly. &ldquo;Ye-Yes! All&rsquo;s well! Thor&hellip; I beg you&hellip; leave me in&hellip; leave me in peace,&rdquo; Loki gasped as he felt Tony licking over his erection. &ldquo;Is Loki having sex?&rdquo; laughed Sif. &ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; Thor thundered. Finally Tony took Loki completely in his mouth. It was hard for the younger one to be quiet. But as long as Thor was out there, it wasn&rsquo;t safe. Loki bit his lip not to moan. Clung into his blanket and turned under Tony&rsquo;s touch. &ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; he gasped, as quietly as he could. A suppressed moaning could be heard and Tony&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with lust and desire. &ldquo;Sleep well, brother. We&rsquo;ll talk tomorrow, at breakfast,&rdquo; said Thor, and then you could only hear shuffling footsteps. A stone fell from Loki&rsquo;s heart. Tony appeared in front of his face. His lips shone and a happy smile adorned his face. &ldquo;You&hellip; are crazy,&rdquo; Loki cursed. &ldquo;What? Come on, you liked it. The thrill. I noticed you getting harder and harder,&rdquo; Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and closed her eyes. He tasted himself. Then he pushed Tony away and looked at him. &ldquo;I want to feel you&hellip; in me,&rdquo; Loki admitted.  </p><p>&ldquo;Everything you wish for, darling,&rdquo; Tony said and stroked his neck. The place where he had bitten was red and Loki would have to explain tomorrow where the hickey came from. This redness was so blatantly prominent on the white skin that Tony couldn&rsquo;t avert his gaze. &ldquo;You belong to me,&rdquo; he whispered hoarse. &ldquo;And you to me,&rdquo; Loki gave back. Tony nodded. Then he bent down and bit Loki again. This time in the shoulder and a quiet howl could be heard. Music in Tony&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered and licked apologetically over the bite on the shoulder. &ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Loki gasped. Tony looked at him. &ldquo;Say that again&hellip;&rdquo; he said and looked at Loki. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; please&hellip;&rdquo; Loki begged. &ldquo;Of course. Where do you have lubricants and condoms,&rdquo; Tony asked. &ldquo;Top drawer,&rdquo; Loki gasped and watched him. Tony nodded and bent over him to get to the bedside table. &ldquo;You seem to be well prepared,&rdquo; grinned Tony. Loki&rsquo;s cheeks turned red. &ldquo;I&hellip; had hopes,&rdquo; Loki returned. Tony looked at him. Was Loki an angel?  </p><p>&ldquo;Turn on your stomach,&rdquo; Tony whispered and Loki took a few seconds to follow the order. Embarrassed, he pressed his face into his pillow and presented Tony with his ass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to eat you right now,&rdquo; Tony murmured and kissed Loki&rsquo;s ass. Hot shame rolled over him as Tony spoke these words. Loki knew exactly what he meant, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready for that yet. It had already cost him a lot of effort to present himself like that to Tony. Would Tony still kiss him then&hellip; Loki didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. It got hot and cold at the same time. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; Tony asked worriedly. &ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo;, Loki gave back and looked over his shoulder to him. &ldquo;If I hurt you, let me know, okay?&rdquo; Tony smiled. Loki just nodded embarrassed. &ldquo;And please, let me hear you,&rdquo; whispered Tony, kissing Loki&rsquo;s back and circling Loki&rsquo;s most private spot with his middle finger.  </p><p>Loki whimpered in front of him and clawed himself into one of the many pillows while Tony pressed against the tight muscle ring. &ldquo;T-Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Loki gasped. &ldquo;Shh&hellip; it&rsquo;s all good,&rdquo; Tony whispered and finally felt the warmth around his finger.  </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing fine, baby&hellip;&rdquo; Tony assured and crawled over Loki&rsquo;s back. Carefully Tony pulled his finger back and watched Loki&rsquo;s reaction. The younger one trembled tense. Then Tony penetrated him again. &ldquo;You are so tight&hellip;&rdquo; he gasped and paused briefly. He wanted to enjoy it and prepare himself when he finally came to the main course. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; please&hellip;&rdquo;, Loki pleaded and pushed towards him. &ldquo;Slowly. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you,&rdquo; Tony whispered and moved his finger faster.  </p><p>Loki closed his eyes and enjoyed what Tony did to him. And then he felt a second finger and immediately his body tightened. &ldquo;Baby&hellip; all well&hellip;&rdquo; Tony smiled confidently. Loki nodded and closed his eyes. But the feeling didn&rsquo;t get any better. The tension did not diminish. It felt wrong and yet so right at the same time. His body and mind worked against his emotions. &ldquo;Loki&hellip; Hey&hellip; Stop thinking,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;T-That you say so easily&hellip;&rdquo; Loki muttered. &ldquo;Turn on your back,&rdquo; Tony said.  </p><p>Carefully Loki looked up at Tony. Had he disappointed him? Would Tony go now and leave him alone? &ldquo;Whatever you&rsquo;re thinking about with your little head, stop it. It won&rsquo;t do you any good if you go crazy now,&rdquo; Tony said and kissed him. Loki returned the kiss and felt the familiar finger inside him. Loki lay there completely relaxed and watched Tony, who worked his neck with his tongue and bit him several times with his teeth. Loki had the feeling he was going crazy. His whole body was electrified and he couldn&rsquo;t concentrate on anything. &ldquo;Well you see&hellip;&rdquo; Tony smiled and ripped Loki out of his mind. &ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo; Loki looked at him confused, then he felt it. Tony had pushed a second finger into it and Loki hadn&rsquo;t noticed. His body tightened briefly, but this time Loki didn&rsquo;t allow it. He breathed deeply and smiled at Tony.  </p><p>Tony began to move his fingers into Loki&rsquo;s narrow hole. Initially slow and cautious, not much later and he found a faster rhythm. He spread his fingers to get Loki used to something much bigger waiting for him. The black-haired man lay in front of him, whining quietly and pleasurably, his eyes closed and desperately clinging to his blanket. At that moment Tony realized that he could never let Loki go again. Loki belonged to him and no other person had the right to touch or even look at this man. &ldquo;Tony&hellip;?&rdquo; Loki whispered and reached out his hand to him. Tony was torn from his thoughts when Loki&rsquo;s cold fingers touched his cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m there baby&hellip;&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I&hellip; want to feel you&hellip; please Tony&hellip; don&rsquo;t keep me waiting&hellip;&rdquo; Loki pleaded and looked at him desperately. &ldquo;Of course not, baby,&rdquo; Tony said and pulled his fingers out of Loki.  </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; Tony asked and looked at him. Loki nodded. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Tony smiled and penetrated him. Loki opened his eyes and opened his mouth, but before a scream could escape, Tony put his hand on his mouth. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any uninvited guests&hellip;&rdquo; he smiled. Loki breathed deeply and closed his mouth again. Tony took his hand away and looked down at Loki. &ldquo;You are so beautiful,&rdquo; Tony whispered, briefly fearing that his voice would fail or he would come immediately. Loki was so tight and so perfect. Never before had he seen a more perfect being. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; please,&rdquo; Loki pleaded desperately. Finally there was movement and Tony slowly withdrew from Loki. He whimpered quietly as he felt the loss. But not for long and Tony pushed into him again.  </p><p>Loki clung to Tony and closed his eyes. He felt his orgasm. He felt it although it seemed like it was still miles away. &ldquo;Baby&hellip; relax&hellip;&rdquo; moaned Tony and sank on his arms. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; Loki&rsquo;s voice failed and he felt his orgasm. &ldquo;Come for me&hellip; baby. Come for me. Say my name,&rdquo; moaned Tony and moved his hip more and more erratic and without any real rhythm. But Tony hit that one spot in Loki that made him see stars, that made his orgasm so much more. &ldquo;Tony&hellip; Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Loki sobbed and clawed himself into Tony&rsquo;s naked torso. And that was the moment when Tony came. Together they fell over the cliff.  </p><p>Loki lay under him and flinched. Tony didn&rsquo;t want to free himself yet. Tony wanted to enjoy the narrowness and the warmth. &ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo; Tony whispered quietly. &ldquo;Not yet&hellip; I&rsquo;m not ready to wake up from this dream&hellip;&rdquo; Loki whispered hoarse. Tony laughed quietly. &ldquo;Anything you want&hellip;&rdquo; he murmured and kissed Loki&rsquo;s sweaty forehead.  </p><p>Loki opened his eyes and saw Tony above him. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a dream or&hellip;?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony smiled and straightened up. Loki already missed Tony&rsquo;s body and the man was not a meter away from him. &ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo; Tony asked and grabbed the handkerchiefs. Loki nodded and stared at the ceiling. His cheeks turned red when he realized he had given his virginity to Tony Stark. &ldquo;What dirty thoughts do you have? Enlighten me,&rdquo; Tony said as he wiped the cold sperm from Loki&rsquo;s abdomen. Goose bumps spread over his body. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well&hellip;&rdquo; Loki smiled and leaned on his forearms.  </p><p>The two fell asleep together. Tony Stark was the only source of heat he could ever really accept. And the heat his body radiated was pleasant.  </p><p>Thor awoke early at noon with a hangover. Groaning, he rolled to his side and hit his alarm clock. Why did he always make the same mistakes when the others were there? Couldn&rsquo;t he even hold himself back?  </p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, darling,&rdquo; his mother smiled at him. &ldquo;Mother&hellip; good to see you. When did you come back?&rdquo; Thor asked surprised.  </p><p>&ldquo;This morning. Your father had a heart attack when he saw the garden. You should have breakfast and help him clean up,&rdquo; Frigga smiled. &ldquo;Of course. Let me just find something for the headaches,&rdquo; Thor nodded carefully. Every movement hurt. &ldquo;Morning&hellip;&rdquo; yawned Volstagg and sat down at the kitchen table. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Fandral greeted her. &ldquo;Hm&hellip;&rdquo; Sif sat down and dropped his head on her arms. &ldquo;Good morning, Miss Odinson,&rdquo; Hogun smiled. &ldquo;Please be quieter&hellip;&rdquo; moaned Fandral. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a hangover,&rdquo; Volstagg complained. &ldquo;Good morning to all of you,&rdquo; Frigga smiled and distributed the plates. &ldquo;Where is your brother?&ldquo; \"He&rsquo;s probably still asleep. He was still awake at three when we went to bed,&rdquo; said Thor.  </p><p>Loki stood in the bathroom staring at himself in the mirror. He would never be able to dismiss the bite marks and hickeys as mosquito bites. &ldquo;Come back&hellip;&rdquo; Tony groaned from his bedroom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you&hellip;&rdquo; Loki cursed and gave him an evil look. &ldquo;What? why?&rdquo; Tony asked and slowly got up. &ldquo;Did you look at me? I look like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Loki hissed and pointed to his neck and shoulders. &ldquo;Baby. You look wonderful. At least give me a good morning kiss. Yes? Please&rdquo;, Tony smiled and pulled Loki by his hips, between his legs. Loki wrapped his arms around Tony&rsquo;s neck and looked down at him. &ldquo;You explain this to my family,&rdquo; he murmured before Loki bent down and kissed him.  </p><p>Together they went down the stairs. &ldquo;My parents are already there,&rdquo; Loki said. &ldquo;Should I rather disappear,&rdquo; Tony asked worriedly. &ldquo;No. You just have to pass Thor,&rdquo; Loki smiled and pulled him into the kitchen. &ldquo;Loki, my darling. Good to see you. And Tony. Thor hadn&rsquo;t even mentioned that you would spend the night here,&rdquo; Frigga smiled. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; Good morning first,&rdquo; Tony laughed nervously. Thor looked at them both and recognized the intertwined hands. &ldquo;Before you kill us, brother. Leave it alone. There is nothing to discuss,&rdquo; Loki noted dryly and sat down on the chair. He briefly pulled his face, but it was only Tony who noticed it. He laughed quietly and sat down next to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice that my sons are finally all happy,&rdquo; Frigga smiled. &ldquo;Not for long. How did you manage to destroy the whole garden within one evening? Please, don&rsquo;t answer this question. I can answer it myself. Frigga, my heart. Can I have a coffee, please? I don&rsquo;t think my back can take it anymore,&rdquo; Odin said and sat at the head of the table. &ldquo;Of course, my dear,&rdquo; Frigga smiled and put the cup in front of Odin.  </p><p>While Odin and Frigga unpacked their clothes, Thor, his friends, Loki and Tony disappeared in the garden to eliminate the chaos.  </p><p>&ldquo;Which of you idiots threw up in the pool, please?&rdquo; rumbled Thor. &ldquo;That was you, my dear Thor. After Tasha had made you one of her well-known mixtures,&rdquo; Tony laughed and hit Thor on the shoulder. &ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; grumbled Thor. &ldquo;What? The party or Natasha&rsquo;s mix?&rdquo; Loki smiled and picked up a plastic cup. &ldquo;Both. Brother, you are the sensible one of us. Please hold me off next time,&rdquo; said Thor, looking desperately at his younger brother. &ldquo;If only you would listen to me,&rdquo; Loki said and continued stuffing cups into the garbage bag.  </p><p>Together they cleaned up the garden as quickly as possible. And when the lawn was free of garbage and the vomit had disappeared from the pool, they all sat down on the benches and loungers. &ldquo;So you had sex yesterday,&rdquo; Sif grinned and looked at Tony, then at Loki. Loki twisted his eyes. &ldquo;Sif. I beg you,&rdquo; Thor said. There would be a lot more discussions, Loki knew that. &ldquo;What? I want to know! The ice princess has finally melted. How many people tried it at home and all failed. Either on you or they froze to death in the vast ice desert in which Loki&rsquo;s heart lies,&rdquo; Fandral said. &ldquo;Fandral, I beg you. Don&rsquo;t make these comparisons. I certainly wasn&rsquo;t an ice princess,&rdquo; Loki twisted his eyes. &ldquo;Oh no? And how would you describe yourself?&rdquo; the blonde grinned. &ldquo;Please no more Elsa jokes&rdquo;, laughed Tony. &ldquo;Elsa?&rdquo; Loki looked at him confused. &ldquo;You never saw Frozen? Oh baby, you really missed something,&rdquo; grinned Tony. &ldquo;I hate all of you,&rdquo; Loki twisted his eye.</p><p>The day ended as well as it had begun. Loki was happy. Thor hadn&rsquo;t killed anyone and Tony was the pure definition of love. So and no other way, the rest of his life would begin. Tony swore that to himself. </p><p><br /></p><p>Be free to spell any grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes. Like you know, my native Language is German. </p></p>",
