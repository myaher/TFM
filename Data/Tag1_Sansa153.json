You feel her grip tightens as a group of women whisper from beside. \u201cLady Stark will be married to the imp\u201d, one of the ladies spoke in a low voice. Sansa held her head high but you had yours down. </p><p>You went up the stairs away from the garden and the people. </p><p>Walking through for her to say her prayers. \u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>Something happens when everybody finds out</i></p><p><i>See the vulture circling in dark cloud</i></p><p><i>Love&rsquo;s a fragile little flame, it could burn out</i></p><p><i>It could burn out</i></p><p><i>Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes</i></p><p><i>And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p></blockquote><p> \u201cYou seem quite close to lady Stark\u201d, you were midway drinking the wine but settled the cup on the table. </p><p>Tyrion Lannister; there he stands. A man who came from the family that raged war to your lady\u2019s. The man who she married and will have the purpose to birth his child. You hated the Lannisters but Tyrion wasn\u2019t easily hated however you didn\u2019t like him either. A dwarf he is-meaning that he\u2019s been ashamed for it his whole life maybe that\u2019s why you don\u2019t hate him as much. </p><p>You stand up in a hurry. </p><p>\u201cMy lord\u201d, you bow to him but Tyrion gives a smile and dismisses it. You sit down-nervous on why he wants to talk to you. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question\u201d, you frown slightly. </p><p>\u201cWhat question? You haven\u2019t asked one\u201d. You cringe at the way you sounded and slightly afraid of what he\u2019ll say but Tyrion doesn\u2019t show any slight of annoyance just amusement. \u201cYour relation with Sansa\u201d, you\u2019re tense and on the edge. Tyrion seems to sense something but maybe it just you being anxious as always. </p><p>\u201cI have been her handmaiden for a long time\u201d, Tyrion takes a seat next to you. You sigh thinking that you are stuck having to hold a conversation. Tyrion hands a motion for the servant to get him a drink. \u201cWhy are you here my lord?\u201d Tyrion fidgets his fingers; \u201cI was wondering if I could earn her trust&hellip;in a way\u201d. </p><p>Raising your brow at his question to say you\u2019re surprised. Tyrion\u2019s drink is received as you sit up. You gulp your drink then answered him, \u201cSansa&hellip;used to like a lot of things that girls..her age would\u201d. Tyrion nods in acknowledgment having an ear, \u201cDoes she still likes them?\u201d </p><p>You coughed a laugh, \u201cShe did until Joffrey came around\u201d. It took you a moment to become aware of what you said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir! I didn\u2019t mean to insult the king or\u2026\u201d. Tyrion dismisses it with a hand, \u201cJoffrey has known to destroy everything he touches\u201d. Your body relaxes-Tyrion isn\u2019t so bad like he seems but you had your guards up but. </p><p>Tyrion wasn\u2019t as bad that\u2019s something you would have to admit, In fact you enjoy his company.</p><p>People were judging you because you laughed loudly. Tyrion tells another story of him and his whores while you drank. \u201cAnd then I vomited all over her\u201d, the wine spits out of your mouth. Tyrion slightly backs away but laughs and you did the same. </p><p>Leveling your hand to your chin to catch any wine that spilled-Tyrion grabs you a cloth which you wiped with. </p><p>Sansa comes storming over, it seems she had a chance of meeting Joffrey along the way. \u201cI want to leave\u201d. Obvious to everyone she seems distressed and close to tears. You stand up, saying goodbye to Tyrion who wishes you a good day. </p><blockquote><p><i>Baby I know places we won&rsquo;t be found and they&rsquo;ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin&rsquo; to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p><p><i>I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>Walking to her chamber; she rushes in the room. Sansa lets herself fall to to the bed and sobs. </p><p>You close the door approaching the bed and laying next to her. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u201d, you call out for her in a low voice. She responds by burying her head on your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWas it Joffrey?\u201d She shakes her head; \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u201d. Her head rises-you see the tears sticking to her face; some of her hair strands glued to her face. </p><p>Using your thumb to remove the tears and take any strands away. </p><p>Her lips meet yours; you stay still for a moment but respond. \u201cMake me forget\u201d, she whispers to your lips. \u201cMake me forget their monastery and dirty words\u201d. </p><p>You only response by brushing your lips together. </p><p>\u201cLady Sans-\u201d, Shae stops midway. You pull away from Sansa covering your bare chest as she freezes like a deer at headlights. Shae lips turn up-smiling as if she\u2019s in relief. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it\u201d, Shae walks away closing the door behind her. </p><blockquote><p><i>Lights flash on the run for the fences</i></p><p><i>Let them say what they want, we won&rsquo;t hear it</i></p><p><i>Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time</i></p></blockquote><p> You stood close to a man named Oberyn Martell. </p><p>He and his wife didn\u2019t lose the chance flirting with you. She ran her fingers up your arm; \u201cYour way of acting seems as if&hellip;you enjoy it\u201d, your fingers hold hers only to move it away. \u201cAre you with someone?\u201d You didn\u2019t respond close to choking on air. \u201cN-no\u201d, Oberyn caught your hesitation, \u201cForbidden isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>Your eyes land on Sansa who returns your gaze; Oberyn smirks. You are an idiot-you just revealed your affair to Sansa. Oberyn simply pats your shoulder and leaves you to it. You glance at Sansa to notice her still gazing at you-you only offered her a smile. Sansa doesn\u2019t return the gesture making you frown but you realized it could raise suspicions. </p><blockquote><p><i>Just grab my hand and don&rsquo;t ever drop it</i></p><p><i>My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p><p><i>Baby I know places we won&rsquo;t be found and they&rsquo;ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin&rsquo; to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>Joffrey must have been the biggest fool to ever exist. </p><p>One minute he announces the wedding is a serious event the next he brings a show filled with dwarves acting as kings. </p><p>What did Joffrey enjoy when doing this to Sansa? Pleasure? Power? </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t show a slight emotion but everything could be seen through her eyes. </p><p>Many laughed and a man gagged on his drink; slamming his fists on the table next to you. Out of disgust you sneered at the man but reminded yourself not to cause any trouble. You wished for Sansa and your eyes to meet but it\u2019s as if she\u2019s frozen-not functioning. Joffrey was howling with laughter-you didn\u2019t miss the look Margaery\u2019s face once he turned his back on her. </p><p>It all happened in a moment; Tyrion was being humiliated and the next thing Joffrey\u2019s holding for breath. The kings-guard Jaime runs to Joffrey so does his mother. </p><p>Your eyes widen when a man comes from behind Sansa; her look tells you everything. </p><p>He pulls her away and you notice her urge to stay to call out for you. \u201cSansa\u201d, you mutter to yourself-calling out for her hoping she would hear you. </p><p>Without a second though you sprint to her direction. Everyone\u2019s too busy or simply shocked to notice any other movement. Just the fact their king was poisoned. </p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d </p><p>You gasp for air; your dress was torn. Mud and dirt were to be seen-your hair is untamed. Sansa breathed, she smiles with nearly tears. </p><p>\u201cWe need to leave\u201d \u201cNot without her\u201d, The man takes a look at you and gives you a motion. </p><p>You get into the boat with Sansa as your arms intertwined with another.As soon as you reach the ship-you were welcomed into a room. You scowled when you see Petyr Baelish other known as Littlefinger approaching you both. So it was him who did it, his idea. \u201cDon\u2019t trust him\u201d, you mumble to Sansa. </p><blockquote><p><i>They are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p><p><i>Just grab my hand and don&rsquo;t ever drop it</i></p><p><i>My love</i></p></blockquote><p>You enter the room after a \u2018come in\u2019 to see Sansa in all her glory bathing. \u201cYour aunt seems like-\u201d \u201cLike she hates me\u201d, you shrug and nod at the same time. \u201cShe hates my mother\u201d, Her voice sounds bitter. Sansa scrubs her arms a bit too rough, you interrupted her. Taking the cloth from her you gently rub the cloth across her arms to her shoulder. </p><p>Sansa remains silent for a while. </p><p>\u201cWill you join me?\u201d You were mildly surprised at her invitation. \u201cPardon me\u201d, Sansa quickly denies but you stop her by standing tall to undress yourself. You join her and sigh in bliss when the hot water welcomes your body. It\u2019s as if the world that rested on your shoulders weren\u2019t as heavy. </p><p>Sansa comes to your open arms; resting her forehead to your shoulder. </p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for the rest of the evening-it was just silence. </p><blockquote><p><i>Baby I know places we won&rsquo;t be found and they&rsquo;ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin&rsquo; to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p><p><i>I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>You stood affront of her, trying not shed any tears. She was horrified all the facade she held was gone. </p><p>Your hair was cut short, only wearing a an old dress that was rag and torn, your eyes were swollen with bags under it. </p><p>\u201cCome serve me a drink\u201d, Ramsay demands. With shaking hands you pour him a drink, \u201cThe same to my lovely wife\u201d, the sarcasm is noted but you obliged refusing to look at her. </p><p>After this you walk Sansa to her room while Ramsay goes hunting for \u2018animals\u2019. \u201cY/N?\u201d Sansa seeks for you, not for you to answer but wishing that you still had your name. </p><p>Your eyes refused to look at hers, you could feel her voice starting to quiver and shake. </p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave&hellip;please\u201d, she pleads for you. When you didn\u2019t answer-she wraps her arm around you sobbing.

Sansa held her head high but you had yours down. </p><p>You went up the stairs away from the garden and the people. </p><p>Walking through for her to say her prayers. \u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>Something happens when everybody finds out</i></p><p><i>See the vulture circling in dark cloud</i></p><p><i>Love\u2019s a fragile little flame, it could burn out</i></p><p><i>It could burn out</i></p><p><i>Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes</i></p><p><i>And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p></blockquote><p> \u201cYou seem quite close to lady Stark\u201d, you were midway drinking the wine but settled the cup on the table. </p><p>Tyrion Lannister; there he stands. A man who came from the family that raged war to your lady\u2019s. The man who she married and will have the purpose to birth his child. You hated the Lannisters but Tyrion wasn\u2019t easily hated however you didn\u2019t like him either. A dwarf he is-meaning that he\u2019s been ashamed for it his whole life maybe that\u2019s why you don\u2019t hate him as much. </p><p>You stand up in a hurry. </p><p>\u201cMy lord\u201d, you bow to him but Tyrion gives a smile and dismisses it. You sit down-nervous on why he wants to talk to you. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question\u201d, you frown slightly. </p><p>\u201cWhat question? You haven\u2019t asked one\u201d. You cringe at the way you sounded and slightly afraid of what he\u2019ll say but Tyrion doesn\u2019t show any slight of annoyance just amusement. \u201cYour relation with Sansa\u201d, you\u2019re tense and on the edge. Tyrion seems to sense something but maybe it just you being anxious as always. </p><p>\u201cI have been her handmaiden for a long time\u201d, Tyrion takes a seat next to you. You sigh thinking that you are stuck having to hold a conversation. Tyrion hands a motion for the servant to get him a drink. \u201cWhy are you here my lord?\u201d Tyrion fidgets his fingers; \u201cI was wondering if I could earn her trust\u2026in a way\u201d. </p><p>Raising your brow at his question to say you\u2019re surprised. Tyrion\u2019s drink is received as you sit up. You gulp your drink then answered him, \u201cSansa\u2026used to like a lot of things that girls..her age would\u201d. Tyrion nods in acknowledgment having an ear, \u201cDoes she still likes them?\u201d </p><p>You coughed a laugh, \u201cShe did until Joffrey came around\u201d. It took you a moment to become aware of what you said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir! I didn\u2019t mean to insult the king or\u2026\u201d. Tyrion dismisses it with a hand, \u201cJoffrey has known to destroy everything he touches\u201d. Your body relaxes-Tyrion isn\u2019t so bad like he seems but you had your guards up but. </p><p>Tyrion wasn\u2019t as bad that\u2019s something you would have to admit, In fact you enjoy his company.</p><p>People were judging you because you laughed loudly. Tyrion tells another story of him and his whores while you drank. \u201cAnd then I vomited all over her\u201d, the wine spits out of your mouth. Tyrion slightly backs away but laughs and you did the same. </p><p>Leveling your hand to your chin to catch any wine that spilled-Tyrion grabs you a cloth which you wiped with. </p><p>Sansa comes storming over, it seems she had a chance of meeting Joffrey along the way. \u201cI want to leave\u201d. Obvious to everyone she seems distressed and close to tears. You stand up, saying goodbye to Tyrion who wishes you a good day. </p><blockquote><p><i>Baby I know places we won\u2019t be found and they\u2019ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin\u2019 to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p><p><i>I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>Walking to her chamber; she rushes in the room. Sansa lets herself fall to to the bed and sobs. </p><p>You close the door approaching the bed and laying next to her. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u201d, you call out for her in a low voice. She responds by burying her head on your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWas it Joffrey?\u201d She shakes her head; \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u201d. Her head rises-you see the tears sticking to her face; some of her hair strands glued to her face. </p><p>Using your thumb to remove the tears and take any strands away. </p><p>Her lips meet yours; you stay still for a moment but respond. \u201cMake me forget\u201d, she whispers to your lips. \u201cMake me forget their monastery and dirty words\u201d. </p><p>You only response by brushing your lips together. </p><p>\u201cLady Sans-\u201d, Shae stops midway. You pull away from Sansa covering your bare chest as she freezes like a deer at headlights. Shae lips turn up-smiling as if she\u2019s in relief. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it\u201d, Shae walks away closing the door behind her. </p><blockquote><p><i>Lights flash on the run for the fences</i></p><p><i>Let them say what they want, we won\u2019t hear it</i></p><p><i>Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time</i></p></blockquote><p> You stood close to a man named Oberyn Martell. </p><p>He and his wife didn\u2019t lose the chance flirting with you. She ran her fingers up your arm; \u201cYour way of acting seems as if\u2026you enjoy it\u201d, your fingers hold hers only to move it away. \u201cAre you with someone?\u201d You didn\u2019t respond close to choking on air. \u201cN-no\u201d, Oberyn caught your hesitation, \u201cForbidden isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>Your eyes land on Sansa who returns your gaze; Oberyn smirks. You are an idiot-you just revealed your affair to Sansa. Oberyn simply pats your shoulder and leaves you to it. You glance at Sansa to notice her still gazing at you-you only offered her a smile. Sansa doesn\u2019t return the gesture making you frown but you realized it could raise suspicions. </p><blockquote><p><i>Just grab my hand and don\u2019t ever drop it</i></p><p><i>My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p><p><i>Baby I know places we won\u2019t be found and they\u2019ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin\u2019 to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>Joffrey must have been the biggest fool to ever exist. </p><p>One minute he announces the wedding is a serious event the next he brings a show filled with dwarves acting as kings. </p><p>What did Joffrey enjoy when doing this to Sansa? Pleasure? Power? </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t show a slight emotion but everything could be seen through her eyes. </p><p>Many laughed and a man gagged on his drink; slamming his fists on the table next to you. Out of disgust you sneered at the man but reminded yourself not to cause any trouble. You wished for Sansa and your eyes to meet but it\u2019s as if she\u2019s frozen-not functioning. Joffrey was howling with laughter-you didn\u2019t miss the look Margaery\u2019s face once he turned his back on her. </p><p>It all happened in a moment; Tyrion was being humiliated and the next thing Joffrey\u2019s holding for breath. The kings-guard Jaime runs to Joffrey so does his mother. </p><p>Your eyes widen when a man comes from behind Sansa; her look tells you everything. </p><p>He pulls her away and you notice her urge to stay to call out for you. \u201cSansa\u201d, you mutter to yourself-calling out for her hoping she would hear you. </p><p>Without a second though you sprint to her direction. Everyone\u2019s too busy or simply shocked to notice any other movement. Just the fact their king was poisoned. </p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d </p><p>You gasp for air; your dress was torn. Mud and dirt were to be seen-your hair is untamed. Sansa breathed, she smiles with nearly tears. </p><p>\u201cWe need to leave\u201d \u201cNot without her\u201d, The man takes a look at you and gives you a motion. </p><p>You get into the boat with Sansa as your arms intertwined with another.As soon as you reach the ship-you were welcomed into a room. You scowled when you see Petyr Baelish other known as Littlefinger approaching you both. So it was him who did it, his idea. \u201cDon\u2019t trust him\u201d, you mumble to Sansa. </p><blockquote><p><i>They are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p><p><i>Just grab my hand and don\u2019t ever drop it</i></p><p><i>My love</i></p></blockquote><p>You enter the room after a \u2018come in\u2019 to see Sansa in all her glory bathing. \u201cYour aunt seems like-\u201d \u201cLike she hates me\u201d, you shrug and nod at the same time. \u201cShe hates my mother\u201d, Her voice sounds bitter. Sansa scrubs her arms a bit too rough, you interrupted her. Taking the cloth from her you gently rub the cloth across her arms to her shoulder. </p><p>Sansa remains silent for a while. </p><p>\u201cWill you join me?\u201d You were mildly surprised at her invitation. \u201cPardon me\u201d, Sansa quickly denies but you stop her by standing tall to undress yourself. You join her and sigh in bliss when the hot water welcomes your body. It\u2019s as if the world that rested on your shoulders weren\u2019t as heavy. </p><p>Sansa comes to your open arms; resting her forehead to your shoulder. </p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for the rest of the evening-it was just silence. </p><blockquote><p><i>Baby I know places we won\u2019t be found and they\u2019ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin\u2019 to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p><p><i>I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>You stood affront of her, trying not shed any tears. She was horrified all the facade she held was gone. </p><p>Your hair was cut short, only wearing a an old dress that was rag and torn, your eyes were swollen with bags under it. </p><p>\u201cCome serve me a drink\u201d, Ramsay demands. With shaking hands you pour him a drink, \u201cThe same to my lovely wife\u201d, the sarcasm is noted but you obliged refusing to look at her. </p><p>After this you walk Sansa to her room while Ramsay goes hunting for \u2018animals\u2019. \u201cY/N?\u201d Sansa seeks for you, not for you to answer but wishing that you still had your name. </p><p>Your eyes refused to look at hers, you could feel her voice starting to quiver and shake. </p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave\u2026please\u201d, she pleads for you. When you didn\u2019t answer-she wraps her arm around you sobbing. Your hands slowly reach up to rest on her back. </p><p>Sansa and you separate; you try your best to smile but it ends up being crooked. </p><p>Sansa sobs start to become heavy. You weren\u2019t gone yet. You were still here. You were still Y/N. You\u2019re still with her. </p><p>Ramsay will pay-Sansa thought and he will be shown no mercy. </p></p>",

Joffrey was howling with laughter-you didn\u2019t miss the look Margaery\u2019s face once he turned his back on her. </p><p>It all happened in a moment; Tyrion was being humiliated and the next thing Joffrey\u2019s holding for breath. The kings-guard Jaime runs to Joffrey so does his mother. </p><p>Your eyes widen when a man comes from behind Sansa; her look tells you everything. </p><p>He pulls her away and you notice her urge to stay to call out for you. \u201cSansa\u201d, you mutter to yourself-calling out for her hoping she would hear you. </p><p>Without a second though you sprint to her direction. Everyone\u2019s too busy or simply shocked to notice any other movement. Just the fact their king was poisoned. </p><p>\u201cSansa!\u201d </p><p>You gasp for air; your dress was torn. Mud and dirt were to be seen-your hair is untamed. Sansa breathed, she smiles with nearly tears. </p><p>\u201cWe need to leave\u201d \u201cNot without her\u201d, The man takes a look at you and gives you a motion. </p><p>You get into the boat with Sansa as your arms intertwined with another.As soon as you reach the ship-you were welcomed into a room. You scowled when you see Petyr Baelish other known as Littlefinger approaching you both. So it was him who did it, his idea. \u201cDon\u2019t trust him\u201d, you mumble to Sansa. </p><blockquote><p><i>They are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p><p><i>Just grab my hand and don\u2019t ever drop it</i></p><p><i>My love</i></p></blockquote><p>You enter the room after a \u2018come in\u2019 to see Sansa in all her glory bathing. \u201cYour aunt seems like-\u201d \u201cLike she hates me\u201d, you shrug and nod at the same time. \u201cShe hates my mother\u201d, Her voice sounds bitter. Sansa scrubs her arms a bit too rough, you interrupted her. Taking the cloth from her you gently rub the cloth across her arms to her shoulder. </p><p>Sansa remains silent for a while. </p><p>\u201cWill you join me?\u201d You were mildly surprised at her invitation. \u201cPardon me\u201d, Sansa quickly denies but you stop her by standing tall to undress yourself. You join her and sigh in bliss when the hot water welcomes your body. It\u2019s as if the world that rested on your shoulders weren\u2019t as heavy. </p><p>Sansa comes to your open arms; resting her forehead to your shoulder. </p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for the rest of the evening-it was just silence. </p><blockquote><p><i>Baby I know places we won\u2019t be found and they\u2019ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin\u2019 to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p><p><i>I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>You stood affront of her, trying not shed any tears. She was horrified all the facade she held was gone. </p><p>Your hair was cut short, only wearing a an old dress that was rag and torn, your eyes were swollen with bags under it. </p><p>\u201cCome serve me a drink\u201d, Ramsay demands. With shaking hands you pour him a drink, \u201cThe same to my lovely wife\u201d, the sarcasm is noted but you obliged refusing to look at her. </p><p>After this you walk Sansa to her room while Ramsay goes hunting for \u2018animals\u2019. \u201cY/N?\u201d Sansa seeks for you, not for you to answer but wishing that you still had your name. </p><p>Your eyes refused to look at hers, you could feel her voice starting to quiver and shake. </p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave\u2026please\u201d, she pleads for you. When you didn\u2019t answer-she wraps her arm around you sobbing. Your hands slowly reach up to rest on her back. </p><p>Sansa and you separate; you try your best to smile but it ends up being crooked. </p><p>Sansa sobs start to become heavy. You weren\u2019t gone yet. You were still here. You were still Y/N. You\u2019re still with her. </p><p>Ramsay will pay-Sansa thought and he will be shown no mercy. </p></p>",

You feel her grip tightens as a group of women whisper from beside. &ldquo;Lady Stark will be married to the imp&rdquo;, one of the ladies spoke in a low voice. Sansa held her head high but you had yours down. </p><p>You went up the stairs away from the garden and the people. </p><p>Walking through for her to say her prayers. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>Something happens when everybody finds out</i></p><p><i>See the vulture circling in dark cloud</i></p><p><i>Love&rsquo;s a fragile little flame, it could burn out</i></p><p><i>It could burn out</i></p><p><i>Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes</i></p><p><i>And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p></blockquote><p> &ldquo;You seem quite close to lady Stark&rdquo;, you were midway drinking the wine but settled the cup on the table. </p><p>Tyrion Lannister; there he stands. A man who came from the family that raged war to your lady&rsquo;s. The man who she married and will have the purpose to birth his child. You hated the Lannisters but Tyrion wasn&rsquo;t easily hated however you didn&rsquo;t like him either. A dwarf he is-meaning that he&rsquo;s been ashamed for it his whole life maybe that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t hate him as much. </p><p>You stand up in a hurry. </p><p>&ldquo;My lord&rdquo;, you bow to him but Tyrion gives a smile and dismisses it. You sit down-nervous on why he wants to talk to you. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t answered my question&rdquo;, you frown slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;What question? You haven&rsquo;t asked one&rdquo;. You cringe at the way you sounded and slightly afraid of what he&rsquo;ll say but Tyrion doesn&rsquo;t show any slight of annoyance just amusement. &ldquo;Your relation with Sansa&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re tense and on the edge. Tyrion seems to sense something but maybe it just you being anxious as always. </p><p>&ldquo;I have been her handmaiden for a long time&rdquo;, Tyrion takes a seat next to you. You sigh thinking that you are stuck having to hold a conversation. Tyrion hands a motion for the servant to get him a drink. &ldquo;Why are you here my lord?&rdquo; Tyrion fidgets his fingers; &ldquo;I was wondering if I could earn her trust&hellip;in a way&rdquo;. </p><p>Raising your brow at his question to say you&rsquo;re surprised. Tyrion&rsquo;s drink is received as you sit up. You gulp your drink then answered him, &ldquo;Sansa&hellip;used to like a lot of things that girls..her age would&rdquo;. Tyrion nods in acknowledgment having an ear, &ldquo;Does she still likes them?&rdquo; </p><p>You coughed a laugh, &ldquo;She did until Joffrey came around&rdquo;. It took you a moment to become aware of what you said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir! I didn&rsquo;t mean to insult the king or&hellip;&rdquo;. Tyrion dismisses it with a hand, &ldquo;Joffrey has known to destroy everything he touches&rdquo;. Your body relaxes-Tyrion isn&rsquo;t so bad like he seems but you had your guards up but. </p><p>Tyrion wasn&rsquo;t as bad that&rsquo;s something you would have to admit, In fact you enjoy his company.</p><p>People were judging you because you laughed loudly. Tyrion tells another story of him and his whores while you drank. &ldquo;And then I vomited all over her&rdquo;, the wine spits out of your mouth. Tyrion slightly backs away but laughs and you did the same. </p><p>Leveling your hand to your chin to catch any wine that spilled-Tyrion grabs you a cloth which you wiped with. </p><p>Sansa comes storming over, it seems she had a chance of meeting Joffrey along the way. &ldquo;I want to leave&rdquo;. Obvious to everyone she seems distressed and close to tears. You stand up, saying goodbye to Tyrion who wishes you a good day. </p><blockquote><p><i>Baby I know places we won&rsquo;t be found and they&rsquo;ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin&rsquo; to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p><p><i>I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>Walking to her chamber; she rushes in the room. Sansa lets herself fall to to the bed and sobs. </p><p>You close the door approaching the bed and laying next to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&rdquo;, you call out for her in a low voice. She responds by burying her head on your shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Was it Joffrey?&rdquo; She shakes her head; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s everyone&rdquo;. Her head rises-you see the tears sticking to her face; some of her hair strands glued to her face. </p><p>Using your thumb to remove the tears and take any strands away. </p><p>Her lips meet yours; you stay still for a moment but respond. &ldquo;Make me forget&rdquo;, she whispers to your lips. &ldquo;Make me forget their monastery and dirty words&rdquo;. </p><p>You only response by brushing your lips together. </p><p>&ldquo;Lady Sans-&rdquo;, Shae stops midway. You pull away from Sansa covering your bare chest as she freezes like a deer at headlights. Shae lips turn up-smiling as if she&rsquo;s in relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you to it&rdquo;, Shae walks away closing the door behind her. </p><blockquote><p><i>Lights flash on the run for the fences</i></p><p><i>Let them say what they want, we won&rsquo;t hear it</i></p><p><i>Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time</i></p></blockquote><p> You stood close to a man named Oberyn Martell. </p><p>He and his wife didn&rsquo;t lose the chance flirting with you. She ran her fingers up your arm; &ldquo;Your way of acting seems as if&hellip;you enjoy it&rdquo;, your fingers hold hers only to move it away. &ldquo;Are you with someone?&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t respond close to choking on air. &ldquo;N-no&rdquo;, Oberyn caught your hesitation, &ldquo;Forbidden isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p><p>Your eyes land on Sansa who returns your gaze; Oberyn smirks. You are an idiot-you just revealed your affair to Sansa. Oberyn simply pats your shoulder and leaves you to it. You glance at Sansa to notice her still gazing at you-you only offered her a smile. Sansa doesn&rsquo;t return the gesture making you frown but you realized it could raise suspicions. </p><blockquote><p><i>Just grab my hand and don&rsquo;t ever drop it</i></p><p><i>My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes</i></p><p><i>And we run</i></p><p><i>Baby I know places we won&rsquo;t be found and they&rsquo;ll be</i></p><p><i>Chasing their tails tryin&rsquo; to track us down</i></p><p><i>Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places</i></p></blockquote><p>Joffrey must have been the biggest fool to ever exist. </p><p>One minute he announces the wedding is a serious event the next he brings a show filled with dwarves acting as kings. </p><p>What did Joffrey enjoy when doing this to Sansa? Pleasure? Power? </p><p>Sansa didn&rsquo;t show a slight emotion but everything could be seen through her eyes. </p><p>Many laughed and a man gagged on his drink; slamming his fists on the table next to you.

        "answer": "<p>Sansa the Oppressor is one of my least favourite things alongside Sansa the Chambermaid and Sansa the Traitor. It requires people to ignore canon or the context of the quotes that keep getting passed around (I remember one asshole who pretends to be a Sansa fan making a post of quotes from Sansa III in AGoT and adding the few Arya quotes in which she\u2019s not calling Sansa stupid). Sansa called Jon a bastard to explain his jealousy towards Joffrey and she was right. Not only that but bastard has been used as a reference to Jon in his siblings\u2019 POV and you don\u2019t see people writing posts about how they were Jon\u2019s abusers. I think Sansa and Jon had a distant relationship with one another and in which they barely interacted and when they did they were polite to each other.

Sansa\u2019s usual reaction to Arya when they\u2019re having an argument is a type of silent treatment where she\u2019d ignore her and reply curtly once in a while. The only exception was in Sansa III when Sansa was reminded of the Trident incident where her direwolf was killed and she explodes in anger especially when Ned tells her that the betrothal was broken. As for Sansa not caring about Arya, I really don\u2019t see the problem. Not only does she try not to think of family members, she also never had a good relationship with Arya. Sometimes family members don\u2019t like each other. You don\u2019t see me forming at the mouth whenever Arya is dismissive of Sansa. Arya doesn\u2019t like Sansa, that\u2019s OK with me.</p>",

The problem with your claim is that we got a Sansa who is both loyal to Jon and who expresses opinions that Jon doesn\u2019t agree with. That\u2019s it!

In fact two different factions offer Sansa the crown and she rejects both. Sansa of course didn\u2019t trust Littlefinger but when the North offered her queenship, it would have made a lot of sense for Sansa to take since their king was a hostage but she didn\u2019t which is apparently a crime to people like you.</p><p>As for calling out Jon\u2019s decisions, Jon made them on his own and then told everyone. Sansa wasn\u2019t the only one who objected and she didn\u2019t object for no good reason. Jon was failing to reward supporters which came back to bite him like 3 episodes later. Then Jon started bitching at Sansa (and Sansa alone) for daring to question him publicly. He didn\u2019t take into account that he was making the decision right there and then and that it wouldn\u2019t make sense for him to take it back later should Sansa or the lords convince him to so she really only had that meeting to speak up. The second time Jon made a spontaneous decision (one he had a perfect opportunity to speak to Sansa about- you know when he got Tyrion\u2019s letter), he decided, despite being a fucking king, he\u2019ll go to Daenerys with a handful of men. Sansa told him to be reasonable and send emissaries because Targaryens have a violent history, they didn\u2019t know Daenerys and Tyrion subtly threatened them in his letter. Sansa relenting when Jon named her regent isn\u2019t side eye worthy at all because it was obvious by then he had made his mind up.</p><p>People like you and other antis have a very different moral standard for Sansa that shifts and changes so that even when she does what you want, you crucify her for not doing it enough or you find a different reason all together.</p>",
