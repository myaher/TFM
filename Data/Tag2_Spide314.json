Someone who isn\u2019t afraid to stand up for the small guy, or the big guy if they needs it. He also finds intelligence attractive. It doesn\u2019t have to be academic intelligence either, blow the boy away with random facts or street smarts and he\u2019s wearing heart eye glasses</p><p><b>B - Baby (do they want a family?)</b></p><p>Yes, yes he does. He\u2019s such a family person. He wants to wait until he finds the perfect person though. Be it a man, woman or otherwise he wants someone he knows he can raise children with. Of course, if he was with someone who didn\u2019t want kids he\u2019d never pressure them</p><p><b>C - Cuddle (how they cuddle)</b></p><p>He will either wrap around you like a koala or he\u2019ll pull you down to lay on top of him. He loves holding you and it makes him feel like he can keep you safe. After a hard night out however he\u2019ll often curl up on top of you, you can\u2019t resist petting his hair until he falls asleep like that.</p><p><b>D - Dates (what dates with them are like)</b></p><p>Peter tries to make his dates romantic, unfortunately if an emergency pops up this can make things hard. This situation can go one of two ways. If you know he\u2019s Spider-Man you\u2019ll kiss him on the cheek and tell him to go be a hero. If you don\u2019t know he\u2019ll text Ned to fake an emergency and he\u2019ll apologize over and over again while getting ready to go. He\u2019ll already be planning a make up date either way</p><p><b>E - Everything (you are my\u2026)</b></p><p>to peter you\u2019re his reason to keep fighting. When things get hard and he\u2019s not sure he can continue being Spider-Man knowing he\u2019s making the city a little safer for you makes everything worth while for him. Being able to see your smile and be able to just be near you makes him want to fight anyone and everyone who might threaten you</p><p><b>F - Feelings (when they realise that they love you)</b></p><p>Don\u2019t hate me&hellip;.he realized he loved you when he was turning to ash. He may have verbally apologized to Tony but that \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d was really for you. He was sorry there\u2019d be no more dates, sorry he wouldn\u2019t get to kiss to again, wouldn\u2019t be able to see you again. He was sorry he couldn\u2019t one day ask you to marry him or to move in with him. These thoughts were what made him realize in his final moments he was head over heels in love with you. He just hopped you\u2019d meet in another life so he could do it again</p><p><b>G - Gentle (are they gentle?)</b></p><p>He\u2019s the gentles person ever, soft touched, soft kisses, soft cuddles. He never wants to make you feel pressured so everything he does is gentle and caring</p><p><b>H - Hand/hold (how do they hold you? Do they hold hands?)</b></p><p>Peter holds hands any opportunity given to him, he\u2019ll lace your fingers together and squeeze while smiling like a dork at you.</p><p><b>I - Impression (first impression)</b></p><p>His first impression was that you were quiet but clever. You has just snarked to a teacher over a wrong fact and he couldn\u2019t believe his ears. Your first impression was that he was a dork, a cute one to. You had heard about his new LEGO Death Star and immediately thought it was adorable</p><p><b>J - Joker (do they pull pranks?)</b></p><p>He\u2019ll pull harmless pranks, like a mosquito buzzing playing on his phone while you try to find it. Or leaving fake bugs and things (often spiders) where you\u2019ll almost step on them, only to dance away in surprise.

Someone who isn\u2019t afraid to stand up for the small guy, or the big guy if they needs it. He also finds intelligence attractive. It doesn\u2019t have to be academic intelligence either, blow the boy away with random facts or street smarts and he\u2019s wearing heart eye glasses</p><p><b>B - Baby (do they want a family?)</b></p><p>Yes, yes he does. He\u2019s such a family person. He wants to wait until he finds the perfect person though. Be it a man, woman or otherwise he wants someone he knows he can raise children with. Of course, if he was with someone who didn\u2019t want kids he\u2019d never pressure them</p><p><b>C - Cuddle (how they cuddle)</b></p><p>He will either wrap around you like a koala or he\u2019ll pull you down to lay on top of him. He loves holding you and it makes him feel like he can keep you safe. After a hard night out however he\u2019ll often curl up on top of you, you can\u2019t resist petting his hair until he falls asleep like that.</p><p><b>D - Dates (what dates with them are like)</b></p><p>Peter tries to make his dates romantic, unfortunately if an emergency pops up this can make things hard. This situation can go one of two ways. If you know he\u2019s Spider-Man you\u2019ll kiss him on the cheek and tell him to go be a hero. If you don\u2019t know he\u2019ll text Ned to fake an emergency and he\u2019ll apologize over and over again while getting ready to go. He\u2019ll already be planning a make up date either way</p><p><b>E - Everything (you are my\u2026)</b></p><p>to peter you\u2019re his reason to keep fighting. When things get hard and he\u2019s not sure he can continue being Spider-Man knowing he\u2019s making the city a little safer for you makes everything worth while for him. Being able to see your smile and be able to just be near you makes him want to fight anyone and everyone who might threaten you</p><p><b>F - Feelings (when they realise that they love you)</b></p><p>Don\u2019t hate me\u2026.he realized he loved you when he was turning to ash.

He was sorry there\u2019d be no more dates, sorry he wouldn\u2019t get to kiss to again, wouldn\u2019t be able to see you again. He was sorry he couldn\u2019t one day ask you to marry him or to move in with him. These thoughts were what made him realize in his final moments he was head over heels in love with you. He just hopped you\u2019d meet in another life so he could do it again</p><p><b>G - Gentle (are they gentle?)</b></p><p>He\u2019s the gentles person ever, soft touched, soft kisses, soft cuddles. He never wants to make you feel pressured so everything he does is gentle and caring</p><p><b>H - Hand/hold (how do they hold you? Do they hold hands?)</b></p><p>Peter holds hands any opportunity given to him, he\u2019ll lace your fingers together and squeeze while smiling like a dork at you.</p><p><b>I - Impression (first impression)</b></p><p>His first impression was that you were quiet but clever. You has just snarked to a teacher over a wrong fact and he couldn\u2019t believe his ears. Your first impression was that he was a dork, a cute one to. You had heard about his new LEGO Death Star and immediately thought it was adorable</p><p><b>J - Joker (do they pull pranks?)</b></p><p>He\u2019ll pull harmless pranks, like a mosquito buzzing playing on his phone while you try to find it. Or leaving fake bugs and things (often spiders) where you\u2019ll almost step on them, only to dance away in surprise. Of course he\u2019ll only do it if he knows it won\u2019t seriously bother you or cause anything serious to happen</p><p><b>K - Kisses (how they kiss)</b></p><p>Peter will kiss in many different ways.

Of course, if he was with someone who didn&rsquo;t want kids he&rsquo;d never pressure them</p><p><b>C - Cuddle (how they cuddle)</b></p><p>He will either wrap around you like a koala or he&rsquo;ll pull you down to lay on top of him. He loves holding you and it makes him feel like he can keep you safe. After a hard night out however he&rsquo;ll often curl up on top of you, you can&rsquo;t resist petting his hair until he falls asleep like that.</p><p><b>D - Dates (what dates with them are like)</b></p><p>Peter tries to make his dates romantic, unfortunately if an emergency pops up this can make things hard. This situation can go one of two ways. If you know he&rsquo;s Spider-Man you&rsquo;ll kiss him on the cheek and tell him to go be a hero. If you don&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;ll text Ned to fake an emergency and he&rsquo;ll apologize over and over again while getting ready to go. He&rsquo;ll already be planning a make up date either way</p><p><b>E - Everything (you are my&hellip;)</b></p><p>to peter you&rsquo;re his reason to keep fighting. When things get hard and he&rsquo;s not sure he can continue being Spider-Man knowing he&rsquo;s making the city a little safer for you makes everything worth while for him. Being able to see your smile and be able to just be near you makes him want to fight anyone and everyone who might threaten you</p><p><b>F - Feelings (when they realise that they love you)</b></p><p>Don&rsquo;t hate me&hellip;.he realized he loved you when he was turning to ash. He may have verbally apologized to Tony but that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; was really for you. He was sorry there&rsquo;d be no more dates, sorry he wouldn&rsquo;t get to kiss to again, wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see you again. He was sorry he couldn&rsquo;t one day ask you to marry him or to move in with him. These thoughts were what made him realize in his final moments he was head over heels in love with you. He just hopped you&rsquo;d meet in another life so he could do it again</p><p><b>G - Gentle (are they gentle?)</b></p><p>He&rsquo;s the gentles person ever, soft touched, soft kisses, soft cuddles. He never wants to make you feel pressured so everything he does is gentle and caring</p><p><b>H - Hand/hold (how do they hold you? Do they hold hands?)</b></p><p>Peter holds hands any opportunity given to him, he&rsquo;ll lace your fingers together and squeeze while smiling like a dork at you.</p><p><b>I - Impression (first impression)</b></p><p>His first impression was that you were quiet but clever. You has just snarked to a teacher over a wrong fact and he couldn&rsquo;t believe his ears. Your first impression was that he was a dork, a cute one to. You had heard about his new LEGO Death Star and immediately thought it was adorable</p><p><b>J - Joker (do they pull pranks?)</b></p><p>He&rsquo;ll pull harmless pranks, like a mosquito buzzing playing on his phone while you try to find it. Or leaving fake bugs and things (often spiders) where you&rsquo;ll almost step on them, only to dance away in surprise. Of course he&rsquo;ll only do it if he knows it won&rsquo;t seriously bother you or cause anything serious to happen</p><p><b>K - Kisses (how they kiss)</b></p><p>Peter will kiss in many different ways. Sometimes he&rsquo;ll pout until you kiss him, other times he&rsquo;ll pull you in for a hug, kissing your forehead, cheeks then finally your lips.</p><p><b>L - Little things (what little things they love)</b></p><p>He loves how you look when you&rsquo;re concentrated, the little ticks you have are all so adorable to him. Funnily enough your favourite dates are homework dates, you&rsquo;ll both catch each other deep in concentration and just stop for a moment because it&rsquo;s too cute to ignore </p><p><b>M - Memory (favourite memory together)</b></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s favourite memory was when you went on your first date. It was supposed to be a trip to the nearby icecream shop but something much batter had caught your eye. You had ended up on a completely impromptu date but he wouldn&rsquo;t have changed a thing</p><p><b>N - Nickel (do they spoil?)</b></p><p>He spoils you as much as he can, little things he thinks you&rsquo;ll like. Adorable voicemails, homemade presents. Anything he can give to you that he knows you&rsquo;ll like</p><p><b>O - Orange (what color reminds them of you)</b></p><p>Red reminds him of you. It&rsquo;s the primary colour of his suit, the thing that keeps him safe in one way or another. You keep him safe to, in a different but possibly more effective way, red also reminds him of you because you&rsquo;ve made you way into his heart and are staying. </p><p><b>P - Petnames (what petnames they use)</b></p><p>You call him Pete, love, darling. </p><p>He calls you sweetheart, cutie, and babe</p><p><b>Q - Questions ( what are the questions they&rsquo;re always asking?)</b></p><p>Peter likes to make sure you&rsquo;re okay with everything he&rsquo;s doing so he&rsquo;s always asking to make sure. &ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo; &ldquo;may I do this?&rdquo;</p><p><b>R - Remember (their favourite memory of each other)</b></p><p>His favourite memory of you was when you had a movie night. You had been stressed out over finals for a while and he had suggested a movie to help you relax. Halfway through he looked down and you were fast asleep on his lap.</p><p>Your favourite memory was soon after this. You had woken up during the credits to find peter asleep this time. Head tilted to the side, mouth open, little snores. It was the cutest. You wished you&rsquo;d had the brain power to take a picture </p><p><b>S - Sad ( how they cheer themselves/others up)</b></p><p>Peter will put on ridiculous puppet shows for you. He&rsquo;ll use nothing but some silly voices and his hands. The effort he puts into them and the silly stories he tells always cheer you up.</p><p>He cheers himself up by thinking of you, May, Ned. The people he loves. He can&rsquo;t possibly stay upset when he&rsquo;s thinking about your smile, or Ned&rsquo;s ridiculous Spider-Man questions or how much May &ldquo;Larbs&rdquo; him</p><p><b>T - Talking ( what they love to talk about)</b></p><p>He loves to talk about the avengers and his hero work. But only if you know who he is. If not he keeps those topics to Ned and instead will geek out about something with you instead. Either way he gets way too adorably excited. </p><p><b>U - Universe ( a metaphor)</b></p><p>The stars in the sky don&rsquo;t shine as brightly as you </p><p><b>V - Very ( thoughts about each other)</b></p><p>You think he&rsquo;s very brave, if not for being Spider-Man than for not being afraid to be who he is. </p><p><b>W - Why ( reasons why they love you)</b></p><p>He loves you because you&rsquo;re special, you&rsquo;re unique and he adores that. He also adores that you adore Spider-Man, if you know who&rsquo;s behind the mask or not he thinks it&rsquo;s adorable </p><p><b>X - Xylophone (what&rsquo;s their song?)</b></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/1bGOgY1CmiU\">I just called</a> by Stevie Wonder</p><p><b>Y - You (what you are to them)</b></p><p>You&rsquo;re his everything, his reason to fight, his sun and stars. He can&rsquo;t think of enough ways to describe what you are to him </p><p><b>Z - Zebra ( what pet they want to have)</b></p><p>He would love a <strike>spider</strike> dog. Something he can come home to and have it be all wiggy and excited. Something he knows can also protect May while he&rsquo;s gone off to do his hero work</p></p>",
