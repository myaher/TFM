        "body": "<p>so i was def inspired on a post i saw on my dash and i can\u2019t seem to find it so ill just bold the words and see if any of ya\u2019ll can recognize it and then tag me or whatever so i can credit it. also this is like my second attempt at writing and its shit so if u got any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, that\u2019d be helpful.</p><p><b>Warnings:</b>\u00a0fluff?</p><p><b>Characters: </b>Steve (obvs), Sam, Peter P, Clint, Natasha (mentioned), Wanda (mentioned), Tony (mentioned)\u00a0</p><p>**</p><!-- more --><p>You did your best work in teams, even if it was just you and another person. You always believed in people coming together and working towards a common goal.\u00a0</p><p>Fortunately, you also did your best work when it came to combat and marksmanship. You threw the nastiest hooks and landed some of the hardest targets; everyones natural reaction was to fear you, but in reality you were a very nice person. Always laughing and smiling. At least that was when SHIELD was still up and operating.\u00a0</p><p>SHIELD had helped you place yourself in society and they taught you everything you needed to know. In a way they were like your saviors.</p><p>When the whole incident at the Potomac went down and everything was done and destroyed, your body went into a shutdown mode. You were once part of the STRIKE team but were transferred to a GHOST team two months before the whole thing fell. It was sad really, you actually quite liked your team, at least your captain and his red-headed number two. He was always giving pointers and looking out for you and nat was always open for small talk, even if it didn\u2019t seem like it at first. If the captain trusted you, she would be half way there.\u00a0</p><p>After the fall you couldn\u2019t find a stable agenda to hold you up and you felt your life fall into shambles and become disorganized. For a month you would barely eat, sleep, or drink. You looked like shit.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It took a while but you had finally gotten back up on your feet with the help of a couple of self-help groups in the area and had even started up a small self-defense gym in D.C.. It was your passion to help people in need, even if you couldn\u2019t do it on the high level you once used to. You didn\u2019t want to join any other government related agencies like everybody else just so they could do to you the same thing SHIELD did. And so for a while you were content on your average sized two-story gym.</p><p>\u00a0About half a year later, an old colleague came knocking at your door in a beige jacket and some dad jeans,\u00a0\u201cClint? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to a certain playboy with money shooting out his ass, I\u2019m the new recruiter for the Avengers. At least the deal was to recruit you, then I get to retire.\u201d<br/></p><p>You popped your head into the hallway to check for any other\u00a0\u2018visitors\u2019, and once you deemed it\u00a0\u2018safe\u2019 you yanked him into your loft.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStark knows about me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, not really. But a certain captain and arachnid do, and the former has been putting in a very good word as of late. So I came by to see if you were interested.\u201d<br/></p><p>This was big, working with the Avengers was like being at the top of the food chain of helping. One half of your brain lacked impulse and almost blurted out yes before he even finished the sentence, the other half knew better and wanted to take things slowly.</p><p>Clint could see your internal struggle and so he decided that it would be best to pull you from your inner monologues,\u00a0\u201cWell look, if you do decide to at least come and check it out here is the address and a number, make sure to call ahead so you don\u2019t get shot off the road, the cadets might confuse you as a threat. And who knows? There may even be a certain boy scout waiting for you at the front doors,\u201d and with that good old Clint \u201cMaster Recruiter\u201d Barton walked out of your home with his hands in his pocket, whistling like a bird.</p><p>It took about three days before you called the number but it rang to voicemail. All you could do at that point was just leave a simple\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m in\u2019 in the inbox, and you were off.\u00a0</p><p>you packed what few articles of clothing you had into a duffel bag and you tossed the bag into the back of your old blue truck, the journey to upstate New York would be little long, but it felt right.</p><p>***</p><p>Clint was right, a certain boy scout would be waiting there.</p><p>Steve Rogers stood there in his righteous glory with crossed arms and a small smile on his face.\u00a0</p><p>You got out of the truck, slamming the door behind you,\u00a0\u201ca little bird came to my door, told me he was recruiting. He also told me about a certain captain practically chirping about my abilities. \u201d</p><p>He looked away for a second, hiding the fact that he was grinning ear to ear, before facing you again,\u00a0\u201c&hellip;I was not chirping.\u201d</p><p>You just crossed your arms and gave him a look of disbelief. His presence was always so easy going for you. And little did you know you had the same effect on him, you were one of the few people he\u2019d let himself go with, someone who can take it and dish it.</p><p>But then the moment became serious,\u00a0\u201cDid you really mean it? Are you really in?\u201d He almost sounded insecure, as if your answer could affect his life in a negative way.</p><p>\u2018So that was his phone&hellip;\u2019 you thought to your self,\u00a0\u2018Screw you, BirdBrain\u2019. You looked up at Steve and just started walking back towards you truck to retrieve the duffel bag and made you way towards the compound. When you noticed he wasn\u2019t behind you you turned around and asked,\u00a0\u201cWell? Aren\u2019t ya gonna give me a tour scout?\u201d<br/></p><p>Laughing to himself, in what seemed like relief, he picked up his pace to catch up with you.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>That was six months ago. You had become very close with the rest of the team. They acknowledged your talents and you acknowledged theirs. You became really close to Steve, then Sam, since they were basically the same people. Sam just did things slower.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t till about a month ago Tony brought in a child. Well he wasn\u2019t really a child, he was a teenager but all you saw was a little kid who looked like he needed an older sister, and you were more than happy to fill out that role. Sam hated him but Steve found him quite useful in understanding todays pop culture.\u00a0</p><p>You walked into the kitchen while Sam made breakfast, everyone else seemed to be coming in later or they just weren\u2019t morning people (Wanda&ndash; but that\u2019s a tale for another time), yet Peter was hanging from the ceiling and Steve was sitting on the counter.</p><p>Lately things had been strange between you two.He\u2019d be a little bolder with his statements and feelings with you, not that you didn\u2019t like it, it was nice to have someone say nice things to you without wanting anything else out of it. You may even reciprocate those feelings, but its just weird, you were well into your twenties and the only serious relationship you\u2019ve ever had was with that one kid in kindergarten who let you have his juice box.\u00a0</p><p>His attitude became more lax and not at all like the\u00a0\u2018always on red alert\u2019 captain he\u2019d even taken a liking to sitting on the counter, which isn\u2019t like Steve at all. Or at least that\u2019s what you thought, people change, and after Peter came through as an encyclopedia of memes the captain has been soaking in the information like a sponge. And you starting to wonder why he was so adamant on understanding or assimilating to this century\u00a0</p><p>So you walked to the fridge and poured yourself a glass of orange juice, walked by Peter and pushed his shoulder sending him into turns did you ask,\u00a0<b>\u201cSteve, why have you been sitting on the counter lately?\u201d</b>\u00a0</p><p>And without hesitation he answered,<b>\u201cBecause thats where snacks belong\u201d</b><br/></p><p>Which in turn made you spit on peter who happened to turn back around again and face you. In shock and embarrassment you grabbed a bunch of paper towels and shoved them into the boys face as Sam crouched down and started to cough at how much he was laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhere on God\u2019s Green Earth did you get that line from?\u201d you asked in disbelief already knowing the culprit who taught him such words.

Sam hated him but Steve found him quite useful in understanding todays pop culture.\u00a0</p><p>You walked into the kitchen while Sam made breakfast, everyone else seemed to be coming in later or they just weren\u2019t morning people (Wanda\u2013 but that\u2019s a tale for another time), yet Peter was hanging from the ceiling and Steve was sitting on the counter.</p><p>Lately things had been strange between you two.He\u2019d be a little bolder with his statements and feelings with you, not that you didn\u2019t like it, it was nice to have someone say nice things to you without wanting anything else out of it. You may even reciprocate those feelings, but its just weird, you were well into your twenties and the only serious relationship you\u2019ve ever had was with that one kid in kindergarten who let you have his juice box.\u00a0</p><p>His attitude became more lax and not at all like the\u00a0\u2018always on red alert\u2019 captain he\u2019d even taken a liking to sitting on the counter, which isn\u2019t like Steve at all.

Are you really in?&rdquo; He almost sounded insecure, as if your answer could affect his life in a negative way.</p><p>&lsquo;So that was his phone&hellip;&rsquo; you thought to your self,&nbsp;&lsquo;Screw you, BirdBrain&rsquo;. You looked up at Steve and just started walking back towards you truck to retrieve the duffel bag and made you way towards the compound. When you noticed he wasn&rsquo;t behind you you turned around and asked,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well? Aren&rsquo;t ya gonna give me a tour scout?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Laughing to himself, in what seemed like relief, he picked up his pace to catch up with you.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>That was six months ago. You had become very close with the rest of the team. They acknowledged your talents and you acknowledged theirs. You became really close to Steve, then Sam, since they were basically the same people. Sam just did things slower.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t till about a month ago Tony brought in a child. Well he wasn&rsquo;t really a child, he was a teenager but all you saw was a little kid who looked like he needed an older sister, and you were more than happy to fill out that role. Sam hated him but Steve found him quite useful in understanding todays pop culture.&nbsp;</p><p>You walked into the kitchen while Sam made breakfast, everyone else seemed to be coming in later or they just weren&rsquo;t morning people (Wanda&ndash; but that&rsquo;s a tale for another time), yet Peter was hanging from the ceiling and Steve was sitting on the counter.</p><p>Lately things had been strange between you two.He&rsquo;d be a little bolder with his statements and feelings with you, not that you didn&rsquo;t like it, it was nice to have someone say nice things to you without wanting anything else out of it. You may even reciprocate those feelings, but its just weird, you were well into your twenties and the only serious relationship you&rsquo;ve ever had was with that one kid in kindergarten who let you have his juice box.&nbsp;</p><p>His attitude became more lax and not at all like the&nbsp;&lsquo;always on red alert&rsquo; captain he&rsquo;d even taken a liking to sitting on the counter, which isn&rsquo;t like Steve at all. Or at least that&rsquo;s what you thought, people change, and after Peter came through as an encyclopedia of memes the captain has been soaking in the information like a sponge. And you starting to wonder why he was so adamant on understanding or assimilating to this century&nbsp;</p><p>So you walked to the fridge and poured yourself a glass of orange juice, walked by Peter and pushed his shoulder sending him into turns did you ask,&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;Steve, why have you been sitting on the counter lately?&rdquo;</b>&nbsp;</p><p>And without hesitation he answered,<b>&ldquo;Because thats where snacks belong&rdquo;</b><br /></p><p>Which in turn made you spit on peter who happened to turn back around again and face you. In shock and embarrassment you grabbed a bunch of paper towels and shoved them into the boys face as Sam crouched down and started to cough at how much he was laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Where on God&rsquo;s Green Earth did you get that line from?&rdquo; you asked in disbelief already knowing the culprit who taught him such words. The culprit in question was now standing next to you getting orange juice and saliva off of his face.<br /></p><p>Steve just shrugged and walked away saying he was going to find or wake everyone up. Propping himself off the counter he walked away and you got a good view at what his momma gave him.&nbsp;</p><p>Damn, maybe that&rsquo;s where snacks <i>do</i>&nbsp;belong.</p>",
