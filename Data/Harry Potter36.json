He turned his head to gaze over at the alarm clock that still seemed foreign to Draco, but he sure understood the neon 7:45am that glowed bright green off of the digital clock.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you think you\u2019re doing waking me at this ungodly hour?\u201d</p><p>Harry only laughed and set down the tray of breakfast down on Draco\u2019s lap once he had sat up comfortably under the covers of their double bed, gently kissing his head as he did so.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday though, I\u2019ve planned a whole day out for us!\u201d Harry exclaimed, a grin still creasing up his face as he plopped himself down on the bed, cross-legged, next to the scowling blonde who had reluctantly started chewing on his perfectly crispy bacon, secretly enjoying the faint greasiness of it.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s my birthday, that was going to be my excuse to sleep in.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re up now so there\u2019s no use complaining, love. I\u2019ve booked and reserved and stressed non-stop for the last week so we will enjoy today, understood?\u201d Harry had a triumphant look on his face despite the fact that all he had achieved so far was the fact that Draco was eating breakfast by eight o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you planned to make you feel so superior, then?\u201d Draco finally bothered to break from the scowl that was plastered on his face merely seconds ago; Draco could never resist his lover when he looked so blissfully determined as he did now.</p><p>\u201cWe, dear love of mine, are going to have a lovely meal and then we are going to the beach.\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped Draco, almost choking him as he tried to get to grips on the fact that Harry had supposedly spent all week planning that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Harry\u2019s face fell as he watched Draco\u2019s reaction to his gesture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not excited for it, it\u2019s just that i thought you said that you\u2019d spent all week planning that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Harry cried, looking slightly distraught as he crossed his arms defensively across his chest.</p><p>Draco, picking up on this, placed his half-eaten breakfast to one side, crawling over to his boyfriend in order to wrap his arms self-consciously around him. Harry\u2019s eyes wondered up to Draco\u2019s, a small smile slowly crawling across his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so adorable when you\u2019re awkward.\u201d</p><p>The statement made sense in Harry\u2019s head, he just loved complementing everything about his lover. He didn\u2019t really care how much sense he was making when all he could do was stare up into the blonde\u2019s eyes and remember how in love he was. It was stupid really, but Harry knew today\u2019s events would only make him love Draco even more.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As they casually strolled into the shockingly expensive restaurant, Draco couldn\u2019t help but realize how attentive Harry was. This place had met all of Draco\u2019s expectations and then some: glittering chandeliers hung gracefully from the marble ceiling, pillars constructed from the same pearly marble held the ceiling up, the floor was checkered like a chess board and was so clean Draco swore he could see his own reflection in it, the tables were arranged in no particular format but were dotted around in such a way that flowed and calmed Draco. The couple weren\u2019t the only ones that seemed to think so either, as other guests sat at tables which were adorned with gleaming silverware and glasses.</p><p>The waiter swiftly showed them to their seats and took their drink orders, then calmly left them to enjoy their surroundings, not to mention each other as well. For several minutes Draco sat sipping at his white wine, gazing fondly at the stunning venue. Harry merely watched with a soft focus, mind suddenly racing ahead and stressing that something would be suddenly out of place and ruin everything that he had worked so hard to put together, that Draco would hate him for rushing ahead and go ahead and pack up and leave.</p><p>After a while, Draco turned his attention back to messy haired, green-haired beauty that sat before him and grinned. It wasn\u2019t often that Draco grinned, but when he did it lit a spark in Harry\u2019s chest, infecting his mind and eradicating every sense of panic from his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThank you for this, love. It is truly wonderful here.\u201d Draco seemed so sincere in his thanks and his beautifully perfect face was still alight as a child at a sweet shop, and despite his reaction earlier that day, he was truly in awe by the amount of thought Harry had obviously put into this. Curiosity suddenly bloomed in Draco\u2019s mind as he let his mind wonder about Harry\u2019s plans for the rest of the day.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>The meal was an overall success as every element of the meal was precise and beautiful and delicious. conversation flowed between the two as it usually did - not much break for breath or food as the both of them giggled at each others jokes, commentated on the venue, and shared stories of the latest happenings - and smiles were far more commonly spread across Draco\u2019s face than usual.</p><p>After they had paid for their service, the two men took to the streets as they slowly strolled along the pavement towards the bandstand that stood on luscious grass with the sea rippling not too far into the distance. Draco know nothing of this. He had been told that they were off to the beach. He wasn\u2019t even suspicious of Harry\u2019s secrecy.</p><p>As they drew closer to the bandstand, Harry\u2019s nerves went through the roof, despite Draco still beaming from ear to ear. He had obviously lied to Draco. He had been planning this for far longer than a mere week. If he were being completely honest, he had been planning this since he had first realized his feelings for Draco back at Hogwarts.</p><p>Draco\u2019s trance broke as soon as he saw that Harry was no longer listening to a story which he found highly entertaining about a strange encounter he had with a patient at St Mungo\u2019s. Concern immediately was evident in both wizard\u2019s faces as Draco tugged his lover to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice wobbled slightly, and he certainly couldn\u2019t have that continue if he were to continue on to do what he had been planning to do.</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask the same question to you, actually.\u201d Draco responded with an eyebrow-raise for effect.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, babe, I promise. Just thinking about work - I\u2019ve got a bunch of reports due in.\u201d Harry swiftly lied, and he got the effect he so desired when Draco\u2019s sincerity was immediately replaced with a smirk and a snort.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should have gotten on and done them before you spend a week planning for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s shoulders relaxed ever so slightly at his words. He had to remain inconspicuous until they arrived at their destination, which was even harder as Harry remembered that he had to give the others as much time as possible to prepare every last detail.</p><p>They carried on walking with a safe distance between each other as to avoid as much conflict as possible. It was always like this in public, and it killed both of them to have to bear to stay apart. They\u2019d both experienced hate from the wizarding world, and they certainly didn\u2019t need the same response from the muggle world. If that were to happen, then it would be practically impossible for either of them to face the world, magic or no.</p><p>Despite not holding hands, there was far much more eye contact than the average pair of straight men. Small smiles were their secret language of affection and adoration while they couldn\u2019t admit their undying love for each other on their outings, as much as they wanted to.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>As they approached the rocky shores, Harry knew this was where he would have to start letting Draco in on the secret, and Harry\u2019s insecurity indescribably turned into pure excitement and a strange sense of bravery.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going right, actually, Draco.\u201d Harry declared as Draco turned to walk along the pathway to his left. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me we went to the beach to not go to the beach?\u201d Draco\u2019s suspicion was beginning, it was only a matter of time before he started asking more awkward questions.</p><p>\u201cJust trust me, Ok?\u201d Harry said, realizing that was probably the most suspicious thing he could have possibly said. Meanwhile he casually slipped his hands into his coat pockets, his left hand wrapping around the cool metal of the galleon. It sure was a good thing that they had kept those coins from Dumbledore\u2019s Army otherwise he would have no way of communicating their arrival to the others. </p><p>Truth be told, he didn\u2019t have much of a clue what on earth the bandstand would look like once they arrived, Hermione had insisted that it would look a whole lot better if someone more practical and organized were to deal with those sort of small details while Harry had the basic, yet all-important, job of buying the ring.</p><p>The thought of proposing made Harry shiver with anticipation, yet feel sick to his stomach with dread as his one word answer was either a cobbled stone bridge to run hand-in-hand over, both drunk with joy, or it would be a door slammed in Harry\u2019s face with Draco as the receiver on the other side.</p><p>Each step felt heavy and light, tiring yet wiring, a step closer and further. It was torture to endure every step of the way, for both of them. Draco\u2019s every step was filled with curiosity and dread, shivers and burst of heat from Harry\u2019s half glances. Whatever was waiting for him, whatever secret Harry had kept, he had done a bloody good job of hiding it from him. Either that, or Draco was a lot more ignorant than he thought.</p><p>Just before the grassy hill ended, before Draco got even a single glimpse of what lay behind the mound of dirt, Harry stopped himself as well as Draco so he could look at him before he walked on, before it was too late to turn back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very secretive, you know.\u201d Draco looked at his boyfriend as he hopped from one foot to the other, a look of anticipation on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Draco laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re not going to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed back, more of a nervous laugh really: hollow and not one that reached his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just- you know- I- um-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, deep breathes, darling.\u201d Draco chuckled again out of pure amusement of how easily his adorable little messy-haired boyfriend gets anxious.</p><p>\u201cRight, yeah. Well&hellip; I love you Ok? Just keep that in mind while I do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d</p><p>Draco\u2019s confusion snapped to pure wonder and awe within the heartbeat in which he turned to gaze up at the scene before him: fairy lights hung from every inch of the structure, as well as a grinning Luna; peachy pink roses were laced onto the wires, making them glow with the light; everyone was there to greet them, all dressed in fine summer dresses and suits, and they all looked gorgeous in them as well.</p><p>Harry laced his fingers through Draco\u2019s and led him forward so he would be able to see the bold banner hanging boldly from the bandstand ceiling - \u201cMarry me?\u201d</p><p>Draco\u2019s breath caught in his throat, he was completely winded. He couldn\u2019t have read that right. Surely there was some sort of mistake here. Harry wanted to-\u00a0 he wanted- he wanted to marry him?</p><p>He turned to face his lover, his eyes already slightly damp, only to find him kneeling down on one knee, eyes dead-set on Draco, and revealed a small red box. When he slowly opened it, he saw the most beautiful and precious ring he had ever seen in his eyes. </p><p>His eyes went wide and his hand flew to his mouth. He took a few steps back before he finally steadied himself and focused on the beautiful, heartfelt words that were flowing out of Harry\u2019s mouth like he had said them a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cSo Draco, will you marry me?\u201d </p><p>The agony on Harry\u2019s face almost made Draco laugh, though he realized that would practically be a death wish with the seriously low amount of oxygen intake that was taking place with the tears streaming down his face.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course! Merlin, you\u2019re an absolute git, but of course I\u2019ll marry you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Decided to make another fic since I haven\u2019t really done anything in a while, as per usual. Hope it\u2019s ok!</p>",

I\u2019ve booked and reserved and stressed non-stop for the last week so we will enjoy today, understood?\u201d Harry had a triumphant look on his face despite the fact that all he had achieved so far was the fact that Draco was eating breakfast by eight o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you planned to make you feel so superior, then?\u201d Draco finally bothered to break from the scowl that was plastered on his face merely seconds ago; Draco could never resist his lover when he looked so blissfully determined as he did now.</p><p>\u201cWe, dear love of mine, are going to have a lovely meal and then we are going to the beach.\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped Draco, almost choking him as he tried to get to grips on the fact that Harry had supposedly spent all week planning that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Harry\u2019s face fell as he watched Draco\u2019s reaction to his gesture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not excited for it, it\u2019s just that i thought you said that you\u2019d spent all week planning that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Harry cried, looking slightly distraught as he crossed his arms defensively across his chest.</p><p>Draco, picking up on this, placed his half-eaten breakfast to one side, crawling over to his boyfriend in order to wrap his arms self-consciously around him. Harry\u2019s eyes wondered up to Draco\u2019s, a small smile slowly crawling across his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so adorable when you\u2019re awkward.\u201d</p><p>The statement made sense in Harry\u2019s head, he just loved complementing everything about his lover. He didn\u2019t really care how much sense he was making when all he could do was stare up into the blonde\u2019s eyes and remember how in love he was. It was stupid really, but Harry knew today\u2019s events would only make him love Draco even more.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>As they casually strolled into the shockingly expensive restaurant, Draco couldn\u2019t help but realize how attentive Harry was. This place had met all of Draco\u2019s expectations and then some: glittering chandeliers hung gracefully from the marble ceiling, pillars constructed from the same pearly marble held the ceiling up, the floor was checkered like a chess board and was so clean Draco swore he could see his own reflection in it, the tables were arranged in no particular format but were dotted around in such a way that flowed and calmed Draco. The couple weren\u2019t the only ones that seemed to think so either, as other guests sat at tables which were adorned with gleaming silverware and glasses.</p><p>The waiter swiftly showed them to their seats and took their drink orders, then calmly left them to enjoy their surroundings, not to mention each other as well. For several minutes Draco sat sipping at his white wine, gazing fondly at the stunning venue. Harry merely watched with a soft focus, mind suddenly racing ahead and stressing that something would be suddenly out of place and ruin everything that he had worked so hard to put together, that Draco would hate him for rushing ahead and go ahead and pack up and leave.</p><p>After a while, Draco turned his attention back to messy haired, green-haired beauty that sat before him and grinned. It wasn\u2019t often that Draco grinned, but when he did it lit a spark in Harry\u2019s chest, infecting his mind and eradicating every sense of panic from his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThank you for this, love. It is truly wonderful here.\u201d Draco seemed so sincere in his thanks and his beautifully perfect face was still alight as a child at a sweet shop, and despite his reaction earlier that day, he was truly in awe by the amount of thought Harry had obviously put into this. Curiosity suddenly bloomed in Draco\u2019s mind as he let his mind wonder about Harry\u2019s plans for the rest of the day.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>The meal was an overall success as every element of the meal was precise and beautiful and delicious. conversation flowed between the two as it usually did - not much break for breath or food as the both of them giggled at each others jokes, commentated on the venue, and shared stories of the latest happenings - and smiles were far more commonly spread across Draco\u2019s face than usual.</p><p>After they had paid for their service, the two men took to the streets as they slowly strolled along the pavement towards the bandstand that stood on luscious grass with the sea rippling not too far into the distance. Draco know nothing of this. He had been told that they were off to the beach. He wasn\u2019t even suspicious of Harry\u2019s secrecy.</p><p>As they drew closer to the bandstand, Harry\u2019s nerves went through the roof, despite Draco still beaming from ear to ear. He had obviously lied to Draco. He had been planning this for far longer than a mere week. If he were being completely honest, he had been planning this since he had first realized his feelings for Draco back at Hogwarts.</p><p>Draco\u2019s trance broke as soon as he saw that Harry was no longer listening to a story which he found highly entertaining about a strange encounter he had with a patient at St Mungo\u2019s. Concern immediately was evident in both wizard\u2019s faces as Draco tugged his lover to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice wobbled slightly, and he certainly couldn\u2019t have that continue if he were to continue on to do what he had been planning to do.</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask the same question to you, actually.\u201d Draco responded with an eyebrow-raise for effect.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, babe, I promise. Just thinking about work - I\u2019ve got a bunch of reports due in.\u201d Harry swiftly lied, and he got the effect he so desired when Draco\u2019s sincerity was immediately replaced with a smirk and a snort.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should have gotten on and done them before you spend a week planning for my birthday.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s shoulders relaxed ever so slightly at his words. He had to remain inconspicuous until they arrived at their destination, which was even harder as Harry remembered that he had to give the others as much time as possible to prepare every last detail.</p><p>They carried on walking with a safe distance between each other as to avoid as much conflict as possible. It was always like this in public, and it killed both of them to have to bear to stay apart. They\u2019d both experienced hate from the wizarding world, and they certainly didn\u2019t need the same response from the muggle world. If that were to happen, then it would be practically impossible for either of them to face the world, magic or no.</p><p>Despite not holding hands, there was far much more eye contact than the average pair of straight men. Small smiles were their secret language of affection and adoration while they couldn\u2019t admit their undying love for each other on their outings, as much as they wanted to.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>As they approached the rocky shores, Harry knew this was where he would have to start letting Draco in on the secret, and Harry\u2019s insecurity indescribably turned into pure excitement and a strange sense of bravery.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going right, actually, Draco.\u201d Harry declared as Draco turned to walk along the pathway to his left. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me we went to the beach to not go to the beach?\u201d Draco\u2019s suspicion was beginning, it was only a matter of time before he started asking more awkward questions.</p><p>\u201cJust trust me, Ok?\u201d Harry said, realizing that was probably the most suspicious thing he could have possibly said. Meanwhile he casually slipped his hands into his coat pockets, his left hand wrapping around the cool metal of the galleon. It sure was a good thing that they had kept those coins from Dumbledore\u2019s Army otherwise he would have no way of communicating their arrival to the others. </p><p>Truth be told, he didn\u2019t have much of a clue what on earth the bandstand would look like once they arrived, Hermione had insisted that it would look a whole lot better if someone more practical and organized were to deal with those sort of small details while Harry had the basic, yet all-important, job of buying the ring.</p><p>The thought of proposing made Harry shiver with anticipation, yet feel sick to his stomach with dread as his one word answer was either a cobbled stone bridge to run hand-in-hand over, both drunk with joy, or it would be a door slammed in Harry\u2019s face with Draco as the receiver on the other side.</p><p>Each step felt heavy and light, tiring yet wiring, a step closer and further. It was torture to endure every step of the way, for both of them. Draco\u2019s every step was filled with curiosity and dread, shivers and burst of heat from Harry\u2019s half glances. Whatever was waiting for him, whatever secret Harry had kept, he had done a bloody good job of hiding it from him. Either that, or Draco was a lot more ignorant than he thought.</p><p>Just before the grassy hill ended, before Draco got even a single glimpse of what lay behind the mound of dirt, Harry stopped himself as well as Draco so he could look at him before he walked on, before it was too late to turn back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very secretive, you know.\u201d Draco looked at his boyfriend as he hopped from one foot to the other, a look of anticipation on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Draco laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re not going to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed back, more of a nervous laugh really: hollow and not one that reached his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just- you know- I- um-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, deep breathes, darling.\u201d Draco chuckled again out of pure amusement of how easily his adorable little messy-haired boyfriend gets anxious.</p><p>\u201cRight, yeah. Well\u2026 I love you Ok? Just keep that in mind while I do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d</p><p>Draco\u2019s confusion snapped to pure wonder and awe within the heartbeat in which he turned to gaze up at the scene before him: fairy lights hung from every inch of the structure, as well as a grinning Luna; peachy pink roses were laced onto the wires, making them glow with the light; everyone was there to greet them, all dressed in fine summer dresses and suits, and they all looked gorgeous in them as well.</p><p>Harry laced his fingers through Draco\u2019s and led him forward so he would be able to see the bold banner hanging boldly from the bandstand ceiling - \u201cMarry me?\u201d</p><p>Draco\u2019s breath caught in his throat, he was completely winded. He couldn\u2019t have read that right. Surely there was some sort of mistake here. Harry wanted to-\u00a0 he wanted- he wanted to marry him?</p><p>He turned to face his lover, his eyes already slightly damp, only to find him kneeling down on one knee, eyes dead-set on Draco, and revealed a small red box. When he slowly opened it, he saw the most beautiful and precious ring he had ever seen in his eyes. </p><p>His eyes went wide and his hand flew to his mouth. He took a few steps back before he finally steadied himself and focused on the beautiful, heartfelt words that were flowing out of Harry\u2019s mouth like he had said them a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cSo Draco, will you marry me?\u201d </p><p>The agony on Harry\u2019s face almost made Draco laugh, though he realized that would practically be a death wish with the seriously low amount of oxygen intake that was taking place with the tears streaming down his face.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course! Merlin, you\u2019re an absolute git, but of course I\u2019ll marry you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Decided to make another fic since I haven\u2019t really done anything in a while, as per usual. Hope it\u2019s ok!</p>",

Either that, or Draco was a lot more ignorant than he thought.</p><p>Just before the grassy hill ended, before Draco got even a single glimpse of what lay behind the mound of dirt, Harry stopped himself as well as Draco so he could look at him before he walked on, before it was too late to turn back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very secretive, you know.\u201d Draco looked at his boyfriend as he hopped from one foot to the other, a look of anticipation on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Draco laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re not going to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed back, more of a nervous laugh really: hollow and not one that reached his eyes. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just- you know- I- um-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, deep breathes, darling.\u201d Draco chuckled again out of pure amusement of how easily his adorable little messy-haired boyfriend gets anxious.</p><p>\u201cRight, yeah. Well\u2026 I love you Ok? Just keep that in mind while I do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d</p><p>Draco\u2019s confusion snapped to pure wonder and awe within the heartbeat in which he turned to gaze up at the scene before him: fairy lights hung from every inch of the structure, as well as a grinning Luna; peachy pink roses were laced onto the wires, making them glow with the light; everyone was there to greet them, all dressed in fine summer dresses and suits, and they all looked gorgeous in them as well.</p><p>Harry laced his fingers through Draco\u2019s and led him forward so he would be able to see the bold banner hanging boldly from the bandstand ceiling - \u201cMarry me?\u201d</p><p>Draco\u2019s breath caught in his throat, he was completely winded. He couldn\u2019t have read that right. Surely there was some sort of mistake here. Harry wanted to-\u00a0 he wanted- he wanted to marry him?</p><p>He turned to face his lover, his eyes already slightly damp, only to find him kneeling down on one knee, eyes dead-set on Draco, and revealed a small red box. When he slowly opened it, he saw the most beautiful and precious ring he had ever seen in his eyes. </p><p>His eyes went wide and his hand flew to his mouth. He took a few steps back before he finally steadied himself and focused on the beautiful, heartfelt words that were flowing out of Harry\u2019s mouth like he had said them a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cSo Draco, will you marry me?\u201d </p><p>The agony on Harry\u2019s face almost made Draco laugh, though he realized that would practically be a death wish with the seriously low amount of oxygen intake that was taking place with the tears streaming down his face.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course! Merlin, you\u2019re an absolute git, but of course I\u2019ll marry you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Decided to make another fic since I haven\u2019t really done anything in a while, as per usual. Hope it\u2019s ok!</p>",
                "content": "<p>&ldquo;Happy Birthday!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Draco woke with a jump, opening his eyes wide to meet the look of pure joy and excitement that radiated off of his adorable green-eyed boyfriend, still dressed in his blue-and-white-striped pajamas. He turned his head to gaze over at the alarm clock that still seemed foreign to Draco, but he sure understood the neon 7:45am that glowed bright green off of the digital clock.</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth do you think you&rsquo;re doing waking me at this ungodly hour?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry only laughed and set down the tray of breakfast down on Draco&rsquo;s lap once he had sat up comfortably under the covers of their double bed, gently kissing his head as he did so.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your birthday though, I&rsquo;ve planned a whole day out for us!&rdquo; Harry exclaimed, a grin still creasing up his face as he plopped himself down on the bed, cross-legged, next to the scowling blonde who had reluctantly started chewing on his perfectly crispy bacon, secretly enjoying the faint greasiness of it.</p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s my birthday, that was going to be my excuse to sleep in.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re up now so there&rsquo;s no use complaining, love. I&rsquo;ve booked and reserved and stressed non-stop for the last week so we will enjoy today, understood?&rdquo; Harry had a triumphant look on his face despite the fact that all he had achieved so far was the fact that Draco was eating breakfast by eight o&rsquo;clock.</p><p>&ldquo;What have you planned to make you feel so superior, then?&rdquo; Draco finally bothered to break from the scowl that was plastered on his face merely seconds ago; Draco could never resist his lover when he looked so blissfully determined as he did now.</p><p>&ldquo;We, dear love of mine, are going to have a lovely meal and then we are going to the beach.&rdquo;</p><p>A laugh escaped Draco, almost choking him as he tried to get to grips on the fact that Harry had supposedly spent all week planning that.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s face fell as he watched Draco&rsquo;s reaction to his gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not excited for it, it&rsquo;s just that i thought you said that you&rsquo;d spent all week planning that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Harry cried, looking slightly distraught as he crossed his arms defensively across his chest.</p><p>Draco, picking up on this, placed his half-eaten breakfast to one side, crawling over to his boyfriend in order to wrap his arms self-consciously around him. Harry&rsquo;s eyes wondered up to Draco&rsquo;s, a small smile slowly crawling across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so adorable when you&rsquo;re awkward.&rdquo;</p><p>The statement made sense in Harry&rsquo;s head, he just loved complementing everything about his lover. He didn&rsquo;t really care how much sense he was making when all he could do was stare up into the blonde&rsquo;s eyes and remember how in love he was. It was stupid really, but Harry knew today&rsquo;s events would only make him love Draco even more.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As they casually strolled into the shockingly expensive restaurant, Draco couldn&rsquo;t help but realize how attentive Harry was. This place had met all of Draco&rsquo;s expectations and then some: glittering chandeliers hung gracefully from the marble ceiling, pillars constructed from the same pearly marble held the ceiling up, the floor was checkered like a chess board and was so clean Draco swore he could see his own reflection in it, the tables were arranged in no particular format but were dotted around in such a way that flowed and calmed Draco. The couple weren&rsquo;t the only ones that seemed to think so either, as other guests sat at tables which were adorned with gleaming silverware and glasses.</p><p>The waiter swiftly showed them to their seats and took their drink orders, then calmly left them to enjoy their surroundings, not to mention each other as well. For several minutes Draco sat sipping at his white wine, gazing fondly at the stunning venue. Harry merely watched with a soft focus, mind suddenly racing ahead and stressing that something would be suddenly out of place and ruin everything that he had worked so hard to put together, that Draco would hate him for rushing ahead and go ahead and pack up and leave.</p><p>After a while, Draco turned his attention back to messy haired, green-haired beauty that sat before him and grinned. It wasn&rsquo;t often that Draco grinned, but when he did it lit a spark in Harry&rsquo;s chest, infecting his mind and eradicating every sense of panic from his thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for this, love. It is truly wonderful here.&rdquo; Draco seemed so sincere in his thanks and his beautifully perfect face was still alight as a child at a sweet shop, and despite his reaction earlier that day, he was truly in awe by the amount of thought Harry had obviously put into this. Curiosity suddenly bloomed in Draco&rsquo;s mind as he let his mind wonder about Harry&rsquo;s plans for the rest of the day.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>The meal was an overall success as every element of the meal was precise and beautiful and delicious. conversation flowed between the two as it usually did - not much break for breath or food as the both of them giggled at each others jokes, commentated on the venue, and shared stories of the latest happenings - and smiles were far more commonly spread across Draco&rsquo;s face than usual.</p><p>After they had paid for their service, the two men took to the streets as they slowly strolled along the pavement towards the bandstand that stood on luscious grass with the sea rippling not too far into the distance. Draco know nothing of this. He had been told that they were off to the beach. He wasn&rsquo;t even suspicious of Harry&rsquo;s secrecy.</p><p>As they drew closer to the bandstand, Harry&rsquo;s nerves went through the roof, despite Draco still beaming from ear to ear. He had obviously lied to Draco. He had been planning this for far longer than a mere week. If he were being completely honest, he had been planning this since he had first realized his feelings for Draco back at Hogwarts.</p><p>Draco&rsquo;s trance broke as soon as he saw that Harry was no longer listening to a story which he found highly entertaining about a strange encounter he had with a patient at St Mungo&rsquo;s. Concern immediately was evident in both wizard&rsquo;s faces as Draco tugged his lover to a halt.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice wobbled slightly, and he certainly couldn&rsquo;t have that continue if he were to continue on to do what he had been planning to do.</p><p>&ldquo;I was going to ask the same question to you, actually.&rdquo; Draco responded with an eyebrow-raise for effect.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, babe, I promise. Just thinking about work - I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of reports due in.&rdquo; Harry swiftly lied, and he got the effect he so desired when Draco&rsquo;s sincerity was immediately replaced with a smirk and a snort.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should have gotten on and done them before you spend a week planning for my birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s shoulders relaxed ever so slightly at his words. He had to remain inconspicuous until they arrived at their destination, which was even harder as Harry remembered that he had to give the others as much time as possible to prepare every last detail.</p><p>They carried on walking with a safe distance between each other as to avoid as much conflict as possible. It was always like this in public, and it killed both of them to have to bear to stay apart. They&rsquo;d both experienced hate from the wizarding world, and they certainly didn&rsquo;t need the same response from the muggle world. If that were to happen, then it would be practically impossible for either of them to face the world, magic or no.</p><p>Despite not holding hands, there was far much more eye contact than the average pair of straight men. Small smiles were their secret language of affection and adoration while they couldn&rsquo;t admit their undying love for each other on their outings, as much as they wanted to.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>As they approached the rocky shores, Harry knew this was where he would have to start letting Draco in on the secret, and Harry&rsquo;s insecurity indescribably turned into pure excitement and a strange sense of bravery.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going right, actually, Draco.&rdquo; Harry declared as Draco turned to walk along the pathway to his left. </p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re telling me we went to the beach to not go to the beach?&rdquo; Draco&rsquo;s suspicion was beginning, it was only a matter of time before he started asking more awkward questions.</p><p>&ldquo;Just trust me, Ok?&rdquo; Harry said, realizing that was probably the most suspicious thing he could have possibly said. Meanwhile he casually slipped his hands into his coat pockets, his left hand wrapping around the cool metal of the galleon. It sure was a good thing that they had kept those coins from Dumbledore&rsquo;s Army otherwise he would have no way of communicating their arrival to the others. </p><p>Truth be told, he didn&rsquo;t have much of a clue what on earth the bandstand would look like once they arrived, Hermione had insisted that it would look a whole lot better if someone more practical and organized were to deal with those sort of small details while Harry had the basic, yet all-important, job of buying the ring.</p><p>The thought of proposing made Harry shiver with anticipation, yet feel sick to his stomach with dread as his one word answer was either a cobbled stone bridge to run hand-in-hand over, both drunk with joy, or it would be a door slammed in Harry&rsquo;s face with Draco as the receiver on the other side.</p><p>Each step felt heavy and light, tiring yet wiring, a step closer and further. It was torture to endure every step of the way, for both of them. Draco&rsquo;s every step was filled with curiosity and dread, shivers and burst of heat from Harry&rsquo;s half glances. Whatever was waiting for him, whatever secret Harry had kept, he had done a bloody good job of hiding it from him. Either that, or Draco was a lot more ignorant than he thought.</p><p>Just before the grassy hill ended, before Draco got even a single glimpse of what lay behind the mound of dirt, Harry stopped himself as well as Draco so he could look at him before he walked on, before it was too late to turn back.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being very secretive, you know.&rdquo; Draco looked at his boyfriend as he hopped from one foot to the other, a look of anticipation on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Draco laughed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?
